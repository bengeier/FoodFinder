{"text":"Cute brunch spot, great service, enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, and bottomless coffee! If it was my neighbourhood I could see eating here more often"}
{"text":"Chorizo Eggs Benedict. *drops the mic*  Seriously amazing brunch here. I love that they serve it all day because the location is out of the way for me.   Their eggs Benny's are out of this world. Buttery, creamy and perfectly salty. Also they give the option of pairing it with both roasted potatoes and salad! Waistlines rejoice! I wish that was an option everywhere.   I have tried the breakfast burrito - it is filling and delicious.   Drinks: I enjoy the bottomless coffee with a shot of bailey's. The sangria - I would pass on. It's more fruit juicey than wine.  Service is great! The only complaint I have are the bees and flies that pervade the dining area. I wish they'd do something about it, but I guess that is to be expected when the front is open. The chorizo eggs Benny is worth getting stung for (unless you're allergic lol)"}
{"text":"Went for brunch a few times and had the Mexican benny and Salmon benny. Both amazing! Portions are perfect to the point that you're full but not over stuffed, and the food is simple yet full of flavour.Great service with an intimate and welcoming interior. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good but quality control needs to be better. My boyfriend received a poached egg that was missing a yolk. (Rookie mistake) Overpriced for the quantity at $35 for two eggs benedicts.  Server also told us that if someone came in in a larger group they would have to move us to a smaller table. Very rude."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to Huevos almost every single weekend since it opened up just over a year ago. Amazing friendly service, food is always delicious and fresh! Because the food is so fresh it takes no time at all to come out! Real authentic Mexican dishes packed with flavour; The only small tiny con about this place is that there isn't really much French fusion (which is what they're going for), but that's not that big of a deal! Depending on the cook, the seasoning can be lacking but still delicious all the same. My favourite dishes are the Mexican Benedict, Mexican Breakfast and Chicken & Guac sandwich! I definitely recommend checking Huevos Gourmet out if you're looking for fresh and delicious food that is simple yet bursting with flavours :) I might regret posting this review because every time I go back it gets busier and busier ; the word is getting out, lol :)"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place. Food is consistently delicious, and fast.  Cozy and friendly.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were trying to figure out what to have for lunch until our heart for mexican food kicked in. I have never tried Hvuenos before so I figured, why not?! I ordered the Chicken tacos with lettuce instead of tomatoes. They were VERY good.  Hit the spot. My only complai is I wish there was more filling inside the tacos. Besides that it was really good. My coworker ordered one of the sandwiches and loved it. I would love to go back and try their eggs benny sometime!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast & lunch place in the neighborhood! Great fish tacos and ceviche!"}
{"text":"All day breakfast? Count me in! Right on the lakeshore, this place has a great Mexican menu. I had the breakfast burrito and was not disappointed. Delicious! And I highly recommend the Bloody Mary Caesar with bacon. The atmosphere is great with dashes of french parisian accents. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican Food. Fresh Fish Tacos and smoothies. A great hidden gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. They not only offer gluten free options/ take-out, but have great customer service, and the food always hits the spot. I never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience.  Small place,  but the decor was nice.  The music added that special touch.  The service was great.    But most importantly, the food was amazing.  We had the enchiladas and carne asada.   Don't go to those franchise Mexican fast food places. Support the smaller more authentic businesses such as this one.    The menu is different every week so you never know what you will have to choose from.   Great experience and I recommend to all."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food! Can't believe we've been living so close and only just discovered this lovely place. Breakfast is perfectly sized and all the options you'd expect in a Mexican-French restaurant. Can't wait to try all the other options someday soon =)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast yesterday after wanting to come here for awhile and was not disappointed. I have tried every possible place in Etobicoke that you can get breakfast at over the years and I can now say that this may now be my new favourite spot. I loved the Art Deco vibe they had going on inside, the artwork on the walls and the music was awesome. I forget the exact name of what I ordered (will post a picture) but it was gluten free waffles with chicken, with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce on top. For my sides I had half salad half hash browns. OMG is all I can say, but it was absolutely delicious. The waffles were light and the chicken was a shredded texture, almost like pulled pork and had a great spice. The eggs were poached perfectly and had a beautiful runny orange yolk so you could tell they were truly organic (the menu says they use fresh, local eggs). They were not drowned in hollandaise either which was great. I cleaned my whole plate....there were several other things on the menu I wanted to try so I think I will be back very very soon, probably next week lol. What a great little place that makes delicious food, and underrated in my opinion (compared to the regular breakfast places in Etobicoke people go to). I also prefer this place to Goodlake btw, which is very close by."}
{"text":"The poached eggs are perfect! Amazing breakfast burritos with lime guacamole. Well prepared and delivered on time. The coffee is bottomless and available in med and dark roast.   Will be back forsure."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! Fresh and delicious, this is me and my boyfriend's new favorite spot. Heuvos gourmet proves you don't have to sacrifice your health for flavor!"}
{"text":"A great local breakfast spot.  Good selection to choose from on the menu.  My first time checking it out.  It's a good sign to see several regulars there on a Tuesday morning after a long weekend.  Tried the Breakfast Burrito.  Good flavour, nice portion size.  Loved that you could choose to have 1/2 salad and 1/2 hash browns.  And hash browns were homemade!!!  My friend had the Mexican Breakfast and enjoyed a \"spicy breakfast\".    Service was friendly, efficient and unobtrusive.  Interesting art on the walls.  Will definitely go back again to try new menu items."}
{"text":"Heuvos rancheros for breakfast is so awesome! This place is great and priced fair. Would like to see tables spaced better. But certainly a great little place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cozy atmosphere. Friendly quick service. Best chorizo I've ever had (and I'm half Mexican). Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed breakfast this morning.  Huevos Rancheros and fabulous poached eggs.  Loved the rice pudding and our wonderful servers convinced us to try the Churros.  Great way to start our day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious huevos rancheros! The dish reminded me of being in Mexico, with the free range eggs and fresh guacamole.   Simple decor and incredibly friendly staff. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! The food was delicious! Not heavy, very fresh. I had the huevos rancheros with a green smoothie which were absolutely delicious. Great flavour and the guac was fantastic! My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and said it was the best burrito he's ever had. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"After some early hiccups when they first opened, Huevos has really improved. The food has always been good but the service has caught up. Huevos Ranchero is good although the red salsa am the beans are just ok. Awesome homefries and the bennies are great.   We finally have a regular breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"Went to HG for Sunday brunch. Definitely a popular place on Sunday. The place had great ambience with the Latin music playing in the background.  Seating was very close quarters as with all Mom and Pop eat ins in the city.  The menu hosts a slew of Mexican inspired selections that are very enticing. After perusing the menu, I opted for the house specialty, Huevos Rancheros with eggs sunny side up and optional chorizo(a must have!).  Who would have thought that eggs over a tortilla and topped with baked beans and served with fresh guacamole and home fries would work so well together!  You have the savoury of the beans and egg and texture of the chorizo balanced with the freshness of the guacamole, the dish was on point. And all that goodness topped off with fast service and a smile.  Overall, the experience at HG was a pleasurable one.  Huevos Gourmet has definitely earned repeat business from me. 2 forks up!"}
{"text":"Really quite nice.  Had the huevos, very tasty.  The guacamole was some of the best I've had and the potatoes were awesome.  Excellent coffee to boot.  I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Adorable brunch spot with free range eggs and gluten free waffles! A little bit cramped and some dishes lacking in flavour. But there's hot sauce on every table and the menu is full of enticing options. Looking forward to trying something new on my next visit!"}
{"text":"5 stars says it all. Excellent, unique breakfast in etobicoke . I really enjoy it when I get time to go down to lakeshore and eat here. It costs me 20$ for breakfast and worth every bit of it"}
{"text":"Was invited for brunch at this cozy little place and the experience was great.  FOOD/TASTE: Really fresh. Free-run eggs, soft french baguette, crispy tortillas, fresh salad. It's pretty \"plain\" in terms of salt and grease, which I love because you can add that to it, if you would like to. The churros are to die for. Made to order, they are served frest from the kitchen with delicious deeps. All the tacos are really good as well. The only thing I personally would change is the coffee maker as It feels like 2 shots have been added to a latte and it feels really loaded. Fresh orange juice as well  SERVICE: It's great. The owners and servers do their best in greeting you, helping you and accomodate you in their restaurant. You can see they are happy to see you, smiley face all the time.  PRICE: It's reasonable. From $10  SPACE: Tiny but well organized, cozy, really good music and love the paintings and photographs they expose and promote.  VERDICT: Definitely coming back for everything."}
{"text":"Looking for a great, casual, small brunch spot? You found it!! Great funky atmosphere. Mexican music playing in the background. Small seating area - room for approx 34 people - so get here early! Waffles were amazing! Mexican Benedict was a winner! I was missing my family that is living in Mexico, and was looking forward to a great Mexican Breakfast - I got it :)! I personally had the Mexican Breakfast - fresh baguette, tasty chorizo & of course the eggs were done just right.  They have gluten free options & next time we come, a Michelada is in my future!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Friendly, warm and cozy and amazing food!  Mexican Benny is my fav!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and liked both the meals. I tried the huevos rancheros, and also a chicken sandwich. Both were delicious, and both came with tasty salad and potatoes. The only thing I didn't love was the seating. There is this awkward round table in the front, and when that table is full (as it was the one time we were there), no one can get in or out of that area. My poor husband had to get up several times during his brunch to accommodate people coming and going."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was delicious! Huevos Gourmet offers traditional brunch menu items with a tasty Mexican flair and it did not disappoint.   I had the Eggs Benedict with crumbled Chorizo Sausage and it was soooo good. They only use free range eggs and I was drooling over the runny bright orange yolk oozing out. Side salad also tasted fresh and the vinaigrette dressing was light and not too overpowering.   Would definitely come here again to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Adorable, quaint and welcoming!  We were so excited to check this place out and we were not disappointed.  Opted for Ceviche and the daily special (soft tacos with mole chicken).  So good!  Thrilled to see this lovely addition to New Toronto!  Will definitely be coming back.  Make sure to order the Cesar!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for anytime of day. The ambience is cozy and simple and the staff is very friendly. I had the popular dish the huevos rancheros with chorizo, which was delicious. The portion was perfect.   If you aren't looking for brunch there are various traditional mexican dishes worth trying."}
{"text":"wow what a fantastic experience! If you are looking for a greasy spoon 6.95 breakfast experience then keep looking....this place while not cheap offers excellent value.....nice little touches like quality coffee in reg or dark roast,the OJ is fresh squeezed, the eggs are super fresh and free range ( which is immediately apparent once you pierce the perfectly poached yolks by their bright almost orange colour)and the fact that you get to choose between home fries or salad or half and half make this a wonderful choice for a leisurely weekend Brunch. I chose the Eggs Benedict mexican style with Chorizo and guacamole and it was a really creative twist on an old favorite. The service was friendly and super attentive and my order came surprisingly quickly despite being 1030am on a saturday. This establishment is clean as a whistle.! They play lovely mexican music at the perfect volume and support local artists by exhibiting their work on the walls. I dont hand out 5 stars very often and to earn one the food must be flawless but the entire dining experience has to be top notch....Ill be back....and soon!"}
{"text":"I used to live literally a less than 10 minute walking distance from this gem. I walked by it ALL the time and only decided to give it a try recently and I can say I am in love! The inside feels like you're in a cozy home, it's incredibly small so go early! I went right at open at 9am and it filled up by 9:20am.. Food is fantastic! I've never been/heard of a mexican fusion breakfast joint so I love that it's different. Their pressed juices taste very fresh as well! Service is always friendly and attentive. Highly recommend going! :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I got the eggs Benedict, very impressed. Everything from the home fries to the salad was good. Service was fast and our server was helpful. I have been to other Mexican brunch places and this one wins every time. Just make sure to book a table before going as they get crowded very fast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely orgasmic.   Fresh, clean delicious goodies with gluten free bread options (the good kind- not dry or cardboard like).   Green smoothie, salmon and eggs and black coffee were to die for.   So much love for this place."}
{"text":"Another little gem in Lakeshore's west end. Great menu, feeshly made that can catter your taste for Mexican food without alienating someone just looking for your regular brunch. Owner is always there and the service is great."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was excellent. Adding chorizo is always a great idea. Home fries were perfectly tender yet crispy. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking for brunch spot in this area and I am so happy to find this joint.  It is not spacious but it is cozy, lovely atmosphere... makes me miss Mexico.   Anyway, I tried the green lemonade and it was really went well with this mexican style breakfast. Also, highly recommend to try house special Huevos rancheros! Its fresh, flavourful...mmmm. My husband had their delicious omelette and it was so tasty. Try this with chorizo.    If you live in this neighbourhood, I highly recommended it."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot will for sure be going back. I had the mexican eggs benny with a raspberry mojito absolutely delicious and well worth the wait.   Although its an all day breakfast place it would be worth while to come a little early as they ran out of ingredients for 2 drinks (ones we wanted)   Tip: if its really crowded put your name and number down and theres a really nice cafe about a 2 min walk away we had a latte and got a call about 30 mins later."}
{"text":"We had the smoke salmon benedict, huevos rancheros, coffee and green smoothie. Coffee was great even though it's bottomless, the taste is good! The smoothie was not too sweet and food was good portion and great taste. We will definitely come back again for another awesome weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Update: so I've been thinking about how great breakfast was for literally two weeks, so I made the drive into Etobicoke again today. I was not disappointed. The Mexican eggs Benny is seriously OUT OF THIS WORLD! I had every intention of trying something new, but why fix what's not broken, am I right? Thank you for filling my belly with such yumminess. And for the amazing churros. Oh my, soooo good. This place, the vibe, the food, it all makes me happy.    Oh.My.Huevos!!  Drove from Oakville to eat here on the recommendation of a friend. I was definitely impressed and will return (soon). Ordered the Mexican Eggs Benny, I only ever order Eggs Benny, so I know a good one when I eat it, and let me just say, I WILL ONLY EVER EAT THEM HERE from now on. They were by far THEE BEST I have ever had! The homemade guac was killer, the chorizo was incredible and the hollandaise sauce was spot on. Half/half of salad and home fries was the perfect amount of all things yummy.  SERIOUSLY AMAZING. Everyone else enjoyed their meals thoroughly also...Mexican breakfast & breakfast burrito.  Can't wait to come back.... Maybe tomorrow?"}
{"text":"Love this brunch spot!!  They put a unique Mexican twist to your brunch dishes!  My fave is the Mexican Eggs Benedict!  The green smoothie is also amazing!  Super small restaurant so come early or be prepared to wait!  Service is usually pretty good - but sometimes they get so busy that you might have to ask for things twice (e.g., water)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Etobicoke. I've been searching for a great brunch place in the area and was so happy to find them. Delicious food, friendly staff and beautiful art on the walls make this place a must!"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food and if you like brunch, you can't go wrong.  My wife and I enjoyed the authentic Mexican flavours, bottomless coffee and hospitality.  It was nice to be offered half salad and half roasted potatoes as a side rather than picking one or the other. Looking out the window, you almost feel like you're on vacation in another city. Maybe that's just me... :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their menu is delicious, I can always find something I want, the French music adds lots of charm. The space itself is lovely and bright. I wish they would open up for dinners!"}
{"text":"Solo yummy !! Had their breakfast special ( basically a Mexican breakfast ) and it was delicious. My daughter had a fresh berry salad and she loved it.  Split a gluten free waffle for dessert.  It too was great.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing! from the time we walked in to the time we left, I have not a single complaint about this place.   we called on our way in and asked approximately how long the wait would be for 2, she said we'd be seating right away as there were a few tables clearing out shortly. We only waited a few minutes when we got there for the table to be cleaned.   Water came out right away and shortly followed by the coffee we ordered.  I got the eggs benny and my girlfriend got the hurvert special. the flavour the food came out with was amazing - definitely recommend both dishes!   the server didn't rush us at all, didn't make us feel like we needed to leave as soon as our meal was done and she even checked up on us just enough.   definitely will return here again to try something else!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Since moving to the area I was bummed that there weren't many local breakfast/brunch spots in the area. Not there aren't good ones, but with so few, once they're busy, you're pretty much stuck waiting.   Driving west on lakeshore near islington, you'd likely judge the area and assume there isn't anything worth stopping at, and truth be told, I'd seen the sign for this spot in past and not given it a second thought.   This past weekend when the brunchies hit, I opened Yelp and came across this spot and actually stopped to read the reviews and look at the pictures. It looked amazing so we figured we'd be adventurous and give it a try  We arrived shortly before 10am on Sunday and were seated instantly (Good timing too because the restaurant seemed to get packed within 20 minutes of our arrival). It's a super small place with Maybe 20 seats. The menu is as you would expect, Mexican inspired takes on traditional breakfast items.   My girlfriend had their signature Huevos Rancheros which had a healthy dollop of excellent guacamole on the side of eggs and beans served over tortillas. She loved it. I went with the Mexican Benedict which was an English muffin with guacamole spread on it before being topped with chorizo sausage meat, eggs and then hollandaise sauce.   The best part for me is that this place was the answer to my long sought after question/dilemma - why can't I ever get a third Benedict?!?! You typically get 2 Benedicts in an order but for me that leaves me hungry still, I don't want to order a whole other meal but I feel like a third Benedict would satiate me totally. This has bend my elusive unicorn as most restaurants won't make you that third Benny. Not HG!! Right on their menu it gives you a 2 Benny or 3 Benny option. Hallelujah!   I mean at that point they were getting a 5th star regardless but then I tried the churros for dessert (yes dessert at breakfast!) and it solidified any minor question of whether this would be a 4.5, 4.75 or 5.   Looks like I found a new local brunch spot. Next time we eat breakfast burritos!   Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Had their house basic egg breakfast. It was average. Not particularly flavourful. The toast was a cheap white roll with what tasted like margarine on it.  Nothing special. The staff stressed that they had medium and dark coffee. Free refills.  Everyone at the table agreed on a rating of 3 stars. Not bad but not great. It's acceptable in an area not known for good food."}
{"text":"Read the reviews, and after eating here twice, the food is amazing! We both had the Huevos rancheros with the chorizo, wow! Best we have ever had, seriously! Guacamole, sooo good. Have lived in the area for more than 15 years, and are so thrilled to have found this little gem"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  The huevos rancheros are delicious and the coffee here is great (proper espresso coffee not that brew stuff)  Staff are very friendly and the price is good for what you get.  Will be coming back a lot"}
{"text":"A random trip to the suburbs during breakfast time left me feeling very, very hangry. I couldn't wait to get back to the city to then line up for brunch (seriously get it together Toronto), and so proceeded to yelp my way into finding a decent brunch spot on the way back that wasn't your run of the mill eggs benny and pancake.  In comes huevos gourmet. A small place located at Lakeshore and Islington (what google calls the \"New Toronto\" area), it is a Mexican breakfast joint. It definitely has your eggs benny and omelettes but with the seasonings and flavour of Mexico. I got the huevos rancheros, which is without a doubt one of my favourite breakfast offerings.   This one wasn't bad - needed heat to it (but I guess this way it is more palatable for everyone), and there is hot sauce on the table for you to spice it up. It needed a bit more acid and cilantro but overall it was good and I would come back for it. It comes with a side of potatoes or salad (or get both like I did and enjoy!) and the huevos rancheros are served with buttery, crispy baguettes which is perfect for mopping up the yolks. Oh and the guacamole is fantastically good! Authentic and fresh.    The tables are very, very tiny which makes it awkward to eat at times. The service was fantastic and I loved the artwork and pictures on the wall.  Would definitely come back to try some other things on the menu to get a true rating of the place."}
{"text":"OMG, I cannot say enough things about their breakfast of fabulousness. The eggs he uses are brighter than the sun, they are so orange I couldn't believe it. A thing of beauty. Their gluten free waffles were so delicious. I highly recommend going there for breakfast. It isn't a cheap greasy spoon, it will cost you and you're paying for the quality of the ingredients. If you believe you're worth it, then the price is right."}
{"text":"Favourite breakfast place in the city for me, especially since I am so close to it. Huevos Rancheros, Mexican Eggs Benny are my favourites. The breakfast burrito is really good too."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Had the steak and eggs.  Steak was nice and lean.  Price was reasonable.  Only draw back was there wasn't much seating and no A/C but that was not a problem when air went on a Sunday mid morning.  Definitely go again to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place so far!! Cute little restaurant , amazing food and great service. I ordered the Mexican eggs Benny (to die for) and we also tried the French toast (best French toast I've ever had) also you must try the Mexican lemonade , it's sort of a lemonade and cucumber mix ...so refreshing in the past I've tried the regular breakfast with chorizo sausage and the omelette with chorizo and cheese , have not been disappointed by and of the dishes ! Super friendly staff you have to check this place out"}
{"text":"I took the Mexican eggs benny. Really yummy and generous portion. Food was great. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5/5 was because it was a little messy and worn down. The tables were old and really scratched up. Some items could be updated. And they had the patio doors open with lots of wasps circling so it felt uncomfortable, since the place is really small and tight. Tables were tiny with little room to maneuver around your plate. But food wise, excellent."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot on lakeshore.  Very sold eggs Benny and the Mexican Benedict was awesome.  Good service and overall a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, eggs and waffles place with a Mexican twist. I ordered the Mexican waffles for lunch - highly recommend. Lots of gluten free options as well. Server was very efficient and provided great service. The music and general ambiance is also very good."}
{"text":"Favorite place for brunch in the neighbourhood , love the Mexican Benedict  and the waffle Benedict, always slammed and the staff are lovely .  Side note - I think the owner shaved his moustache"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place in the neighbourhood!  The front of the store is a bit unassuming, but we stepped inside right as the place was open at 8 on a Sunday, and it was cozy and quaint. We were offered medium or dark roast coffee (it's bottomless at $2.50). Each person in our group of three got different items. We went with the Mexican benedict, the huevos rancheros, and the french toast made of croissants.  My huevos rancheros was absolutely delicious. It was seasoned with tons of flavour, and accompanied by some hash browns. I also opted to add chorizo (around $3 to do so), which was slightly spicy and a great accompaniment. We also added chorizo to the benedict, another good call. They also had gluten free options on the menu, plus a separate brunch drink menu.  The service was very quick, effective and friendly. We ended our meal with the churros (4 total, with a white chocolate sauce). For a meal for 3, the bill came to $50 - not bad at all.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Now before I begin I really did mean to take a picture of my good post review so I could post it with my review, but I took one look at it and dived in. I had the GDL(?) burger and the flavor of the burger with the avocado blew both of my socks off. The chipotle dip on the side drove through the tastebuds bonkers! Even my partner who is a picky eater and doesn't usually like burgers loved it! The waitress told us to come back in the morning for breakfast and you bet your tush we will!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Huevos at least three times, and everybody has loved their meal each time. I had some hashbrown trouble the first time, but all potatoes have been cooked well in every recent visit since then so I will write that off to a bad potato day.  I had the breakfast burrito twice, and it's one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had!  If you're near Islington and Lakeshore and looking for either good breakfast food, or mexican-themed snack, drop in and check out the menu!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe on the Lake Shore. Super busy but the wait wasn't that long (10min.) Customer service is excellent and the food is really tasty! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place.  Such tasty food I tried a few different egg dishes and all were really good I even had a churros as a dessert with my breakfast!  Really good  The staff is friendly Place is clean  Im sure you will like it"}
{"text":"Cute brunch place! I ordered the huevos rancheritos and it was amazing. Guac was fresh as well."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday, around 11 am. We were arrested quickly,  at the last available table,  which we took to be a good sign.   We placed our beverage order right away,  asking for waters (we had been in a long walk! ). Our water never arrived,  And another server arrived to ask if we would like to order drinks.  We both requested coffee, and water again. Two coffees arrived,  And one water (whatever,  we'll  share). Neither of the servers we encountered were very friendly,  although they were not rude at all. We can forgive mediocre service, as it was quite busy.  We emptied our coffees, and waited to place our orders. We waited about 10 minutes,  which seemed like a long wait as we had already been sitting about 20 minutes total. I will say the option of medium or dark roast coffee is a nice to have. My eggs Benedict were flavorless, which was so disappointing. Hollandaise sauce is something I only treat myself to once in awhile and this one tasted nothing like the buttery thick and smooth sauce I was going for.  The breakfast burrito was dry,  And not very exciting for a Mexican brunch restaurant.  Our\"bottomless \" coffees were only refilled once, and come in very small mugs. We were lacking in caffeine ayy the end of our meal.  The pricing seemed very high for the quality of the food and service we received. Having noticed that most people rate this restaurant very high,  we might try again and hope that this was an \"off\" day....but not any time soon."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've had a perfectly executed bene. The yolk oozed as soon as the blade pierced through the egg white. We will find reasons to be back in the area and order the Mexican Benedict!!"}
{"text":"This place is straight fire , went for breakfast.   It's a small place and was packed so I took it to go.  Had the Mexican Benedict, the best eggs benedict I've ever had.   Highly recommended and will definitely be coming back.   Add salsa verde to spice up your life."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy as heck on the weekends, but worth the wait. The food has always been tasty. Their almond milk lattes are a necessity.   The service is spotty at times, but I think it depends on the rush. Wish they'd adjust the seating, so you had a bit more personal space as well as add a curtain by the door during the winter months."}
{"text":"Visited Huevos Gourmet over the weekend, just because some friends told me about it and I wanted to know what the hype was all about.  Maybe we had bad luck that day?, but our visit was unfortunately not what we were expecting at all.  Ordered the huevos rancheros, which were OK, but nothing to write home about (I was expecting way more, for the price they charge for the plate), plus the food was a bit cold when it arrived at our table. My friend played it safe by getting an omelette, and she found it edible, but again, nothing special.  One thing we really didn't like at all was the taste of the coffee: too bitter for us, and it left a weird aftertaste in our mouths after each sip. They offer bottomless coffee cups, but I barely managed to finished my first one, and I had to switch to ice water afterwards; my friend really disliked the coffee and was smart enough to stop drinking it after the first sip. A breakfast place that has bad quality coffee is a huge unforgivable mistake.  I might come back one day to give it another chance, but in the end, our breakfast turned out to be really expensive, and disappointing. And although we spent a big amount of money for a breakfast experience that left us unfulfilled, I think it hurt more that we wasted a weekend morning going to a place that we really didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"I hardly ever give five star reviews, but even I couldn't find anything to complain about here. Not surprisingly, the menu is Mexican-inspired, but it was nice to find an ambience that matched. There was a charming old-world feel to this little cafe that differentiates it from many of the cookie-cutter hipster brunch joints that have been popping up as of late.   Our server was very nice, and took the time to help us make our brunch choices. Everything on the menu was around $10, which is pretty much a steal for a decent brunch these days. Traditional Mexican dishes like huevos rancheros, burritos, and tacos dominated the menu, but there were also more common breakfast offerings like eggs Benedict and omelettes for those not willing to venture out. I ended up getting a burger off the lunch menu, as recommended by our server. It was topped with guac, cheese, bacon, and chipotle mayo and the meat was amazing. Tasted more like a steak or prime rib burger than ground beef. They also let you get half fries, half salad for your side for those who can never choose or who like to have the best of both worlds.   I highly recommend this cute little brunch spot, for its ambience as much as for its amazing food. The server mentioned that it can be hard to get a seat on the weekends, so don't be surprised if you have to wait but I assure you it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch or lunch place. The food is tasty, as if it was home made. The drinks are fairly priced and really good. The waitresses are friendly and sweet. The atmosphere is hip and the art on the walls gives the space an upscale vibe!! 5 stars for an over all great brunch experience !"}
{"text":"The breakfast is amazing!! the scrambled eggs are done to perfection!! the coffee is okay and service is okay too! The toast salsa and hollandaise are all excellent.The place is cozy and vibrant!"}
{"text":"i don't eat eggs (allergies) and the waitress was not accommodating. She kept insisting i add eggs to my brunch and wouldn't let me substitute for more beans or an alternative. Food was overall good, juice is a little overpriced!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! I can't recall having such an overall satisfying meal. Toronto is filled with restaurants and it's such stiff competition however, this place surely stands out for anyone that tries it.  It has a great Queen West vibe on Lakeshore in Etobicoke. It's a small place but if you get stuck in a small line it is definitely worth the wait.  Start off, coffee was nice with constant refills. I took a look at the \"brunch beverages\" however, after the previous night all I really wanted was coffee and water. Any other brunch outing I would have tried any of them. They also have a nice list of fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.   Now, let's get to the good part -- food! I had the huevos rancheros and oooohhhhh emmmm geeee! So good! I won't deny that I make a fantastic guacamole so I'm always looking for something with quality flavour - with the red onions, it added a really nice addition to the meal and the baguettes were nice and crispy.   I live in the area but typically find myself downtown however, this may be my new breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are always friendly and the food is spectacular if you're looking for a good Mexican breakfast/brunch. I've gone here a few times with my girlfriend and have never been disappointed. Get the chorizo with anything you get, it's amazing, and they do a good smoothie here too (Mango is the winner). Definitely a great spot if you're feeling a hangover too, but be warned it can get quite busy on a Sat/Sun morning so be prepared to have to either wait a bit or be turned away! Worth a 10 minute wait though!"}
{"text":"You know what? We love this place for some outstanding, Mexican style breakfast.   You know why? Because they beautifully add a little spice and flavour to traditional breakfast options.   You know what else? The Mexican eggs Benedict is unreal. Perfectly poached eggs on a delicious hollandaise sauce, fresh crispy english muffin, and a nice touch of spice with chorizo and hot sauce.   Not to mention, Mexican western omelette? Don't mind if I do!  We'll be back. Over and over.  Love it."}
{"text":"I adore their breakfast items, except for the cactus. Cactus did nothing for me.  They have delicious coffee, are great with kids and they are always busy. You can expect to wait 20 minutes for a table on the weekends. They are pretty good about allergies. Gluten-free is not a problem for them, 99% of the time. My wife with celiac's disease prefers them for that reason. But just once, she had a reaction from eating there. Just once, which is a better track record than many restaurants we've tried."}
{"text":"I really need to get over my love of Mexican food ... but it's so hard. Especially when you discover little gems like Huevos Gourmet. Located on Lakeshore, it's a welcome spot in a neighbourhood that is slowly changing for the better. The menu has enough choices that you don't feel overwhelmed. I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was love at first bite. The beans and tortilla were perfection, especially once the yolk of the egg combined with them. My only complaints and they are minor, customers should receive more napkins (breakfast can get messy) and they really need to do a better job washing the glasses."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with this place. It's a really small joint but it's super cute and has character. The food was great, the service can probably be a bit better. The only reason it's not a 5 star for me is because this was the first time in 3 months (after having my baby) that I went out with a girlfriend for brunch and after our meal, we just wanted to sit and chat for a bit. Several different waitresses and even the owner came up to us asking if we needed anything else, basically rushing us to leave because there were other people waiting for a table. We didn't care though, we took our time and enjoyed the couple of hours that we had out together. People can wait or get a larger place."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious, authentic Mexican. Give this place shot, will not disappoint. Support local business. Raspberry Mojitos, delightful. Nachos, fish tacos, and chicken taquitos, all excellent. And they have churros! Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Loved it! Would definitely go  again. Had a quesadilla for breakfast and it waz incredible"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food....here's the go to place. Neighborhood is not so classy but this is a true hidden gem. Heuvos rancheros and a caesar (drink) is my dish of choice and would highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"love their food. Absolutely the best  option in the neighbourhood....BUT having a bill add up to $50 for 2 means our visits are few and far between. Also found with a full house the one server can't seem to handle all the covers and service wanes...and at that price tag it doesn't leave one with a great feeling when the bill arrives. Another server and a few bucks shaved off the menu would have me there much more often."}
{"text":"I wanted something different for lunch and decided to stop by this place. I had a burrito with chorisco and a side of lettuce and potatoes. It was so good! There is so much flavour! It's great that we finally have something new in the area besides more pizza shops! I can't wait to go back and bring some of my friends! Delish!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little breakfast place! It was great to try something different for breakfast rather then having the traditional pancake eggs bacon.. etc. Here at huevos gourmet they bring a Mexican twist to your breakfast and it's amazing! Eggs, chorizo, salsa, torillas and jalapeño definitely gave a kick to start my day. I'll definitely be coming back! It's a small place on lakeshore so you might want to plan ahead and expect a bit of a wait before going. You'll have to pay for parking as well. They do take names down and will call when your table is ready."}
{"text":"4.5 stars Wait time for a group of 6 was 10 minutes on a Saturday around 1pm - not bad at all but definitely shouldn't linger either after you're done since the restaurant is small.   This is basically brunch with a Mexican twist.   I ordered the huevos rancheros and LOVED it - may even be one of my favourite brunch meals ever! The guacomole was amazing.   I tried my friend's vegetarian quesadilla and it was OK. It was actually more like empanadas so my friend expecting a typical quesadilla was disappointed. The salsa that accompanied it though was really tasty.   Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place in the Etobicoke area. We ordered Mexican Breakfast and Mexican Benedict, both with half salad half home fries, and 2 coffees (refillable). The bill came up to be around $35. The food was great and portion really filling. For the next visit, I'd be really interested to try their smoothies!   The service was great and the owner very friendly, asked if we wanted to take some extra coffee to go. The space was really small and felt really compact as it was really packed during our visit there."}
{"text":"I've lived in Etobicoke my whole life and always missed the presence of little hipster downtown restaurants so I love to see little gems like this pop up. This place has the tastiest spin on eggs Benny I've ever had! Fun atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Really cute spot although I'd recommend removing the fake flowers from the ceiling fixtures and perhaps adding a bit to the meals (prices are a bit high) ...but...you won't be disappointed. Call ahead to make sure they are open and once there, don't forget to order their Bloody Mary/Ceasars served with bacon on top, especially if you've had one too many the night before :) also, tip: get half & half on the side (half salad & half potatoes - the best of both worlds)"}
{"text":"Good place to have a breakfast good quality! Cozy and small place! Server are very friendly! Must try the orange juice very good!"}
{"text":"One of the most impressive points about this restaurant, is the surrounding area. As someone who lived here for a few years on Lakeshore, there are constant vacancies. I'm not sure what it is about this kipling  to Royal York area/ stretch. Very little works and very little ever lasts. So obviously to have a restaurant with over a hundred Yelp reviews, a steady clientele, much kudos to the owners and staff. I enjoyed the huevos breakfast, the classic smoothie was also good. I think $6.50 for a basic strawberry and banana smoothie is a lot to charge. The strong menu of breakfast and other items is also not a cheap eat. It's definitely one of those restaurants I would visit more often if it were a couple bucks cheaper per meal. The interior is on the smaller size, I pretty much was a part of a incredibly chatty woman's conversation a table away. Her fascinating dialogue about all the health food bar options, seem to never end. If you are going alone, headphones might be a good suggestion."}
{"text":"Three stars for now. Based on the existing reviews which prompted me to check out this place (never mind the fact that this is walking distance from where I live), I think my 3 y.o. son and I had breakfast there on the wrong day. I had the breakfast burrito and my son had the huevos breakfast. They were just both ok. I ordered apple juice but because I ordered it for my son they put it in a kid's size cup. For $3 I felt I was duped. The coffee was bottomless. The service was just ok as well.  I have faith in this place so I'm gonna go back here. Plus the fact that I support local businesses. I'll update this review on my next visit and hopefully with more stars."}
{"text":"I had the eggs salmon that were incredibly delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise was so creamy. They had a few horrible customers that were so self centred but the staff were not phased by them. People the restaurant is busy, there are 2 of you so no you can't sit at a table for 5 to hold hands and ogle each other."}
{"text":"I love brunch restaurants and always love trying out a new hot brunch spot whenever possible. But this place is lacking flavor big time and quite confusing. Mexican brunch... maybe. French? not so much.   We were there this past Saturday to check. I had the mexican omelette and my girlfriend had the Eggs Benny. The omelette was a little too oily for my taste. The Eggs Benny is pretty standard, nothing to write home about. The homefries could use a little more salt.    Something worth noted the menu looks identical to Easy restaurant in Roncesvalle Village. It lacks a certain degree of authenticity."}
{"text":"I can be a bit of a coffee snob. Nothing worse that a poorly made latte. The latte I had when I went for breakfast was perfect. The food was delicious and portions generous. The staff was friendly w/out being fake or overbearing. The restaurant was clean and well decorated. I had waffles which were really good and i will definitely be going back to try other dishes. The one thing to bear in mind is that it is a small restaurant. So I'm sure that in prime times on the weekend there might be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"At first I was a little confused by the concept of a Mexican/French breakfast place but they pull it off with ease. We shared the breakfast burrito with a side of chorizo which had nice flavour but not too hot. Excellent food and really nice service and ambiance. Portions are really generous and the menu really has something for everyone.   We live 3 blocks away and this neighbourhood is really lacking in good restaurants although that seems to be changing (e.g. Good Lake and Ember Social Lounge).It is nice to see well thought out businesses rather than Vape lounges and Money Marts.  Very good restaurant and a unique breakfast experience. Mojito wasn't bad either! Best of luck and we will be recommending to friends. Trying to convince people that TO does not end at Roncy!! Nice job."}
{"text":"I live one block away and I've pasted this place like a thousand times. It doesn't look so attractive from outside, but when I came in today I was so amazed. Food is so delicious and despite the fact that it was kinda busy our plates arrived pretty fast. I am sure I'm gonna go there again."}
{"text":"Awesome little breakfast joint. Service is quick and friendly. Food is fantastic & just the right amount of spicy.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite brunch spots in the west end, I'm so lucky to live close to it. The food is always delicois and I love that the Mexican Benedict comes with ground chorizo- way better!  I love love love this place"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast places I've been to in a while. Make sure to try their Salmon Benedict!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh this place is so good! My friend and I came in around 1 pm and it was busy! Luckily there was some tables available so we were seated quickly. Started off with a pineapple mimosa and a guava/tangerine mimosa which were great! Good size for it's worth, we definitely want to try the other drinks that are available. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo and he got the breakfast burrito, also with chorizo- both with half salad and half home fries . So delish!!! I was worried it was going to be salty but it wasn't!! Flavour was on point and everything was super fresh. The portions were great and we were so full. Waitresses were very attentive and quick, really nice girls. Definitely a staple brunch spot now, esp. on sundays when you can park for free on  the street"}
{"text":"Wow. I think I have a brunch crush. I like brunch on a regular day, but I didn't LOVE brunch until I came to Huevos Gourmet. If you want a delicious, carefully prepared, tasty, well-priced brunch/breakfast, served by genuinely friendly, caring staff, this is the place for you. It's ambiance is a mix of charming and quirky. While it has massive ornament balls the size of two heads dangling from a portion of the ceiling, the eccentricity is contrasted with interesting, stylish art hung on the walls. In short, the atmosphere has character. It's cute, it's zany, and yet it's humble. And it knows good food.  We arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch at 9:30 AM. We parked right on the Lakeshore, right across the restaurant, where parking was $1.00 an hour. The restaurant was moderately full when we arrived, but we were cheerfully greeted and given our choice of the remaining tables. Our server was so friendly, so warm, keeping an attentive eye on us.  We ordered: a) the Huevos Rancheros, b) the Mexican Benedict, and c) Mexican brewed coffee in medium roast. Can I just say that their guacamole is made of magic? It's deep, fully of body, and a slice of heaven when slathered on the crunchy baguettes served with the Huevos Rancheros. I normally scarf down my food when I'm hungry, but I savoured each bite of the Mexican Benedict. It was perfectly cooked, with a nice kick, with the perfect amount of sauce. Hats off to the chef. Delicious.  For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to approximately $37.00. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Would've been nice with some chicken or beef bacon options.  Otherwise a great place and great food.   Small but cozy. Great, friendly staff. Dark roast coffee is delicious. Food is great too and fresh.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wow.  The variety and depth of food and beverage choices were amazing.  Two types of coffee and proper tea pots plus premium teas were so appreciated.   Our breakfast was amazing and this place is a must-eat destination."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for lunch during the Labour Day long weekend and, let me tell you, this is one of the best restaurants we've been to in a very long time.  We were pleasantly surprised as to quality of the food and the pride the chef took in making it.  It's relatively easy to locate if you're a local but if you're travelling in, it's located on the north side of Lake Shore, just east of Sixth Street.  If you can't find street parking, there's a large parking lot on Sixth (north).  It's a relatively small restaurant, which I recall it having about eight tables and four barstools that faced the street.  The bloody ceasar was like no other ceasar I've ever tried - lots of horseradish, spice, bacon on top and they didn't go cheap with the vodka.  I'm no taco connoisseur but the fish tacos were dynamite - the fish was light, crispy but not oily and I loved the cabbage and carrot slaw as the carrot added a little natural sweetness, which really brought everything together.  My husband had the Eggs Benedict and he loved it.  Judging from the colour of the egg yolk, we just knew they used the best quality eggs. I must say that I'm a bit confused as to the reviews that mentioned the food lacking flavour.  The three people at the table beside us were going on and on about how delicious the food was and I kept hearing the older gentleman saying how it was the best ceasar he ever drank in his life!  Nobody has mentioned this yet but I really digged the French bistro-type music they played in the background. Service was exceptional - waitress was friendly and attentive, food arrived fairly prompt and hot and the owner made sure to thank everyone when they were leaving.  We will definitely be going back (hopefully next weekend).  My only complaint would be that I wished they either used tablecloths or had tables with a not so \"slippery\" finish. Due to the condensation from the drinks, it caused the plates and glasses to shift around a lot during our meal; however, we just laid napkins down and it was fine.  Overall - five stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and service!  Love the addition to the neighbourhood.  Breakfast burrito could have been seasoned a bit more."}
{"text":"The open window at the front of the restaurant immediately caught our attention as we were passing by so we decided to check it out for lunch. We were not disappointed!   This cozy little place quickly filled after we sat down and I can see why! We had the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and an order of tacos. They actually use real rotisserie chicken where you can taste the freshness. No frozen food here! The home fries were so flavourful and fluffy (?) I don't know how it's done but they were the best home fries I have ever had. Served with chipotle mayo you can't go wrong. My mom had the tacos and was equally impressed with her meal. I can't wait to go back!!  My one word of advice is to perhaps have more than one server worker. Our service was sufficient but since the restaurant was full it wasn't the wow service I hoped it could have been.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and was looking for good place to have breakfast. Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a shot.   Parking on the street was easy on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant has curb appeal, it feels like walking into a Spanish family's home, and the service and food reflects that as well.  I had the Mexican Omelette which was a great carb free option (pass on the bread and potatoes). It was delicious, came out quick.  Definitely will become a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Love this place ! I've been here for breakfast twice. They're typically very busy so when we went, there was a bit of a small wait. My fav dish is their Mexican eggs Benedict- just simply perfect! I also really enjoyed their green smoothie, which was a healthy mix of fruit and vegetables. The atmosphere is casual, eclectic, and charming. Prices are reasonable and the service is quick. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast joint and I'd return. Both of us enjoyed our mains, though the side salads were lame - a scant handful of mixed greens with dressing that was barely detectable. Coffee was OK. The decor was kinda fun, but tired and worn. If you want a tasty main and don't care about impressing anyone with ambiance, this joint will work."}
{"text":"Delicious food, we both finished everything on our plates. Decor was romantic yet cute, enjoyed our late Sunday brunch as it was served all day."}
{"text":"Just wanted to upgrade the rating for this place.  We have been back a couple of more times and have had great food and super friendly service.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall Mexican fusion breakfast/brunch place on Lakeshore in South Mimico.  I was reluctant to try them because it sounded like it was going to mess up Mexican food by trying too hard to be fancy.  Then I caved in and went....and I am so very glad I did.  The food is beautiful, fresh, and delicious.  The waitstaff is friendly.  And the place is usually packed....so if you want in expect a wait.  Would definitely recommend this place  for a different sort of brunch place."}
{"text":"Shhh... don't tell too many people that this place is off the hook for a hipster-like weekend brunch experience that is family friendly and quite tasty... yet the main clientele is a hipster avocado-toast eating millennial crowd.   Hi you are tired of eating \"The Canadian Breakfast -- 3 eggs, toast, sausauge/bacon and home fries...\" you got to eat here and enjoy their Mexican inspired brunches.   A bonus is that the servers are eye candy... if you care... expect to be waited on by beautiful twenty-something friendly and smart waitresses."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, great food, good atmosphere! I would definitely go back, I'm the kind of person who loves a heavy breakfast, but my husband on the other hand found the food a bit to adventurous for the morning! Definitely come here if you're into salsa and guac anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Free range eggs used in their all day breakfast.  Freshly squeezed OJ to wash it down.  The perfect start of any morning."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm!!! A delicious mexican brunch experience. Strongly recommend and just like Arnold, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered off the wrong part of the menu??  I've had Huevos Gourmet bookmarked for a while now, based on the favourable reviews, but just managed to visit today while I was in the area.  There are 2 sides of the menu that consists of All-Day Breakfast and a more Mexican-inspired \"All Day Lunch\" menu.  (To be honest, I'm not really a fan of All-Day Breakfast UNLESS I'm extremely lazy or hungover which the latter never really happens.  It's just not really my thing 'cause I can do this sorta thing at home, so when I'm forced to go out for a Caucasian-style brunch, I try not to order the standards like eggs, bacon, toast, etc.  It's still difficult to wrap my head around why this is even a thing.)  So due to my disdain for going out for brekkie, I ordered off the more Mexican portion.  I got the GDL Burger while my friend got to Chicken Soft Tacos.    GDL BURGER -  love the fresh, soft bun -  ingredients were fresh -  hand-cut fries were indeed cut by hand, but they weren't drained from the oil, so they were still shiny and soggy  :( -  couldn't taste any guac -  patty itself was seasoned well, but it was sorta dry (probably frozen)  TACOS -  I never tasted them, but my friend said they needed some crunch, more veg (shredded cabbage, more cilantro) and acid -  friend said chicken was well-seasoned -  salsa that was included looked like it was from a jar  Based on this meal, the food was just aw-ight.  Nothing incredibly memorable, but I did enjoy the friendly atmosphere and the fact that they played Dean Martin's \"Cha Cha Cha D'amour\" in the background."}
{"text":"I've been to Huevos about 5 times now and it never disappoints - it's my go-to spot for brunch on the weekends as I live about 4km away and always bring all my friends here. The eggs yolks are so orange and fresh. I've had the Huevos Rancheros, the waffles and my favourite - the Mexican Eggs Benedict. By far my favourite mexican brunch food.   The juices & lattes are also fantastic. Would highly recommend, although probably better for groups of 4 or less since it is a smaller place and gets VERY busy."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places we've been to. The food is delicious and the staff is great. The portions are really generous and -aside from the great taste- the food actually looks gorgeous with all the garnish and colour."}
{"text":"Saw photos of eggs benny served here so I had to try it out. Place has street parking right outside (free on Sundays).  Atmosphere here is relaxed and welcoming. We did not have to wait long for our server to take our order and wait for the food to come.   Eggs benny was decent, I have definitely had much better bennies in the past. I personally prefer the hollandaise sauce to be creamier (and a bit more)."}
{"text":"Love this spot! We always try to get there early as there are no reservations, but we haven't had an issue getting in. The space is small but comfortable. They are open most holidays too, so it is a great breakfast option on a day when you don't want to cook. But call ahead to be sure they are open!  Their grapefruit juice goes down good, and they have 2 choices of coffee, a medium and a dark roast.  I've only had the huevos rancheros with the chorizo added on top, but that is all I ever want!"}
{"text":"For brunch this Mexican restaurant with a French accent was enjoyed by the family. The fish tacos were fresh and tasty, soft taco chorizo was a good portion and nice and spicy. While Edith Pfaff type music serenaded Eggs Benedict contradicted the menu. The peameal was slight. Ceviche was a needed more cilantro less fish but all in all this mexibistro is a nice addition to Lakeshore Village."}
{"text":"My first morning in Toronto started with a delicious breakfast here. Kris U said he knew just the place to take me. Of course, he nailed it.   This is my kind of spot. It almost felt kind of divey. Small space, casual, crazy good food, friendly staff. We both ordered the Mexican benedict. For my side, I went half salad, half potatoes. It sounded kind of weird when my server suggested it, but I'm glad she did. Hungry for more than two benedicts? They have an option for a third benny. Genius.   I only have one problem with this place, what do I do now when I'm craving their Mexican bennies and coffee? Kris U, mail me benedicts and breakfast burritos ASAP."}
{"text":"Tried this place twenty for Taco Friday and then again for Sunday brunch and the food was excellent. Felt very authentic and was absolutely delicious. Some of the items were a bit pricey given how much food you're given but the quality was good and it was definitely a nice treat."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great service and yummy Savoury breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito and it was delicious with some hot sauce.  Also ended up buying some art here. Owners friend is a really talented artist!!"}
{"text":"FIVE glorious stars!  Everything on the menu is delicious...the owners and staff are fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved every bite! I had the huevos rancheros, dizzam! Delicious, the beans, the salsa, the guacamole, all together on the baguette makes for a delicious bite. Everything had its own unique flavor, very nicely seasoned. The salad was dressed with the right amount of dressing. The potatoes, fluffy but still with a nice crunch. I'm looking forward to returning and trying the rest of the menu. Seen some drinks listed, 2oz drinks, who doesn't love that!"}
{"text":"I had the Waffles Benedict. It was really good. Flavour was unbelievable. My only complaint was that the waffle could've been a bit crispy on the outside but I guess they were going for the English muffin style texture.   I also had their chorizo tacos, which were really good too. I added a bit of hot sauce to em and they were just perfect.   Ambience is great. Very cool looking space. Overall, good visit if you're in the Lakeshore area looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Very satisfying and delicious breakfast and brunch options here! My husband and I had breakfast here on Saturday morning and it was absolute perfection. I ordered the huevos rancheros and my husband had the Mexican eggs Benedict. Both options were really delicious. Their cappuccinos were decent too. Price points are fairly average and the service was good. Good choice for weekend breakfast and brunch :)"}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience at Huevos Gourmet. I got the Huevos Rancheros, they were a lot of fun. Nice zesty lime, satiating salsa verde, savory refried beans, decent scoop of guac and properly poached eggs. Everything came together nicely. They also had a nice hot sauce on each table. I didn't indulge but the sweet brunch offerings looked and smelled off the chain. I couldn't issue the full 5-stars because of my exquisite Mexican brunch at 'El Pocho', but this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service, coffee, and breakfast empanadas. They play such lovely music too. This is a great spot."}
{"text":"A great little local find. It's a small narrow store front in an old building. It has two rows of 2 or 4 person tables with chairs and bench seats. The selection of all day brunch and lunch items are great. I had their Mexican Benedict. It was fantastic. There are a number of other items on their menu that I look forward to trying. While I was there, a number of local regulars were in as well. The place seems to have a loyal following and that's all I need to know that their quality and pricing is fair. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really good food. I am not a Mexican food expert by any means but food here was really flavourful. Loved their breakfast burrito. Kids enjoyed their French toast (croissant)."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today for the first time, the huevos rancheros was fantastic.  My wife had the chipotle chicken sandwich and she really enjoyed it.  The service was a little slow to start but they definitely made up for it. This place is a welcomed addition to the lakeshore village."}
{"text":"This cozy resto serves up brunch with a Mexican twist, and it's delicious! I had the Mexican Eggs Benedict on gluten free toast (they must have run out of GF buns, as these are an option on the menu). I asked for them to substitute the chorizo for something vegetarian and they obliged. It's nice to go to a restaurant where the GF/veggie and meat options are plentiful so everyone can be happy. :)  I'll definitely be back to sample other offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"No exaggeration - best brunch I've ever had. It must be a well-kept secret, as the only reason I even knew this place existed is because my boyfriend came here a couple months ago and couldn't stop talking about it. The food is phenomenal (especially if you're vegetarian, like me, and the classic sausage/bacon breakfast is something you've grown tired of), the servers are super friendly, and the inside is small, but so cozy! The perfect twist on the classic brunch."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after people telling me so much about this place. Overall, it was a kind of meh. The service was good, pretty standard. Had the huevos with the chorizo add on (this comes out as a scramble and not the whole chorizo) and it was pretty much \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch  Atmosphere: nice and cozy. Love the table facing the outdoor. Nice music.  Service: friendly.   Food: love their brunch.   Price: okay. Same pricing as coras."}
{"text":"Very good brunch. We went with toddler. Food was great. Service was fast and friendly. Recommend the hue is gourmet."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen, Forget the over-priced high end Mexican restaurants closer to the core.  For the best Mexican food in all of GTA come to Huevos Gourmet in Etobicoke.  The fish tacos were light, crispy and full of flavour.  Nachos are range and crunchy with gooey cheese.  Fantastic.  An off menu item that I recommend, ask for the beans on the side.  To die for"}
{"text":"good morning...GOOD morning!  well, if more mornings were done at this wonderful, establishment, everyday would be a good day.  i don't have a bad thing to say about this place, the food is amazing and flavorful, the actual sitting area is small and intimate, and the staff are super nice, eager to help.  very well priced, considering the flavors that come with the items on the menu, EVERYTHING looks to good to try on the first go around.  defiantly end the meal with the churros...very well balanced and not heavy on the sugar.  will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was honestly better than I expected. It's fairly small inside and I went with my family of 5 so we had to wait a little bit to be seated but the employees kindly asked a table of 2 who were sitting at a table for 4 to change seats so we could sit there. I ordered the regular eggs benny and my step dad got the Mexican eggs benny. We swapped one so we could try them both and I have to say if you consider getting eggs benny from here, just get the Mexican one. It's so good. The regular one is good as well but the Mexican one is seriously delicious. They also make some really nice drinks and the kids got waffles with fruits. Those were delicious as well. They begged us to order another one for them. Over all, this is a great new find for me and I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Very good food, it's always a good sign when Mexican actually have breakfast there as well.  Service was perfect, good staff. Cool vibe"}
