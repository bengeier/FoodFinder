{"text":"The place is awesome, the service is unbelievable, thanks to the management for a job well done. 

I only give 4 stars because it is too impossible to be perfect. The food is great except for some that I don't like. The ambience is perfect for everyone except if you have kids because it is a little too loud but I don't discredit them for that. The crablet is my favorite, the rolls, and the fish are beyond expectation.

I did take out orders and by the way, I have to pick it up because they don't do delivery. I can't believe how fast they are in preparing my orders especially I did it on holidays. Good job guys and I would definitely recommend you to all of my friends to get the chance to know how impeccable the service and  how mouth watering are the foods. 

The only problem here is the parking. It is very limited as it is located along the street. I am always lucky to get one everytime I visited this place."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!  This is my new favourite Japanese Restaurant!  The service was excellent, the food was fresh and terrific and the ambiance/decor is chic!  Prices were fair and I will definitely return to this restaurant as there were so many great sounding items on the menu (many unique combinations).  I would highly recommend the crunchy soup- it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food may be overpriced here but I enjoy my options and variety. I am often annoyed when I can't get a bigger table especially if it stays empty for the remainder of my meal. I requested a window seat however was declined because it was a 4 person table. Meanwhile there are other pairs sitting there as well. Instead I got a round booth in the back with dirty cracked seats. This place needs to replace their leather cushions. 

I had a selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and a spider roll. My favourite was probably the sunonomo salad (with seaweed) but on the pricer side for $7 ...

I would probably recommend other sushi restaurants if you're looking for quality

Hope this helps!

{"text":"Dining here is always a positive experience. Decor is modern-looking. Rolls are on the smaller side but the quality of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ive ever had.......i got very sick eating here.......horrible staff....very rude and seam racist.......but back to the food...the rice was still jard and under cooked and im pretty sure the sushi was rotten! Do not come here please for your own sake!"}
{"text":"This place distinguishes itself from the many Japanese restaurants in the area by having a large, open space and understated dark colours as decor.  The food was also surprisingly good, and portions are unusually generous:  The salmon sashimi lunch actually has enough pieces to not leave you still hungry yet doesn't cost an arm and a leg, the bento box was varied and tasted good, and when I tried the kalbi dinner, the plate was stacked with so many large pieces that it puts to shame most other kalbi entrees I've tried.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Overall I would give this place a 4 star because I have eaten here many times and love the food, service and atmosphere. They lost one star because the last time I came the waitress accidentally brought my boyfriend the wrong beer. He let her know and she apologized and offered a replacement but he didn't mind drinking it. And that same night as my boyfriend was drinking his beer he found a chip on the lip of his cup which he was drinking out of the whole night, he wasn't angry just annoyed. But once again he brought it to her attention, she apologized profusely and replaced his glass immediately with a fresh beer. 

It's unfortunate that it happened but they took the correct actions to make the experience better for us. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, but pricy for the type of sushi. I think you would only be paying for the environment of being on Yonge and having televisions to watch when games are on. I'd say that it's more of an adult dinner location, just because when they are packed, they only can offer high table seating and because it is relatively loud."}
{"text":"been here a handful of times now. Atmosphere can't be beat. Great place to go with friends and do a boozy dinner. My problem is I find them to be a little snobby, the sushi sucks (does not taste fresh seaweed always like rubber) and they are a little over priced on  both drinks and food.  When its my boyfriend and I on our own we choose sushi one across the street every time because the food is better and its cheaper but as I said cool place to go with friends and their cooked food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill.  Sashimi was not fresh and all the other foods tasted old and salty.  Bottom line: not returning anymore."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I have gone to this restaurant . The service and food are top notch. The dinner bento and sashimi  is  unbelievable and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we stopped at this place after we already had dinner just for some drinks. We ended up eating a bunch of rolls anyways because they were soo good. 

The atmosphere was awesome and the servers were great. We had agedashi tofu (crispy tofu in teriyaki sauce), electric banana (which was weird at first but actually quite tasty), beautiful roll (scallop, avocado, smoked salmon), yam tempura. It was ALL amazing! 

I'll definitely be going back for a full dinner/meal. Not only is the food super tasty, but they have great drinks too! 

I had the white wine saki sangria, the rose saki sangria, and the plum wine. They were all well presented and very flavorful. 

Prices were more expensive than the regular sushi places but overall fairly reasonable. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Sushi Moto is one of my goto sushi places when in uptown Toronto.  Some people say it's a bit pricey for the quality and that might be a bit true as sashimi prices are slightly higher on average.  Likely to cover expensive rent for this neighbourhood and the nice upscale casual ambience 

However Sushi Moto really excels for three main reasons:

1.  No other sushi place is open as late as them... 11pm last order on weeknights and 1am are n weekends!

2. Sushi quality and freshness is always high because of the constant turnover of sashimi due to it always being busy

3. The ambience is unlike most other sushi restaurants... upscale casual but with a lounge/bar type feel.  Music playing in background, lots of TVs playing sports, and a very large alcohol menu of liquor beer and wine.  It actually caters to groups, couples, dates and singles.

It's always consistent and good customer service, quick delivery speed and friendly greetings are the norm.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks absolutely amazing, classy decor, trendy vibe and really friendly and helpful staff. 

Now onto the food, I don't know why but it feels like I've been lied to all my life and the sushi we had at sushi moto is what it should have been all along; the miso soup was great and the beef teriyaki was tender and full of flavour. The tempura vegetables was amazing, fresh and full of flavour. The salad was good but the dressing with a hint of garlic was a hit!

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The place looks really modern and chic at first glance, but when we actually went to a booth to sit down, the seats were cracked and the table was oily...

The complimentary noodle in broth was really salty.

We ordered some maki. They all tasted very shallow...Everything just tastes OK. 
They are presented well though, so if you are into presentation and appearance of your food, you can appreciate that."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a classy feel about it, the food is excellent (extensive selection of quality maki) and service is good. It's a bit on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Some of my favourites are the dynamite maki and lychee martini."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Sushi Moto for years. The food is outstanding. Every piece of maki is a flavour explosion. The service is super friendly and atmosphere is vibrant, especially at night. Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"I think I'd give a 4.5 stars if I could. Is it perfect, not, but close to given the prices. We've been here four times and so far everything has been very good. I'd wish green tea would be hotter and there wouldn't be a TV screen visible from no matter where you sit, but other than that, the service so far has been fast and attentive, no plastic plates or cups, the fish is very fresh, rolls are of good size and nicely presented. We even got the left overs packed in a the tray in a pretty way - it was a nice surprise to open it at home."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, and more importantly, delicious food. I can't recommend Sushi Moto enough."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this sushi place. Good portion for the price, wide variety of options. Delicious food and yummy Mochi desserts! I will be going again and again anytime I crave Japanese food. It's quite spacious a variety of seating is available and extremely efficient staff! One time they forgot the water and I had to ask someone else so that's why I give it 4/5 but other than that good place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets four starts. Sushi is mediocre-mushy and bland. Chicken teriyaki is dry and cold.
One good thing is the service."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Everything we've had there has been delicious. You can taste the freshness on the fish. A bit pricey compared to other options in the neighbourhood, but totally worth it. Make sure you try the avocado salad, tempura ice-cream and \"saketinis\"."}
{"text":"Probably a mistake to order a la carte sushi/sashimi in an non authentic sushi restaurant. Food is Ten-Ichi all you eat quality, very disappointed. End up spending $80 for 2ppl. Will never return."}
{"text":"Amazing but expensive sushi. Must try the sushi pizza, very unique taste. The bento boxes are much more reasonably priced and provide a nice variety of flavors. Good service and friendly staff with a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"When i entered this place i was amazed that there was such a big restaurant hidden just close to my home and i had never tried it. The atmosphere seemed nice, dimly lit and fairly crowded for a Friday night. The menu was a little confusing but with the help of our server we could find what we wanted. I ordered the pink lady maki. It had cooked salmon and pink wraps. It looked and tasted good but kept falling apart making it almost impossible to pick up. I decided to share my experience with the server, what I heard was :\"these rolls tend to get soggy after a while\" i replied that it was the same from the beginning, he said he would talk to his manager to see what he could do. He came back with the same answer and told me there was nothing he could do about it. I wasn't happy neither with my food nor with the way i was served."}
{"text":"This is a very nice sushi restaurant. I've been there a few times and have never been disappointed. I particularly like their lobster sushi. Their presentations are pretty nice too. The only thing which doesn't fit, is having a few TVs in the restaurant. After all, this is not a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sat night with friends. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite places for sushi. Firstly the atmosphere is great for a night out. The interior is modern, they play kind of clubby music... Not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation with your table but it's there in the background....so fun for a bite and drinks... Joe the manager is great and makes sure everything is up to par. My friend and I split a small sushi and sashimi combo boat.... The fish is fresh and high quality.... Many places I have been to I don't mind eating the sashimi (ichiban, takara bune) but here you really enjoy the salmon tuna and hamachi...if you go to ayce sushi places and think ur eating good sushi you are definitely not.... This place is miles above any ayce. My girlfriend had the kalbi dinner bento box and it was massive.... Tempura was crisp and not oily... The kalbi was nice and tender.. After we ate we hung around and had some shots before going downtown.... Over all a really fun night. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Yonge & Sheppard neighborhood. Nice, modern decor, creative presentation. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great date place! Especially loved the sashimi and the handrolls are just bomb, then again, I do love me any type of sushi and its the closest one to my house so that's a definite plus."}
{"text":"The shushi portion on the rice was paper thin , and my seaweed salad had hair in it !!!
We did tell our server and got a visit from the manager , 
He was rude and did not look very anderstanding . He did not offer anything and made us feel that some how it is our fault .we have decided to live . 
We used to dine there often . 
Never again !! Please stay away ."}
{"text":"Reallly good food and cocktails priced very reasonablly. Cozy atmosphere and clean place. staff was really quick and helpful with the services"}
{"text":"It is the best Japanese restaurant I have ever tried in Toronto.... I go there often. The food is amazing, the place is clean and the staff is always polite."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Friday night.  We waited over an hour because of a mixup by the hostess.  We kept watching people who came in after us get seated.  We had to keep asking and eventually they noted their error and seated us.  

No apology whatsoever!

After all that, the waiter got our order wrong and we had to wait even longer for our food.

When the food came, it was nothing special.

Service was unprofessional and experience was terrible.

Many other Japanese places in the area and around the city to try.

If I could rate zero stars I would.  Will never be back at Sushi Moto again!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good and presentation is pretty. Service was excellent. The atmosphere and decor here is really nice and modern. It's great for couples and families too. I feel it's a little overpriced compared to other sushi places but you do get superior service. We ordered the Matsu sushi combo and it had salmon, snapper, tuna nigiri and a California and salmon roll."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they are opened late, and the fishes here are super fresh. Every time I come here I always make sure I order their spicy salmon salad, one of my fav dishes here. Must try !! My friends and I ordered the combo with sashimi and sushis a couple of times and the presentation is beautiful (definitely snap chat worthy) lol I also love the Kalbi here ! Not to sound fat but I love this place a lot because I'm a big fan of green tea ice cream and the portion that comes when you order one is pretty big, unlike most sushi restaurants, so that made me really happy."}
{"text":"incredible maki rolls
very different from typical sushi experience"}
{"text":"Modern decor. Large beautiful bar surrounded by TV which was great for sports. Service is prompt. Sushi is par for price. Various rows are below par with too little rice that is too dry at times. Worst aspect of this place is the dry and stale wasabi. It hard to have your mediocre sushi with worse wasabi."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in all of Toronto and I being from Vancouver like to consider myself a sushi snob. I haven't been there  in months but I feel this restaurant doesn't get the recognition it deserves. 
All of the staff are \"white washed\" with great service. Lots of comped food. Try the Beef Kalbi appetizer. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Moto is the place to go for Sushi if you live uptown. Definitely try the Philadelphia and green dragon rolls. Salmon sashimi is the best. Shrimp tempura is also a must. You won't find better Philadelphia rolls elsewhere.  Sometimes music is too loud. The service is not consistently great..every once in a while you get a waiter whose too busy for you.."}
{"text":"We were here with a large group for a birthday and our waitress was Yoon Hee, I have to say, she was a phenomenal waitress, not only was she top notch at her job, her overall positive attitude and enthusiasm was really refreshing. I mean I've had good service in other restaurants, but she seemed to really enjoy what she was doing and so her service to us was really exceptional. 

That aside, for the food, I had the bulgogi dinner and karaage chicken. To be honest, I felt the bulgogi was slightly underseasoned and the karaage wasn't anything special. I didn't try the sushi, but I heard it tasted really good and fresh from my friends. For dessert, I had the green tea mochi and black sesame ice cream, I enjoyed the mochi but loved the black sesame ice cream. 

My 5 stars definitely went toward the service, but I would definitely come back to try the sushi!"}
{"text":"One of the most expensive sushi places in the area. The food is good but nowhere good enough for what they charge. 

The atmosphere is great, with an abundance of tv's and great decor. It kind of feels like a bar at night. Unfortunately it's primarily a restaurant that fails at its main purpose. Very pricey, small portions, and only adequate food. 

Recomended for drinks only."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in the GTA. 

The atmosphere is amazing. The food selection is varied, unique, and everything tastes great. Do order the Fire and Kamakazi roles, they are to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I made my account just so I could review this place.

The service was unbelievable! First off, I got a chicken teryiaki bento box but I wanted to substitute some stuff inside it and they did that (it came with a california roll but I wanted a green dragon). Our drinks were refilled every couple of minutes (we drank a lot of tea). We were served complimentary appetizers (some type of soup). And then, when we were leaving, they gave us tea to go because it was so cold outside. Awesome!! And the manager was always walking around, keeping a watchful eye. The server was very friendly too. It was great.

Also, the food was splendid. Everything tasted incredibly fresh (even on a Sunday), and the presentation was phenomenal. The rolls looked neat and tidy. Probably the best presentation I've seen yet for sushi. Very impressed!

Great experience and convenient location. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for a company luch and I can say the food was pretty good and the service was actually very good.

Thanks"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for Japanese food foe the past 3 years. The food has always been good, the presentation on point, and the decor and service has always been good. Until now. I took my son there for some sushi and teriyaki. My son had a sushi dinner combo, and I decided to splurge and go the the beef teriyaki bento box, which is made of a sirloin beef steak. The sushi plate my son received looked like the sushi chef just threw it on the plate with some garnishes. Worst presentation ever. And my bento box? My sirloin beef wasnt even warm. Almost $29 for this box, and I got a cold steak, some flavorless California rolls, and one shrimp tempura that tasted like rubber. I felt like I was at a different restaurant. I don't know what changed, but to top it off, our waiter, who was nice, perhaps could use some deodorant. I have never been so disappointed in my experience at a restaurant as I have at Sushi Moto. There are numerous mediocre restaurants in the Yonge and Sheppard area, and I'm sad to say that Sushi Moto can be added as an over priced sushi restaurant with less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. Great customer service. Great interior. Wonderful sushi quality and I love their complimentary noodle crunch soup.
Tattaki attack sushi roll is to dye for."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this restaurant. The sushi is quite good. Not a bad place for a decent night out. Prompt service. The tempura and sashimi are delicious. 

The menu is HUGE. There are tons of options and choices. It will take you a while to decide what to get! Lots of special rolls and options. Thumbs up for variety. I would reccommend this restaurant -- especially to a larger group with varying tastes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice, the servers really attentive. I did not find the sushi outstanding in comparison to other places I've been. The seaweed salad was standard."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice from inside and comfortable seating.  We ordered a dynamite roll,  spicy salmon and crazy roll I think ( the one with spicy scallop)  Rolls were all fresh and tasted good.  For the price,  I think the size of the rolls was a bit on the smaller size.  We also tried the salmon teriyaki which was good.  The complimentary miso soup is also good ( size should be a little bigger)  they don't offer complimentary green tea( like many places do) which for me is a turn off. Specially considering the price they charge.  Each if these rills was about $12.95 each."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place in my neighbourhood. Everything is always fresh and amazing with consistent quality - I've never once put a piece of sashimi in my mouth that tasted even the slightest bit \"off\" here.  So, so good!

For sashimi lovers, I highly recommend the chirashi. It costs less than some other sashimi combos but offers the same amount of fish, if not more (I've never been able to finish the whole meal) - and the variety of sashimi included is outstanding!"}
{"text":"very fresh sashimi.
I love their soup before meal. It has noodles in it and won't make you too full.
It is a very big place. 
Kinda expensive."}
{"text":"excellent sushi and maki, however the time to get the food served was a little bit too long, while the shop wasn't very busy yet at the time we visited. We ordered a sashimi sushi dinner set, and also a specialty maki (california roll with spicy salmon on top), very very tasty! nice atmosphere, especially we got the booth seats

they had a full alcohol bar. long list of alcohol and wine, but we didn't order any of those this time.

price was a little bit too pricy, but the quality of food worths it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now (for both lunch and dinner).  My absolute favourite is the Lobster Roll (tempura lobster with sweet mayo, like a Dynamite Roll on steroids).  It's the bomb!

Service is always friendly, the waitresses are really sweet.  Ambience is cool, they managed to successfully transform it from the previous run down pub to an upscale sushi bar.  They also have fun sushi roll names, so bring a hot date to try the \"Erotica\" Roll...

My only complaint (since I am a bit of a cheapie) is that this place is expensive at night!  Entrees and stuff range into the plus $20s.  The food is good, but not remarkable...you can easily get the same quality of food elsewhere for less.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Service was good. The sashimi we ordered was fresh and plated nicely. The sushi rice we ordered on the side was a bit over-seasoned, but cooked well. The avocado salad is very large, enough for 2 to share. Liked the fact that they serve a small portion of noodle soup (no charge) while you're waiting for your appetizers & meal -- nice touch. We would go back."}
{"text":"The food hits the spot when you're craving some good sushi. There are so many varieties you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Spacious place, nice design. I managed to keep my bill under $15 and have a descent mix of sushi rolls and sashimi. You should expect no less $25 if you wanna have good food and  drink.

Worth the try."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service, as well as delicious fresh sushi! We ordered an assortment of maki and nigiri which was all fantastic. The plates had beautiful presentation, and the restaurant has a great ambience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just went here on a Friday evening and it was pretty packed. We walked in and was presented with a waitress to show us to our table. Then all of a sudden there were 3-4 waitresses and not sure who was taking care of us. Food was mediocre, kind of looked fancy, but it was not worth the price tag after 30 minutes of waiting for the first dish. There are much better places on Springgarden Ave. for better bang for your buck. Great atmosphere for friends to have some brew or sake, but it will be a while before I come back again."}
{"text":"Seemed like one of the best sushi places in the area but turns out that it's NOT! Went in for a take out order and was extremely disappointed when opened the boxes at home. Two miso soups, two special maki and plate of sashimi cost me $41. The soups were in 1 cup size styrofoam containers and were not even 3/4 filed. The special maki rolls were just very small comparing with other great places that I've been to. Same story about with the sashimi pieces. The tiniest slices I've even had in my life! Unbelievable! I asked for extra soy sauce and they gave us 4 packets. Chop sticks were of such bad quality that we had to use forks! We had to make sandwiches at home after this disappointing sushi dinner!! 
I would give them ZERO STARS if it was possible. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, the salmon sushi is very fresh and melts in your mouth.  Price is moderate, you cant expect something of this quality to be cheap.  They give you this little bowl of noodles, it's really cool and tasty."}
{"text":"Hi all,

I recently had the pleasure of visiting this newly opened venue. I'll break it down into a few key points to keep it flowing:

1. Drinks - First and foremost, drinks are refreshing, plentiful, and they've got something for everyone.  I came with a few friends so we got to try a variety of things from martinis to soju/sake bottles and more. 4 out of 5, the price is a bit touch and go.

2. Food - Fresh, Tasty, and Affordable. Nothing more needs to be said. 5 out of 5.

3. Service - Friendly, fast, and funny. More than one server catered to us and the attitude was more than pleasant. Also, the bartender, particularly the girl in black, dealt with a huge influx of orders with stellar coolness and efficiency. She must be the bar manager.  5 out of 5.

4. Atmosphere - Asian minimalist but with a hint of a traditional Japanese Sushi bar. I know this is a personal preference, but I like it. 5 out of 5.

Will be back often, hope to see you around!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during this weekend. Was immediate seated and welcomed by a friendly hello from the chefs.
This place is actually quite a good bar,  but it is also a nice place to get some sushi."}
{"text":"First thing I really want to say about Sushi Moto before I say anything else is...the staff!!

Hands down the nicest staff in any restaurant I have been too. Every time I have been here, they have been attentive, courteous, and knowlegeable. The managers were always very focused running around the place and they really kept on top of things. This is why the place runs so smooth!

Food is amazing...I highly recommend the seadfood platter if you want some amazing (and incredibly fresh!) seafood!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: this place is expensive but good. I went here with a friend, and ordered the small sushi set which was $30 (admittedly it was also 27 pieces - not so small). The food was fresh, and there were some neat extras. Specifically I substituted the California roll in the set for a Takato Attack, which was recommended on other Yelp reviews and, yup, I concur with the rest. It is a scallop based roll with fish on too, and they must put some flame to the roll before serving not because there is a smokiness to it that is quite delicious.

I would add that this dinner came with some kind of small bowl of noodle soup but no miso soup and green salad typically seen at sushi places. A small matter and not taken into account in my review."}
{"text":"Sushi Moto never fails to please us. The food is very consistent - consistently great!
My favourite dynamite roll is always perfectly done, sushi is always fresh, the hae-dup-bap is awesome. Our friend had Chicken Domburi and loved it.
The stuff is very professional and friendly. 
Ambiance is modern and clean. The place is nicely decorated.
It's a hike for us from Richmond Hill, but we visit every time we are in the area.
Highly recommend for those of you who are not an \"all you can eat\" lovers."}
{"text":"Great sushi . Fresh. And a nice atmosphere. The rolls are great. Nice presentation. Good service (only thing is some of the girls don't speak English that well)."}
{"text":"THE BEST SUSHI HANDS DOWN!!! This place is amazing the sushi is always fresh and it's ALWAYS packed with people. Of course at a Sushi Restaurant that is always a good sign if your waiting for a table.... The atmosphere is trendy and so is the crowd...AMAZING!!! A++++++"}
{"text":"Came here with two buddies who remembered this place foe its snickers candy bar tempura...!

We ordered four rolls and the small sashimi. The sashimi was OK but the rolls were pretty awesome. Yum! Good atmosphere and full but not packed for a last minute Saturday evening walk in!

The twix candy bar tempura as dessert was good but Mara bar may have been better. Overall good experience. Woah I'm stuffed."}
{"text":"Over priced average food. Pretty sure people just go because it looks swank."}
{"text":"The place looks real nice, we had a great time. One of the best places for dates, affordable prices and good service. Great location and good parking spots."}
{"text":"Spacious place. Okay sushi. On the pricier side for the quality."}
{"text":"We ordered sashimi platter for 2 ppl and the quality is not bad at all for 50 bucks. Shld also try their tuna tartare. Yum."}
{"text":"I agree that Sushi Moto is pricier than other Sushi places in the area, but their fish is also the freshest! 

The interior is spacious. Servers have tons of room to move around, and they all seem to be very young and move at lightning speed! 

All that good stuff said, I don't believe the food is worth it. $18.95 for Chirashi that has so little sashimi variety - where's my egg and fish roe?! My brother ordered the Sashimi dinner for $19.95 and it included 18 pieces of sashimi of which 8 pieces were salmon. He had even less variety of fish and paid an extra dollar. The sashimi is indeed fresh, but I'm not sure what I'm paying extra for.. The loud atmosphere? 

Overall, this place is a valid option to come for drinks with a friend as they do have an extensive sake and wine menu. I may try some of the cheaper Korean items in the menu next time."}
{"text":"Classy sushi spot perfect for a night out when you're looking for a more laid-back and chill atmosphere! The private and spacious seats, low music punctuated occasionally by warm greetings from the staff, combined with superb service and food makes this one of my favourite Japanese restaurants to visit with friends. :)

From the moment of walking in, all of the waitresses were friendly and attentive, and the place was clearly not in need of extra staff. Requests were always answered promptly, whether it be for dishes to be cleared, more drinks, or the bill. The food (which I will get to shortly) was so good and I felt so comfortable that we spent about 2 to 3 hours sitting there, and not once were we reminded of the time. In fact even as they were bringing the card machine they asked if we needed more tea. Heh.

The food itself was of course excellent as well. Perhaps on the more expensive side compared to other restaurants in the area, but I really can't complain about the quality OR quantity. I feel like the pictures don't quite do the portions justice, but the bowl of hae-dup-bap (before adding rice) was literally the size of my head. At first I was under the impression that it was mostly salad (i.e., lettuce), but then I kept digging up more sashimi underneath...with respect to freshness and taste - I savoured every bite.

Will be back to try some of their exotic sounding rolls! ;)"}
{"text":"Really great sushi with a unique quality I can't place, but that makes it distinct from other sushi I've had. The Cowboy roll was great. I also love the spicy salmon roll and spicy California roll. Both have the perfect amount of heat. The prices are good and they do take out."}
{"text":"although this place was suggested by my cousin (because his friend owns the place), i was unimpressed by their sushi/sashimi. it wasn't fresh! 

yes, the place is nice, trendy and huge, but i wouldn't go here for their sushi."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's hands down my all time favourite sushi restaurant. I came here 3 times in total now and I have been beyond pleased every visit.

The yummy yam roll and tataki attack roll are my favourites. The yam roll is the best I've ever had and it's at such a great price too! The tataki attack roll is a bit fishy (my friend isn't a big fan because she can't stand fishy tastes so just a heads up) but it feels like it melts in your mouth as you chew, so delicious! 

They offer a complimentary bowl of noodles. It's really small but super yummy! I believe it's a fish broth (not 100% sure, I apologize if I'm wrong) with some noodles and green onion/seaweed garnish. The first time I went with friends they even gave as an order of edamame beans on the house to apologize for making us wait for seats. This was such a kind gesture as we didn't make a reservation and only waited for around 10 minutes max. The customer service is A+++ no matter how busy it gets (which can be VERY busy so make reservations when you can!)."}
{"text":"First impression of the place was great~ the interior decoration looked nice and the sushi bar tied everything together. The customer service was great too! The waitress was quick to serve us and the food came really quickly! I LOVED the chirashi bowl, it was so good! Also we ordered a set and it was way too much for just two people but we enjoyed it nonetheless. But, my boyfriend said there was a bit too much rice on the rolls... But i didn't really think so. :')The mushroom appetizer was great and the things we ordered came with crunchy noodle soups, miso soup and a salad. Overall, it was a great place and we left super full! REALLY recommend the chirashi bowr! The prices were really decent too."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi selection, at very reasonable prices!  I was really excited by the many options on the menu, and when my order arrived I was blown away!  Wow!  Soooo good!  
We had a private room at the back of the restaurant, which was a really nice touch, and were still checked in on very regularly by the waitresses to fill up our water glasses, etc. 
Wonderful service and excellent food!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the greatest sushi spot within the GTA. We come here regularly and always have our large celebrations (birthdays) here and the staff is always great, and friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious. The sashimi especially is very fresh and cut perfectly. I would recommend anything on the menu. They are also open late so it's a great choice for a late night snack. Definitely a must try! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good service, however food was not that good. I went there because of high reviews, yet I was so disappointed. Small portion, not tasty,..
Not recommanded"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest sushi restaurant, but definitely worth it. The food is always super fresh. They have some creative rolls that are really good. The atmosphere is fancy and the service is friendly and efficient. Deep fried tempura mars bar with ice cream makes a great finish to the meal. 
Maybe not so affordable for an everyday takeout, but a great place for a good dinner out or for drinks with friends after dinner."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking forward to it based on all the reviews but it could partly be my fault. 

We went on a Sunday (I've heard sushi shouldn't be eaten on a sunday) and we didn't do the best job ordering food. Two out of the three appetizers turned out to be fried. We called for dumplings but they came fried and I wanted to try the beef enoki which is fried too but not that great tasting.

We also ordered three rolls, Spicy Killer (i think?) which Mr. H and I assumed was shrimp tempura on the inside but the entire roll was deep fried (makes me think the menu is very clear). We also had the French Kiss and Tataki Roll, both of which were really good. We tried the Albacore Sushi and Smoked Salmon, they were too dry for my taste and didn't taste very fresh. 

PS: Both Mr. H and I had an upset stomach afterwards.

PPS: My search for above average sushi in Toronto continues."}
{"text":"I've been severely ill for the last two weeks, whatever I ate it was sure to be regurgitated back up...so why I picked fish I don't know. 

I went on a Thursday night with no reservations and there were no tables available, what is this place, the Ritz?  
I was so much under the weather I didn't notice a thing until my first shot of wasabi.  Sushi Moto is an Asian sportsbar--just like Crazy Wingz--only they served sushi.  I asked the waitress what types of tea they had.
\"Green tea, that's the only type,\" she replied.
I'll have that type then...everybody laughed at my completely meaningless and unfunny joke, so I laughed back just to fit in.  This was annoying.
It wasn't until she returned with my tea did I realise how freaking cute my waitress was.  Then I noticed that all of the waitresses here were wearing booty shorts, in December.  Oh...it was THAT kinda sports bar.  I'm the last person to pay attention to the Women in these type of establishments, but my waitress was so super cute.  I tried to sound cool, but my sick had me sounding like rusted pipe.

I went through the menu, there were no photos.  I don't care if I've been to a million sushi restaurants or the same sushi restaurant a million times, a sushi restaurant needs to have photographs on the menu!  This should be LAW!
I was amazed by the prices here, they were charging twenty bucks and over for bento boxes, and ten bucks for maki rolls.  It's like Milestones decided to serve sushi but kept all their pretentious prices.  How much were these booty shorts running them??  Was there a Saki room?
We ordered about eighty bucks worth of food, and it wasn't worth it.  Spider roll was novice, the sashimi was fresh but so what?  I had sea urchin just once, and I don't remember it tasting so disgusting.  It literally tasted like I was eating diarrhea.  The worst part was...I didn't know whether the foul taste meant it was spoiled or fresh.

The décor is all wrong for a Japanese restaurant, it should be a Moxie's or something along those lines.  I've always believed that sex and food were a bad mix.  They serve those giant boat plated platters here, but the environment was too trendy for this kind of food.  The only reason I would go back is to get the number of that gorgeous waitress.  But it might take awhile for the foul taste of dead sea urchin to completely be out of my mouth.


SushiMOTO huh?  Well...poor reception if you ask me."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here was quite good!
Service is OK.
Great open kitchen decor and ambience in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Totally brilliant -we tried salmon, toro, albacore tuna and fluke as well as several rolls.  The fish was absolutely perfect -- it tasted like it may have been swimming several hours back:) The service was excellent - the server volunteered to change the existing roll components to what he inferred we would like- which is unusual to say the least.  AND they have mochi ice cream which is an absolutele rarity in Toronto.  It is picey but SO worth it!"}
{"text":"A gem in the area, that's for sure! Came here for lunch today and really enjoyed the food. The restaurant is very classy looking with plenty of booths and tables- it gets packed very quickly at lunch so come a little before noon. The only downside is the location- parking is hard to find unless you park on the street or a few blocks away.

We ordered the sashimi platter which comes with 10 assorted sashimi. All were of excellent quality and were decent cuts. The sushi maki was also really good.

The service here is fantastic! I told the server that I was allergic to avocado and she made sure that it was taken out of any dish we ordered. I really appreciated that!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after seeing good reviews, but Sushi Moto failed to impress me. Despite the beautiful presentation, the quality of the food served was not much better than what you get at all-you-can-eat places. I ordered fried oysters and chicken katsu appetizers, both were excessively greasy and tasteless. The sashimi sushi maki combo included some big pieces of sashimi, but the rolls (spicy salmon & spicy tuna) were just disgusting. I sat by the sushi bar, and I noticed that there is a huge plate of spicy salmon and tuna rolls just sitting there, god knows how many hours ago they were made. The fish was not fresh and the crunch was soggy (why even include crunch if you are just going to premake these rolls hours ago, the crunch just makes it taste greasy and adds a bunch of calories). What's even worse is that plates of food sit for up to 20 minutes by the sushi bar before a waitress would come pick it up. Plates kept piling and piling and none of the staff can be bothered to serve them. Having identified a plate as mine, I had to ask the waitress to bring it to me. Sushi is supposed to be consumed as soon as it is prepared, and the fact that they allow raw fish to sit in room temperture for so long just shows how little they care about their food and their customers. I also had a beautiful roll, which had spicy salmon roll (premade many many hours ago) as a base so that was automatically bad. Crazy roll and sun set action roll tasted alright but were very greasy (menu said the latter includes cucumber but it did not). Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant, it's just another sushi place where the chefs could care less about the quality of the food, but it is still able to stay profitable due to inexperienced sushi eaters."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as I was craving fresh sushi!

The inside is beautiful, and we were seated right away. It was just my coworker and I.  

We asked for popular items that we could order and the server was awesome with describing everything and very honest with his recommendation.  

We asked what his recommendation was in terms of portions and what we should order. We took his advice but I found it to be too much food. 

My sushi was delicious! The fish on top was soft and well cooked."}
{"text":"Okay the only reason this place got a 3/5 was because the service was so bad. At the beginning it was great but towards the end, the waiters and the owner himself were kicking us out! Me and my friend were not even ready to leave while I went to the washroom the owner and waiter was telling my friend to get out of here, and let me tell you we stayed for 30 min max. I understand that maybe you have to kick us out when you have a line at the door and I'm not a terrible person, I usually eat and go, but there wasn't! The place had PLENTY of space for costumers and their was no line! Yes, I understand that your place serves great food, and i'm willing to pay even though your more expensive then other sushi places. However, don't kick people out, when I came back up the stairs from the washroom my friend was waiting for me at the door and I asked what happened and she tells me how the guy was saying \"nice words\" to kick us out. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"The sushi here is super fresh and reasonably priced for the quality. Highly recommend the chirashi don. I think I just found my new favorite sushi place in the yonge/Sheppard area!!"}
{"text":"I hate the fact that as soon as i finished the meal, the first waitress just gave me the fold without me asking for the bill and the second waitress came in half a minute and asking \"credit card?\" The food is okay but the price is not cheap, and they wouldn't even let the customer sit for a little longer? As a waiter I know this is rude to the customer and this is something I absolutely hate and so do a lot of my friends, whom haven't been waiters at all in their lives."}
{"text":"It was bad food, sushi was not fresh, very slow service,totally overpriced
Went there for the reviews and was totally disappointed 
We ordered special maki roles that were not fresh and were too small for their price
The waitress was so ignorant that after waiting for so long we had to go to the front to pay our bill"}
{"text":"Excellent selection with a nice presentation. Very tasty food and pretty good atmosphere."}
{"text":"wow this place is delicious!

I had the tataki attacki roll, sashimi dinner plate, dynamite roll, kamikaze roll, lots of drinks.

5/5 the food quality is outstanding, fresh, delicious, just great tasting. 
4/5 service is also quite good, except the weird man at the door is some times rude.. 
5/5 consistency is super, i have been here a few times with similarly good experiences
3/5 prices are high, not quite sky high though .. but I guess this place deserves it, despite the costco seaweed salad being like 7$!!!!!
5/5 decor is quite nice, clean, stylish, and just a great place to be

not much downside going here, just have to save up before you can afford it though"}
{"text":"A friend and I arrived at 8:45pm. All seats were taken, so we had a seat at the bar. The host was very accomodating. He found us a booth in just 10 minutes. The female servers are so hot! We had some sake and tea before our meal. The waiter was prompt and friendly. I told him we wanted to drink a little before eating. He was cool and let us enjoy the drinks before asking for our order.
  We ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings. Very good. Another appetizer we ordered was the meat and aparagus rolls. Delicious. For the main course we had the Maki number #1. A little expensive, especially with all the all u can eat sushi bars around. Some of the chicken maki broke apart. The server forgot to bring my soya bowl. 
  Very comfortable and private booth. Cool and modern atmosphere. Stayed late with no pressure to finish eating at all."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in all of Toronto and I originally being from Vancouver like to consider myself a sushi snob. I haven't been there in months but I feel this restaurant doesnt get the recognition it deserves.
All of the staff are \"white washed\" with great service. Lots of comped food. it is open late. Try the beef kalbi appetizer...amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The freshest sushi around this area, and there's a lot of sushi places around Yonge&Shepard. They're absolutely PACKED for lunch though. The white tuna was delicious."}
{"text":"Been trying to come to Sushi Moto since last year but everytime I came the wait was crazy.  Was in the area and was surprised it was dead on Sat evening so 3rd time is a charm.  Decor is posh and hip, first thing I noticed is that they have a lot of staff from waitress to staff behind sushi bar.  Sushi Moto is huge with nice booth seating for a more intimate environment.  

Ordered one of the medium boats and was impressed with the sushi quality and variety.  Only thing we didn't like is the maki that came with the boat.  Wasn't a big fan of deep fried maki with cream cheese.   They had so many servers that they came to our table so many times asking us if everything was okay.   At least they refilled our water/tea fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place. The icecream flavour black sesame was pretty interesting. The server was very friendly and gave great suggestions. It was my parents first Sushi experience and they both loved it. Usually people don't like sushi for the first time but even though that my parents loved it. I am glad and happy to have found this place. You are looking for around $100-150 for proper eating for 4 people. If you like to over eat or a ayce type of person then this place will cost you a lot. But if you want to eat properly and eat best sushi then this place is for you. Very good ambience and music. Will definitely come back. Only suggestion to restaurant to lower prices a bit so they attract more people"}
{"text":"3.5/5 - Sushi is my Moto in life. So Let the good times Roll! ;)

The place is very trendy and spacious. Service was really good - servers always made sure our tea cups weren't empty.

Anago, Aji, Ankimo Sashimi and Toro Sushi:
You get what you pay for. Not a wow quality but good for the price. The Toro Sushi was delicious.

Tataki Attack Roll:
$9.95 | 8pcs of Crab, scallop, avocado, mayo + albacore tuna tataki on top
This was such a great roll, and, as you know, I'm a sucker for aburi rolls. The tuna tataki was so fatty and tasty especially after the sear. What I didn't like was the crunchy flakes they put weren't crunchy at all!"}
{"text":"The venue was trendy and enjoyable with a cool ambience and good music, the service was nice and attentive, and watching the sushi chefs at work while sitting at the bar was good fun. Every item we got was also decently tasty. But I'm torn on a 3 or a 4 here for one reason, we got four different maki items with combinations of tuna, salmon, and butterfish and all four were prepared with minced fish. This isn't generally my preferred style, I like the taste of that full fish flesh. But, like I said, they were tasty enough. We got the spicy salmon pizza, the eskimo maki, the poki poki maki, and the SOS maki. Torn!"}
{"text":"The interior is really nice. Came here for a first date and the food was really good! Services is good as well. The waitresses are friendly and even laughed at the banters between my date and I. There was a manager on floor who looked like he was keeping a close eye on customers' needs. 

I'm not sure if I would say it's the best sushi place in GTA but definitely one of the best. 

My date swears by this place. He ordered the beef and yam sushi which he always gets and loves. My fav was probably the spicy salmon. Some rolls were massive and others smaller so I did enjoy the variety. 

My only hang up was the ice cream had massive freezer burns but tasted yummy anyways. 

I'll have to visit one more time and will update my review but I expect it will be equally as good the second or third time around."}
{"text":"I walked out of this restaurant with a smile on my face. I am not the type of person who usually reviews places, but I was so impressed that as soon as I left the restaurant I decided to leave a comment here. 

First of all the service was top notch. The entire atmosphere was friendly, light, accommodating and easy, starting with the hostess straight through to our server as well as the staff behind the counter and even the busboy who cleaned the tables.

Second, the food itself was great and our favorite dish was the one recommended to us by our server. The prices were reasonable and serving portions were generous. Even the dessert was plated beautifully and tasted delicious. If you're in the area, you should definitely visit here."}
{"text":"With each spontaneous visit, the food is always delicious, the staff are superb (service and attentiveness) and overall I love the vibe here. The fact that someone else is complaining about the thick sushi pieces, no clue - truthfully, this is a bonus considering how many other sushi places jip you on portions! That's why I really like this place also, bc they are generous. 
Highly recommend this gem to anyone, for à la carte and desserts! =)"}
{"text":"Its a fancy place and the good thing is the restaurant is open until 2 am in Saturdays. However very small portion but expensive which I did not expected at all."}
{"text":"New to sushi and the staff was really nice in recommending to newbies. Price was great as well"}
{"text":"Ordered a chirashi and thought the rice was a bit hard.   Sashimi was alright.  I expected more from the food quality given the price.  

Staff was not professional.  The server gave us the bill the moment my friend and I finished our dinner.  It was a weekday night and there were still a few empty tables at the place!  Experience was not too pleasant and would not return if I have other options in the area!"}
{"text":"Sushi Moto never fails to disappoint. I've been working in this area for years and we've tried various sushi places. Although this place is much more pricier than the smaller joints its absolutely worth the price! 
The fish is fresh the service is impeccable. If you're going with a group I'd recommend one of the sushi combinations that's served on a boat. Delicious meal every time. Best sushi I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good time coming here. Service and food has always been great. I tried another Japanese restaurant in the area and regretted it immediately. Sushi Moto is the place to be when you're in the area , crave Japanese food, and want great service."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place cause he lives walking distance. I'm not a fan but I'll give my thoughts.

It seems to cater to westerners as crowd is filled With them. Menu is mid-range, not as affordable but fresh and tasty! They carry \"Asahi Black Beer\" which is a plus but most Japanese restaurants do unless it's Chinese own. The waiter wasn't up to speed cause he forgot our drink a couple times with us reminding him. Decor is nice.

Overall, I thought it was good cause we didn't break the bank but combination didn't fill us up. We've ordered 3 \"Asahi Black Beer,\" 2 pint of Hoegaarden. 2 rolls and 90 piece combination platter to share with 5 people. They did throw in Edamame soy beans on the house. The bill came down to $165 with tax."}
{"text":"Honestly this restaurant looks too fancy for what it is. The inside is really dark and really big, kinda liked kinda didn't. We ordered some special veggie rolls that I don't remember the name of... but my problem was that the rolls were SO BIG!!! I could barely fit the damn things in my mouth! Mind you I was on a tinder date and probably looked stupid as hell opening my mouth so wide and shoving them in AND THEY BARELY FIT. I could barely chew the rolls and the crispy things on the rolls scraped the top of my mouth lmao... I don't even remember the taste cause managing just eating them was such a mission. But I'll probably go back but not order special rolls..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best interior I've been to for Japanese food. It's well designed with lots of open space and comfortable booths.

The spicy salmon rolls were very well made and had good presentation! However my friend's noodle was soggy and awful tasting.

For some odd reason the waitress was very conceded and ignore some of our requests. Overall service was really bad, we had to call another waitress to get our bill. Would not be going back!

{"text":"I went to Sushi Moto on Tuesday night. It wasn't too busy. The service was decent. The menu was large with tons of combos, platters and specialty rolls. 

The food was quite good. We had an assortment of rolls and sashimi, all were fresh and well made. The rice wasn't rubbery. The sashimi was cut thinly. 

I love that they had kimchi, which isn't Japanese, but it was a nice change from my typical seaweed salad. 

One notable roll was the lion head which was spicy salmon with tuna and avocado on top. 

I also noticed they had a blowtorch at the sushi bar. I didn't  have any blow torched rolls, but when I return I will make a point to order one. 

I recommend Sushi Moto for a no fuss group dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always have a good experience. The sushi is always fresh and the service is really good.

On my most recent visit, we ordered two garden salads, sashimi, soups, and two salmon/avocado rolls, since I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant. 

Everything we ordered tasted delicious and it was a really nice surprise when they brought out a bottle of gluten free soya sauce. This little detail made my dining experience much better.

The one thing I found odd was, they didn't offer us any green tea but allover it was a really good experience. 

While there, we ordered two alcoholic drinks and they were both delicious.  I ordered the Blue Mountain drink, which is made out of rice wine, various fruit juices and blue curacao. My friend ordered a rum and coke and he really enjoyed it. 

All over, we had a really nice experience and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was around midnight on a saturday, and I had a craving for sushi. I looked up late night sushi for toronto, and apparently Sushi Moto opens until 2am on weekends. I looked at the menu, and I saw that they served Toro and Otoro. So I did a Mr Burns impression: \"Eeeexcellent.\" It's near where I live, but I don't normally frequent Yonge street restaurants because it's hard to find parking, especially free. But since it's midnight, it's free and relatively easy to find.

I ordered 2 things: Sashimi Dinner ($19.99) that includes 18 pieces sashimi, rice, soup, and salad and 2 pieces of Otoro sushi ($19.99).

- First thing I'd like to mention is that they gave me 21 pieces instead of the advertised 18 pieces. Sweet! And this had a good variety of fish: 6 pieces of salmon sashimi, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of red snapper, 3 pieces of yellow tail, 3 pieces of torched butter fish, and 3 pieces of this one I can't remember (If anyone can identify it from the pic, please let me know!). Normally, I don't care for the butter fish (the whole escolar diarrhea thing) and red snapper, but these were pretty good. The light torched taste for the butter fish was a nice touch. The rest of the fish were really fresh. Again, I praise the variety, as many other restaurants will give you a load of salmon, tuna, red snapper, and maybe one other type of fish if you're lucky. 9/10
- The soup was good: not too diluted, not too salty. 9/10
- Haven't had the salad yet. Saving that for later :D

On to the Otoro - Okay, if you guys read my other reviews, you'll see that I love toro, and I will have to compare it to the otoro of Yasu and Jabistro, which are more or less my gold standard of otoro (in Toronto anyway).
- My first impression when I saw and bit into the sushi was that \"wow that's a massive piece of sushi. Had to eat it in 2 bites. When I took a look at the second piece of sushi and then turned it over as I dipped the piece into some soy sauce, I realized it was actually TWO layers of fish. On top was a piece of otoro, and the bottom piece was a smaller piece of what seemed like chutoro (medium toro). The bottom piece of fish plus the rice itself could have been a piece of nigiri sushi by itself probably, but somehow they chose to layer on top another piece of fish. That's why it was so massive.
- From a traditional sushi pickyness standpoint, it was too big. From a getting-your-bang-for-your-buck standpoint, it was pure awesomeness. For $10 bucks for 1 piece of otoro sushi, it's a pretty good deal.
- Compared to the melt-in-your-mouthness of Yasu and Jabistro, this otoro is not as good but comes close. If Yasu and Jabistro's otoro were rated 10/10, this would have been 8.5.
- From the picture, you'll see that the two pieces look different (they put some stuff on top of the sushi and it's gone in one of them). It's my fault, as the pieces sort of tipped over and go messed up while I was driving in my car.
- I kinda wish that my piece of otoro looked like this other fellow Yelper's Otoro (Igor S). His picture of the otoro looked soooo delicious.

It was late, so the order was prepared pretty quickly.

This place might become my go to place for late night sushi cravings.

8.5/10 for quality, 8.5/10 for the service, 9/10 for the value. 8.75/10 overall (not an average)"}
{"text":"This is the sushi place my dad now frequents regularly with his family, and I can totally see the appeal. Classy looking interior with giant booths by the front window are quite inviting. The food has been consistently good, although I have only tried a couple dishes so far. From what I can tell, the prices are slightly higher than average, but so are the portion sizes. If you're in the area looking for a nicer Japanese restaurant, I would definitely recommend. The only negative point is that I have noticed the service is quick at first, then nowhere to be found after you've received your food. Not the end of the world, but a bit annoying if you need to leave by a certain time.

Also, bonus, when you order green tea ice cream, you get 2 scoops of it in a sundae cup. Yum!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good but way over priced for what you actually get. Small pieces of sushi for a large inflated price."}

The staff is great, the sushi is fresh and the cost is not over the top. 
Always had a great experience.  From the bento box dinners to the specialty Maki's (especially the cowboy - sweet potato/beef/teriyaki), never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"the manager and servers are very friendly and attentive.

we tried toro (bluefin tuna) sashimi, and it tasted so good. it's just very pricey ($19.95, usually $24.95). i ordered chirasu lunch (rice with various kinds of sashimi) as main course and all the sashimi were very fresh and well served.

would definitely go back there again to try their sushi combo."}
{"text":"4 stars for decor, 3 for food.

I came to Sushi Moto at least three times during the summer as I was interning in the area and occasionally dropped by for lunch. I've ordered the spicy tuna roll, the spicy salmon roll and the chicken teriyaki bento box. The latter was my favourite - the portions are plentiful and although I wish there was more shrimp tempura included (rather than the veggie tempura) I was satisfied overall. The interior is decorated nicely and definitely carries more of a high-end vibe than surrounding joints (Sushi One, Ichiban, etc.). I liked that the manager is nice enough to greet you as you enter and wish you well as you depart. The larger room for groups in the back is also quite nice (it is set up so that you eat sitting down in true Japanese fashion - a nice cultural touch!). I was not dissatisfied with the rolls I ordered but they did not blow me out of the water, which left me a bit disappointed given the relatively high prices charged for maki. Service was also a bit slower than expected. Overall, not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Had better. Clearly I'm not sure why this place got such a high rating? Perhaps I'm just not that picky about my sashimi? The service was so-so, the food took too long but the decor is nice I guess.

Our waitress wasn't that attentive to us. It was hard to get her attention and most of the time she was no where to be found. They gave us this soupy noodle thing as a complementary appetizer. It tasted kinna weird, nothing special. The sashimi was okay, the roll was okay. I was here for lunch so I just got one of the lunch combos. I guess the place was really spacious but other than that I really don't know what's the rave about. Perhaps I didn't order the right thing."}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a month for lunch and have always had pretty good service here. We are often greeted within the first minute or so.  Our orders have always been taken pretty quickly and our orders are served in a timely manner. 

As someone who likes sashimi and nigiri, I find that Sushi Moto has some of the better cuts of fish for sushi in the area."}
{"text":"This is my go to sashimi/sushi place when I don't feel like trekking downtown for fish. The atmosphere is a modern lounge/bar. I always get the sushi, sashimi, and maki boats, which is great if you want to try many different types of fish. Typically the medium (75 pieces) is enough to feed 4-5 people. They also have a good selection of sake and plum wine. As well, they serve a few different types of beers on tap (steam whistle, hoegarden, stella, etc). The service is quick and attentive. Although some of the servers are not fluent in English, they still try their best to accomodate you."}
{"text":"We talked about our meal all the way back to America! Exceptional sushi! 

Restaurant was very comfortable and the staff was approachable and welcoming. 

Started with complimentary miso soup and a noodle soup - both delicious. Edamame was seasoned perfectly. Tried a combination of basic and specialty rolls - may be the best we've ever had. 

Next time we cross the border we'll be back!"}
{"text":"been here only few times and always for lunch. lunch options are very good and at least vegetarian options are pretty cheap (tofu bento box + soup + salad = $7). the food is yummy! and they have some interesting appetizers like avocado tempura! which is just delicious!

the staff is friendly and helpful. 

I love the ambiance of the place which is high teck but at the same time traditional. 

Judging by the dinner menu - it becomes pricey at night, but it's one of the best lunch places in the area."}
{"text":"This place is crap!  Over priced dog food served here!  Service poor, server practical ignored us...
Way to expensive.  Interior needs a revamp. This place only really cares about you if you order over priced alcoholic beverages.  The time it took to get any level of service was way too long.  I will never recommend this place to anyone."}

It is groundbreaking-ly stylish for this area, no offence to the residents and other neighbouring resto's. If you had a choice to meet with peeps here or next door neighbour to this - Shoeless Joes (Granted they both have their own strengths) meet here. 

Service is more than on point, tempura is food to go, and sushi great. 

The decor is proper. Bar is sexy. Clean."}
{"text":"Classy Sushi Place- Perfect for impressing a date or entertaining fancy guests. 

I am accustomed to eating tons and tons of Sushi at AYCE's and paying less then $20 bucks. I am not that advanced of a Sushi eater to tell the difference in taste- Considering that I drown wasabi in Soy and smother my sushi in it. So they all taste the same.

I did try the popcorn chicken- I don't know why they call it that. was more like chicken fingers deep fried in tempura. Was really good.

However- as expensive as it was. I do not regret it. As you pay more for the ambience rather then the food."}

The food came out immediately after and it was fresh and delicious as always!  I have been coming to Moto for almost 2 years now and it is always consistent, tasty, and provide AMAZING SERVICE every single time! Moto Sushi is simply spectacular !"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and booths. Price is a little higher than many other places, and the sashimi cuts were pretty small (in small sushi maki sashimi boat) which got me disappointed. Also waitress ignored me once..."}
{"text":"I went here last Friday with a friend for lunch. Generally, i feel that going for a la carte sushi is only worth it if you're going for lunch, price wise. 
Loved the atmosphere as soon as I went in. The front of the restaurant looked more like a bar, in my opinion. We got seated at a spacious booth. The restaurant was pretty busy at 1pm. The waitress was happy to serve us and was knowledgeable about the sushi. We ended up ordering a shrimp and veggie tempura basket, avocado crunch roll (or crunch roll), tofu teriyaki lunch, and a chicken teriyaki lunch.
The lunch boxes came with: salad (dressing was really flavourful. captured fruity and Asian flavours), mashed potatoes with teriyaki sauce, corn, and spicy mayo, a gyoza, rice. 
Everything tasted great.
Only cons:
- chicken tasted a bit like tofu (strange....) BUT the teriyaki sauce seemed to mask this underlying flavour. Maybe it's just really fresh??
- Friend said she wasn't a big fan of the tofu and tried better ones somewhere else
- Tempura seemed to be lacking in batter.
Other than that, I will definitely be returning. It is also a good place to meet someone as the environment and decor is pretty nice."}
{"text":"Hip & Fun place.  Staff all greets you happily.  Restaurant and washrooms are modern and clean.  Sushi is some of the best in the neighborhood and pretty consistant.  After trying most in the Yonge & Sheppard area we always gravitate back to Sushi Moto."}
{"text":"The first time my brother's girlfriend took me here I was so impressed with how FRESH & GENEROUS the portions are. We got a lot of dishes and each one was delicious. The small sashimi boat we got WOW oh WOW each slices were THICK & SWEET :-) I haven't felt this satisfied in a Japanese restaurant and coming from West LA that's says a lot. 
I took mom back three days later after I convinced her how healthy it is to eat raw fish and not to mention how much she is  missing out on this awesome place if she didn't since she only lives 700 meters away. I was just impressed with the second time as I was the first. I've been here five weeks and have been back five times. 
The last time we visited it mom and my friend wanted to have lunch elsewhere because they wanted to try a new place for me but I insisted on dining at my favorite place here and that is Sushi Moto.  The manager recognized us when we walked in. I expressed my deep gratitude for their service and consistent great tasting food each and every time. He surprised us with appetizers on the house and took extra extra care with us. 
THANK YOU SUSHI MOTO for your consistent outstanding excellent tasting food & service! Keep doing what you're doing because it's PERFECT :-)
I will make sure my LA friends visit here when they come to Toronto. I will dine here a few more times before I head back next week :-) Love Love Love Sushi Moto!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I wasn't too hungry so I just got a futomaki roll,  but even for this simple roll it was one of the best I've had. For dinner, they also give you some complimentary soba in soup. If it didn't take a while for a server to take our order, I would give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi  places in North York, Ontario. Located on Yonge street just north of Sheppard. The owner is a fine Korean gentleman that I've gotten to know (disclosure) ...one thing I have to say that they don't always have Sea urchin (Uni) but when they do it's really fresh. I continue going there and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town.   Not cheap  but totally worth it. Amazing staff. Super nice Waitress"}
{"text":"Visited Sat June 16 for take out. 

Sushi Moto has been a steady place to go for sushi, eaten here at least twice before. The best place for sushi in the Yonge/Sheppard area! 

Pros
Ordered tempura lunch and sushi 14 (8 pieces sushi, and 6 rolls) were fresh and deeeelicious!
Clean and tidy interior. 
Food was cooked and neatly packaged within 10 minutes. 

Cons
One of the broccoli pieces was a bit big for my mouth, but that is a small inconvenience lol. 
No brown rice available, sushi purists say that sushi cannot be made with brown rice but I would disagree. 

Damage $32 after tax, pre tip. 

Protip - Take advantage of the lunch special which is until 4pm. The manager on duty basically gave me the food I was going to order from the dinner menu for the lunch special price! Now that is 5 star service, thank-you!

Will definitely be coming again, as sushi is my friend!"}
{"text":"Fish portions are on the bigger side. Good was very fresh. Nice atmosphere. Price of sushi was a little on the higher side. The staff were very friendly and attentive. 

I'd recommend coming here but also mention that you get what you pay for some bring the $$$s."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi resto in the GTA! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for 5 years now and it offers consistency every time. If you come here, you'll receive IMPECCABLE service not only from the servers but the management as well. You will also find QUALITY fish and a GREAT ambience. The sashimi and sushi combo sets offer a wide selection of fresh fish and the presentation speaks for itself in these photos. 

This place is perfect for group gatherings as I have come here many times to celebrate birthday parties. You will also find a comfortable atmosphere with TVs, booths, and trendy music. 

Overall, this sushi resto is worth the drive if you are not in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place. The food, service, and ambience is great. The sushi is always fresh and they always serve quality fish with a good variety. It may seem pricy but really you're paying for what you get. You could go for AYCE sushi but wouldn't get the same level of quality or variety. The Tataki Attack role is a must-have! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I was debating with my friends if we should go to our usual \"all you can eat sushi\" or try a new place. And aren't we glad that we went for the latter!! The place is clean with nice furniture. Lots of flat screen TVs which makes it great for sports events. Free fast WiFi.  We were offered complimentary tea and noodle soup. We ordered maki combo 1 which was enough for 3 people. The assortment of rolls were nicely presented and were fresh and tasty. The waitress (Ashley) was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable and answered all our questions. Pricing was very reasonable. Overall it was a great experience and I will surely recommend sushi moto to my friends and family."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time here. We made reservations ahead of time and that day we were running a bit late so we called in and the staff were really kind about it and said no problem. 

Atmosphere is very clean, dim lighting, and comfortable. They have booths which is nice because although it's a popular place, you're not bothered by a lot of noise. Classy and sleek decor. 

Friendly staff and fast service. 

FOOOOOOD: 

They give you complimentary noodle soup which was great, very tasty and it's a good size to start off with. Definitely recommend trying some things from their drink menu, especially their martinis and cocktails. A lot of their cocktails have sake in them and they're just really damn good. $9. 

For appetizers we ordered the calamari, gyoza, kaki fry (highly recommend this one, you really taste the oyster and it's not overpowered by the coating), spicy salmon sushi pizza, seaweed salad and uni sashimi. Everything was really delicious, seasoned well, generous portions for sharing. Uni sashimi is very strong but I guess that's how it is. First time trying that. 

Entree we ordered the large sushi sashimi combination boat. It was beautifully presented and everything just tasted really fresh and delicious. The slices of sashimi were a really generous thickness and the ones with the rice there was more fish than rice which was great. The rolls were delicious and they give you a good variety of fish and rolls. The boat was $98.95 which included 45 pieces of sashimi, 26 pieces of nigri sushi and 24 pieces of maki. This was shared among 6 adults. 

Definitely recommend trying out!"}
{"text":"One of my friend live in the neighbour hood so we decided to go in for dinner.

The decor is very nice. I would say there is blend of western and Asian mix. Few TV around just like a sports bar.

I am not a raw food person. So I am not the best person to tell how the raw sushi paste like. The only raw fish I eat is ... Nevermind.. Guys you know what I am talking about. Hahaha. 

I order Avacado Sushi roll and Tariyaki Chicken. Both of the was good. Not bad. My bill came up to like 30 bucks with tips. 

One of my friend had a boat load of raw sushi. He said it was not bad. I guess I have to take his word for it. Then again nothing beats the raw fish I eat once in while. LOL.

Would I go back. Yes, if I am in the neighbourhood. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here again and was severely disappointed. Got the sushi/sashimi combo and for $50+ (tax tips not included) all we got were very ordinary pieces of rolls and fish. I can easily go to another takeout place and get a much better deal with higher quality. The fish tasted hard and frozen and the rolls were okay, ayce quality. 

It was so disappointing since last visit, we found everything to be pretty good. Service was pretty much nonexistent. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, different interesting rolls, high quality fish.   We would definitely come back.   We are giving 4stars because our service was ok, not great.  Waiter forgot to bring item we ordered, slow bringing more tea, didn't check if we wanted to order more (which we did)."}
{"text":"My fav sushi place in north York!  Did not disappoint with the large sushi boat.  Will come again when we r in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The key to the success of this restaurant, is the active involvement of management.  Right from entering the restaurant, management greets you and ensures you get seated quickly.

From there the food quality is impeccable. All the way from the miso soup, salad, all the way to the sushi and sashimi.  

The front manager took my order. I asked them if they had a lunch combo that included spicy tuna Maki and mixed Sashimi.  They didn't, but he said he would bring me a special order.

The sashimi is some of the freshest I've had in Toronto.  The maki was equally as good and they even brought me some extra spicy Maki sauce which I didn't even need to request.

Add to all this, was the incredible presentation, making for a perfect Japanese sushi experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this on Yelp while searching for decent Japanese food in the city.  Didn't expect much, but we were quite impressed with the place!

Typically, I tend to gravitate toward cramped 10 seater \"sushi bars\" that serve decent-quality sushi with reasonable prices. This one was everything I usually like but with a luxurious modern touch. Nothing pretentious or hyped up about this place though.  Its casual, yet classy style made for a great sushi dinner date with no frills.

Sonia, our waitress, made our experience all the more welcoming and comfortable. I'll have you know, I don't normally take the time to write this kind of stuff in reviews unless something really stood out about the customer service. Sonia's accommodating demeanor, friendly but professional manners, and timeliness of service, really made an impression on me.

My husband ordered the chirashi dinner (came with garden salad + miso soup) and I ordered the spicy tuna maki and California tempura roll. The chirashi was decently fresh - not like \"fresh off the boat\" but fresh to the standards of a big city (?). The amount and variety of sushi was on par as well.  Also worth noting is the garden salad which is so delish!  The salad dressing has an orangy-vinegry-sweetness to it that is so refreshing!  The spicy tuna maki and Cali roll were delicious and \"fresh\".  

Sushi Moto is worth a visit if you are looking for a decent Japanese restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was having a Monday blah day so needed a sushi lunch to brighten my spirits and thought of Sushi Moto.
Their lunch menu had a spicy bulgogi that intrigued me so I passed on the sushi to give my palate a spicy kick! Lunch started with complimentary tea, miso soup, and a sample of a cold soba noodle, not a bad start. The bulgogi came soon after and included salad, rice, kimchi sauced gyoza, and a sea weed salad (not a fan!). Everything was well flavored including the sea weed (did I mention I'm still not a fan?).  The spice level was on point and the portions were enough to satisfy my lunch time hunger all for $14 with tip!! 
While no complaints, a five star would only come after I've tried their sushi given that the area offers a lot of competition! See you soon Moto!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down big time. And the service was pretty bad. I was there around 3. The place was empty and my girlfriend and I felt invisible the whole time we were there. I had hwae duk bab. Everything tasted off. My gf had a kalbi bento which was mediocre. Overall, just a crappy experience."}
{"text":"This place has really bomb kalbi and the service is wicked. Service is fast, really friendly. Went here for drinks too late night and it's a good time"}
{"text":"Situated on yonge and Sheppard, you can't really miss it's huge sign. I've passed this place a few time so when a date suggested to meet here I jump at the chance. 

This is a huge place with very modern decor. Not a typical Japanese restaurant despite the regular fare of sushi and sashimi. We were very surprised to find that it also functions as a sports bar and on this particular night the Leafs were playing and there was a bit of a wait to get a booth, with a TV on the wall next to us.

We weren't really into the game so got a bit jumpy every time cheers or boo erupted all over the place. 

The menu was extensive. Almost all the combination  of maki, rolls, bento combo you could think of is here.  They also had an extensive drink menu ranging from sake cocktail to many types of wine

We had beef enori roll, seafood salad, green dragon roll and lion roll.  The food was done and presented well but I find the portion a bit on the smaller side for its pricing. Because it was a date, I didn't feel right to take photo with of the food.  

The desserts, however, were huge.  We had ice cream and a tempura ice cream. This was a huge ball of vanilla ice cream wrapped in sponge cake with a crispy tempura coating. We couldn't finish it.  

Our server was also very professional and attentive.

Overall, I like this place.  Besides the drinks and the dessert, it doesn't really stand out from other equally good Japanese restaurant but I think one comes here for a different vibe..."}
{"text":"Not an all you can eat sushi restaurant. The dishes were delicious. The restaurant interior was how I liked it for today on a Saturday night (felt the need to avoid Gome type of restaurant), spacious, clean, lots of people and I definitely I cant over hear any conversation from the tables near me.
I had... Special house salad, tataki rolls, lion head sushi rolls, and combination #3."}
{"text":"I came here briefly during the summer when I was waiting on a friend and finishing up an errand. I came pretty early around 11:30AM and was seated immediately - the service here is top-notch and you could tell they emphasized exceptional customer service as they continuously ask for refills of water and helped me out with their menus. 

I had the lunch sushi and sashimi special and I thought it was great - all the pieces were fresh and proportions were big enough to fill me up for lunch. They also had a variety of other dishes like bento boxes, chirashi lunches, and grilled meats. 

Overall, I would definitely come here again to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I came here with some colleagues during lunch. Service was great, and food was just as good. Make reservations if you are planning on going for lunch, there tends to be quite the lineup as of 12:30"}
{"text":"I went for dinner to Sushi Moto because of the great reviews on Yelp.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice.  The restaurant seems to be quite new.  I drive by Sushi Moto almost everyday and never noticed it.  

I was not hungry so I just ordered the Tuna Salad dish.  This has got to be the worst excuse for a salad.  For $11.95, you would expect to have a chunk of tuna fish on the plate/bowl.  When the salad came, I had to ask the waitress if the \"TINY\" pieces of the red stuff was the tuna.  Don't understand why they sprinkled some crunchy stuff on the salad.  There was only iceberg lettuce in the salad.  And maybe a few sliver of carrots???  This salad was not worth $6.00 never mind $11.95. The salad dressing tastes like mayo and is greasy.  I got a heartburn after eating this salad. 

I'm used to the larger portions of leafy greens and huge chunks of tuna, salmon etc from Sushi On Bloor and the price is only $7.95.  You can feed two people with their portion size.  

The rest of the food that our party ordered is ok and nothing to write home about. The portion size of all their dishes is small compared to other sushi restaurants.  If you want a good meal, don't go there. 

The place is good for a night out with friends if you just want to eat some sushi and over pay for the food. but for God sake, don't order the salad.  This is a waste of your money.  Did I say that the size of the salad was miniscule??? 

Don't think I will go back there again for a long time. 

I would have given this a one star but the waitress was very nice, so the extra star is for her."}
{"text":"A little more pricey compared to the other sushi places around, but the presentation of both the food and the atmosphere inside is very classy and upscale. Food quality is great and orders came very quick. Service is also good and employees are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is very nice and the service is very friendly. This is the first time I tried the crazy roll and it's pretty good.the waitress is nice too. Lol 
It's worth trying this at least once. I ended up ordering 4 different roll and finished it by myself. I realized the roll is very small in size but not by pieces. It tasted somehow a minor difference from all because the pieces are small. It got very expensive after all. I think they need to upgrade the special roll!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been to in Toronto.
Excellent service. The decor quite good and relaxing.
Had this 8 dollar lunch bulgiogi bento and it was super delicious. My gf had a chicken teriyaki with sushi. The California roles were very delicious for simple California rolls. The portions were very generous and the price was quite affordable. 
Can't wait to come back and try maki rolls"}
{"text":"I love going to sushi moto!

It's not a sushi takeout place - even though I do that times when I'm craving uni sushi and I'm tight on time. It's stylish! Also reasonably priced for the quality and service. 

Let's start with the staff, I've never had a bad experience here and I come here at least once a week for the past 3 years. So - great consistency. 

The food is fresh and I'm glad they have my favourites - uni (sea urchin), ika (squid) and hotate (scallop) in house most of the time. 

I'm happy to see a mature enough crowd here that knows how to have fun with good food and drinks. 

My favourite Bar Manager Lina is always there. Shes very good looking, attentive and efficient. She works hard to make sure you have a great time at sushi moto. Aly and Dave are also the reason why I can't stop coming to moto. They're just all great?"}
{"text":"Best salad ive ever had in my entire life ! 
Huge quantity and fills you up so much with a side of shared edamame
Unbelievably amazing 
Great experience 
Staff SOOOOO friendly which made the experience even better !"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was OKAY, like any other sushi placed I've tried. I only got the bento box though, don't know if i'll come back to try their sashimi. The environment is more for a chilling+talking and drinking alcohol place rather than a dinner place. Like I said, the customer service is two thumbs up but the food is eh~"}
{"text":"Sushi Moto is definitely pricier than the plenty of other sushi restaurants in the area, but the quality of fish is hands down the best and worth the money. I used to come here quite often as I worked in the area, and the lunch sets are really good and good portion size. The service is also usually pretty good, unless it's one of those really busy Friday lunch hours. I also did try to call one time wanted to order take -out lunch, but since no one picked up (it was right at noon) and I had to run to a meeting, I hung up. 30sec later they called back and asked if I had called them, and I was able to order take out to be picked up 45min later and it all worked out!!
All in all, I have definitely been back many times and would recommend."}
{"text":"After three perfect experiences at Sushi Moto over about 18 months I am starting to believe you're guaranteed a good time there. I like the atmosphere with its slick Asian sports bar vibe, the friendly professional and downright good-looking service, and most of all the food. The quality of sushi and sashimi is simply a cut above your average sushi place. Great appetizers and beautiful salads."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my cousin's birthday with a group of ~30 people (3 long high tables).

The atmosphere was nice - almost like an izakaya - dimly lit, fairly noisey (but still quiet enough to talk to the people around you).

We received complimentary edamame (I assume b/c we came with a large group and ordered a decent amount).  The edamame was nice and unsalted.  Next, we got a noodle soup, which also tasted pretty good.  I ordered the Chirashi Dinner ($18.85, comes w/ miso soup and salad).  The miso soup was pretty typical, however, the salad was better than the average salad that sushi restaurants serve.  Finally, the Chirashi arrived, and unfortunately, it was only average tasting/freshness.  

Service was decent, considering we had a group of 30 people.  The only negative was that at the beginning of the night, they didn't give us enough chairs for everyone, even though we had let them know the # of people beforehand.  Thus, I don't think that this is a great place to host a large event.  13% gratuity was already included on the bill before tax.

Tbh, Sushi Moto was okay.  I liked the atmosphere - more classy than the average sushi joint.  The sushi was just average.  I'll probably have to give their rolls/maki a try sometime."}
{"text":"Visited Sushi Moto with a friend, and was quite impressed: good quality sushi and solid service.

We ordered a small sushi combo (24 pieces of nigri + 18 pieces of maki) to start and split, as well as 750mL of the cold house sake. The fish were high quality and fresh, the rice was a good portion relative to the size of fish, and the maki were well made and delicious. In addition, there was a solid variety of fish offered in the small sushi combo, though I would have loved to have seen even more variety.

We were still feeling a tad peckish after polishing off the platter, so I ordered a few select pieces of nigri sushi a la carte. I ordered the botan ebi (BC shrimp), anago (conger eel), saba (blue mackarel), and the toro (bluefin tuna belly).

Again, the fish were high quality and fresh, the nigri sushi was well made and well portioned, and every bite was delicious. I only wish they had uni available that day, but you can't win them all.

Our meal came down to about $60 per person, before tips, and you can attribute that to having a go at the more expensive a la carte sushi as well as ordering way too much sake for two people.

Sushi Moto was a great meal, and a solid choice for Japanese in North York. I'd love to go back and try more of their a la carte pieces."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better sushi places to eat uptown.  It's run by Korean people so you get a mix of choices on the menu so there is always something for everyone.

On my latest visit I had a great customer service experience.  They were great at asking how everything was and quick to refill your tea and water.  Even though it doesn't seem all that child friendly they were equipped with boosters and high chairs. 

We ordered the maki combo and it came with spicy dynamite roll and two spicy salmon rolls.  I found both to be great in presentation.  I would say that even though the rolls were good they lacked the extra flavour you expect with spicy.  Definitely seemed like the used too much sesame oil and it just drowns out the taste.  The kids got the teriyaki chicken dinner and it was actually great for $10 you get a miso soup (personally found it too salty), chicken teriyaki and rice and the portions were pretty decent.  

They started us off with the crunch noodle soup and normally it is pretty good but that day it was just warm and so I was a bit disappointed.  It is a bit on the pricier side but you get the quality.  Definitely my favourite place in North York."}
{"text":"this place is soo expensive. the dinner bento box is almost $20. the service is good and the food is great but the prices just arent worth it, at all. there are so many places in this area that are much more reasonable with the same quality food. the ambiance is really nice, which is probably why the prices are so high... i probably wouldnt visit again. i'd recommend for people with money to spare lol"}
{"text":"3.5 stars...decent food...nice servers with short skirts LOL"}
{"text":"Interior is really nice here...that was the first thing I noticed. I thought it was going to be superrrr expensive however the prices were reasonable. We ordered the calamari, tataki roll, beautiful roll and a miso soup. Everything came up to ard 36$ which is pretty steep for so little items. However the rolls were very satisfying and delicious as well as the calamari! (best fried calamari we've ever had)

Service was very good, always attentive and made sure we had tea/water and never felt disrespected/rushed. We got our food quickly. Really nice place for date(s) or hanging out/catching up."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and like the food / decor.  However, the food was not as good as it used to be from previous visits.  The scallops and the tataki attack roll were great but the chirashi was nothing special as I have had better elsewhere.  Overall, not a memorable visit."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, fun for occasions with a group or a romantic night out for dinner and drinks. Really delicious Spider Roll and Seafood Salad!"}
{"text":"we stopped by for lunch today. 

the decor looked fancy, i like the environment. the price tag is a bit on the expensive side. you're looking at 20-30 dollars easy per person. i do like their quality of food. we had some salmon and tuna nigiris and they were pretty fresh! the staff there are attentive. cute place!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times for both lunch and dinner since they opened years ago and have  always left satisfied. The quality is very consistent, which is very important! The ambiance is also on the nicer side, not exactly a hole in the wall, so it's a good place to bring people who prefer that kind of environment. 

I only order the raw stuff so that's what I'll speak to. My go-to order is always the chirashi with an order of uni sushi (if they have it available). The chirashi lunch comes with your standard miso soup, garden salad, and complimentary noodle soup with tempura bits, all for $17. Not bad for a full meal! I don't like to eat the butter fish it comes with so I'll get them to substitute it for the salmon at no extra charge. They've also got your standard bento boxes (various teriyaki, sushi etc).

I ordered the agedashi tofu once here and it was the firm tofu instead of the silken tofu. Most other places I've been to always have the silken tofu battered and deep fried so the firm tofu was a surprise. The flavour was also a bit lacking. 

Generally all the sushi/sushi that I've had here has been good but nothing amazing. If you're looking for a moderately priced sushi place that's got a big menu (i.e. something for everyone) the Sushi Moto is your best bet. The restaurant is also pretty big as far as sushi places go so it's a good place for large groups/parties. 

Limited parking can be found just outside on Yonge St. or on Spring Garden Ave (the first street on the right side if you're going North of Yonge)."}
{"text":"Worst Sushi experience ever. Rice is too cold?too watery?tastes like glutinous rice? not sushi rice?and too much rice in one sushi."}
{"text":"Consistently good, fresh food. Super friendly wait staff. If you have a good size party, or a special event they typically throw In Freebies."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for sushi in the Yonge/Sheppard area. High-end feel without the (crazy) high-end price. Service is great, fish is fresh, drinks are cold, booths are intimate. Doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Location is good and atmosphere is nice. Great place to bring friends. The sushi is good and I enjoy some of their special rolls. Can be a little more pricey than your average sushi joint."}
{"text":"I wanted to give the terriyaki at Sushi Moto another chance and boy was I NOT disappointed!! I was there last week on a lunch date with my hubby. It was actually the 2nd time in 3 weeks being back there and ordering the bentos.

Once you are seated, the server arrives immediately to take your drink order. They also bring complimentary noodles in broth - SO good! I could binge on a huge bowl of that, but then i wouldn't have any room left for their fab sushi!

Here is what we ordered:

2 chicken terriyaki bento boxes - for $11.99 there is a generous amount of food including 2 large shrimp tempuras and 4-5 large pieces of vegetables. Not overly battered and not oily at all. The ponzu sauce was perfect! A lot of places make it too sweet, but Sushi Moto has got it on point!

We also ordered 2 orders of our fav rolls which have a good ratio of fish/veggies to rice. 

Special Maki Rolls that are must try items:

Erotica 
Lion Head 
Red Dragon 
Kamikaze

Pics of rolls & bento already posted. :o)

Service has been consistently good even when they are super busy. Doesn't take long to get a table and our server returns often asking if we're ok, or to refill drinks, bring napkins etc. Everyone is friendly and super fast! Hardly any wait time at all."}
{"text":"When I craving sushi here is the best place for me. Usually I ordered Vegas sushi which is crispy and yummy. You can enjoy with many different type of sushi here."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times.  Sushi is ok, but nothing remarkable.  Chicken teriyaki was very bland and dry.  Quite horrible.   

Decor is nice, and prices are high to match.  Food is satisfactory. 

Would not recommend or repeat, unless you are in an adventurous mood"}
{"text":"Really great sushi and other japanese food. The price range is vast so you have the option which is really nice. They serve real green tea (rice green tea) from the start that is really tasty and good."}
{"text":"The sushi place has very nice interior, with a bar. Came here because it is one of the only sushi place that opens till like 2 am. Service was fast and place was upscale and very comfy booths. 

We got spicy salmon roll, spicy California roll sashimi dinner combo, chicken karagee and crunch noodle. Bill came up to like 60 ish which isn't too bad. Considering the environment and the quality of the food. The only downside was probably the chicken karagee they only give you like 6 pieces ? And it was like $7 in my opinion not really worth it, the chicken was very dry and not seasoned well. 

I would recommend this place if you have a late night sushi craving!"}

Although a la carte sushi is expensive, its definitely worth it! Much more fresh and I feel like the chefs put more care into slicing sashimi and making rolls.

Although it was super busy, our waitress was wonderful and catered to us well. The environment is a bit louder than usual and classy. It's semi-casual as the ambiance gives off a more fancy feel.

I ordered the assorted sashimi boat, expecting a lot of cheap fish, but it wasnt too bad! White tuna, red tuna, salmon, etc. Can't expect too much expensive sashimi haha! The slices were thick and not too thin which was great! I also ordered a sashimi salad and some rolls that were unique - something you can't find on a AYCE menu. The food was really good but I don't think I can suck up the prices! Maybe I'll come back another time on a nice occasion."}
{"text":"Quite an interesting find. As I haven't been here before. Invited on behalf of my good friend for helping them with the move...since we had a big party, we were seated in the V.I.P. rooms...closed off from the usual crowd...

We were immediately served with tea, water and etc...they are on top of things... =)

Appetizers were served very quickly. I am very impressed with the service as well as the food. Sometimes it's like choose between the two but this place had it all...woohoo..=D

Freshness. Service. Attitude. 10/10. This is probably landing on my Top 5 for Japanese Restos..as it gets harder and harder every time when I need to kick one off due to service/food...

The fact that I love this place is because I feel the passion they have with Japanese food. The passion and how the people show they don't hate their job is pin in a haystack nowadays...

We drank so much sake...it felt like it was never-ending...nonetheless, everything turned out perfect for the evening...

I knocked off 1 star becuz of parking...nothing else..."}
{"text":"This is the most hippest sushi restaurant/lounge/bar I have ever dined in!

They even feature cute looking waitresses in black skirts and tight dresses, which seem to be a common theme at Asian-inspired restaurants in the area! (Nome Izakaya, Moxies \"feature\" similar wardrobe for their servers too.)

Decent wine and scotch list, if they had them all in stock. I ordered the Highland Park 12 year, but I was told they were out. Much to my sadness.

Good sushi at a decent price, service can be better but it was a busy night so I'll forgive their slack.  We ordered the crunchy noodle soup, take sushi dinner and the sunset action maki roll.  Sushi was done right, sign of a skilled sushi chef and staff.  Despite being Korean owned, they do not serve complimentary dessert and banchan dishes like at most other Korean run sushi joints.  This is something they could consider adding, but given the ambient volume of the place (hip hop top 40 music filled with loud chatter of other patrons) and the small line up in the waiting area, I think they're doing just fine without it. Still, would have been a nice addition to the meal.

I'd go back if I was craving sushi in the area and wanted a dependable place.  

They better have the scotch selection all in stock next time!"}
{"text":"Best chirashi that I have ever had. Owner was very kind to serve me at 10:30 am before they opened. Now this is my regular stop when I am in Toronto on business (even if I have to go out of my way)

Fast forward to today over 2 years later and the owner remembers me and even recalled amazing details of our first meeting. incredible!"}
{"text":"This fine bar/sushi restaurant sits on the former location of the Black Bull tavern beside Smokey Joe's on the east side of Yonge north of Sheppard. The food is really good. This is easily the best sushi restaurant in North York. I haven't been to some of the finer sushi restaurants in Toronto and the GTA, but this is the best experience I've had overall. The fish is fresh, the staff is attentive (sometimes a touch overattentive, and a little touchy-feely), and the bar is new and clean. The chefs really know what they're doing and their plating is traditional. On one recent trip the chef came around the bar to correct the plate position in front of me; apparently the server had put it the wrong way around.

The food here is likely more expensive than other spots in the neighbourhood. The small sashimi, which is enough for 2-3 people depending on how piggish you feel, is $38. The butterfish and whitefish in particular are delicious. They offer many a la carte items, and the menu is well laid out and the items are explained properly. I've never felt off a few hours after eating here as I have at other places.

This place gets five stars from me. I'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"Came here today and ordered their small Sashimi, Sushi, Maki combo. Prior to this, had their chirashi which was pretty good... So wanted to give their rolls and nigiri a chance. However, you just get common fish, a cali roll and a spicy salmon roll which was definitely not worth the whopping $70 after tax and tips. 

For the same price, you can get either much higher quality sushi or at least a lot more. Never felt so ripped off before at a \"sushi\" place.

Probably will not be back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, and great portions. The atmosphere is amazing and my friend and I agreed we have a great time. Will return again and take pictures to include next time!"}
{"text":"Introduced to this place through a contact I have met recently.  It is an overall great experience in terms of service and food quality.  If it was not so out of my way, I would probably say this would be one of my favorite sushi places to go.  Service was stellar as the waitress was very attentive and noticed when we ran out of tea, as well as their salmon Sashimi was on point.  I am always a big salmon person, and their salmon bento box was truly a delight.  Pieces were well cut and in good portions as well, which makes it a plus as I did not have to break my bank account to taste some really good sashimi. 

In terms of environment, it seems like most good sushi places now create more of a pub style setting that is both unique and modern to accommodate the millennial while keeping it classy for the rest of their general audience.  This place seems to always be packed for lunchtime as it is in the heart of mid town and is the go to for a lot of japanese food enthusiasts.   

A huge table with around 6-8 people during the time I was there also got their biggest sushi boat, which I wished I was invited to as the sushi boat was not only massive, but was also a spectacle to admire.  Sushi was very neatly placed and it was quite a nice aesthetic sight to behold.  When I do come here again, especially with a large enough group of people, that will probably be our go to dish for the evening......though I guess I can always go Solo and take it for the gram :)   ."}
{"text":"Came here to try more of their sashimi for dinner.

We ordered:
SASHIMI - 40 PIECES
Came with quite a bit of variety but nothing really stood out. 

WONTON SOUP
Too salty :( 

Service was good but the food wasn't that special (I think I'll stick with just the uni / the toro sushi next time hehe)."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing! the food is great, the service and presentation of the food is the best. Probably the best sushi place i have ever been too, and i eat lots of sushi!
they have very classy food for a great price and that's probably why they are always so full. the inside is very clean and modern. LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, cozy, tasty food. Whether you are searching for a comfy place to have your lunch, or a nice place to for dinner, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Monday night, was surprised how busy it was and had high expectations.

The staff was very attentive.   We Ordered one of the sushi/sashimi combos to share between the two of us and two  hand rolls.   A small appetizer of  noodle soup came out (probably part of the combo) which wasn't very good, overcooked noodles in a salty broth.   The sushi/sashimi was average however didn't feel like it was worth the price they charge, handrolls were pricey for what you got. 

Wouldn't make an effort to come back here."}
{"text":"Great place for work lunch! Service is fairly quick (but still plan for 1.5h if you're a big group) and they have very reasonable lunch menu items. 
I haven't tried their dinner yet. But their fish has always been super fresh. 

I had the chirashi rice lunch set. And the portion was surprisingly big. It came with soup and salad as well. I was totally full after one meal."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like is their sushi bar is full, and I didn't get a chance to sit there~"}
{"text":"The reviews for here were fairly glowing but I thought this was a pretty mediocre restaurant, both in the sushi and the service. I sat at the sushi bar, since I was alone, and it took forever (at least 15 minutes) to even be greeted by a server, despite the fact that I was literally sitting right next to where they grabbed the sushi from to take to other tables. Once I did get greeted, and I ordered and the food came out pretty promptly, but near the end of my meal, I wanted to order another drink but again, it was at least 10 minutes before the server came back (and at that point, a gentlemen they'd seated next to me had been waiting that same 10 minutes to be greeted by a server) so I gave up and asked for the bill. 

I only had sushi, but it was not that great for me. I judge sushi much by the sushi rice and this was very, very sweet rice. Almost too sweet for me to eat. I travel a lot so I've become somewhat critical of sushi and though the fish itself was quite fresh, the overpowering sweetness of the rice made this sushi something I wouldn't consider even trying again. 

I think there are so many restaurants in this area, that you could easily find something better."}
{"text":"I ended up at Sushi Moto for a last minute New Years Eve dinner, and was once again glad I chose Moto! The incredibly friendly staff was able to seat me and my date right away, and gave us a nice cozy booth at the back of the restaurant. The menu there is exploding with hundreds of interesting options. It is also the first time I have seen Avocado Tempura on a menu and it was absolutely delicious. A perfect blend of creamy and crispy. The Maki rolls were all appetizing and I am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"\"A bar first, sushi after\"

This place is actually quite a good bar. But it's also a nice place to get some sushi, japanese cuisine, etc.

It is technically run by a lot of Koreans I believe but that doesn't matter, but food is the great, the staff is friendly and helpful and the pieces they put out look great. Would go back here for an after work drink/meal or a client lunch. Good atmosphere for that."}
{"text":"This place is the upscale brother of Momo Yama located just west of yonge on steeles.  I was a big fan of momo when my gf took me there. This place is no exception. The staff is full of cute asian girls that are happier than the whole sailor moon clique.  The chefs are well kept and are very into to what they are producing.  Now the food. We kept it simple and just went with two rolls. Can't recall what we had but they held up the same quality that I would except. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"Super yummy dinner.  It was Valentine's Day and NBA all star game and the place was packed.  Great service and hope to come here again in the future.  Chirashi dinner was delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Super love this restaurant! Such great service and delicious Japanese food!!! Sangria with sake to die for and the tuna tartare .. omg drool!! I love the decor and music they play too! Best to make reservations to get a booth evening time. Always coming back to this place. Service has been consistent, which is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Holy sushi!

Everything. was. delicious.

From the gigantic salads to the delicious sushi, this place is worth the trip up!

Favorite: Spicy tuna roll  and the mackerel sashimi ;)"}
{"text":"hands down the best sushi place in north york. maybe even in toronto! amazing food amazing service. I've been going there once a week for at least 3 years now. try the green dragon roll and the spicey killer. yummmm"}
{"text":"Great great rolls. Awesome combos. But the service is really slow. So very very slow."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for date night, group meetups and Happy Hours!

My favorite items on the menu is the Tataki attach specifically for the torches escolar on top (yumm). I've tried plenty of other sushi spots around the area and this is definitely a more affordable and high quality sushi spot.  The staff members are also very welcoming when you enter (you can tell its family owned) and pretty well known for its happy hour specials."}
{"text":"My husband and I are both serious sushi snobs, so we didn't set our standards too high coming into the \"sports bar/sake bar\" Sushi Moto-- but wow, were we ever pleasantly surprised.

The restaurant is classy, well designed and bustling: appropriate for a night out with friends rather than a cozy, hole in the wall experience. Staff are friendly, professional and plentiful, and we were surprised how quickly we were served our appetizers and maki rolls.

As for the sushi itself, this isn't top tier sushi, but it isn't trying to be: it's VERY well made, mid range sushi. Some might call the rolls small, but this is the size sushi is supposed to be-- if you have to bite into it, or it's a struggle to put in your mouth, it's not thoughtfully made sushi.

Anyway, we didn't get a chance to sample any of the Korean fair, or the dessert, but I would say this place is going to be a new regular spot for us when we don't feel like trekking down town."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot sushi places in Toronto and I have to say this one is the best hands down!

It's a bit on the pricey side but when it comes to sushi wouldn't you rather have quality over quantity? 

The sushi is so good, and there are all kinds of dishes that are all original. You won't find anything like it anywhere in Toronto. The food comes out nicely on the plate and the taste is just as delicious.

I also like the atmosphere. The decor is very classy, and sophisticated. This is definitely a place to bring a date, your significant other, or a group of friends that want to chill and enjoy a nice sushi dinner together. My favourite thing are the tables with the ice in the middle. You can place your beer right into the ice and keep it cool for your entire dinner. Very innovative!

I've always received great service as well. The staff are very friendly, and kind. I make sure to tip big because the staff are attentive, and take care of their guests.

If you haven't tried Moto Sushi I urge you to give it a chance. I can guarantee you'll be back for more! I know I have!"}
{"text":"To sum it all up: Sushi Moto is a large, busy sushi joint (run by Koreans) serving up pretty good food at reasonable prices in a modern, contemporary setting with pretty good service to boot.

We arrived with a group of 5 and were fortunate enough to be seated in a room on a busy Saturday night. We just barely beat the crowd at about 6PM and the place was already almost full. The menus were fairly substantial, offering everything from cooked food (yakitori), noodle soups, the standard sushi fare, and even a few Korean dishes (bulgogi, etc.). There's a wide variety of bento boxes that look like a decent deal.

We opted to just order a bunch of maki and a few appetizers that night. The tempura was ok, nothing special (they had avocado tempura which is fairly unique). The edamame was good, rightly seasoned. Complimentary soup was offered as well, which was a nice touch. The maki rolls arrived and were reasonably portioned without overloading the rice. There were a number of special/unique rolls that I haven't seen anywhere else. The combinations were delicious and the maki were very well put together, definitely some of the better maki I've had.

Our server was excellent. Courteous and attentive. 

If I'm ever looking for a presentable sushi resto in the Yonge/Finch-Sheppard area, Sushi Moto would definitely be my pick."}
{"text":"The restaurant is fabulous. Recently opened and all I can say is you definitely need to check out the place. I've had lunch, dinner, and after work drinks. The food is very fresh and very tasty. The service is great, and they do a great job of greeting you upon entering and exiting the restaurant. 

This is what North York has been missing....a place to hang out that's not an old runned down bar, but instead fashioned with  modern and comfortable decor. North york was missing CULTURE, and Sushi Moto has answered the call. 

Service is quick and efficient. They do a good job of coming by your table to clear any empty plates, and come around to make sure that everything is ok. I appreciate places where I don't have to constantly call the server to refill my glass of water, but have it filled up for me without even asking.  There's definitely no shortage of menu items. They have a wide selection of a-la-carte sushi and wide selection of Sake. 

I'm thankful there's finally a place to hang out and have drinks with friends and not have to be annoyed by drunk rowdy people. 

My last words, go check out the restaurant and compare it to all the neighbouring restaurants and you'll definitely agree with my review. 

cheers"}
{"text":"This time, we arrived for a late night sushi craving after finishing off Christmas shopping and Sushi Moto really did a great job.  

Instead of the dimly lit booth, we chose to sit at the bar and ordered a bottle of hot sake and ordered some a la carte sushi.  The selection of fish was as decent as our last visit and we were pleasantly surprised the they had sea bream that night.  

Over all, the quality of the fish here is very good.  We liked almost everything we ordered with the exception of the uni (little funky) and saba (too fishy served without fresh grated ginger).  The service was on point and we had a very enjoyable meal.  

The sushi chef was nice enough to offer us some sea bream belly sashimi on the house when we re-ordered the sea bream sushi.  They also offered a few complimentary sides of scallops with green beans and some spicy squid slices.  

Sushi moto offers consistent quality and the fact that they are open till 2 a.m. will make it our go to place for a late night sushi craving.  Awesome job!"}
{"text":"Super trendy place to have sushi! This place is more pricey then some other places I'm used to but it was a great experience. 


Pros:
- Decor: The decor in this restaurant is very nice! I love how modern it is! 
- Service: I love that when I came in the door, my party was greeted right away. 
- Picture worthy: Presentation is fantastic. Rolls were nicely laid out and the decor makes it look nice. 

Cons: 
- Parking: Paying for parking for restaurants really sucks. Unfortunately, you will probably have to pay for parking here because there are no restaurant parking. You can always use the GreenP app to track how much you will be paying by extending the time. 
- Price: The rolls here are higher then other places. 
- Language barriers: Although our servers were very nice, we had some trouble ordering and asking what was popular on the menu. We kind of guessed between our party and luckily, we liked everything we ordered.  


Foods I liked: 
- Avocado tempura
- Yam tempura
- Beef Enoki roll
- Gyoza
- Green Dragon
- Crazy Roll
- Firecracker Roll
- Yellow Tail Surprise
- The Beautiful"}
{"text":"Miku has nothing on Sushi Moto....except about a 50% larger bill. Sushi Moto is my new favorite Japanese sushi place in Toronto. The food, decor and service are all top notch. The sushi bar is definitely one of the best I have been to anywhere. However the bar at Miku in Vancouver does have a better view of the city.

The sushi bar is excellent for the following reasons: a) the seats are comfortable and have backs so you can hang your coat, b) they are high enough so that you're not looking up at the sushi cooler and c) the activity behind the bar is theatrical. With about 7 Itamae (sushi chefs) back there and they are all Japanese. 

There is a great vibe in the place which consists of booths, community tables and a u-shaped sushi bar. There is a \"don\" of the place reminiscent of the head don in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift that keeps a watchful eye on everything, a couple of floor managers and wait staff dressed in black. Very nice!

The food quality is excellent, the nigiri the right size and they even do \"aburi\" style if you're into that (seared sushi). The prices are reasonable. The place gets busy quickly however they seem to seat people quickly. You can't go wrong at Sushi Moto."}
{"text":"Service is excellent! All the servers and store manager try their best to accommodate you. Food is decent. Atmosphere inside a dimmed and they have a lot of tv sets playing sports. Wide variety of cocktails. Would I come again, yes!"}
{"text":"Came here today. 

Great service and very nice interior for group settings. The lunch bento box had great value as it included some Noodle appetizer, salad and miso soups. 

I wasnt expecting to be full with a bento box but it really hit the spot. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I was passing through TO on a cold grey day and was in the feeling for some soosh. So thanks to Yelp I discovered this little diddy in Sushi Moto. I entered on a busy Friday noon hour to witness a bustling restaurant where it appeared that staff was well organized, trained and efficient. I ended up ordering a bulgogi bento @ $11.95. It came with noodle soup then a very generous bento serving of luscious bulgogi, salad, rice, tempura and 3 small pieces of California roll. Excellent value, delicious and delicatable. Only thing I left wishing is that Montreal could have such an amazing bento at such a reasonable price. See folks not to be a complaining grumpy old man, however in high tax QC this bento would go for $15.99 minimum and in some gouge-a-riffic places probably $17.99. Come to Toronto. Land of plenty bountiful inexpensive bentos! Rejoice...it's a great thing!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Moto sushi I always get great service, fish is fresh and atmosphere is really cool."}
{"text":"We used to frequent sushi motto atleast twice a week when I lived in Toronto. I am in town visiting and just now went in for lunch, needless to say I was HIGHLY disappointed. We went for lunch and it took over 35 minutes to get 3 rolls. In the 35 minutes the waitress did not come over once to check on us. We had 2 Things to the rolls we ordered. After our food finally arrived the two ingredients were NOT added and we were charged. They just gave us the ingredients on the side. Thy did not offer a discount or comp. even for the mistakes. This used to be one of my favorite places.  So sad to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

For a 4 star restaurant, I expected more from this place. If I had to choose between here and Kiyomizu, I would pick Kiyomizu without a heartbeat.

I came here for lunch on a rainy day last week. Initially it wasn't busy, but the crowd definitely picked up by the time I left. The restaurant felt more like a bar than a sushi restaurant, which made me feel a bit out of place (everyone eating lunch here was wearing business attire; I had a backpack with me damnit!

For lunch I ordered the Sushi Lunch 11. It came with a miso soup, salad, and this noodle-like dish with soup (I originally thought that was the miso soup). All the starter dishes were great, in fact I thought they were better than the sushi dish itself. When the sushi plate came, my smile turned to a...poker face. There was pretty much no variety of sushi fish, with only salmon, tuna, red snapper, and shrimp. The other problem was the rice/fish ratio was too much on the rice side, that is, there was too much rice and too little fish. In terms of taste though it was good, so 3 stars fits perfectly for this restaurant.

Service was great, which seems to fall in line with the other reviews. I was seated quickly, had my order taken promptly, and the waitresses kept coming back to make sure the food was alright."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish here is pretty good but you have to be willing to pay a little extra. I would actually rate this place between 3 and 4 stars. 

I have been here multiple times. Consistently the sushi has been good, rolls are good as well. I've ordered their massive party combos for large party. It's pretty worth it. It gets pricier to eat here with decreasing # of people in your party. 

I wish they would charge lunch cheaper or have a special price during their low times. Keep regular price for dinner. 
There are lots of space for seating, they also have private rooms in the back for large parties and also a tatami seating. 

Service level is ok, sometimes really good, sometimes average. Overall a chill place to hang out with friends or dinner with family."}
{"text":"Came here hearing good things but was disappointed. We ordered a sushi boat and I was not impressed with the quality of the sushi, given the higher price tag. The restaurant itself however is very comfortable, clean and the service was fine. However average sushi for an above average price won't have me coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"It's not the cheapest place to eat, in the world, but it's a fantastic place.

I was there for the lunch special.  For $9.95 I got the Tofu Bento Box.  This included fried Tofu, a salad, far more vegetable tempura than one person can eat, and a few California rolls.  Not only that, but it came with a soup, too. 

What really put this place over the top for me - however - was the SECOND (noodle) soup that was complementary with the meal.    That was the little thing I wasn't expecting that really made the difference for me.

When I first walked in, I thought to myself: I can't afford to eat here.  But I was wrong.  It seems that when you head way up North on the Yonge line you can afford a touch of class.

I left stuffed."}
{"text":"Ive change my mind about this place. I previously only came for lunch. It's not suited for lunch. This is a night time place. My Saturday night dinner here was better. 

Ordered the small sushi combo was which great as it contained a mix of better rolls (ie not just the standard California and salmon). Maguro was exceptionally good. 

By the way, small sushi is more than enough for two people. I ordered an extra roll by mistake as it was already a lot of food. 

As good as the food was, I'm also rating the place high because the waitress was attractive. I guess we'll put that under service/decor? As a man, it really added to the experience. (My other reviews are more objective).

4 stars out of 5. 

(Note: this place is pricey.)

{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week. Was immediately seated and welcomed by a friendly hello from the chefs. 

Food was pretty good. Complimentary green tea awaits you. Restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. Recommended for anyone looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot so I have to give credit where credit is due. First, the menu is extensive! You can have pretty much whatever kind of Japanese/Korean food you're in the mood for. The sushi is very fresh and tasty. The atmosphere and service are both great. The prices are moderate. It's not too dim, and it's not too noisy. I you want a private experience, you can sit at a booth. More open? Sit at a table. Feeling like a bar night? Sit at the bar. During the day it's a friendly place for families, and at night, it's a great spot for dates or drinking with friends. This isn't the pinnacle of luxury dining by any means, but I would not hesitate to bring a friend here or have a business lunch. They've figured out the right balance of price and quality that makes me feel as comfortable as when I'm at home."}
{"text":"nice service good sushi... I feel too full after eating 30 shushi rolls. And don't forget to try the eel with rice."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. Got a table right away because of a cancelled reservation. Serviced felt a bit rushed as the server asked us 3 times if we were ready to order after being seated only 10 mins. Ordered the dinner bento that comes with soup, salad, tempura, 4 pieces sushi, 5 salmon sashimi and California roll for $27. A bit pricier than other places and a bit overpriced in my opinion. Fish was fresh but overall nothing stood out too much. Would definitely just do AYCE next time somewhere else as it's better value and the quality didn't stand out enough for me to revisit."}
{"text":"Elegant, uncluttered bar atmosphere and delicacies that will satisfy everyone's taste buds whether it's lunchtime or night. Many people actually like it for its nightlife. This place is great for any occasion. With the impressively long menu (the online menu is divided into 19 pages) you really won't have a problem to chose your favorite meal. And they offer delicious meatless meals as well, so vegetarians won't leave hungry either."}
{"text":"One of my top sushi restaurants in all of Toronto. Super fresh fish and their seafood udon is fantastic. Plus the price is very reasonable. I wish they were on platterz so we could order them to the office."}

The sushi is always fresh, service is always quick
We come here once every week or 2 and are always happy with everything
I love their maki - lots of creative options - my personal faves are the fire roll, Cali roll, tiger's tail and dynamite
Their tempura is fresh and not too breaded
My husband really likes the chirashi - the fish is very fresh and the selection is good too
We regularly also get the maki combo 1 for dinner - it's a great deal and it's enough for 2 people
I also love their complimentary soup"}
{"text":"We have been to this place three times and only once the service was on the slow side. 

The owner of the place is the one who originally started Tomo Sushi in Richmond Hill and then sold it to open this one. The menu of this place is very similar to Tomo with a few tweaks here and there. Overall, it's a nice combination of Japanese and Korean dishes executed exceptionally well. 

Modern design, clean washrooms, great food, a bar in the middle of the store. 

The store is bigger than most sushi places. Open concept makes it look bigger yet. Dark walls. TV sets everywhere tuned to some sports channels. Contemporary music to cater to the younger and hipper crowds (very unlike Tomo which keeps playing the same pseudo-classic piano stuff).

It's a long menu so it will take me several visits to try more of their dishes. All the maki rolls are awesome. Outside of that, my favourite dish is Hwe Dup Bap which is a bowl of rice and veggies with an assortment of raw fish on top and a special spicy sauce (made from scratch, I bet you because it's different and way better than the same sauce elsewhere). I'm supposed my description doesn't sound very romantic and doesn't do justice to the dish. But try it you'll be a fan too."}
{"text":"super clean restaurant, good food , nice staff and the food is very pretty

there is parking at the back for those who dont know"}
{"text":"Firstly, this place is semi expensive so I expected good food.

Sushi rolls were average. Makis were pretty good, better than AYCE. However, we got the platter where it's supposed to be sashimi dipped in flavouring sauce, but tasted literally just like sashimi. Come on ...

At this price point/food quality, it's not a good value proposition."}
{"text":"Really makes you want to make a bulk purchase of sake through LCBO  Been here twice.  Came away satisfied both times! The sashimi is good here.  Not the freshest, but more than adequate. They are also creative with their plating, nigiri, and sashimi-based bits and bites. When you order enough sake,  you might be treated to something special that's off menu ;) The waitresses know their sake and can make a recommendation for you.  The sake list is decent and includes sure winners.  Ask the servers for their favorites.  They take note of generous customers,  especially those celebrating special occasions.  I recommend going here for special times when you can afford to order more, but it is also a solid place for straight dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place out!  I came her for lunch yesterday and I had a great sashimi meal. It was definitely on the high end of the price range for lunch, but I find it's hard to get deals on sashimi anyways. Usually cheap rolls = tempura and/or avocado filler. That being said, chirashi is a lot less labour intensive than most rolls.

Service was extremely fast, which was great because I was in a rush. I would come back here for dinner if I wanted to splurge, but overall the price point isn't in my lunch range. I'd say the quality IS good - the salad and presentation were a cut above what I've seen elsewhere, but I didn't see the aforementioned \"lunch specials\" mentioned in other reviews.

I really like the cozy booths and the ambiance.  Next time I'll have to order off the drink menu!"}
{"text":"My brother in law had tried and tried for years to impress me with his restaurant selection. The highest yelp rating I'd given prior to Sushi Moto had been a generous two stars. Perhaps, our palates are just too different. But never had I left a restaurant of his choice without a frowny face, not until Sushi Moto. 

First impression - Service was beyond attentive and warm. The manager and owner both came to greet our table and brought over complimentary appetizers and side dishes. We were treated like family and way overfed before our actual orders arrived. 

Food - My in-laws have a tendency of wayyy over-ordering. Although we came \"not hungry\", we each ordered a full entree plus 3 rolls, 3 appetizers, and a sashimi small to share. Their tempura anything (soft shell crabs and shrimp) were the best I'd ever had! Stayed crunchy throughout and not one bit greasy! Their agedashi tofu were perfectly fried and lightly doused with this amazing sweet sauce. I'm literally dying for more! Sushi rolls - tataki, crazy, and French kiss rolls - all extremely tasty! Their sashimi small - one of the best values ever - generous portion and various, high end cut fish! 

Last but not least, we decided to go all out and sampled their desserts! Fried red bean ice cream, fried twix with green tea, and black sesame ice cream. I was a bit disappointed by the fried ice cream since it wasn't one bit warm by the time it was served. They were heavy handed with the whip cream too. Nevertheless, still a tasty treat. 

My brother in law finally succeeded in finding an exceptional restaurant to turn this frowny, pouty sister in law around. Sushi Moto we all heart you and can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Sushi-wise, a step above mediocre in terms of freshness and how well the maki were rolled.  If you're familiar with sushi in the GTA, the quality reminded me of Japango/Yuzu, but not as much detail to plating as Yuzu.

If you go for lunch, the Specials run 'til 4pm and they're decently priced.  Just a heads up, if you want to check it out, but not necessarily spend the extra $$$ on Dinner.

Food-wise:  I found the broth of the Crunch Soup (came with Lunch), Salad Dressing, & Miso Soup all on the saltier side.  Sushi was decent, again, I find most places in the GTA just mediocre, so Sushi Moto may impress you depending on your expectation/experience.

Bar-like atmosphere with the sushi bar smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.  TV screens and music was quite loud.  Actually, it might as well be a bar that happens to serve sushi!  I found the service just OK.  Nothing above or beyond or extra-friendly.  Just the usual.

Parking sitch wasn't the best as it's located right on Yonge St.  You'll either hafta parallel and pay for metered parking, or Green P it!

I'm not opposed to going back, but there are soo many places on that strip."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've tried, hands down. The sashimi was so fresh, the presentation was spectacular and the service was personalized and so on point. When I was ordering, the server was able to tell that I was just guessing and she started asking me questions on what I liked and then made a different recommendation. The rolls were spectacular also. Also the ice cream was the best I've tried at any sushi bar. I could go on and on with compliments about this restaurant. Really wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area. The host Joe is a good guy and service is good. Threw my kids party here as they have a good space for large groups."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Sushi Moto is a more upscale sushi experience, rather than your cheap sushi spot around the corner. With that being said, prices are above average, but well worth the quality."}
{"text":"Well-managed restaurant with Excellent food and prompt, polite service.
Big place with terrific ambiance; especially if you like sports as they have many easy to see monitors, which creates a Fun, Lively mood."}
{"text":"Fresh, ok service, nice atmosphere, BUT overpriced!! Will go back but not often not worth it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city! Always friendly staff, and fresh fish. I love how they're honest if a particular dish you want isn't the best (eg. I usually get uni, but once the shipment was from a warmer season and the server said its still good but not as good as it could be!) 

Fave thing is the chirashi"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but last night I ordered the tiger tail roll and it was half the size it was in the past. I was very disappointed and starving when I left, maybe just too busy of a night."}
{"text":"Just had sushi at sushi moto. Mediocre sushi and i am not impressed. Large drink menu but the price is on the high side. The price for the sushi is about 1 dollar per piece and it's not cheaper if u order larger amount. The setting of the restaurant is nice but I wouldn't come here      Just for dinner."}
{"text":"From entering this restaurant it felt like I was entering a fancy bar! I really like how sleek everything looks.

Got the chirashi lunch for $14.95+tax. It came with some appetizers: salad, soft noodles, and miso soup. It was a well sized portion of assorted sashimi and it tasted fresh. Service was very nice, prompt, and attentive. I absolutely love the dressing they make for their salad! Omg, I wish I knew how they made it. It's so fresh, orangey, sweet and tangy. I think I might just come here just for that."}
{"text":"Not much different from the regular sushi restaurant 

The design of the restaurant looks a lot nicer than other places. They have a bar concept in the middle of the restaurant and seating all around the restaurant.  

Service was excellent. The waiters were friendly.  

Sashimi was decent. Pretty fresh. 

The salad was very good. It not like the normal salads you get at other places. They have a different dressing which I liked a lot. We had chicken in our salad but the chicken looked old, overcooked, and dry. 

The sweet potato tempura was undercooked. When you bit into it the potato is semi soft. 

We also ordered some take out. The take out portion seemed very small. There was like half a bowl of rice in the dinner set. It's better to dine in at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Be prepared to pay a wee bit extra for the experience. 

The atmosphere in here is pretty chillaxed (yes that's a word for super relaxed) everything is pretty fancy and it's usually pretty busy. 
There's the option of a la carte or combo which are only beneficial if there's a group of people because it's quite costly. Everything is pretty fresh and the employees are quite friendly which is also a bonus. 
Perfect for large groups of friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  Never had a bad experience here.  Awesome choice anytime!!"}
{"text":"Quality, service, atmosphere of this place all get 4/5s. 

But the price is a little high, specially for dinner, even though I admit the portions are larger than average of other sushi places.
All foods are fresh - first most important attribute in a sushi place."}
{"text":"lunch bento and  chirashi were awesome! Staff here are so nice and friendly !!  Raw fishes are fresh in this place!"}
{"text":"My partner introduced me to this place as she used to frequent here.

I ordered nabi yake udon and rainbow maki. The quality of the fish was above average. The salmon, shrimp, eel and tuna were tasty. 

The udon soup was delicious too despite being a bit fishy from the cuttlefish. The broth was a little bit salty. The shrimp tempura was still crunchy upon arrival. Noodles were soft with the right texture.

My partner ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. It was sub-par. The chicken was cold.

Our server was attentive and friendly.

The prices are comparable to other above average sushi places. I would come here again but never for the bento box."}
{"text":"Loved this place when I was living in north york. Great price for the quality and quantity of sashimi you get in the sashimi lunch/dinner. It's also good for a quick workday lunch if you go to work nearby. There are plenty of places. Never had to wait for table or food."}
{"text":"Sakilinis =Sake infused fruity mixed drinks. Tasted the cranberry, yum.
 To me, sake used to be boring and just a staple while enjoying sushi. At least, Japanese costums have brought this tradition down to most sushi restos. This was insisted on by hubby and thankfully I have grown to enjoy it likewise, aside from my green tea must-have beside my soysauce. 

It was a Friday night, not busy surprisingly.
Our server was fantastic, very engaged with us ladies and not in an arrogant `hitting on us`kinda way. Very helpful and eager to make improvements when necessary. In our case, seating.

The fish was very fresh. We opted for the combination sushi platter with sashimi and everything was incredibly fresh. Seaweed salad was nicely presented, so refreshing. Great start to a great meal indeed.

For a group of 4 girls, the combination platter we chose was around $30PLUS and it was enough for all of us besides the soup and salad.
Their pinot noir was yum and we finished it off with sake ofcourse. 

The ambiance was ok. Crowd was a mix.
I`m giving this a 4 out of 5 because it is open til 2 am which is awesome when I get sushi cravings late at night in the future."}
{"text":"We will come back here 100%! Loved loved loved!! 
Great service and even better food. I don't have a lot to add.  Just try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really nice dim atmosphere with very friendly staff! 
The sashimi was really fresh and the rolls were a bit smaller-sized but they tasted great. We ordered the small sashimi set, 2 specialty rolls and a hamachi appetizer and we were decently full, but not stuffed.

The food was good and I had a great experience here! Will come back~"}
{"text":"I've been here once and ordered a large sushi and sashimi platter and a bento box. All the food here is good - tempura is well fried, chicken tasted like organic (not sure it is, but it was so good!), and all the fish tasted so fresh and satisfying.

They also give out a small bowl of udon broth with somen noodles, had I known I wouldn't have ordered the miso soups... but the miso soup was good too.

The ambiance is more club-like. Waitresses and bartenders wear revealing clothes and the music is loud. Despite the ambiance, there were a lot of tables with families, including us.

Service was great - they were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed even though it was busy.

If we visit Toronto again, we wouldn't mind coming here gain for the awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm not huge on Japanese food but this place definitely changed my mind and shone as one of the best, if not the best, Japanese restaurants I've ever been to. 

The sashimi is fresh and delicious. The seaweed salad is perfectly seasoned with sesame oil and whatever else they use. The beef teriyaki uses good beef unlike other restaurants I've been to. The miso soup was delicious (except for the tofu but that's because I strongly dislike tofu). The dessert of black sesame seed ice cream was also quite interesting and reminds me of the Mediterranean halva. The tempura candy bar (we got Oh Henry but there's Mars, Snickers and others) was actually quite delicious. It also had some vanilla ice cream.

Overall, this place was very tasty and better than other Japanese restaurants I've been to. It's much more expensive than your average sushi place but it also tastes much better than it too.

Usually Japanese makes me feel kind of sick but this time everything was deliciously satisfying. I would come back here again and usually I never say that about this style of cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is my go to Japanese restaurant
* Near to my house
* Spacious
* Extensive menu of sushi, hand rolls, maki rolls, sashimi, appetizers, salad, rice, noodles 
* My favs are soft shell crab, agedashi tofu, unagi, butter fish, sunomono salad (seafood with seaweed and ponzu dressing, SOS and tataki attack (torched butter fish is amazing) rolls. 
* Complimentary soba noodle with hot tea is a bonus point. 
* Service is top notch. Very attentive and friendly

- i dont highly recommend dinner items ( rice and main dish). It is only average compared to other items that they have to offer."}
{"text":"I've been checking into this place once every few months to see if the quality has been consistent.. it was for the last year, but it has slowly been declining.. I still have hope for this place.. maybe just an off day.

Sometimes when I order the tatami attack, the portions are smaller, sometimes there's less scallop on top, sometimes there's extra toppings and sometimes not.. 

This time I ordered it, it lacked flavour and was torched differently... more like cooked half through than instead of torches.. I think it was also missing sauce and something else.. 

I don't know how to explain it, but I visited on a weekday around 2pm and ordered items I've ordered before.. the tatacki attack and a small sushi and sashimi combo.. However the fish just seemed less fresh.. the portion was a good size, but they also lacked fish variety that day- no mackeral? 
All the torched fish slices seemed off.. almost tasted like they half cooked/warmed fish because the torch flame wasn't high enough but they kept the flame on it too long so it ended up cooking the fish half way through.. 

I hope my next visit will be better. 

-hopeful"}
{"text":"I had a great sashimi dinner at Sushi Moto.
Awesome salad to start - the dressing was phenomenally good!
Plus a complementary starter soup and also miso soup. Both were very nice - not overly salty.
The sashimi arrived on a bed of nicely done seasoned rice. Fresh firm sashimi which I appreciated greatly.
Hot tea before and after the meal.
It isn't often that one leaves a sushi bar comfortably full while not paying a huge amount for it.  After my CAD $ 21.41 sashimi dinner, I did not have room for any dessert or fruit.

To think that I spent USD $ 265 at Brushstroke in NYC on the weekend. Let's just say that Brushstroke came out 2nd best against Sushi Moto."}
{"text":"Here again and the service is just as good if not better. The manager recognized us and gave us a nice big booth to sit in. I'm seriously getting addicted to their food. Their complimentary mini soup starter is delicious. This time we ordered harumaki to start. Hubby got the wonton soup & ive ordered the Canada roll & cowboy roll. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Been there few times. Food quality is very good. Staff are nice. Has good display and quality."}
{"text":"Was first introduced to Sushi Moto a couple of years back and am impressed by the quality of the food, excellent service and beautiful decor.  I am a fan of their Japanese/ Korean mix in Bento Boxes, offering Kalbi or Bulgogi as the main protein to go along with Tempura shrimp and veggies.  Pricing is a little higher than the area competition but the above mentioned quality of food, service and decor, justify the higher prices."}
{"text":"First and foremost, it's a bar. There is lots of drinks to choose from, including my favourite dry Asahi 640ml, which can be conveniently shared by two people. 
The atmosphere is trendy and upscale, I like the wooden decor and bar tables. It is actually larger than you first think because there is also a large room at the back. The servers are nice and friendly, they strive to be good, but can forget some things here and there. 
Now for the sushi, I'm not especially thrilled by their maki, somehow they are always average, I almost cannot tell the difference between dragon roll and California. I think it is best to stick to sashimi or nigiri at Sushi Moto, because their fish is fresh and their cuts are well done. The garden salad is a hit with me, I worship anyone capable of throwing tasty home made dressing together, the lettuce is crispy fresh as are other ingredients which makes for an uplifting combination with the dressing. Their shrimp tempura comes with some veggies, which is a great touch in my opinion.
So overall it is a nice place to grab a bite before the movies at Sheppard Grand, but it is bit pricey for me, so one star off."}
{"text":"I went during lunch, and it was a ghost town. I saw at least 4 people working there and waited 3 minutes for someone to take my order for take out. Overall service was poor. As for the food, it was okay for the price, but there service was so terrible, I probably won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"I wonder if I were to review this place again and give it a 4 then it could have the 3.5 that I think it deserves.

I went to newly opened (as of May 18th) \"Sushi MOTO sake & wine bar\" with a group of four before going to the Sheppard Grande for a show.  The decor is slick and more downtown than North York.  Think Keg Lounge styles; dark banquettes and flooring, fancy wood panelling.  There are even a few counter height tables with troughs cut out in the centre filled with ice to better keep your drinks cold.  Several large flat screens were showing the hockey game.  Even the bathroom was newly renovated.  The service was friendly and earnest.

Between the four of us we ordered mostly maki rolls nicely presented on rectangular plates with veggie garnish cut into butterflies.  The beef teriyaki was very nice, cooked from a whole piece of thin steak.  The complementary noodle amuse-bouche was a bit soft.  My Asahi can of beer ($10) wasn't as cold as it should have been.  The menu is extensive and a bit confusingly organized.   I felt that the total bill was on the higher side for standard issue sushi.

Sushi Moto has a lot of promise and I hope with opening week jitters out the way they will be deserving of the 4 I really want to give them!"}
{"text":"My Go-To place in North York. Great food, very chill atmosphere and great drinks (Asahi Black is an amazing beer you can't get at lot of other places).
Managers, especially Joe, is amazing and very attentive.
Best for first date, dinner with friends/clients, or even just to drink and chill. Very flexible place."}
{"text":"Just so-so. The atmosphere was decent, not overly busy. Food is just alright, sometimes not really fresh. Would we visit here again? Not if there are other places to try."}
{"text":"VISIT CHINATOWN!!!!  The reason for the duel names......Sushi Moto was once Dragon Sushi, but no more.  And Sushi Khan bought Sushi Moto, but are waiting for the change over of the signs facing the street.  So if you're meeting a friend there, it's Sushi Moto (so's you don't get lost)......if you get a frequent eater card after you dine there a couple times it's Sushi Khan as it says on the card and menu.

That being said......this is by far the best place to go for \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" sushi.  Some places get skimpy and serve you smaller portions.  Or give you a time limit and take their time making your fish.  But here, it's Fantasy Roll time,  or Royal Flush Roll, or Rainbow Roll...or whatever roll you happen to wish for or see on the menu.  They'll even make you a nice plate of Tuna Poki as part of the all you can eat.  And in a timely fashion.

It's $19.95 for lunch (45mins) and $24.99 for dinner (1hour)

My friend Jessica and I go quite frequently.....she has a sushi chef she fancies there that see calls \"Kitchen Boy\"....I think she has a little crush she doesn't want to fess up to....yet.   The bad part is that I don't remember \"Kitchen Boy's\" real name, so the last time I was there I called him that......I thought I was gonna end up in a hand roll. ( note to self : don't do that again unless you're a cute brunette chick )

So the benefit and a very recent one at that, of eating at Khan frequently is the Frequent Eater card....after you've had 9 glorious seating's your 10th meal is free.  YAY FREE SUSHI.....that's better than friggin' Christmas."}
{"text":"Let's be real here. You're not here at Sushi Moto because you heard that the sushi there is \"hands down the best you will ever have\", or that the food is so amazing, you had a \"foodgasm\", or  [insert other Yelp/Foodie cliches here].

At the end of the day, if you're coming out to Sushi Moto Wine and Sake Bar, you're some kinda yuppie with some kinda money to burn, and you wanna sit in a fancy looking place to have sushi that you could have eaten for half the price at Sushi Bong down the street - and really almost any other sushi joints in the area.

The two of us sat down in a large booth, and we ordered asahi, plum wine (they only have one selection), chirashi, and three rolls. I'm not going to go into which rolls we ordered because they were all really good. The unfortunate issue is just the pricing. $90 after tax and tip for two and only one drink each - that's unfortunate, no?

They have wide selection of wine and sake (although sushi and wine sounds weird) and would prefer it if you sat down and had continued to drink all night long. 

This place is really either a 3 star or a 4 star depending on your expectation. If you're expecting value, then it's a 3 star. If you are expecting a fancy night out with some girlfriends or boyfriends (i don't judge), with no money concerns then it would be a four star.

My bumping this up to a 4 star is not because i have money to burn, but because my friend does :)"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Waitress was very professional and was always around to clear plates, and refill water but never intrusive.

Ordered a Maki platter that fed two. Price is on par with toronto sushi, and the food is excellent. Parking is limited to street parking, however, parking is plentiful and free after 9pm on weeknights on the streets immediately north and south of the restaurant.

Had a great experience. I would recommend it to others, and i would dine here again."}
{"text":"First time to visit Sushi Moto. I love their modern ambience. Their interior seemed like being built for any customers from all of walks. They provide various types of seats for individuals, small groups and large groups. My husband and I were seated at very comfortable table. Our server was very kind and attentive. We ordered Chirashi Sushi Dinner, Beef enoki roll, Sashimi Dinner, and Shrimp and veggie tempura udon, For drinks, a bottle of wine and Hoggarden on tap. For dessert, Pineapple sorbet. They were all satisfying. We are very strict to the freshness of Sushi & Sashimi cuz we can tell which one is fresh or not based on our experiences. As sushi & Sashimi Experts know, it is hard to taste high quality of sushi and sashimi for just  $$ price level. Sushi Moto did not let us down. Just for the tip, Hamachi was soso, but other sashimies were fresh and delicious. 
I am very very happy eating fresh sushi and sashimi. I will definately come back when craving for sushi!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here on Halloween night around 5:45pm. Fantastic customer service. Quick at removing empty dishes, continuous refill of tea and water.  Had their softshell crab appetizer, tuna tataki salad, deep fried chicken pieces (?), and a sushi dinner.  Price should actually be $$$, but worth it.

Their food presentation was great, and quality is not the bottom of the barrel.

*Bathrooms are downstairs and not accessible to all."}
{"text":"Came here for a small friends get-together and made a reservation just in case. I was the first one to arrive and they brought me to a booth (yay!) and as I was waiting for the rest of the group to come, they kept coming up to me if I wanted anything but I declined. When everyone came, we got to order and they (my friends) were surprised that this place was a la carte and so they were iffy about it. I got the lunch bulgogi bento box and I enjoyed it. Since my friends were used to ayce, they did not like it much but it was a good place to try!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I would take my friends to for a sushi dinner party. It looks very classy and the service was excellent. The maki combo 1 was just enough for a party of 3 I would say, even though we ended up ordering the 6 piece Philadelphia maki in addition due to my persistence. I have had better Philadelphia rolls elsewhere in Vancouver and it didn't quite compare to that. That's why I give this place 4/5. Other than that I'd definitely come here again and probably try their other options.  Our waitress explained the menu well to us when we asked about the different combo platters. I'd say the crowd is higher than average class and they're busy for a Monday night."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to have dinner here a week ago. Ordered Dinner got appetizers and the manager noticed  we hadn't gotten our entree's yet so bought us a round, sincerely apologized and, then went out of his way to personally stay attentive while they got us our meals. BTW I never said a thing to anyone but he took this all upon himself. We watched him helping servers, busing and setting tables, delivering food etc. In the dictionary under customer service should be this managers picture. Like I said is a previous post, I travel for both pleasure and business over the past 30 years and this guy should have his own place because he treats this one like it is his. BTW the food was a 5 too! Wish I knew his name to personally thank him.
Great place!"}
{"text":"I think this area has more than its fair share of sushi and Japanese-Korean infusion restaurants, so I'm not sold on the concept. But this place is more roomy and trendy than the rest of them. There is plenty of room for large groups. In fact, there was a big group celebrating a birthday right next to us. 

The seating and ordering was a bit of an ordeal. The restaurant seemed understaffed and the servers looked a little disoriented. When the food arrived, all was forgotten. The sushi was good, not extraordinary. As much as I liked the decor and the expensive looking dinnerware, I didn't care for the disposable chopsticks.  

The thing that impressed me was the terrific service. Our waiter was incredibly friendly. I'm mostly saying this because of a mix up at the bar, which resulted in us having two extra pints of beer on the house!!! Aside from that lovely little surprise, he offered us things we did not even think about asking i.e. spicy mayo."}
{"text":"Rating 2.5

I've walked past this place many times and heard good things about it so finally decided to give it a try. It always seems busy and has good reviews so I was expecting this place to hold up to that. Walking in to the restaurant, I thought the place looked very spacious and modern. We ordered a few dishes (sashimi combo, maki roll and stir fry soba noodles). The noodles came out 1st, and it was drenched in an overpowering sauce. So much sauce that it would drip down the noodles as you ate it. Not good. I thought to myself that maybe their cooked dishes just wasn't their forte and that their sashimi and rolls would make up for it. Also, if I'm having a sashimi platter, I would think that it would be served first.  When the sashimi platter came, it looked pretty decent, but as you tasted it, there was no freshness to the fish, and it was on par with AYCE sashimi (if that). The rolls didn't make it any better, it was tiny, filled with fake crab meat and drizzled in an overly strong sweet sauce. It was also supposed to be \"torched\". I saw specs of char, if that qualifies. All in all, nothing in particular was done extremely poorly, but if you put it all together, we were disappointed with the quality of the food and none of it felt authentic. Also if you factor in the price, it made the experience worse as the value you get for what you pay is low."}
{"text":"Love the decor, trendy ambiance. We got one of the sushi & sashimi boats and requested it to be gluten free and they were very accommodating. They also have gluten free soy sauce available. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Best sushis! I loved the avocado salad! Also the warm saki tastes great! Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a good Sushi place!"}
{"text":"Really positive experience here tonight. The sushi rolls were well constructed and the house sake went well with the dinner. The house salad was really good; that zesty fresh orange dressing is terrific. Service was polite and friendly without being overwhelming. I will definitely be back for a Jello-tini!"}
{"text":"This place is waaaay overrated and OVERPRICED! Its lacking proper customer service big time. Came in on Friday evening around 5pm, half of the restaurant was empty. However waited at least 5 mins to get noticed by staff that was very busy with organizing take out party trays. After finally getting sitted nobody even came by the table for at least 20 mins. Ordered salmon rolls for $15! and got tiny 8 pieces of California-sized maki which usually cost no more than $7 bucks at other places. Seriously? Overall it seems like servers don't care much about patrons sin they are always busy anyways."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday based on a friend's recommendation and was pleasantly surprised. My girlfriend got the chirashi don whereas I got a sushi maki dinner set. Although the dinner set was good, I would definitely get the chirashi next time. Along with a perfect sashimi to rice ratio, it was very fresh and tasty. I highly recommend Sushi Moto if you're around the area."}
{"text":"An absolute stellar experience in service and attention for detail.  Being a \"sushi sob\" in the many key cities of North America, I can honesty said that Sushi Moto was above average for food.  The salad, miso soup and ice cream are superior.  I recommend the black sesame ice cream for sure!  

Special thanks to Bill for creating a extraordinary atmosphere where he treated us like family. Even thought it was my first time here, my son thought that we were good friends!  A very inviting staff and management.

When I return to visit my cousin again, I will also surely frequent again to see The Sushi Moto staff.  Thank you for delivering an absolutely wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Have been here a few times and consistently  the same.  Very upscale vibe.  Bento lunch boxes are quite filling and ranging about $12+ with 2 mini soups and picture as seen.  Very clean and inviting in all aspects."}
{"text":"This place located on Yonge just north of Sheppard was much more fancier than I thought it would be. Service was great but I can imagine how parking could be an issue since it's right on busy Yonge St.

The ambiance is very Chic if you're into that. Decor is quite modern. I have to admit that the waitresses are quite attractive -- but I'll let you be the judge of that.

I was only there to catch some drinks with friends so just had an Asahi and beef tataki which did not disappoint.

Price point is higher, so don't forget to bring your wallet with you."}
{"text":"Sushi Moto is my go-to for Japanese food in North York. I have never had to wait for a seat and I've come for dinner here twice. Their udon noodle soups are excellent (and reasonably priced)! I especially loved the spicy seafood one. Their rolls are decent, not the best I've had but made fresh. The ambiance is cool, and service is good. Solid restaurant"}
{"text":"2.75 star rating:

Hello, 

I am writing this on the basis of a SINGLE experience with this restaurant, weekday dining for one, ate at the bar.

1.  Host(ess) and first impression:  Greeted at door by possible managerial staff.  Very friendly, rapid seating.  Sparsely populated.  IMMEDIATE strong odour of urinal permeated the air throughout the evening.

2.  Table:  Ate at bar.  Clean.  

3.  Service:  Waitress extremely attentive.  Came out once chewing food.  Very friendly.

4.  Food:  One appetizer, one main (from Dinner menu selection).  Plates clean and presentation precise.  Appetizer was drenched in sweet sauce.  Tempura was well breaded, seasoned and tasty.  Main entree course (sushi and sashimi) was prepared in advance and left to sit on top of the cooler, as opposed to inside of it.  Most dishes were served rapidly and in rapid succession.  

5.  Drink:  Water and green tea.  Warned tea was hot (service).

No dessert.  

6.  Cost:  Approximately $30.00.  I do not have adequate comparison for restaurants in this area; thus, I cannot comment.

7.  Washrooms: Again, smell of URINAL throughout restaurant AND during course of meal.  Did not use washrooms.

8.  Staff:  Chefs were busy as well as pre-occupied with sports on television sets.

Conclusion:  Overall, poorer rating due to smell of urinal in restaurant and main entree sitting out while other dishes being consumed.  Staff very friendly and attentive.

Thank-you."}
{"text":"The ambience is really nice and classy. You can tell this place is pretty upscale. The decor is very modern.

We ordered the battered soft shell crab to start as well as some beef rib starters. My friend absolutely adored the soft shell crab. The beef ribs were tender and tasty.

For the main we shared a sashimi and sushi platter combo. All the fish was fresh and they had a very nice assortment. We also ordered blue fin tuna sashimi and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure I get the hype. It was good, but nothing that made me justify it's exorbitant price (nothing on Sushi Moto, just my opinion over blue fin tuna) but at least I can say I've eaten it now.

Service was very good. Accommodating and always ready."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and got the Sushi Sashimi Bento ($16.95). It came with miso soup and a small bowl of noodles as starters. Everything tasted good and the meal was filling. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant as well. Overall, happy with the experience. 

Taste:  4/5

{"text":"For such a price amazing taste  highly recommended  interior design needs to be updated  thanks for the staff being gentle and helpful"}
{"text":"this is a great place to have good quality fresh sushi

The best thing I like about this restaurant is the service is quick the location is good and the hours of operation are long the restaurant typically opens until 2 o'clock in the morning on the weekends and at least till midnight during the weekdays

The one thing that impressed me the most about this restaurant is that management is very hands on they will always make sure that you are greeted right away and they always say thank you for your business at the end"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress was not apologetic at all after taking the wrong order and was blaming me for not recognizing the mistake when she served, which makes me wonder who's the customer. I don't care much about the wrong order but the waitress's tone is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today and I think this place is a little over rated. after reading reviews i expected a lot more........ I can tell you the inside is very nice with flat screen tv's and comfortable booths but the food isn't as great as the reviews here suggest. It is just ok and not spectacular especially for the price your paying. there are a lot of better sushi joints in the area or 15 mins away rather."}
{"text":"I came here from referral of a foodie, and I'm surprised from the wide selection of rolls, they are good. When they put us into the private room area, I didn't even felt we are being segregate from the rest of the crowd, the waitresses are super friendly and attend to all our needs before we lift a finger."}
{"text":"This place is big, has a cool mixed bar/sushi/asian layout with a buck of communal bat height tables, is hip but not overwhelmingly hipster (or whatever the Canadian equivalent is), has very bright, sweet, professional servers and an authentic feel and vibe. Good fresh fish, larger than average portions for the money and large menu with classic and interesting interpretations of the range of sushi offerings. 

The sushi pizza, sashimi, bulgogi beef and onion platter were all excellent. Adequate selection of local and Japanese beers to compliment. 

A great oasis from the bustle of the Yonge/Sheppard corridor and holds its own amongst the miles of excellent Asian and Middle Eastern restaurants along found between highways 401 and 407."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and they are serving really fast even when its crowded .
I really like the food , I had the best sushi and maki rolls here .the only reason that my review is 4star is , the rest room area and washrooms was \"Very\" dirty . 
They used to keep them very nice and clean but last night , it was awful .
I don't want to get to detail but I lost my appetite after visiting the washroom last night."}
{"text":"I didn't even try the food....

It's Friday, date night and I'm ready for some good food and great company. Where to go? Where to go? North York has some amazing places right? Well Sushi Moto was supposed to be one of them, or so I heard.

I walked in 15 minutes before my date to grab a table and get settled down. Maybe order a drink for her so it's ready upon her arrival but no! My good intentions were squashed immediately. 
Talked to a man who looked to be the manager at the front door and asked for a table of 2. The man said no but we could sit at the bar. He said there was no room for 2 people at a table. Keep in mind the place was less than half full. LESS THAN HALF FULL! I get his response if I wasn't dressed appropriately or looked like a homeless man but I was suited up (from work) and looking hot as shit.
I pointed to several empty booths and he said 'that's for large groups only'... I didn't get his attitude to I gracefully stopped and said I'll go elsewhere.

I'll NEVER support this business ever."}
{"text":"It's amazing. I've been going to this restaurant for years and I thought I already reviewed it for Yelp.  I saw a couple of Yelp Friends showing their love for the place and I feel I need to do my bit for a great place.
I rarely give 5 rating on restaurants. You have to be unique or just that good for me to do it. Sushi Moto is an excellent restaurant for all occasions.
When the Black Sheep Pub closed years and years ago!  This place had the audacity to open up where one of my fav pubs used to be.  Also, I thought that it could not possibly survive due to the sheer size of the restaurant along the over-restaurant-populated street. Most places come and go and I thought this one might follow since Yonge Street's fickle clientele can kill off any mediocre place in a heart beat.
Years later, Moto is still here. A testament to good food and good service with the right attitude makes for a successful business.
Let's get down to the food. Their sushi has been always fresh and generous in the size of the cut. Those of you who complain about the cost of it deserve to go to the AYCE joints and \"enjoy\" the paper thin cuts of weeks old fish.
My usual order is the Shrimp and Veggie Tempura (one of the better ones in the city), the Cold Soba Noodle, the Sushi and Sashimi combos and...SAKE!!!
Joseph has done a good job of staffing the place with the right group of people. Young attractive servers and seasoned veterans service the hip and happening crew right up the the biz peeps and family diners.
They get quite busy for dinner so go ahead and make a reservation and try one of the excellent places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant has ABSOLUTELY spoilt me- best sushi and Japanese cuisine I have ever had! No other Japanese restaurant compares now. My recommendations are the Lion Head Sushi and Spicy Chicken Dinner. You will NOT regret it! The Spicy Chicken Dinner is served with a delicious citrus-laced salad and flavourful miso soup to start followed by a platter of skinless, spicy, saucy chicken on a bed of well-seasoned vegetables (mainly onions). This is served with a side of plain rice but the chicken is delicious enough to eat on its own! I come here at least once a month as prices are just a tad steep, but the food is definitely worth it. The ambiance is absolutely perfect as well and service is always impeccable! Staff are courteous and friendly and the manager will often come around to ensure customers are getting whatever they need. Love, love this place!

EDIT: They have changed the menu and the spicy chicken dinner is no longer served in lean breast pieces. The pieces are very fatty and mixed with dark meat- even the sauce doesn't taste the same- very disappointing. I have stopped coming here as often because of it but their sushi is still A1!"}
{"text":"Finally!  

Toronto is plagued with mediocre sushi restaurants and they keep popping up everywhere!    Former favourites have gone down hill are closed or are now all you can eat.  

Tried a fried 'Fire' maki roll and salmon sashimi (plain I know - but I was rushed to order.)    Quality of both items were great in quality, taste & presentation.   

Servers were quick, courteous and knowledgeable... and initially when my server thought I hasn't had sushi before, her approach to explaining the difference between a maki / hand roll & sashimi didn't make me feel like an idiot. 

The chefs seem to be Korean and I don't think they make their own soy sauce.   For the price, it's good value.   It's slightly more expensive than the run of the mill sushi restaurant, but the quality is there and you won't be disappointed. 

I only wish I lived closer to the place!     I will be getting the Chirashi next time!
