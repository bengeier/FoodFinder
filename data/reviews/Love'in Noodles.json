{"text":"This place reopened and they have rebranded themselves as a Szechuan skewer hotpot place. However they still have management problems. First of all the service is extremely slow. For an all you can eat hot pot this is the slowest place in Toronto. The soup base tastes good. However they don't have enough materials. I wasn't really sure whether they were slow so that customers don't eat or whether they were slow because they were running out if materials as they weren't cooking anything. For all the effort they used to rebrand this place and advertise it as the only Szechuan skewer hotpot it was extremely disappointment and pricy. Everything that other places offered as part of all you can eat they charged extras. We never received everything we ordered. Stay away."}
{"text":"We had the beef noodle and tomato noodle soup.

Quantity - Their small size is actually quite enough as it's the same size as a ramen noodle at Sansotei or Kinton.  For it's quantity, it's quite decent

Quality - The beef noodle was disappointing as the broth was really bland.  The turnip in the noodle was disappointing as well.  However, the tomato noodle was actually quite flavorful.

Service - Since we were one of the few customers there, the service was okay."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch, and tried it out with someone. It is one of the many noodles places that have popped up in Toronto the last few years. Now This restaurant is very focused on noodles and snacks. we tried multiple snacks and noodles. and i have to say that this restaurant is average at best. Although heard a lot of hype around it before i went. it was nothing exceptional. The beef noodle soup was nothing exceptional. the beef brisket was in fact kind of rough. the portions for the shredded chicken was above all else very small. and the taste was nothing exceptional. The chicken cutlet was also very small for the price you got. the flavour of it is it tried to be a fried chicken cutlet stick. howevr the chicken was so thin you can barely tell it was chicken. 

This restaurant overall was nothing exceptional and i would not go out of my way to try it. however it is serviceable for those who crave those type of food, and is in the area."}
{"text":"It's a pretty new place and I pass by all the time, so I wanted to give it a shot. 7:15pm on a Friday night, no customers at all. That was alright, I wasn't going to let that tell me anything. 
The lady with very poor English asked me noodle or hot pot, so I chose the noodle menu (the name of the place IS lovin' noodle after all). There were very little selections. I would say maybe around 10 noodle selections. Options were not very impressive either. My two friends ended up ordering the same thing because they didn't want anything spicy and well, there wasn't much of a choice left after that.
The food took quite some time to come out. My noodle was only warm, not hot, so the fresh bean sprouts wouldn't even cook itself in the soup. The soup base was a spicy and sour flavour, but couldnt really taste the spice. It was sour, but also incredibly salty. I wasn't full or satisfied at all after finishing. Almost 8 o'clock, we get the bill to pay and finally two other people walk in (there were no other customers the entire time we were eating). So sad.
My stomach was acting up all night long and so did my friend's. I wouldn't give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I went this restaurant twice, one time for noodle and the other time was for hot pot. 

I would say their noodle was barely average at best. the noodle was not handmade and the soup was just full of artificial flavour. we also ordered some snacks with the noodle but neither of them was impressive. 

the second time i went there for the chongqing style hotpot which food were cooked on skewer in the pot. the soup base was very plain and i had sever question of their hygiene. me and my friend had a order of lettuce. we found the lettuce was completely dry and there was soil on multiple lettuces, which meant they did not even bother washing the vegetable!
 
after all, I would not  recommend this place to my friends, and I would never went there again."}
{"text":"Love'in Noodle is another noodle focus restaurant that open up in the area.

You better loves noodles as there is no other choice but noodles and maybe some side dish to go with your noodles.

Interesting items including Vegetable Noodles that made with pumpkin, spinach and even dragon fruit. But since this is my first visit, I ended up ordering my favourite, an item that has 3 chili rating by it's side. Szechuan Spicy Noodle Soup ($6.99)  ????.

Portion size was great for a small. The Signature Spicy Broth has an undertone of sweetness with just a medium level of spiciness. But overall quite satisfactory. 

Teriyaki Squid Skewer ($1.99) was tender but seriously lack seasonings.

Service was really friendly and attentive. Sadly I could not speak or understand that much Mandarin when the staff asked me what I think of the food. But good effort from the Management for new business.

{"text":"i got the spinach noodles, they were very chewy.  i assume it was home made.  It was very \"meh\"  nothing special.  I also tried their braised beef noodle soup.  that one was a fail.  The beef looked almost like pork.  it was so dry and chewy it looked like they just boiled it when i ordered.  If you go to other places that make it good you would understand that the beef has to be slow cooked for a long time for the flavour to infuse and for the meat to be tender.  This place was opposite.   Service was not bad.  

TIP for the business:  you need to put a menu outside ... i saw couple of people including myself stare in trying to figure out what kind of noodle place this is."}
