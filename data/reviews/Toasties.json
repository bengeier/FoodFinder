{"text":"Best sub joint in the west period, here's why:
1. They have the best bread
2. Best choice of toppings
3. Best sauces
4. Even they way they wrap the subs is amazing
The location is wtv but they offer delivery... although there's always sports on their two big screen tvs to keep you busy while you wait and all the staff there are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Good service but the sub was skimpy on the meat in comparison to most other sub joints and the cold cuts were mediocre grade. I like the way they toast the subs - VERY crunchy."}
{"text":"I'll separate this in 5 points that will clear out the whole \"Should I give this a shot or nah?\":

1. Best and freshest toppings.
2. Best bread.
3. Friendly service.
4. Best prices.
5. Best sauces.

There is literally no reason whatsoever not to go here instead of Subways or Quiznos. This place is superior to the latter two in every single way possible. This is honestly the best place to grab a meal in the whole West Island (not that we have much competition or anything).

The staff is very friendly, the place is clean and open almost all day long, there's plenty of seating, etc. It's a simple store that makes subs and it does it very very well.

P.S. Try the \"Toasties sauce\" and dip your sub into it like a proud lil' fatty. Just do it. I tried and I became a better human being."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sandwich I've had in a long time. The bread is legit, soft warm and crunchy, fresh ingredients, bomb sauces...had one this morning and already craving another for supper!"}
{"text":"Toasties has perfected the sandwich. The bread is slowly toasted and it comes out perfectly crisp yet soft. The toppings are fresh and the preset combos are creative and fun to choose from. I ordered the Pizza Sub and it was so good! The service is very friendly and the environment is clean and updated. It's a West Island gem."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp I had to give Toasties a try. No doubt about it, best subs that I've had in Montreal. Great choices. Great bread. Phenomenal dressings! One of us had a salad and said it was also really good. My new go to for subs on the West Island."}
{"text":"No reason not to give out 5 stars, these guys make real decent subs and take pride in doing it. Menu has some expected standards and a few interesting variations. I had the Italian and added extra meat. It might have been lean without but it would still be a decent sub. The Philly looks good, maybe next time. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love their original menu and the concept, great service and delicious sandwiches, will definitely go back and recommend :)"}
{"text":"The subs at toasties are the best. I mean WOW. they are fantastic. The way they put the sauce on the sub, the pickles and the way they marinate the chicken is so sexy. The food tastes good. The service is good. Love it. Most people would give it 2/10 or 5/10 but i'm giving it a 10/10."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches..stopped here twice during weekend as we were in area for a hockey tournament.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great subs. I have been going there every so often for years. Quick service and fresh food. Same guys working there for years who care about their product."}
{"text":"This is something I would never think would happen, A 5 star review from me. At first when I saw the other reviews I thought it can't be that good that every one gives it 5 stars until I tried it. I Took the Philly cheese steak. I would of taken a pic but when I stared eating it I could not stop and befor I knew it was gone! The bread is perfectly toasted, all the veggies taste fresh and you probably won't find better for the price. First 5 star from me for a reason."}
