{"text":"Great new restaurant. I had the mussels and crab stuffed mushrooms...both were delicious. Then I ordered a slice of pie that was large, tasty, and only $3. Friends got various pasta dishes and were very happy with the food and portions. Servers were attentive and kind. Manager was checking on tables and making sure everyone was happy."}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Great wings and all the food. People very nice. Stop in Thursday and play with the band. Or Saturday and listen to the band. Looking for nice this place is just that!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out after going to it's predecessor, Anthony's, for years. They've redesigned the interior so it's much more open and welcoming with more natural light coming in. The have a pretty big deck out back and the restrooms were clean. While I was there the staff was very nice and helped us right away. As far as the menu goes, I wish they had healthier options but otherwise, what my friend and I ate was pretty good. We did notice they only had 3 beers on draft, 2 of which were run of the mill domestic types. I'd probably suggest a wider variety to choose from, especially with so many local breweries around.  Still, seems like a cool place to grab a bite & a brew with nice folks."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice, not the brightest bulb in the bunch, but will get the job done.  Salad wasn't fresh and crispy, which leads to questioning the rest of the food.  Lobster bisque was more like a tomato soup with chunks of what some might call a lobster.  It was clean and remodeled inside, but the dishes and silverware are old, like come on are you serious ?  For the price and the hype, try other options."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Service is spotty on! I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and great service.  Everything we had was delicious. Our new favorite Parma restaurant."}
