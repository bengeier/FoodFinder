{"text":"Awesome. As always been.  Need anything special ask for Jaime  the Chef.  If you are a vegetarian its a plus. He can make some amazing exceptions."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for our first time and we loved this place! We definitely intend to make this a regular occasion. The big red flight was delicious... That zin!! Bruschetta was awesome. Crispy with a really flavorful and fresh topping. Fries were super yum. The charcuterie board was delicious and had all sorts of fun things on it. Service was awesome, and I just loved the vibe! Will be back. A lot."}
{"text":"Stopped by here around 10 on Saturday. It was a little quieter than some of the surrounding bars but that was nice for our group of 4. we could actually hear each other talk. Our waitress came immediately over and suggested some great wines. I had the Big Red Wine Flight - It was fantastic and on a late night SATURDAY happy hour no less. The 2 guy band were absolutely phenomenal. I would travel to hear them again. They did cool covers of a variety of songs. There was even a request book the waitress provided if you wanted to suggest a song. One of my group ordered the super delicious grilled cheese bites. I would come back just for those!  I also want to try the patio but it was still just a little warm. . Overall - great atmosphere, superb wine selection, incredible music + HAPPY HOUR! What wasn't to love."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My boyfriend and I discovered it a year ago and we love to come here for date nights and happy hours. It's a great place to start your night off if you're looking for a more relaxed vibe. They sometimes have live acoustic music which sets a great ambiance. They have games you can play at your table which was a blast. I cried laughing playing Cards Against Humanity here when my family came in town. 

The food is delicious and reasonably priced. It's not a great place for getting a large sit down meal, the food is generally smaller plates like bruschetta and meat and cheese boards. I love all of the grilled cheese sandwich options! 

I know very little about wine.. But I always enjoy the selections. And it is so reasonably priced, it's tough to beat! 

So why 4 stars instead of 5? The last time we went in we learned there was a new owner and saw that they have switched it to a hookah bar.. I'm sooo sad about this. I have nothing against hookah bars but it definitely changes the feel of the restaurant. I loved the ambiance so much! Add hookah and you go from a cute intimate wine bar to a hookah bar and nothing else. I'm worried that the Toasted Cork will turn into that. 

Overall, I love this restaurant/bar and I would recommend it to anyone! But not if it fully transitions into a hookah bar."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation in Scottsdale. Arrived at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday night hoping the kitchen was still open and YES it is open till 12 AM! The place has nice hip music playing in the background and a half table/booth we sat at. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 flights of red wines and bruschetta, wings, and on Tuesdays you get a free panini with purchase of a drink! The food was DELICIOUS, along with the wines they handpicked for us! Service was spot on, and the owner gave us this mamma mango moscato for our last tasting and it was PERFECT for dessert. Can't wait to go out and buy a bottle! Thank you Toasted Cork for making our last night of our Scottsdale vacation AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 6pm and they were closed. Their website says 1pm-10pm on Sundays, no signs were posted at all. we were very disappointed, not sure if well go back because I'm not impressed by how they run their business."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ten stars, I would!  I visited the Toasted Cork last Friday evening on a bachelorette party.   The evening started by sitting at a table with custom menus that had the bride to-be's name printed at the bottom.  I literally only called to reserve a table the week before and only mentioned the bachelorette's name, and bam, printed custom menus free of charge!  

Then, the owner brought out two bottles of champagne and toasted to us gals!  The food was just as great as the service!  The wings and truffle fries were our favorite!

The owner was fantastic and so welcoming!  My parents own a bar in Cabo, so I'm a stickler for \"little things,\" which the Toasted Cork has nailed!

I wish I lived in AZ as I would definitely be a frequent visitor!  

AMAZING PLACE, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"It's my gf's bday and all she wanted was a brownie! So I called ahead to see if they had brownies and the manager said no, but he would get her one! This place is amazing! Great food, wine, and music. Our waitress Kylie was perfect. We'll be back SOON!!!!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend saw this place listed on groupon and it was a great deal so he bought it. 

He got the red wine flight and I got the white. I definitely enjoyed the white wines better but... The white wines are paired with a champagne and the red wines are paired with a port. By far my favorite was the port but I have a different taste than most. Love those sweet desert wines/drinks. But overall all the wines were great. 

The food... Oh my gosh... Delicious! We ordered the grilled cheese bites, cheese board, hummus, and a bruschetta. All items were reasonably priced and the portions were perfect. 

The wait staff was pleasant and eager to our needs. Love the feel of the restaurant, great ambience. Loved the lighting with the mini candles and corks. Cute twist. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon to try this place out. Great service and atmosphere. The groupon included a wine flight and bruschetta. Presentation and taste was great, after using the groupon we continued to have  a couple more glasses of wine and then capped it off with the toasted smores which were awesome. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has delicious grilled cheeses samiches. Toasted Cork has professional service and when you order it comes fast!"}
{"text":"I came here recently with my moms & this place far exceeded my expectations! The atmosphere was cute and the service was very attentive. Robbie & Chris behind the bar were great! Wonderful recommendations for drinks and their grilled cheese sandwiches were to die for. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Old Town. There is a really great atmosphere and this is a great place to enjoy some great wines or craft beers after work or in the evening on the weekends. Not to mention, Michael is super knowledgeable about his products and can help anyone find something to fit their palette.

My husband and I kept seeing this place when it first opened up and decided to stop in. To our pleasant surprise it was happy hour, and the happy hour there is amazing! Grilled cheese is unreal, the butcher block is hands down my favorite appetizer item, and the smores bites are so yummy!

I am not sure when they have live music but every time I have been there in the evenings there has been live musicians and they have all been really great. It brings a coffee house feel to a wine bar. Everyone should stop in!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend. This hidden gem in Old Town is a great break from the typical Scottsdale sports bars. Great date spot or night out with the girls. I had the Glazed and Confused grilled cheese and the sangria (which is amazing)!!! Definitely will be back. Plus the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent wine, live music, friendly staff very attentive!  Cozy atmosphere and not big  portions which I loved. I'll return!"}
{"text":"Good wine selection. . Good food.. chef should saute the mushrooms on the millionaire. . Otherwise nice place and a great happy hour! Owner Michael is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Favorite Part: Wine List!
Second Favorite: View from the upstairs patio

The Toasted Cork not only has a great wine list, but the upstairs patio is the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine with girlfriends or on a date. Love the Butcher Board with cheese and meat. 

Definitely recommend for happy hour! They have awesome $5 specials! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour on Friday night, not impressed.  Ordered Bruscetti and we got 5 teeny pieces of bread with some balsamic vinegar and tomatoes on top, it wasn't worth the $5. Definately won't go back."}
{"text":"Meh. 

The place is cute I'm sure I could have a better experience but I'm not going to go back. The waiter forgot my wine refill, so I had to ask twice. Then my friends ordered the bruschetta that was very small and not worth the $12. I had ordered a grilled cheese and the waiter forgot that as well. He offered to bring it for me and I declined. I would have been more understanding if the place was busy but it was pretty much empty. So needless to say don't waste your time."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always looking for new happy hours to try and we decided to give The Toasted a Cork a try given that they advertised via a Groupon.  As others have said, the atmosphere is very forward but too \"dark\" for my personal liking.  

This evening, there was three individuals to assist the customers of which one was behind the bar.  Service was slow in terms of drinks, food or water refills to our table.  The place was not empty but at the same time, there were 6 tables and 3/4 of the bar seats were utilized.  

In terms of the food, very good once it arrived to our table and was spot on in terms of quality and warmth.  

Overall, the service is the reason for only three stars as it was slow our entire stay."}
{"text":"The Toasted Cork is a quintessential hip and trendy eatery. Great ambience and service. Food .. Delish!!! Head Chef Jaime has out done himself!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey and iffy selection (they were out of turkey for the paninis when I went and they asked if they could sub in ham. Um, no, ham does not go well with pesto. I changed the order to a Cubano--a sandwich made with ham--instead.). 

BUT. 

The owner was aware that service was iffy and the kitchen was not turning food around quickly at all, so he comped our table with a free round of sparkling wine. Thanks, Michael, that was nice. And we'll be back. 

Another star for the drinks--I had a Pear Nectar (I think), and my first-ever Manhattan, and the drinks were nicely-mixed. Good job, bartender. Really. 

Final note: if you're ordering during happy hour, watch your bill. I was overcharged $5 (on a $25 total) and had to have the bill redone."}
{"text":"Mediocre service.  Limited wine and food selection. Sat up on the patio which was deserted at the time and felt we were being an inconvenience to the staff.  We were told about the happy hour prices on a Sunday afternoon and then charged regular prices by the same person who took our order.  Took a while to figure it out and get the bill corrected.  Too many other really cool places to spend my money.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"So it's probably bad luck on our part, but it felt like the entire kitchen staff quit as we showed up. So, a pro tip for when your kitchen staff quits: check for drink orders often. This was not our experience. The staff was understanding that we needed to leave and didn't make a stink about us not wanting to pay for the food we ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a groupon for a wine flight. We ended up staying all night. It was the absolute best service and best night! Amazing staff and nice patrons, the owner is the nicest guy. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! After a long drive from Vegas I just wanted a good glass of wine and some nibbles. And boy did this place deliver! 

We were greeted by the owner and a bartender. Although there were several other people there, we were treated like VIPs. 

I ordered the red wine flight, Parmesan Truffle fries and the Grilled Cheese bites. The wine was fantastic! Exactly what I needed. The fries had an awesome balsamic drizzle on top with a dipping sauce on the side. I ate every bite! And the Grilled Cheese bites?! Forget about it! The bread was toasted to perfection and the flavors were perfect. 

My husband had the Chicken Club Panini and just devoured it. He said it was incredible. 

This place will be a regular stop for every Scottsdale trip from now on!!!"}
{"text":"I had attended a work event here and this place was nice a little small but they had a live singer that night and only did appetizers but they were good nice place for a date night"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, very nice people! The peach mule was awesome. The food was not as impressive. If you go, get a grilled cheese, they're good! The bruschetta was not impressive-it was very much a quality l could have made at home, the bread is just slices of baguette with some stuff piled on top...a disappointing food experience."}
{"text":"I ordered The Dutch sandwich & the Caesar Wedge. The sandwich was good, & I'd order it again. The main problem was the salad. The menu said it's made with organic romaine. When the salad arrived it was made with iceberg lettuce. I'm not a fan of iceberg lettuce, & I would certainly never pay $8 for a salad made with iceberg lettuce.

Frankly, I'm turned off to The Toasted Cork. Don't switch from what's on your menu with cheaper, substandard ingredients. It's dishonest. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Came in here on my day off and I had the best sandwich in the world. The Cubano with tomato soup to dip, it was amazing. Service was good and very knowledgeable about the wines. They also made a pear flower. Sooooo good. Definitely a must"}
{"text":"First time here. Happy hour with a friend. Super cute place! Intimate date place for couples or a core group of friends. Good wine selection and great selection of different grilled cheese sandwiches! Acoustic guitar player set the mood! First time check in on Yelp gave a 15% discount."}
{"text":"The Cork wasn't popping on a recent Tuesday night, but that was a good thing as we had most of the upper deck to ourselves to enjoy the nice evening. Promotions always draw me into establishments and the buy a drink (not beer), get a free Paninni deal was the ticket.. The chicken salad version received good marks, but the quality of turkey used in the bird version (cheese, pesto, tomatoes) left a bit to be desired. Both sandwiches are served with bagged Kettle chips that are doctored up in the kitchen. The bartender/waitress was nice and gave me a few good wine suggestions as I just assumed that the higher the wine price, the better the wine (not the case). 
The Cork has alot of real estate to roam and there are also three nice sized TV sets on the upper patio for viewing. Will be back for Happy Hour or wine tasting."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!! If I could give them ZERO stars I would!!!! We decided to have our engagement party there since it's the place that we met. We were promised a variety of foods that would be brought out in spurts (to accommodate people arriving at different times) yet when when we got there the 8-10 plates of brushetta & grilled cheese sandwiches were on the table with 2 plates of tater tots with some sort of nacho cheese and siracha sauce on them!! The owner, Michael, whom I discussed the arrangements with had said there would be butchers boards & some wings served throughout as well as the brushetta and the 1st round of our guests drinks were included.  We never received any other food and all of our 25 guests paid there own tabs .... all for $250! After I left the owner a voice mail with my concerns.. he called me stating he wanted to rectify the situation as he had been out of town for the event while I was at work and was supposed to call back but, of course, never did.  I see why they are having to do Groupons & coupon deals to try to stay in business! Now i can see why the place is always empty! Never Again!!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and sat at the bar. There weren't that many people there, but I don't understand why because I love the toasted cork!

Chanda (like panda) was our bartender and she was amazing. We chatted with her all evening. She made us an amazing shot that tasted like horchatta! 

The bites (only $5) we got were the caprese, bourbon wings, and the avocado toast. I make my own cheese, so I know my cheese, and the mozzarella in the caprese was so good it melts in your mouth. The avocado toast was topped with a mound of delicious avocado. The wings were great, although they come with ranch not blue cheese. 

There was live music and the singer was really great. 

I totally recommend this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"We are definitely coming back! We had a great time thanks to the bar tender Robbie who took awesome care of us! Chris was also amazing and they both took time to make sure we were enjoying ourselves! Wine and food were delicious and thanks to Robbie our experience was fantastic! This place is a must do!!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place. Came here on a date for wine tasting and couldn't have a had a better experience. Chatted with the owner Michael and he did an amazing job helping us try new wines. Had a few of the appetizers as well and they were outstanding. Can't wait to come back and bring friends. Stop reading this and go already!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We usually go to Eddies or Dakota, but we wanted a change and I'm so glad we did. We stopped in last week while they were having a wine tasting event, they had music and the environment was relaxing. We sat at the bar and the service was great. The bartender was attentive to our needs and helped us with the menu since it was our first time. The wine was excellent we both ordered 2 glasses a piece, next time we will do a bottle and the food was excellent, the hummus plate was one of the best I have ever had. We will be back soon, especially knowing they have music a few nights a week is a bonus. This place was so good we might have this spot be our regular hang out."}
{"text":"Adorable place, close to the ballpark, excellent wine list with great happy and reverse happy hour specials! A special spot we will return to next time we are in the Valley."}
{"text":"I love this hookah lounge it's much bigger than the other ones in this area !! If you are trying to chill and have a nice night with friends come here!! They have a fully stocked bar what's better than relaxing and laughing with friends over drinks and hookah!! Great place!! I'll always be a regular!!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out one afternoon while we were staying in Old Town Scottsdale.  We saw this place while walking around and it seemed like a place that we would love - a wine bar with a cool vibe.  We stopped in and cooled off to enjoy a nice glass of wine.  They were still trying to figure out their identity, but hope it works out."}
{"text":"First time in, they just opened and we have already fallen in love! Wine bar but they serve everything, amazing food, fun crowd and fantastic service. We met the owner, very personable and even gave us a tour of the place. Great dining area and a better patio area, we will be spending many a foreseeable weekend here!"}
{"text":"I love the toasted cork! I went for my roommate's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice dinner. It would also be cute for a date. The red wine flights are really good. They have a pretty decent selection and everyone seemed to be happy. The main reason we went to this particular wine bar was the grilled cheese sandwiches. At first glance, they don't seem the obvious choice to pair with wine, but they are fantastic! It's seriously the best, especially because you can build your own! You just have to ask about it. The truffle fries are also delicious. I love that there is live music, but it really should be quieter. It's not a club, it's a small restaurant, so I shouldn't have to shout to talk over the dinner table. Also, the service could've been a little quicker, given that it wasn't crowded at all when we were there. But all in all, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a really nice, quiet Monday night here. The place was almost empty, but it only formally opened about 10 days ago and it was a Monday night. Had a Groupon for two wine flights and bruschetta. My boyfriend and I shared two red wine flights - generous pours so we both got to try several sips of each wine, plus a nice plate of crispy traditional tomato bruschetta. We also had the Monday evening special - order a glass of wine (or other drink) and get a Panini with chips for free. Great deal. I had the Cubano, which needed a little more of a boost from the mustard and pickles. We also shared the cute smores dessert - little graham crackers with chocolate morsels and a toasted marshmallow on top.  The service was great, the owner is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about wine. A very good by-the-glass list, which the owner continues to tweak to offer a good variety of wines at (fairly) reasonable prices. This is a very polished good-sized space, with booths, tables, a good-sized bar and a nice patio upstairs. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was craving oysters and saw that this place had them on the menu. Not only was I elated that it was happy hour and the oysters were just $1/per but they were also delicious! We also ordered the avocado toasts, yummy but exactly what you're expecting (no WOW factor) and had a couple of drinks (the Huckleberry Lemonade was not too sweet and perfectly refreshing). We loved sitting up on the patio enjoying the beautiful day. Definitely recommend checking this new spot out."}
{"text":"I was -so- pleasantly surprised by this place!! We went here on a whim when our planned restaurant had an hour wait, and were so glad we stumbled onto it! When we arrived, the downstairs was rented out for a bat mitzvah, and we were welcomed to the upstairs, outdoor seating, which offered a pretty view of Old Town. We used a groupon to purchase two wine flights and a bruschetta, which did not disappoint! Because we were there for dinner, we added in another appetizer of parmesean truffle fries which were out of this WORLD and a panini each.

We were blown away by the appetizers, and thought the paninis were really good, though they were definitely more suited to lunch or happy hour. The chips that came with them were pretty greasy for our tastes, but we had the fries, which were again, amazing, so we were happy to munch on those instead! Service was polite and prompt, and the waitress was quick with our check when we told her we were headed to a movie. We're definitely looking forward to coming back for happy hour and trying some of those $1 oysters... and, of course, more truffle fries!!!

My only wish for this place would be a few entrees that are a bit more substantial... you've made an excellent lunch / happy hour menu, but we'd have loved to see a few options that were more meal-like. Still, loved it!"}
{"text":"Adorable place! Went there with a friend using a Groupon. The wine flights are well put together and the bruschetta boards are fantastic. The ambiance was very classy and there was live music! Perfect place for a date, girls night, entertaining out-of-town visitors, etc. I'll definitely be going back to this place frequently! 

There is a huge outdoor patio and its centrally located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food, grilled cheese is a must. Best patio in Scottsdale. Their Sangria was my favorite. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Met the owner Mike during our first visit here. Great specials during the week and on Sunday with 1/2 price bottles of wine! 
They also have a nice selection of food too for snacking or lunch. Prices range about $8-$10 for \"shareables\" like cheese plates, hummus, fries etc.  
They have a patio too, on both floors, that should be great later in the day when it cools off. It faces to the west so it'll be a little to toasty in high afternoon but early afternoon or early evening after the sun goes down would be nice.
I think the room upstairs with the attached deck patio would make a great private party spot... can easily accommodate 50-75 people. 
They also have craft beers if wine isn't your cup of tea... and mixed drinks too - they've got a full bar. The wait staff was all very polite to our group. 
I'll definitely keep this place in mind as a great go-to when in the downtown Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went on a date at the Toasted Cork  last night and had such a wonderful evening! It was our first time dining there and I could not say better things about it. The ambiance, our waiter, the live music, the food, etc. 

The musician took my odd request - he said he'd never played it before (I requested 'Hey Ya' by Outkast) and a few minutes later, we were jamming out at our table! He rocked it! Our waiter was attentive, but wasn't towering over us all night. It was just the right amount. Their wine flights are such a great idea - and delicious! It was lovely to try all those different types of wine. When we were finished with our drinks, the manager even sent us over 2 glasses of white wine to try on the house. 

Our new favorite place! We'll definitely be back - and often!"}
{"text":"This used to be a club I'm sure and it wasn't a good one.

We purchased a groupon and were told we needed to make reservations. Defiantly not needed, there were more staff in the joint than customers.

The service was friendly and quick, but they didn't seem very knowledgable.

The reason why I am only giving two stars is the description for the wines did not at all match the wines that they brought us. The first two were fine, but both of our third wines were undrinkable. They tasted like they had gone bad, that really alcoholic sour taste...gross. We told this to our waiter who just walked away and didn't say anything...weird.

Finally, we left a cash tip on the table, and redeemed out groupon. Our waiter chased after us and told us that we had to pay an additional 4 dollar service fee. I instantly regretted leaving that tip and half wanted to ask for it back.

I would not go there again.

Oh we also had the toasted bruschetta, which was a little burnt and nothing that tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! Love this place! The wine is great! Food is a 10! The service is even better! I would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. An overbearing Hefe/ Vegas smell is pumped through the AC, and the food selection is pretty slim. The tomato soup served with the grilled cheese was literally like Campbell's with a couple shreds of basil in it. It was also served in a ramekin, which was pretty odd. The grilled cheese was tasty though. The wine/ beer selection looked great and reasonably priced sans the Budweiser which I thought was a clever idea."}
{"text":"Stopped in here my gf's birthday and there were about 10 of us. We got there at 6pm on a Saturday so it was still happy hour. From the outside the building still looks like old dance clubs that it use to be but on the inside it does feel like a wine bar. I had a glass of wine and since my boyfriend doesn't really drink wine he had a mixed drink. He first ordered a vodka/tonic and they came back and said they  were out of tonic....I found that odd to be out of at a bar on a Saturday night so he went with a jack and coke instead. When they delivered the mixed drink the glasses are VERY small. I did enjoy my wine. We ordered some of the bruschetta and split a wedge salad since they were on HH still. I was pleased with the wedge and the bruschetta (the roasted red pepper was the best). We also checked in on Yelp and also received an additional 15% off our bill which was nice. 

I did also like there was two guys performing live music and it wasn't to loud like other wine bars in town and you could still carry on conversations with other people. 

I do hope it makes it just need to do something different with the outside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite, low key wine bars. I come back fairly often and witness how involved the owners are. I LOVE the wine flights they offer and they have some tasty little appetizers to boot.
To top it off, it is a great place for a party of 12 or so. They have games you can play (ahem... cards against humanity. Who doesn't love that???) and they have live music."}
{"text":"Y'all they have a page on their menu dedicated to GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES! This place is a must try! Their service is fantastic and the wine/food is all delicious. They have a lot of other options to choose from too. There was live music and when sitting outside they have heat lamps. I will be returning with friends for happy hour sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Just swung in for a couple quick drinks but super nice bartender!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming to this wine bar for their great drinks and small plates.  The owner is very attentive and always makes sure that we are well taken care of.  The local live music is a great touch and helps create a great vibe.  I would recommend this for date night, girls night out or even for a large group."}
{"text":"I went to The Toasted Cork last night for a very casual date night and this place was perfect for just that. The patio is nice and features candle-lit tables (it was too windy last night so no candles, but I bet it looks cool).

Food and drink prices are great for this type of place in Oldtown. The food was really good. Not great, but really good - and that's why it gets 4 stars and not 5.

I would suggest it as place to grab a few drinks and appetizers. The meals are simply salads and sandwiches, but the apps are solid. We shared the daily bruschetta ($8) and the Butcher's Block ($16).

I'll definitely go back soon and you should give it a shot too. It's kind of off the beaten path so I doubt it gets too crowded."}
{"text":"I really wasn't too impressed with this place.  It looks like a nightclub turned into a winebar.  The vibe just doesn't quite work for me.  The bar itself is really small although the upstairs patio may hold some promise when the weather is nice.  They did have a pretty good selection of wine and craft beer which works in their favor."}
{"text":"The bar tender that was on shift when we were in (Shaunda?)  was the most repulsive, unprofessional  server I have ever run into.  After shaking a martini and breaking a glass in the shaker then re-using the shaker before rinsing it out to the over heard conversations about how drunk she gets at work I will never be able to take step foor in this place again.  She continued conversation in front of us at the bar about how a coworker killed her self by overdosing the week prior.  I mean the list goes on and on with this lady. The only reason I even rated a 2 was because the food was decent.  The management should be ashamed to have an employee like her in their establishment."}
{"text":"Great spot, the owner did a great job with renovating this place and is super helpful in helping you with your wine picks.

A good date spot or night out with the girls.

Hands down, best wedge salad I have ever had- hot off the griddle bacon and an abundance of creamy, tangy dressing."}
{"text":"The service alone will have me return! The wine was delicious,  they even decant it. My water stayed full. I was down with the tunes, I'd like to check out their live music. The staff was friendly. The bruschetta was good and they were receptive of my honest opinion when asked. I hope to see it stick around."}
{"text":"Disorganized staff. Cocktail tasty but ridiculously small for 10 bucks. Incredibly loud given the relatively small size. Instead of the advertised live music we were \"entertained\" by the announcer for an Amex company party we had apparently become a part of (there is no separate room for private parties). The spicy tots were exactly what you'd expect--if they were made in a college dorm room. Bruschetta was fair at best. Didn't stay to try any of the grilled cheeses due to the lack of ambience. Giving two stars instead of only one because the staff, though somewhat clueless, was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this wine bar!!! We went here on a date night and the service was excellent as well as the atmosphere, music, and menu. Our waiter James was really nice and made sure we were well taken care of and so did the owner Michael. The owner was seen on the floor checking on tables and the service. He stopped to talk to us a couple of times and made sure our experience was superb! The decor is very cool, the prices are very reasonable, and the live music they had was really good! Highly suggest this as a fun place to get together with friends or as a date night! This is definitely a new gem in Old Town! Will most certainly be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Good food and drinks at a reasonable price. Live music was on point. Didn't get to check out the outdoor upstairs patio but looked like there was a decent TV selection as well."}
{"text":"The potential is there, but the food does not deliver the kind or quality that is required to compete in crowded old town Scottsdale. The happy hour bruschetta consisted of thinly cut bread with a hint of burnt taste dressed with a halfheartedly  prepared tomato basil mixture. We also order the glazed and confused grilled cheese which was actually pretty good, but again showed some signs of lacking effort. The ham resembled the deli cut found at your local grocer, and the potato chips side were mediocre. The pineapple and teriyaki glaze really saved the day. 

The prices were more than reasonable, but price alone will not keep customers coming back. The service was great which is one check mark on the positive side! Overall this will not be the worst dining experience you have ever had, but there are simply too many great choices in Scottsdale to keep you coming back regularly."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago with a friend to grab a couple of drinks, it was the first time for both of us.  

We stopped in on a Thursday night, & I liked that they had live music, but I didn't feel as though they had the best set up for the performer.  

I also liked the fact that they have daily specials, big plus for me when going out to local bars/restaurants.  

What I didn't care for was the food.  While they have a fairly limited menu to begin with, it was even more limited due to the fact their fryers were 'broken'.  Nearly half of the menu items we weren't able to order so I just ordered the O.G. Grilled cheese sandwich with the house seasoned chips (since fries were not available).  The grilled cheese lacked any gourmet aspect and the house seasoned chips were simply cheap store bought chips and sprinkled with pepper.  Both of which I can probably accomplish in my own kitchen for less than $9.00.

With that said, neither of us will probably head back to this establishment."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for happy hour and was not too impressed. First off, the food took longer than 40 minutes. We ordered truffle fries, wings and caprese salad. The truffle fries were cold and had a really oily taste to them. The wings were also cold and salty and the caprese salad was good, (You can't mess that up). BUt the plating didn't impress us. It came on a small round plate and just thrown together. We both ordered a cucumber cocktail which was great. So overall maybe I'll come for drinks but not so much the food. Nothing too special about this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cozy with a great atmosphere and terrific service. We were there for happy hour. Very good prices on a nice variety of wine by the glass and small plate food. 
The owner made a point of speaking to each group and making sure they were well taken care of. 
Overall, a very nice experience and we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"First time to Scottsdale. We tried the avocado toasts and the bruschetta... AMAZING!!! Great service, met the owner - super friendly. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"James our server was awesome! Live music, wine, craft beer, and small bites... what more can you ask for? A very unpretentious, yet sophisticated place. We had a charcuterie board and grilled cheese bites...
My boyfriend and I had a great time! We will definitely be back for their 7 day a week happy hour :)"}
{"text":"My boy friend and I have passed this place many times and we found a Groupon so we decided to try it. I will say basically every part of our experience was not good. 

Our server was actually a bartender, we knew this because he said 'I'm a bartender but someone called out of work so I guess I'll have to take care of you guys.' What a welcoming way to introduce yourself. I said I have a Groupon and his response was ~EYEROLL~ 'Of course you do....'  another welcoming way to be introduced to their establishment. I asked what the Groupon consisted of and he said it was the wine... and then says 'You're 21 right? Cause you look young as SHIT.' I thought that was extremely disrespectful. 

We ended up ordering wine flights to try. He put down the wine and I asked what they were and he said they go in order of the menu, and walked away. We didn't have menus in front of us... So we just drank the wine not knowing what it was. I will say the first two wines were good and the second wine taste a bit stale, like it had been open for a while. I would have told our server, but he never came back to check. 
 
They have many bruschetta options but for the Groupon you could only choose out of three of them. Kind of disappointing because I had my eye on one that wasn't an option. When the bruschetta came to our table I literally laughed. They are 5 stale Ritz crackers with garnish and too much olive oil. When we saw the food, we decided we were going to leave and eat a real dinner elsewhere. 

Our server never redeemed our Groupon Voucher so I am going to give it to someone as a gift. Most likely someone I don't like very much as a punishment :)

All in all, Postinos is opening down the street. Go there instead."}
{"text":"This place needs to advertise more because  I'd  no idea they  existed.  We came during happy hour and it was quiet and relaxed. Great patio overlooking a nook of Old Town.  We enjoyed a bottle and their $5 happy hour food specials.  

Amazing wings and a build your own grilled cheese?  okay!  I'm not sure why this wasn't more crowded because the service was excellent, good wine selection, and fantastic food with great HH specials!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and for just opening it was a great experience. Sat at the bar. The food, service and drinks were great. Definitley coming back."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this as I get they opened less then a month ago but I feel I owe people a time waster. I'm annoyed I spent close to two hours of my Tuesday night here tonight.  

The restaurant looks and feels like a Scottsdale club which is odd as they're advertising as a wine bar. We almost didn't go in but since we were already there we decided to give it a shot. They have a tiny bar, a DJ booth and a small amount of tables. Again, odd for a wine bar... They had 3 ppl behind the bar, one manager in a suit, one server and another guy in a red hoodie who I'm assuming is an owner cause he was walking around all night. The poor server was running with a large party and two other tables while everyone else seemed to be standing around oblivious to their surroundings. We watched as a table walked out after not being greeted for more than 10 minutes cause the server was figuring out the computer system. It was as if the manager and hoodie were above greeting their guests. 

Anyway, about the actual food. It took over 45-min to get our food which came out hot and rather tasty. We had the wings which were nice and meaty and two panini's. This sandwiches were good but nothing I'd come back for but they were a great deal as it was buy one drink get one free panini. 

Don't plan on returning unfortunately although I was excited about a new \"wine bar\" in town."}
{"text":"What a treat it was to walk into The Toasted Cork's wine bar after a long day shopping at Fashion Square! Greeted warmly, the place is hip and trendy with a relaxed atmosphere. Great happy hour (they actually have two a day), with a full bar and an extensive wine list. We tried the hummus appetizer and it was delicious. Served with cucumber slices, asparagus spears, broccoli, greek olives with slices of toasted baguette it was a perfect appetizer for two people. 

Just prior to my visit, they had a wine night  hosted by a California winery. Bottles were available for purchase and I found a new wine I love!   

There was plenty of seating areas to choose from... inside or outside, up or downstairs. With ample space, they can accommodate private events, big or small, with a DJ on site and a dance floor. What a great place for a bachelor/bachelorette party, office party, a family event, and can even accommodate Bar/Bat mitzvah parties! I was impressed. The building sits on the corner of Civic Center Plaza and E. 6th and from the large upstairs patio one has a great view.  

For a respite after shopping or after a hard day's work, The Toasted Cork is where I will return for drinks, good food and music."}
{"text":"Great date spot! Grilled cheese is awesome. Check out the patio upstairs. Service couldn't be better, nice change from \"typical\" Scottsdale. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hip! Went here last night and on Wednesday they have a special with select bottle of wines for 18 dollars. Of course I ordered the prosecco and it was delicious. I also ordered their only glass of moscato--I couldn't remember the brand but it was one of the best moscatos I've had. 

They serve \"appetizer\" type foods but everything we had was amazing. We ordered the torched bruschetta--the bread was toasted looking but kind of soft, I LOVE THAT! I hate when the bread is so hard you have a difficult time biting into it. The avocado dish was just like the bruschetta but with avocado and that was my favorite. The avocado was so fresh and it was tasty. The bourbon chicken wings were fantastic. It was a little spicy but not to the point where it was overbearing and they served about 8 pieces. At the end of the night we ordered smores. There were 7 tiny smores--the fanciest looking smores I've ever had! It was very aesthetically pleasing and pretty good too, but you just can't beat good ole regular smores done over a fire. 

Their happy hour is AMAZING. it's everyday from 4-7pm and there's a ton of great deals ($5 bites, $3 dollars off wine etc). If I lived near the area, I would make this place a regular stop after work or for a romantic evening on a weekly basis (it is quite dark in here so it's the perfect setting for a date night)."}
{"text":"First time here and was going to use a groupon but Robbie advised me it'd be cheaper to just go with the Friday special $10 wine flights and he was right. Robbie was a great guy, hilarious and cool to talk to. Great atmosphere and relaxing patio area."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago in my search for the best Phoenix happy hour. I probably would not come back. Nice atmosphere. We sat at the bar and the bartender had just started working behind the bar. And did really good for her first day. Large wine list. I sampled a few and struggled to find one I liked. My husband liked a Zin right away. Hes a lot less picky than me though... They did have a really nice bubbles list though. I maybe would consider coming back just for that. I ordered the happy hour brushetta. My husband got a grilled cheese. His grilled cheese came and and went and still no brushetta for me. However a person down a few seats that came in way later than me got hers right away. Sure enough the bartender said yeah she got your Brushetta. So another 15 mins later my Brushetta came. It was not even close to worth the wait. And it was cold. Maybe it was supposed to be. Who knows. I can easily forgive and forget about something like that with a little nudge. Like Hey I didnt put it on your bill. Or here have a glass of something on the house while you wait. But nope. Not a thing. Bad business. Got to make the customer happy. I had high hopes and I really wanted to love this place but would not go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now and I'm glad that I did. This place has a large menu of wines, brews, and cocktails. Their happy hour is definitely a steal and is everyday! 

Tried some of the flights and the butcher board. Very pleased with everything. They also have a large variety of grilled cheese or you can build your own gourmet grilled cheese. 

The owner was very nice and was found doing every role in the place. Everyone kept coming by to make sure that we were all set and if we needed anything. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So it started with watching the movie \"Chef\" when I got a craving for a cubanos.  Looked up this place on this app and decided to come here based on the reviews. A decision that I am glad to have made. The atmosphere of the place was awesome, the staff was great and attentive, and the music was an upbeat bonus.  Started the evening with the avocado bruschetta and continued the evening by Ordering from the build your sandwich, pairing the pretzel bun, pepper jack, turkey, salami, red peppers and artichokes. Was very delicious!  Finished the evening with an order of s'mores, which I think is a must!  I will definitely return and rather curious to see how this place is doing a couple months down the road... Good job!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the service here. We got a Groupon to try this restaurant out for 2 wine flights and a board of bruschetta. My hubby and I got a little dressed up, and were looking forward to a fun night in Scottsdale after our wine tasting. When we arrived, no one was there to greet us, so we stood awkwardly at the door for a few min. When the hostess came back, she was friendly and led us upstairs to sit down. (She was sweet, but asked us if we'd just come from prom?? We're in our mid-twenties haha!) We heard two of the employees joke that we were \"grouponers\" as we walked past...which was really strange and made it sound really condescending. Then, we waited at our table for at LEAST 15 minutes (maybe 20) before someone finally came by and asked us if we'd like waters. After another 10 minutes (and by this point we thought we'd decided on everything we wanted to order, and had picked out our 4 bruschetta choices) the waiter came by and just stood there! Didn't introduce himself, or ask us how our night was, or anything. It was so awkward! We explained that we had a groupon, and he quickly said that we only got a choice of one out of three bruschettas, instead of having a choice of the whole list. Which is ok, but would have been nice to know at the beginning so we didn't set our hearts on the other choices. We ordered our flights and our single bruschetta choice, and the bruschetta came out about 10 minutes later BEFORE the wine. It was all very strange and impersonal..our waiter didn't help us choose our flights or give any suggestions, and wasn't friendly at all. Not to mention, our candle went out on our table, and a waiter came around and lit everyone's candles that had blown out EXCEPT for ours haha! We are very easy going and sweet people, so it's not like we were being loud or rude. Instead of going out and exploring scottsdale after we were finally done, we just wanted to go home. It totally killed our mood for the night. (We still tipped about 18% because we're too nice haha!, but looking back, I wish we hadn't...)
I WOULD give it two stars (because the food that we did end up receiving was great, there was live music and he was great, and the wines were excellent) but the two stars on Yelp reviewing says \"I've experienced better, Meh\" and I don't think that it deserves that much because we're never going back. It was just a horrible atmosphere and the service was terrible. We were there for almost 2 hours, and the only things we ordered were our flights of wine (so three smaller glasses that came out all at once) 5 tiny pieces of bruschetta, and some grilled cheese sliders. I really had high hopes for this place and was really excited to try it out. I'm pretty upset with how our experience turned out and will not be recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! The music here is great! Def a cute wine date night place! The owner was super nice and great service!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service, great food, really reasonable prices, and not at all pretentious! The live music was a fun surprise too. Our fave was the build your own grilled cheese and toasted S'mores Trio. SO good! Nice that they had gluten free options for my fiancé too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night when there was live music. The owners (I assume) were both working and awesome, I could tell they had a lot going on with so many people in there, but did not lack on service. The guy playing the live music had the voice of an angel and totally killed it. My boyfriend and I both had the Malbec and got a glass of dessert wine on the house before we left. When I come back next time, I will definitely be ordering some of the food there, it ALL looked delicious from what other people had ordered around us. This location is awesome too, the patio is wonderful for this time of year!"}
{"text":"We live close by and so glad we came. Fantastic service and live music to boot.  They also have a tasting of sparkling wine right now.   My lucky day."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I just love this place. Very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The bartender, Sonya, and server, Simon, are awesome. The patio upstairs has a great view. I think there needs to be some plants or more decoration on the patio tho :)"}
{"text":"My rating is just based on the atmosphere alone as my husband and I didn't eat or drink here. We came in last night because we got invited to an event via Facebook. When we walked in, there were 2 waiters who were giggling and goofing off at the front door who didn't greet us, open the door, nothing. It was very odd and kind of rude. I ignored it and kept pushing on. When we walked in to the place, we stated we were there for the event and the hostess seemed extremely confused. We got put at the middle table and were just told to wait while they get everyone together. Everyone had a look of confusion on their face and their actions gave the same impression. We then were given menus and told all the specials for the day with no mention of a wine tasting event. It felt like the event was just a gimmick to get people in the door and really not what it was advertised for. This place could be really nice. Cool spot and the food looks good, but the staff need more training. We left before we ordered food/drinks because we were so uncomfortable. Also, the candles burning in the place were so strong that I couldn't imagine eating/drinking and experiencing the full flavor of the food/drinks. I might try this place again after a few months so they can get more experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were here this weekend to kick off our girls night.  I had purchased the wine flight for 4 groupon to try the place out.  We were all very impressed.  The flight selection is very good- we all went for the sparkling cause we like our bubbles!  We ordered a bunch of food to try:  brushetta, avocado toast, caprese, parmesan truffle fries, hot tots and s'mores.  Presentation was lovely and the food tasted amazing.  There wasn't a thing we didn't like.  The ambiance is very cool.  It was a Saturday night and they had a guy playing live acoustic music, which was really nice.  There aren't enough places in Old Town that have live music, so I thought that was a nice touch.  Great place to get your night kicked off, Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'll never ever ever ever be back... 


Great friends and awesome drinks... Until the bartender in an empty bar decided to tell to the whole place he won't separate tabs... (Wanted to make sure my girlfriend whose birthday it was wouldn't pay...) chased me down to continue his yelling as I walked away! 

Brought the wrong drink, took forever with food and is actually currently talking about how horrible I am behind the bar as I write this! 

Don't worry, I won't return"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom during Happy Hour thanks to a Groupon a purchased for her awhile back which included two wine tasting flights and a bruschetta board. Even without the Groupon, they have amazing happy hour deals!! They also have daily specials so check them out before heading in. Important to note that when you check in on Yelp you can get 15% of your bill!

I'd also suggest sitting out on their patio that overlooks downtown Scottsdale. It was a beautiful setting and the weather was great!

For the wine tasting flight, I went with the Sommelier's Pick and my mother went with the Big Reds. They give you great sized tastings! Enough to make you feel a little wobbly upon standing after the tastings. I loved the flight I chose as it offered a nice variety of wines both white and red. For the bruschetta board, we went with the Torched bruschetta. It's more along the lines of their \"basic\" bruschetta and was crunchy and savory from the tomatoes and cheese yet slightly sweet from the balsamic reduction that was drizzled over it. Great combo.

We also ordered the New York Grilled Cheese bites. A nice crunch on the bread mixed with gooey cheese....yes please! I also love to dip my grilled cheese in something so the fact that they provided a chipotle ranch with the mini grilled cheeses was awesome. 

I really want to try more of their bruschetta boards. My mother is kind of a picky eater so taking her out to eat can kill my yelping/foodie vibe sometimes. I want to try all the things!! The staff was very friendly and helpful in choosing items and wines."}
{"text":"Went to check out The Toasted Cork to support new local businesses. Glad I went. Monday was a little slow but the deal of free panni with a purchase of wine or drink. I love a good variety of red wines and Toasted Cork offered some good choices. A lovely Chianti, which sadly I don't see enough of on the wine scene. Of course there were your California Cabernet and South American Malbec, but since I  love Italian reds I recommend the Chianti. Met Mike the owner and he is very hospitabLe and made sure our table was taken care of, which reminds me of being back out easy with the  extra care. The panni was awesome and fresh. I got the  Turkey  Roma, but next I'll try the veggie. My friend had the truffle fries which they said were good. The atmosphere was perfect laid back and chill. Great progressive house music playing as a background,but still able to have a conversation. Definitely coming back and checking out how it is on a weekend."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for happy hour on a Saturday night (it's nice they have HH on Saturday). The space is cute and they had live music, which was fine. We only ordered cocktails, which were a decent deal on hh (6$ I think). First I tried a cocktail that had ginger, lime juice, pineapple, and a chili vodka.... I was unsure about it, but the bartender assured me it was good. Unfortunately, it was one of the most horrific drinks I have tried.... I could taste nothing but the chili vodka. I couldn't drink it and (after waiting a very long time trying to gain the attention of a staff member) I was able to trade it for a different drink, which was nice of them. I tried a drink that had a fig infused whiskey... it was much better, still not wonderful, but much better than the previous drink. Overall, the place was alright. I probably won't be running back, but I would have no issue going back if a friend invited me."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place at all. I had asked our server about one of their daily specials multiple times, because it didn't make sense. Come to find....we were told differently each time.

We went for their Happy hour....which kind of sucked. Their deals aren't really so great, and their food was definitely not anything worth mentioning. We did the Thursday night special of wine and bruschetta for $20. You have to be ready to be compared to the best place with this same deal. Toasted Cork didn't come close. Their bruschetta was just 5 small crackers.....more of an appetizer than a meal. Plus.....there were all these stipulations as to which wines you could choose from as well as the bruschetta. You could only choose from 3 different types of bruschetta. When they had maybe 6 or so available. 

Not a bad place, but I most likely won't be back....not worth my money."}
{"text":"They have amazing food and a great selection of wine. I came with a big group and we all sampled their different wine flights! Their red wine flight was my personal favorite. They also had amazing bruschetta."}
{"text":"Good food. Apparently the menu changes every week and isn't updated on yelp or the current menu. I tried to order sangria and cheesecake on the menu and was told they didn't have it. What do you have? Don't check the menu on yelp before you go because they won't have it."}
{"text":"Tapas weren't the most tasty, particularly for the price. Everything was rather bland and \"blah\", but I will happily say that the wine flight prices are excellent for the quality of wine and for the area. The waiter was very kind to offer us two flutes of champagne on the house, which were delicious."}
{"text":"I attended a charity event here last weekend and it is a beautiful venue that is great for all kinds of group events and it is also a great place for a date on the upstairs patio with great views of the sunset.  They have a great selection of wines and food. Regarding food my favorite is the Parmesan Truffle Fries."}
