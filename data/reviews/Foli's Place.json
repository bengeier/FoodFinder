{"text":"From what I can tell the kitchen is dirty, the cooks are frequently seen smoking (with their aprons on) in the back door.  I've seen potatoes and onions stored on the floor.  The food is mediocre at best and the service is equally bad. The only thing I've ever ordered that wasn't half bad was a burger, everything else I've tried was horrible.  Save your money and stay at home because there is literally no way you could make it worse than they did."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner. Specifically asked what type of lettuce came with the salad. Waitress was over confident that it was a medley of romaine,  iceberg, and mixed greens. But what i got in my gyro salad was nothing but iceberg and small dry pieces of chopped gyro masked with cheese and a few artichokes. When i pointed out to her that i was not happy, she said oh it's bcuz the iceberg are cut in bigger sizes then the other salads. I said it's all iceberg I'm the one eating. Very disappoint. $10-$11 for a small plate of iceberg. Won't be going back as i can get iceberg salad at the Drive thru at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The wraps and appetizers are delicious also! It might not look like much on the outside, but this place is a winner."}
{"text":"They have my favorite burgers in the East! But the last couple of times we ordered burgers the bun was hard, so it was a disappointment. Bummer. They don't have a huge beer selection, but they do have a cool selection, quality not quantity is what I always say (especially about beer)  Pizza has always been good."}
{"text":"Over priced, poor quality, and the staff was very unpleasant. Went to the bar to order a  couple beers for me and my date and if looks could kill well I would be dead. Wouldn't go there again if I got a free meal and bottomless beer for a week if I could give it no stars I would"}
{"text":"Called and asked what their hours were and they said 10pm.... Got there at 8pm to order and they said the kitchen was closed.... Complete BS!  *update: I had dinner with my family at Foli's and that was complete garbage! I wouldn't eat there even if i was a raccoon!  I had the chicken cheese steak hoagie for $8.95... No flavor at all... I asked for hot sauce to resurrect the sandwich and they brought me buffalo sauce... It basically tasted like bread with buffalo sauce... It felt like a POW...."}
{"text":"11/2/16 Update: Having nowhere else reasonably priced nearby, we have reluctantly eaten here a couple of more times. There's a new waitress we'd not seen previously. She's more polite than the other one we seemed stuck with all the time. She was the only waitress, and had several full tables, including a party of 11. As a result, our food was served cold, or missing key ingredients. My most recent Club sandwich had only 1 strip of bacon on the whole thing! More was brought after I asked for it, but its errors like this that stick in my mind. With one star, I may have been harsh in my last review, but when mediocrity is accepted by management, mediocre is the best I can give in my review."}
{"text":"Wasn't awful, wasn't great, either. The place has been closed for a few months now. No explanation as to why or if they're going to reopen."}
{"text":"Good pizza wings and beer after APFT and weigh in.  Local bar with fairly good bar offerings, pizza, wings, burgers, etc., nothing groundbreaking. The pizza and wings are very solid, just good solid basics.   my issue with Foli's is the price, for a local bar off the beaten path, they are very expensive. Beer is priced like you are at a hipster hangout in the South Side, and the pizza is exorbitantly  priced. For a single large pizza with two toppings you pay nearly $20.   The food is good, just I think overpriced for what you get, when I stop in my local bar, and have pizza and wings, and a couple of beers, a tab nearly $50 is kind of steep."}
{"text":"Great place with great people. I stopped here on my way into the Burgh to visit family and was happy to run into several old High School friends. This is a central location for Churchill, Forest Hills, Swissvale, and Edgewood folks.   The menu is pretty diverse for a neighborhood bar like this - there is your typical bar fare, but also a lot more healthy options that I didn't anticipate. They have legitimate cooks in the kitchen. I got a chicken sandwich and a beer. It came with French fries that were crispy the way I like them. The bread was good and the chicken was cooked perfectly with a healthy portion and some crisp lettuce and fresh tomato on it.   Guys like Scooter, David, and Sherbie hang out here and I dig that this place has become welcoming and open to everyone. There's no one that's not welcome here - except maybe the Douchebag named Disappointed D. that wrote a review on the lettuce in the salad? Where do these people come from - besides the fact that all of his reviews are negative. We need less people like him on here.   They have a nice selection of beers, pour a well made cocktail, and have about a good of a selection of wine that you'll find in any local spot. The ambiance is pleasant with TV's, a horseshoe bar, super friendly bartenders, and a good sized dining area. There's plenty of parking outside, and when I was here during a hot day at the end of summer, the A/C felt cool and comfortable.   Reasonably priced or extremely cheap compared to where I live! Great place for lunch or dinner, or grabbing some drinks with friends. Very Clean."}
