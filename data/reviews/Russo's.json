{"text":"The quality of the food is second to none.  Dave Russo and his team know how to make wonderful food, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  I've never had any food that wasn't very well prepared.  Try the chicken liver appetizer or a plate of oysters on the half shell :)

The service is *usually* good: when they're on their game no one does it better.  Sadly, when they get busy, the service slips perceptibly.  Also bear in mind that regulars get *much* better service than unfamiliar faces.

On the downside, even taking into account the very superior quality of the food and service, the prices are still on the high side.  Accordingly, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have not eaten here for a few years so we thought we'd give another try. Pleasantly surprised by food quality and service. Surf and turf was excellent. Linguine with shrimp, scallops, crab also good.  Great salads with house made dressings. I had blue cheese which was not the usual kind but more like a vinaigrette with lots of cheese crumbles. Husb had white French and loved it. We'll go back in a lot less time than 3 years."}
{"text":"This place is alway a great place for dinner. Amazing dinner, great atmosphere!
The menu is fresh daily. The food is fresh as well. The food theme is Italian/ New Orleans fusion, and chef Dave serves up an interesting dinner every night. 
Save room for their desserts, get the peanut butter pie."}
{"text":"Great corn dusted yellow perch!! Sitting at the bar and just about everything passing by looked delicious. My parents have always come here and one of the top restaurants in the Akron area."}
{"text":"We went to Russo's on Saturday and the place was packed.  Despite that, the service was great.  Jennifer was very attentive.  Russo's is our go to when we crave creole.  However, something was off on Saturday.  Ordered the Chicken Etouffee and it was cold and there was maybe a spoonful of rice on the plate.  My dinner companion ordered Jambalaya and enjoyed the meal.  This was the first disappointing experience I have had at this restaurant.  It is pretty pricey so I expect the meal to be more than decent.  Will go again, but the restaurant has slipped a notch on our list of favorites."}
{"text":"Russo's has been my favorite special occasion restaurant since it opened. I have consistently enjoyed fabulous meals. However, Friday, my friend order her standby when she doesn't find anything on the specials menu that she is interested in, country fried steak and mashed potatoes. When the server placed our plates on the table, I was shocked. \"Where are the mashed potatoes?\",they usually fill half the plate. Low and behold, they were tucked under the steak and amounted to about a forth of the usual serving size. I don't believe potatoes are so costly that shrinking the serving size to this degree is going to make a difference to the bottom line. I would have paid a little more to have the meal unchanged."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Atmosphere was great.  Loved the back bar area.  The issue was the food.  Server told us they were known for their pizza.  The salad ordered was browning and wilting.  It looked like they just dumped it out one of those bags from the grocery store.  The pizza came out severely undercooked.  Wet dough and unedible.  When we addressed with the server she said she would have them make us another.  All they did was space the pieces apart from the old pizza and put it back in the oven.  The result was burnt crust.  With the poor quality food and limited menu I will never go back which is a shame because the building and bar are great."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the delicious food. Russo's is my go-to restaurant for a flawless dining experience. I guess I can agree that it's not a quiet spot, but it is a reflection of how \"alive\" this place is! The ONLY downside it might have is that is really is not on the main drag, geographically but that's OK with me; makes it a bit easier to get in without a rezzie!"}
{"text":"Good thing they weren't busy because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for service or to even be acknowledged! Never even tried the food because after 7 minutes of sitting there & being ignored, we chose to leave . And that's with 3 servers and only one other table with patrons. Good luck during dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Cleveland/Akron restaurant!  Great food, very consistent.  Bartenders are always great.   If it is on the menu... Try it.   Only the Navajo tacos have been so so.  Everything else is outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I have already suggested this restaurant to friends. We had a fig and prosciutto appetizer that was delicious. My husband enjoyed twin filets prepared to perfection set atop homemade mashed potatoes with a rich streak house. I had the New Orleans BBQ shrimp and it was outstanding! The sauce was thick, peppery, and silky with more than enough for the garlic bread provided to dip in it. We took dessert home because we both finished our dinners and did not have room. The peanut butter pie was fabulous with just enough peanuts for crunch! We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Dunno. I'd like to give this place many stars, but I'd have to be able to try it. Beginning to think it's maybe a mirage -- this is the third time I've stopped by and it's closed."}
{"text":"This is a must visit every time I'm in the area. They never fail to deliver and I've eaten there at least a dozen times. My wife says the beef ravioli is the absolute best she's ever eaten. I wouldn't know because she won't even let me have a bite. Their mussel's are terrific and sopping up the sauce is a must."}
{"text":"Best and most consistent restaurant in Akron, never had a bad meal. Both the Italian and Cajun food is top notch. Had family in Louisiana and Russo's is definitely authentic and up to par"}
{"text":"If half stars were available this would get 3 1/2 from me. I am torn because the food was outstanding but the service was slow and the restaurant was extremely loud. For the prices of the food I figured people would be dressed a little nicer and the restaurant would be more of a semi-intimate setting and by this I mean quieter. This was not the case. I had a hard time hearing conversation from across the table. 

Our server was very nice but seemed to be a server of leisure. While every table she had was full she made conversation with each table which led to slower service. Thank goodness for the flowing good conversation at our table that didn't make us notice this too much. We actually opted out of dessert because we were afraid it would take forever.

The food we ordered however, was outstanding! We started with the Grilled Calamari and it was the best I have had in awhile. Since it was grilled there was no breaded coating and it was cooked perfectly. It was mixed with sauteed vegetables and balsamic. Also, you get a trio of free bread with olive oil for dipping. 

The waitress sold my boyfriend and I on the Shrimp and Grits- the grits were fabulous! I am very glad I ordered this dish. The flavor packed a punch and the shrimp were large and seasoned well. I even used the bread to soak up the extra sauce- my plate was clean! My dad ordered the Steak Pizzaiola alla Farinacci and said the flavors were delicious.

My suggestion for anyone trying to go here is to sit at the bar. You get to watch the kitchen in action and I would think you would get better service."}
{"text":"Le propriétaire a déverrouillé les saveurs de la cuisine de la Louisiane et présente ses interprétations créatives magnifiquement un vrai travail d'amour 

I've visited this restaurant twice in the last few weeks sitting at the far right side of the bar each time so I could interact with the chefs and watch them create the dishes I enjoyed while growing up in Louisiana. Like in most Louisiana kitchens you won't find any recipe cards, measuring cups or jarred sauces here, it's a pinch of this and a bit of that with each layer seasoned to taste during the entire cooking process. It was obvious from the first taste that these guys have learned their craft from the owner whom I'm told spent more than a decade cooking along side some of New Orleans' finest chefs. Not only are the dishes spectacular examples of authentic Louisiana cuisine with the complex textures and flavors, the presentations also reflect a high level of pride and professionalism, nothing is merely thrown together, there's an art to this style of cooking and you'll experience all of that here at Russo's.

The service at the bar is exceptional, I can't speak of the table service I've yet to experience it but I can appreciate the other reviews that are somewhat critical and I'm sure this isn't anything close to acceptable by the owner. If the food experience is great I sometimes can tolerate a certain level of poor service not that I agree with it but it's not a deal breaker for me and I usually show my level of satisfaction with the tip and a note on the credit card receipt.

Everything I've tried here has been very good - the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo with its rich dark roux is so addicting - the Shrimp Étouffée with a few extra dashes of hot sauce was very memorable and ranks very high on my list of favorites here - the Grill Smoked Pork Loin with red beans and rice, collards and hushpuppies was absolutely perfect and if you're into big portions good luck finishing this one. This is truly an exceptional restaurant and I'll return here anytime I'm in the area..."}
{"text":"Was hoping for more -- pretty much sums it up. Used the online booking thing and was called back (they left a message) to let me know that time wasn't available, but had some others. Called back within 5 minutes and was told could only sit at the bar and only if we came right away. This would have been fine, except for the fact that NO ONE was there when we got there and the restaurant didn't fill up for at least an hour after. Bartenders weren't particularly friendly, food was par and overpriced. One of those places where the description makes it sound super fancy and then when it comes out it's tuna salad with saltines in the plastic. Disappointing for my first time out without kids in a year. Won't return."}
{"text":"The real deal. Worth the ride. Gumbo was great. Stacked salad with heirloom tomatoes interspersed with fried green tomatoes was a keeper. Pork chop with collard greens and red beans and rice was superior.  

Wine list comprehensive and contemporary. Daily menu options. Good crowd present. On the pricey side but they deliver."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Unfortunately I took my family and we had to sit next to a young lady and a much older gentleman who she continually \"serviced\" with her hand. Long story short, management didn't care because \"they come in all the time\". I had to explain what backpage dot com was to my teenage daughter. Restaurant is a great location to take your hooker before going to the motel across the parking lot."}
{"text":"I thought I would never find a slightly upscale restaurant that delivers great Cajun flavors other than the super-casual Battiste & Dupree.  Well, ta-da, insert Russo's.  The Jambalaya was so freaking good.  Nice heat, lots of flavor.  The side salads with dinner, although served on a chilled plate, weren't that great. They are missing something.  The hubby ordered the filet which seriously was tender and quite arguably the best value on the menu at $17.99 when ravioli is $22.99.  Roasted garlic was on point and the broccoli appetizer was great. Nice wine selection. Service was attentive but definitely felt rushed at times. The open kitchen makes you appreciate the blood, sweat and tears that go into making awesome food.  Definitely make a reservation because you will need it.  Great dinner experience.  Now...time to polish off my Jambalaya leftovers!"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service...especially at the bar. Inattentive, clueless, rude, zero personality."}
{"text":"Food is good, Pricey.  
Atmosphere is good, Music related.  
Specials are horrible or non existent.  
They have \"Taco Night\" which a few friends and I went to. 
For \"Taco Night\" there are actually no specials except for $5 Margaritas and they way they offer it is shady, Here is what happened.

ME: Taco Night perfect what are your specials?
SERVER: $5 Margaritas
ME: You don't have specials on tacos for \"Taco Night\"?
SERVER: No just $5 Margaritas.
ME: OK Ill have a mango Margarita.

Later - 
Check comes, I was charged full price for the Margarita. ($9+)
ME: I ordered a Margarita and was charged full price?
SERVER: Oh Yeah, If you want the $5 Margarita you have to order THE $5 MARGARITA...

I guess my only advise would be to watch what you order and how you order it because they run the menu like a legal contract.  (A LOT of small print)

Very Shady in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good Cajun standards - everything is way over priced. Went to lounge for an app and wings and couple beers and the bill was $60, never again"}
{"text":"Went to Russo's with another couple for dinner on Saturday night 10/18. Had a 7:30 reservation and actually got seated when we arrived at 7:15. We have been many times before and always had a great meal. I love that they have a special menu each night although it's tough for a repeat of a favorite dish. 

Our waitress informed us that they were on their last soft shell crab for a dish on their special nightly menu and asked if we wanted that dish. It sounded good so I agreed to that. It seems though that they should order enough of the items to not run out on a busy weekend. It seemed to be the theme of the evening though. I love Russo's food but quite a few of my favorites were already out of for the evening. Hello chicken liver appetizer....ran out on a Saturday night? Really!?!?! 

Also on the downside is the dining room noise level. Very loud and hard to hear the conversation at our own table. Also I really object to the tv's with football games at what I consider a higher end restaurant. Sort of cheapens the experience that I paid $150.00 for two people. Bottom line 2 out of five stars in my book based on atmosphere and lack of choices of fave foods."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. A very authentic creole food offerings with a twist of Italian. 
Tried the jambalaya and loved it.
One of us tried the shrimp and grits
They also have a wide selection of wine

The place is in the middle of nowhere but take your chance in Akron"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  For years has been one of our favorite spots.  Love going there for lunch also"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Visited here after rave reviews from friends. We took their recommendations & made a reservation for seats at the bar- which was awesome since it's an open view to the kitchen, however can be a bit noisy, if you are looking for an intimate evening out.
The meal started out with a great focaccia bread and olive oil to dip. We skipped appetizers but saw countless orders of calamari, mussels, and octopus being prepared.
We ordered the shrimp & grits, along with a halibut special. the halibut was a little on the cool side, which is a bit disappointing since it was about a 1-2 step from kitchen to serve. The shrimp & grits had a nice, slightly spicy flavor without being overwhelming. The shrimp were huge & nicely cooked. The halibut was cooked perfectly & came in a delicious crawfish sauce & langistinos that reminded me of a thin seafood bisque. Overall, both dishes were very good. We finished the meal with a slice of peanut butter pie & pecan pie to go. The peanut butter was better in my opinion, as the pecan pie seemed to separate a little bit.
As other reviews state- plan to take your time... we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation (was seated right away) but still took over 1.5 hours without apps or eating dessert there. Everything was good, but neither of else felt that we needed to return soon."}
{"text":"We all really enjoyed our Cajun dishes and barbecued shrimp. They have a wonderful wine selection and several draft beers to choose from including a raspberry ale for my husband who doesn't typically drink. We loved our prosciutto wrapped Figs and liked the salads that came with the meals. Our friends recommended the French onion soup which we will return for in November when it gets cold. Our service with our waitress, Marissa, was wonderful. She was attentive and refilled our drinks and water when needed."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first we had reservations to sit at the counter & watch as the cooks pushed out wonder food. The counter for 2 is a great seat plus we got extra samples of food we didn't order. 

This time we had a table. The voodoo oysters were perfectly prepared & divine. He had pork loin that was served with red beans & rice and collard greens. The smoked turkey ladened  greens were so good I ordered a side to go. 

I had the redfish with crawfish sauce over stir fried veggies it was heavenly.  The 2 baskets of bread was perfect for \"fare la scapetta.\"  Everything was perfect even the drinks & especially the service. 

Make it a point to go here if you're a food lover, they do everything well. Italian meets Creole with intense flavorful sauces & beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed.  The angus steaks are always so good and tender.   Veggies and sides are usually delicious. Calamari is excellent!   Seafood selections are a little pricey at times and crawfish are sparse but they are having to 'import' them from out of state.   Chicken is very good.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chef personally served me my entree, cornmeal fried Lake Erie Perch with Louisiana oysters, veggies and mac n cheese.  Perch perch perch, I love it and this was yummy with the chipotle tartar sauce.  Veggies were great, specially the always challenging eggplant.

Mac n Cheese?  Loved the  sauce, pasta cooked properly but I didnt touch.  Hmmm fish lovers generally don't do mnc when they are enjoying the amazing fish!

Salad,  meh just tossed some mbg out of a bag on a plate,  but the balsamic was right on.

Oh yes.  They get serving NOLA style, meaning cocktails

Maitre de Patrick was attentive to a SF, from my online res to my arrival, big props for that!

Def a return visit is due on my next trip to the home Land in May."}
{"text":"My husband and went to Russo's on Thursday evening.  It was fantastic.  We sat at the end of the bar that overlooked the kitchen and chefs.  Everyone was very nice.  The chefs took time to talk to you while they were busy cooking.  I ended up getting the shrimp and grits.  I'm not a fan of shrimp and never had grits. It was wonderful.  One of the best meals I ever had.  I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"First time here and we'll be back! Reservations are a must on Saturday night - make sure to specify what table you'd like (booth). Despite mentioning it was a birthday celebration, the hostess attempted to seat us at a tiny table directly across from open grill. When asked we were told all booths are bespoke - was allowed to move to same table further down.

Food is amazing - def get the Louisiana Crawfish Monica with Fresh Cavatelli Pasta $13.99 as it blew us away! Shrimp and grits were nice big shrimp. Filet was also very good. 

Look forward to returning - possibly pizza in the Bacchus bar out back!"}
{"text":"Went to Russo's twice recently !! Excellent dinning experience with great selections of wines and fine cuisine . They have a new menu every day. The bar which is my favourite place has a great atmosphere. Everyone is very friendly. Sheila is a great host and makes sure everyone is having a great time !! Special thanks to chef Briston and Ridell . Will most definitely recommend this place !!

Thx

{"text":"We have never been disappointed by Russo's. While it is rather noisy, we've never had difficulty conversing. Recently had the shrimp and grits which was outstanding. My husband had a vegetarian pasta dish which was also very tasty. Our daughters were equally pleased with their dinners. Our server was relaxed but efficient. 

One of the things we appreciate about Russo's is that they continually update the menu so there is always a nice variety in addition to their core menu. 

While I agree with one of the reviewers regarding the casual dress worn by many of the patrons, I'm afraid that this has become the new normal at many restaurants. We still like to dress up a bit when we dine at more expensive restaurants, and have become accustomed to seeing others dressed similarly but even more in t-shirts and baseball caps.

Russo's is a true hidden gem - we love it!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was in the middle of no where.  I was pretty surprise when I walked in though, not exactly what I was expecting.  Its right next to a shady looking motel.  This place is a slightly more upscale than I thought.  Their entrees I think were maybe a little pricey as were their drinks.  Service was a little slow but I was with a big group.  I thought it was a little poor form to run out of pork chops as well as a number of desserts.  I ended up getting the seafood creole with steamed rice which was decent except they gave me very little rice so I felt as though I was eating stew."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant! Perfect service- beyond amazing food- every time I come! Better food and service than any restaurant I have ate at in NYC or Chicago. 

Happy to see the places packed- they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Russo's is an up-scale restaurant and bar which offers good quality Italian and Cajun food.  My wife and I like to start with the gumbo, which is thick and definitely NOLA.  Once through the gumbo you have two alternatives -- have another starter (under $10) or go for a large entree ($15-25).  Last time I was there I had a sea food stew that was platter size and, combined with the gumbo and a nice ale, made for a very filling meal.  

Service is good, noise levels can be high since the kitchen is open and behind the bar."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome! Had the GF Roasted Portobello, Shiitake, & Oyster Mushrooms on Spaghetti with Shallots, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Parsley, Basil, & Parmesan Cheese dish. Unbelievably incredible! Will visit again next baseball season!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Atmosphere is a little different. Very loud inside the restaurant and I felt like I was yelling my entire meal. Food makes up for the loudness."}
{"text":"This one is a favorite for my husband and I. The gumbo is bowl-licking good. The meatloaf is also a fave. The menu is a nice eclectic mix of Cajun, Italian, and American cuisine. Good wine selection, and always have had good service. The bar overlooks the open kitchen, and is good entertainment. All inside seating is a little noisy."}
{"text":"I know people love it and others at my table rave ... So maybe its me ... But my veal scallopini and pasta were very light on flavor.  Hard for me to tell the profile given the blandness.  Even the White French was average.  However Judy raved about her pasta and Stan loved the Cajun platter ... Plus the service was very good ... How bad can a place be that serves Lagavulin!  So I will try it again, but going Cajun."}
{"text":"We came here last Friday for a special occasion.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  Our food was very good.  My daughter and I split the beet salad, which was good.  We had the scallop appetizer which was very good but there were only 2 scallops and we had to share between 4 people, it would of been nice to have a few more.  I ordered the 4 oz filet which was awesome.  I generally don't finish a meal because the portions are so big but this was the exact size for me and the price was right too.  Nice job."}
{"text":"We love the surf and turf. Have never had an issue getting a reservation and the peanut butter pie is TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"Cajun? And Italian? Together? Sweet place with history but I've just ingested my sodium maximum for the year.  Jambalaya and beignets are fun if you are missing NOLA."}
{"text":"One of the best Nawlins style food I've had. The gumbo is unbelievably good and authentic. Originally from Akron, while living here, this place was a regular. Came home, from Atlanta for the weekend, it was an absolute must that I eat here.  The soft shell crab and the greens and the.....well, I have yet to have anything that's not any good.  And, I anticipate that never happening.  Great place to indulge."}
{"text":"Place is OK. Food is salty, way overpriced for decent food. The environment is the best thing about the place beside the oysters."}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans and been in Akron for 5 years and finally tried Russo's last night! I have been missing out on their amazing Cajun cuisines this whole time while in Akron!!! I was super impressed by the quality of the seafood they prepared. Very fresh. The raw oysters weren't salty and were very delish! Among the table we also tried the redfish with crawfish sauce (which includes crawfish tails on top) and this was fresh and cooked to perfection. The Mardi Gras veggies were a so tasty as well. Another was the halibut cheeks - so fresh again. I was very impressed and sad to say I had not given it a try over these last few years! Def recommend this place to anyone who wants to feel like you are eating Cajun delicious food like you would in Nola!"}
{"text":"If you like Cajun, this is the place. Both in the dining room and the more informal bar/ lounge - service and quality are top notch. A very skilled and knowledgeable bartender in the bar adds to the experience. Portions are large - make sure that those who are averse to hot and spicy dishes pay attention to wait staff's description of dishes. Can't go wrong with any of the Cajun / New Orleans style dishes."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good- it was just so incredibly Loud! We couldn't even hear each other!"}
{"text":"Went to Russo's last night to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food and service was absolutely fantastic. If someone asks for a restaurant recommendation we always send them to Russo's. Thanks again Russo's for helping me celebrate my wife's birthday.

{"text":"I'll have to agree with most of the reviews. Long story short, Russo's has great food, friendly service, with the downsides of loud crowd noise and a pace of service that's more on the leisurely side. That's OK if you plan for it and don't come here if you're in a hurry. I think the food is worth it, but the pace might not be worth it for some.

I love Creole food, which is a rarity here in NEO. I got the shrimp and grits. The rib-eye had a tasty, unique sweet-spicy cajun rub to it, and the veal was delicious.

For concert goers: Say, if your Blossom Music event is at 8PM, try to make reservations for 530PM, expect to stay 1 hour and 30 minutes, (maybe 2 hours if you order dessert, which we did not) be out by 7, enough time to last the stop-and-go-traffic towards Blossom parking. It's really 3.5 stars rounded out to 4 for me."}
{"text":"Went there tonight, we arrived at 4:12 and when the waitress came to our table she said we had to wait because they had not printed the dinner menus yet. The back of Russo's opens at 4.  My wife and I both ordered the fresh fish which was perch. When our plates arrived each of us got 3 pieces of fish. Each piece was no longer than my index finger and no wider than 2 of my fingers together. Dinner came with vegetables which consisted of 2 strips of peppers and sliver of squash. I finished my meal in about 3 minutes. Very disappointed since we spent over $40 with tip."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu and food here! They are the only place I know that makes gumbo like this. They also fly in fresh crawfish daily- A must have for first timers."}
{"text":"I am seriously kicking myself for not coming here earlier. 
Very solid Creole food.  Best Creole east of Heaven on Seven in Chicago.  
I would come here just for the beans and rice."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh how did I not know of this place before!?!? So glad I saw the light. We went over the weekend and I have to say it was one of the best meals I've had lately. My guy and I love trying new food, so we typically just get a few things and split it all. We got a bottle of wine from Italy, ordered the roasted garlic & bread (UH AMAZING) and then split the friend green tomatoes & calamari (both were absolutely delicious). We then had the cavatelli & it came with sausage & a meatball. All was amazing. We finished it off with peanut butter pie. Definitely safe to say I was in a bit of a carb hangover after. But perfect meal!"}
{"text":"This an awesome dining experience ! The cusine is also excellent with great service! We have been to many fine dining establishments but Russo's is the one place tell everyone about hands down! 

 You must try Thier Jumbolia !!!!!!

{"text":"Food was decent and service was fast. Very overpriced in my opinion. That being said, portions are generous and the servers are very helpful. We had the jambalaya and the chicken étouffée. Both were authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"Original review:

I have only had a few things off of the menu as I usually sit at the bar & have a glass of wine or two. I love the buzz about the place: watching the chef prepare meals, the ambience, the energy of the staff & customers, etc.  

A little pricey, but worth it.  Clean & classy.  Would recommend my boyfriend taking me here any time for dinner!  

Try the lounge in the back- drink & food specials and low key.

Update:

I stuggle greatly with this review, because I really do like this place and WANT to like it so much to keep going back; however, I have never had good service while dining.

One night, boyfriend and I went for dinner.  Our service started our poorly and ended just the same.  It took 20 minutes to get water!  We debated whether or not we should have stayed.  We did, but regretted it. 

As soon as our waitress came to our table, we ordered water & food- we weren't sure if we were going to get another chance.  As luck would have it, they were out of their chili rellano, which was a disappointment.  I forgot what we ended up ordering- not very memorable,  We never even got any bread, or service, for that matter.

Oh, Russo's, I have tried at least on six occasions..."}
{"text":"*About a month after this review was posted the manager contacted us (after reading the review) and refunded our entire meal. Glad there was a refund but still wish it had been dealt with when we were actually at the restaurant. As for the food, before dessert, it was delicious. 

Original review-
The one is solely for their complete lack of regard for food allergies. My husband and I went to dinner last night and he informed our waitress that he is allergic to both tree nuts and peanuts. We go to order dessert and he picks the bread pudding for us to share (we have had nut free bread pudding at lots of other restaurants). When it gets there I take a bite and panic as I realize there are chunks of nuts in the bread. Luckily, my husband had only eaten some whipped cream from the plate at this point. As the waitress walks by, I flag her down and ask if there are nuts in the dish. She says no, as if she knew for sure. I insist- so she checks, and indeed there are nuts in the bread pudding. She asks my husband if he wants something else, which he declines. We pay our bill and I make him tip her even though our evening could have been spent in the emergency room or worse thanks to her cavalier attitude. (which frankly I'm now regretting since I don't think she still realizes how serious this could hand been) I tell the manager on the way out, he notes that the waitress asked him if the dessert contained nuts but it must have been after the fact. Like that makes this somehow better...He offers my husband a Benadryl, and gives a half of an apology. I would expect such a place would have understood and taken food allergies much more seriously. I'm just glad there were actual nuts in the dish as opposed to nut flour or extract which I wouldn't have been able to detect since our waitress clearly did no checking before she served us food."}
{"text":"I searched yelp while riding east on 80 from Three Rivers Michigan Thursday and was I happy I detoured to Russo's for Dinner.  Gumbo Ya Ya, Drago's style BBQ'ed Oysters, and their house salad.  WOW great food, great service, friendly pleasant staff.  Great cocktail, local lager, and double Espresso sent me down the road home.

A great find and a really cool place.  People around me a the bar/open working kitchen were enjoying their food, especially the Italian specialties of pasta and meatballs.  Saw a local packing away a steak, big boy, looked satisfied.  Real NOLA roots in Russo's too.  I did not get to meet the owner but I was told he worked with Emeril Lagasse,  

There is a tavern in the rear that had quite a few families gettin' down on some sweet looking Pizza.

What I miss most of not traveling for business are these great gems out there on the road.  I now have NYC to totally immerse my food world in."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity (2nd visit) to go to russo's on our date nite... Once again not disappointed...we started with fried green tomatoes with a remoulade sauce and delicious shrimp...and a large bowl of Gumbo Ya Ya seasoned to perfection (as close as you can get to the real thing in New Orleans)...we ordered an entree of Jambalaya and a scallop (appetizer) with hush puppies... 2 scallops on appetizer over puréed parsnips... Delicious but a bit pricey.. Jambalaya was good but not the best thing I've had at Russo's.. Probably order something different next time.. Disappointed that Soft Shell Crab Appetizer not on menu.. Must be out of season ... Bread is very good, especially homemade Focaccia..had a wonderful dessert, Peanut Butter Pie..(you have to order it) light creamy drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce and crushed nuts!! Overall had a great experience and would recommend Russo's as one of the premier restaurants in Akron/NE Ohio area..."}
{"text":"Mussels are awesome and I really love the sauce coming along with. It would be nice if they provide some breads before the meal. Jambalaya is a little salty, but comes with a lot of meat, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, it does not matter if you eat in the front restaurant or in the bar in back and you will be satisfied. I have been here multiple times and never had a  bad meal or experience."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Everything has always proved to be delightful. I didn't grab a picture of the vanilla peach mousse desert. It was the bomb. Share a salad try the octopus and you can't lose on the entrees."}
{"text":"When I lived in Cleveland, I often took customers here and it was our favorite place to go for lunch.  It's a little bit of sophistication on a lonely stretch of road between Cuyahoga Falls and Hudson.  The food is excellent, but here's what really set the place apart:  you can see them making it.  They have a wrap-around bar surrounding the kitchen.  A bit expensive, but there's really nothing that comes close to Russo's in this 'hood."}
{"text":"This is our \"no kids, splurge\" spot. Phenomenal food and a nice, grown-up atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing menu!  Seafood specials (or anything on the specials menu) are a must to try.  Didn't even order anything off menu - just specials which you won't know til you get there. Not too many tables, but would highly recommend reservations (ask to sit at bar so you can view kitchen). Service was good too!  Usually can find one area of improvement but not this time - will definitely be back. Only suggestion is to be open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to place ever since we moved here from the South several years ago. It is a bit pricey and noisy, but this Cajun-style food is on point!!!  Oysters, redfish, shrimp and grits, collard greens, I could go on and on! It's all good!  Try it!!"}
{"text":"Pure and udder chaos for Mardi Gras--- We were very excited to celebrate with a Mardi Gras dinner at Russo's, and all expectations were vastly destroyed. 
There was no direction, hospitality, or service to be seen. We waited 20 minutes before even seeing a server, and at that we were forced to flag one down. Having picked up on a sense of delay, drinks, appetizer, and entrées were ordered promptly all in one. Our Jambolaya came out first, almost immediately. I was shocked to see that they had given us a to go container, no more than 8 ounces of this $10 entrée. Apparently we had missed the memo that all food will be served in Styrofoam this evening.... awesome. 
Approximately 10 minutes past and still no drinks, again forcing us to flag the waiter down.
I could go on and on regarding the delays, and nonexistent service. Instead, I will save my time and simply state that the entire restaurant was chaotic, that I would be embarrassed to call hospitality 
We will not be returning, or recommending."}
{"text":"First off, the service at Russo's is mediocre. Particular the hostess staff, they did not communicate well and we waited 20 minutes beyond our reservation for a table. Wait staff was fine, though. 

The food is a little overpriced too, I cannot lie. My cavatelli were cooked well and the meatball and sausage were fine too, but not worth $21. Several others in our party were also not overwhelmed by the meal. Overall, it was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Russo's is one of the best restaurants in the area.  I have been there about 10 times I would say.  Some favorites are the mussel appetizer and as far as entrees the cold smoked pork chop, the chicken fried steak, the cavatelli pasta, the shrimp and grits, and the one with fish in crawfish sauce are all incredible.  Those are the best, but everything on the menu is great.  The service is also great as the people at the bar are very nice.  Russo's is a fantastic restaurant in all aspects."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see nobody has written a review of this fine establishment yet, so I decided to write one, even though it has been quite a while since the last time I visited. 

If you may believe the website, this restaurant serves Italian and Creole soul food. A quick look on their menu tells that they split both cuisines, rather than fusing them. The menu has creole/cajun entrees as well as Italian dishes, which are mostly home made pastas. What I remember most vividly is an excellent New York Strip steak with a heavy, full-bodied red wine. My dining experience, quite honestly, does not require more than that.

But Russo's does offer more. The ambience is one of a buzzing, happening, and chattering place. People seemed happy to be there. There is the opportunity to take a booth or to sit at the bar, from where you can see the cooks at work. The same goes for the staff and service. Although it might've been the wine, the waitress' charm left me slightly in love with her at the end of my meal."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. This is my husband's and I go to spot for date night. 
Always be sure to make reservations - this place get packed. I had a reservation at the bar one night, and ended up still having to wait 25 minutes to be seated because they must have given up our seats (even though we were there on time). That was a little disappointing.
However, the bar is the best area to sit, as you get to watch your food get cooked right in front of you. 
It can get loud - it is a small restaurant with another restaurant attached in the back. Drinks sometimes take a while to get served  and I don't recommend ordering a Moscow mule at this place. My husband and I ordered one and I am not even sure what we received but it wasn't that.  Didn't come in a tin cup, didn't have a hint of ginger beer.
 
Excellent food - Like, amazeballs. 
We usually try something new every time we go. I have a shellfish allergy so picking new items can sometimes be tricky but I am never disappointed with a meal. Ever. Their menu changes ever so often so keep that in mind for every visit."}
{"text":"Here for the first time and we are extremely disappointed. Yuengling on tap 16 oz 5 bucks.  Very over priced. Pizza was under cooked and the Cesar salad was pathetic. A very small corned beef-sandwich 12 bucks no fries. Just the sandwich alone. We will never come back again."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd trip to Russo's - it is a nice meeting place between Cleveland and Akron/Canton. Our first visit was much better - a nice summer visit on the patio!

This time, it was still a great visit - food was great - except a little salty for our tastes. Had a wide variety of choices - huge special list to pick from! Will go back. 

Its great for groups or to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This is truly an unexpected place for some delicious cajun food.

In the middle of nowhereish Akron, a friend who spent 7 years in Nola dragged us into Russo's. He claimed it was one of the best places outside of Nola to find a good southern meal, and he was spot on.

The Crawfish Etouffe, Jambalaya, and Oysters here are dynamite. The fried green tomatoes have a nice crunch, and the cocktails are worth 6 stars. (on a 5 star scale) It was the best Sazerac i've had outside of....well, anywhere.

Service was friendly and prompt, and the establishment is semi-formal. You can get away with a nice shirt and jeans here, but expect most of the well-to-do clientele to be dressed better than that. There's even a gorgeous back patio for those warm summer breezy evenings.

Truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Just had to give a shout out to our favorite restaurant in Summit county. We've never had a bad meal in the many years we've eaten here. Husbands favorites are the ya-ya soup, shrimp etouffe, and eggplant parmesan with their homemade bolganese sauce. I love the Navejo tacos with seafood, any of the catches of the day, and their bread pudding. Everything is always fresh and homemade. No prepackaged, frozen  junk ever."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun and Italian. What's not to love? Pair that with tasty Thirsty Dog beers on tap and you have a great hidden gem. Russo's is one of those places with a great local feel and a diverse crowd of regulars. They accommodated our group of 7 on a Saturday night quickly and efficiently. As a bonus, there was a very talented guy playing guitar in the bar area. Overall delicious food not found in many other places in Northeast Ohio, great atmosphere and located in an area I love."}
{"text":"We went for the cajun food and it was horrible. The prices were high ant the quality of the food was very disappointing. The rice with the creole dish was hard and undercooked. I have had lots of Cajun/Creole food ant this was by far the worst I have ever had. The staff was functional at best but not welcoming or friendly. We will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a high class restaurant. Very clean and nice inside.

I had the pasta with scallops and shrimp. The seafood was perfectly cooked and the pasta and sauce was excellent.

Great service. Reservations recommended. Pricey but huge portions. 

I enjoyed it a great deal."}
{"text":"This may be the best the best restaurant in Northeast Ohio, including all of Cleveland.  Have been a dozen times and am never disappointed.  Every time I give a new restaurant a shot, I question why I just didn't head back to Russo's.  Cajun cuisine is straight out of the NOLA play book and every bit as good - the gumbo and étouffée rock and they know how to prepare soft shell crab. Specials are always on point, often seasonal, and desserts never disappoint.  Bacchus Lounge is also a great counter balance to the white tablecloths."}
{"text":"I started eating Dave Russo's food when he was chef at Liberty Brewing way back when. Such a sad day when it closed down but we rejoiced when we found out he was opening his own place and adding Italian to his menu along with his tried and true cajun offerings. Every time we go home for a visit, we eat at Russo's AT LEAST once...usually more. Everything on the menu is good. I think I've literally eaten everything on it. It can be a little loud in the restaurant because of the open kitchen and all the hard surfaces, so just be prepared for that. Oh, and they always have a great beer and wine selection - super important."}
{"text":"Actually ate there twice on a recent trip to Stow/Hudson.  Etoufee on the second visit was not nearly as good as the first - not sure what happened, but a really nice place, good food selection, great bar to sit at and watch the kitchen - good, fun crowd.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"One of the very Best Creole - Cajun style food you'll find outside of New Orleans\"!  Anywhere!  The Gumbo was prepared perfectly and shrimp and Andouille salad entrée was  superb!  Service was \"spot on\" and for my first (of many) visits to this Cleveland \"gem\", they made us feel like were \"one of the regulars\"!"}
{"text":"Food and the service was very good, but it was extremely noisy inside to the point where it was hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night on a whim.  We had just been to the Hudson Wine Fest and decided to grab a late dinner.  We really had a nice time.  We didn't have a reservation and they were very busy but within 5 minutes wife and I got seated.  I had the Mahi Mahi and wife had the chicken fried steak.  Both were excellent.   My only complaint would be the Caesar salad.  The dressing was very light and didn't really seem to be a Caesar dressing."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. A little on the pricey side. Great for a date night !!"}
{"text":"Found good reviews on Yelp and decided to stop in prior to a concert at Blossom.  What a great choice we made.  Sat at the bar up front and enjoyed the interaction with both the bartenders and cooks who prepare the food right in front of you.  Had the grilled oysters as appitizer (awesome must have) along with the halibut special which was off the charts. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time in 3 years and were so glad we did!  Great food, and service was excellent.  Had a really hard time deciding on what to order because everything we saw going past us to other people looked and smelled amazing. Jen was our server, she was very professional and attentive.  We will be back for sure. So glad we went!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 7:30 with reservations and I'm just leaving at 9:30. The filet my husband ordered was over cooked and dry. My seafood was amazing as well as the appetizer of crab cakes. The service was terribly slow.  Suggest the seafood and go with lots of time to spare."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant.  Off the Beaten path, but have eaten here numerous times but finally remembered to review.  An awesome mix of creole and Italian.  Very unassuming building that you could fly right by but the inside is very nice and has a cool open kitchen with a bar surrounding it.    The Calamari, Caesar, or the craw-fish salad are all great ways to start off your meal. The Navajo Tacos as well as the many steak options with great whipped mash potatoes can't be beat.  A great place for a family dinner or date."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  They are on the pricey side, but all the food is fresh and delicious.  The menu is half Italian and half Cajun."}
{"text":"went with another couple before attending Cleveland Orchestra performance at Blossom  the service is wonderful and friendly and the food!!! We were able to bring our own wine and were ok with the corkage fee.. got the bill and charged twice! that wasn't cool.  The appetizers were delicious and so many choices.  we were told that it's really fun to sit at the bar and watch the chef work work their magic"}
{"text":"Omg!!! What a gem! 

We were looking for a place near blossom and this was highly recommended. 

We sat at the bar, and in my opinion that's the best seat in the house. Watching the chefs perform their magic was like watching a ballet. We couldn't believe the precision and pace that they were putting out amazing dishes. 

Everything that we saw leave the kitchen looked fabulous.  I had the Steak Pizzaiola and the steak was perfectly done, and a very interesting twist on steak. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

My friend had the jambalaya and it was excellent, perfect amount of heat!

We wanted to stay and try everything on the menu!

It will definitely be new destination restaurant!

I am very excited because I will be doing a project in Cuyahoga Falls, so I'm sure I will be back soon!

Also I have to mention that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We got delayed on the freeway and were late for our reservation and they were great about keeping in touch with us and we're very pleasant about the unfortunate situation. With the restaurant that is as busy as this place, sometimes the front of house people can be \"stressed\". The ladies I spoke with were extremely pleasant and friendly!  

Also, our waitress at the bar was really friendly and accommodating to a special drink request that I had."}
