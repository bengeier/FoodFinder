{"text":"Got home from the airport last night (Sunday) at 11 pm. No food in the house, and starving. Check what's open: Mi Gia Phung. Why not try it?  Ordered the deep fried spring rolls, the large Thai-style pho (me) and the medium vegetarian pho (Jackie). All were delicious.  Apparently they don't necessarily close at midnight, it's whenever they stop getting business, which \"might be 11 pm, might be 2 am\". So that's kind of annoying because you can't count on them being open if you roll in at 11:15 pm, but if you're lucky they might be open even later.  Most importantly though, the food was delicious and the waitress was friendly (I think her parents might own the place? They were hanging out in the back.) Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Short and simple.  We ordered sushi and dim sum.  It was nasty and the service was terrible.   No napkins, no water refills, pushy waiters, everything had to be asked upon for.  Food was mediocre, overcooked and not fresh.  I will never come back, I recommend going to anywhere else but here.  SO terrible."}
{"text":"I don't know what a five-star Pho place is, but this place has the basics down.  Open late enough, tasty broth, good amounts of beef, and the spicy variant is perfect for a cold and windy night.  It's right in my hood, and I predict I'll be a regular here for a while."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is bad. I'm not going back.  Ordered the Pho Dac Biet to compare it among the other restaurants along the Gerrard St. East area, and the result is really bad for Pho Mi Gia Phung.   First thing I noticed is the tacky decor, really bad second rate interior. I was expecting much better since they're the newest among the pho restaurant that opened a couple of years back. Thought I tried them out, bad idea, but you never know until you try it out. They certainly charge a good price for the XL bowl of Pho Dac Biet at $6.95, which seems very reasonable considering what you get.  My first sign of trouble is the plate of bean sprout and basil that they give you. The bean sprout didn't look fresh and had lots of small bits of the green shell in it, - it's a sign that they didn't clean it well or bother to rinse out the green shell.   The bowl of XL pho came in quite fast, and I was surprise that it was that fast. The broth was darker than I'm use to and there was so much that it drown out all the other ingredients which you have to scoop up from the bottom. But have to give them credit for having the most savory broth along the strip, definitely the colour tells the story here. Still, way too much broth, it's like they pour way more to make the bowl fuller since they didn't put enough ingredient to make a profit.  It had a huge piece of tendon in it! WTF were they thinking, didn't they bother to chop it down smaller.  The noodles were well cooked but nothing special here, since everyone else seems to get it right. Also, they skimped on the rare beef and I didn't recall how they tasted because frankly there were like 3 or 4 pieces that weren't very memorable.  I would go to Pho House or Mi Mi further east before venturing in to Pho Mi Gia Phung again. You've been warned. Order the same Pho Dac Biet from each place and compare for yourself. Stay the hell away from this place."}
{"text":"Took my mom and niece here for lunch and was quite happy with the food.  We ordered their special noodle soup, totally forgot the name but it comes with the baked shrimp cookie.  The place looks really great inside with a full bar, nice spot for patio beers.  The noodle soup was a good sized portion with even a better portion of seafood, pork, wonton, crispy wonton and more.  Ive had my share of these soups and this is one of the better soups I've had, conveniently located at Gerrard and broadview."}
{"text":"3.5**  Walking along Chinatown #2, I was hungry for Vietnamese food. The only problem was that the entire street (Gerrard St) was lined with 4-5 Viet restaurants, each claiming to be the best Pho noodles.  I decided to go into this one, without any expectations. It was rather a good choice. The prices were reasonable and the service was solid.  I ordered the the rice with chicken, steamed egg with crab, with a fried egg over my rice. It came with a large bowl of soup as well ($6.99).  The entire portion kept me satiated throughout the day. The orange sauce that comes with Viet rice is always the kicker. Delicious!  I will go back to try the Pho."}
{"text":"they raised the prices to be sort of normal, still a little on the cheap side but not really. So what I'm saying is, nevermind"}
{"text":"Pho Mi Gia Phung is like a cross between a north american pub and a Thai Vietnamese restaurant. The menu is simple, yet attractive with pub food and beer as well as thai/viet food.  The Duck Leg and Black Mushroom soup was mediocre. A delicately flavoured thin broth (but not well flavoured), both mushroom and duck leg were over cooked, and surprisingly for a mushroom dish, there was only one (1) mushroom...  Sitting on the patio, I noticed they put a lot of attention to detail in making it look nice and clean, despite it being located on the side of a parking alley."}
{"text":"Tasty and decent prices. Their green dragon rolls are MASSIVE. Authentic Vietnamese coffee as well. Decent patio to boot. Pretty good bet for lunch if you're in the East Chinatown area."}
{"text":"A friend and I were walking around what I refer to as \"Chinatown Part 2\" just checking for anything interesting. We decided we were hungry and would eat at anything that didn't just say Vietnamese in the window. That is when we found Pho Mi Gia Phung which said Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese in the window.  On first entrance the place was a surprise. It was very clean and looked very modern. The carpeting still appeared to be in near perfect condition and there was not a scratch on the tables. The bar was already really nice and clean as well. I am not used to restaurants of this nature to be in such a clean state. That is close to where to positivity ends...  The woman who worked there put a pen and receipt on the table as if she already knew she would understand what it is we were trying to order. We made a few selections from the menu and wrote them down for her. The fried wantons with plum sauce came first and they were actually quite good. They were really small and greasy, but quite tasty. The General Tao's chicken came next, but even though written down with name and menu number the wrong item was brought (some sort of vegetable rich tofu dish) and had to be sent back. Then came the chicken and mushroom soup for my friend. She said the chicken was pretty horrible, there were only three mushrooms, but the broth was tasty. Finally the General Tao's came and I am still undecided on my opinion. It was more of a tan colour than the standard deep red, but the sauce was still rather tasty, even if not spicy in the least. The chicken itself was not battered and fried as usual, but it was also not that fresh tasting.  The experience was not a horrible one, but the food left a lot to be desired. The prices were average for a Chinese restaurant but could have been better on certain items. They get the extra point for the cleanliness of the restaurant itself and the quickness of the service, but I will not be returning..."}
{"text":"I quite like this place, and has recently been my go-to restaurant for Vietnamese food.  Their pho broth tastes a lot more like real meat broth, rather than the msg laden pho broths from other pho places (which isn't always a bad taste, but sometimes you just have to try the real stuff).  The lime goes really well with this broth too.  Their bubble teas are kinda smaller in portion than I'm used to, but the flavour is fantastic!  They definitely don't skimp out on the coconut in the coconut bubble tea.  The Chinese food items on the menu are decent, but I'd stick with the Vietnamese items.  The portions of the Chinese food items seem a little smaller than your usual Chinese restaurant portions, and although they're good, I wouldn't say top-notch."}
{"text":"Reliably mediocre.  Why do I keep eating here? I always ask myself that when I leave, because it's never very good, but I know I will always come back. It isn't bad; it just isn't good.  A detailed breakdown of 'inoffensively okay'... - There is no more $10 pitcher deal.  It's $13.95 now...  Still a pretty good price but, it's no doorcrasher deal... (the best doorcrasher ever was futureshop.ca having 80gb hard drives for $100 on boxing day in 2004, FYI.)  - The beer list is acceptable. They have Tankhouse, Creemore and Welly (and Sapporo if you're into that sort of thing) as far as \"better beers\" go (still $14) - The pho is okay... it's not as good as Pho House next door (but they don't have beer) - They take debit... but there is a 50c fee, no matter how much you spend (does that cancel out actually taking debit on the scale of good to bad?  Is taking debit with a fee just high enough to make you go 'hmm' worse than not taking debit?  I don't even know.) - The chinese donuts are okay (see video here: http://vimeo.com/18392242) - The hot plates are actually pretty good (skillets of meat and veggies) but they're expensive for the portion size compared to other options... they seem to be of higher quality though than some of the other things I've had the misfortune of ingesting (see lame duck here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahlindsay/5392962451/) - slightly alarming that everything comes out 10 seconds after your order it (see lame duck photo) noted exception is the hot skillets [did you know that microwaves make your food hot with radiation?  yeah!]  Overall, I will definitely eat here again, not even reluctantly, mostly due to proximity to my house and affordable but not brain-explodingly-cheap beer prices on decent but not-my-favourite beers."}
{"text":"Quite decent. Had some mi dish with soup on the side with the shrimp cracker. Very decent.. very very decent."}
{"text":"House egg noodles are what I generally stick to. Though not listed on the menu I recommend the \"thick\" noodles. These fresh noodles are served dry with the broth in a separate bowl on the side. I am a huge fan of these noodles!!!!  Beer is $3.25 bottles and $10 pitchers. Though these prices are subject to change."}
