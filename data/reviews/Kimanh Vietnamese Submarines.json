{"text":"This little place serves up a decent sub for a decent price. Popular with the high school kids across the street."}
{"text":"Love these subs. They put crushed peanuts on them if you like and it's a nice addition. I also really like the sauce they put on their subs.

I've gone here late at night and also for lunch on several occasions. Staff is friendly and clearly are proud of their business.

A 17th ave institution."}
{"text":"Great subs. They use some kind of butter or sauce on the bread that makes them uniquely good. 

Quality is consistent every time I visit. Haven't tried anything but their subs."}
{"text":"Came across this place like a blessing in disguise. It was a very hot day, and even the evening proved to rest in a hot and humid state. The idea of cooking was the last thing on my mind, and I really didn't want to order pizza, sigh. So we went for a little walk on 17th ave. Just around the corner from our street was Kimanh, the doors propped open, and a few guys sitting outside. Now I took this as a good sign that a Little Vietnamese sub wouldn't hurt and could do no harm.

Ordering was a tricky, but not due to confusion, but for the sake of having to decide on a particular option. We decided to keep it simple as it was getting late, and share a beef satay sub, and an order of yam fries. Then with another snap decision the wonton soup.

It's a neat environment, you can watch how they're preparing and cooking your order, and there's a movie playing on a TV if watching people chef it out isn't your thing. 

Lastly the food was really tasty, we really enjoyed the sub, it had that creamy beefy texture with that tinge of sweetness that really makes a Vietnamese sub. As for the wonton soup, my boyfriend went so far as to lick that bowel clean.

We will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Quick and Tasty are 2 words to decribe this place. Ohh...and 3rd word is affordable. I usually have the assorted cold cuts and it is one of the best in town. I have ordered both the chicken and beef subs for friends and they also said it was one of the best they have had. This is also aone of the few places to offer green apple green bubble teas. This combo is among one of my favorite lunches. Even when this place is packed, you rarley wait for more than 5 minutes to get your order."}
{"text":"When you think about it, Vietnamese food really is the best post-bar snack...

Fried spring rolls or wontons satiate the crispy craving that seems to increase with the amount of alcohol consumerd. Carbs in the form of noodles in the Bun or in a salad roll, or your Bahn Mi baguette help to absorb excess whiskey in your stomach. Sate, peppers and chili paste provide a nice heat kick that is sorely lacking in pretty much any other fast food. And, carrots, cucumber and cilantro are vegetables! When was the last time your post-pub scarf included vegetables? (and no, tomato sauce on pizza or pickles on your cheeseburger don't count).  

So, it goes without saying that Kimanh on the 17th ave strip should be a beacon to the hungry drunk.

The food if fine, if somewhat unremarkable. My sate sub was loaded with beef, sauce and veggie; though the carrots could have been a bit more pickled and the promised jalapenos didn't really bring any heat to speak of. Spring rolls where nice and densely packed, fried crisp to order. The fried wontons even better with a bit more ginger kick to the filling (though in hindsight I'm not sure why they would make separate fillings for spring rolls and wontons...the ginger thing could have all been in my head)... My soda was warm; however the array of bubble teas that were prepared and served to the group before me looked very cold, tasty and wet, so I probably should have just otdered one of those.

Overall I'd give the food a 3/5. Fine, tasty, quick and pretty good value (especially thinking about how much they could be charging drunks for their late-nite snacks, and during stampede no less! They really should get a star for being generally friendly and not gouging their poor inebreated customers!)

So, final rating 4/5. It's the location, hours and context that turn Kimanh from a run-of-the-mill Vietnamese hole-in-the-wall to a certifiable civic treasure.

Shine on you crazy diamond.

I need to get some sleep..."}
{"text":"My friends who went to Western High School rave about this place.

I love having the option of having a viet sub during a late night out on the weekend on 17th Ave. Kimanh gave me that opportunity. I love viet subs, and this one held up it's part of the bargain. 

Skip out on Clive Burger and UNA, and change it up with Kimanh's delicious viet subs."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, usually I just go across the street to Thai Tai. It's my favourite place, so it's hard for me to deviate from it, but as a true Yelper, I urged myself to try a new place this time!

Kimanh subs is just fine! They have delicious subs for cheap, all the fixin's, and bubble tea as well!

This place is quite tiny however, so I appreciate that they set up benches outside for people who don't want to eat elbow to elbow with others.

The ambiance isn't the greatest I've ever seen, but it's decent, and the food is good.

Overall, an absolutely fine place to stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"This was a four-star visit, until the bellyache kicked in. 

But, I was glad they were here with their Tofu Delight, when Clive was depressingly out of vegan burgers. Could've used more seasoning, but the bread was delicious. The sweet Filipino lady making my sandwich was more than happy to point out all the vegan options available to me, such as their fresh fruit bubble teas.

Oof. The grumbly tummy on the way home though! I hope it was just my stomach getting accustomed to all the food shoved in to it in a big hurry after getting denied vegan options in two different downtown establishments (Borgo and Clive)... and not a cleanliness issue with Kimanh."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here while walking around 17th Ave and in need of a snack. I opted for some fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls, and what I really appreciated (given I just walked in and didn't have any information about the place) is that everything was fresh and handmade upon order. No one wants spring rolls that have been sitting around for half the day, so I was really happy with both the quality and the freshness. 

There are a range of Vietnamese subs and other options, including some north american picks like yam fries. Bubble tea, too."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese subs and bubble teas in this city.  I've been coming here for years and it's consistantly good.  The sanswiches are made with a fresh baguette, delicious spicey marinated chicken or beef, pickled carrots, hot peppers and cilantro.  They make a great bubble tea made with either green or black tea.  Then you choose your flavor out of a dozen choices.  They also make a good blended bubble tea with a choice of pearls or flavored jellies.  I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Kim Anh is your best choice for Vietnamese subs on 17th Av. People often make the mistake of going across the street to Tai Tai for the same fare, but those people are missing out.

All of the items on the menu appear to be made by hand in-store (I've been there while they're hand-rolling spring rolls and boiling tapioca pearls.) and their Bubble tea selection is a good mix of sugary delights and fresh fruit/herbal mixtures. 

The price is right and the service is quick - how can you go wrong?

The only reason I am docking them a star is due to no real place to sit and eat, you must take your food to go. In the summer they often put out some patio chairs out front for some nice people-watching, but that's about it!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, my stomach is killing me right now... had a sub from this place for the first time tonight, and for the first time in my life, had a tummy ache from eating out. I think they might have a food safety issue, because I ate nothing out of the ordinary all day, and just been having this tummy ache an hour after eating the sub..., so consume at your own risk..."}
{"text":"This place a hidden gem, the banh mi subs are tasty, turn around time for the sandwich is also very quick. They also have a good assortment of drinks in the fridge and their bubble teas and Fresh fruit juices are terrific.They have a bit of counter space to eat your sandwich and there are 4 chairs outside for you to munch away on a nice day. I've been to kim anh at lot of times as I work right next door, small places like this are gems, cheap,,tasty,,and fast!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my friend last week as it's close to her place and one of her faves. We had planned to take our lunch to a park but the windy and chilly temperature led us to eat inside, which had me a little apprehensive when I saw how filthy and dirty the table was. It was a little awkward ordering when a bunch of high school kids from across the street came in, there was really no order or system to get people in and out quickly. We weren't in a rush though, so I didn't mind.

We decided to order a couple of subs and share some spring rolls. I also had a bubble tea and my girlfriend had an iced black tea. My sub itself was SUPER good, although a little spicy! They completely messed up my friends sub, but remade it for her right away. The spring rolls were tasty, although dark and crunchier than other spring rolls I've had, which led me to believe they were double fried. My bubble tea was perfect, my friends iced tea was HOT when she got it, but cooled down once it had some time to mix with the ice cubes. 

Our meals were reasonably priced, instead of hitting up Thai Tai I will come back here next time. Perhaps when they aren't busy, they should spend some time wiping the tables and cleaning up."}
{"text":"Nice staff, super fast, great tofu sub :) tried a few tofu subs downtown and so far this place is my favorite"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night just before midnight and I was in around the 17th avenue area. I was actually headed home when I figured I should get something to eat - in all honesty, I was craving fried chicken but when I drove by Kimanh, I thought it would be a 'healthier' choice ;) 

I know someone who raves about Kimanh and said that they have the best Vietnamese subs so I went in for a late night bite. It was pretty quiet at that hour and I ordered some spring rolls (sooo healthy haha) and a satay beef sub. The lady asked if I wanted any cheese and without hesitation I said yes (was being extra healthy that night).  It didn't take long for them to prepare my order and I took it to-go. An order of spring rolls has four and it came with a  side of fish sauce for dipping. I love spring rolls with plum so I asked for a couple. I couldn't wait , so on my drive home I snacked on the spring rolls and they were delicious! Super crispy with a generous meat filling, even better with plum sauce on top! 

The satay beef sub was good - toasted bread, sautéed beef, cilantro, onions, carrots, cucumber and cheese. I found that there was too much of a bread to meat ratio and that the meat was chewier than other beef satay subs I've had. Flavor was good but just some misses with the rest of the sub.

Overall, I'd say Kimanh is a place to hit up when its late at night and you're hungry. Spring rolls are dope! Though,  I definitely have had better satay beef subs - if you're looking for a reeeeeeeally amazing satay beef sub, The Bake Chef Co. in the University of Calgary is the place to go!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their subs and crave them quite often. They are super inexpensive for what you get ($6.75). Blows subway waaaaay out of the water. Careful with the chili subs as they are pretty spicy. It's a shame they don't have seating. We normally park an eat ours in the car because we can't wait until we get home! Haha"}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed Kimanh yet?! I adore this little place. 
I would have to agree with Juliet B in that I don't understand why anyone would choose to go across the street when Kim Anh is right here. 
Whenever I am craving a Vietnamese Sub, Kimanh is my first choice. The prices are very reasonable- I'm talking $4 for a veggie sub, loaded with my third favourite herb for eats-cilantro, on a delightfully crispy bun. Everytime I go, I double check to make sure the sauce is vegetarian, and they are very patient with my vegan paranoia. 
I would love to try some of their other offerings sometime if they are vegetarian friendly, but for now I am very happy with my regular order. They also offer up bubble tea, which I should probably try soon. :) They don't have anywhere to sit inside, so I'd recommend taking your subs to go. My friends and I usually manage to grab a spot on the little wooden bench right outside if the weather allows. But don't sit there. It's our spot."}
{"text":"The lady did not take off the gloves she was wearing to make my salad rolls when I was paying at the cashier. I will not go back. 

and the sauce the place made for the rolls did not taste good and weird texture."}
{"text":"I went back and tried the chicken satay sub but the chicken is flavourful and not spicy.  The bread is fresh and crispy, veggies are a great additional to the chicken.  It was a filling and delicious lunch for $6.75."}
{"text":"2nd time I've been here and it does really hit the spot. I bought the beef sate sub, it tasted fresh and had lots of flavour. Then the lady suggested to try the avocado bubble tea and it's the best one I've ever had. Plus you can't beat the price! Go here and be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, two places offer Vietnamese subs and they are literally across the street from each other.  Which one to choose? 

The answer is obvious - Kimanh.

Great menu of FRESH options but I hit them up for their subs.  For $6 I almost always get a lovely BBQ pork sub on a toasted bun, my choice of toppings, and a fantastic sauce.  I should probably only eat about half the sub, but it's so damn delicious that I usually eat the entire thing.

Service is fast and efficient and always very pleasant (not always the case across the street).  

Bottom line - if you need a quick, fresh, good meal on 17th, hit up Kimanh!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended that I try Vietnamese subs, or Banh Mis, in Calgary.  The ones in Toronto, typically will have pickled daikon and carrot, cilantro, a strange butter garlic sauce, Vietnamese sausage, and pate in a nice crusty bread.  That is the banh mi that I have come to know and love.  

I walked into Kim Anh and I looked at the menu, and I thought to myself, what a strange offering!  Marinated chicken!  Pork!  Beef!  Tofu!  I was befuddled.  I decided to try the vegetarian one, which ended up being the buttery garlic sauce, pickled carrots, cilantro, peanuts, and something that tasted like hoisin sauce, in a bun.  I thought it wouldn't be good, but it was!  The bun was not as crusty as the ones I know of in Toronto, but still good.  

Definitely a good place to stop after a late night out, or if you want a cost-effective lunch."}
{"text":"I love eating here. The food is hot fast and so tasty. The staff is so nice and welcoming.  I love that it seems like a family business.  See you guys soon. Mmm they Evan have chocolate milk :)"}
