{"text":"This  place was recommended to me by local Sewickley folks, who are foodies.  I was not disappointed!  The reviews on Yelp all speak highly of the food...which we completely agreed!  The Delmonico was amazing and the Chicken Penne was a delight.  Our server was relaxed and terrific!  It was our first time and she was spot on with her suggestions and accomodated us on a  special request. I will go back ."}
{"text":"Good fish, lamb, steaks, risotto, salads and a pleasant atmosphere at the bar or booths. Food is priced $5 more an entree than feels right, but it has always been prepared well, so sometimes it is worth it.  Service has been good, but recently seems to be slipping.  Mis-communication may be some of the problem.  Not sure.  But a recent special night out was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Was visiting from So Cal for the holidays and my mother in law took us here for dinner. The food was delicious, the service was ooookay. But they get three stars because I asked the waitress if I could keep my Yuengling pint glass that my two beers had been served in (it was adorable, with a depiction of three puppies on it). Our food and bar tab was over $100 for three of us. The waitress asked the owner and he said No! Laaaaame. Don't think we will be going back there next time we visit Sewickley."}
{"text":"Very cute little restaurant in the heart of Sewickley.  The food is cheap and tasty (menu located here: http://restaurants.post-gazette.com/pa/sewickley/286413-sweet-water-grille/menu/lunch/).

If I had one compliant, it would be regarding the weird wall separating the bar from the restaurant.  At the bar, it will be all young professionals hopping around and sharing wine...with families and older couples seated on the other side of this half-wall.  It makes the joint seem a little bipolar.  I'd love to see the wall come down to make Sweet Water Grille a more unified space."}
