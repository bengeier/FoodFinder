{"text":"everyone i know loves their burgers, I'm not a fan though. They're that extra sweaty fall-a-part messy pile type, so if that's your thing, go for it. The salad is meinh, all right I guess, nothing amazing though. The fries are not great, they look and taste like freezer jobbies, but edible enough I guess.

What I can't recommend on any level is the french onion soup. Google image search \"french onion soup\". It's supposed to be a TON of awesome baked melted cheese piled on top of seasoned bread or toast floating in onion soup. What it should not be is a small bowl of watery onion broth with a teeny tiny crouton with 2 slivers of shredded cheese on top. Needs 500 times more cheese slivers to be considered tasty.

Shame, I wish I liked this place more, everyone else seems to."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of burger Wednesdays although the service is always a bit sub par. I always find that I'm waiting in line longer than than the person(s) behind me, it's as if my food has gone missing in the lunch rush.

Otherwise, the burger with salad is always a great treat. Juicy, fall apart messy-ness, but really worth the mess. Be wary about the feature burger though, they always sound delicious and there are many different creative combinations, but they always seem to get a bit overzealous -- the flavours tend to get lost, maybe because it's so hard to keep the burger from falling apart so you can have a few decent bites in one shot. The salad is a delightful mixture of greens, spiced walnuts, dried cranberries and apricots...my only complaint is that the salad portion always seems so small."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Working in Liberty Village, this place is amazing for lunch especially their daily specials. Got the tacos on a Tuesday - you get 3 amazing tacos and a side all for $10 or so. Brilliant. Also their tuna sandwich is pretty kick ass. The patio seating is very nice and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to work at a place that caters food from Merci Mon Ami for most of our client meetings - which means I've had the chance to try most of the sandwiches and wraps. Every single one of them has been excellent, vegetarian and not. The salad is always fresh, the dressing always delicious. The bread for the sandwiches seems to be baked in-house: it's always fresh and crusty.

I've eaten here on my own dime a zillion times, too, just because it's so close to work.

I'll admit my favourite treat from Merci Mon Ami is their hamburger - it has all the flavour of a home made burger (*very* juicy), and the toppings let you personalize it as you like. And, very occasionally, I'll splurge for a glass of wine with that burger - a great way to mellow out in the middle of a stressful day."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this quick as I've only been here as a takeout option during the work week:

Service = Friendly
Food = Delicious
Price = less than $15 for pretty much any dish or sandwich with a non-alcoholic beverage

Fantastic place if you're looking for a delicious meal in less than 15 mins."}
{"text":"Whamburger Wednesday is fantastic - the meat quality in the burgers is great and the toppings are always fresh and delicious.  I've tried a number of the weekly specials and they're generally interesting and tasty.  Side salad is surprisingly good too - it's not just lettuce leaves and generally includes cranberries and walnuts along with the delicious dressing.

The turkey baguette is also great when it's not Wednesday, but if you're there on a Wednesday you don't want to go past the burger!"}
{"text":"Best lunch in liberty. Delicious sandwiches but also very slow. Call ahead for takeout or plan to stay a while."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8/10
Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 7.5/10

A nice cozy spot in Liberty Village, Merci Mon Ami has baguette sandwiches all week and daily specials (i.e. taco tuesday) if you so desire.

The food is good, and the portions are fair. The only caveat is the service is slow, so be prepared to go over your hour lunch break if you want to eat here. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: baguette sandwiches are great, and service is nice but slow."}
{"text":"A great little lunch spot that is always coming up with new and interesting specials. Make sure to look on their Twitter feed for Tuesday and Wednesday specials!"}
{"text":"I won't be able to say enough good things about this place. I'm working here in Liberty Village for a month so I'm trying to eat at as many lunch places as possible during my time here. I had originally planned on coming here on a Tuesday until I read reviews about their Wednesday burger. Boy, I'm glad I waited.
 The burger comes with either fries or a salad or both. I chose to have the 1/2 fries -1/2 salad combo. The fries were superb, light, crispy, not greasy and expertly seasoned with both salt and pepper. The salad was composed of mixed greens with chopped tomatoes, lightly toasted walnuts, dried cranberries, chopped dry apricots and yellow pepper. Delicious. And the dressing! So good!! I think it was sesame oil with rice vinegar, but I'm not sure. 
The burger was delightful as well, cooked to perfection.
The music is great, the atmosphere inviting and the food amazing. Worth the trip, whether you're within walking distance or not. The service was of the highest quality. It's just a place that you'd want to hang out in - at least in my own opinion."}
{"text":"I had worked with Kevin from Merci Mon Ami for my 2 day corporate event of 350 people. I chose this caterer because he was very efficient in communication and worked with us in terms of budget and menu until my team and I were truly happy. We had 350 boxed lunches with a wrap and salad inside. Everyone at our conference praised the salad (there's something about his salad dressing that combines sweet and sour and compliments the greens and the little fruit pieces in his salad) and they loved the wraps. We ordered a variety of: Eggplant Parmesan, Grilled Veg, Tuna, Honey/Pesto Chicken, Roast Beef, Pastrami. However, in my opinion, their best wrap is the turkey breast-- but our budget did not permit us to buy 350 of the turkey. One thing to note is that I had forgotten to specify Gluten Free Options to Kevin, but the day of the event, he had prepared 5 Gluten Free Options. This saved the day as one of our sponsors had a celiac allergy. Another thing to note is that on the day of the event, Kevin had prepared a little breakfast box for me and 2 boxes of my favorite-- turkey. My overall experience with this company was a 10/10 because of the little things the owner did that really exemplified that he cared. We also had several last minute changes that Kevin gladly complied with. His staff-- Felipè-- has also phenomenal. He solely worked my event and was very efficient in restocking food, refilling water jugs etc. Our conference was a very high calibre event with professionals and recruiters from the NBA, NHL, Blue Jays, CWHL etc. They praised Merci Mon Ami's food and service just as much as I do."}
{"text":"One of my favourites in LV. Casual vibe, big harvest table, amazing burgers. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review by first stating that I have only eaten at MMA on numerous Wednesdays for their burger special, and I have never been on any other day or eaten anything else but their Feature Burger. 

HISTORY/ABOUT: A cute little bistro located in Liberty Village and part of the Village Market building. Fully customizable venue set up for private functions. Big lunch crowd as they specialize in sandwiches on baguettes and specialty breads, and are easy for take out for all the Liberty peeps on the go. A three course prix fixe dinner is also available on the last Saturday of every month. 

DÉCOR/AMBIENCE: Cute, quaint, clean and decorated well. Although it is small, the big wooden tables, high ceilings and neat decor make for a comfortable experience.  

FOOD QUALITY: Based on the 10+ burgers I have had here I have always been impressed by a) freshness of ingredients b) the big portion sizes 3) solid flavour 4) creativity

The Wednesday feature is not a small, smedium, or medium burger, this is a large burger. I am usually full until dinner after slaying lunch. Every week the chefs change the toppings all over the place so you never know what you're going to get, but you do know it will be solid. One thing however that is fairly constant is the presence of a pork element such as double smoked bacon or crisp prosciutto - zero complaints. I've had a jerk style burger there before, whacky slaws, relishes, chutneys, mayos and panko crusted deep fried cheeses - zero complaints.

As a side you can either have a mixed green salad, caesar, or bowl of soup depending on what's available that day. The mixed green salad is just that. The caesar has been hit or miss, its typically dressed well, fair amount of both bacon and croutons. They also serve it with a lime wedge which helps to elevate the acid level if you be on that tip.  I have never had the soup, the burger is really just so filling I couldn't stand the thought of pounding a bowl of hot liquid etc.

The feature burger is always creative, fun and well executed. When you go to order just write a big F on your order sheet, check off the salad or even 1/2 fries 1/2 salad if you like. Fries are nothing spectacular to me, but better than most....I guess....

PRICE POINT: Price point is reasonable. The Wednesday burger special with a side caesar salad is under $15. 

SERVICE: Good, no complaints. Order is taken efficiently and water is replenished as necessary. Consistent garbage electro music on Wednesdays is kind of a bummer, but you tune it out once you start eating. And that last bit about the music really has nothing to do with service so unsure why it is in this section =P

BATHROOMS: did not use.

FINAL THOUGHTS: an outstanding burger certainly worth a try if you have never experienced it. 

***Tips***
I would arrive just before noon to avoid the crazy Wednesday rush, or go well after 1 but risk them being sold out of burgers. 

If you are going to drink water do not buy a bottle (like I did my first time) as they replenish the bottles of water on the table and that water my friends is gratuit!"}
{"text":"Went there today for my first time.  And did not disappoint.  It was taco Tuesday.  Had the best tacos and salad ever!  New favourite spot I think for neighbourhood lunch"}
{"text":"Ordered their eggplant sandwich, waiting 10-15 minutes for it was okay but once received, the sandwich was pressed together as if it had been squashed, the eggplant was over fried, black and tasted burnt, the sandwich was oily. I had fries and side salad with it, the fries seemed to be re-fried 3 times, hard, crusty and not appetizing at all. The salad was oily and although they say it had berries nuts goat cheese and the works in it, it was soggy salad was not fresh, seemed as though it sat there for hours until they gave it to me. DISSAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  The burger and souvlaki meal are well-priced and generous.  The tacos initially weren't anything special, but I do have high standards for Mexican food and they did get better.  There are also $5 pint specials.  It is totally worth it.  Everyone is so nice and service is always prompt even at the busiest of times.

Options for sides are great.  You can get half fries + salad, or a poutine (for an extra charge)/

The only catch is that the patio costs an extra dollar.  I was surprised initially, but I got over it."}
{"text":"I work in Liberty Village and every single Tuesday for the past two months I have come to this restaurant for their Tacos. They are absolutely amazing. And the bean salad is just to die for! I've never ordered any of the regular menu items as I always come for one of the Specials (Tacos on Tuesdays, Hamburgers on Wednesdays and Souvlaki on Thursdays) but judging by how good the specials are there's no doubt in my mind that everything else is amazing as well.  
This is more of an option for people that live or work in Liberty Village because it's only open Mon-Fri until 3:00PM but it is great. Awesome and fast service.  Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"After a lengthy wait among indifferent front-of-house staffers at nearby Mildred's, we decided we'd had enough and weren't going to take it anymore!  I am glad we did, because instead we moseyed on over to Merci Mon Ami and enjoyed a reasonably priced lunch in a warm atmosphere among people who seemed to enjoy working there.

Nestled away in a side street in expanding Liberty Village, Merci Mon Ami has a cute front patio (too cold last weekend for us), and stairs down into a square little deli-cum-bistro style room.

Because there was an FC game on Saturday, they had a small, set menu for FC-goers who are in a rush. Our options were limited to the house salad and a burger with choice of toppings. The servers were very open about this small menu, warning us before we got through the door.

We had one of each and enjoyed both. The salad had craisins and a really delicious but not too heavy vinagrette. They had creemore on tap so we said YESSIR to that too. The burger was really juicy and the fries were good too. Reasonably priced, good service, and good food. Now I want to go back for some of those special nights like burger night."}
{"text":"My favourite lunchtime place to go when I'm at work!  Their chicken pesto sandwich is actually out of this world.  I keep meaning to try other things on the menu, but I just can't give up an opportunity to eat this amazing sandwich whenever I go!  Comes with a skewer of fruit (3-4 cubes of melon, pineapple, a grape) and a small green salad with dried cranberries and apricots.  They use a sesame dressing, but I prefer regular balsamic which you can have on request.  Very reasonable - about $10 for the combo and it's a wonderful portion size; gets me through the day without feeling over stuffed.

Writing about it is making me crave it... mmmm, maybe will be stopping in for lunch today!"}
{"text":"I am giving one star just because of the pleasant atmosphere at this place. The customer service was less than acceptable.
 I work in Liberty Village and I heard very good reviews about the food Merci Mon Ami offers which was the reason why I went there during my lunch break.
After making it clear with the cashier that it takes about 10 minutes to receive our food, we sat down waiting to dine in. While waiting we realized that 5 people who ordered food after us received it before us.  After 15 minutes waiting, we asked if the food was coming out and we were assured that it was. After that I saw that she was taking out our sandwiches from the fridge that were going to be warmed up.  Who wants to pay nearly 12 bucks for a sandwich from the fridge and wait 20 minutes for them? - At least, not me!
After 20 minutes waiting for my lunch and a misunderstanding, I was returned my money and left. They never apologized for the wait and for the ruined lunch. 
I would not recommend this place, although they food may be good (I never had the chance to try it...)"}
{"text":"My review is purely about their catering services as I have never actually frequented the establishment. I was tasked with finding catered lunch of a meeting we were having in Liberty Village and this place fit the bill. The staff that I worked with were professional, and service was exactly what we asked for. 

I was asked to make boxed lunches for individuals for a meeting that they could take them on the go if they had to leave in a hurry at the end of the meeting. The other accommodation we needed was to make only about 15 lunches total. It turns out many Toronto based catering companies will not 1. deliver to Liberty Village, 2. do individually packaged lunch options, or 3. do small order catering. 

The sandwiches we received were a little more creative and well thought out than your average catered lunch sandwiches, and they had the option of fruit or pasta salads as sides, as well as cookies and chips."}
{"text":"Open on a Saturday. FYI - There is nothing French about this place. No French food, no French desserts, no French drinks. Don't be misled by the name of the place. Though I do think that I saw an Eiffel Tower decoration on the wall. :P

The servers were all very nice. The food was nothing notable. I wouldn't choose this place based on the food. 


Theres like two salads and an eggplant dish. Aside from that it's all meat.

There's a patio dining area facing a parking lot and also spacious seating area inside.

 inside is not wait service.

Ps if you check in on Yelp you get a free soft drink"}
{"text":"As you can probably tell, I've been working out in Liberty Village recently; from what I understand, it's an up and coming neighbourhood with real potential for good, unique and friendly restaurants.  \"Merci mon ami\" certainly fits the bill.  A good place to grab lunch either in, or to go, this place calls itself a \"Paris Bistro\", but is frankly friendlier, brighter and more spacious than any bistro in Paris that I went to.  The space has minimal, yet smartly chosen décor that welcomes its patrons to linger, and the big wooden tables are good for spreading out your lunch.  There is a good selection of sandwiches presented in the window, literally tied up with bows (cute!).  Most of the sandwiches come in a white or brown baguette, or white or brown wrap option.  I chose the eggplant parm on brown baguette.  I'm still new to Toronto, so sometimes, I don't know how much things cost - so, when my to-go order came to $12, I simply thought: \"that's an expensive sandwich\".  My food was nicely packaged in a lunch box for me, which when I opened, was delighted to find: my hot sandwich, a skewer of fresh fruit, and a good sized mixed greens salad.  The sesame vinegarette that came on the side is something I wish the Bistro would sell.  I would buy it to use on my salads at home, no question.

My sandwich, while a bit thin on the actual eggplant, was delicious!  It came topped with caramelized onions and mushrooms that had a great punch.  I even ate the sundried tomatoes, which I usually hate; the flavours were just a great combination!  The service was quick, considering the lunch box was put together fresh; the proprietor was super friendly, and seemed to know several regular patrons.  The $12 lunch was extremely filling, and there were several other sandwiches that I want to go back and try.  Overall, cute place with unpretentious, tasty food - Merci!"}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming, as Merci Mon Ami is my favourite lunch spot in my work neighbourhood. The souvlaki hot plate is always delicious and I've never regretted ordering the feature salad or the burrito, either. In my experience the service is always fast and friendly - they even remember who I am and what I like to order, despite the fact that I'm not a regular customer. Even today, after I hadn't been to the place in a couple of months, it was like I'd gone there yesterday. I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch on a sunny Thursday afternoon with a bunch of friends. We all ordered the chicken kebabs special and everybody loved them.

They are a generous portion of kebabs and come with a nicely done greek salad and tasty fresh cut fries - all for under $15, notbadface at all. There was tons of seating including a patio and the service was fast and friendly. I am looking forward to my next visit, hopefully soon."}
