{"text":"Great tasting pizza! The sauce is the best. They usually deliver pretty quick asking as there is no special sporting events going on."}
{"text":"We have had  many take-out pizzas from here, and all were good. Importantly, the order was hot and ready when stated. I especially like the white chicken pizza with spinach and bacon. The crust is really good and crunchy, and the toppings are fresh and well done. We plan to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Mm mm pizza has amazing food. Let's start there The only issue I get with them is I never get a complete order. Out of the last 20 orders and we order from them all the Time we received 3 correct orders. We order the chicken fiesta salad every time and they never give us the chips for the salad which doesn't sound like the end of the world however order a pizza and let someone forget to put cheese on it and you will see what I mean Their service is great on the phone and also delivery but their consistency is absolutely horrible. I call and ask every time if the chips are still supposed to come with it and they say yes every time and they offer to bring them to me however I would like to put them on my salad when I am eating it. Not eat the chips after I'm done!!!!! Very frustrating mm mm pizza !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First, they were slow and uninformative on the phone.  Second, they called back to make an adjustment to our order.  Third, after 1.5h of not receiving our food, I called them and they had no recollection of our order.  They did offer to \"put it in at the top of the list\" - we decided to take our business to Luciano's."}
{"text":"We relocated from Maryland to Pittsburgh and since we didn't relocate with the food from our previous home, we had to eat out for a few days. We were just riding past there, realized that we haven't eaten for a few hours, and decided to stop by (we love pizza)lol. Glad we did! We don't even get pizza from anywhere else now (we have tried a few). We live just minutes from Mm Mm Pizza and my family and I just love love love their pizza amongst other items on the menu. My children love cheese or pepperoni pizza but my husband and I love the Italian meat lovers pizza. We can not get enough of their pizza and wings! We would recommend this place to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"The most consistently good take out pizza I have ever had. It's going on 10 years since I ordered my first pie from them, and they have never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Living at a hotel for a couple months, I ordered delivery from this place quite frequently, and the delivery time was as promised each and every time, with food still being tasty and hot.  From having lived in Brooklyn, let me tell you that the pizza tastes great here, and I can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in canonsburg!  Dylan is without a doubt the best pizza delivery guy in the biz.  They should give him a raise and the award of best delivery guy ever.  Try the Mac and cheese bites they are fabulous !"}
{"text":"Great small local pizza shop.  They are not the most popular shop and are tucked away on the back-side of a building, but I really enjoy their pizza.  We regularly will order a pizza and breadsticks and spend around $11 with an Enjoy book coupon and the quality of the pizza is great.    In regards to the style of the pizza, the crust is airy and light; crispy on the bottom but fluffy inside.  They do use more sauce than some other places, but I enjoy their sauce, which is a little thick/chunky and on the sweeter side.  The cheese is good quality, as are the rest of their toppings.  Additionally, their pizzas are a good value.  I've ordered pizza from the Red Onion which is just a few doors down, as they offer a takeout large pizza deal, but was very disappointed at the small size of the pizza.  MM MM Pizza's does not skimp on the size of the pizza or the cheese and toppings.  The employees are also very pleasant.  They answer the phone quickly and do not rush your order.  I can also always understand them over the phone and they always give me the amount of the bill before I hang up.  I always pick up my pizza and the employees are very respectful and provide quick service when I go to pick up the pizza.  Additionally, the shop is very clean (unlike a lot of other pizza places in the area) and the pizza is always ready when I arrive to pick it up.  Overall, this is one of your favorite local pizza places.  It may not be a fancy brick-oven pizza, but it is consistently great quality for a great price."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good. I would not bother ordering  a calzone.  Mainly dough and cheese with very sparse fillings.   Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was in town from central pa. and found this shop on Yelp. The reviews were good so we thought we'd give it a try. Had a pizza with sausage and pepperoni and it was excellent. Great well cooked crust, tasty sauce, abundance of cheese and the toppings were fresh. I give them 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from Mm Mm Pizaa for a birthday part and everyone there loved it! I was on a diet so I didn't get to try it, but wish I did as people asked where we got the pizza from."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened when I was in high school....one of my good friends was one of the first employees here. I love a large pie with light sauce and pepperoni from here it ALWAYS hits the spot ALWAYS. The cheese is always cooked just rite and the pepperoni is never burned to death. I also enjoy the breadsticks and fries and also the pepperoni rolls. My wife is a big fan of the hoagies esp the philly cheese steak hoagie."}
{"text":"Consistent and fast. I'm a local and have ordered here more times than I'd like to admit, but subs and pizza are my favorite here. The people who work here are also very friendly, nice, and know how bad you want some pizza."}
{"text":"Review for delivery order:  We placed a delivery order to a hotel. The order was accurate, delivered promptly, and the pizza was great. Crust, cheese, sauce.. all delicious.   We did also order wings which were about average (a big on the soggy side), but it's a Pizza place, not a wing place."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Ordered pizza, sub, breadsticks. They didn't ring up or deliver the breadsticks. They rung up the pizza wrong and charged for extra toppings then wanted me to send it back for a new one instead of just adjust the price. The manager even argued with me about what we ordered. Won't order delivery from here again. May order take out though, as we do like the food."}
{"text":"Okay so when I moved here from NJ Mm Mm's pizza was my favorite, but they have really upset me the last few times I have ordered. They left off every topping I wanted in my salad tonight and I still got charged for it. I think i'm done for a while with this place. I don't even write yelp reviews but I just feel taken advantage of at this point."}
{"text":"Ordered several pizzas for a work party..cheeseburger, buffalo chicken, supreme and taco....fast delivery..inexpensive and really good! Will order again and keep passing menus thru out the office. Yum!"}
{"text":"Order here, fairly regularly and never disappointed with quality or experience. They are pleasant when they answer phone and delivery is quick. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"awesome pizza.  good deals, so be sure to ask about specials or find one of their flyers.  i was a delivery driver here back in high school/college so i have an allegiance but it is legitimately good pizza."}
{"text":"I am new to this area and was looking for a new pizza place to try, well this was it! i reminds me of this pizza place where I'm originally from. It is just perfect amount of cheese sauce topping and not too much crust. a+ from me"}
{"text":"I eat here quite often,  the high quality food and fresh handmade sauce is to die for. It's always good to be able to get great food but it's even better when you show up to a restaurant and receive great service. The staff is super friendly here in Canonsburg. They definitely put the customer first. If you're ever in the area you should definitely stop in this place and try it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the South Hills, and it's super cheap. 2 large plain pizzas(8-cut) for something like $10 or $11. The stuff is pretty greasy, though, but I think it tastes awesome. Very cheesy and the sauce is good. Overall, bang-for-your-buck, this was one of my favorite pies when I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I don't care for their pizza all that much. My husband likes their specialty buffalo chicken pizza. We do enjoy their wings. They are a nice size and come smothered in sauce (always a plus). My go to is always the Pittsburgh hot sausage sub. It's a hot sausage smothered with sauce, onions, peppers, cheese, and topped with French fries. What's not to love?? I wouldn't recommend their pizza, but they have plenty of other options on the menu that are good. Plus, they offer delivery, which is hard to come by in Canonsburg!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaiian chicken pizza. When I opened it the pizza had raisins in a big puddle of brown goo and no chicken. Raisins. I took it back and asked for a pepperoni pizza instead (which cost less) but they said they could only replace it with the same kind of pizza. So they gave me another of the same with chicken this time but still with brown goo and raisins, just slightly less. Seriously who does that? It was a couple years ago so maybe they've improved but I wouldn't bet pizza night on it."}
{"text":"We were picking up pizza to take to our boy's house. This was the closest pizza place. They were pretty busy when we went in. Their phone was ringing non-stop. It is not a dine in establishment. People were coming in to pick up orders. We checked out the menu and ordered 2 pizzas. We ordered a pick up special of a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza that was also a special. There were chairs to wait in which was nice. It took about 15-20 mins to get the pizza and it was truly hot out of the oven. The pizza was still hot when we got to our boy's house.  Both pizzas looked good with nice amounts of sauce and cheese. I chose the pepperoni. It was a bit greasy for me but I used napkins to soak it up. The crust was a hand tossed crust. It was airy and chewy, not dense. The cheese was gooey. There were a lot of pepperoni on the pizza and they had a good flavor. It was a good pizza, but not outstanding. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Again and again this place makes consistently good pizzas.  Just yesterday evening I got two medium pepperoni and onion pizzas.  They were made to perfection. While \"craft-like\" shops create some delicoious high-end frou-frou pies, mm mm consistently delivers a daily staple that you never tire of - and at a good price.  All without a wood burning or coal fired oven!"}
{"text":"Very good quality pizzas. The prices are great. Always use one of their coupons inside the store or from past take outs. Less than 9 bucks for a large plain take out. Their wings are amazing. Highly recommend. The pizza isn't in the \"amazing\" category, thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is probably the best bang-for-your-buck pizza place in the South Hills area, but that's primarily on the strength of the $10 2 large cheese pizza carry-out special.  The prices are otherwise more or less in line with the other pizza places in the area.  Perhaps due to that fact, the cheese pizza is the only thing I've ever had from Mm Mm Pizza.  Fortunately, it's good enough that I've had it again and again!  If you've had local chain pizza before, then you'll know exactly what you're getting with Mm Mm Pizza.  Crust that's crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Impressive (and comical at times) amounts of gooey molten cheese.  A thin layer of ever-so-slightly sweet tomato sauce.  All made before your eyes in about 10 minutes or less.  And then there's the huge grin on your face when you devour your first slice.  Hipster cuisine this is not -- so if you're looking for fancy wood-fired all-organic ambrosia-of-the-gods-in-pizza-form, then go somewhere else.  But if you're looking for decent, standard chain pizza that's a cut above Little Caesar's (yet costs the same), then by all means give this place a try.  Your stomach (not to mention your wallet) will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Wow, it  has been a long time since I had Mm Mm.  Had a group playing soccer and afterwards the pizza showed up.  Good pizza, nice flavors and nice crust."}
{"text":"Love this pizza!!! The only pizza place that we order from. A deluxe is so loaded with toppings that one piece fills you up. Their specials with coupons can't be beat and they are so nice on the phone. It's also a plus they deliver to us because we are in the country."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm pizza is a staple at parties at my moms house.  The pizza is definitely above average and my parents talk about how it is reasonably priced.  They have some good fresh toppings, we generally get pepperoni and peppers."}
{"text":"They do NOT skimp on the toppings here.  Hands down in this subjective review, this is the best ratio of toppings of the local shops for 90% of their pizzas.  Only 1 other place has a better pizza, but it is of a type not offered here. The sauce and dough are superb, and the cheese never has that freezer-burned taste to it.  You want extra topping amounts, you'll get it.  The pepperonis are good and not offensively greasy, but let's be fair, pepperoni isn't a health food. The staff has been cheerful, happy, and most importantly politely respectful.  You can tell they enjoy working there.  The atmosphere is bright and clean.  The prices are fair and pizzas are ready in good time, and that's even when they're busy.  I recommend them. As a tip (not in the \"Tip\" section), try the Taco and Philly Cheesesteak pizzas!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here twice. We have ordered pizza, salads, and wings, and none of us were impressed with any of it. The pizza was just meh. The wings were just ok, but wings from a pizza place usually are. The salads were hot, which was gross. Delivery came on time and prices were decent but quality just isn't there. We won't be ordering from here again."}
