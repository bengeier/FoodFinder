{"text":"I've made numerous visits to Bunner's and although it does have some good offerings, I wouldn't say it's 'A-OK' by any means. Firstly, it is very difficult to produce great baked goods that are both vegan and gluten-free. It defies the laws of food science. That doesn't mean that Bunner's doesn't hit the mark on some things. 

Their date bars are delicious, but everybody knows that date bars are a no brainer. The cupcakes are tasty with generally a good texture but far too heavy on the agave. A quarter of a cupcake is more than enough for me! They have been known to offer mini cupcakes here but I have found it to be a rarity, as confirmed by one of the staff. 

And while we are on the topic of staff, I can confirm that on each and every occasion I have been here (5 times total), the staff was rude and cold. For example, we stopped in one Saturday morning to pick up a big order for a party and we were bluntly told they do not provide any kind of carry home bags. A huge inconvenience. Why not offer eco-friendly, vegan totes which customers can purchase?

The cinnamon buns are heavy and more akin to bricks. The empanadas are really good, I will say. The pastry is spot on flakey and tasty. 

Personally, I'll pass on Bunner's. Been there, done that."}
{"text":"The cinnamon bun, soft serve ice cream, truffles and brownie all taste great - the cupcakes were a bit underwhelming. 

The prices are high, and the portions for the cinnamon buns and cupcakes are huge - they sell half-sized ones at special events but don't see why they don't sell them regularly - health conscious eaters are more likely to buy the reasonable-sized dessert, and more often. 

I give it 3 stars because of the prices and service - the employees can be a bit rude at times and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, the cupcakes are moist and not too heavy. I love cupcakes-dessert but dont have sweets that often because I always feel gross and heavy after eating regular cupcakes, however I dont get that feeling eating desserts at bunners.

Prices are a bit high...but I dont mind paying an extra buck or 2 for quality and health conscious ingredients."}
{"text":"Honestly their soft serve ice cream is simple but it's the best. The vanilla and chocolate swirl is the way to go. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Interesting variety of cakes and pastries. The best part is that they are all vegan! Had the chubby bunny which is a carrot cake with cream filling. It was very tasted and I didn't even realise that it is vegan. Bunner's certainly changed my impression of a vegan diet as you can also enjoy sweet treats while being healthy at the same time!"}
{"text":"I'm torn with Bunners, so I'm giving this place 3 stars for a few reasons: 1) their pastries (or at least the ones I've tried) just aren't really the best in the city. I find their cupcakes dry, their creamies, while delicious, super super sweet after two bites, and their butter tarts really aren't that great either. Then again, I guess that's what happens when baking with vegan ingredients. BUT, other bakeries do it better - vegan and g-free. 2) Their soft serve ice cream - it's delicious, but at the same time, I don't really want to know (or maybe I do?) what chemicals are in there. But then again, it takes me back to being a kid and getting soft serve in the summer. It tastes good and nostalgic. 3) Their bread is AMAZING. While I don't like paying $8 for a loaf of bread, there's something to be said about freshly baked, straight from the oven, loaves. You just can't get that with grocery store bought gluten free bread. 

And the reason why this place does not get 4 stars - they charge you, no matter how much you're buying, to use their debit machine. They tack on an additional 10 cents. Not a big deal, but if I'm paying $8 for a loaf of bread and $4+ for a cupcake and more, I really think they should eat the cost of that 10 cents. Sorry Bunners, but on principal, I will continue to eat rice cakes with my almond butter instead of regularly buying your loaves."}
{"text":"First time here so I went with an assortment of cinnamon rolls,Vanilla cupcake and red velvet cupcake.  Very delicious but a little on the dry side for me. I went on a Saturday around 1pm.  The staff were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"The soft serve ice cream is okay, not great, but the mini-blueberry pies are delicious! And the raspberry crumb cake! Nom nom nom!
As a vegan, I am very grateful to have this bakery in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I had a campfire cupcake and it was amazing.  I couldn't believe how many options they had, and everything looked delightful."}
{"text":"I agree with what everyone else has said about the cinnamon buns being overly sweet and super dense. It was also weirdly really really oily. Like it was coated in oil. The icing was nice but there was no cinnamon flavour. 

For vegan dessert, these are pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Not vegan or gluten free but this is my favourite bakery in Toronto; I can't walk past without buying a creamie!!!! And brace yourself for the summer when their soft serve takes over your entire life"}
{"text":"This place has the best cinnamon buns I have ever tasted. As someone that's lactose intolerant I also like that they have soy soft serve ice cream. The place looks pretty empty, I just would like more sitting area. You must have a bun."}
{"text":"Great gluten free goodies ! Celiac friendly as the whole place is GF(and vegan!), they do custom cakes and always have the order ready on time. My only complaint is they don't have bags--if I'm coming in and dropping 100$ on stuff I shouldn't have to run back to my car 3 times to load all the goodies because you don't have bags on hand! Or at least offer to have a staff assist me ! Geez !"}
{"text":"Just \"meh\"...I keep going back because i'm vegan and get very excited whenever I can eat anything different. Every time I get something I am either just ok with it or I throw it in the garbage. I am not a picky eater but I have some standards about my baked goods...

So far i've tried...
Cinnamon roll which was more like a cinnamon pound cake. It was tasty but not a cinnamon bun...

The soft serve Ice cream - it was terrible. I'm sorry. It tasted like chemicals.

A cupcake - It weighed like 3 pounds and was dry. 

The butter tart and It was alright.


I think of myself of a connoisseur of vegan junk food (I've had tasty treats all over the world...) and Bunner's just keeps letting me down.

I like to see vegan businesses succeed but they just need to work on the consistency of their products."}
{"text":"Being gluten-intolerant, I'm pretty hard-pressed finding places where I can eat or have snack that I can trust, let alone enjoy. Not everything Bunners serves is my favourite, but I have lots of favourites there....cupcakes, the Supersonic cookie and many muffins. This place is my go-to spot. When I take dessert to my non-vegan, gluten-eating friends or to parties, I come here. Everyone is always more than satisfied (and they never know the difference). Worth trying...again and again."}
{"text":"this vegan gluten free bakery in the midst f kensignton market is decent. I have been to this location a few times and I haven't been incredibly impressed with their products. I have tried their savory pocket.. it was kinda dry and not anything special. I have tried a few of their cupcakes, nothing special and the icing is a tad sweet. Their creamies is just bleh a tad dry and not really flavourful.I also tried their waffle with ice cream which was decent the waffle was dry and not that tasty the ice cream was tasty. If i am in the area and feel like a treat I may stop by, but it's not a real go to place."}
{"text":"Vegan dessert Heaven! an escape from the normal \"is there egg or dairy in this?\"- order without care. Also, my  non-vegans have absolutely loved items I've bought from here including, the soft serve(summer only), chocolate \"cheese\" cake, and the brownies(to die for!). a must stop when in kensington!"}
{"text":"Pro: Gluten free and vegan options

Cons: 1. Too much sugar, too sweet.

            2. Woaw, $24 for a cinnabon + 2 small samosas  
                + 1 regular cookie."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to getting a cake for someone's birthday from Bunner's so I called a week ahead.  The person I spoke to told me I didn't have to order in advance.  So I called 3 days ahead.  No one picked up or returned my call.  I called again the next day (wednesday) and they told me they didn't deliver on Fridays but wouldn't get it to me on Thursday because it wasn't 48 hours in advance.  They offered to cab it to me (at least a $35 cab ride) on friday.  I am vegan but I won't bother coming back here, given this terrible customer service."}
{"text":"i'm a sucker for 'cinnabon' but always feel guilty for having it. bunner's mini cinnamon buns are amazing, great portion but they go too hard on the icing! muffins are great, very filling and delicious! always have to make a stop here whenever i'm in the area"}
{"text":"Tried both the vanilla and double chocolate cupcakes

Delicious! Would definitely recommend for a little vegan treat. Icing was a bit too sweet for my liking, but otherwise I am very happy with the service and quality of the establishment. Would recommend if in the area!"}
{"text":"The bake shop is cute and has a lot of options of vegan and gluten free options, which is good. Tried their dates square, it's kind of sweet for me, but it matches well with americano."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a gluten free alternative but their baked goods are really heavy. And way too sweet. I love sweet stuff but this is overkill. Cupcakes are not moist borderline dry."}
{"text":"Runner's Bake shop had a good reputation and I tried. I did not like their cup cake. They are vegan and gluten free shop. If you are okay with dairy or wheat, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"I normally go for savoury over sweet, however, all that changed while visiting Toronto and I found out about Bunners. The cupcakes are awesome. The frosting is super creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I expected the rest to be dry and crumbly, but it was moist and delicious! I also had the pumpkin tarts and they were awesome also!

This will be a regular stop when I'm in the Kensington Market in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Right after the Christmas/New Year's holidays I was visiting Toronto and a couple of my usual go-to gluten-free places were closed, probably recovering from many extra hours of baking to feed the gluten intolerant masses. While in Kensington Market I noticed Bunner's and bought a couple of cupcakes. I'd wanted a savory pocket pastry but the counter assistant told me they were pretty heavy on soy products so I passed on that. I ate half a cupcake and all I could taste was sugar. Poor bakers think that overdoing the sugar will hide the fact that the item is not great. It doesn't work for me. I truly dislike really sweet stuff. It's bad for us, it puts our bellies out of whack and it's so unnecessary. Almond Butterfly and Defloured are so much better that they are on an entirely different playing field."}
{"text":"Bunner's has been a life saver for this gluten free girl. When I gave up wheat over 5 years ago I thought I may never be able to have a normal tasting sandwich again. Their bread is the best gluten free bread I have ever tasted, but you'll definitely want to get there early in the day to make sure you snatch up a loaf before they're all gone. Other standouts are the cinnamon buns, brownies, creamies, supersonic cookies, vegan mac & cheese and the double chocolate cake. I find that he cupcakes have a very strong chickpea flour aftertaste, so I tend to avoid those, but I love everything else. If you're at the Kensington location in the summer don't forget to treat yourself to the vegan soft serve in a gluten free cone. I have been known to go out of my way to grab one on the way home from work."}
{"text":"For being Gluten Free, vegan, etc., i was skeptical to try it -- and man the Brownie was delicious!!

That is all i tried and i would def try it again -- however, the price!! haha, be careful xD but love it"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Everything about this place is yummy. I tried their popular cinnamon bun, the banana split cupcake but IMO, the soft serve ice cream in a cone wins. All gluten free and all vegan!! Very fair prices for the quality of the sweets. I have but one concern..this place is dangerously close to me."}
{"text":"We used to make treks up to the Junction specifically to go to Bunner's and now that there's one closer by, I go every week!

I can't have wheat or dairy, so the only bakery for me before Bunner's was BabyCakes in New York City! So if you're like me this place is a godsend and pretty much everything on offer is fantastic. Standouts are: the bread, butter tarts, cinnamon buns, full-sized fruit pies, brownies, and date squares. Even if you can eat \"normal\" food you'll love many things here. The maple scone is particularly a stand-out.

The soft-serve ice cream is a bit of a revelation, especially on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit Bunner's for the first time, I'd been meaning to go for so long. This isn't my first vegan bakery experience and definitely was not my best. Maybe it was just the high hopes I had based off of reviews and pictures from Bunner's. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon.

Cupcake - dense and slightly unpleasant vanilla flavour (didn't taste natural). The icing wasn't bad. Enjoyable but I've had much better. 
Cinnamon Roll - Icing was yummy! Surprisingly it didn't have a strong cinnamon flavour, and the roll itself was not very good... it was dense and flavourless.

I'm glad I came to try their treats, but they won't be my first choice when craving vegan goodies."}
{"text":"Tried their cinnamon square/bun and a chocolate s'mores square with the vegan frosting at this year's Veg Fest on Queens Quay. First time trying, and I am no stranger to vegan baked goods. Had my husband and two other friends with us. We all ordered the same thing, all all ended up NOT finishing them. We threw them out. They were horrible. Very dense and hard, so overly sweet, quite honestly both were gross and very overpriced. I sure as heck won't be going back there and do not recommend this place if you're looking for tasty pastries or cakes. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to come here for a really long time, despite not being vegan, gluten free is healthier and the way to go. I decided to finally do it today, because I realized a little while ago that the Augusta location is only 2 km from my work. 

The service was nice, and the cashier was able to answer all my ingredient-related questions.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they bake GF bread, and I picked it up. It was good for as good as GF bread can be. I also picked up a lemon cran muffin and the mini cinnamon bun, both which were really good, especially the cinnamon roll. However, if you know how regular pastries taste, I do think you can taste the difference, but it's not substantial. Essentially, the pastries are less \"fluffy\" and more dense. They are still fantastic, though. My only complaint is that the pastries are baked with margarine (of course), and although Earth Balance is a better margarine, it's still a margarine and margarine is garbage (like, it's really bad for you). If you have a pastry here once in a while, then don't feel bad. However, I assume that most people that come here probably use a lot of margarine.. so, sorry to break it to you people... I also wish they had tea/coffee, because it would go so well with the pastries. However, they say they used to carry it and it didn't sell well. I think they should try again! lol. Overall, I am pleased with my purchases. I bake GF at home (without margarine, and no butter either for the past while), but once in a while it's nice to be able to get it elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cinnamon bun was really tasty. There was a low selection of baked goods. Also, it would be nice to have a savoury items as well. The decor, presentation, and service was also lacking . I was expecting more from this place."}
{"text":"BEST vegan dessert place ever. I always have to take a trip there when im in the area. I recently tried their pumpkin soft serve \"ice cream\" and i was in HEAVEN ! It tastes like pumpkin pie but better ! The texture is soft but firm enough that it wont melt instantly. Their cupcakes are to die for. You wouldnt even know they were vegan honestly. 10/10"}
{"text":"I am not vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter. In fact I love meat. But that's beside the point. More than anything, I love good food, and Bunner's is my go to bakery stop in the Kensington Market. Sure there are cheaper places to buy sweets, but these satisfy everybody - the gluten free, veg heads, vegans, whatever crowd. And when I mean satisfy, I really mean leave breathless. The list of deliciousness from here is long and decadent, but suffice it to say that everything I have stuffed down my craw has left me wishing I smoked just so I could light one up afterwards and exhale contentedly. This is one of the few places where I can buy sweets, serve them to guests and not tell them that they are gluten free, vegan, not tested on animals, whatever, and everybody still wolfs them down.
Kudos to the chefs here for creating such masterpieces for everybody to enjoy. BTW if you are a glutton for punishment, they actually sell a cookbook with their recipes in it, but be prepared to put in some serious elbow grease and also to gain a few inches along the way."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever gone to Kensington Market and not stopped by Bunner's. I always find the people behind the cash super friendly and attentive despite some bad reviews on here. I got my husband a birthday cake (chocolate raspberry) from here last year and it was incredible. The smallest cake could honestly feed 10 people so its totally worth the money. I've also taken a baking class here and it was so much fun and super informative. Even though I'm not gluten free (just vegan), I definitely levelled up as a baker after :P
Their cupcakes are life changing and I have recently discovered the yogurt parfaits. Mmm."}
{"text":"I kept reading about their cinnamon buns so I decided to take the kids and try it today. I told the cashier that I had never been there before and I knew their cinnamon buns were popular and I asked her what else she could recommend. She wasn't helpful at all. I tried a cinnamon bun, supersonic cookie, and pumpkin chocolate chip muffin. I haven't tried the muffin yet. The cinnamon bun was ok. I am vegan and mostly gluten free. I have never seen anyone else offer a vegan, GF cinnamon bun before which is the only reason I think these are so popular. They are not delicious, they are pretty good. If you are looking for a Cinnabon type cinnamon bun...you will be disappointed. The supersonic cookie was really delicious. I would go again for the cookie but not for the cinnamon bun."}
{"text":"I am not overly sweet on baked goods, but I am quite impressed by the array of vegan and gluten-free treats at Bunner's. It is truly a bakery for anybody who enjoys homey, baked goods that aren't overly fancy in presentation or finesse, but taste just right.

In particular, I like their apple crumble muffin (with a generous crumble top!) and brownie. I have never made a vegan brownie that I enjoyed or that didn't come out like a puck; theirs is just like the \"real\" thing. I am so glad that I don't crave sweets, but if I did, Bunner's would be a go-to spot for me."}
{"text":"I took my time browsing Bunner's display case. Loaded with gluten-free gooey cinnamon rolls, butter tarts and frosting capped cupcakes I was beginning to lose my inhibition for healthy eating. They all looked so good but I had to settle for a personal favorite: red velvet cupcakes. 

The cake itself was light and airy but somehow noticeably starchy with a slight metallic aftertaste. Gluten-free baking is extremely hard to do well so this bit of unpleasantness gave me pause for concern. The cake's thick swirl of frosting added its intense sweetness to the experience.

I appreciate the effort to put forward a GF red velvet cake, but the end product I found rather unappetizing. Maybe next time I'll try a cinnamon roll?"}
{"text":"It is both the BEST of news that there is now a centrally-located Bunner's, and also the worst of news as now it's far too easy to indulge. Incredible products, congratulations folks."}
{"text":"First thing I want to start off by saying I am not vegan. I've been off gluten and dairy for about a week and have been craving desserts like crazy! And living in Mississauga I'm very limited, as there aren't many places that serve both gluten and dairy free goods. 

That's why I'm so glad I found Bunner's! I popped by yesterday during Pedestrian Day.
I got one of everything - a butter tart, a brownie, a cookie, a red velvet cupcake, a chocolate cupcake and a savoury pocket (aka a pizza pocket). Altogether it came up to about $30 - which is a little bit steep but I mean anything GF and vegan are pretty pricey anyways right? 
Regardless, everything was delicious it was definitely worth the price.

Everything tasted as it should, if not better! The only thing I didn't like was the savoury pocket. It was really crumbly and fell apart easily. Also, it took forever to heat up. I waited about 15-20 mins to get it. The lady on the counter was super apologetic so no complaints on her part. 

Bunner's was everything I expected and more! If you are vegan or non-vegan definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hi Bunners,

I was in your store a few weekends ago and I purchased a handful of items, each of which were packed separately in little white paper bags.  Of course, I had plans to walk around Kensington for the rest of the day, so as for a bag to place my handful of items.

I was bluntly told that no bags were provided because the store would like to be \"environmentally friendly\".  While I can understand this policy,  here are some options you might like to consider:
1) Offer environmentally friendly reusable totes that customers can purchase for $1
2) Offer slightly large recyclable brown paper bags in which people can place their individually packed

Frankly, it is a huge inconvenience to your customers to have to carry around individually packed little baggies all around the market.  A quick look on Yelp would indicate that other customers feel the same way.  

Thank you for your consideration."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or gluten free (anymore) but these pastries were delicious! I wanted to try everything but settled on the supersonic cookie (amazing) and the cinnamon bun. Both were fantastic although I liked the cookie more. :)"}
{"text":"Guilt free sweets and not too far from campus!! Bunners is my go to bakery. Mini buns are always a must... Plus the cream filled cookie sandwiches, and pretty much anything else with that coconut cream frosting is also super yum"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan bakery located in Kensington Market. I got the cinnamon bun, brownie, and ice cream. The ice cream is soy-based, but it was a little too sweet for my liking. The real hero is the cinnamon bun, I could eat it for days

Everything tasted fresh, you could tell it was made in-house. 

Highly recommend for vegans and non-vegans alike!"}
{"text":"I stop here all of the time while in Kensington. They have a good selection of sweets and the best frosting in town. On the pricier side, but very worth it."}
{"text":"that chocolate salted butterscotch cupcake was to die for.  it was a tad sweet but damn im addicted lol and now im craving...  happy that its gluten free and dairy free pleasently surprised."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I'm not even vegan or gluten free. It's just better! Try any donut and you'll be perplexed that baked goods ever contained dairy of wheat!"}
{"text":"Needed to satisfy a sweet craving while exploring Kensington neighborhood in Toronto.  Benner's hit the spot - vegan and gluten free to boot.

We had the Passion Fruit Cupcake - delicious, filling - definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.

We also enjoyed the Ginger Kombucha from  VAMS.

Good stop in Kensington."}
{"text":"So great for gluten free! Good prices and the supersonic cookie is def worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing Bunner's bake shop for a while now. They are a good sized bakery in Kensington market that sells vegan and gluten free products. While trying to observe a gluten and dairy reduced diet, I find I'm often disappointed with the texture of gluten free breads and other baked goods which often leave a soggy slimy texture in my mouth. I was optimistic that Bunner's would offer flavourful and texturally appealing products.

There is a great selection of breads, cupcakes, squares, brownies and cookies for sale. My eyes were drawn to the brownie as well as the ginger molasses cookies. Upon asking what the best selling product was, I was also compelled to purchase a cinnamon roll.

The ginger molasses cookie was soft and had a nice gingery flavour but was too crumbly and lacked the chewiness that I seek out from similar cookies made with wheat flour. The cinnamon roll was visually appealing and not bad texturally but was quite sweet for my liking. Of the 3 items purchased, the brownie was my favourite. The brownie was moist, chewy, chocolatey, and not too sweet. 

The verdict? I would definitely recommend Bunner's if you're looking for vegan or gluten free baked goods. I personally will come back at some point for more of their brownies and perhaps to try a cupcake or two. 

3.25 stars.

{"text":"I used to come here quite frequently when I had classes at Toronto Western Hospital. I came mainly for their incredible vegan yogurt parfaits ($5.50), which sell out very quickly and are only sometimes available :'( I absolutely adore these parfaits since they are so large and so filling with all the nuts and fresh fruits (not the generic soggy berries blah lalala that you find in Sobeys/Metro parfaits -- here you get mangos, giant blueberries, etc). The \"yogurt\" part also has incredible texture - it's super smooth, less creamy than real dairy but still creamy, and light. And tastes sweeter than typical yogurt, but also has a pleasant slightly sour edge. I believe it's coconut based?

I've also had their cookies, which I was less a fan of. I found the cookies too dry and a tad too bitter (and I usually like bittersweet baked goodies)."}
{"text":"I am not vegan and I am an avid gluten consumer who's always had bad experiences with GF or Vegan things. Especially baked goods. But it was my vegan colleague's birthday and we decided to get the cherry cheesecake here at Bunner's. 

THIS CHERRY CHEESECAKE BLEW OUR MIND AWAY.

It tasted like any other cheesecake but SO much better. I'm dying to revisit and try other patries and cakes because although I had a big slice, I did not feel sick or heavy like other cakes. It's really easy on the stomach, and"}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan. In fact, I ate meat last night . 

I'm almost late for work and must write this review because HoLY smokes I am so impressed!!

At first I tried a Super sonic gypsy Cookie from lit espresso with a nice blueberry rooibos tea. What a great combo! The cookie was so good I dreamed about it all day and had to go back to ask them if they made them in house . Nope ! They were Bunner Super Sonic Gypsy cookies !!! So I made a trip to Bunner  to buy a box of cookies and decided to try their Mac and cheese which is vegan and gluten free of course . I really did not expect to like it because I am a huge carbie cheese lover. This morning I popped it in my oven and all I can say is holy smokes this Mac and cheese is like crack and cheese . It's so CREAMY and delicious !! I am so impressed with it especially because I always thought gluten free pasta was the weirdest thing... BUT this was cooked to perfection it wasn't mushy like I thought it would be. This gluten free Mac was perfect and aldente.  
Oh, I'm also one of those weirdos who love ketchup. I added nothing extra this mac and cheese because it was perfect in every way .

Thanks Bunner !"}
{"text":"I've been to their original Junction location once, and Bunner's opening a Kensington shop certainly makes it easier for downtown rats to get their fix of the much-hyped gluten-free vegan-friendly baked confections.

Bunner's of Kensington is much bigger than their tiny Junction base, though most of the space is taken up by the open kitchen wafting of constant sweet baking. Of the area left for customers to huddle around and drool over the counter, there is plenty of space for a couple of small tables for those who want to eat in, but instead stupidly enough only a bench by the window is provided. There's no valid excuse.

Wasn't quite impressed with the stuff I had before over there (best butter tarts? meh, average), so let's see how this one goes. Their cinnamon buns are said to be the best in the city. I don't get it. At all. Sticky? Oh yes. But it was more like a cake than a bun, it was dense, and damnit it was dry and heavily sweet. It certainly did not compute with my expectations of what a cinnamon bun is.

When I finished that beast, I swear I was craving gluten. Not just any kind of gluten; I wanted BEER. That damned overhyped cinnamon whatever had me thirsty for beer, and definitely not the gluten-free kind. I don't think I have ever ate anything that made want beer as badly as I did with Bunner's cinnamon concoction.

Hmm, soy-based soft serve ice cream... I wouldn't mind trying it, but I couldn't imagine how that would work. Spare me the Bunner's cult hype; as much as I would like to like it, their stuff is really not as divine as the local vegan/gluten-free/hipster crowd make them out to be.

{"text":"#CinnamonRoll #Overpriced #TooSweet 

While size is generous the flours and flavors used are not pleasant.  They try to hide that by an overly sweet icing and loads of cinnamon. The roll is quite dense. The sugar (glycemic index) is extremely high. Possibly higher that #Cinnabon

{"text":"I was/am obsessed with their soft serve but the ice cream cone keeps shrinking!  I bought one today and was eating it outside of the shop: thinking how sad I was that it was so small. Then woman who was behind me in line came out of the shop and up to me and complained to me about the size of my cone!  I couldn't believe she was thinking the exact same thing!  We both agreed that it had shrunk to the point where we both were unable to justify the price for the product."}

learn how to greet people and work on your communication skills... pathetic. 
Would not recommend and would not go back"}
{"text":"I stopped by Bunner's for a quick treat and got a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin. The pumpkin flavour was very good but it stuck to wrapper a lot. There was a good variety but cupcakes were a little pricey. We also asked them to cut the muffin in half and she said no because all they had was a plastic fork but we made do anyway."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely a place to check out.  It being vegan and gluten-free was very interesting.  My girlfriend and I came here; ordered the cinnamon bun, caramalita square, red velvet cupcake and coconut carrot cupcake.  
First impression: so so so so sweet, we could not eat it all in one sitting.  The cinnamon bun we didn't think was very good.  The red velvet cupcake I thought was pretty good for being vegan.  My girlfriend loved the square.
Price wise: pretty expensive for what you get.  Those 4 treats put us up to over $20.
This place would be good for vegans who can't normally indulge in regular desserts."}

It was so refreshing and nice to know that I could eat anything and everything in this shop because their products are made with chickpea flour, not like most gf treats which are made from almonds etc.  Everything here is sooooo delicious - I just wish you were in Alberta!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan bakery! You have to try their pizza muffins. Absolutely the best. Came back one time to grab a whole box. Totally worth it."}

- VERY overpriced (bought 3 things that ended up being $18)
- lack of variety. They had maybe a selection of 4-5 kinds to choose from? TBH I had a hard time choosing because everything they had were so standard, such as cinnamon roles, bran muffins, chocolate chip cookies.
- their customer service is very lacking. They had a lot of staff that were chatting diligently in the back and when we came in and asked some questions one girl came to the counter and rushed us like crazy, answering our questions with basic yes/no and was constantly looking back to the kitchen staff and desperate to go back to their conversation and laughter."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé cette pâtisserie ! J'ai goûté au \"cinnamon bun\" et au biscuit au gingembre et réellement, ce dernier était délicieux ! Ils vendent du Kombucha artisanal ce qui est intéressant! Le service était bien et il était difficile de faire un choix parmis la belle sélection de produits se retrouvant dans le comptoir alors pour moi c'est un endroit qui mérite bel et bien d'être encouragé! On ne feel pas que les \"goodies\" sont sans gluten alors même pour ceux qui n'ont aucune intolérence (moi!), ça vaut la peine !"}
{"text":"They rely on too much sugar and oil, you can taste the xanthum gum. Gluten free baking 1.0. Rude staff. Over it."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! This place is vegan and gluten free but taste so good that people without food sensitivities
 would love it too. As a lover of sweets I can assure you that this place is worth your time. They're friendly and the treats are DELICIOUS. it's so good I wrote them a thank you email after eating a cupcake hours after buying it. Why are you still reading this? Go. Now."}
{"text":"They use WAY too much sugar.  The desserts were just not enjoyable and they made me sick.  I had an apricot tart and a cookie which produced flatus of epic proportions. Are these people trying to give patrons small intestinal bacterial overgrowth?"}
{"text":"Really great gluten free/vegan bake shop in Kensington Market!

I went with my friend (it was her birthday!) and her 7 year old cousin, and we ordered a double chocolate cupcake and a cinnamon roll. Her cousin LOVED the cupcake, (to be completely fair she loves all cake....) however after trying it myself I can confirm that it was in fact a good cupcake and not just A cupcake. It was really moist which many vegan/GF sweets are not, and not overly sweet surprisingly.  The cinnamon roll was great as well, albeit a bit dry, though it probably would have been better warm so I'd recommend heating it up first. 

We actually came to try their coconut milk soft serve but they were out of the chocolate =/. Overall I think they do a really solid job and I'd be happy to come back on my next trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"For someone with lactose intolerance this place is heaven! I haven't had desserts that good since before I stopped eating dairy 10 years ago."}
{"text":"I went here last week because the delicious scent of those vegan cinnamon buns was wafting in the air outside and I got pulled in. I took it home to share. It's a relatively large size. So paying $4.50 + tax, seems like a fair price. It is tasty, especially considering it's vegan. I'd go back to try one of those muffins, or cookies, but I probably wouldn't get this one again. Something seemed to be missing, I think it was that their wasn't enough moisture. But it was still really good."}
{"text":"Have been here many times.
The supersonic cookie was good-9/10. 
The cinnamon bun was ok-6/10.(the only complaints: the size of the bun is too small and the taste of cinnamon is weak)
Today I tried the pizza muffin. It was big, moist. There was a lot of vegan cheese and basil flakes in it. But! It was way too salty and it's like the baker poured the entire jar of tomato sauce in a single muffin. Have to give it a 2/10."}
{"text":"Great place for vegan, gf treats! When I first discovered this place (I was recco'd by a friend) I went a little nuts and bought almost everything in the store. My all time favs are the cinnamon buns and the cakes for sure. I will be ordering my birthday cake from here no doubt! There are also options for sugar-free as well (I attended a kids bday with a bunners cake) also very tasty. Definitely would recommend this place for anyone who likes baked treats!"}
{"text":"Really cool to find a place that is entirely vegan and gluten-free. The red velvet and cappuccino cupcakes are to die for. Honourable mention goes to the tahini maple cookie. I tried the strawberry cardamom cupcake on my most recent visit and didn't enjoy it. Next time I will stick with my old faves if they are available."}
{"text":"My favourite gluten free bakery hands down. Such great variety of baked goods, and I've tried almost everything they have to offer. 

I regularly buy the seeded bread and my fave are the apricot squares, although today I had the new peach brown sugar square and it's delectable! I have yet to try the soft serve coconut ice cream, but I will soon."}
{"text":"For being gluten free and vegan, I was almost fooled. Yes there's lots of sugar, but baked goods are dessert after all. It's a sinful treat for sure. 

From a price perspective, I think this place is very reasonable. Perhaps a 10-15% premium , but prices are very similar to independent bakeries, and lower than what other vegan/gluten free bakeries charge. 

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"All night after my experience here I explained to my fiancé what gluten free meant, I seriously hope he gets it now.

My Friend decided to take me down to Toronto for pedestrian Sunday , and she also advised me of Bunner's Bake shop. Now I am not allergic to gluten, nor am I vegan, but let me just say to those who are sceptical like I was, don't miss out! 

I order a brownie, butter tart and a blueberry pie, all of which I finished in one sitting, I just couldn't resist (this is why I had to explain to my fiancé what gluten free meant, because I had to explain why I ate all three treats in one sitting, which probably still wasn't a good choice, but I could not help myself). I started with the brownie, and that soft, chewy, chocolately goodness, and I stopped after two bites because I always save the best for last. speaking of two bites, that's what this brownie reminded me of, it was like a hybrid two bite brownie, triple in size, and with chocolate chunks.

I then moved on to the blueberry pie, which was still good to eat, I just wished there was more filling. I ate the butter tart next, and the flavour was there so good and I would definitely be ordering more of it, just the texture of the tart threw me off. I eat butter tarts on a regular basis, so that butter tart here was still great, just a through off in my brain. Then finally I finished that brownie. 

overall, great place, great treats = happy me and happy tummy"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's gluten free/vegan! I was very skeptical when I heard about this place as I'm not usually into the GF/Vegan stuff but wow! Who knew vegans were having this much fun! It's not cheap but worth it and I'll totally pay for high quality baked goods. Already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 6\" 3 Layer Funfetti cake, and it was delicious! The cake is moist, flavourful, and sweet! However, the icing was a little bit too sweet for me. 

Maybe next time i'll ask for the cake to only have icing between the layers opposed to both the layers and outside. Looking forward to ordering the Maple Carrot Coconut cake next, as the cupcake version is delicious and the perfect gluten free blend!"}
{"text":"Cashiers at Bunners : If you are the one opening the shop, please know how to turn the soft serve machine on. Know where the proper ice cream cups are to serve it in. When someone comes in 30 mins after you have opened and wants soft serve, don't feign ignorance and say \"that we just opened\". LAME!

Don't randomly take a phone call while you walk out the shop door and up the street w/o explaining to the customer you are supposed to be serving what you are doing. Don't work in front facing customer service if you became defensive reading this.

You guys are VERY lucky that you products speak for themselves. Your cashiers are useless."}
{"text":"If there is a heaven for people with celiac I imagine it will include a Bunner's with access to unlimited cinnamon buns.

 If you have not been here before don't wait!"}
{"text":"After trying Almond GF and Vegan Bakery near Yorkville, I was really curious to try other GF bakeries.  I never knew how good GF could and wanted to try more.  I arrived to Bunners late on Sunday and was still quite happy they had a large selection available.  It's take out only but the prompt service made through the line quickly.

In the cases, we saw a variety of homey looking bars, brownies, cupcakes, and tarts.  They also cookies and cinnamon rolls on top... seeing how EVERYONE was ordering the cinnamon rolls, it clearly was their big winner.  We ended up getting a butter tart to try out... I was eager to see if they can replicate the buttery flakey dough.  Just under $4, this is a small tart and quite pricey but it does use different ingredients from the normal commercial gluten ones.

The tart was pretty good actually... not too sweet, nice gooey interior... though warning, it has raisins!  The dough was more shortbread like but it was a fairly good rendition.  I would definitely come back to try other things ... perhaps not the buttertart but maybe the brownie!  Comparing this to Almond's Bakery... I'd put Almond over Bunners but Bunners is still a very good option!"}
{"text":"Super delicious gluten free and vegan friendly bakery. It comes at a high cost though!!! $$$$"}
{"text":"the cinnamon bun is the best vegan/gluten free thing i have ever eaten. i was hopeful for the bread and bought a loaf even though the girl at the counter was less than friendly when i asked if they had a bread slicer/machine to slice them. it was typical/awful gluten free bread. and so expensive. i've been trying different ones for years-and hate them all-so it's not just Bunners. I definitely want to return to try more delicious goodies. (and i know they advertise that everything is vegan/gluten free but i can get quite ill if i'm not careful about some ingredients, and their products are not cheap, so i asked....and i know they probably are sick of being ask 1000 times a day but her tone/answer: \"it's ALL vegan/gluten free\" was kinda snarky. I was NOT in the neighborhood really. I went out of my way to go there to try their treats. i'll probably go back sometime for sweets but was wishing it would be my go to place to get bread every week. Food intolerances are not very fun :-( I'm thankful there was places like this."}
{"text":"Amazing baked goods!!!!! Love the set up and seating arrangement at this place. Great prices on baked goods, although drinks are a little bit pricey. Lovely warm vegan atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"hands down the best gf vegan baked goods out there.

I've tried many and there are always some good items but some total letdowns but at bunners everything is 5 star quality.

My favourites: carrot cake cupcake (cream cheese icing to die for), red velvet cupcake, butter tart, date square, meat pie, and of course the soft serve :)"}
{"text":"Four stars because Bunner's has hold of my heart.

You truly can't beat Bunner's for vegan goodies. I've always had excellent experiences at the Junction location, and decided to finally check out the Kensington spot. It's much bigger than the Junction location, and the display for all the baked goods is also a great deal bigger. Yay!

I stopped by for a muffin, and enjoyed the pumpkin chocolate chip. However, I was a little shocked by the attitude of the cashier. I asked her which muffin she prefers (I usually ask these sort of things at the Junction spot and receive friendly and helpful responses), but this woman, obviously annoyed and exhausted, replied with a \"I don't know...everyone has different tastes.\" Ouch! 

Bunner's has something for everyone. Even if you don't have a crazy sweet tooth (and if you don't, I envy you greatly), there are amazing savoury pockets for $5 which are really filling! Will be back here (probably more times than is healthy) because of its proximity to campus and fresh, hearty goodies."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Great vegan cinnabons and cookies.  Prices are steep because of the niche segment they're in, but the treats tasted great!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. A friend and i recently went and enjoyed a blueberry muffin, which had a surprisingly fresh blueberry flavor, and both the the regular and strawberry sticky buns. Both were fantastic but I preferred the strawberry."}
{"text":"There are a lot of guilty pleasures hidden in the Kensington market. 

Bunner's mastered the delicate balance between the \"good\" and the \"evil\". The new Bunner's location in Kensington Market is just as delicious as its original location in the Junction. Bunner's serves up some mean vegan gluten-free nearly guilt-free treats at an affordable price! The Supersonic cookie is out of this world. It is packed with organic protein-rich seeds, oats, cranberries and rich dark chocolate! For $2, this meal-on-the-go-cookie is hard to resist! This location also sells soft-serve vegan soy-based ice cream with a vegan cone for $3!

If you are skeptical about vegan gluten-free treats, test your assumptions at Bunner's with their delicious cup cakes, muffins or cinnamon buns! You may be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I believes Bunner's is a 3.5 more than 4 stars. M surprised me with a Bunner's visit because it's vegan(and gluten free). Everything visually looked so appealing I wanted one of each. We ended up with a large cinnamon bun, a Carmelita square (my favourite), a coconut carrot cupcake and a red velvet cupcake. Honestly the cinnamon bun was so disappointing. It was so dry, that after one single bite I needed a glass of water. I had to space out eating two desserts. I also found it a bit pricey for what it was. I feel like Bunner's makes up for being gluten free and vegan by just dumping loads and loads of sugar on their desserts. 
Would I come back? I highly doubt it. Especially when comic treats is across the road and they have an amazing cookie/brownie combo"}
{"text":"My favourites are the cheesecake (both vanilla and chocolate are great), plus the date squares. I gotta try one of their cookie sandwiches one day. Didn't care much for the raspberry crumble (dry & bland with not much fruit, IMHO)."}
