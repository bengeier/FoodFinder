{"text":"This place is awesome.  The owners had another restaurant in Broadview Heights where we live and we loved that one as well.  When they sold that place we followed them to Scoundrels and it's great.  We go pretty much every Monday night for burger night, they are terrific.  Lots of good beers on tap and the service is great.  We want to go to Bike Night during the summer.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER. My boyfriend.friend and myself decide it would be enjoyable to go out for karaoke and some pool we call here and there and this place. Unknown guy picks up phone and says yes they have pool and karaoke and it starts around 10. Best to get there around 9 930 he says to me. So we get there about 10 30 . To the left they were having some kind of . \"Party\" children and parents and gift baskets. So we walk over to the left in which we see and open area for pool. We get closer and realize that the table is against the wall. So we go over to the bar and order drinks and then inquire about the table. We notice the karaoke dj was setting up a small area next to the open area. Still plenty of room for other activities. So the bartender man comes back and says ooh no pool because of the foundraiser. While we have been in the establishment for some time the people were slowly disipating, especially the ones with children. So I was a little irritated that they would tell me that this place had certain amenities and not mention you are having a foundraiser going on and that the normally amenities would not be available. So as time passes it's about 11 1130 and karaoke is just starting and people still slowly leaving so I ask again about the pool still no and service by the man bartender made us feel unwanted and like he had something much more important to do like walk around with scissors in his back pocket. Ha. So my friend sings his songs and like 4 people. Then he goes up for another. The dj says he is going on break. After about 10 mins of karaoke .the guy comes back and it seems the karaoke was over or they didn't want my friend singing again.which his next song was going to be smashing pumpkins. So as I was about to cash out and sign my tab I just wanted to take the manager on a professional level and discuss the poor service mind you I had 2 drinks the whole night. So he comes out I take him to the side for a quiet more appropriate approach. I told him why i was taking him aside that hes the manager im a paying customer and i just wanted to tell him about my poor service and how we were treated. Then I proceeded to tell the story . I called up here for pool and karaoke and they said yes and didn't mention that there was a foundraiser.... and he cuts me off and says well he wouldn't mention that! I asked why I didn't get a straight answer. He was very hostile and rude for being a manager he couldn't handle this situation professinally. He asked if you want the table moved we'll move it . I said no the isn't the issue any more I just want you to know as a paying customer how I feel and that I was treated poorly. He proceeded to walk away from me. He I guess was going to move the table I said hey don't walk away I didn't even finish and he inquired about the table again and I say no. He walks over to my boyfriend and friend and complains about me tells bar to cut me off lolz. My tab was petty. And proceeds to move the table. I signed my tab no tip and left. The manager is seriously rude and completely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Service is always good.  We go on Wednesday's for the street style tacos. They are the best.  Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Favorite new place in Berea. Food and service is awesome. I was skeptical at first because I'm such a picky eater and wasn't sure if they offered something I would like. My friend ordered the pizza and some chicken fingers. He raved about the pizza. The garlic sauce for the wings was amazing. I ordered a chicken wrap with a side salad which was so delicious.  The chef Charles is great and really puts a lot of attention in preparing the food. A must go to place."}
{"text":"I have been on a search for pizza in the Cleveland area for a long long time. Finally found an excellent one!! Friendly staff, wonderful food , plenty of parking, able to talk to the person I was with and could hear them,  without shouting. Good music. What a refreshing experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. We had the fried green beans for an appetizer and the bbq chicken pizza for entree- DELICIOUS! The owner was on site and very personable. We will be making this a regular visit!"}
{"text":"WOW, I read some of these complaints and wondered what is wrong with these people.  My wife and I have gone there for a few years now and have not had any of the experiences they had.  On the food complaint: They have some of the best food I have ever had in a bar. Anyone who complains about the food either a.) didn't have any,  b.) was expecting  5 star food in a bar, or c.) just is a chronic complainer, which I am siding with. If you search the other comments by some of these folks you will see this issue. I have NEVER had a bad meal here. Somethings I will not order again just because they are not to my liking but they were not bad food.  Their wings are good, not the best I have had but they are wings. Their pizza is amazing, made in a brick oven. And their entrees are amazing. My favorite is the pork chop, or the Sea Bass.   The Manager complaint:  yes this bar does a lot of fund raisers and that helps keep them in business. We have walked in many times and never had bad service or a bad experience. As far as them telling you on the phone they have a fundraiser, who are you the Queen of Sheba? They have a business to run and do a very good job at it.  I have yet to see the manager be rude to anyone unless they deserved it. Sounds like the best thing for you is to go somewhere else and drink and complain there.  To the ladies who saw the men and walked out:  I completely understand your complaint. I have shown up and seen some unsavory groups and went somewhere else, no problem. There are nights where motorcycle groups come in for bike night and I don't feel comfortable. I would suggest you try it on another night, because I think you might be surprised.   We love this place, the food is great, the drinks are excellent, the beer is cold, and if you get Tera as a server, treat her right because she is a peach.  Also, try them on a Sunday for brunch 11 am.  the best breakfast you can ever get for $5.00. We are there almost every Sunday."}
{"text":"I've lived in Berea my whole life. I'm very familiar with Scoundrels. When I heard they got a brick oven and a \"chef\" I thought I would revisit. Let me tell you that they may have a brick oven but they don't know how to use it. The pizza looks nice but it it's over sauced and the cheese is gross and not carmelized. I thought I would give the place a second chance and brought my family for dinner. Boy was I embarrassed! The prime rib steaks were lousy 1/2 inch thick. My brother said the ribs were awful. And everything was overpriced.  I won't be back. This \"chef\" hasn't earned that title yet. He needs a lot more experience before he can call himself a chef and he aint going to get it on my dime! Don't let them fool you it is still Scoundrels!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place. The menu is amazing. The food is five star rated at a very good price The service is excellent! There is something for everyone there. I recommend Scoundrels for ALL walks of live. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Tell them Jamie and Laura sent you!"}
{"text":"We visited the Grindstone Tap House last night, and I wasn't really all that impressed.  The place itself was Ok, maybe in the summer with the garage doors open it would be nice.  The service was fine, and we only ordered an appetizer, which was good, so I can't comment on the food too much.  The drink prices however, we very high in my opinion.  $7.00 for a tall Blue Moon and $4.50 for a tall Bud lite.  For the atmosphere of this place, I wouldnt expect to pay this much for a beer.  I'm used to $5.50-6.00 for a tall..  I ordered a Summer Shandy, and I dont know what they served me, it tasted slightly lemony, but was NOT a summer shandy, or maybe was last years keg? (and of course was $7.00!).  If we would have ordered food, and with drinks, would have spent quite a lot."}
{"text":"Recently opened spot in the old Scoundrel's space and billed as more of a Gastropub than bar and grill, I brought a group of co-workers for our first visit during lunchtime.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive to the group.  Drink orders were prompt and kept filled throughout the meal.  One of my colleagues and I decided to get two different burgers and split them so we could sample multiple styles / flavors.  We settled on a simple bacon cheeseburger and the Grindstone burger)...one with fries and one with tots.  Burgers were artfully presented, especially the grindstone with its mile-high onion straws (see my picture below).  The basic bacon cheeseburger was just that...nothing fancy but cooked to a perfect medium temp.  The Grindstone however was way better with a tangy BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and a mountain of onion straws.  Great flavor combo!  Their fries were hand cut style but more like shoestring in size (just okay). Their tots on the other hand were pure perfection...not greasy and a crispy crunch when bit into.  Lastly, another colleague ordered a three cheese brick oven pizza and offered me a slice to try.  It was flavorful and tangy with a slightly chewy crust.  Decent prices for the quality of the food, pretty sure we'll be back.  Soon."}
{"text":"Just had the steak salad. Steak was tender in a simple salad.  Service was good.  Our friends had the burgers which were awesome."}
{"text":"We had a great meal after the car show. A suggestion would be to warm up the vinaigrette that comes with the Apple Spinach Salad. I had the smoke Gouda sandwich and it was very yummy. Definitely recommend the hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Honestly. Never leave reviews. This is my very first yelp review and let me tell you I am a FOODIE. I love trying new restaurants and spots. I'm from Akron but was at The IX center yesterday and me and my family just wanted to eat somewhere super close by. Totally unassuming place, wasn't expecting anything more than average pub food. Let me tell you I was beyond shocked. No joke one of the best meals I have had in the Cleveland area. I had a special which I hope to god they decide to make a permanent on the menu. It was short rib with blue cheese hash. I order short ribs anywhere they are on the menu. I've had Gordon Ramsey's recipe by a chef he trained and they rivaled his!!! The desserts were also insanely rich and good. I couldn't believe it. I will be making the drive there constantly to try new items. Maricia our waitress was also outstanding and accommodating. Get yourself here ASAP!"}
{"text":"Tap house? Really? 1 ipa on tap and it's rebal?  With all the ipa and that's the best ya got? Bottle selection is no help either, Sierra Nevada \"pale ale\"...guys need to step it up if you want to be called a tap house. Scoundrels had a better selection. Sorry"}
{"text":"Not your average bar food!! It may look like a generic bar, but the food is far from that - high quality dishes at very reasonable prices. I recommend any of the pizzas, the pot roast, or the BBQ Mac and cheese. All amazing."}
{"text":"Great place for a good time.  The new menu is awesome and the food is outstanding, love what they did with the new patio.  Be sure to try the pizzas and spuds, they are great, can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was great.    Had a bacon cheeseburger that was very juicy and big"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and the staff is very attentive and friendly.  Being from Texas, I was happy they had Yuengling."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean pizza is amazing. Wood fired grill can't go wrong. Large on-tap beer list thats always changing but includes a good variety. I will be back! What else... the burgers are great and wings are top notch. Good space with a patio, pool tables and live bands."}
{"text":"Update.  2nd visit.         I visited a second time with friends.  The service was slightly better but I just don't understand how they do things there.   It seems very disorganized and nobody knows what the other person is doing.  The food is pretty good though.  I'll give them that.   But the guy who took my order at the bar never asked where I was sitting and just walked away.  (I was clearly not sitting at the bar but I did not have waitress service)  Later, I saw him offering my food to another patron who was understandably confused.   He never asked for me by name, (which he had bc he put the purchase on my tab that I had open).  He then asked me if it was my food.  He never mentioned my name, he just randomly offered it to people until he got the right person.  Who does this???  Later I asked another bartender for a draft list.   She handed it to me and left.  She never allowed me to make a purchase.   Then of course, you have to get somebody else's attention which is next to impossible there.      This place is just strange.     It's the example of disorganized inefficiency."}
{"text":"I've been back to the Grindstone Tap House a few times since my original review and I am here to add a few stars because the place has classed up a bit, both in the clientele, the atmosphere and the food. The kitchen oil stench and the leering drunks at the bar have been replaced by a cleaner, open-space atmosphere with a great comfy feel. Now there are plenty of patrons there to eat and not just to drink which eliminates the pick-up bar vibe. In the summer, bike nights are great because you get the evening food special plus live music outside on the patio.  Everything I've had to eat so far has been great. Just keep in mind that this is definitely a sports bar so there is a good chance that you will have to listen to a blaring television instead of some good tunes."}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its cover. It may look like a middle-of-the-road sports bar on the outskirts of Berea, but this place has the heart and soul of a gastropub. Seriously. After this experience (our first, btw) we walked out thinking, \"There's really a bit of a mismatch with the building and the food.\"  We stopped in around 6 or so on a Wednesday. Other Yelpers have been unnecessarily harsh on the appearance of the building, and I get it. We all want everywhere to be perfect and trendy with exposed brick, repurposed barn doors for tables, hardwood floors and old-timey light bulbs. Just get over it. Grindstone is fine. It has a nice, big parking lot, a patio outside with large overhead doors opening into the main building (I wish they didn't allow smoking), and the inside is clean. Sure, it still has the old bones of its previous incarnations - pool table in the back, small stage, mirrored walls, linoleum floors, etc. - but it has potential. Could it use updating? Yeah. Does the dining room need more light? Yes. Should it stop you from coming here? Hell no. Moving on.  We opted for an inside seat. Not many folks were there during our visit, a few souls relaxing at the bar mostly. We were greeted by the smiling bartender as soon as we entered and we chose a booth along the wall. Speaking of the service, our server was simply awesome. She exuded a pleasant energy and genuine love for her job that is a rarity in the service industry. She even told us that she loved the food so much that she had to get a job here. BS? Maybe, but we loved her anyway.  When a place calls themselves a tap house, you've got expectations. To be blunt, they've got some nice selections in their 28 taps, but it could use some work. Like eliminating the 10 ABInbev beers that I'm sure they're holding on to for their old-time clients. I get it, you've got to please your customers, but c'mon, there are plenty of great craft pilsners out there. You're a tap house now, it's time to bring in some more beer geek Easter eggs. That being said, I still managed to find something I hadn't had before - New Holland Hoptronix, a really tasty DIPA - so it wasn't all that bad.  Now for the real reason you need to come here. The food. I'm talking food that would give any restaurant on West 25th a run for its money. The menu is pretty big and loaded with tons of options, most of which I wanted to order, that span the gamut from traditional bar fare like wings, potato skins and onion rings to burgers, sandwiches, salads and pizzas made in a 500F brick oven. Looking for more dinner-like fare? They've got bigger entrees, too.   For our meal we started with the soft pretzel with truffled cheese fondue. Damn was this thing delicious. Where most places opt for the generic nacho cheese type sauce, these guys went all out with a house-made ridiculously delicious it should be on everything cheese sauce. The pretzel was perfect, too, but the cheese. Don't want the pretzel? Order a side of the cheese for your fries or tots.  We shared the apple spinach salad and it was also delicious. Fresh spinach, crumbled blue cheese, candied walnuts, granny smith apples, red onions, bacon vinaigrette. It was crispy, just sweet enough and perfect for two. Not a single complaint here.  For our dinner, my wife went with the chicken Philly sandwich and I had the smokehouse burger. The chicken on the Philly was grilled perfectly, just the right amount of char, and the combo of the caramelized onions and mushrooms, ooey, gooey cheese and schmear of mayo on the soft Italian bread roll was purely sinful. The side of tots was crispy, not greasy and I could have eaten my weight in them.  The burger. Where to begin. It was one of the best I've had in months, maybe even all year. The soft brioche bun, the crispy black pepper bacon and applewood smoked onions, sweet bourbon molasses, and smoked gouda and cheddar? I'm getting the stomach rumbles just remembering it. The chef cooked the meat - a combo of three meats ground in house - a perfect medium. That in and of itself is a huge accomplishment. Basically, it was awesome.  So there you have it. You've got the makings of a real winner here. The chef clearly knows what he's doing, the menu is loaded with items that'll have your salivary glands working overtime, and the service was spot on. Sure, maybe the building and atmosphere could use some updating, and maybe they're still in a bit of a transition, but I am rooting for them and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I had a half rack ribs and sweet potato fries. Only 8.00. This isn't typical bar food. Definitely worth an hour drive."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of buddies for the first time, one of which was in visiting for the holidays. It was my buddies last day in the 216, so he wanted something different. This place hit that note, one of us got the prime rib, which was finished surprisingly, that was a big cut. I got the fish 'n' chips, which was good, the only down fall is, the batter was to think on the fish. Everything was cooked properly but the batter was a little thicker, which made the batter not stick to the fish like it should, otherwise everything including the beer selection was very good."}
{"text":"The food, beer, and service was great. Actually excellent!  The hostess and the waitress were very attentive to our table, our needs.  We recommend, for sure"}
{"text":"I think I have been to Berea twice in my life, and the second occasion was for a special Fat Head's Beer Dinner event at Grindhouse that my friend wanted to go to. Appearance wise, I think this place looks like a used whole-in-the-wall sports bar, you can probably get a couple more years of good use out of it but don't be surprised if the bathroom ceiling collapses on you from water damage while you're on the toilet.   For the special event this is what was on the menu: -Watermelon arugula salad with feta and a balsamic vinaigrette. -Fried calamari, kim chi, and a sesame oriental glaze.  -One butternut squash empanada with crushed bacon, maple syrup and creme fraiche.  -Sliced filet, blue cheese polenta, and charred brussel sprouts with a red wine glaze.  -Banana cheesecake, strawberry coulie, and whipped cream.   Beers: -Sunshine Daydream -Goggle Fogger -Spooky Tooth -Up in Smoke -Bumble Berry  My friend and I really enjoyed the food and think that the chef did an awesome job! Only negatives were that the calamari wasn't that impressive compared to the other dishes, and the portion sizes were a bit small so we did leave a little hungry still. For the beer, it wasn't bad, I'm just not a fan of the beers made with bourbon (spooky tooth & up in smoke) and gave those to my friend. Oh and the dinner came to about $50 a person including tax and tip.   Funny/awkward side note: A guy who I had talked to months before (and who had sent me a VERY risqué video) was there. Like what a small freaking world, the gods have got to be messing with me. So yeah, we sat as far away as possible and I tried to hide behind a group of middle aged women singing Vanilla Ice songs.    In conclusion, I haven't had their regular menu, so I can't comment on that, but I would definitely consider driving out to Berea again for another special food/drink event."}
{"text":"When we walked in the door and they were almost empty my husband was concerned. We sat down in the bar and the bartender was very quick to get to us. We ordered the nachos (which were VERY spicy but soooo worth it) and we both got burgers. Let me explain my husband's burger. (I did post a picture) IT WAS MASSIVE. He said that it was amazing. Perfectly cooked, the bacon was superb, the ranch was not from a bottle and was so wonderful, the french fries were hand cut and everything came out hot. The only downfall was that it smells funny inside  (mostly old smelling, not dirty smelling) and the kitchen took a long time but the food was soooo   worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh Scoundrels.. The hidden gem just around the corner from my house..   It might not look like much.. and when you walk in it might not seem like much.. but MANY a fun night can happen at this place.  They have life music on the weekends (local bands that usually have the parking lot PACKED).   During the week they run a number of different specials/events including; Karoake and Trivia.  The Wednesday night trivia group is the best.  Drinks are only 2 bucks (yes almost everything in the place) and pizza's are 5 bucks for a large cheese (1 dollar per additional topping).    The staff is the bomb! The clientele are much more fun and accepting than the stereotypes of the place would make it seem.  Highly recommend this for fun nights out!"}
{"text":"The Wife is a Cleveland native, so we periodically take the Family Oblication to see The Grandma and family.  At times the only return flight is early in the morning, and it's better to stay at an airport hotel than wake The Girls up at 3:30 am.  We didn't know if our hotel had a restaurant (it did), so we looked around the area for something to eat.  The mexican restaurant in the area apparently closed, and as the building next to it said 'Tap House' in the name, I was curious what liquid may flow from the tap.  When we first walked in, we were a little put upon because it looked more like a bar than a restaurant.  We were about to leave, but a waitress caught up to us and said she had a table outside for us if we'd like.  Sure, we're here.  We ask for the menu and beer list, and are rather blown away by both.  Dozens of beers, complete with the type of beer and ABV (very important to know that).  Lots of different types of American food, almost all of them would be worth trying.  We pick some interesting brews and order burgers for dinner.  These burgers are unbelievably huge, and really good.  Dripping with juice, toppings and very tasty fries, I felt like a damn slug when we left.  The kids loved their ice cream.  I won't sugar coat it, some of the clientele are not exactly from the upper floors of the Key Tower, The Wife was tempted to cover The Daughters' ears more than once.  However, they and the staff were friendly to us, and we had great beers and burgers (which is what I'd hope you'd hope for from a tap house)."}
{"text":"Went to Grindstone Tap house, food was good, draft beer very high at $9 for what I got. Most disturbing when we got our bill their was a .02 \"rounding fee\" & when our credit card was run the bill turned from 25.58(rounded up .02 to 25.60) to 25.80 after the card was run. We went to the bar & the owner or whoever it was said it was an \"honest mistake\" & gave us .20 back.  .20 (actually.22 before rounding) doesn't sound like much, but I'm guessing all those \"honest mistakes\" add up! If you go here better double check your bill! Won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a few different flavors of wings and they all ended up tasting like buffalo sauce only.  We also grabbed a pizza and it was very sweet. In the end we ended up being disappointed with all of our food."}
{"text":"Awesome pub/restaurant.   Really good pub food.  We had a mini sirloin steak- Caesar salad - baked spud for under $10.   Great music.  Great for dancing but you can still hold an easy conversation.  We really liked our first visit and will be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this hidden gem when looking for a restaurant close to the airport to grab a quick bite. Wow. If you are a carnivore, do yourself a favor and get a burger from this place! The meat is a great quality, the patty is massive, they have all sorts of creative toppings (I had goat cheese and onion strings), they cook it to the true temperature you ask for (no over-cooking here), and they are accompanied by piping hot, perfectly crispy fries. Also, a shout out to the stellar service we got from Lauren. She made us feel welcome even though we came in when they were absolutely empty during the down time between lunch and happy hour. Cheers to that!"}
{"text":"Seriously crappy service. Came here with the intention of having dinner. Bar maid didn't mention the 2 taps that were out when i asked for the beer list... guess which 2 i asked for! Then wandered off for a while. Drank my (overpriced) beer & left."}
{"text":"This is very much a corner bar in its clientele and atmosphere. So don't be surprised if you get a loud voice (but friendly) booming across the bar. But the food is far from the average burger and fries. This place has some good specials and some unique food selections. They have a delicious Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich with a tangy sauce, goat cheese and caramelized onions. It's served on a toasted brioche bun. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. They also offer a Pulled Pork Mac-N-Cheese fondue that is rich and creamy and topped with toasted bread crumbs all baked in the oven. The portion size feeds two easily. It's $10.00 and worth every penny. The servers are friendly and efficient. We have just started to eat our way through the menu, enjoying each and every bite. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A buddy and myself have been doing this place for lunch for the last three months or so.  We have still not gotten through all the menu items.  We keep getting interrupted by daily specials that are always very good!  Yesterday it was Brisket on a flat bread with a mango sauce, onions and tomatoes.  Yummy!  Oh and the servers that I have met so far, Lauren, Dee and Stephanie are all very bright and gave us great service.  They go out of their way to do so. The owner has also came out of the kitchen to make sure we have enjoyed our meals.  How often do you see that at the average place?  On thursday the lunch special was Surf and Turf for $10.00.  Crab Stuffed Shrimp, strip steak with steamed Asparagus and a Chipotle sauce.  Sooo good we called out the chef, Chad, and thanked him!"}
{"text":"I have lived near Scoundrels for a long time and the place was never anything to write home about. However, they have really done well with these most recent changes.  Lots of unusual things on the menu.  Not your typical bar food but more kicked up a few notches.  My friend and I sampled several things on the menu - the chicken nachos, plain jane burger and I can't even remember what else we had but it was all really good.  There really is something for most everyone on the menu.  Haven't tried the pizza that they brought in the brick oven for but I'm sure I will soon.  The staff was very friendly and courteous.  they didn't care that we took a long time to order (we talked more than we studied the menu!)  There were people of all adult ages there and I really didn't get the \"meat market\" feel from the place.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This was our second time at grindstone tap house.. The first time we had some onion rings and potato skins.. Omg both were delicious they came with amazing sauce on the side! the onion ring dip was just so tasty I ordered another dip! The same for the potatoes skins! And trust me I've tried a lot of both in bars and restaurants I most say the best I had in a long time! The second time there we had the same but also the chicken and waffles and I had the roast beef... Chicken and waffles are really yummy to and you get a good size for your money! The roast beef was ok I enjoyed it but only thing would be is it needs gravy! Lol but still I would order it again... The service was great both times.. they waited to we where ready and stayed on top of everything! I definitely love this place already and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Food...excellent. I am so happy to have discovered a place in the area that has such a delicious modern brunch menu. Before today, my husband and I had always had a difficult time deciding on where to spend our Sunday Fundays. We always had to drive to Lakewood or Rocky River or Cleveland for a quality brunch....but no longer. We can now drive 5 minutes to Grindstone!  I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was served 5 generously sized pieces of fried chicken tenderloins on a stick.  The breading was crunchy and did not overwhelm the chicken. They lay atop 3 golden waffles.  The meal came with a sriracha sauce that had nice heat, but a hint of sweet. I asked for a side a syrup- to satisfy my sweet tooth. I mostly enjoyed combing the waffle, chicken, sriracha, and syrup to make one flavorably complete bite.  My husband ordered the porkbelly Benedict. My favorite part of that meal was the honey mustard bbq hollandaise sauce.  We started with a bloody Mary and it was one of the better ones I have had in a while. But I really recommend the mango mimosas. Fresh mango pieces and a little mango vodka added.  The best part about this brunch is that it's not just on Sundays! They have brunch on Saturdays too! Can't wait to go back and try another delicious dish!"}
{"text":"Just went to Grindstone on Monday night. The place doesn't look super appealing from the outside and is an interesting location. Once we got inside, the decor was fine. The service was also great. Our server couldn't have been more attentive to us. A few of the women at my table ordered hot tea and our server must have refilled their water 3 times at least.  Monday nights are also burger/chicken sandwich nights and they were only $6. There was a small up charge with certain side items.  I was feeling slightly under the weather so I only ordered a baked potato. It was pretty good. It has cracked salt and pepper on the outside.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The former Scoundrels Bar and Grill has upgraded in my opinion. I don't ever remember the former having such a diverse and tasty menu but The Grindstone Tap House has just that. You really can't go wrong with anything if you're looking for excellent gastropub fare. This place has always been a great spot to watch a game but I'm impressed with what they've done with the outdoor patio area. For as long as I've come to this place I can't ever remember them utilizing that spot as well as they are now. It's wonderful to sit out there on a nice night and watch the game. I definitely recommend checking The Grindstone Tap House out!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Friendly staff!   I was there for the first time a couple nights ago to see one of my favorite bands. We got there plenty early to get a table and eat before the band took the stage. There were about 5 servers on hand, ready for a big crowd later, but the odd part is that none of them seemed to have a dedicated section. We'd order a drink and no sooner would our server walk away when a different girl would come up to see if we wanted another drink. Nothing wrong with that though, right?  Too much service is a good thing!  Well...it can backfire...and I'll get to that later! The menu looked fantastic!  Not your typical bar food fare!  While I wanted to try one of EVERYTHING, my husband and I opted to split the Apple Spinach-Chorizo Flat Bread and the Smoked Gouda Grilled Cheese. The Flat Bread came out first. Wow!  A crispy Flat Bread topped with not-too-spicy chorizo, spinach, mozzarella, provolone & goat cheese, Granny Smith apples....drizzled with a maple glaze. The tanginess of the goat cheese blended perfectly with the sweet crunchy apples and the kick of the chorizo!  And the maple glaze just brought it all together! The Smoked Gouda Grilled Cheese?!?!  Holy yumminess!!!  Joining the smoked Gouda between the sourdough bread were bacon and Granny Smith apples!  On the side was strawberry jam for dipping. Again, the salty, smoky bacon paired perfectly with the sweet apples and jam!  The house made chips were fantastic as well!  Fresh and crispy!   The place filled up quickly as show time approached. Not everyone had a table, some were standing, mainly by the bar area. And this is where the the service overkill went completely south. I was in need of another beverage and there were NO servers on the floor. After about 15 minutes of not seeing anyone, I noticed they were ALL behind the bar, filling orders of the guests gathered around the bar!  What the?!??  Why are there 6 bartenders while nobody's taking care of the tables? Those in the dining area were just out of luck!  Most of the other guests had the same reaction as I did.  You could see everyone looking around for a server with their empty glasses in front of them. When one of the servers finally emerged, she went straight for a group of guys standing around and took their drink order!  Really? They're standing 10 feet from the bar!  They can walk over and order for themselves!  Take care of your tables!  After too long of a wait, we finally got one of the girls' attention and received another beverage. This hiccup was the ONLY thing that knocked this review from 5 stars to 4. And while I probably sounded really harsh just now, it wasn't a HUGE deal and I'm thinking that on a night where they don't have a big event it wouldn't be that way. I would just think that having dedicated sections would've avoided this issue.  As far as the entertainment....The sound was great for both bands. Good lighting too!  No complaints at all in that department!   Overall my first experience at Scoundrel's was a great one!  I will definitely be back to work my way around that awesome menu!!!"}
