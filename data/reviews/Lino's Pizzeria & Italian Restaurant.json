{"text":"I try different Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. I received a flyer on my door & it turns out as I went to sign my son up for taekwondo classes, they were around the corner. Love the food! Exactly how I like it! The hostess taking my order was very nice, as well! That's hard to find these days! 
Kind employees?! Nice place! Think I'll
make this my families new Italian restaurant to frequent!"}
{"text":"The food is better then most pizza places in town. The staff is really welcoming. I had a great first experience. I highly recommend it for a pizza adventure."}
{"text":"Well the delivery was very fast. The delivery  man was about 15 minutes early. He was very nice and professional. However I had asked 2 slices of pizza to be plain cheese with the rest of the pizza to have the 2 toppings and they did not get that right I am afraid. Overall, the pizza did not taste great so I will not use their services in the future."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to receive my order but not before mixing my order up and asking someone other than myself to use my card for their order. Forgot my soda also. Fries were overdone, i do believe they were old and refried. They did bring my soda which magically turned into a flat watered down dr pepper...
The wings were ok I must say but Def my last time ordering

 Never again"}
{"text":"We stopped here looking for lunch on our way into the Las Vegas strip. Had a fabulous lunch for a total of about $24. My husband's lasagna was first rate and my pasta it was delicious too. The minestrone soup was fabulous. Wonderful food at a great price."}
{"text":"Ordered Italian pizza and lino's calzone. The delivery was surprisingly fast and the pizza was hot and yummy. Reasonable price for pizza. Gonna order more from these guys."}
{"text":"I always get delivery  and the food is always hot and of course  delicious love the prices  also this is definitely  my favorite  place to eat when I don't to go out and my children  love it too. Linos  is excellent  five star rating from me."}
{"text":"Food is always hot, fresh and delicious! Drivers are also always friendly and courteous. Great restaurant and food!"}
{"text":"Cute, small restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Food was pretty decent, although my Carbonara tasted a bit like Alfredo sauce.  I'll definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The best resteraunt in town! Awesome service and people! Great food! Would recommend it to everyone I know!  Love linos to death!"}
{"text":"This is the first time in 6 years that Lino's messed up! First my burger buns were rock hard & they looked at my husband like he was stupid when he asked for different ones. Opened up my chicken finger box my food looked bomb! Once I took a bite it tasted like burnt rubber. At this point I lost my appetite and wanted my money back. The cashier Christina gonna say the manager said we don't do refunds. Can I speak to your manager ? Oh he's not here I called him on the phone.... she got back on the phone to tell me they can only remake my food and bring the other food back. She said we make our food the same if we cook it any time less it's gonna be raw. Ma'am I just want my money back so I can go. Or can I have a credit for next time I purchase? No we can't do that. Okay that's fine. A man gets on the phone says we will refund your money just bring the food back. Now I gotta drive allllllllll the way back over to there to get my refund. I walk in and the girl acts like she doesn't know why I'm there. I need my refund on the food. She looks back at the guy standing in the back and says she's here for her refund. I ask her can I speak with her manager is he here ? She looks back again like she doesn't know who her manager is or if he's here. I didn't have the same card I purchased with because it was my husbands so I told her I can come back tomorrow and get the refund. A man walks up his name is SAM I'm guessing he's the manager and he's been there the whole time the girl was lying to me on the phone saying she had to call him to get an answer. She tells me she gonna refund me $9 . I tell her with tax she goes I'm giving you back what you paid for the chicken fingers. Well I paid tax on my chicken fingers so give i want the whole amount. The manager was no help he was there for \"moral support\" I WONT EAT HERE NO MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE & COOK is TRASH"}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza spots....the service is great, it's so clean and cozy inside and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Check your bags before you leave, they like to forget things. They also charge extra to use your own credit or debit card. Foods not very good, took better part of an hour to get my order - even though I phoned it in. I tried it, Im done and wont go back."}
{"text":"Small but cute. Most come to take their Pizza away but they also have some few tables. Very kind waitress! The coke wasn't that good but the Pizza, Ribs and Spaghetti have been very well.


Muy bien! Pequeño pero también unos mesas. Te recomiendo Pizza, Ribs y Spaghetti. La gente son muy amable."}
{"text":"Best pizza and pasta in town! I love the different kinds of pizza, my favorite being the spinach and the barbecue chicken. Their menu offers such a variety of options! I like to try them all and I have never been disappointed. Their shrimp scampi is the best! And their stuffed shells too! Can't go wrong with linos, their prices and quality of food never lets me down. I'll always be back for more! Thank you linos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food! Pizza is delicious! You can't go wrong with their pick up special--$6.99 for a large cheese pizza. I have ordered multiple times and will continue to do so. The staff is always friendly and super helpful! I love Lino's!"}
{"text":"Wtf driver refused to give me my 2 liter of soda when it was clearly on my receipt his excuse was oh sorry we are closed i forgot it and also didn't put any cheese on my CHEESE burger"}
{"text":"I ended up waiting an hour and a half for food my delivery took forever but when I got here I was very pleased"}
{"text":"I ordered calamari and wings. The wings were great but the calamari was fried into little crunchy bricks. Way, way over cooked. Or, I suspect, cooked twice to reheat leftovers, because they were not burnt."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheese calzone I have ever had!  Small was actually a single (plus dogs) serving.  Cheeses were blended with just a touch of sauce.  Dough was light and flaky. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place I have ever ate at. Absolutely amazing customer service and the staff if so cool. Had a great experience and really good food. Vanessa is a great server to!"}
{"text":"Just placed order for delivery from lino's Italian restaurant,  delivery takes about 45 minutes as promised.  I received hot fresh pizza, crust was good, cheese was melting in my mouth. I can't wait for my wife to not cook  so I could order from them again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very delicious food. We ordered 2 large pies, spaghetti with meat sauce, garlic bread, a philly cheese steak sandwich and also got a complimentary order of garlic knots. Wooo hooo. There are six of us and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow. This food is so good that my kids are speechless at the table. They are not stingy with the portions. We will definitely be back to dine in and they have delivery."}
{"text":"My husband and I had food delivered from Linos last weekend. We both got very sick and missed 2 days of work. Never ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Omg. The linos calzone was amazing. Had all the cheese I could eat. I asked for well dobe and it came out perfect. Took a little longer but it was worth it. They had a in house ranch that was one of the best i had in a long time. My wife had a shrimp linguine with pink sauce that was also another treat. The service here was very friendly and the atmosphere felt like I was in a little restaurant in Italy with the portrait on the wall. In other words it's a hole in the walk but the service was good and the food was even better. Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place for local new York style pizza. It's a small joint, but it's clean and the staff is friendly. Pizza is always delicious, I like mine well done, which they always do well. You wouldn't think it would be that difficult, but it seems to be for many places. Wings are fresh and delicious. They're made properly, not reheated from out of some bag. Fries are good, portions are a little small though sometimes. Antipasto is flavorful and let pretty satisfying.  Definitely worth a drop in if you're looking for some good chow.  I gave four stars because delivery is almost always super slow."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be going back for seconds! Dined in and our waitress (sorry didn't catch her name) and Mark took great care of us!  I ordered the meatball sub and my significant other had the Lino's Calzone.  The bread on the sub was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the meatballs and sauce were excellent! My boyfriend said his calzone was one of the best he's had in years!  We'll be trying the pizza next!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bummed that they moved locations as they're now further away from us, but that doesn't change the fact that their food is great. 
We love their antipasto salad and meatball pizza. 
At the time of writing this they have a great special every Tuesdays on their lasagna. We make a point to try and go every Tuesdays. Definitely recommend trying it if you can!"}
{"text":"Very very good Pizza my family and I have been here twice and we love the pizza and wings not to mention it's clean and they have one man taking orders he's very cool and sweet we are a party of 6 and have to young little monsters that can bug at times and never has he been rude or looked bothered by the noise"}
{"text":"Customer service is great they are all really nice but food is far from authentic. Not awful though some things on the menu are ok like the pizza is OK but like I said nowhere near authentic"}
{"text":"Linos is always a great place to stop and eat. Last time we visited Linos I ordered chicken fettuccini and my fiancee got their lasagna. It was great. She said the lasagna was the best she tried. Portions are good for price, enough to satisfy a big guy like me. We finished with cannoli and tiramisu. After remodeling the restaurant looks very cozy . The server Christina was very nice and professional . definitely gonna be here often ."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. It quick and delicious Italian food. Very family friendly. And the service is always top notch!  The nicest people and great food!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  We had the seafood pasta, a calzone and the garlic knots.  The food was really good and fresh.  The server was very attentive even though he was the only one on duty.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Passed by the place many, many times and finally decided to give it a try. The pizza? Ehh. Even though I requested to cook it longer for a stiffer crust, instead, I got a soggy crust and pools of grease on top. The cheese kept sliding off. Ingredients (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom) were fine. The caesar salad consisted of iceberg lettuce instead of romaine and the croutons were smaller than dice. Delivery was fast and driver was friendly though."}
{"text":"Just had the Lino  special pizza, awesome. Thin crust and not soggy, just the way we like it, crisp and crunchy.  Will be back. Also the minestrone soup was very good."}
{"text":"I used to go to Rocco's Pizza on Charleston because they were the only shop in town that I thought had true New York Pizza. Verrazano came close but now after finding this place I'll probably come here next time especially when I'm on this side of town. Pizza was excellent the service was great got our free garlic knots with a check in from Yelp. My wife and son went back the next day got a meat lovers that's how much we've enjoyed their pizza.

I'll probably order one of their dinners over Pizza next time as they have some good items on their menu."}
{"text":"Hard to find authentic NY Style pizza in Las Vegas area and Lino's is one of my go to places for REAL Pizza! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizzeria in town. My husband is from New York and prefers New York style pizza 

They deliver extremely fast! Ordered a cheese pie tonight and it was at my home hot and ready in 24 mins!! Awesome! Plus the delivery driver is always friendly with a smile on his face. Double awesome!"}
{"text":"I found them on google, I'm glad I did, they delivered my pizza with in a half hour. I haven't had good pizza like this in the 5 years I've lived in Vegas, glad I found this place."}
{"text":"What can I say. Fast delivery. Traditional Italian pizza. Always fresh and yammy!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always great. We usually order the 2 slice special and chef salads. The pizzas are always hot and the salads fresh when we get them. Patrick always make me laugh when I call in my order and it's always a good experience. I would have added pictures except everybody was already digging in before I had a chance."}
{"text":"Wow a good pizzeria restaurant right down the street from where I live. YES! And the people who work there are very welcoming. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great spot to enjoy some good pizza. Not greasy like other pizza locations. The garlic knots were so darn good and the staff was very friendly. The medium size pizza is plenty for 2 people we still had leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. I loved the seafood pasta...a very large portion of seafood (shrimp, scallops, and mussels). I'd highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place cause I was craving Italian.  I ordered my usual which is eggplant Parmesan.  It was $12 and I was so disappointed when i took a look at it.  The dinner came with spaghetti which took up more than half the plate.  My eggplant Parmesan was so minuscule!  The spaghetti itself was bland and mediocre.  Wish I got Chinese delivered instead."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.  They have a great lunch special 2 slices and a soda for 4.95 (topping 50 cents extra).  Pizza was ok.  Definitely not the best pizza in Vegas but for a 4.95 lunch special it was ok."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant!!! Why you might ask? Well, if you have 15 minutes I will give you the run down on Leno's food, employee's and over all cleaniness of  the restaurant....I Have been coming to Leno's for the past 9 years and I have NEVER been displeased with the service or food...
Leno's has that small town hospitality that you'd be shocked to find in such a big city. The staff treats you like family from the moment you walk through the doors. They always greet you with smiles on their faces and an amazing attitude that makes you feel right at home. Just like the staff, the dining itself makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. From the portion size and taste, to the price and quickness of the preparation, Linos is definitely an amusement park for your tastebuds. I encourage anyone who reads this to give Linos a try. After the first bite, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"My family and I recently tried this place, the whole experience was amazing! Our server Christina was outstanding, great customer service and very helpful. You can taste how fresh the pizza is. The pasta was even better.  My whole family enjoyed we will definitely be making this a regular."}
{"text":"Good pizza next to Joes Pizza near the strip who is the best out in Vegas in my opinion. Awesome pick up special $6.99 for a large pie yes! I've eaten here many times and it doesn't disappoint. Very affordable and delicious


Update 

Took away one star. My husband and I frequent this establishment for quite sometime. Today we ordered the pick up special, my daughter really wanted to dine  in so we decided to do so. Upon paying the young woman taking our payment mentioned that the 6.99 pick up special was only good of we weren't dining in. Pick up is a very broad statement, since in all actuality I am picking up my pizza so I didn't think it was a big deal if we sat down in the empty restaurant but ok. I paid an additional $5 for the pizza to sit down.  Upon paying I expressed to her how I found the price to be exuberant considering the many times we've ordered in addition my husband has dined in with a pick up  special in the past (not sure if this was an exception made out of courtesy but he has). The young woman replied \"the menu says it as clear as day the the price is only for pick up only\". I understand the concept of a pick up special, to entice folks to pick up versus having a delivery driver go out of their way for delivery. Perhaps a \"dine in\" rate should be added in lieu of the $11. In all actuality we sat down, I asked to have the pizza brought out exactly how it would if we were taking it to go as we would have left overs. The lady brought it out with plates which I refused. I truly was dining in because my child wanted to not because I could not eat a slice in my car also because I wanted to be quick as I had an appointment. Paper plates,  and napkins would have been fine. Anyway, very disappointed on the pick up policy and could completely understand if it were a Friday or weekend or even if the restaurant was packed....there wasn't a soul in the place. Just as regulars I think it was pretty crummy that I was made to feel that way and I understand policy is policy but the policy isnt clear. Just because it's called a pick up special shouldnt mean I need to pick up and get out.  Again perhaps a dine in special would aleviate the frustration for your customers. Will I come back perhaps...but if I want to pay the extra Ill just order delivery and eat the pizza in the comfort of my own home."}
{"text":"Good and consistent. We rely on delivery here at work. The Yelp menu and order on line was punctual."}
{"text":"Pizzas from Lino's ordered a few times--once by delivery, others picked up.  When we tried delivery, we were surprised at how quickly the pie showed up, piping hot!  And, of course, whenever we stop by for pick up, it's right out of the oven, not sitting in a warmer.

We seem to be in a rut with our typical order being a large sausage/pepperoni/mushrooms
/olives pizza, but last time, the visiting little one wanted her own custom-made pepperoni with pineapple (heaven forbid). Can't say how the weirdo pepperoni pineapple was since I refused to try it, but she loved her special creation. Hubby and I usually enjoy the wonderful thin crust (bubbly at the edges) with our saner toppings. Once, it was a bit too juicy, but we figured it was probably because of the fresh mushrooms. Hubby wishes they would do sliced Italian sausage instead of crumbled, but no matter what, there has never been a slice gone to waste in our house."}
{"text":"I've tried many different pizza places trying to find the perfect buffalo chicken pizza close to how I love it from back east and theirs is pretty darn good"}
{"text":"I love this place so much.Great family restaurant and best customer service.I would recommend everybody this place. The chef,the waitress,i believe Jamie, was so attentive.Food is awesome.I'll be back again for sure.I LOVE LINO'S..."}
{"text":"The food that I tried was actually pretty good although a bit on the pricey side.  The fact that the food was okay gets the place a star.. 

Service is horrible. Extremely rude on the phones.. Takes over an hour for delivery even if you live down the street and don't have a large order. 

They FORGOT some of my food, and when I called about it she said that they were \"too busy\" to bring it to me and that I could have a credit. I didn't want a credit, my family was hungry then not some day in the future!
I PAID for food and a delivery fee that they refused to bring me! 

patrons beware!"}
{"text":"I was on this side of town for a doctor's appointment and used the Yelp app to find Lino's and place an order for pickup via Eat24. Time estimate was accurate and staff were friendly and helpful. Location was nicer than expected inside, looks like a cute dinner spot.

Ordered 2 lunch specials- the Greek salad and an Italian sandwich, latter comes with a side, both come with a drink and clock in under $8. Online menu doesn't break down what's on the salad and I was underwhelmed to find no protein on my order (and no option was given to add it, either). Huge portion of lettuce and a few peppers, olives, onions, etc with some cheese. There was also a mixup with the dressing. Sandwich was large and tasty though. Maybe their pizzas and Italian options fare better, no by the slice sales despite the long list of lunch specials."}
{"text":"This place did not meet my expectations at all! This is not authentic Italian food. I didn't try the pizza, but I had the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and penne al vodka. Was horrible! The price was way too expensive for what I got. As I was eating the only thoughts I had were I got taken for $37.75. I will never be back, its not authentic. I could've boiled some noodles and got a jar of alfredo sauce myself!"}
{"text":"It's the most \"New York\" style pizza I've found in Las Vegas so far. Thanks 

They do need to streamline their web ordering. I ordered, drove all the way down, and they hadn't even started my order. They need to make what you can requested."}
{"text":"its pretty good.  had pizza and meatballs and lasagna with a bunch of family.  I would go again.  the pizza was tasty.  wish they had beer or wine though"}
{"text":"Found a new favorite pizza place today near work!! Ordered the small meat lovers pie and a side of meat balls. The pizza was amazingly delicious, and for a meat lovers, it wasn't swimming in grease and the crust was perfect! The meat balls are great as well, and the price for two is super reasonable. service was prompt and friendly, the co-workers and myself will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Order for delivery for. Chicken fingers and salad and drink 23 dollar wow but I wanted to try them it took an hour for delivery and when I received my food no napkins no forks and food was cold and hard I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great little restaurant in the middle of nowhere! Their signature seafood dish is to die for. I asked if the chef could mix marinara and alfredo together, it's something I've been doing since I was a kid. Surprisingly enough they accommodated my culinary fetish and voila I had the dish of my childhood! Very much recommended! Grab a friend, since it's too big a portion for one person. I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"I love that the business is small and family owned! We dined in and the servers were very friendly. I had the ultimate seafood linguini it was fresh and hot. My girlfriend had the coconut shrimp and loved it. We had a wonderful experience. The prices were reasonable and it tasted homemade! If you want an amazing restaurant that is small quiet and intimate definitely go to Linos on Craig and Valley!!!"}
{"text":"So Lino's has been the spot to go for pizza since 2013 for me. The pizza reminds me of NY pizza, and in Vegas it's hard to find some good pizza and calzones, but wow they literally are my fave and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"first time here with friends, I tried italian pizza and wow, the best ever, crust was good and toppings all fresh. I also ordered the fried callamary and it was perfect. I was referred by a friends I am going to recommend this place to all family and friends. small restaurant but nice atmosphere and friendly services. thanks , will be back soon."}
{"text":"This was by far the most delicious delivery food I have ever had. Linguine Imperial was the bomb. Staff was amazingly nice, great experience I'll recommend this to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  This is really as good as it gets!  YUMMERS!"}
{"text":"Usually the food is good, but lastnight I ordered a meatball calzone. There were no onions or peppers just cheese & meatballs plus it was under cooked. The dough was  very under cooked & sticky in the middle. Threw out over 1/3 of of the dough. I called the gal over the phone stated the cook was new and probably just didn't know all the ingredients, also would give me 10% discount on next order. She didn't even let me finish talking and hung up. I think more should have been done than just stating a 10% discount. Definately makes me think twice about going back."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend a year and a half ago and the food was fantastic. Just moved to this area of town and kept telling my bf we needed to go there or order from there. With a recent surgery keeping me home, he decided to pick up take out for us one evening in his way home from work. We ordered a Caesar salad, chicken Parmesan, and shrimp scampi with angel hair instead of linguine. He brought it home and the scampi had linguine. He had a rough day at work and decided to take it back. He walked in and the girl at the counter looked scared but they did remake his dish and offered two slices of tiramisu for the inconvenience.  The food is phenomenal! Chicken parm is right up there with Maggianos in my opinion! Huge portion!!! It comes with a side of spaghetti too. Absolutely great affordable food, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I had use one word to describe Lino's I'd say overpriced. My experiences with Lino's was ordering a Lino special pizza , Chicken parmigiano sub , Chicken picatte , Lino's calzon and two meatballs on side. The dough on the pizza was hard like a rock , the sauce was flavorless but the toppings were seasoned correctly and in good amounts. The sub was typical but really dry. The chicken picatte tasted like spaghetti with water. The calzon was typical but really small for 11$. The Meatballs were the right size and had just the right amount of seasoning on them. Overall their food was mediocre and overpriced. As for the customer service  , it was friendly , they took care of my order with no problems and delivery was about the right time on arrival 40min."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant. The prices, you can't beat for the quality of the food. We always have great service. Very good for the small family feel. You won't see me at Pizza Hut anytime soon!"}
{"text":"We constantly order from here. We have tried many items in the menu and they are all delicious. The carrot cake and chocolate eclair are some if not the best I have ever had! I have shamelessly ordered just dessert from here before. Love that they deliver!"}
{"text":"Great food. The servers are pretty slow refilling drinks and checking if we need anything,  but other than that the  Penne Ola Vodka was amazing! We ordered spaghetti but they mistakenly gave us that instead. Deff recommend."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, I really like it eat it like once a week lol. Good service and always fresh."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza , big tasty chicken wings . Quick delivery and reasonable prices . Thank you"}
{"text":"First time ive had this place was tonight. I got the pastrami and let me tell you, best fucking pastrami that I've ever had since i moved to Vegas. Best spot period. Star is super friendly and very original not fake. I normally don't do this, but I will be writing a good review on my website about this. Straightbetsports.com this place is 5+++++++"}
{"text":"We just ordered and the food came very fast, before scheduled delivery time. The food was still hot when we got it and everything tasted delicious. Bottom of the pizza was clean, which is a good sign of a clean oven."}
{"text":"Best mom and pops neighborhood pizzeria in Vegas a definite place to go yummy food and great staff........."}
{"text":"After being invited here several times by a friend I finally toke him up on his offer.

Ordered a combo pizza and wings and a dinner salad, it was ok.
Service was great, I believe her name was Cori, and she was on top of our refills and kept us happy our whole visit."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time ordering delivery and I'll never order from them again. I waited an hour for delivery, my food was cold, and wrong. I ordered the family special with a pepperoni pizza, half mild fingers half medium fingers, and Sprite and Lemonade. My order arrived cold with no pepperoni and no Sprite. I flagged down the driver who shrugged his shoulders and told me to call the kitchen back. I called and spoke to the same girl who took my order. She said sorry all I can do is either give you a pizza credit or send another pizza out in about 20 minutes. I opted for the credit because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes but I'll never use it...it's not worth the money to end up disappointed. I don't recommend this place at all..."}
{"text":"Lino's has fantastic pizza. They offer a special for pick up pizza. Get a cheese pizza for like $7 or so. Always friendly. Free garlic knots when you check in. Just let them know you want to do it."}
{"text":"A friend of mine said this was great pizza, so I gave it a try tonight.  It's pretty expensive pizza, so you'd expect it to be pretty decent.  Unfortunately, the order came incorrect, and it just wasn't that good. Ingredients were not up to par, crust was really dense, salad was wilted and plain, chicken had no flavor, the whole family was bummed.  If I could go back in time, I would have just ordered papa johns for half the price and called it good.  Maybe it was an off day, who knows, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Love the remodel and love the food. Seriously delicious lasagna that can be delivered to your door. Amazing marinara and meat sauces! 

Pizza has been great the couple times we've ordered."}
{"text":"have ordered from Linos for years now. The food and service is always great I am never disappointed. The seafood is fresh, vegetables are fresh. Some items are a bit pricey but its worth it."}
{"text":"The ordering was quick and easy - the girl on the phone was very nice. We ordered 2 pizza's, italian calzone, fingers and caesar salad. All were very good. Delivery took about 50 minutes but I expected longer due to the Friday before Christmas. It was stll hot and yummy. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Best service in Las Vegas. The pasta was fresh. And my kid loved colieens attitude. Def coming back."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived cold and dripping wet after asking for \"well done\". The pizza here is not even edible, let alone good."}
{"text":"I drive from Henderson for their Chicken Alfredo. SO delicious, best one I've had hands down. They catered my aunt's party years ago, and I've loved it ever since."}
{"text":"It took over an hour and 20 minutes to get food delivered to my house. I love their food but My boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning this time. It was horrible waking up at midnight hugging my toilet all night. I won't be ordering food from there again."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday last night. The food is awesome, quiet, comfortable, family environment, Did I mention great customer service!!! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner based upon the great Yelp reviews but we were sorely disappointed.  The restaurant itself was nice and clean and service was great.  We ordered the shrimp pasta and fettuccine Alfredo and both dishes were bland and uninteresting.  It seemed as if someone cooked a ton of pasta and threw in some shrimp and a little sauce  and nothing else. The best thing was the garlic bread, which was crunchy and flavorful.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong entrees?  Unfortunately, this will not be my go to restaurant while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly workers. We have tried lasagna and it delicious. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I had a meatball sandwich, the bread was on point crunchy, melted cheese and the meatballs were good. My girl had lasagna, and that was good as well. Went home with our bellies happy and full"}
{"text":"This is a good go to place to get delivery or take out. I prefer take out because you never know the journey your order goes on once it leaves the restaurant for delivery. 
 I call ahead and 20-30 minutes later the order is ready. 
I sure LOVE their ranch dressing- and so does everyone else because they charged me almost 3$ for 2 extra cups. 
I wouldn't recommend dining in unless necessary because there isn't much going for the place as far as ambiance. There is a TV to keep you entertained. The kitchen is open which is great, but in such a small location, it can make it pretty noisy for the customers. Pizza is tasty and the toppings are fresh and with a good amount of sauce and cheese. The crust is flaky and not too thick. Give Lino's a try."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzeria's in town. Great lunch specials, friendly and fast service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere best pizza and wings I ate in North Las Vegas good customer service clean and friendly atmosphere the food was excellent."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here before and it was good, but this last time there was a hearing problem with the order taker for delivery.  I asked for a baked spaghetti and meatballs, with 2 side orders of meatballs.  Of course my baked spaghetti and MBalls had no meatballs.  When I called to tell them I was short 2 meatballs, she said that the order taker got it wrong.  I told her that I repeated it 3 times.  Basically, Oh well was the tone.  Needless to say someone went without meatballs.  You would think they'd make it right.  I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Delivered early, great food, great prices and very friendly service! Grateful for this place."}
{"text":"I know the pizza here is really great but decided to try something different (delivery). Absolutely fabulous!! Is what I have to say about the half order of baby back ribs with fries and Greek salad. So very pleased to enjoy authentic, meaty ribs and excellent bbq sauce....almost as good as mom used to make many moons ago :) The ribs temp was perfect, as if I recently pulled them from the oven. And the Greek salad (served with tasty toasted garlic bread) was delicious, all the right elements and in exactly the correct proportions. Yummy! Plus delivery is always very fast, and even better because all drivers are kind and super courteous. \"Thank you Lino's!!\" from a very happy (and kinda new to Las Vegas) customer."}
{"text":"Great place for a family lunch/dinner...fast and friendly customer service..thin crust pizza just the way i like it...huge fan of their pasta made to the order and not just microwaved like most pizza places do...ill definitely come back again and reccomend to all of my friends!! 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"I took my dad there to eat for Father's Day. The food was out of this world and the service was excellent! I would recommend this place to anyone who loves italian food."}
{"text":"Food was great!!! Great service and the waitress was very fast! The hot fingers with fries were so delicious I love the sauce!!"}
{"text":"We have been visiting this place for almost 10 years, as we live around the corner they know us well. The food here is great. There is nothing we have ordered that wasn't spectacular. From the pastas to the pizzas and everything in between they are the best on this side of town and our favorite pizza shop by far. However they previously raised the prices on all the pastas and it really made it too expensive to order any more so we completely stopped ordering their pasta. We always get thin crust with pepperoni, and man is it delicious. The carryout special is our go-to as it was the best value on their menu and one of the best pizza values in town, however they just raised the price on the carryout special, and its not such a deal for us anymore.. We are very sorry to say we will no longer be offering them our business. It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye, Lino's. You gave us many years of fond memories and great food, and we are sad to see that ending. Farewell."}
{"text":"I paid extra to have black olives on the pizza, no black olives. Foods good but looks like they are idiots."}
{"text":"I thought this pizza was great! Reasonable price, thin crust and very tasty.  My friends bother  said it's the best pizza he has had since living here in Vegas"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and food was really good as well!!! We will definitely order again!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas by far! The beef meatball is so amazing and the mushrooms too! The pizza has so much flavor, I eat it with a side of hot wing sauce. The crust is pretty nice too. 

I love this pizza place. I've been eating here for over 4 years. Even though I moved clear across town I'll sometimes make the 45 minute drive just to eat the pizza.

The service is okay. It's weird they always have like 4 people there but just one girl helping.


They need more locations!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza and wings in North Las Vegas. Always fresh and hot when they deliver! This place has become a family favorite go to for our pizza nights. Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and salad for takeout on the way home from work.  Pizza was very thin which I loved, but the cheese wasn't tasty and the veggies were just blah. The salads were gross.  The tomatoes looked like they had just been recovered from the dumpster.  Man, I miss good pizza in Las Vegas.  Where are you?!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for over 2 years. We've ordered the pepperoni pizza, Hawaiian pizza, chicken wings and fries, and chicken alfredo. We are never disappointed...always delicious! And the ranch is so good...not watered down like other places"}
{"text":"I live very close to this place so I have been a frequent customer for years. The pizza is very good! I love the fries, they are always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think they make their own ranch, it is the best ranch dressing I've ever had. Their subs are also pretty good. One thing I absolutely hated was the cheesy garlic bread, it was not edible. After all the years eating here, I had one bad experience a couple months ago, there was a long thick black hair baked into the pizza dough!! It was horrifying, I called in to let them know and they only gave me a 10% off my next purchase. But other than that experience this place is really good and fast delivery (on weekdays that is, weekend delivery is ridiculous takes an hour+ and I literally live less than 5 minutes away)."}
{"text":"Since I moved from Boston to Vegas it's so hard to find good pizza. This by far is my favorite place. Pizza and food is all great. I like the large cheese 6.99 pick up special or my other go to is the chicken Alfredo. Love this place will always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Lino's many times and I've always been happy with it. This time however, I am very unhappy. The plastic lid on the food was broken so that it just laid on top of the plate. The food came hot and timely but every time I took a bite there was pieces of plastic in it. The plastic is clear so l couldn't see it. The pasta on the bottom layer had no sauce on it. I gave it 2 stars because the side order of meatballs was good. I'm a senior citizen on a  fixed income and I can't afford to throw my money away. I usually have it for 2 days, but this time I threw it out. I tried to call the restaurant to tell them but they didn't pick up the phone. I think I'll try a different restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I travel across town to get their pizza. Always great pizza and friendly service."}
{"text":"We came in here within 30 minutes of closing. 

It was excellent, had the Manicotti and loved it. Two of us shared a single order with a salad and calamari. We had an extra meal of left overs. 

The quality of the food was great, there was nothing wrong there. The pizzas that we saw looked great. The service was great.

I was informed that they were moving in about 4 weeks to another location, I think they are going to move in about two weeks from now. That was the only downfall, was the fact that the decore wasn't great, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Nice atmosphere. Our go to atleast once a week.
Try the take out pizza special. They're knots are delicious
Lasagna special is great too"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town we always go there my friends family we enjoy # 1 place I do recommend that place to anybody would like good enjoy."}
{"text":"Always delicious pizza delivered. Never have any issues with my order and always great customer service from young lady on the phone who takes my order. Italian pizza and cannoli was delicious tonight."}
{"text":"My dad liked his spaghetti & meaTballs, but I thought the texture looked like dog food, not beef.  My lasagna was lacking not only meat in the meat sauce but flavor.  Server was fine but not eapecially cheery.  Not likely to go back, it's more than 5mi from my house.  Ranch on the salad wa good, but I'm not a fan of shredded lettuce salad.  They honor military and senior discount."}
{"text":"I waited 50 minutes for burnt pizza fries and a sub . If you are gonna make me wait please don't show up with burnt food this is unacceptable"}
{"text":"Walked in yesterday hopeful to try some delicious authentic Italian food. My bf and I ordered calamari as an appetizer it was okay. The marinara sauce was good. I ordered the shrimp fettuccini. It was flavorless and bland. The Alfredo sauce tasted like milk! My bf ordered the lasagna that tasted okay nothing special. Too overpriced for what we got. I'm going back to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Today I had my lunch. I ordered chicken Alfredo pink with pink souse and calamari . Everything was really fresh and hot. Small family business nice service quite place for family . Will be back for sure ."}
{"text":"Normally just get pizza which is pretty good but Friday it was only me home so decided to get shrimp scampi. Big BIG mistake. 15.99 for 4 jumbo shrimp and the tail of a 5th. Sauce was absolutely horrible and cold. Beyond disappointed ended up throwing it out and going to mcdonalds. :("}
{"text":"Any time we have friends come into town we always want to take them to Linos. Though most of the time we do pick up when we do go inside. the staff that works there is so friendly and it feels like family. The salads are massive and delicious and the crust on the pizza is heaven. Also their new location is nice and has way more room."}
{"text":"If You want good service great pizza without a long wait Leno's is the place . We love Leo's .  My personal favorite is meat ball, sausage , Pepperoni and garlic pizza but who could do the nose without garlic knots ."}
{"text":"Omg. I ordered an xl Hawaiian Pizza. Delivery was fast. I opened the pizza box and saw the thinnest pizza I ever saw in my life. There were 11 pieces of sliced ham, not Canadian bacon on it. There were 14 small chunks of pineapple.  Skimpy. The pizza was  floppy. I will never ever order from here again. I will go to sams club. Blaaaaaaah."}
{"text":"I've order a few times. Food sucks and not to mention I'd order a desert they forgot it!
When I asked the delivery guy to come back to deliver it he said they were to far and they were busy.
I called to ask them to deliver my cheesecake and add another not only did they still charge me for it but were rude about the whole thing.
Never ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"Won't eat here again. Ordered the calamari, Italian calzone, and oven roasted chicken. Calamari tasted like a day old. Calzone wasn't cooked and no taste. Chicken was very dry with no taste. They need a change. Only thing was good was the fast delivery within 20 mins."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 7 years, loved their pastrami sandwiches. After owners changed a few years back, the quality of food changed as well. I went there yesterday with my sister to have a sandwich and when it came time to pay, we handed the waitress the $20 gift certificate that I bought there back in January for my sister's birthday. The waitress informed me that the Owner would not allow us to use it, as they don't do gift certificates! Now, I had the cert in hand, with their check tablet receipt and their writing. We asked for the owner to come out and he proceeded to yell at me and argue for a good 5 minutes as to why he wont accept it. He even asked who gave it to me and what was her name, as if I remember from January! I told him whatever empoyee he had at that time! I asked him where my $20 went then in January? He kept saying they dont do certificates. I asked him if I then had gone behind the register to write myself my own gift certificate from his restaurant back in January? He still argued with me then told his waitress to tell us he would call the cops if we didnt pay the full bill. So my sister got her phone out and started dialing and the waitress came back out to us and said he'd finally \"agreed\" to let us use it. Keep in mind, we ONLY had 2 pastrami sandwiches and 2 sodas and the bill was $32!! Service was horrible and it's wayyy too pricey for just 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks. We will NOT go back after getting this treatment from the Owner no less! They've lost some long time customers and they dont even care."}
{"text":"Omg, the stuffed shells are AMAZING. Got w meatballs on side- highly recommend. Delivery guy is nice too."}
{"text":"Lino's is my favorite place for fantastic pizza in Las Vegas.  Great food & service...reminds me of home...NY!  I recommend if you have a craving for pizza...this is the place...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I got the crappers... but besides that I enjoyed the food. They also had fast delivery!"}
{"text":"We just has lunch here and it was delicious. We had a thin crust, cheese pizza, which was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The prices are very reasonable and service was excellent. It's a bit of a drive from my house, but I will definitely make the trip to visit Lino's again."}
{"text":"This is the only place my husband will eat pizza from.  The kids love the chicken fingers and i order the Spaghetti Olio.  Something for everyone!  We've been eating here for years and plan on many more!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Very nice service both times I've been here. After moving to this area this is my go-to spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD! 
This was our first order with Lino's. I'm always skeptical about ordering Calzones due to the fact that other than the old metro pizza Calzones, I've never found one acceptable. I ordered the cheese Calzone with ham and spinach and it was off the chart AMAZING! It could have literally fed 3 people! The marinara was good (could use a little garlic) and served hot. I'll definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a lot. Their imperial pasta used to be a lot better and they have started skimping on the seafood which at a pricy dish, should be more. The garlic bread isn't made with much care. The carrot cake comes to you frozen and their delivery driver is reasonably nice. I got the calamari once and it was very salty. When I called the restaurant back (which I never do) and alerted them to it, the lady was very rude and said there was nothing she could do about it. For an ok overpriced place I'd say order from here. Have never tried their pizza though."}
{"text":"Great pizza!   The fettecini is really good as well.  The sub sandwiches are great too, we really like the bread they use.  Reasonably priced as well.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, I paid $25.00 for two sandwiches with two slices of meat on my Italian sub their was no salami on the sub. My pastrami  had very little meat on the sandwich. The bread was hard on the pastrami. Thank you Lino for ripping us off....NEVER COMING BACK...MY FIRST AND LAST TIME TO YOUR BUSINESS."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, nice people. I love taking my sons there for a guys day out. The 18\" pizza is perfect for 4 hungry boys. We will be back...:)"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time and always put up with rude service but today was the last straw we ordered supreme got home and realized it had plain ass tomato I called back and all they could say was sorry??? I mean come on and on top of that wanted us to bring it back my family already started eating it!! Never again!! 

-Monisa!!"}
{"text":"I ordered using GrubHub at 6:13pm. I received an update stating that my food should arrive by 7:20pm. I called at 7:25pm and a woman answered the phone. I informed her that I had made an order via GrubHub and what not. She then asked if I got the updated message about my food going to be about 15 minutes late. I told her I did, but it's now passed that time. She then told me the most shocking thing I'd ever heard a person at a business say...  \"I don't have x-ray vision, low-jack, or know exactly where my drivers are at every second.\" WOW. I asked to please speak to a manager, and she said she WAS the manager. So, I then said I don't appreciate your language. She snapped back quickly with \"I didn't use any foul language, I just said I don't know the exact location of all my drivers!\" I then told her that you don't tell your customers that \"I don't have x-ray vision\" to know when the drivers will be there. 

The gentleman driver had stopped at the address ONE number off from my address and was literally down there for like 30 seconds trying to figure out why no one is answering the door. He looked up and noted me standing outside looking rather annoyed. He drove over and told me that \"he sometimes has a hard time seeing\". My thought was, \"why are you driving!\" 

NOW, once we got the food....finally at 7:33pm, my noodle and shrimp dish didn't taste all that great. I think they used a different type of oil or something when they cooked the noodles. The shrimp was rather tough, but it was ok. The garlic piece of bread was a little \"cold\" when we got it. My husband's dish was good (ribs with fries). I also got a slice of cheese cake, and it was PERFECT.

An update....I woke up this Monday morning and, well, sorry....that Fettuccine and Shrimp I ordered had gone bad. I have been sick since about 2am Monday morning. It's not about 12:30pm Monday, and I'm still not quite back to normal."}
{"text":"Had a large cheese pizza and a Greek Salad, baklava and cannoli.  Pizza was good, served hot. Kids really liked the pizza. Salad was fresh. House dressing was good. Free garlic knots with yelp check in. Very good knots. Dessert was standard. Place was not busy at all. Definitely not professional waiters but good service."}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints! Hands down the absolute best pizza place in Vegas! They have a 2 slice cheese pizza special with a drink for $4.95 you can add toppings for .50 each up till 4pm. They offer a free order of garlic knots with a Yelp Check in. They're so good! They also have a pick up special for a 16\" cheese pizza for $6.99 you can add toppings for $1.75 ea or $2.25 for chicken. I highly recommend Lino's for any pizza craving!!!"}
{"text":"I had gnocchi delivered. Great service, killer food. I couldn't eat all of it due to the large portion size. But it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Horrible service and DIRTY!!! Only 1 other person there..a sure sign. Service was DIRTY! Read other reviews including from past employees! This place is a health hazard! If that doesn't entice you...the \"pleasant\" attitude of the disgruntled little elf that seems to be the owner will no doubt amuze you."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Too bad I didn't realize until I was walking out that the restaurant had a B rating from the health department. It's no wonder. I ordered a two slice special and noticed (far too late) there was a hair on my pizza. After returning to make them aware the cashier apologized in a friendly manner and assured they'd get me a new pizza. I came back to pick my pizza up just to find it was the same pizza, simply reheated and with the hair removed. Nice to know they care so much about the health hazards they may cause their customers. Had they gone out of their way to truly fix the issue I may have decided to still return. Not anymore! Disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is subpar compared to other pizza options nearby. Worst customer service I've had in a long time. From the girl that takes your order to the guy that delivers it, they're either really unhappy with their job or they hate clients for some reason. I've only ordered twice from this place and will not order again."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I can't believe how below par this pizza was. I ordered Spinach Pizza with added chicken for $20 and it was absolutely hands down the cheapest ingredients, most tasteless pizza experience of my life. We also had the Greek Pizza which was dry, tasteless, uninspired and absolutely nothing Greek about it! Another wasted $20 for a Large. I would also advise against the roasted chicken as it is crap. You can grab better chicken from Albertsons grab and go. The ingredients for this pizza chain are cheap, flavorlessly prepared and no signs of \"love\" on my pizzas! Will never order again!  It's not often I give zero stars, but my entire family was truly let down by these pizzas."}
{"text":"We went to Lino's first time (Valley and Craig) last night. The service was iffy but not too slow. Only one person serving and answering the phone. The food was good Italian. We will go back. The pizza's looked good with the thin crust I like. My shrimp and Linguini great. Shrimp were large and garlic cream sauce was delicious. Calazone was good, cheese inside with the meat and veggies tasty.  For a small strip mall place it was several steps above fast food. VERY casual. Can only seat 20 plus."}
{"text":"We order pizza every Friday and this was the closest to our house according to Yelp. I ordered a Large pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni w/ mushrooms and bell peppers, and also the chicken wings and fries. They were quick and the pizza was nice and hot. My daughter enjoyed her wings. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Horrible customer service. I am getting ready to head to the airport and decide to grab a bite to eat. So I stop there. It was 9:30pm, and being a culinarian I asked what time they closed. I was told 10:00pm. So I order some wings and fries. I then said, it can be a to go order but can I eat it here... I'm told no because they were closing early. Then I hear them take another food order, for delivery at that... So I ask for the manager and I ask for my money back... Now all of a sudden I'm told I can do the order for dine in. At this point, I just want my money back and to leave. Then the manager says give her the money back and make it so she can't come back. I informed that I don't plan on ever coming back and asked if they want my name."}
{"text":"Great job Lino's pizzeria!
I ordered the takeout Cheese pizza ($6.99)and Lasagna dinner ($10.99) thru the website for takeout and they nailed it. I picked up and rushed home to be greeted by hot, freshly prepared food that had great flavor and lots of high quality ingredients.
The small dining room and the kitchen looked to be clean and organized, great first impressions. Next time I will order a side of meatballs as the lasagna didn't have any meat in it but was more of a cheesy delight and rich with mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The sauce was the perfect saltiness for my tastes and featured garlic and herbs, very tasty in the lasagna. I can't wait to try the meatballs, I hope they are really good. 
I was greeted when I walked in by a lady that was obviously a pro in customer service, what little interaction I had with her was pleasant and very efficient, how refreshing. Thank you for the lovely dinner and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We ordered for deliver a few days ago and were pleasantly surprised. We had the Lino's and it was yummy. Crust was delicious and the toppings were nice and fresh. I could have just eaten the cheese. The true test was the next day when I ate the leftovers...yep, they passed. So glad we found a new pizza place to add to our take out list."}
{"text":"5 stars isn't enough! I love the pizza! Being from the east coast I'm a snob about pizza, and this place is legit. 6.99 for a 16\" pizza on carryout you can't beat. The shrimp alfredo is my second favorite. The staff is great and the cooks know what they are doing! Great place for a date as well!!"}
{"text":"We are so happy we found this place!  We've only lived in LV for a little over a year and have had a hard time finding a good pie!  Lino's is great!"}
{"text":"We order delivery or take out here. I have tried just about everything. 
 Pizza , dough is fresh and crunchy, sauce is delish, toppings are always generous. 
 Pasta.. Yummmm. Freaking yumm. From the lasagna to the Alfredo ... Tastes just like my grandmas... 
 Sandwiches offer a lighter meal option. Never had one here that wasn't worth the money. 
Salads are as expected. Fresh.
Deserts... Some are pre packaged. A few are homemade.   
 Delivery time ( I live a long ways away) is always quick

 Its a little hole in the wall place ... Which I prefer.. Prices are reasonable , and staff are professional.  Only 4 stars because they need a restaurant.
. but I'll happily wait... 

 Tip your driver!!!
  
 Thanks Lino's!!!"}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the best pizza I have had in ages!!!  The crust was homemade...no prefab!! Toppings were fresh and delicious!!  We also had a greek salad which was equally as delicious.  Homemade dressing; and, more than enough for two hungry eaters!! Amber, our waitress was terrific.  We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24, it came earlier than expected. We got the Greek salad and ham sub with a side salad. The lettuce was 99% iceberg, but it was still good. The sub was huge, I got it to feed two children but it could of fed four. I really like the lunch specials menu! 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Lino's multiple times in the past. Never again. I experienced some of the worst customer service of my life tonight. The male cashier with an east coast accent started telling me, in an unnecessarily loud voice, while there were other customers inside, when I went in to purchase and pickup my pizza, that the owner had told him to possibly not service me anymore, due to the last time I was in. (I had taken the lid off of the clogged parmesan cheese sprinkler, to put parmesan cheese on my pizza ) I was shocked. I would've left right then and there but my card was already in the machine. The cashier was super loud and I was berated. (The couple there that was dining felt uncomfortable, too, because their demeanor changed from laughing, to getting up and leaving very shortly after the cashier started to run his mouth. )The owner was mad that his parmesan cheese dispenser is clogged and so a customer takes it off to sprinkle the cheese on the pizza? How about you guys actually, I don't know, CLEAN your cheese dispensers once in a while so that they're not so clogged? Also, there's a weird cook in the back who just STARES at you through the hole with a serious, unhappy, look on his face...every time...CREEPY!!! I see other negative reviews in regards to customer service with this place. Now, I've experienced it myself. If you're thinking about trying out a new pizza place,  DO NOT GO TO DINOS!"}
{"text":"Our first time ordering from Lino's and it was great! Delivery was quick and pizza was delicious! We've been searching for a good pizza place and kept getting disappointed by others in the area, finally our pizza search is over!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible... Food was great but you better tell them if you need plastic ware or napkins.
We were remodeling a house and did not know we needed to ask when ordering. When we called to find out why we were basically told too bad... You need to ask when ordering.
No offer to help us out and we needed to go to a gas station to get what we needed to eat. Lack of customer service will prevent us from returning."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time for delivery. The order came on time and was correct. I have definitely had better pizza, and I would have given more stars, but there was barely any pepperoni on it. The average amount of pepperoni per slice was 2. The pizza tasted fine, but that is ridiculous. When I order a pepperoni pizza I expect pepperoni. Next time I will save my money and order from one of the chains."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried many delivery pizza and this place by far is the best ever! Delivery took a while since we ordered on a busy day but the delicious pizza delivered  made up for it, definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Linos is the best little secret around . 
My husband and I happened to go in there one Saturday and we were very pleased with the good food. Lino gets to work every morning by 6am to start cooking for the day . 
We had a great meal and we went back the following week and we were also very happy with the food.
This is definitely our go-to Italian restaurant. 
The prices are pretty low for the exceptional quality of food . 
Love it here"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of mom and pop places and this place is definately that. The dining area is small probably only 6-8 tables. The staff is friendly and attentative. The owner will often come out and inquire about the meal. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. 

I have had several of the baked pasta dishes and am impressed because there is always a thick layer of hot bubbling cheese on top. The pasta dishes are served with a large basket of garlic bread that has a great flavor and is super crispy. 

I have never eaten the pizza, but it always smells super good."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bring you dirty water and are nasty when you complain I wouldn't go there if it was free"}
{"text":"Amazing service, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the garlic knots, fried zucchini and fried mushrooms for an appetizer and our favorite was the zucchini. We also ordered the Greek pizza and the chicken ranch pizza. Both were good but way way greasier than we prefer. We are not really New York Style people but we still enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in North Las Vegas. They don't skimp on toppings and the mozzarella cheese is always piping hot and delicious. It's hard not to get burned impatiently waiting for your pizza slice to cool down. I love Lino's."}
{"text":"The Lino's special pizza is to DIE for!  Salads are good.  We order from here for lunch all the time. Delivery is timely, though we can never figure out if the tip is already included (each driver seems to say something different).  When I order, sometimes the guy answers that always calls me baby.  If you can look over that, the ordering is fine.  Every once in a while they get an order wrong.
Overall, great experience and decent lunch specials.  The subs are good too!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I just ordered and my picky ( but older) kids are loving it! Burgers, Philly sandwich, chicken wings, canolis, tiramisu..all of it awesome..they delivered quick, good prices n the food was nice n hot when it got here! Easy and accurate online ordering a major plus! Thanks guys..well definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"My daughter went the first time for lunch and ordered Lino's Calzone. What a treat! The crust, ham, cheese,peppers, was the best experience we had since we moved here In November 2017. We went back again this week to repeat the great experience. Thank you Lino's"}
{"text":"Lasagna chef salad Greek salad and ranch chicken pizza are my favorites delivery is dependable all good"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The girl who took the phone order was wonderful, the delivery guy was fast. But I paid 22 dollars plus a 6 dollar tip for 1 pasta entree... It was the linguini imperial and it was cold with no sauce... Literally it was obviously clams that have been cooked from a frozen state on top of linguini with 3 shrimp. No sauce, I had to reheat and season despite the quick delivery. Called, didn't want my money back just a credit. (It was my first and now my last time here.) Spoke to a manager who was also the disgruntled cook- he said he was unwilling to do anything for me. People with no customer service have no business managing a restaurant. Made both of his other two employees null and void. It didn't matter how nice they were, he ruined it."}
{"text":"My fiance surprised me with a impromptu lunch date. I had a garden salad and fried mozzarella which were both good.  My fiance had a pepperoni and sausage calzone that was also very good. The service was nice and attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time I took my girlfriend here we waited 45 minutes to learn that our pizza order wasn't placed.  Since she was mad we decided to leave...still charged us for salad and soda and a lady in back came out making all kinds of excuses.  You messed up...own it!  My girlfriend swore we would never, but the other night she had other plans and since this place had such high reviews I decided to give it another try.  This time the pizza was good. Took about 30 minutes even though I was the only person. Crispy crust and lots of stringy cheese flowing all over.  I doubt that my girlfriend will ever go back, but they did redeem themselves to me.  Food is good even if service is slow and sketcky."}
{"text":"Just love this place  Lino's is a hidden gem. Staff is always on point and foods always the same. They know how to treat their customers"}
{"text":"This place is bomba, gotta try the lino's calzone, well done. Make sure to try the house ranch. The Greek pizza well done, thin crust is also really good."}
{"text":"Once again never let down I just love this place you guys let me tell you I always dine in here because its so close to my work place. The pizza is never a let down I like the crispiness and the flavors are amazing, my husband goes nuts for the chicken alfredo. Anyways great food, great portions, amazing staff and a wonderful place for a family dine in or a pick up or delivery."}
{"text":"We have only had their food to-go. Obviously, to-go you sacrifice some freshness. We don't live that far away so our food is usually still nice and hot. 

My husband orders some seafood pasta dish that I never care to taste, ask about it, etc...since I'm allergic to seafood. 

I, on the other hand, have had their lasagna and their chicken parmesan sandwich. So good!!! It certainly fulfills that chicken parmesan sandwich crave or lasagna crave. I can't complain about steep prices because Italian fare is usually on a pricey scale so I always expect to drop some $$ whenever we have Italian, which is seldom. But when we do...Lino's is usually on our list because not only are they good, it is also nearby. Having good food nearby is pretty slim in our neck of the woods.

Definitely recommend! Kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was really good. We had a green salad & fettuccini alfredo. The portions were plenty for 2 adults and tasted delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lasagna is excellent (and I typically do not like it.) We went to one of
the chain Italian restaurants tonight.  We
will never make that mistake again and Lino's will be where we go when we go for Italian!!!"}
{"text":"I thought I would order from this Lino's because the Linos on Ann road is pretty good.  We ordered 2 pizzas and wings.  It took an hour and 15 minutes for delivery...whatever.

The crust was okay on the pizzas not thin...not thick. 

The problem lay within the toppings.  No taste cheese and that rounded fluffy no flavor sausage.  That is the super cheap frozen food section supermarket sausage..... When I order sausage on my pizza I am wanting Italian sausage.  That isn't asking for much is it?

Summary; slow delivery. okay crust, bland cheese, poor sausage, average prices.  I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This little gold mine makes the best pizzas, makes the best spaghetti, and makes the best raviolis that we have tasted. It is a grade A with the health department. You can always tell if the place is clean by their bathrooms and their bathrooms are very very clean.. if you place an order by the phone to be picked up please have patience in putting your order. They are always busy. Great job Mark thank you for serving us with a happy smile."}
{"text":"Found this lil gem the other night .... great prices . Awesome service and the food is amazing ! We will be back"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery- pizza was ok. The driver was definitely not the friendliest person lol."}
{"text":"I love ordering from this place!  They are so prompt to deliver and the pizza is always piping hot.
The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because of some of their portions. Cold subs never have much on them. ... just lots of bread. And they could definitely be more generous with the pizza toppings. Very sparse as is.
Other than that, very tasty, very friendly, and will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed. I have tried different menu items to switch it up and have loved every bite."}
{"text":"The order was delivered fast steaming hot and delicious, we will definitely order from them again"}
{"text":"Amazing food... nothing at all to complain about to be honest. Delivery was exactly on time if not earlier then promised. The food was great and very fresh when it arrived. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for the perfect pizza and as a yelper I would say this place deserves a five star rating. Lino's Pizzeria is one of the best pizza places I've tried if not the best!!!"}
{"text":"Cute lil spot, me and my bf drove by and saw this place an decided to give it a try food was really good, our waitress (Christina) was really nice, I like that she checked in on us to make sure we didn't need anything and to refill our drinks. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24. Everything was ready when I arrived. Pizza and baked tortellini were delicious! Ordered the 18\" Lino Special - enough for 4 people easy. Small strip location -great for pickup or delivery. Not ideal to dine in, but thats ok...
Crust is New York style, toppings are thick and sauce is light. My girls loved it..
Note: Friend used them to cater Italian dishes and everyone loved it."}
{"text":"The lasagna and the spaghetti were awesome! But...the large pepperoni sure didn't look like the ones in these pictures it had about 2 pepperoni's per slice. 

Went back for spaghetti again. Perfect! Thank you"}
