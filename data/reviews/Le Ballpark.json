{"text":"Quatre étoiles bien méritées pour ce sympathique restaurant montréalais à la décoration léchée et aux assiettes délicieuses. J'y ai mangé les meilleures frites qu'il m'ait été donné de goûter, délicatement assaisonnées aux herbes, en accompagnement d'une douzaine d'huîtres au tarif honnête. J'ai été séduit par les boulettes de buf bourguignon (attention, la carte change régulièrement), bien que j'aurais apprécié une assiette plus généreuse, compte tenu du prix facturé et des portions nord-américaines habituelles (trois boulettes pour 7$, taxes en sus). En revanche, les croquettes de pommes de terre commandées en accompagnement m'ont quelque peu déçu. Une belle découverte !"}
{"text":"As good as it gets ! Food was amazing. I had the ceasar salad, tandoori meatballs & risotto. The price is very reasonable & the drinks are very generous.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food with a great price  Very fun place.  The food is very good as is the service.  The fried calamari is excellent.  Not too greasy and the batter is just perfect.  The French of ion soup was very good.  The Cesar salad was good.  We shared 3 orders of meatballs: buttered chicken, bahji (didn't spell this right), and the tomato ones.  All excellent!  Dessert consisted of an ice cream sandwich which was ice cream between 2 chocolate chip cookies.  Very yummy.  This place is worth going."}
{"text":"Their food is soooooooo delicious!!!! Everything we ordered was perfect. Also, each course's presentation is stunningly beautiful. The four of us are so thrilled with our first Canadian food experience.  Most importantly, staff is super nice and sweet!"}
{"text":"Good meatballs and salad. I liked the ambiance as well. The cocktails are just average."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot with a cozy ambiance $1 oysters if you order an appetizer with it. The service is also excellent and waitress is very friendly"}
{"text":"At le ballpark there's an great choice of funky music, yummy food, great service, excellent price/ quality and a cool decor. An excellent place to chill and/ or eat.  Warmly recommended!"}
{"text":"A definite favorite in Mile-Ex, with the butter chicken meatballs coming highly recommended. The salads are all large portions, personally really love the beets. For drinks, the black cherry cola is my top pick. Perfect for hosting almost any group of friends or colleagues, as its casual enough but not too dressed down."}
{"text":"First time we came here we were blown away. Great food, great service and really close by. We shared everything and it was all tasty and really well priced, especially for a restaurant with such a nice feel and atmosphere.   The risotto is simply amazing, but tastes more like a rice version of mac and cheese. Let it be known. Also, the raita had dill in it, which is not a traditional herb in raita. Not liking dill, I feel they should have labeled it as a dill raita.   The last two times we went, the food just wasn't as good as our first visit. However, service and cocktails were still excellent and we're definitely going to go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Wow, wow et rewow ! Cela fait près de 9 ans que mon père et moi essayons un nouveau restaurant pour ma fête et c'est par hasard que nous nous sommes présentés au Ballpark puisque nous n'avons pas eu de place dans le restaurant que nous avions sélectionné. Quelle belle surprise ! Nous avons mangé une quantité de nourriture incroyable, nous avons commencé avec une assiette de 6 huitres, ensuite un Tartare de boeuf au jalapeno avec des éperlans frit (je crois que c'est sa le nom, désole d'avance si je me trompe de poisson). Pour continuer, nous avons choisi l'assiette de Mac'n'cheese avec deux assiettes de boulettes.  je peux vous confirmer qu'en sortant du restaurant j'avais l'impression d'être aussi rond que les boulettes que j'avais mangé !  Sincèrement, je n'étais pas sûr que les boulettes de viande étaient un bon choix pour une spécialité dans un restaurant, mais finalement il mérite bien d'être les rois de ce plat. Je vais retourner à ce resto avec ma blonde et des amis c'est certain."}
{"text":"We found a little hidden gem in Little Italy where you can oysters every night for $1! A dream. Until 23h. Isn't that AMAZING? Their specialty is \"balls\" of all kinds.  Meat, fish and even desert ballzzz! Cool decor, upside-down lamps on the ceiling, lots of wood, a bit hipster but with a touch of classy ;) lol We got there early and just in time before the crowds and groups; which is around 19h. But it was a Thursday night, always a little busier out :)  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"How does this place review so well??? This was easily one of the saddest foodie experiences I've had in a looong while. First, the two stars go to the service we received, since both servers we encountered in our short stay were very nice and attentive. I guess the $1 oysters (which came with a very good gingery vinegar) should also be in those two stars, cause even with that $1 deal, I'm not giving them a 3/5. Cocktails are a disaster. My dining companion ordered the Jack Rose cocktail and we literally both were at a loss for words when it came out in a glass the size of a Moroccan tea glass! Tiny, tiny, and as the server left, we both agreed it better be the damn best tasting cocktail around to make up for its diminutive stature.... I don't believe it was the case, as she didn't order another and there were no oohs or aahs as she sipped. My whisky sour tasted simply of whisky, no complexity or sourness/tartness to it. On to the menu! Oh yeah, wait, is there a theme going on here? Miniscule cocktail, mini menu?? About ten items on the menu, with probably five apps and five \"mains\" consisting of various meat or meatless balls. The only appetizer that caught my eye was a veggie dish with broccoli and bean sprouts (if memory serves) but on second reading, I saw it came with cheese whiz. I've never had the *pleasure* of ingesting that mix of chemicals masquerading as a cheese product and I wasn't about to start now. For the balls, there was a chicken stroganoff ball, regular beef meatball, a meatloaf, some shrimp and smoked salmon concoction that didn't seem at all appetizing and a lentil-based ball. I might be missing a dish, but shows you how memorable the reading of it was if I cant remember one day later. We ordered the lentil-based balls just to order something besides the oysters my friend was getting, and wow, how great, three mini balls come out on a bed of pureed spinach for the lovely price of $14.50! They were uninspired, dry falafel balls basically. Oy!!! We both tried to figure out why people kept coming in, and my best guess is the good $1 oysters or maybe some beer or wine to which I didn't pay attention. We came, we saw (not much!), we paid and we left (still in a daze at what we saw), to head across to Dinette Triple Crown, where our bellies rejoiced finally, and we got a great and normal-sized cocktail like expected!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and a great addition to little Italy! This restaurant specializes in meatballs in all kinds of different flavors and sizes. Their meatball Poutine (polpoutine I believe) a traditional Poutine with tiny meatballs in it, was a great starter and the tiny meatballs were well seasoned and tender... Will definitely go back and try more of their stuff!"}
{"text":"Everything was great: the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and the staff.  We went in for a quick bite before dinner and would have rather stayed there for the whole evening. Very welcoming place: the staff made us feel right at home. We had drinks, fried pickles and the fish arancini balls: they all were awesome!"}
{"text":"Délicieux. Bonnes portions. Service chaleureux et courtois. Toilettes propres et bien décorées. Le sandwich du midi aux boulettes de porc gingembre vraiment délectable. Prix raisonnable. Donne vraiment envie de revenir. Félicitations."}
{"text":"Sympathique resto de quartier au concept original. L'ambiance est classe mais décontract', et la déco très bien pensée. Comme éclairage au plafond? Des lampes de salon à l'envers, jusqu'aux fils électriques.  On bâti son repas en choisissant ses boulettes (toutes 3 pour 7$), comme poisson et sauce tartare, agneau à la méditerranéenne, oignon bhaji, etc. Puis, on y rajoute 1 ou 2 accompagnements, tels que des légumes tempura ou un délicieux risotto aux champignons.  Parfait pour partager à deux ou à plusieurs. Les prix sont sommes toutes très abordables. J'y retournerai assurément! Vive la boulette!"}
{"text":"Oysters : Price-tag of $1 is nice but I found them relatively small. Tasted very good and house vinaigrette was yummy. (4/5)  Phil Collins : Quite sour! There are many varieties of this drink and this one was strong and sour. Wasn't a fan at all. Yuck. (1/5)  Caesar Salad : Odd presentation, which seems to be a slice of iceberg lettuce with some \"Caesar salad\" toppings. Little plate, can't really mix it. Confusing. (2/5)  Pulled Pork Sandwich : Tasted strongly of ketchup, meat was tender though. Sauce wasn't for me. (2/5)  Meatballs : We ordered a variety of meatballs (fish/crab) and they were the best thing we tasted. Shame they only come in bowls of 3. At $10-13 a bowl they're basically $3-4 each. They aren't huge balls neither. (4/5)  Service was nice, decent turn-around time... was practically empty at 6 PM on a Monday.  Kind of a mixed bag for me. This place is ideal for a hang-out with friends to have a few appetizer plates and drink a few drinks. Unfortunately, my first drink was terrible and priced at nearly $10, I wasn't willing to commit to another. Most items on this menu are priced what I'd call above average. 3 smallish meatballs at $12 leaves it to be desired. I could cross the park and go to Bottega and have one of their fantastic veal polpette in tomato sauce at the same price and it's not a competition.  The \"Caesar salad\" was a slice of iceberg lettuce priced $9. Ridiculous.  It seems they change their menu a lot since older pictures look quite different, which is kind of cool since they're experimenting things but at the same time, I was very MEH about my experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for the first time and had the good fortune of staying up the road from Le Ballpark. Guillaume is a wonderful host. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and like special guests. The food was delicious and the drinks hand crafted. Unfortunately in compliance with local liquor laws they couldn't serve me as late as I would have liked. :/  Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. It is a small neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Vraiment top! Une envie d'huîtres un vendredi soir et on atterrit au Ballpark. Cocktails intéressants et full bar pour commencer, suivi des huîtres à 1$! Imbattable. Ensuite le menu... bon ok ca tient dans la poche... mais une fois l'étonnement passé, il faut bien se lancer... l'idée c'est de faire ça en mode \" tapas \"à partager. Les poppers sont excellents, ainsi que les brisket balls au fromage bleu.... Bref, j'y retournerai."}
{"text":"Ok, same star rating but I think worthy of an update because I was a bit dubious of this place before, and now it has cemented itself into a very specific place in my heart and neighbourhood.   There is a nice cozy terrasse in the summer, near Little Italy Parc, quiet and low key. You do need to order food in order to drink here, like many spots, but there are lots of small plate affordable tasty options, and if you're there on buck a shuck oyster day and you grab an affordable bottle off their tasty wine menu, and you sit in the leafy sun watching the world go by and chatting with the friendly, mellow waitstaff who work here, you will not regret your life choices."}
{"text":"excellent service, bonne bouffe à bon prix, belle sélection de drinks, chouette terrasse !"}
{"text":"The Ballpark! One of my friends has been raving about this place for many months and I finally had the chance to go myself!  Well I will say one thing first. The main courses are mostly meatballs, but the appetizers and side dishes are an eclectic mix that leaves me quite surprised!  We started off with an appetizer course of calamari. Now I relatively new to calamari, I would say in the last three years, but this is hands down some excellent fried calamari. The batter is just perfect and well seasoned and the calamari itself is cooked proper, not overly chewy.   We also had a beet salad, which was quite good but very hard to such up! I am not sure what green they used, which while good, had stems which made it unwieldy.  Meatball wise, I was lucky to be in a large group and as such we ordered all of them. We ordered the 7 available that night and we were white stuffed at the end! It's all a lite bit of a food black out but I will say in particular that I liked the meatball with blue cheese. For the other preparations, most were excellent and a couple were only good, which is still pretty alright!  Special side note for the delicious tempura veggies!! These were hands down some pretty delicious tempura items. I think they have the whole frying thing figured out what with the calamari and the tempura and they should expand it!  If you go with meatballs take the tomato and cheese side dish, it is an appreciated side!"}
{"text":"$1 oysters everyday! The sauce that comes with the oysters is amazing. ..refreshing!   Really nice little restaurant in little Italy. Decor is rustic trendy.  They have a lot of different kind of meat balls served. The pork and foie gras meat balls are amazing!  Service is quite friendly as well."}
{"text":"Cool concept of a meatball oriented restaurant set in a hip and lively atmosphere.   However, the meatballs were just ok. Different types to choose from (beef, lamb, chicken, fish and veggie) and although you could taste the flavour concept behind each, they all could have been more bold in taste. The lamb ones especially could have packed more spices to bring out that gamey  lamb fragrance.   Overall, this places is a good spot to hang out with friends over some great drinks and some fun board games, but don't expect an foodie orgasms."}
{"text":"Love this little spot in the Mile-ex. Foods really good. I had the gazpacho, risotto and a few of the balls yum!  The only thing that ruined my night and worth taking a star off was the place has no AC! I was coming from work with my shirt, jacket, long pants, socks and shoes! Had I been in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops I could've bared it much better! Not a summertime place recommended for business clients at al ! Besides that, I would for sure go back... flip flops and all! ps, heads-up to the owners: I like that you're serving cocktails in regular glasses, but when you order a dirty martini and it looks like a shot you kind of feel cheated! cheers"}
{"text":"We arrived in Montréal late on a Wednesday and were wandering around the unfamiliar neighbourhood looking for somewhere to eat dinner. We happened upon Le Ballpark and decided to give it a try.  We were greeted by the friendly waiter/bartender and seated right away. He came back with menus and was kind enough to also bring us English menus. He explained the dishes to us (mostly boulettes, which are meatballs) and gave us recommendations.  We ordered several small plates to share and were not disappointed.  We ordered the smoked meat and sausage meatballs (my husband's favourite), which were served atop sauerkraut and with a sauce and pickles on top. We also had coq au vin meatballs which had mashed potatoes and a rich gravy. The salted cod meatballs were my favourite. They were crisp on the outside with a soft, mashed potato filled centre and were served with tartar sauce. We had a dozen oysters (only $1 each!!!) that were so fresh and beautifully shucked. The waiter also brought us a local hot sauce that was made with smoked jalapenos. It was amazing with the oysters. The shrimp and pork meatballs were served with shrimp crackers and a sort of sweet, red sauce and were our son's favourite. On the side we had frites with mayo (yummy) and sautéed greens which were perfectly cooked and in an interesting sauce which tasted a little gingery. The only (tiny) complaint was that the sunflower seeds on top of the greens tasted a bit rancid. We told the waiter and he insisted on getting us a new dish without the sunflower seeds.   Every single thing we had was fantastic and I refuse to take away one star just because of the sunflower seeds as that mistake was rectified very quickly.  As amazing as the food was, the waiter was even better. He was so friendly and helpful and had us laughing several times during the meal.  If we lived in this neighbourhood, we'd be frequenting Le Ballpark weekly. Really, it's THAT good!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at around ten pm and it was pretty empty. My friend wanted to come here for drinks after our meal at Mile-ex. We didn't know this place was more of a restaurant. They made us order a dish each. So we ordered the cheeseburger poutine, a dozen oysters and the clam chowder. The poutine had onion, cheese and pickles. I was hoping it would taste like a big mac in poutine form but it didn't. It wasn't bad but it was dry and I think it could have been a lot better if they had more sauce and more cheese and minced meat. The oysters were fresh and a good size. For $1 each it's a good deal! I only had one spoonful of the soup but it was very good and rich.   I tried Dillon's gin for the first time. It's so good! I tried the rose flavored one straight at first. It was good but I needed to mix it with something so the bartender made me a cocktail with it. I then tried the strawberry flavor and that one was even better.   The restaurant is really cute. I liked the white indoor Christmas lights around the door, how people could sit all around the bar and I liked the hanging lights above it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Poutine to die for.  Drinks were great.  Most important:  incredibly creative decor, wonderful staff, and kind owner, Benedict.  This should  be on Montreal's hit parade.  We left saying, \"Now THAT was fun!!!\"  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Très jolie place dans la little italy. Malheureusement pas plus de point positif. Accueil pas remarquable, bcp d'attente. A l'arrivée des plats, on note immédiatement la petitesse des portions (3 boulettes vraiment pas bien epaisses) et un gout peu prononcé. Doute : viande congelée? Aucun problème avec ca, mais il faut veiller à bien égoutter l'eau, ça se voit et ça se ressent :-/ A noter, quelques bons accompagnements. Bref le tout inégal et assez dispendieux."}
{"text":"Gave me diarrhea. The food was nice and the place was beautiful,  but in the middle of the night after eating there and all day the day after it was diarrhea galore  So if you have Cauda Equina syndrome or if you forgot your rectal tube at the office beware.  Also poor value (food wasn't good enough to justify the price)"}
{"text":"I went there really quickly for a dinner with a colleague. I took a Pulk porc Poutine and it was really delicious. The dinning room is small and cozy."}
{"text":"Although I was skeptical about the boulette (meatball) idea, I'm pleasantly surprised by the Paella meatball! It's the most unique dish i took here- it's like satisfying your craving for a paella ? cod cake in one bite - and much better than the cod cake, because the surface is much thinner and crunchier. Although 2 plates/person is recommended, the portion is quite big. Since all meatballs and even desserts come with 3-4 balls, it's easy and fun to share among your group!   So meatballs+sidedish + half a bottle of wine + dessert to share + some amazing $1 oysters =  only $50 / person for a feast, really not bad!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and delicious food!!! Very small portions so it's a better idea to visit with a group and share plates.  We happily shared a few meat dishes and vegetable dishes. The mac and cheese was nice too. The beets salad was surprisingly good!   Prices are reasonable. Wonderful service."}
