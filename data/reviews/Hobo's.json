{"text":"Although the service was great, the food was just okay. I loved sitting outside on the patio and enjoying the fresh air. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I ordered it spicy instead of mild. It was a pretty decent size sandwich but definitely not spicy. The side order of fries were pretty good. My friend ordered the home made chips which were also  pretty good. Parking is easy, but during prime time (between 5p and 7p) it may be a little dicey to find a spot. I would go back simply for the atmosphere, oh and the drinks are pretty good. (This is a late post. I actually went last night for dinner and forgot to write a review until this morning)"}
{"text":"We came up from Florida to visit our friends here in Fort Mill. So of course when visiting another state we like to venture out from your normal chain restaurants. Did a little research, and the reviews were awesome so we decided to give it a shot. An low and behold it was fantastic, I did build your own burger and my husband did the T-Money; both burgers were phenomenal! The staff and environment were perfect!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Everything was delicious, in a great spot in Fort Mill. Try the Shakes!"}
{"text":"We finally got in after weeks of trying. Typically we try on a weekend but it's always packed. That made us continue to come back and keep trying. Great service and even better food. The chicken and waffles were amazing!"}
{"text":"It was great to see a new restaurant open up in our little town of Fort Mill, especially a burger joint.  Unfortunately after my visit last night, my excitement was short lived.

I agree with many other reviewers about the service at the restaurant. It's not the best, but you can tell the bartenders and wait staff are trying hard. When we were attended to the staff was very helpful and willing to go out of their way to assist with our beer and food choices.

The atmosphere of the place is very nice with exposed brick and a beautiful outdoor patio.  It's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks.  One if not the only place in Fort Mill with true outdoor dining that's not on a sidewalk.

Hobo's also has an impressive draft beer list that any craft beer connoisseur would be pleased with.  It includes a vast local selection as well as some national and macro brewers.  The price points aren't too bad either.

On to the food.  I was very disappointed with my entr√©e.  The burger I ordered (The Mack and Mack) was undercooked on the inside and burnt on the outside.  It tasted like a mediocre grilled burger at a cookout. The slaw tasted like it was right out of the container.  My wife's burger was about the same.  I found it funny that her burger, The Big Apple, was served on Sourdough bread that was cut as thin as Wonder Bread.

All in all this place has potential to be great if they improve their food.  I would probably go back for a drink on the patio but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there again.

Charlotte and its outlying areas have a great burger scene.  I assumed Hobo's would fall in line with this trend but I was mistaken. It's a shame we still don't have a great local place to get a good burger. 

If you are looking for a neat place to grab a craft beer or cocktail this is a great local place to go.  If you are looking for a satisfying place to grab a bite, look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Hobo's is great. I'm a long-time Fort Mill resident and I'm super glad that we have something downtown like this. I think it's brought some well needed new life to Main Street.
The grouper bites, fried banana peppers, and the black and blue Burger are all incredible.
And I definitely give them props for having a lot of local breweries on tap. I'm a big fan of supporting local, and as long as hobos stays quality like it has been I will continue to eat there regularly.
It's also a chill environment to take a date or grab a drink as well.
The only downside I can think of is that you might get an occasional fly buzzing around you since they have an opening to the bar from outside. But it's just a fly so it's nothing to cry about"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to have a beer and hang out, sure this is a good place.  If you are looking for great food, not so much.  Have been there twice now and the first time the bartender was way more interested in flirting with the 20 somethings than someone that wanted to order so after I *FINALLY* got his attention, he told me the kitchen was an hour behind (they weren't that busy btw) and I left.  The second time I went for lunch with a friend, we ordered the fried green tomatoes and burgers...have never had a fried green tomato that had NO flavor before...was hopeful for the burger, but except for the char flavor there wasn't any flavor.  Won't bother going back for food again, not worth the lack of taste and wait when there are better burger places around...even Hardees was better."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service sad for 10 minutes with no one making eye contact several wait staff walking by know and greeted no one made eye contact sitting right at the bar finally ordered a beer that was fine decided to get the pimento cheese fritters very Bland the Tomato GM their idea of flavor was just heat one of the waiters said you need to talk to Phil the manager there and I knew it was a waste of my time anyway just by his attitude but he told me that those will one of the most popular things that they had there and I'm a very small minority and so I just agreed with him and said they were absolutely delicious would never step foot back in Hobo again. Also when I was there just to prove a point one of the customers that was sitting in a booth at the hall right waiter at the top of his lungs two times before they would come to his table so he could leave but I'm sure I'm in the minority I'm sure they treat everybody else with great respect and Rapid service"}
{"text":"We have been twice: once the day after opening around 6pm & this past week during lunch around 1pm

First visit: the wait was only 20 minutes for a table (for a brand new restaurant I thought that was appropriate) but we opted for the last 2 seats at the bar. We ordered the pimento cheese fritters which were awesome! They have a little kick to them but are served with a jam of some kind that pairs nicely!!! 
We both ordered burgers: mine was the one with avocado & I loved it!! I can't remember what the hubby ordered but I think it was fully loaded burger w bacon. We did order them well done & it was cooked to perfection & not too dry. We also had a beer each from the awesome craft selection on tap. The price is awesome: 35$ for all!!!! The staff were really friendly & I really liked the atmosphere.

2nd visit: we opted for a patio seat w our 4 year old son. The waitress was so sweet & very patient & interacted with him. The kitchen was a little behind but we were kept up to date with no problems on refills etc. I had the grown up grilled cheese: a must!!! It's house made pimento, provolone & another type with bacon(yum)!! My husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he really liked. Although we had to wait a while for food (like 35 minutes) it was still a wonderful experience. It was nice that the patio is fenced & our son played in the grassy area while we finished up eating. 

As to the negative reviews so far, please keep in mind that this restaurant is just now a week old! They are doing great in my opinion. And some things are just out of their control (the \"cooks down\"= they were short staffed in the kitchen; the \"kids at the bar\" = it's a family friendly environment; that's kind of being nit picky and in my opinion doesn't warrant a negative review) 
Keep up the good work Hobos!!! We look forward to more visits!!"}
{"text":"My latest visit was this past Friday night. The bar was busy."}
{"text":"If you're in fort mill looking for a good burger this is the place to go. Went there when I was in town for business. Great food."}
{"text":"Just walked out, 45 minuter wait and the bartender/manager wouldn't serve my 16 year old daughter and myself at the bar. We won't be back. Bartender quoted a law that doesn't exist, weak management, hire better people. Hire better people."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good but the buffalo chicken sandwich and the salads are great as well. We eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Love Hobo's. They have the best burgers in Fort Mill and good vegetarian options. Great patio seating and a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"My visit to Hobo's was the result of a spur of the moment trip to Fort Mill. After seeing the limited options of restaurants open on Sunday's in this town, we decided to give it a try despite the mixed reviews. The staff was super friendly, we were greeted before we even walked in the door. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. I went for the chicken and waffle sandwich. Good, but the bacon waffle just had some flakes in it, and it was lacking in the syrup department. Mom got the Mack and Mack (Carolina burger). Cooked perfectly pink in the middle. I strongly suggest the pasta salad as a side if you like flavor. They have an awesome menu, small but unique. Walk up bar on the outside, with a pretty neat patio."}
{"text":"First visit, not bad.   Buffalo shrimp are huge and spicy, enjoyed those, I had the chicken and waffles.  Waffles are a little on the heavy/thick side but were tasty.  Decent beer selection,  and the spike milkshakes were the best part, prices are reasonable.  Will be going again."}
{"text":"First time here, been meaning to try. The service was excellent even though it was busy. The bartender Brittney was awesome and good at suggesting a burger as I was undecisive. I ordered the Islander w chips and ordered a Naked Apple cidar. It was a great eat! Try it!"}
{"text":"food service from kitchen was slow for a Monday night with half empty restaurant. fish sandwich (most expensive sandwich on menu) was very small. even after returning first fish, second version was just as small. luckily there was lettuce and tomato on bun so I had something to chew! fries were cold...twice. No manager visit after these issues."}
{"text":"Great location, remember there is lots of parking in the back. Lighting is a little off as the recessed lighting is flourescent. Also, the sound is loud and echoey. Maybe add some sound proof foam on some spots on the tin ceiling  to help with the echo. The combo gives a cafeteria feel. The doors were open to the patio which was nice, but then there were several flies landing on us during our meal inside the restaurant. They need to add a way to control the flies if they are going to have the doors open. We wanted to eat outside but there is not a lot of shade out there. Tables have umbrellas instead of an awning so shade is hit or miss. 
Now on to the food.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich which is served on a brioche roll. Chicken had a great grill flavor but the roll is too hard and thicker than the chicken. Fries are hand cut but mine were a bunch of small pieces and were greasy and soft. 
My boyfriend had a applewood burger that he said had good flavor, but is served on sourdough toasted bread so it gets smashed  and soggy. My suggestion is swap the bread with the burger and the chicken. Brioche can absorb some of the liquid from the burger and soften is and minimize the drip.
My boyfriend also ordered a pumpkin spice milkshake which was posted on the chalkboard. To our surprise it was alcoholic and $9. Yikes! Not clearly marked and not what we expected for lunch. 
This place has potential, but needs tweaking. Service was good and staff was friendly. Also I think they should add sweet potato fries as a side option with burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries.. Service was very good. The menu is very unique and this place is not your average burger!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this placE!  The.location is perfect and the outdoor patio definitely calls to me! Wonderful place.to relax after a long day!  The food is great!  I highly recommend the pimento fritters, delish!  Loved the atmosphere and super friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed, but to be completely fair the burger I had was tasty and by far the best part of the meal. 

Let me clarify the burger meat was good. The bun was old and not toasted. They get their bread from a local bakery which I frequent. I have had their bread numerous times. This was the most disappointing part of my meal. I know how good the brioche buns are. This one sucked!   

I asked for cheese to be added to my burger... it was not. 

The chili was just plain bad... dry and bad. the little bit of slaw that was on my burger was ok but to be honest it really had no taste there simply wasn't enough of it to tell you if it was good or not. 

The French fries were fairly hot and had a good taste. I have to say it seemed like the end of a batch. lots of small pieces, not very many big fries.

 the beer was good and the bartender friendly although neither of them bothered to engage me in any conversation....

 and the topper of the whole experience.... when I entered at the very beginning of the evening I passed an employee in the hall.... can you guess what she said to me? yep.... absolutely nothing .. I don't know if anyone else feels this way but given the choice I would prefer you to be rude to me rather than be indifferent to me. I think indifference is the worst...."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the location is great! We stopped by the other night and they had music outside. The food is consistent and the beer is cold. They have great wings and burgers. Spiked milk shakes are an added bonus! Only point is because the service can be iffy at times but besides that it's one of our favorite places in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"This place exceeds expectations. The food is delicious, went there last night and had the spicy chicken sandwich. The beer selection is wonderful and the staff is amazing. The older gentleman at the bar really made the experience. If you are looking for good food and a great time this is the place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it is close by, but I was disappointed to say the least. The burger was okay (nothing to write home about), but the fries were greasy and cold. When I reached for the ketchup bottle I found myself wiping some kind of white slime off my fingers.  I asked the waitress for another bottle, but that was obviously difficult as it took 10 minutes to get one. Poor service, mediocre food.  The experience was not worthy of an $11 hamburger."}
{"text":"The burgers are ok, the cheese fritters are awesome, the fries are gross, basically soggy oil."}
{"text":"The fried chicken and bacon waffle sandwich was amazing. Very friendly, welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Too damn slow, over priced and the portions are small. If you go for lunch expect an hour wait to get your meal."}
{"text":"A place that fort mill needs. The burgers offer a variety for everyone and go best with fries and a side of hobo sauce. Big fan of the craft brews, they have 15 taps dedicated just to local nc and sc beers. For desert try the bushwhacker milkshake, spiked with rum so a perfect way to end a good meal. Dog friendly outside and grassy area for kids to play while you wait."}
{"text":"BLT is my personal favorite with fried green tomato, thick piece of bacon!  Fries are very good too!  Great atmosphere for adult night out or take the kids and let them round around in the enclosed yard by the patio. Kids love the shakes and they have a great beer selection for the adults."}
{"text":"Well I hate to give a single star without tasting the food. The reason I am is because I was excited to try the snacks here. My wife and I both called to check independently to see if they were open on Sunday.  It was stated to both of us that yes they were from 11 until. Well we arrived driving through the downpours today excited to sample some food. Guess what they decided that they will be open Sunday's starting in May. Ummmm would have been nice to know when we called Saturday. I will update my review if we happen by there again."}
{"text":"Decent food especially the burgers, nice ambiance but sometimes a little too noisy. Good choice for downtown casual dining. Even the kids enjoy this restaurant. Great deck and a patch of grass area for them to run around while waiting for the food to arrive. They also enjoy wandering across the street to the comic book store. 

Again: Decent prices, decent food, good option for casual dining."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight and was told outside seating was reserved. My wife and I settled on a table inside, waited 15 minutes nobody came over. Multiple waitresses walked right by us, host was a young kid who ignored us after he seated us and could see we weren't being served. Got up after 15 minutes went next store to Local Dish and had an amazing meal and service."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, food is very good and a fun atmosphere. 
My main problem with this place is the way they don't list what they have on tap. The beer menu is laminated and never updated, and I have to walk around to look at all the taps since they don't have an easy way to see all their beers at once, and the server can't tell me every beer they have that's not on the menu. Until they fix this issue I'll drink elsewhere. I brought this problem up to management but no change has been done yet. Step up your beer game, Hobos."}
{"text":"I loved it here! I'm here on vacation but everyone was super nice and attentive! The service was excellent and very quick! The food was amazing! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We found this little gem this past weekend and it's a great place to eat. The burgers were hand pressed and cooked to perfection. The fries are homemade. My daughter had a milkshake and I want to try one of their spiked milkshakes. Great value. Fast service.  Nice ambiance we dined on the patio and watched basketball. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Hey Tega Cay -Steele Creek- Ft Mill. Who cares about good food ! This place is  Ahhhhhh Summm ! Sitting at the bar your inside and outside. Your outside and inside. It's both. The Carolinas need more bars outside on the deck -outside tiki bars whatever. Can't compare to T Bones  on the lake when ya live in Pineville like me. This is Quick n easy. Hobos baby this is the destination In Ft Mill ! Ft mill not Charlotte. It's Carolina weather baby come on Charlotte bars and restaurants !!"}
{"text":"First time here and I had a great experience. Started off by ordering a Long Island Iced Tea. Best one I've had in the area! I then ordered the grouper bites. They were phenomenal!  I could have eaten 2 orders but needed to save room for a burger. I did the build your own cooked med. well and it came out perfectly cooked. My kids ordered milkshakes to go which they said were very good. Service was good. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I guess I would say this new place is OK.  The fish sandwich was good, as well as the fried green tomatoes starter.  Service was good unlike the other reviews.  The outdoor deck is great- We are so happy to have another restaurant in Fort Mill that I hesitate to slam it.  Local Dish is much higher quality food and a more sophisticated menu but it is nice to have something else on Main St.  I think if there were a few more healthy options on the menu it would help.  Overall, it is OK."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed visiting this place for the first time today.  We ordered wings as appetizer and a burger meal each.  I wouldn't recommend that just because it's too much food.    Service was friendly and they even let us taste different types of beer before ordering.     One side note.   I know it's out ofc their control but there were a few flies outside during summertime."}
{"text":"Always great food and people... The burgers are awesome... Try a shake, also great salads..."}
{"text":"I recently visited here for lunch but I've actually dined here a few opened and I'm glad to see that it's still doing well. The parking lot is going to be a tight squeeze especially during peak hours (I actually ended up parking across the street) so you may want to plan accordingly in order to beat the rush. The variety of food on the menu won't overwhelm you but there's certainly a solid section to choose from. The Chicken and Waffle sandwich is certainly worth the price of admission with bacon bits infused into the waffle itself and with maple aioli spread. Do yourself a favor and add a fried egg onto the sandwich along with some extra maple aioli on the side for the ultimate brunch party in your mouth. Sides are the usual fries, chips, etc both tasty and fresh without being standout on their own. There's also a great selection of beers (draft and bottled) and even moonshine which you don't see every day (not my kind of adult beverage however) There's a solid amount of indoor seating as well as patio seating and several TV's to keep up with latest in sports. The staff and the service has always been solid, never any issues with messed up food, slow service, etc. So if you're in the mood for a quality burger\sandwich you certainly can't go wrong hopping into Hobo's :-)"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for burger. When it arrived it didn't even have what I wanted on it. when they gave me the onion straws they were greasy. The fries were horrible. It's a shame because it's a great location to play but the food and the service is just awful I won't go back. We went with a group of six and that was a big mistake.. Too many great burger places I rather go to five guys if I want a fast burger"}
{"text":"We really like Hobo's. We've never had to wait long for a table. Every single visit (6 or 7 total), we've had great service and our food has arrived quickly and as ordered. 

The food itself is really good. I've tried several items and never been disappointed. The last visit, our server even brought my son a little mini milkshake for free. So sweet of her."}
{"text":"Great fast service and the food/Hobo Mules were delicious. The kids destroyed their grilled cheese and cheeseburger. The adults got the BLT and Island Express burger and were great too."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today for the first time with my son. Food was very good and pretty good service. Will be back to sample more."}
{"text":"5 star fresh food daily
Homemade dressings
Burgers ground daily 
Brittany is a great bartender 
Will go back even 45 mins away from me"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in fort mill! It never disappoints and the atmosphere is perfect. I love \"the wanderer\" and the pimento cheese bites are amazing. The only negative is that the sweet tea consistently makes me sick. If I don't get tea everything is perfect!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. We only waited a couple minutes to be seated. The waiter was very nice. I ordered the build your own burger with cheese and lettuce with a side of cole slaw. The burger was a little undercooked but not a huge deal. The cole slaw had a bite to it. Not sure if they added too much pepper or what. Overall I will give Hobo's another shot. But for a $10 meal, I expected better food."}
{"text":"Finally went Sunday 10/15 after reading so many great reviews. Here's another one. Great little joint. Great menu and service. Had the vagabond burger and a couple of Sam's Octoberfests. Less than $20. Lots of tvs. Awesome looking patio I'll try next time   Don't know why anyone would go to some chain place when you can go to a cool place like this. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well I have good news and bad news. I went there the first time last week. I had a black and blue burger which was fantastic. Great bun, generous patty and blue cheese. One of the best I've had. However. The accompanying fries were the worst I've had. They were dark brown (overcooked),and about half the fries were pieces about an inch long or less.  It was like the bottom crumbs of a bag of frozen fries. They would do themselves a favor to do fries another way! I would definitely go back but get a different side beside the fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for lunch a few days ago -- the place was packed but we were seated very quickly.  Service was fast & friendly.  We both tried different burgers and they were delicious!!  and HUGE!!  Be sure and take your appetite.  I had the crispy onion strings with mine - wonderful & lightly breaded. My husband had the shepard's pie for his side as we went around St. Patrick's day.  We wanted to try one of the \"adult\" shakes that had some liqour in it but we were both too full to try - definitely something we save room for on our next visit.  Great place and plan on returning."}
{"text":"Hobo's is a great downtown spot that is well liked by my employer and coworkers.  I have had Hobo's twice now because of their want to order from there or go there for lunch.  I really want to love Hobo's and I think they have potential, but it is just not there for me yet. 

The first time I ordered the grown up grilled cheese with their pasta salad to go.  I would be interested in trying this again, but this was probably my fault for ordering a grilled cheese to go, it is never really that good once you get something to go as the gooey-ness and goodness of a grilled cheese just goes away during travel.  So could this have potential - sure, but it was not good as a to-go option - even after reheat.

The second time was in person and it was the chicken and waffle sandwich.  This was huge - just give me half as an option and I'm good (really because it did awful as reheated leftovers).  I kind of left disappointed with this.  I thought the execution of the chicken and the waffle was good, but it ended up dry as there was just not enough of the maple aioli.  I would almost just prefer that they serve it as chicken and waffles and let me add aioli/syrup as I need.

There look like other great options to try (especially those milkshakes).  I'll probably give it a third try (probably even more knowing my coworkers love the place), but I still need to be won over for me to try it on my own."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!  Love the California burger with fresh avocado and the homemade potato chips are crunchy and good!  Also love the Chicken Tacos, milkshakes and many other types of burgers...all are great.  Staff is friendly and customer service is great.  The ambiance is rustic with exposed brick walls and nice tall wooden booths. My husband likes the craft beer list.  They even had Highland Brewing Company Cold Mountain...a seasonal favorite that sells out quickly! The outdoor patio is fun in the summer, they have live music. Located right on Main Street in Fort Mill...across from my office."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service.  Good selection of craft beers on tap"}
{"text":"While attending open houses on a Saturday afternoon with my family we lost track of time and grew hungry. As we drove we saw the BIG HoBo sign and decided to go check them out after pulling it up on Yelp while parked out back. 
The reviews drew us in and once inside the open floor plan and friendly staffers were great additions. This place has a great open floor plan and the outdoor space was pretty green and had a couple of bags games set up. 
Our server was very attentive and took our order promptly. We ordered the Fries Green Tomato appetizer which is served over grits and topped cowboy caviar. The tomatoes were yummy but the show stopper was tied between the cowboy caviar and the grits both perfect accents.
I ordered the Black Bean Burger:
*It was extremely dry and below basic 
Our son had chicken tenders:
*They appeared ok, however he bit one and didn't eat anymore he only ate the fries and he isn't a fry type of kid. I must add that he doesn't eat meat much either but if it's super yummy he does.
My husband ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich:
*He stated that the Waffle was to doughy. He enjoyed the honey type drizzle on the chicken. Our son even took a bite of his sandwich. My husband didn't finish his food which says a lot.
I was reminded by our server that I mentioned wanting a milk shake and she offered up on in which we allowed my son since they didn't have almond or coconut milk for me (I'm eating Vegan 90% and 10%Vegetarian). He enjoyed a cookie and cream shake that he drank down good and fast.

It was great to check this local place out #EatLocal but I personally wouldn't return unless they revamp the menu and offer more Vegan or Vegetarian options as the current Black Bean Burger was a No No for me as it's tooo DRY."}
{"text":"Awesome, very awesome food! Had a buffalo sandwich loved it. The entertainment was great. Sat out on the porch, great! The waitstaff... Not awesome, I felt like I was at Dick's last resort... I annoyed our server when I asked for anything.."}
{"text":"Excellent food and bar service.  Vagabond burger and grouper bits were awesome.  Bartender Kristen very friendly and a very good selection of beers on tap.  They have outside tables and bar seating."}
{"text":"When I went there, I got the california burger with Tavern chips. The burger was bland and unevenly cooked. The outside was burnt and the inside was way under cooked considered I ordered it medium. The tavern chips were also pretty raw. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and atmosphere, but we were told our food order hadn't been sent to the kitchen after an hour of waiting. Service could have been a little more attentive. We did try the pimento bites and they were great. We will give it another try, but not extremely impressed with our first visit."}
{"text":"ADULT MILKSHAKE. Get an adult milkshake, they'll make your day, night or morning :). They are truly the best thing they have one the menu. Sure the food is good, American food but you must come for the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Best spot in Fort Mill for a delicious burger in a casual family friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good food with a great view of the tracks in downtown Fort Mill. I had the Chicken & Bacon Waffles sandwich and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today and it was my first time eating here.  My wife and I had wanted to try this place, but most of the early reviews said service was very slow.  The restaurant has now been open for several months, so maybe they've ironed out the wrinkles.  My buddy and I sat on the patio, which is one of the biggest appeals for this place.  The patio overlooks a park and the railroad tracks, hence the name \"Hobos.\"  I ordered a root beer float and a Big Apple burger with fries.  The root beer float was served in a mason jar, which was a nice touch.  The fries are fresh cut with the skins still on them, similar to what you get at Five Guys.  The Big Apple burger was excellent.  The burger itself tasted like a burger you'd have at a backyard cookout, which is how I like my burgers.  I'd never had apples as a burger topping, or even thought about them in that way, but it was very tasty and goes well with the bacon.  I'm a big fan of sourdough bread, so bonus for me that this burger is served on it. A train came rumbling through mid-lunch, which was pretty cool, as the tracks are less than 100 yards from the patio. Well, I guess it's cool if you like trains, not so cool if you mind hearing it blast its horn while you're enjoying your meal.  Oh yeah, the service... our waitress was friendly and attentive.  I plan to come back and bring my wife."}
{"text":"Really love this little gem. We came back for the 2nd week in a row. Great live music, food and service. They really have a great refreshing cocktail menu. We had the fried grouper bites. Super fresh and hot. Can't be happier to have an option like this. Well managed and different than anything else in the area. Will be back regularly."}
{"text":"I've Heard Good things about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. The place looked amazing, very cozy so I thought the food would be good as well... I WAS WRONG TERRIBLE FOOD! A Raw Burger With A Burnt Outside, \"A MILKSHAKE\" MORE LIKE A PROTEIN SHAKE WITHOUT THE PROTEIN!, The salad lacked any flavor, imagination and had very little color, and last but not least the fries one of the most simple of all.... AND THEY WERE BURNT TO BLACK. Unless your coming for alcohol I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic. My wife and I have eaten there several times now and have enjoyed the experience.  Nice seating and outdoor area as well. Great beers to choose from. Best burger in the area"}
{"text":"Great place, with great food & beer selection. The kids meals are great for the price. If you have kids the outdoor sitting area does not allow smoking and has a fenced area below for the smokers. I love the black bean burger with the build your own options. The Pimento Cheese fritters are very good. The shakes are as homemade tasting as you can get. The service has improved each time we have visited. A must in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere here, family/pet friendly is key for us. It's so now nice being able to eat outside and let the kids run around without feeling like they are driving other family's crazy. Service was great, food was great and atmosphere was great. This will be a staple for us I'm sure."}
{"text":"Yes. This place. Go. You must. I was in town visiting family and we had dinner here. Drinks are GOOD! Food and atmosphere is top notch and the service was fantastic. 

I got a burger- amazing. Seriously. I'm shocked by its current rating. 5 Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I don't come here often, because there's about a half dozen places within 15 minutes of our house to get a decent burger, but we decided to order 'to go' tonight because this is the closest place. That statement should bring an immediate question to mind \"wait, this is the closest place and he doesn't go here all the time?\" Yep, because our past maybe five experiences have not been great and honestly mediocre at best, which is why I've waited to review and gave such a low score. When I have a mediocre or less experience at a place, I try to spread out my visits before I give a bad review, unless that place just flat-out sucked the first time. And even when that happens, I've given places a second chance. Most of them have failed. So, to be full-disclosure on this review, this is probably the eighth time I've either ordered 'to go', eaten here alone or with my wife, and my wife has also come without me with our daughter one time. Her experience then was \"okay\", according to her and my daughter.

So anyway, my wife and I were tired and wanted something fast and even though I knew Hobo's would be busy (Friday night) and our past experiences were not stellar, I really didn't feel like driving to Rock Hill or somewhere else. My wife wanted a Carolina burger, well-done with no bun (to be eaten as a salad) and chips. I ordered a BYOB, medium-well, with provolone, lettuce tomato and onion. I specified the done-ness of the meat in this review, because that was the most dissatisfying part, by far. I understand that a burger can cook a little past the done-ness you order on the drive home, but both of these burgers were almost briquettes after a less than five minute drive. My wife's was worse than mine. Immediately after her first bite, she said to me \"I'm not complaining, because I'm so hungry right now I'd eat almost anything, but this is by far the most well-done burger I've ever had anywhere\". I was thinking the same thing, because I was just as hungry. I hadn't taken a bite of my burger yet, but I did cut it in half to make it easier to eat while sitting on the sofa and when she said that I picked up a half and realized it was definitely over well-done. I took a bite and there was almost no moisture left in the burger at all. I squeezed the bun and patty to see if any moisture would come out and I barely got it to sweat until I'd made it about a quarter inch thick. I tried, I really really tried to eat more of it and I actually managed to get about four dipped in ketchup-smothered bites down my gullet, but it was just not happening. I'd eaten maybe a quarter of it before I threw in the towel. My wife's chips were not great, as well. Half of them were okay, but the other half (mixed in so randomly, it was hard to tell) were rock-hard and potentially tooth-breaking. It was a tooth Russian-roulette. My onion strings were also a mixed bag. Some were fine, the others were very soggy.

Now, I know there are burger enthusiasts who might read this and say \"who orders a burger medium-well or well-done?\" I can't answer that question other than to raise my hand and say 'right here'. I do understand why maybe you'd want a burger cooked medium or less, but I know I don't prefer it that way and my wife probably stuck with well-done since she went through being pregnant and always ordering everything well done. Not to mention, my wife and I have both ordered burgers ('to go' many times, BTW) the same way from multiple places within that 15 minute radius I mentioned, some probably less than a week ago, and we actually got what we ordered after an even longer drive home. Part of my preference is that I absolutely hate a soggy bottom bun and sometimes when you order a medium or less done-ness, the bottom bun is a red gloppy mess. No thanks.

So, let's call this review frustration for the most part. The few times I've had experiences here where I wouldn't complain happened when I actually ate there at the bar. Almost all of my 'to go' experiences have sucked for one reason or another. Had I taken notes those other times, I would add more insight, but the reasons are similar. There's always a couple different things that are wrong. This experience with \"done-ness\" is not the first time, I can tell you that. Either my burger was fine and my wife's was over or under-cooked or vice-versa on almost every other occasion. This was the first time they absolutely cooked both of ours to oblivion, which is why I wrote this review. Don't read this and think, \"oh this guy just had one bad day and here's his bad review\". No, this is based on multiple experiences. Maybe they just don't have their 'to go' game all together? I suppose that's a possibility. But, being the only burger joint in downtown Fort Mill and the only burger joint within almost two and a half miles of their location (trying not to mention Wing King which isn't even a burger joint, but has a burger on their menu), you'd think they'd have their act together by now."}
{"text":"I love this local dig. Great food, great choice of craft beer, and a great ambiance for both grabbing drinks with the boys or bringing out the family. They keep the place under control and have a few different sections. The outside bar area is awesome, overlooking the downtown park and the train tracks. You'll probably hear the train go by at some point! Great burgers, very tasty! I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This is a burger place with a good selection of draft beer plus other bar favorites. They definitely deliver on the burger and the atmosphere on the deck is awesome.  Will be incredible as the temps get a little cooler. Friendly staff and and good vibe with a little live reggae on the deck. We will be back and this has the potential to be our go to burger place. One note is that an option for a fry with a little less seasoning would keep the kids happy."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with my husband. It was a busy Saturday and we had to wait a half hour, understandable. When we finally did get a table I felt like our table was in the way of everything as it was right near the patio door, bar and foot traffic. We waited and waited and waited and finally got to put in our drink order. We both got milkshakes which were very good but that was the only good thing. I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a chicken sandwich. So there we were waiting and waiting and waiting. It was really ridiculous how long we waited for such a mediocre meal. His meal came out and it took about 15 mins to ever see my meal, the waitress finally realized I was not served. My burger was cold and completely rare on the inside when I had asked for well done. Bad experience I don't see what all the hype is food was just gross Never coming back here so NOT worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by anything. Our waiter was nice, but that's about it. WATCH YOUR TAB. They tried to over charge me for our beer - menu said $3 and they charged $3.25. The manager corrected, but how many people have not noticed?  Surround-sound was very loud at lunch and the food was forgettable. I always try to support local places, but there are other local places I'll go first."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles sandwich, which was awesome. I don't recall what my wife had. The atmosphere was fun, and the wait wasn't too long. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We visit Hobo's frequently and it's yet to disappoint! Friendly staff, killer milkshakes and a dog friendly atmosphere is hard to find!

We've tried a decent portion of the menu from burgers, salads to bbq and everything has always been cooked perfectly and well portioned. They have an excellent beer selection and make a great Grapefruit Mule - although they need new copper mugs! We've always opted to sit on the patio since it's lovely when the weather permits. 

Hobo's is a local joint you definitely don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was nice, but the service was s l o w.  They apologized for the long wait for food, but I don't know what the cause was.   We ordered three black bean burgers and one regular burger.   The black bean burgers were mushy and not very good. The fries were a limp pile of skinny, greasy skinny fries.   The portion of fries was also small. It was edible, but not very good. I really wanted to like this place. It was fun to sit in the enclosed patio and look out at the Christmas lights in Fort Mill, but sadly it didn't make up for the bad food.  Maybe black bean burgers aren't there thing and the limp fries may just be their regular thing,    Oh well, we tried it and won't be going back."}
{"text":"First let me say that I really wanted to like this place. In fact, I went a couple of weeks ago, had a terrible meal, but decided to try it again. Sadly, it has not improved. The good: it has a rather innovative menu, and a wide selection of hamburgers. I mean, a really wide selection of hamburgers. Second, they make home made milk shakes. Third, their appetizers are also innovative. Now, the bad: the service is horrible. I have been there twice, and both times the service is just plain bad. On the first visit, the manager / owner was dressing down two of the servers / hostesses at the front podium, and simply ignored us. I thought, ok, maybe they are just new. Then the server messed up my order, which as it turned out, really didn't matter because the food was simply bland. They have homemade tater tots as an appetizer. Sounds intriguing, but they had no taste. They also have homemade chips ... wow, except they were soggy, and undercooked. I thought well, maybe they were left over from lunch, so I went back for lunch, but same thing. The chips are simply soggy and undercooked. I guess that is their design. The milk shake could have been good, but they cover the top with at least four inches of cheap soapy tasting ready whip (I guess it is cheaper than ice cream and milk) which completely ruins the rather small milk shake in the first place. At four bucks for a milk shake, it is not really all that expensive, but maybe they should up the price to five bucks and serve a decent product instead. I also got the fish filet sandwich ... again it looked good, but was bland and tasteless. When I spend 20 dollars (on just me) for lunch, I expect a better value or experience. By the way, the place is super loud which makes it impossible to hold a conversation with your date, AND because of the open windows to the patio, you constantly get annoyed with flys. So no ambience, poor service, bland food, and an expensive meal really do not go together. If you happen to be downtown in Fort Mill, and are looking for a place to eat, go next door to the Local Dish ... at least their food is edible, AND it will be cheaper to boot."}
{"text":"Excellent spot in downtown Fort Mill. We ate outside, great deck. I had the black bean burger, awesome, really awesome. Others in my party had a grown up grilled cheese, BLT and a burger (The Wanderer), everyone was very happy with their meals. The wait staff was spectacular, above expectations. Great to have this place in Fort Mill, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I can't. The food is unimaginative and not that tasty. I think everything on the menu is fried? If not, it may as well be thrown in the fryer too. But the worst part is they hired a certain server who always has a scowl on his face... It's not resting bitch face either, honey."}
{"text":"Food was good and the bar is a great addition to Fort Mill. Maybe once the buzz dies down the service can catch up to the demand. Waited nearly 2 hours to be seated but we did have a large group on a Saturday night. Friendly staff and heat beer selection. Glad to see a little life brought to downtown Fort mill."}
{"text":"Always drove by this place and always looked like fun.  Finally decided to try for lunch and it was well worth it.  Great menu and big burgers with dirty fries, very tasty.  They also have a nice drink menu from spiked milk shakes to an assortment of IPA'S to choose from on 13 revolving taps.  Also a good place to watch a sporting event.  I will have to try happy hour eventually."}
{"text":"I've been by Hobo's many times but decided to give it a try for dinner tonight. It was really good! The burger was flavorful, fries were abundant, and the milkshake (although a bit thin for my taste) was a nice sweet treat! The portion sizes were good for the price. Don't eat a whole burger if you can't nap afterwards. 
Our waitress was friendly and I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried this today for the first time and we won't be back.  We started with Boxcar Taters.  Not at all what I expected, more of a potato croquette than a tater tot, hubby liked them, me and my daughter didn't.  Then burgers, Hubby had the Mack and Mack, I had the Vagabond.  Both burgers were really, really dry, (even mine cooked medium, was a beautiful pink and yet somehow still horribly dry) the chili was even exceptionally dry - and no flavor to be found anywhere other than - to be fair - a really nice char flavor on the burger patty itself.  The food looked good, the bun and burger itself was beautiful, but it just wasn't - I had 4 or so glasses of water just trying to get it down.  Had we not been ravenously hungry we'd have totally sent them back.  The highlight believe it or not was the kids chicken tenders which may in fact be the best chicken tenders either of us have ever had (and of course our daughter hated them) so we left the dry burgers and very very overlooked (brown!) fries and split the leftovers from our kids meal.  Those chicken tenders are the only reason I don't resent the one star I gave, because without them I wouldn't have even given the one.  We eat out a lot and this was truly terrible food, I have no idea how it's been so highly rated by others, I can only guess their *brews* must be on point because their burger game was perhaps the worst we've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for 6 months. Boy was I wrong for waiting. The Carolina burger is amazing"}
{"text":"Visited mid-day on a Sunday and sat at the bar. Service was fast and the place wasn't overly packed. The windows were open from the patio so the whole restaurant had a nice airy feel to it. The menu offers a variety of modifiable items and drinks. Service was prompt, yet not overbearing. My burger was probably one of the best I've had in a long time. A must for a casual lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Chili Cheese fries, fried banana peppers, phenomenal burger selection, tons of local beers on draft, and a helpful staff. First time here, but I'll be coming back. I have to try the T Money!  Burger in between two grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a casual lunch or dinner. We had the fried grouper bites and the big apple burger, and both were tasty. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. Lovely stop on this cute street in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 5pm, so not incredibly busy. The hostess and waitress were very nice. The food portions were huge (we had burgers)!  Food didn't take long to get to the table at all."}
{"text":"Hobo's has a great atmosphere to it. Nice restaurant in downtown Fort Mill. Food is really good and pricing is not too bad. We have gone a few times"}
{"text":"I guess being here in the area for close to 6 months we have become \"regulars\" here. As always- spot on beer selection and the. Urges and fries are to die for. Always have fries with Hobo sauce, so good! My boys love the wings and chili fries. But how can you say no to a medium burger with pimento!!????  Def. my favorite burger place since moving from California"}
{"text":"This is one our favorite local spots. The place is small so sometimes there is a wait but the food makes up for it. When the restaurant is full, it is quite loud but that is to be expected in such a small building. Our favorite dishes are the grouper bites appetizer and the cobb salad as our entree. We always get the same things now because they are so good. The rum runners are pretty delicious as well
When the weather allows it, the seating outside is wonderful. There is a great view of Fort Mill and Confederate park."}
{"text":"I like the place! The build-your-own-burger was great when I asked for it to be medium cooked and it tasted perfect!"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan.....as the Yelp description of five starts says.
This place is as good as it comes, y'all, for casual dining.
The location is superb - downtown Fort Mill.  The price is EXCELLENT!  Most items under $10.  The atmosphere was inviting.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, large screen TVs, a play area for the kiddos, and are next door to a beautiful gazebo in town.  It's just all in all a very inviting and pleasant experience.  Did I mention the prices are low?  Yes, that was one of the best parts of our experience.
We went with a group of middle school kids this past Friday night.  They were dressed for their school formal and we, the parents, stayed for dinner and then took them to the dance from there.  We all seemed to have a great time on the veranda.  The staff was accommodating and the food tasted and looked very fresh and scrumptious.  
WE WILL BE BACK, HOBOS!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger with fries. I ordered the burger medium rare. It was extremely dry and quite bland. Boyfriend had the chicken and waffles which he said was pretty good. Overall mediocre."}
{"text":"Fort Mill has always needed a place like Hobo's. For a local hangout spot, it's convenient to old town but doesn't close out some of the newbies. I'm one of the lucky few who is within walking distance (for some :)). 
The menu offers enough variety to cover a few palates but not too much to become overwhelming. Service is hit or miss but for a small place hosting a big crowd, they do okay. 
I love that they will invite local artists from time to time. That really shows the town they are willing to support our growing community. 
The police station is hardly a skip or hop away so generally, there isn't an overly rowdy crowd. The staff handles potential situations well, too. 
I'll personally, always miss Tony's Pizza and the Elvis impersonator; but Hobo's does a good job of filling in a much needed local restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good burgers, cold drinks, comfortable casual atmosphere. It's a good place to take just about anybody. They even have a couple vegetarian options. The only downside is often when I come here the relaxed atmosphere often leads parents to go slack on their parenting so the often let their children run wild around the dining area and on the green adjacent to the restaurant, also this restaurant / bar closes a little too early for my liking. However, those small details are trivial. The restaurant as a whole is solid and a welcome addition to a sleepy downtown area."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on our most recent visit to Hobo's. The service was great despite how busy it was. The burgers and sides were amazing - probably the best burgers in Fort Mill. They use buns for Breadsmith which is awesome. Good beer specials and the beer wasn't flat this time."}
{"text":"I was quite happy to see a craft beer oriented place open up downtown Fort Mill. I have been there a couple of times and have had varying experiences. 

The food has been inconsistent at best; I have had burgers be cooked perfectly, burgers be way overcooked, and burgers be next to raw... hard to judge a place when they are all over the board.

The service has not been much of an issue, while the servers have been slow, they have been quite friendly and apologetic for the kitchens mistakes.

The beer menu is actually quite good, and represents a wide variety of styles. The beers seem to be served at a decent temperature and not in frozen glasses (one of my pet peeves).

Overall, I think that once they iron out the inconsistencies in the kitchen and get the staff to pick up the pace a bit, this diamond in the rough could really shine..."}
{"text":"So many of my friends have told me this is the best burgers in Fort mill. I finally went to try it. The burger was tasteless the fries were OK and the staff was slow. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I LOVE Hobo's. I took my friend here for dinner when she was in town. We ate outside and listened to the live music. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The chicken sandwich and black bean burger were delicious! Plus we enjoyed a few margaritas! I plan to get a milkshake next time."}
{"text":"I've tried a number of times to really like Hobo's.  It's a great atmosphere, their beer selection is great.  The fries/other sides are good.  But at the end of the day, their entrees are just so-so.  I went in last night and ordered a burger medium-rare.  It came out cooked perfectly.  However, it was just still so dry.  The rolls, while delicious, are too big for the size of the patty.  My wife ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it had the same issue.  Too much bread for not enough meat and what meat was there was not juicy.  They get the rolls from Breadsmith...the rolls are delicious, don't get me wrong, they just are too big for the patty.

My kids love it, so we will go there occasionally, but I have to keep searching for something I like on the menu."}
{"text":"So it seems this is typical, a business opens works hard to treat customers well and then it gradually dies off. 
Visited Hobos in 3/31, our party of 4 sat at the bar, after 20 minutes the unpleasant bar tender who we obviously bothering asked if we would be eating at the bar, um yes I hope so, she huffs off and comes back minutes later, yah we are finally \"allowed\" to order a drink, I guess she didn't realize 40% head on a beer isn't how it's supposed to be poured although this big girl was not someone I would want to say anything about.  
Order a burger, the same $12 burger I raved about previously, looooong wait to get it, really expected it to be as good as it was in the past, big let down, the 3 of us who ordered burgers all received COLD food, the burger was cold as well as the sides, not even a little cold, it's obvious they sat in the back (and not even under a heat lamp). 
Feels to me like the management has decided to sit back and let the employees run the show, this is probably why so many restaurants fail, grab a hold of the rains Mrs Hobo, if you don't pull back hard and dig in I can't see you lasting long. 
When you opened to now your competition has increased 10 fold!"}
{"text":"Great little burger joint with an outdoor patio and an breezewat walk up bar. Very nice touch. The decor is outstanding. It really captures the old Mainstream history, while maintaining modern clean lines; lots of brick on the wall, railroad bar kickstands, and railroad anchors to hang your coats on.  All new from the looks of it, so no allergens. It's beautiful.  

The food is very good. We started with giant homemade tater tots that we filled with gooey cheese. I got 1.5 pieces.  I was robbed. :)  I'm not sure how many were there to start, but I'm sure my husband ate more than two. I would say order two baskets. They are good!

I had a black bean burger. It came with avacado and sprout people! Sprouts. It was as big as my head. Gid had a double patty with cheese and bacon he had to walk away from. He couldn't finish it.

 Everything was very good. My one complaint was my veggie burger could have been a little thinner or spicier.  It was a little bland, but the consistency of my burger was good and homemade. Usually veggie burgers are a kiss of death next to the word homemade. This was not. Next time I will order it  with extra avacado and some hot sauce on the side. That should do the trick for a perfect meal. 2 big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time at Hobos and I have to say we really enjoyed it! Where else can I get a burger with grilled cheese buns? We went on Monday evening around 5pm and it was quiet and there was plenty of seating. The server was polite and friendly. The fried green tomatoes were good but the breading was pretty bland. The grits made up for that and the corn salsa was excellent."}
{"text":"Nice burger joint where you can build your own with  plenty of variety brews on tap (got to try those some day after work). Friendly, attentive service at a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went there on a weeknight in July, had about a 20 minute wait.  The hostess was very friendly. The burgers were awesome, service was fast. When I am back in FM I will probably go back.  Wish they had more tables inside."}
{"text":"Love Fort Mills new spot.  Great burgers and a killer beer list.  Now they have added live music as well.  Nice patio to with a bar that goes to inside."}
{"text":"I came here with the family for first time, and we loved everything about this place. My Waitresse was awesome and very friendly. The food was great ! My son had the kid's cheese burger with chips and my daughter had chicken fingers with  French fries. Them French fries are so good ! Chicken fingers was flavorful ! I had the T money burger medium rare and it was amazing. They have outside patio as well I'm definitely coming back often to try the other burgers on menu !"}
{"text":"Their burgers are absolutely superb - cooked just like I like them - pink and juicy in the middle! And they are HUGE!! And think they're half-pound!! And their onion rings are onion straws and so yummy!! My sister got the pulled pork sandwich, and she said it was tasty! My sister and I went on a weekday for lunch, and it was pretty empty. But I went for lunch with my kids on a Saturday, and expect a wait. But not too bad, and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"First off who puts the employees at a table by the front door to eat and roll silverware? Perfectly good table in the back corner. The cheese fritters were really good (hard to mess up fried cheese). Burgers took forever and were dry. I really didn't need to know if so and so was clocked in or not and the manager or owner \"managing\" in front of customers. Bar business might do well. If they make it to football season Sunday business might keep them open. Waitstaff was friendly."}
{"text":"1st time there. Will return, good burgers. Great service. Cold beer, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"I will say, the food was absolutely amazing. Me and my girlfriend went a few months back. One of the best burger places in town taste wise. Sadly, its not the food that will stop us from coming back again. It was the environment , i am in an inter-racial relationship. And me and my girlfriend wete extremely uncomfortable. Many of the employees were nice. But the surrounding patrons and some staff proceeded to stare at us multiple times. One person at the bar wpuld go out his way an stare at us.  Not good when some staff and regulars make you feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Thank you Jill C.,at Hobos, for acknowledging my original post (below). Because of your response, I decided to try again...

Although, many of the beers were out of stock, my friends and I, had a very pleasurable experience. The wings were great and the pimento cheese fritters were phenomenal. 

The waitresses had a great attitude - big contrast from my previous experience.
Changed rating from 2 to 4 stars.
----------------------

I was really wanting to like this place. I wanted to call it my new place to enjoy beer and burgers after a round of golf at Fort Mill Golf Club.... Umm, not so much. While the burger (California) was cooked to my liking and the beer (NoDa Jam Session) went down smoothly, I couldn't help but notice something just didn't feel right. The decor is ho-hum and drab despite the exposed brick and large bar bays for outside service. Maybe it was the misaligned TVs that were oddly positioned above our heads or maybe it was the cheap linoleum that covered the floor. Maybe a combination-
It just feel right to me. 

Now, on to my biggest disappointment- the staff. I was really wanting to contradict the previous post about the subpar waitstaff, but instead I'm fueling the negative sentiments. Here it goes... My wife ordered a  house Pinot Grigio, let's just say, she expected it to taste a little better- it was poor. She politely asked if she could have something else (a Chardonnay almost twice the price as the Pinot). The waitress kindly took the Pinot and brought her the higher-priced Chardonnay. That's where the politeness came to an abrupt end. When she brought the check it included both glasses of wine. I asked why we were being charged for the glass that we sent back and the waitress snapped back, \"Well she ordered it didn't she!\" I asked her if she could speak to the manager to remove it and she stormed off. About 7 minutes later she returned with the comment, \"The manager said she will do it, this one time!\"
I couldn't believe it.  On the way out the waitresses were huddled in the corner and my wife and I heard our waitress say - \"I can't believe they wanted us not to charge them for something they ordered!\"  A few snickers and staring eyes lingered until I, my wife and four year old left."}
{"text":"Hobo's is one of my friend's favorite go-to dinner spots, when we were in town she took us on over for dinner. She raved about the kids area which seems like it's an awesome chance for parents to grab a drink while they wait for a table and let their kids run around and tire themselves out without interrupting anyone's dinner. Major points for that setup. We sat outside and it did get fairly chilly, we asked to turn the heaters on but unfortunately they told us they weren't working. That seemed a bit odd, but we got over it. The alcoholic milkshakes were a big hit of the table! I got to taste a few and they were all quite tasty. For dinner I went with the fried fish sandwich. It was flavorful, but it fell apart and became a hot mess in my hands. I basically ate it with a fork because the sandwich method was not working  out. The majority of our table got burgers and everyone enjoyed them! Overall I can see why this is a favorite among Fort Mill families, especially when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"My first intro to Hobo's was during the Friday Main Street event, they had a long wait time so we ordered food from their truck. They offered three things that night, brisket sandwich, quesadillas and one other item, which escapes me at the moment. I do recall LOVING the quesadilla, I think it was the sauce on it that made it so yummy. 

That experience led me to bringing some out of town guests to the restaurant. I was so looking forward to having that quesadilla again but turns out it wasn't on the restaurant menu. 

They are known for their burgers, I had the Mack and Mack, with onion strings. Burger was gigantic, I could only eat half. I enjoyed it but really enjoyed the onion strings.

Everyone enjoyed their meal and agreed we'd all go back."}
{"text":"I just left this place at 3:50 on Monday, March 12. Our waitress did not give us napkins, our waitress did not check on us after she gave us our food to see if everything was all right, hope my grilled cheese I ordered was cold, all the condiments on the table were empty, and they weren't busy at all, there were about 4 or 5 people in the place including me. Somehow it took 35 minutes for me to get my food. I've never received such poor experience somewhere before. Will never be going back there."}
{"text":"Based on all the reviews, we were a little scared about trying Hobo's, but either we hit an off night (which would be a good thing) or they've finally settled into things. 

The fella and I got here around 5:30 on a Friday night thinking we'd beat the crowd, but we were wrong. Although there's a nice patio outside, it was blazing hot, so everyone was inside... mostly crowded around the bar. The inside is laid out a little oddly with the bar and a few massive booths taking up a good bit of space; there are 5 or 6 tables are near the front, which can also be awkward if there's a wait since people are literally waiting right next to your table.

We put our names on the wait list, grabbed a drink at the bar, and got called to sit right as we got our drinks. Thankfully, we got a table not near the waiting people. We both got burgers, which were pretty delicious, and our waitress was attentive and pleasant.

The fella's already been back for lunch and had a good experience, so we'll definitely be back for dinner and hope the good times continue!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We aren't sure why we hadn't stopped in sooner! Wow, the food was great! (And we finally had a sunny day, where we could enjoy the patio!). Their daily drink specials are fantastic, as well.
My husband had the pork sandwich, which was quite good.. But the burger that I had was even better (I had the Sunrise burger), next time he thinks he will stick with a burger! (The pork sandwich was good, but the burger really was a step above).
Our server was friendly, and the food came out at a perfectly reasonable time. The service was only slightly slow, BUT that was only because we went at a slightly off lunch hour time, and our server was the ONLY one that was there at the time, and was bar tending as well - so there is NO hit on that regarding the stars or my review.
I look forward to coming back to enjoy the patio and food!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!  Love me some good burgers and cobb salad here! I have yet to try more."}
{"text":"Writing this on behalf of some family members who were here the night of the Strawberry Festival there in Fort Mill. To my understanding, a waitress stated \"We serve our onion rings room temperature.\" Well, I happen to be a nursing major and understand the implications of that policy. With that being said, I am not too keen on the FDA standards specifically, however I do feel like that is not the best thing to do, as many people could get sick by sticking with that policy. This matter should be taken into consideration, and I'm concerned for the customers and that is why I am writing this. I would just appreciate someone to look into this. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has really good burger patties. i can't recommend the burger as a whole because I don't love their buns or toppings, but the patty itself is thick and has a great char. They also have a decent Bloody Mary.

Everything else that we've tried (I've been through most of the menu) is just okay. The flavors are good, but the dishes could use a little love. They get the burger patties right though. I usually stop in a couple of times a month just for that. Overall, worth a visit if you're in the downtown Fort Mill area."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill somewhat. I've visited many times before and always left satisfied. This visit was not up to par. The fries were greasy and too salty. The burgers were not cooked to the preference we requested.  The food arrived lukewarm and just overall blah. 5Guys burgers is better than what we were just served. Service was great, but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"It's Toro Thursday, so a hankering for beef and great Yelp reviews led my nose here. What a wonderful place to indulge a burger craving! Lots of craft beer, a variety of seating (bar, booth, high tops and al fresco), a band in the background, and several screens for the sports fans among us (go Cubbies). Nice crowd for a Thursday -- excellent sign! We decided to sit at the bar (beware, the HVAC ducts overhead may drip a little if it's as humid as it was tonight). Very attentive, friendly staff made us feel welcome and made our experience extra special. There is a great casual menu featuring burgers -- and they were awesome! Lots of craft beers on tap and milkshakes -- including some spiked varieties which were probably a meal by themselves. A family strolled in and ordered a bunch of milkshakes to go while we sat at the bar perusing the menu. I immediately zeroed in on the Islander, a massive, tender, perfectly prepared medium burger with grilled pineapple and teriyaki with golden-brown fries. My husband got the medium Mac & Mac sans slaw, same fries. Within 10 minutes, our burgers were before us. So delicious, such great banter with the staff, and we are thinking about making this a Toro Thursday staple. You should, too!"}
{"text":"I got to eat here during lunch on a Saturday. The food was above average, but the service at the bar was 5 star, hence the 4 star rating. Had the Vagabond burger and wings for an appetizer. Burger was decent, wings could have been more flavorful but were good. Fries were great. The bartenders were top notch and poured strong mixed drinks. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  Love the selection of local beers on tap... my only real feedback is the food comes out too fast!  I ordered the fried grouper sandwich once and the last bite had a scale in it (at least it was fresh!) and the Vagabond Burger was great however I though the patty lacked the necessary seasoning.  The fried pimento fritters are an absolute must!  Avoid the cole slaw though, really bland and boring.  This is now our go to spot for my wife and I when we have a date night.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Service was good, fun atmosphere. Hubby had burger with grilled cheese sandwich buns and fries. He's picky and he likes it. I had the Asian salad with shrimp also fabulous. We came here from Charlotte to shop and the place was closed. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Good service, friendly staff...grouper bites were good, good wings (small) and good burger..great location, nice outdoor seating...."}
{"text":"From drinks to shakes to apps and the main course, everything was on point. The spiked milkshakes are a MUST. It has the perfect amount of alcohol without drowning in it. The buffalo shrimp was the perfect appetizer. The shrimp were huge! The best part was the chicken and waffles sandwich. This was my first one ever in my life and it exceeded every expectation I had. The service was great, too! Our waitress was beyond nice and gave us time to choose what we wanted without being overly attached. She has the perfect timing thing down pat. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"This place became an instant favorite! I knew as soon as we walked in that it was the perfect atmosphere for our family. We have two young kids who can be loud and embarrassing at times at restaurants and this was the place for them. We ate outside and the kids could run in the fenced grassy area. The service was quick and very friendly. The menu is unique and everything we ordered was delicious. The fried banana peppers is a must try. We didn't get a spiked milkshake, but will try that next time. The drink menu was good and the burgers were great. Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent local Burger and Beer place in Ft Mill. I had the vagabound burger -bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion and Pimento Cheese spread.  Phenomenal!  Washed it down with a couple of local craft beers and I am in my happy place."}
{"text":"OMG, don't go here if you are looking to behave! The tator tots were awesome! Of course we had to try a spiked milkshake. I had the buttery nipple and he tried the thin mint, delicious and sinful!!! I also ordered the pork bbq sandwich with the house bbq sauce. The pork melts in your mouth. You can bet that we will be back whenever we make it to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Best burger in fort mill. Excellent, big, juicy burgers. The buns taste like homemade brioche. Service is great. The milkshakes are divine. The salad is excellent. A must down!"}
{"text":"The BEST Burger you will EVER eat!!
Ingredients are always fresh and the food simply delicious!!
Huge fan of the diversity of beers on tap, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles, their salads are amazing, and the milk shakes taste like your grandmother used to make.
Did I mention their burgers!!? LoL
Go treat yourself to a great meal and bring your kids and friends.  
Great atmosphere for everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Although the sauce for the fried pimento was too sweet, completely overpowered the cheese. The tater tots are not what you thing but totally worth it! Most of us had burgers and all were perfectly as we asked. It's had to find a good medium rare anymore. Chicken tacos were tasty and fries are nice and crispy. Only reason this review is not getting a higher score is the service. While a Saturday night with a small wait, it took over 6 min to have a server visit to take drink orders. She was more interested in socializing with a table that knew her than refilling our drinks or brining is our check and a to-go box. After 10 min of waiting for our check we finally followed her to the server station at the bar to pay and get the box. Hope you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"We liked the creative menu but the actual food was only okay. Overpriced milkshake for size--more milk than shake. Buns for burgers are too big and fall apart. Good fries. Waiter was friendly but missed our appetizer order and still charged us for it. He fixed the bill quickly. Overall good concept but food falls short. They have a full bar, which was busy, but we didn't have any drinks so can't comment on that. Won't rush back here."}
{"text":"Hobo's is a fantastic food and beverage joint that has a modern twist on many of your favorite classic Americana dishes.  It also has a decent selection of draft and bottled brews that will satisfy the most discriminating  craft beer aficionados.

We've been here a dozen times of more and have always enjoyed ourselves.  The atmosphere is lively and family friendly with a nice amount of seating inside and out. We prefer the outside area when it's open, but the inside is just as enjoyable. The bar area serves  both sides when the rollup windows are employed.  

I'd say the value you get for the price is exceptional and there is usually seating even during the crowded times. A few more places to sit inside might make it a bit more cozy, but it works and the kitchen and wait staff seem to be able to keep up with the service even at peek times.

And by the way.  The house chips are to die for."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Fort Mill and I have been here twice this summer.  The burgers are excellent and are paired with a choice of sides in addition to the standard chips & fries.  The pasta salad is great and always tastes fresh.  You have to try the fried green tomatoes for starters.  Solid beer selection and who doesn't want to try an adult milkshake with a great burger!  My favorite so far is the Islander Express burger which is topped with grilled pineapple and a nice light teriyaki sauce that doesn't overpower the burger.  My kids enjoyed their meals and of course had to have a milkshake!!

Outdoor patio is great although it can be warm on a summer evening since it is west facing.  Some ceiling fans and an extended awning would greatly help this, but is only a minor complaint.  They are currently closed on Sundays but we were told will be open once football season kicks off.  Service is great and always seems to be efficient, expect a wait-time on Friday and Saturday for dinner.

I suggest you get out and try this place, it is one of my new favorites and go-to places in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"First timers.  Best burger I've had in a lonnnng time!  It was huge and tasted like home cooked. Bartenders were great too. Decent craft beer selection for Fort Mill.  Outside high top chairs were uncomfortable but food was excellent!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A little messy and disheveled but the food was great and the live music on the patio was good. Fun vibe with friends."}
{"text":"I know this place has only been open a week, and they have some kinks to iron out, but there's something really disturbingly wrong about places with bars that allow children (we're talking toddlers) to sit at the bar. Maybe it's a southern thing and I just don't understand 'the rules'. But heck, out of 20 people at the bar, at one point, four of them were under 10 yrs old.  However, I still think the place has a lot of potential.  Good beer selection and creative menu choices, but they really need to re-think their concept of serving milkshakes and spiked ice cream cocktails until they can streamline their process. They are so time-consuming to make, it puts the bartenders behind.  I would have given the place one star (super-slow service and drink refills, below average food presentation, and too many kids at the bar), but I know they're new and after the buzz dies off, they'll be a good fit for a growing Fort Mill area. I wish I could come back in a few months to give them another try, but we're leaving the area due to a job relo. Bottom line:  The staff is very friendly, and that will take them far."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful... the food is fabulous and the service was great.. fort mill is so lucky to have a place like this and need more... the owners came by and checked on the tables periodically, they are very involved and I will definitely be back :)..."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  I had a very tasty burger here with a great beer and specialty milk shakes selection.   Also a nice place to watch a sporting event or hang out outside with the heaters."}
{"text":"Shabby, but definitely not chic. Basic and bland, from the interiors to menu selection."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Waiting 2hours just for the food, also saw our server only two or three times, the manager had to refill out beverages and get our check for us. The food was outstanding but our server was too busy chatting with friends."}
{"text":"Burger was GOOD! The service was fabulous and love the style of this place....  Can't wait to try the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend when we moved to the area. I love the cute little downtown area that surrounds this restaurant! I have taken family here and my husband and I love going. When it's warm they have an outside sitting area which is dog friendly! Food wise: the burgers are great, I love the fries, and the pimento cheese balls are my favorite! They have a great list of local beers. We ate there last weekend and I wanted to try one their \"famous\" alcohol milkshakes. I ordered the 'honey nut cheerio' milkshake. I've heard people rave about these, but mine wasn't very good. It was actually more like an ice cream float. It probably would've been okay if it was blended together better. Over all it's a great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"The chips were beyond salty. The fries were soggy. All I kept seeing is managers and employees standing at the end of the counter talking and pointing at customers. I did not feel welcome at all. Then I heard how this place is run and couldn't believe it. This place had so much potential, but the owner, owner's wife, and the managers that come in drunk or hungover is just sad. Do not support this place. They treat certain employees like crap. I will never go back there again after the stories I heard."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first time was really good we were all very satisfied with our meals. The price point for what you get is great. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We went back a second time with my mother-in-law in our experience wasn't as great. My husband and I both had burgers as we did the first time, but this time they seemed really dry overcooked and not very flavorful. My mother-in-law had the fish sandwich. The next day all three of us were very very sick. It was unfortunate that our two experiences were so different. Not sure if we'll be back after our last experience."}
{"text":"Pros - excellent location, very nice decor, awesome deck and bar area.
Cons - poor service (slow), Food is not good at all, extremely long wait times, terrible management
I actually went back after a really bad experience and sadly, I will not be back ever again.  Initially it was several weeks into opening and they needed to work out some kinks but nothing has been solved.
The burger I ordered was overcooked and really greasy.  (Over cooked means beyond WELL-DONE) and I asked them for a medium burger.  It took 58 minutes to receive my order after waiting 12 min to place the order.  
I am not sure why this person/people think they should be in this business but they should really find something else to do."}
{"text":"You had me at Pimento cheese fritters. These are heavenly little morsels of yummy cheese fried to perfection and are just waiting to melt in your mouth. I hate having to share them with my husband ;)

I had The Wanderer burger and it was so good. The brioche bun is so fresh and the bbq sauce was the perfect amount of sweet.

Our server was super nice as my husband and I were sweeping up the bread crumbs that our daughter had spilled on the patio and she told us to not worry about it and she would clean it up. She was quick to refill drinks and made sure we were taken care of. 

I am so excited for Hobos to be in downtown Ft Mill. We are taking my parents who live out of town there tonight!! Our family loves supporting our local restaurants and we are excited to have Hobos be a part of the mix!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the world famous Strawberry Festival in Fort Mill and while I'm a big fan of fried oreos we decided to walk over to Hobo's for lunch.  We've never been but I've heard good things.
It was 2:00 pm on a Saturday and there was about a 20 minute wait, the patio was packed and there were a few tables and booths open when we walked in from the back which always bugs me.  The 20 minute wait with open tables means you are understaffed and the 16 year old running the host stand is untrained.  
Anyhoo, we were seated inside in a nice booth.  
Sweetie ordered the fried grouper sandwich and the kiddos had a cheese quesadilla and a cobb salad.  I had a burger.  Burger selection on the menu was AMAZING and the burger I had was excellent, not sure which one it was but it was a preselected one vs. the build your own.  It had onion straws, bacon, American Cheese, onions etc....the patty itself was char grilled and cooked to my taste of med rare (The way God intended a burger be cooked).  If you're here, get a burger you can thank me in the comments.
My kid's Cobb Salad was also well stocked with grilled chicken and all the accompaniments. The Ranch dressing was homemade and lacked that tang you expect but all in all it was good.  Sweetie loved the grouper sandwich and was appreciative of a pescatarian option on the menu.
At the end of the day, I liked Hobo's.  They have a nice selection and I appreciate a place that can make a burger interesting.  I'll be back, and I would guess that on a normal day for lunch they have it better together on the greeting front."}
{"text":"I occasionally pet-sit for a family in Fort Mill, and stop in to Hobo's for lunch every now and again.

I've had their black bean burger, make-your-own chicken sandwich, and the grouper bites as an appetizer. The black bean burger was spicy! I have a low threshold for spice but it definitely had a little kick to it. Otherwise, kind of bland tasting but not bad. The chicken sandwich was blackened nicely and I get it with guacamole and bacon. The guacamole must be the packaged, pre-made kind; it's not bad but I could take it or leave it. The group bites are delicious! The fish is fresh and the tartar sauce is really tasty. I've had their fries and slaw as my sides; both are good. 

The service is fast and friendly, and the food is good enough. I like that it is on the \"sleepier\" side of town away from heavy traffic. I don't know that I would go out of my way to eat here but it's a nice little spot in the downtown part of Fort Mill and I'm glad to have it as an option when I am down that way."}
{"text":"Went to Hobos for lunch on a busy Saturday.  There was a 20 minute wait for a table indoors, but we were able to be seated immediately at the bar so we went with that.  I got the Carolina Classic burger with fries; my friend opted for the Black & Bleu burger with onion straws, although she substituted a Portobello mushroom for the beef.  We both LOVED our burgers - my beef, ordered medium, was perfectly cooked with a warm red center.  I did not care for the look of the french fries - dark brown and greasy looking.  I mentioned this to the gentleman who delivered our orders, and he immediately replaced them with another side of my choice.  I went with the onion straws, which were delicious.  The sweet tea was excellent.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is the shit! Food is always great, served in a timely manner and the serving staff is pretty good.
I bring my dog every time I come and they always get him water, they even have dog bowls for it!"}
{"text":"Coworker and I are here for lunch yesterday being in town for business! 

Stopped in and were immediately welcomed by very friendly staff! The sunrise burger I had was amazing and a lot of bang for your buck. Our server Katie B was fantastic and the entire experience was great for a midday break.

Had a HUGE beer selection also. Would highly recommend to anyone else in the area. Bravo, Hobos."}
{"text":"Excellent! - Hobo's burgers are the best! They are mouth-watering, savory goodness. I've gone many times and I've tried many of the burgers on the menu. Some, I would say are too much to handle, but there really is a burger on their menu for everyone. 

If you're undecided, trust me, this won't disappoint. Always order a burger and fries, this is what they are good at, I'd also get a side of their homemade ranch. It's not the healthiest choice, but again we're talking about a burger shop, and if this is what you're looking for, they some of the best burgers around. I can vouch for medium-rare, it's worth it.

Overall, great place, they have a nice outside patio where you can eat with a group of friends. The only concern I've had on multiple occasions was bees around the patio but outdoors is just an optional section."}
{"text":"Found Hobo's on Yelp and was not disappointed. We went for lunch, and everything was delicious. We started with the pimento cheese fritters, which were amazing on their own, but the tomato jam.. that's where the money is. I would have gladly ordered it as my drink! Hubs got the Grown Up Grilled Cheese with chips (house made) and I got the Chicken and Waffle Sandwich with hand-cut fries. So good, and we'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Went for a weekend lunch, beautiful day for eating on the covered deck. The service was excellent, good tea and very interesting drink menu. The reason for the visit, and their claim to fame the simple hamburger, was in short disappointing. The hamburger, specifically the sunrise burger, was a well portioned beef patty, topped with egg, bacon, pickles, etc, should have been a home run in terms if burgers, beautiful presentation, by anyone's standards. However the medium burger was as dry as toast, not one bit juicy, not a drop. Now some would say, \"hey that's healthier, less fat\", to them I say, \" shut ya mouth, if I want healthy I would have ordered a salad\", I came to eat a sloppy, juicy hamburger. If it were not for the service it would have been a 2 star, great location, great service, not so much to say positive concerning the hamburger."}
{"text":"If your looking for good casual food with a great outdoor setting this is the place to go! They have the best Cobb salad ever and their specialty drinks are awesome! They serve them in mason jars for that southern feel! They have grass right next to the tables so the kiddos can play, it's just a great atmosphere all around!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to see this place going strong and bring business into the downtown Fort Mill area. I finally had the chance to try HoBo's over the Thanksgiving break. I can see why this place is always busy and packed. The food and service was great! 

Their french fries were crisp and seasoned perfectly, I loved their grits and I don't even like grits that much. They have great fried green tomatoes. The wings were awesome! Their food is very unique! They don't ONLY have your \"typical bar food.\" 

I ordered the cobb salad. It had egg, bacon, tomato, mixed greens, grilled chicken, avocado, candied pecans, and ranch on the side. IT WAS AMAZING AND GIANT!

We sat outside and watched footballs next to the heaters. 

They have fun alcoholic dessert drinks too! Plus they carry a lot of the Charlotte craft beer. 

It's a great place to bring the family or friends."}
{"text":"Great place Great atmosphere definitely recommend a grouper bites and a wedge of lemon"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The burgers are awesome and the drink selection is good for a place this size.  Service has always been good, if not great, and the location is neat as well.  Will continue going for a long time."}
{"text":"Hobo's is our favorite place to eat in Fort Mill! The burgers are delicious and sides are too. Everything is super fresh and we love the casual atmosphere. At times we have found ourselves with empty glasses for longer than we'd like, but the food has been consistently great. Try the Boxcar Taters: they are AMAZING!

ETA: I have to take one star off of my original review, only because every time we go here, we are constantly wondering where our waitress has gone. Each server we have had has neglected to give us refills on our drinks unless we ask. My husband also waited almost 20 minutes for an alcoholic shake. Our food arrived before the drink did. A little disappointing, but we'll return anyway because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Not impressed. It seemed we were intruding on the staffs social time.   The burger was just ok. My wife's onion sticks were cold and my fries were soggy.   It is a very casual place, which is great, but it was not a place I will frequent.  There's better burger places around."}
{"text":"If burgers are your specialty, perhaps you should serve them on fresh rolls.
Burgers were dry, and over charred."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Hobo's.  My wife and I stopped by on a Sunday for an early dinner around 5pm.  It was pretty busy considering it was cloudy outside, and the patio was full despite the weather.  There were only about 3 seats available inside which were tables, the booths were all full.

This appears to be a very popular place, since the atmosphere is very casual, has plenty of tv's and the friendly staff.

I had the salad (no tomatoes, no onions, with extra cheese), and an order of 6 wings.  The salad was a very good portion size , and the wings were very flavorful.

I look forward to visiting this location again, as the menu has a lot of items that sound very good, and from the other guests they seemed very pleased with the food and service.

Good portion sizes, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a beautiful fall day. Had an average meal. Everyone in Fort Mill said this was the best. Didn't blow us away. Wings were good. The T Money burger was bland and had a concept of being delicious but wasn't executed properly. Changing the bland meat, larger bacon portions, and maybe a jack or havarti cheese could add some depth and improvement. Bartender was sweet but it felt like she was a server behind the bar.... if that makes sense. Don't plan to return"}
{"text":"Hobo's is a great casual dining and bar location in the heart of Fort Mill.  I tried the Chicken and Waffle sandwich with Maple aioli.  It was awesome!  Service was great so prior reviews did not ring true."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in downtown Fort Mill away from the hustle and bustle. The grilled pimento cheese with bacon and french fries were pretty good. The waitress was very polite and attentive. Cool low key spot to chill"}
{"text":"We love Hobo's. Food is always wonderful and you get a lot!!!  Great waitresses.   The onion strings are great!"}
{"text":"Everyone has been raving about how good this place is...I think I'm missing something.
We went out n a Tuesday around 11:30 am and I felt like it wasn't clean inside. Totally not what I expected, however, I had the pimento burger and it was good."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Great Service.  Wonderful Atmosphere!  Enjoying a meal on the fabulous deck is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service and family-friendly atmosphere... PLUS spiked milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Kind of crazy I have been here so many times and still failed to write a review. 

After you're seated, order an ice cold beer and the pimento cheese fritters. I'm fairly late to the pimento cheese game - but I am making up for lost time by grabbing an order of these delicious balls of goodness every time I set foot in the place! When I bring a newbie in, I get them hooked on this app immediately.

Enough about the fritters.. I have had a majority of different items on the menu and really have never been disappointed with any of my choices. I have recently been going after the taco choices. This most recent visit, my pork tacos were a lot more wet and greasier than usual but I pushed through... The burgers are always a good option too, made in lots of different fashions.

The side choices are limited so I typically stick with the house made chips. Very crunchy and delicious. 
The staff is friendly for the most part... ask for Phil at the bar! (And the other guy is great - but can never remember his name ... dohh!)

Be careful walking around to, that floor can be crazy slippery - for whatever reason. Always feel like I'm going to bust my behind trying to walk around in that place. Another great seating option is out in the [now} enclosed patio so they can adjust the flaps based on the weather. That is also where they place the artists performing live music for the evening.

For dessert - yes you have room! - try ordering one of the adult milkshakes! Woo, they are spikey ... and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a nice burger spot in fort mill. Gourmet burgers and shakes, and a real classic diner feel. The service is always good and prompt. They make spiked milk shakes with alcohol that are awesome. Affordable pricing on all of their food and just a good overall vibe!"}
{"text":"Went back to HOBOs took some friends my burger was awesome I tried I think it was the Big Apple. It's a burger with bacon an saut√©ed apples an I had homemade chips w ranch. That burger was so juicy with the bacon n those apples. As always I have a suggestion instead of cut of pieces of apples it would b good to core the apple an cut in rounds so it's just like the burger . Great combination an as always we had a sweet waitress . No wait this time but it was only 430pm lol I highly recommend HOBOs"}
{"text":"Hobo's is my husband and my weekend staple! You might not know standing in front of the building but it has an awesome patio, great draft beer selection and some of the best burgers in the Charlotte area. The salads are also fresh and filling if you're trying to go light!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago, but never got around to writing a review.

Pros: Good beer on tap. Good food. Deck seating.

Cons: Slow as heck service."}
{"text":"Not sure what people see about this place. My wife and I ate here Tuesday evening 7/11 and had a less than stellar experience. Place was not very busy and we were seated immediately. She ordered the Vagabond burger medium rare and it came close to well done. No juices at all in the burger. She sent it back and they got a little closer the second time around . I ordered a Black and Blue burger medium and it was well done. I did not send mine back as I didn't really care. However 80% of the way through my burger I wished I had. The brioche bun is too thick and breaks up in your hand and is too dry. We ended up eating our burgers with a knife and fork.
The onion straws were standard greasy stuff. Blame that on me I should know better. The fries were OK but they are French fries."}
{"text":"Excellent food, exceellent atmosphere, great beer menu! Love the burgers and cant wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times it was great!! The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Boxcar taters are my new addiction.  Loving those onion straws too!  Great little place to grab something quick if you're wandering around Fort Mill."}
{"text":"This place is really coming into it's own.  Rounding our a really good beer selection.  Great burgers and very nice patio for 3 seasons."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, attentive service. The food was excellent.  I ordered the black bean burger; a really good one is hard to find. With bean sprouts and avocado to lighten and moisten the patty, this burger was among my favorites.  Partnered with the right beverage (the bush wacker being my recommendation), this was the perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I pass this place on my way to work everyday and finally got to check it out. Definatly worth going to the burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. The french fries are hand-cut. Believe it or not for a burger joint this place has the best Cobb salad I have ever had.
The staff is awesome. There is a wait most Fri & Sat nights;but totally worth the wait.
All sauces and dressings are made from scratch. They even make there own buffalo sauce.
The pimento cheese fritters with the tomato jam on the side is a must try. Yes they even make there own pimento cheese."}
{"text":"A wide selection of creative hamburger, I personally recommend the Grilled Cheese Hamburger is so good! The hostess and our waitress did an excellent job. I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Hobo's on a trip from Charlotte to Charleston, based on Yelp recommendations. I was not disappointed. The fried green tomatoes with grits and \"southern caviar\" was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spicy and tangy. Servers were friendly and the dining room is open and comfortable."}
{"text":"I eat here several times a month. Today I went and ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I ordered it with no cheese, lettuce or tomato and Bleu Cheese on the side.  It came with cheese and ranch.  I brought it to the attention of the server who apologized and took the plate to the kitchen. Within 2 minutes the manager returned with a sandwich.  I flipped over the piece of chicken and it was the same chicken. The kitchen had just cleaned the ranch off of the sandwich. At this point I was not pleased.  I returned to the manager and told her what happened. Within 3 minutes she brought another sandwich that had cheese, Lettuce and tomato.  She again went back to the kitchen and brought out another sandwich.  Finally it was right.  I asked for the owner and was told he was \"working the fryer\".    I gave the manager my number and asked that the owner call me. I have yet to hear from them. I received a total of 4 plates 2 of which was the same sandwich with just the ranch removed and chicken flipped.  Just makes me wonder what other shortcuts are taken in kitchen."}
{"text":"Fried banana peppers are the best! I wish we had one of these in California. So good! Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Tried it. It was...ok.  Had the waffle and chicken sandwich.  The waffle was soggy throughoutout and really destroyed the meal, the chicken was great.  Service was good but it felt so unorganized.  Lots of people milling around.   Food was getting handed out the closed kitchen door instead of a window which also seemed strange.  Flies everywhere in the restaurant due to open bar windows."}
{"text":"Just an excellent experience! This location is right in downtown Ft Mill beside the railroad tracks. I visited during their anniversary celebration. There was a party atmosphere everywhere.  We were seated promptly and had a great table outside very close to the live entertainment provided by Don Kodzai- \"Reggae & World Music\". The food was great! I had the Grilled Chicken Salad with Avacados, Nuts and Balsamic Dressjng. A cold Porter from Holy City Brewing rounded out a great meal. I ll definitely return."}
{"text":"First, The customer service here from the minute you walk in is inviting and friendly.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we were ok throughout our meal . 

On to the food , I came here with coworkers because they thought you could do a lettuce wrapped burger option but they don't , bummer  bc I'm sure most come here for the sandwich/burger menu items .

I ended up ordering the southern salad with avocado , came with tomatoes and a mixture of black beans, corn , & pinto beans . No red onion though .... hmmmmmmmmmmmmm And to add chicken it was a $4up charge.  I don't think avocado should even be in the description of this salad it was two slivers on the top kinda like a garnishment.  I ordered extra beforehand bc i love avocado , honestly it was the reason I got the salad bc i thought there would be enough . The avocado was brown and even with my extra slivers it was less than a quarter of an avocado half and I wish I would've known they charged $1.50 for extra that's more than a whole avocado at Harris teeter , but does anyone actually come here for the $9 salads well $10 In my case .

Other orders included:

-Fried chicken and waffle sandwich with chips ,-He said it was ok, the chips were chewy 
-Fried Fish . She loved it and she said the handcut fries were good as well. 

All in all if you're a sandwich, burger , beer , milkshake enthusiasts I'm certain there will be a yummy option for you here . I'm just a gluten free avocado lover that couldn't indulge ."}
{"text":"So I've been exploring the Fort Mill area (see my recent review of Beef O' Bradys in Baxter Village). Thus far I have not been disappointed and Hobos exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Sunrise Burger which came with a fried egg on it with a brioche bun. It was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! At $10.75 it was a good value for an elevated burger and it included fresh cut fries. One of the other members of my party ordered the 'T-Money' which is a beef between two grill cheese sandwiches. Both our burgers had Applewood smoked bacon adding to the decadence. As if I didn't already have enough calories going on I ordered an adult milk shake a salted caramel bourbon milk shake. It also was incredibly delicious! Service was great and our server was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love that it's pet friendly.  Had black and blue burger and fries.  Delicious!  Next visit I will try the shakes!"}
{"text":"Omg love Hobo's so much! I always get the chicken and waffles sandwich with either fries or a side salad! My parents and I have turned my northern grandma into a diehard fan of chicken and waffles because of this place! Lauren and Caleb are such great and sweet servers!! They also have great drinks!! Love it here"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere . Large indoor seating area, both booth and table. Large bar area with approx. 20 bar stools.  Lots of variety in draft beer. This bar connects through open windows to the seating area outside. I would have given five stars but the service was very slow (3 PM ). I believe this has to do with the bartender waiting on the booths, tending the bar, and taking orders outside. There were several other waitresses around but none seemed to be doing the work ours was.  Our waitress was very good and pleasant.  She just had too much to do. Our food was excellent . We both had Hamburgers. They were very large and very, very good.  My wife had fries which were fresh cut and seasoned very well. I had a side of coleslaw that was very tasty. There is plenty of parking on the street and in the back.  We are very pleased with this new discovery and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great food & service.
The owner stopped by to check in on our experience. Try the Fried Green Tomato & Grits as well as the Pimento Cheese Balls!
They serve a mean burger there too!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been once, and ordered a salad. I liked the fact that the salad was not drenched in dressing, and the dressing was not too sweet. Portion was generous. I will be back definitely."}
{"text":"Wings are not good and female bartender with black glasses is rude and needs some customer service training. Will not be going back to hobos."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to anyone that visits Fort Mill! Location and restaurant are cool, food is good and creative, wait is rarely that long, good craft beer selection... just a cool atmosphere and a fun time!"}
{"text":"The food and beer is good.  But the people doing the hosting / seating are horribly inefficient.  We were twenty five minutes into our wait and watched the head hostess take fifteen minutes to seat people at four open tables.  We've been several times and the same woman always seems frazzled and frustrated by the chaos.  The bar and wait staff does a better job.  Not sure if we will keep coming."}
{"text":"We went here for the 3rd time and it is always delicious. We got sat right away and our server was great. I got the buffalo chicken and it was perfectly cooked. I went mild and the homemade ranch made the dish. Great bar food for a great price."}
{"text":"Food is decent at best! Bar service is phenomenal, friendly bar tenders always. However, a friend and I went in earlier this year and the entire place was empty, completely empty! We wanted to sit on the deck at a table and only get drinks from the side of the bar open to the deck. We sat ourselves since no one came to help us, as we sat at the high table, I would assume the lady who came over was a manager, asked us if we were eating or drinking and we informed her we were simply drinking. She then, told us we had to sit at the bar or close our tab with them and take a server. WITH NO ONE IN THE RESTAURANT! I understand from years in the service industry how things work but it was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"We have driven past this restaurant a dozen times and finally decided to stop in.  There was not wait time (Sunday lunch) and the food was pretty good.  The atmosphere was calm and welcoming and the server was friendly. The only things that held me back from giving a 5 star review was that we were not offered a high chair for our 1 year old (we had to go get it ourselves) and that his grilled cheese came out partially burnt. Overall, not a huge deal in the scheme of things.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deck is awesome, love seeing trains go by.  Food is good, especially the burgers.  Good service as well.  The only wrinkle is their incredible success.  They're so busy it's hard to get a table.  They don't take reservations and there's no call ahead.  The ladies at the hostess stand will give you wildly optimistic guesses about their wait times.  At our last visit the predicted 30 minute wait turned into 1 hour.  There's nowhere to comfortably wait, just standing around on the sidewalk outside.  Turn that lawn area into a nice place to wait, with bar service!  I would give this place a 5 with a better place to wait, or take reservations."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, was pretty good. We got fried buffalo shrimp and something else I forgot. My drink was the best thing. Server was awesome. This place probably attracts the locals. It was nothing special. Probably won't go back. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Ok. So it's a $10 burger place.  That being said the burgers were very good.  Cooked to temperature.  I asked for medium and had pink in my burger. A real plus in my book. The burgers were well topped too.

Fries were good but I felt mine came from the last of the batch. Lots of little bits as opposed to big well formed fries.  The hobo sauce for the fries was great though. I asked what was in it and got a long list of some pretty odd ingredients. But it tasted great.

Server was friendly but a little over worked. It took her a while to get to us at the start.  We were there with a USC football game on. So it was loud. I think if one cared about the game it would have been a fun atmosphere. But with tin ceilings and wood floors a little noise goes a long way."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle sandwich. All you need to know. They have an awesome beer selection w/ Shiner & Abita in the rotation. My mom loved the shakes"}
{"text":"This place is a great local restuarant. We went on Sunday for dinner with the family. They have kids meals, the wings were great and the chicken and waffles weren't bad. I'm just happy to see so many \"local\" places in downtown Fort Mill and Hobo's definitely led the way. Stop on it and support!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress, the service is awesome, the food is nothing short of scrumptious. My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich, even though this place is known for it awesome burgers. Price is affordable and you never leave hungry. The only knock is it small and ca get very crowded at times. They have a local bar crowd which takes away from the eating experience!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and maybe I just got the wrong dish.  But, I wasn't pleased with the chicken and waffle sandwich.  The waffle fell flat for me.  Although, the chicken was actually good.  My husband got a milkshake but it was just ok.  Not sure if I would return back.  If I did come back, I would definitely get something else."}
{"text":"My last few visits have been phenomenal. When the folks at hobo's replied to my review and said they would work on seating, they did. Great fast service and the food is still top notch. No reason to avoid dinner on Main Street in Fort Mill. 

Also their outdoor seating is gorgeous on their large deck."}
{"text":"Relaxing out door atmosphere 
Friendly staff
Lots of TVs and Taps local craft
Great burgers"}
{"text":"This place is lots of fun. Cool outdoor/porch area, large bar with lots of seating, fun bartenders and waitstaff. Also downtown Fort Mill is cool. Burgers exceed expectations and they have other good stuff too--the wings in particular are impressive. This place is worth swinging out of the way for."}
{"text":"We wanted Local Dish tonight, but it wasn't open yet so we decided to give Hobos another try. We have been here a couple of times and each time we leave feeling like there is much to be desired. Well tonight was our tipping point. We ordered grouper bites, a patty melt, a burger, and chicken fingers. Not one thing tasted even decent. The chicken fingers had what tasted like burnt or old grease. The grouper bites were burned. And the burgers were gross. And it was over $45 - mind you no alcohol and the chicken fingers were a kids fingers. I don't mind spending money on good food, but this place is just disgusting. I will never return."}
{"text":"This place is off the Hook! Best darn burgers in the area.  However, the best item on the menu is their Chicken and Waffles!  This item should be world famous!  If you can only select one thing and want to have an experiance, go with the Chicken and Waffles.

Great beer selection and enjoy the outside dinning."}
{"text":"Hi Jill,
Yes I had beer but stuck with my usual bud light.
Really like how the bar has seating inside and outside, nice touch.
We will be back for more great food and cocktails!"}
{"text":"After having been told a wait time of 30 mins, we were seated after waiting for over an hour.  While we were waiting we ordered a drink at the bar and watched as the bar tender had to look up everything that was in the drink. After we were seated our waitress-Clarissa-came over and hurriedly asked us if we were ready to order. She did not give us the time of day. We then ordered a salad and after a long wait received the salad with what appeared to be a dirty paper cup crushed down underneath it. Clarissa argued it was a dirty receipt. Either way there was something dirty in our salad and we did not appreciate her rudeness and received no apology from her. We then received our pretty average burger and was brought the check which contained the the dirty salad on it. I have been a waitress, I understand it isn't always easy--but when you are rude and argumentative do not expect me to come back."}
{"text":"The location is in downtown and near the train tracks which is cool. The service wasn't great and the food is sub par."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty cool little joint. They were having a busy night and seemed to forget about our reservation but managed to get our large group out on the patio.   That worked great until it began to rain and the staff worked quickly to get us in a covered area.   The food was good, I had the adult grilled cheese which had the perfect  amount of spice.  They were large plates so be sure to bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in the Key Largo area. The fish was so fresh and delicious. There were 5 of us and everybody enjoyed their food. Will be back.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this burger joint a try tonight.  Despite being a weeknight it was busy and we waited 15 minutes for a table.  However we noticed that despite another dozen people waiting for seats, they left a nearby table for six empty until halfway through our meal. They finally seated a family of four who was already there when we signed in to wait.  

Decor was pleasant but they had a lot of open floor space that could have held at least three tables for 2.

We ordered drinks and it took a long time for them to arrive.  They came just before our appetizer. Service was a bit slow during the whole meal and we had to remind our waiter throughout the meal for things we had asked for.

The food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  Toward the end of the meal we speculated whether or not the burger patties were handmade or bought in bulk at Charlotte's big restaurant supply store.  We suspect the latter, although only the folks who work there know for sure.

The beer on tap was cheaply priced at only $3 for a pint. It's got that going for it.  

I'm not sure we'll be back, but we're glad we tried it in order to support local non-chain restaurants.  But they need to improve some things and work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a some food after visiting Amor Artist brewery with another couple and their kids.  The place looks like a dive inside, very dirty looking and nothing fancy about it. The patio area is a vinyl enclosure that bar opens up to as well, and was the nicest part of the bar.  Outside is a large deck with seating that steps down to a fenced in area that must be nice during the summer.  

We grabbed some very reasonably priced beers, ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with fries to go, and took our kids out to the fenced in area to run around in the mud!  The beer selection is pretty good - not huge, but a great mix of mostly local beers.  The chicken sandwich was flavorful and moist, nothing mind blowing, but definitely better than a lot of sandwiches I have had.  The fries were pretty good, I let me wife eat most of them.  

Inside live music was getting ready to setup, so the nightlife must be fairly good - having kids doesn't allow one to see that - so we took a stroll through the nearby park so my son and I could sit on Canons while the wife shook her head at me!  If I am back at Amor Artist this summer, we will definitely stop in to check out the outdoor area and I'll try a burger!"}
{"text":"This place has a great outside deck, perfect for bar lounging and enjoying the sun or shade. There is also a smoking garden lower that's not much more then a fenced in yard with a few ashtrays. If only they'd put something out there...roses...fire pit. This is why it's not a 5. 

Food was amazing as well as the bartender and boss man. He worked his restaurant/bar and grill. He was quick to fix anything. 

I had their Shrimp dish and ordered a side of their \"Hobo\" sauce. A warm to low spice ranch dip. Great on burgers, fish, heck on french fries. The shrimp was plump and seasoned wonderfully. They could have spent a little more time getting out all the veins. For me it's not that big of a deal. But for some ladies that's a deal breaker! 

I had a glass of Guinness from a proper pour. That's a sign of respect and care for the craft. 

Expect Sunday crowd people during the day. I'll be going back during the night with the wife. It sits facing downtown Fort Mill with a view of all the statues. 

I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Hopefully I can write another review that I can put a 5'r on it. Either way it's  worth the ride down to Fort Mill."}
{"text":"I went back to Hobo's, even after having several poor experiences - but that's sometimes the growing pains of a new business and with trying to support local places. I was dragged there Saturday night in prime time kicking and screaming by my family knowing this would be a disaster. Guess what? I WAS WRONG! It was a very enjoyable dinner. We arrived at 6:30 on Saturday and had to wait 25 minutes for a table, but the place was busy and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The greeters were friendly and the service was very good. I still rave about the beer selection here. Lots of local and craft beers and reasonably priced. They had flyers up advertising the new Ft. Mill brewery Full Spectrum. As for the dinner, three of us got burgers. My wife got the chicken and waffle sandwich and loved it, sticky fingers from the syrup and all. Not everything was perfect. The burgers were all requested to be medium. Mine was a shade over medium, one was closer to medium rare and one had no pink at all - but then again - I was hypersensitive from my past visits. I'm not normally going \"OK - show me what the burger looks like inside\" during a normal meal. The table next to us also had issues though. They had a burger sent back to the kitchen.

My fries were the best they've been - well seasoned and hot. My daughter's were too. My son and wife must have gotten the end of a different batch theirs were less seasoned and cooler - not cold.

It was a firm 4-star experience. The 3 stars is for the past visits as I can't just bump it up when 1 out of 5 times has been good - but the improvement is there, the burgers were good, the drinks were cold, the service was prompt and friendly and it was a good family night meal. I hope it continues!"}
{"text":"Great food consistently- fun atmosphere great for families. Also really good beer selection on tap - they often surprise me with unique ciders too. Buffalo Chicken sandwich is the best of anywhere. Kids love the grilled cheese and hamburgers! Can't be beat"}
{"text":"I really like this place and I'm very glad that Fort Mill finally has something like this! It seems very family-friendly clean exceptional service the food was done perfectly and it had a real upbeat atmosphere. A little bit like a sports bar and Grill, but not a place that you'd want to propose to your fianc√© unless you're both sports nuts and like a lot of noise. Me personally, I love a lot of noise when there's a football game or something like that on and people are having a great time, but again it's a sports bar what do you expect! My friend and I absolutely loved the place."}
{"text":"Good burgers and local brews on tap. Service is always solid too. I enjoy eating here. I hope it lasts in downtown Fort Mill"}
{"text":"Great bloody Mary's . Bartender was great .  Fish Sandwich was good but to much bread . Find new rolls . Cool place to hang out ."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are awesome. The beer selection and daily specials make it worth dropping by.  Phil the bartender is a class act, recommend sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"1st visit today. Very disappointed. Cooks were \"down\", whatever that means. Suggestion, if you don't have cooks then close your business instead of expecting your customers to wait 45 minutes to take their food orders. If you want customers to come back, at least offer to sit them with free drinks (ice tea, soda, beer) for the inconvenience. Needless to say we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pros: Great service, great burgers, cool atmosphere. 

Cons: A little loud inside when there's a lot of people, shakes are small for the price (especially the alcoholic), fries could use a little more flavor. 

Not inclined to go back soon, but definitely on my radar for a cool, relaxing place around town to get a great burger."}
{"text":"First, they named the place Hobos. A Hobo is a homeless vagabond who is penniless. Yes there are tracks nearby but come on! Just weird. 

We visited Hobo's on a Thursday night a couple of weeks ago. Love the decor- exposed brick, large deck (but no fans or umbrellas), very comfortable and casual. The place was pretty packed and there was a wait but we were able to score 2 seats at the bar outside.  Service was attentive however we did have to request menus. We each ordered a beer while waiting for our food. I got a chicken sandwich and he got a burger cooked medium.  And then the wait started.  We waited and waited.  Three beers in and the food finally arrives.  My chicken was over-cooked, dry and flavorless. My husband's burger was VERY well done and dry. Honestly we were both so hungry we decided to just eat anyway and leave. The bartender came over to check on us and when my husband pointed out that his burger was very well done the bartender CHUCKLES and says \"You'd think that when the kitchen is getting their ass handed to them the food would come out under-cooked instead of the opposite!\" Really dude?  Did you just say that?  Okaaaaay.  Anyway, not sure if we'll ever go back.  There are so many great burger places in the Charlotte metro area, there is no need. 

For the record, I would have given another star or two based on the attentive staff, the place itself as well as the fact that is is new and they are working out the kinks.  But after the \"ass handed to them\" comment, I just couldn't."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers (I recommend The Islander Express)... with even better spiked milkshakes!! The salted caramel shake was amazing, I've never had anything like it before! I 100% will be back when I come back to visit!!"}
{"text":"Given the location and what they are trying to be I really wanted this place to be great.  It's just ok.  Pros: Very nice local beer selection. Good location. Fun outdoor area. Decent service.  Cons:  Burgers and especially the buns are below average. If I'm eating a burger away from home, it has to be great, these are not.  Greasy fries and very little creativity in the menu.  If you're in Downtown Fort Mill it's worth it for a beer or two.  We've tried several times hoping for better food but I think our Hobo's visits are done."}
{"text":"Hobo's was really good! The food was tasty and the staff was friendly and helpful. It can get a bit crowded during busy hours but it's a great place to go."}
