{"text":"I ordered Crossroads Pizza a few months ago with my roommates and we enjoyed it. The sauce is on the sweeter side, so I personally have to be in the mood for that. But other than that, I enjoyed the food and the service has been pretty fast. Also the workers have always been nice."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Ordered delivery during a lunch rush but still got to me in a reasonable time and hot/fresh. I also ordered jojos which I thought were on the bland side, but not horrible. The associate I spoke with on the phone and the delivery person were both nice."}
{"text":"Fairly good pizza, we live farther away and they were happy to drive the 20 minutes with our mass order. Would definitely order from them again the pizza had a good consistency and the crust was not too soft and not too hard. They went fairly light on the sauce it even then it will still a great pizza, just could have some more sauce."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good (sauce is sweeter than most) and the chicken is awesome. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and they hustle. This is my go to pizza place now. Much, much better than any of the national chains in Kent."}
