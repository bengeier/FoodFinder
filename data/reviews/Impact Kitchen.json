{"text":"I've been here roughly half a dozen times since Impact opened its doors. I'm in the neighbourhood, I like their food and the vibe is nice. My only qualm is how long the food takes to be prepared. I understand everything is made to order, and while that's appealing to me, it's a mildly frustrating 25 minute wait for a dish that doesn't have any protein on it. I've noticed that the wait is consistently this long despite how busy they are. As someone who also works in food preparation at a busy downtown establishment, it's painful to watch them move so slowly without any sense of urgency. If someone is taking their dish to go, there's a good chance they have somewhere to be. I always ask myself upon leaving why I leave a tip on takeout service there. Hate to be a wet blanket but.."}
{"text":"Impact Kitchen is a long-overdue addition to the neighbourhood and I am hooked on this place.  The hours are super convenient - they are open until 9 in the evening so if you're getting home late from work you don't have to rely on delivery or questionable personal cooking skills with whatever is in your 'fridge.  The d√©cor is hipster meets Blade Runner, and the staff keep it super clean.  The space is huge and there is usually a place to sit. The staff are pleasant and more than helpful.  I have ordered the power breakfast bowl a few times now, sometimes for take-out, and it has been fresh, delicious and filling every time.  It may not be a huge meal by volume, but the ingredients are fresh and healthy, and I'm not hungry until well after lunch.  (I'm always hungry!)  I have also tried the Maverick Power Bowls with chicken and falafel options, and was just as impressed.  The in-house cashew milk is not cheap (around $12) but if you're in a rush it can be a tasty and healthy meal supplement."}
{"text":"I've been here many times since it's opened. The food is very inconsistent. I can order the same thing two days in a row and each time the dish looks totally different. Different ingredients and different quantity.  Staff seems like they hate working there.  The prices are way too expensive for what you get. Terribly over priced."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week, as it's just down the street from my work. I've often heard my co-workers rave about how great it is, so I had to check it out for myself.  My goodness, was I disappointed.   This place is pretentious and overpriced and the salad isn't even that good.   I spent $20 on a salad after adding protein, plus tax and tip. My salad was bland and flavourless, the chicken was dry, and there was barely any sauce/dressing. I felt like I was eating grass.   I guess that's why it's healthy and organic - because you are literally eating grass.   The service was great, the main guy in charge was very pleasant and accommodating, but unfortunately, I'm just not about this hype train."}
{"text":"I so want to give this place 5 starts; wonderful ambiance and helpful/friendly staff. I truly do not mind paying a little extra for healthy food, however I can't get past their \"sustainably FARMED salmon\" and cold pressed juices served in plastic. Really appreciate the fact that they make fresh nut milk as well as bone broth. Great place, always happy to see more restaurants offering minimally processed foods."}
{"text":"The food is very average if not poor and overpriced to boot. There are some items that are decent and the coffee is good, however I would not recommend it for lunch or dinner. Rarely have I been so disappointed by a meal."}
{"text":"I find this place extremely overpriced for the portions they provide. I understand that healthy food is typically more expensive but not to these extremes. I can go to Fresh and pay less for twice as much food. I think this place is geared towards people who have money to burn and who are intrigued by \"paleo\" and \"GF\" diet trends.   The food is decent, I especially enjoy the raw falafel balls, but I will not be going back unless they change the price and portion size. Its too bad, because I was really excited for some healthy food options in my work neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Even if you have no interest in paleo or vegan or whatever this place has nutrirtous delicious meals made with ingrediants you can see and taste."}
{"text":"A really decent sized meal with plenty of protein, no skimping on the chicken! I thought the juice was a little too watered down/watery - I couldn't really taste any of the greens. Overall worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Tried the Zesty Mexican Power Bowl with chicken. Fusion of favours was awesome. Service was friendly and helpful. Left delightfully full:)"}
{"text":"Why does this place stop serving brunch at 11:30 am? It's not about the time of day, it's about what people want to eat, especially on a weekend. There are many places not far from this place that serve brunch well into the afternoon and they're always busy. So clearly, people want to eat brunch and not have silly time restrictions put on them."}
{"text":"I love having a healthy takeout option nearby, but I think the prices are a little high. $20 seems like a lot for a rice bowl or salad with protein. I go here about once a month but I'd probably go a lot more often if it were a little bit cheaper, like $16 or $17 instead of $20."}
{"text":"I want to give them a better review as the food is healthy, delicious and super fast - something you don't see all that often. Unfortunately, they lose points for a couple of reasons:  1. Price - I work in Yorkville and expect to pay Yorkville prices when ordering fast service food. But not in the East. Their prices are atrocious.  2. Consistency - portions fluctuate considerably. If I'm paying close to $20 for a take out meal for one, I expect the portion sizes to be fair and consistent.  3. Menu - tried to order a smoothie as the menu online states that they have them. When I asked for one, they informed me they do not have the equipment or produce yet. Maybe they should figure that out before advertising it on their website.   Overall, I was really excited for this establishment to show up in my neighbourhood. Given the above though, my excitement and anticipated patronage has and will continue to dwindle unless they can sort out their issues."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came here for lunch during the weekday. Everyone who works here is an uneducated, pretentious snob. The food is mediocre and overpriced. Would not recommended unless you're desperate for a lunch place in the area, or if you enjoy being around unattractive girls with tacky makeup and guys with greasy man buns."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! Really fresh, healthy and tasty ingredients.  Comfortable seating arrangements and friendly & attentive staff. Bright, large, open venue with a fun health and fitness theme."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best coffee shop/Paleo restaurant/co-working space in all of toronto.   The vibe is incredible. People are incredible. Food is awesome. Coffee legit.   Couldn't ask for a better way to start my mornings."}
{"text":"Love this place! Something for everyone no matter the dietary restrictions. A healthy and friendly spot. The vegan chocolate chip cookie and MCT bar are dangerously good. Fresh juices and bone broth are perfect snacks. I'm so glad this place exists!"}
{"text":"I use to frequent this restaurant often however I've realized they falsely advertise some of the ingredients present in their dishes. According to the menu, The Harvest bowl contains cauliflower however this ingredient is barely visible in the dish. After speaking to the chef, I was informed that this is only a garnish.   I strongly suggest to the owners of this establishment to amend your menu or properly provide the ingredient for your paying customers.   Until then, I would not recommend this restaurant anymore to anyone and will be sure to tell them to stay away.   Go to Freshii."}
{"text":"I've noticed a difference in portion sizes.  Feeling like I get a bit more for the cost, which is great!  Food is so good and breakfast menu is fantastic.  Happy to have this spot in my neighbourhood :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Took our lunch to go and was impressed with the world quality and quantity. An bit pricy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"We tried a Maverick Bowl and a warrior bowl and both were awesome. The proteins are really high quality and in my opinion 5 dollars for the steak is incredible value for money. We got cookies too which are gluten free and really good. Overall this is exactly what you want for a healthy meal that actually tastes good in a hip setting."}
{"text":"I am baffled by how busy this place seems all the time -  I honestly don't know who can afford eating here, are there really that many 20-something hedge fund managers in Toronto? Or do people just drink water and nurse their coffee for hours? I live right opposite and only go in when I literally have no food at home and am too hungry to order delivery. I had a salad with chicken which I ate in about 2 minutes and it cost close to $20. This was AFTER the manager (?) stepped in as and forced the kitchen to put more chicken in when he noticed it going out with a teeny tiny portion (yay for the conscientiousness btw!). It's a shame as I hate cooking and really appreciate the \"clean food\" approach."}
{"text":"what a letdown this place continues to be  I will never go to this place again finally they actually sell soup but they charge $5 for a very small soup and don't even provide some bread or a bun  even Tim Horten's does that and Tabule provides some warmed na'an bread with theirs"}
{"text":"Came here for a meet up between friends from all over the city, so the location happened to work for us. Nice and bright space, setting the scene for good times! It's more of a lunch counter style, than sit down dinner but that worked.   I got the Halo Power Bowl with kale, chickpeas, broccoli, sprouts, avocado, roasted beets, root vegetable mash, hemp hearts, green supreme dressing and grilled salmon on top. It was delicious and nutritious. Very fresh veggies, and tender salmon. Could have perhaps punched up on seasoning, but that's just me. My friends enjoyed their meal thoroughly as well. Bone broth was ordered, so that's a trend that's popping up nicely.   Quick, comfortable, hearty."}
{"text":"They charge ALOT for what you get. Like, fill the take away bowl if you are going charge $20 for a salad ($14 before a small amount of protein).   Food seems very fresh, however, quite bland. They have a great bone broth and a tasty turmeric/citrus/coconut water drink, the small size is just perfect to get you back on your feet after a night of a few too many beverages."}
{"text":"This has become my go to spot for healthy eating, from breakfast to dinner. If you are looking for healthy food this is the right place to visit! Also has free parking."}
{"text":"First off, as someone who is paleo, I'm thrilled to see this restaurant open up and I can only hope that more places will follow suit!!  First experience was ordering the steak and broccoli. I wasn't impressed by the over cooked steak, which they said would be cooked med rare. But the cheesecake with blueberry sauce was delicious.  The second time, we had the beet salad with chicken, which was really delicious, and the root veg mash with steak. This was also good and steak cooked well.  This isn't a five star foodie restaurant. This is a restaurant for people who want to eat food that tastes good and fuels their body. You definitely walk out feeling good. It's the kind of food I eat at home and know will not derail my hours in the gym. Support this place so more places like this open up!!! =)"}
{"text":"I want to try everything! So yummy! Music is way too loud for a sit in meal, unless you're alone and just texting on your phone, then the music is perfectly loud."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Corktown.  Loved the delicious, hearty and healthy \"Warrior power bowl\".  Made fresh to order, fantastic flavors.  Big, bright and welcoming space to sit and chill with your meal or coffee."}
{"text":"The people that work there have that \"I'm hipper than thou and have the tattoos to prove it\" attitude."}
{"text":"I tried going in once when they first opened and was confused and over whelmed and left immediately... However, I was pregnant so that may have been my bad.   Went back with a friend post baby and it was great! I appreciate the counter service and their food is healthy, quality and yummy. Staff was very nice. Great, clean and a unique concept."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience at Impact Kitchen today.   It is a great addition to my hood of Corktown.   The food was fresh and tasty with lots of healthy ingredients.   I definitely would eat here again."}
{"text":"As stated in other reviews this place can be on the pricey side of things. But everything I have here I love!!!  The chocolate cookie is hands down the best dark chocolate cookie I've ever had! Even better than mine!  Ha ha so it's a must!!! If you like it dark! ;)  I also enjoyed the venison stew with roasted potatoes. It was $8.95 plus tax for a small, but it came with an equal sized bow of roasted baby potatoes. I can have a big appetite at times, and I found I was really full from a small serving.   The juices always seem fresh, I wish they served them in glass bottles, but they are still great! Plus they have a large selection of charcoal beverages. Great for detoxification.   They have so many healthy options makes eating easy, nutritious and guilt free. Love that factor, plus they have lots of gluten free and paleo options.   My favourite healthy spot in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 TBH. But I'm a nice gal and I'll bump it.  I was honestly looking forward to this addition!  The neighbourhood is lacking quick, nutritious options, so I was down to try this spot out.  Having it right across the street was added incentive.  A tea and dinner (protein+1 side) turned out to be far overpriced (shy of $20 including nice tip). No way jose. There's not enough creativity going on here for me to warrant it. I make home cooked meals on the regular and the options here are all something I would make myself in under an hour. My version not 100% organic but let's face it we're all gonna die anyways.   TLDR: Overpriced for the lack of creativity/wowing my tastebuds. May be clean eating, but it's nothing to write home about. Will maybe go back for breakfast when rushing out the door. If you can't cook to save your life and make more money than I do, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the prices are pretty expensive for what you get. They've changed up the menu since last year and it feels even more expensive with the way the bowls are structured (all protein options cost extra). There is a juice and a coffee bar but it's all counter service so don't expect waitstaff to come by and take your order (there are none).   The decor is really well done and this place is huge. It's buzzing with activity, especially on the weekends and it's generally quite easy to get a table.   I would've recommended this as a good date spot but the process of ordering first, paying for your food, sitting down and waiting for your number to be called out is just clunky. Skip this and head down to the Canary or Distillery unless you're into the whole vegan/paleo/gluten-free/diet du jour lifestyle that this place caters to very well."}
{"text":"Grand opening day today and I'm excited just as a local resident! 1st meal steel cut oats with fruit and it is yummy. Super friendly staff, beautiful layout and design. Can't wait for lunch!   Will update review as eat my way through their menu.  Welcome to Corktown!  Edit: Try the Blackout Lemonade! My favourite"}
{"text":"This place tastes \"healthy\" in the way that means \"fresh\" and not as a euphemism for \"bland\". Ordered a workplace dinner from here on hungrhub. Food arrived on time, of good quality, flavourful and pretty. Prices very reasonable and falafel is even moist!  Yum"}
{"text":"Paleo, healthy, fresh. Love love love this place. Healthy bowls and fun paleo treats. Lots of seating and natural light. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"You know how kids have to get up and dance or run around after eating? That's how you feel when you eat at Impact: there's so much powerhouse nutrition and stellar flavor on your plate it makes you want to jump up. We've been twice and this is hands down the best lunch bowl we've had in Toronto. The Asian Slaw tastes like pure excitement. The Maverick is a stack of broccoli slathered with delectable pesto with slides of fresh bruschetta, avocado and sweet spuds. Last time we had the amazing warm root veg mash with micro greens, beets and avocado smash. Also tried an immunity juice shot and a matcha latte with almond milk (made in-house and tastes healthy.) It's definitely pricy but you get what you pay for, and what you're paying for at Impact Kitchen is super high quality local ingredients prepared with care."}
{"text":"Great service, high prices, slightly above average food. I had the steak and eggs, and the steak was a little over cooked for my liking (medium well). The eggs were ok but nothing special; however, the avocado that came with it was really good. The black beans that came with it were cold; clearly by design, but it surprised me and was a put off.  My wife had the avocado toast, after they told us they had just run out of the protein pancakes. She liked the toast but said it wasn't anything to write home about.  We also got some bacon to split, which was reasonably priced at $3 for three strips, but the bacon strips were pretty thin. There just wasn't a lot to it. The bone broth was scalding hot, and didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was nice and warming with the near zero degree (Fahrenheit) temperatures outside.  We grabbed some small desserts that they had; my wife had the collagen chocolate pudding which my wife loved. I had the raw chocolate chip cookie dough; it was very dense but the taste was really good.  Staff was really nice and friendly, and it was great to find some healthy options while traveling. I can't give it the highest marks, but we will probably be back just to keep having healthy options on our trip."}
{"text":"I purchased the harvest bowl for take out. The bowl is comes in was not even filled half way. I'm don't eat that much, but I ended up having to purchase a second lunch.   For $14 and change I would have expected a full portion."}
{"text":"I tried Impact Kitchen when it first opened via Uber eats. They were still working out a few kinks, especially with regard to portion size, which I found to be too small.  They have since improved a lot, adding a lot of different menu items and to-go options. Angela runs a tight ship and this is now one of my go-to spots. The only downside is that it is fairly expensive.  My favorite items on the menu are the winter citrus salad with falafel add-on; chicken bone broth, thai butternut squash soup (delicious!) and the halo power bowl.  The collagen chocolate pudding is an amazing dessert for when those cravings kick in."}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this place as a healthy choice for once.  They have local organic ingredients and the pictures of their bowls look great online.  I got butternut squash soup and the macro bowl with salmon, (adult - because there was no baby) kale, root vegetable mash, lemon and olive oil.  The soup was standard, nothing too spectacular.  I love butternut anything so it's hard to go wrong here.  But there is only one word to describe the macro bowl. BLAND. Just so incredibly bland.  I think that there's tons of places that serve healthy food but they manage to flavour the food well.  Literally there is ZERO flavour here.  This is the reason why some people hate \"healthy\" places.  When I cook at home I cook quite bland as well, but when I go out and pay about $20 for a plate of mainly kale, I would like it to taste good.  Just incredibly disappointing.  Anyone who thinks this place is good clearly is just rating it based on the healthy factor and not thinking about taste at all.  I can easily make the EXACT same dish at home for much less. Don't waste your money here, just eat at home."}
{"text":"I realize that healthy food comes at a premium, but these prices are outrageous. $12 for an 8oz bowl of chili is too expensive, I don't care how healthy.  Most of the staff is friendly there, but they are definitely over staffed, perhaps why they have to charge so much.  I appreciate having a restaurant with healthy options. Now we just need a couple more, to keep each other honest on pricing."}
{"text":"Comfortable & cosy seating and ambiance. Everything is a bit pricey for the portions offered. They have something good great on as a concept, hope they stay in business for long time."}
{"text":"A common complaint i see is that it's pricey. Honestly, for 7 something, i got the breakfast protein bowl which comes with two perfectly soft scrambled eggs, roasted sweet potatoes, a good scoop of avocado (maybe it was guacamole, lol) and a fresh and tasty salsa, all over a large bed of baby spinach. Tasty! Good portions! If i lived here, i would come here for breakfast. I would go here for a date! I'd bring my family here! Lol. Also had their gluten free banana bread. Wonderfully moist, nice chunks of walnuts, not overly sweet. Pleasant.  Was going to get a latte but they only had almond milk. Disappointing that they didn't offer more alternatives. Especially for a place that was specifically notes to have lots of alternatives (vegan, gluten free, what not)  Would be interested in trying their lunch menu, but was only there for the morning and their lunch items are only available after 11am.   Overall, good quality food (and quantity!), spacious interior with nice seating and wifi! Service was exceptional, 5 star service forreal."}
{"text":"Just left after waiting for close to five minutes to be acknowledged - which never happened. I keep going there for the food not the service and today I got fed up. There were two other people toward the far end of the counter near where the juice bar is that are Impact staff and could care less about me and the other person waiting while her and I stood watching the woman struggle to make someone a smoothie who also didn't mention she saw me and or she would be with me in a moment.   The portions are inconsistent and I was pretty disappointed with the lack of gelatinous consistency in my $16 bone broth I purchased a few days prior I'm guess they used the bones twice. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but - the second round should be cheaper and a note that they are so one knows they aren't getting the gelatin and such.   Truly disappointed and feed up!"}
{"text":"Pros: Have been here twice (once in the past week), food is above average for an above average price.   Cons: Staff has been indifferent, decor is alright but nothing to write home about.   Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Two of us went for dinner on a Sunday night and had the Kale caesar salad for one, and spiced flank steak plus sweet potato for the other.   With 2 bottled beverages (kombucha) this came to $35 incl tax.  The food was tasty, fresh and healthy and just the right amount (for 2 women) so there was no wastage.    They have a great selection of high quality beverages - no junk pop at this place.   It has a nice atmosphere - clean, simple and airy.    Semi cafeteria style so you give your order at the counter then they bring it to you.  Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Brought up the situation with the owner who apologized and said modifications are allowed. He was very accommodating and food tasted very good"}
{"text":"Very busy place.  Food is fresh, but it's hit or miss on flavour in some of the ingredients.  Falafel balls are kinda bland chokingly dry.  A bit pricey too."}
{"text":"As my friend said about this place \"It's both expensive and healthy for you\"  he didn't also mention that it's very fresh and most dishes are delicious.   The place is clean - kind of feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant and it seems to be built for the gym crowd to get in and out pretty fast.  Staff are all friendly and everything we ordered was as we ordered it. No mixups.    I will come back here again and would be happy to bring friends with me."}
{"text":"Taking advantage of the Food is King promo on Ritual and we headed over to the Impact Kitchen to try out their foods.   Let me tell you, it was worth the Uber ride.   I ordered a plain Macro box with steak, arugula, sweet potato, and lemon and olive oil dressing. It. Was. Del. I. Ci. Ous.   The steak was cooked to a perfect medium.  Less one star because the steqk could have used a bit more seasoning but the dressing was there the save the day.   There were plenty of other treats and meals there that looked promising and definitely worth another trip or two back.  Plenty of Paleo and whole30 friendly items to eat and drink.   Will try again for sure."}
{"text":"Annoyed at the very slow slow service.  For the price and location I expect at least a bag and some cutlery. I had to ask for a bag, and they didn't bother putting in napkins and cutlery.  I waiting 10 min for an iced americano when there was no one ahead of me.   For an experience that is set up to be streamline, they need to stop hiring kids and speed things up asap."}
{"text":"I like the emphasis on fresh, raw, healthy food -- but I would prefer knowing if any ingredients are organic. This is particularly important for the bone broth and the juices. The bone broth is delicious and felt nourishing; the Halo bowl with falafel balls was bland in the dressing department, but decent. The juices are ok, but some (like BEATZ) needs some zing - like lime or ginger that you can actually taste. I love the concept here, but again, I'd like some more flavour and the addition of organics. You're drinking condensed pesticides when juice is made from commercial produce. Also, the juice is very expensive: the Village Juicery juices are larger, organic, bottled in glass and have more zip. Hopefully Impact will develop their menu as they grow.  update 1.5 years later, adding a star:  Impact has upped it's game after revamping since I first ate here a few times 1.5 years ago. The Zesty Mexican was nicely done with pico de Gallo, guacamole, black beans, almond tortillas, cashew sour cream, kale that was so finely shredded that you don't have to chew it for 10 minutes, red pepper, lime wedge and cilantro lime dressing. I omitted the rice since I don't do grains. I didn't find it that \"zesty\", but for $16 it's great, filling food. I'd give 5 stars if I knew it was organic, but am getting conflicting info.   For a gluten-free, dairy-free, grain free vegan meal, this was a great find for delivery on Foodora."}
{"text":"Impact kitchen is pretty good as far as healthy food goes, however the biggest problem is that it is so damn expensive. A salad with protein and a drink will cost you over $20.   Zesty Mexican bowl is definitely one of my favourites but the chicken needs more flavour."}
{"text":"I had the beet and citrus salad. It was $16.50 with a modest takeout tip and no protein added. I enjoyed the salad, service, and atmosphere, but in my opinion it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Was excited to find out this place existed in a lesser-traveled area of my neighbourhood. Always down to check out healthy food options for my too-lazy-to-cook self.  Have tried a couple of their power bowls and their Warrior is the winner -- with added shredded chicken this is incredibly tasty (and filling). The other day I grabbed takeout and found a free muffin in my bag as well, so bonus points for winning me over with baked goods.  Prices are pretty much the same as most \"good stuff in bowls\" places in the city (12-15 bucks pending on your added protein). Food tastes really fresh and satisfying, so I'll definitely have them up high on my list for takeout options!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunchtime spot! I had the chopped salad with falafel balls. Salad was amazing and very fresh. Not the biggest fan of the falafel balls. Not as fluffy and light as traditional ones.   Friends had the maverick bowl and the kale and chorizo soup both really loved them!   Good sized portions. You'd don't leave hungry or too full! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's been a long time since I had a kale salad that was instantly so tastey and satisfying.  A little more $$ than average but the quality of the ingredients seems to justify the cost.  Convenient location, lots of parking."}
{"text":"Never again, will I come here, the staff here is terrible. - I've been here a few time and have so-so service but never anything to stop me from coming in. Today, I ordered a simple cup of Oatmeal and waited over twenty minutes for my order. The best part is the server decided to go on break and took my original order with him on his break. He sat five feet from me and chilled with it on his table instead of doing his job. When I asked someone else what happened to my order, they tracked it down on his table and tried giving it to me! Who does that?"}
{"text":"Ordered a meal via Uber Eats & food was incredible. Have tracked down the actual location & will be eating there very soon! My kind of grub!! Can't wait to see full menu & take home a gallon of the best bone broth I ever tasted."}
{"text":"Not a grab and dash kind of coffee bar, no sense of urgency, ambivalent staff, so don't expect to be in and out. Coffee is excellent if you have time to wait; I waited 15 mins in line for my coffee even while I watched people get out of line ahead of me and leave frustrated sans coffee. Only one cash register and one person operating it while two people running the coffee bar stood idle twiddling their thumbs. Absurd..."}
{"text":"Checked out their bowl with falafel for a casual dinner with a friend! Was decent sized, and tasty good, but was pretty expensive ($20) for a meal of that kind. I would give it 3.5 starts.   The vibe was nice and open, and the staff was friendly! Might go again to check out something else.. perhaps then it'll be 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"good service. good selection. healthy choices like nowhere else that i know of. bit expensive. wish i lived closer. too bad brunch is done so early."}
{"text":"Totally decent food for an absurd price.   I ordered the Warrior bowl.  Thankfully while eating it, I learned enough warrior skills that I was able to roll a bunch of suckas in front of the Tim Horton's next door so I have enough cash so I could pay the $18 they wanted for this glorified rice pilaf.    I've gone here twice now.   I'm starting to think that there's an inside joke where they come up with physically-active-sounding-hipster names for their food, which you order, and then they just drop a dollop of vegetable mush on your platter once you're sufficiently shocked by the price tag.    Warrior!!! Maverick!!! Foodstamps!!!  Is the food healthy?   It better be, because my blood pressure rises every time I see the audacity that they have when charging such ridiculous amounts.    Very similar to the restaurant 'Fresh'.   But more so in respect to the attitude that they have getting away with such economic shenanigans.     Lovely decor.   But someone's got to pay for those chairs."}
{"text":"I've been twice. My impression: Way overpriced. Small portions.   The warrior bowl left me hungry. Favors were good though. But so expensive for very little.   The meatballs. Again, three smallish meatballs and the sauce is too sweet. And the sides were bland.   I'm also not a huge fan of the cafeteria-style interior.    Won't be back. Too bad because this growing neighborhood needs decent food options."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place yesterday and it far surpassed my expectations! It seems like an ordinary cafe with 'faster' food but the menu options were sure to satisfy any palate. I finally decided on the #HeroSalad , it was the perfect balance of flavour, nutrition and portion size. Friendly staff as well, Impact Kitchen is perfect for people on the go or meeting friends for a quick bite! Yesterday I enjoyed my salad while watching the guys and girls at 'Lift' absolutely killing it. #dinnerwithaview @impactkitchen . . #salad #healthyeats #torontoeats #distillerydistrict #hiddengem #beets #sweetpotato #sprouts #hemphearts #roastedbroccoli #guac #almonds #kale #salsa"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Impact several times and have always been happy with the food until this morning. I ordered 2 breakfast bowls on uber eats for $11.50 each. The price is very misleading for the amount of food that arrived. My meal was basically a scrambled egg, 2 small pieces of bacon and a few leaves of spinach. I would have paid maybe $5-7 for a small bowl like this. Such a waste of money, I don't recommend ordering from Impact"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time. We got here around 1pm on a sunday and were told by the cashier that brunch was over, which is just ridiculous because that's prime brunch time! We ended up ordering the Mexican bowl and while we were waiting for our food, these guys show up at the restaurant and are sitting outside and we watched one of their servers walk outside with MULTIPLE PLATES of their brunch waffles and give them the waffles! UMM EXCUSE ME. WHAT THE HECK! WE WERE TOLD BRUNCH WAS OVER! The Mexican bowl was, albeit very delicious, but why were we told brunch was over and then literally WATCHED the staff walk out and deliver plates of brunch waffles to a group of people sitting outside?! Not happy about this at all...I don't even know what I'm supposed to think about this place anymore...LIIEEESSS!"}
{"text":"I have come here for breakfast and dinner, MUCH preferred breakfast. I ordered the Maverick bowl for dinner, and it was fine...but the broccoli was cold as though it had been steamed and stored in the fridge, which when combined with the (delicious) warm root vegetable mash and guacamole, was a wired combo of texture and temperature. I would have definitely preferred the broccoli to be warm. I definitely love the mission of this establishment so would come back for brunch/breakfast when in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for even just tea and a gluten free dessert. Had the protein bar as I'm also allergic to tree nuts. Tasty and not to sweet as it was sweetened with dates. Nice large coconut shavings. I suggest eating it with a fork as it's a little sticky, but that could be just me."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot! I had the magic bar, protein balls, and a bowl with the blackened trout. It's fantastic food, very healthy, and service was great."}
{"text":"High quality food that is simply prepared and always tastes fresh. We have been 3 times and I'm always impressed."}
{"text":"Went there for Sat breakfast today w/ a special someone. I had a nonfat flat white which was delicious in a to go cup. And the energy oatmeal that has berries, a couple of slices of banana, flax and chia seeds as well as cashew cream. It kept me full for 2.5- 3 hours."}
{"text":"Seems like this place is still working out a few kinks. They no longer offer the veggie power bake even though its still on the menu. They made a substitute with falafels and it was decent.  WARNING - the side of brussels sprouts contains bacon even though it's not listed.   My friend ordered the warrior bowl, they substituted quinoa for the brown rice without asking my friend and unfortunately she can't eat quinoa. They then made her another bowl with a root mash as a substitute, which she liked.  Staff are super friendly and accommodating and once this place works out its opening kinks it will be alright I think."}
{"text":"Not bad, has quite the selection of bowls to choose from. I will be back for sure to try their coffee and cold pressed juices. I got the Hero Bowl I believe.  Tasty, but smaller portion then I was expecting for the price and I could go somewhere similar for a better deal. Also, some of the veggies were not fresh-which is something I would expect from this place."}
{"text":"Ive been here for enough times I can update what I know.  I pretty much maintain what I said. Portion size fluctuates, sometimes it is more, sometimes there is less, value wise pretty bad.  The reason I come back is the convinience, also I dont mind paying for healthier food knowing it is way over priced.  They seriously need to change the staff, though. And what I mean is fire a few incompetent ones. The manager or owner guy is pretty nice and helpful, but they have way too many ppl behind the counter doing whatever. One of the cashier I ordered with did not know the price of the soups, did not know the size, and insisted my Mastercard would not be able to tap although I know it worked every single time. Why is ordering a bowl of broccoli so complicated?"}
{"text":"Great healthy food in casual environment"}
{"text":"I'm struggling with the rating for this establishment.  I want to give it a higher rating for the healthy food choices and modern spacious decor however my first experience here was very disappointing.   To start, I waited literally 20mins in line to place my order!!! There were probably 5 people in front of me but some how, it took 20mins for the one cashier to get through them. Mean while, a long line is forming behind me. Suggestion for management, if there is only capacity for one cashier, ask another staff to start taking orders from the customers in line and start prepping their order so they don't have wait another 20mins to get their food.  Starbucks does this and does it well. It's a great customer service model to adopt and implement within your business.  After I placed my order of lean bowl with salmon, I took my number to my seat and waited for my food...and waited...and waited.  After 25mins, seeing the guy who was standing behind me already finished his meal, I questioned one of the staff for my order and all I got was \"we are really busy today\". That is not an acceptable answer so I asked to speak with a manager who came by to apologize for the delay and explained they are expecting an abnormal amount of traffic today.    I would have given a 4 star except I didn't think it was good value for what I paid. For $14, I think they could have afford to give me a bit more greens."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and it sounded like a great healthy option in the east end. I had forgotten about it, but then recently I went to an event where Impact Kitchen had catered it with snacks including a cookie with cranberry, some kinda banana bar, and bone broth. I must admit, bone broth sounded hella weird but it's supposedly very healthy because the long cooking time releases nutrients from the bones. Google says bone broth helps with joint paint, boosts your immune system, helps with gut-related things and reduces cellulite..? It tastes delicious so I'm totally sold! I'm going to try to make this at home just for the flavour, alleged health benefits aside, it tastes so good!  The baked goods were also quite good, which I find surprising because they're gluten-free and Paleo. My favourite was the cookie with the cranberries. It was surprisingly delicious, and has less guilt because it's Paleo and gluten-free! The main parts of that cookie must be the almond butter and coconut flour. Very flavourful, and definitely better than a lot of non-gluten-free, non-Paleo options I've had. I am always very hesitant to try anything gluten-free because I am of the mindset that gluten is delicious and gluten-free options generally taste like cardboard, but this level of deliciousness definitely exceeded my expectations for all cookies, not just gluten-free.  I got the Harvest Power Bowl, which is a meal salad and grain bowl. It has quinoa, Brussels sprouts, bacon, egg, pickled red onion, pickled cauliflower, apples, and greens. The dressing was a light, lemony dressing. I got chicken on it. Everything was pretty good. The chicken was moist and tasted good on its own but didn't appear to have anything added. I liked how it was pulled or stringed or whatever, which is different from a plain dried chicken breast steaks. This meal bowl with added chicken was filling.  My only qualm with this place is that it seems kind of expensive compared to other places, but I suppose you pay for the novelty of it being healthy. They say that their ingredients are fresh, local and organic. A medium bone broth and the Harvest Power Bowl with added chicken came to roughly $28 after tax. It seems a bit high for a salad and a soup, but I scarfed it down pretty quickly and wished there was more, especially the bone broth.  They're on Ritual and made my meal in 10 minutes or so. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is great. I have been coming here since they opened and appreciate fresh good quality food. Although they are definitely on the pricey side, they have a good selection of hearty foods, treats, drinks, desserts etc. However, lately their customer service has been going downhill! As usual, I asked for my drip coffee to be topped off as I had just ordered a cookie after my wife and I had lunch an hour ago. The barrister told me though that they don't do refills. He was lying straight to my face since I have been coming here since they opened and they always have given refills. I told him that I'd appreciate to get at least half a cup full since the first cup was not even filled fully, plus I had easily spent $50 here today, he still denied me a refill. On top of this, their cookies used to be fresh. Recently, I buy hard cookies that are definitely a few days old and they cost around $4! What a shame that this promising place lost its quality due to greed. Don't think I will recommend this place any more."}
{"text":"Wide selection of salads and drinks. Professional service. Great price, clean and organized.  Very busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Loved it because everything is gluten free so super celiac safe. Lots of healthy, hearty salads and bowls to choose from and they use a lot of local, organic ingredients. Also big and airy and lots of seating space. A great place to read a book or catch up with a friend over a meal or a coffee. They also don't rush you out.  Cons were mostly the price. The food was good (though not amazing) and for two salads (mexican + falafel and cobb) it cost me almost $40. A bit too much for (1) the portion size and (2) the taste of the dish and (3) the setting (You order at the counter and they bring you the food, but it is still more of a cafeteria style - you don't have people serving you, filling up your water etc.)   Although the ingredients are good I still think $40 for two people is a tad too steep, though I would still go back if I was in the area (especially due to the celiac safety factor)."}
{"text":"I went into this place for a bone broth. The dude at the counter was about to serve me, then a female staff came out from no where and yelled at him, \"it is nine o five\". Ok, my bad. I didn't check your business hours before I walked in.... It was a big turn off man. The dude ignored his partner and handed me a cup of broth.   The broth was actually quite good. Selling broth is actually a trendy business down in NYC."}
{"text":"Like all the other yelpers, I was not greeted at the door and since it was my first time here, they were not generally nice when I asked about the selection.   The 'barista' did bring the coffee over and it was very pretty presented. I ordered the mocha and MCT bar that everyone raved about. The coffee is definitely stronger and bitter. The MCT bar was divine!   I really like the vibe of this place and possibly some of the selections. Though the menu seemed very pricey that I don't think I will come back unless it's for a cup of joe!   My order of a snack and coffee came to $11."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a workday and got the harvest bowl, added chicken. It came to $21.98 and took 10-15 minutes to prepare, which is a lot when I only have a small amount of time to eat before I have to be back at the office. Although the ingredients were fresh and had variety, I do not feel it was worth the price."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Decided to try because of the gluten free options. Food was cold. Bacon had been sitting around for too long. Cold rubbery eggs.  Inflexible cafeteria environment. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me be very clear: my entire visit was worth 5 stars. However had I gone on my own accord and not part of the \"food is king\" ritual promotion, I wouldn't have paid $18 for my salad.   I got the zesty Mexican bowl with some modifications since I am on whole30. It was delicious, the dressing and sweet potatoes are amazing. The chicken could have been better shredded and used some seasoning. The avocado was pur√©ed so I again expected some seasoning.    The restaurant has a cool post-workout vibe. Id go back for breakfast since I've heard from more than a few people how good it is."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy food.  Big portions and so delicious.  Not cheap but well worth it.    I had the Halo salad with some salmon.  My husband had the venison stew and a citrus salad.  Everything was incredibly tasty.  Will definitely return!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a very comfortable vibe.  The coffee is very good and there is a very good selection of food offerings.  We just stopped in for coffee and were impressed - we plan to come back again for brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!! Love impact kitchen! It's pretty pricey but worth it. I've only been twice and got the same bowl both times. I forget what it was called but it's perfect and beautiful!  I saw that they're opening a king west location (near me yay!!) and cannot wait till it opens :)"}
{"text":"Heard about Impact kitchen for a while, but never got the chance to make here. The best thing about this place is the \"water, \" triggering me to post on yelp. Not because the water itself is anything special but the staff softly brought over to me after I finished my delicious charcoal latter. Normal coffee shop don't give a damn about it, but here they certainly is aware and care about their customers. Love this gesture of thoughtfulness!   The food is delicious, miss this type of healthy colourful food with slightly over priced tag, but hey! Better than medical bills!   Love the charcoal latte and harvest bowl and the non grassy bacon and that candied walnut in my quinoa ! Will grab some more smoothie on my way home! Please open another location soon!"}
