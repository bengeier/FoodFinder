{"text":"Slow, fairly lazy service. Burgers and fries were just decent. The lights above the bar are too bright. The heat was not on either for some reason. There are too many other choices for a simple burger so we probably won't go back :-("}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time yesterday (Mothers Day) at Bunker Hill.  We rented a golf simulator instead of the golf course because of the rain.  Nicole set us up and was super nice and accommodating.  We also had the buffet which was terrific.  All four of us thought so.  The bathrooms were also super clean and updated.  Well go back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so proud to reopen the restaurant with an awesome team. Look forward to fun friendly staff with great food at a very reasonable price. Special events and entertainment is on the way. Come enjoy a wonderful experience at Bunker Hill for golf, events, restaurant, and entertainment!"}
