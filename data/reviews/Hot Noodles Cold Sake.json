{"text":"Hot Noodles Cold Sake is a spinoff of Chef Josh Hebert's very popular \"Tuesday Night Ramen\" at Posh Restaurant.  Ordering is quick, fun and simple through interactive kiosks.  The ramen, hirata buns and gyoza are absolutely amazing.  It's a very welcome addition to an area riddled with Irish bars and chicken wings.  Each dish is delicious and is the high quality you'd expect from James Beard Award-winning chef like Josh!

Edit:  it's located between Grabba Green and Skeptical Chemyst just south of Twin Peaks and McDonalds on FLW."}
{"text":"Dear Owner, please accept the following as constructive advice given in the hope that you will remain in business, because we need ramen in North Scottsdale.
Your product is tasty, so based on that, I want to keep you around. Normally I will drive 30 mins to Tampopo in Tempe because I love ramen, but I want to come to your business as it is more convenient for me, and your location is clean, and the server is friendly.
But note to the cooks, please greet me when I arrive. Not only is it traditional for a Japanese noodle house, but it would feel far more welcoming than a glance from the cook/chefs who are leaning with arms crossed waiting for a customer to an empty restaurant at 1.15PM on a work day.
As I had experienced each time I have been here, it sucks that I don't get a drink until my noodles are ready.
I have observed how long it takes your server to explain the menu ( different servers on different occasions) and it takes way too long for what I suspect you are attempting to provide... a fast experience.
Your store lacks branding. While sitting in store the only place I see the name is in reverse on the door. You should splash it about! It's not even printed on the receipt! I don't read Japanese so the giant characters on the wall are as lost on me as a millennial' tattoo.
The drink selection is too limited and the only iced tea is artificially sweetened which is a big turn off.
I hope your traffic increases! You just need to amp up the personality to drown out the exhaust fan. Good luck - from a food industry fellow."}
{"text":"Not sure how we've missed this place and have been driving a lot further for not as good ramen. We eat ramen often and in every city we visit.  This place comes in second to our fave in Vancouver. Excellent presentation, great service and tasty filling ramen. For $9, you can't go wrong. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The noodles are good. But the goyza and the mochi ice cream are not. Service is very slow but friendly."}
{"text":"Ramen was so good! But I agree with other reviews, it's pricey for a bowl of ramen. I keep coming back though because I'm so close to them and would not drive 12 mi for another ramen place."}
{"text":"Goyza dry inside and served cold- like it had been sitting for a long time.
Ramen broth lackluster- no flavor"}
{"text":"Not kid friendly.  No high chairs or booster seats. No smaller portioned meals. Wait staff not customer friendly.  Very expensive for what you got. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment.  

1.  ICE COLD Char-Siu  - I know I know.  You read it right.  I couldn't believe it either.  If you know ramen, you know that's reason enough to skip this place.  If you don't...it is never unacceptable to serve pork slices straight out of the fridge. I don't even know where to begin. It ruins the basics of basic ramen experience (think...putting cold shredded cheese on pizza).  Not only is it cold, it is completely flavorless like a slice of eraser. 
2.  Lackluster broth flavor.  - Or maybe lack of is more accurate.  You know that feeling when you eat something and you KNOW the the potential of just how good it could be...but it just doesn't and never will.  That's the problem here.  Heavily salted broth does not equal real broth.  Strangely, the miso broth is so unbelievably sweet it should be categorized under Desserts.  The sugar content is unreal. If a bowl of sweet pork broth sounds good to you...then you have found your place!   

I love to support local restaurants and chefs.  This I have to say is a big fail. I know this isn't California so my expectations were adjusted accordingly.  But...if a restaurant is bold enough to claim to be a dedicated ramen shop, then at least get the basics right and deliver.  I don't need to be wowed, just decent would be enough.  It shows lack of effort, insight and authenticity into the basics of the niche ramen market.  Just because we lack it here in Phoenix, doesn't mean we should be complacent  and rave about something \"exciting\" when it's subpar quality.  Some might be fooled but there are enough of us to know the difference."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid Ramen place for lunch this is the spot. I love Ramen and it's in a good little spot just off the freeway. I had the Goma - House Specially. My office took an early lunch on Friday. We had about 9 in the group and everyone enjoyed their experience. Only make sure to be careful with the hot sauces that are at the tables (Ghost & 7- Pot). Personally I loved them, others struggled"}
{"text":"Not the BEST ramen shop but it is pretty good. Noodles are solid. Goma house specially has a good broth. Different with shishito peppers. Bowl is pretty full with an assortment or different additions. Best ramen is Scottsdale at least.

One thing is that their self serve payment and ordering is weird. Especially for how small the place is."}
{"text":"This is AMAZING ramen!!  The Miso Ramen is the best, the flavor was rich and buttery with pops of crisp sweet corn.  My husband had the Goma, it was huge and he finished it!  The owner, Josh, was kind and very hospitable.  I will definitely crave this, highly recommend to everyone, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Posh but I had high hopes for a ramen shop in Scottsdale from what I have heard about Posh. Unfortunately this place didn't live up o expectations. As other reviewers mentioned, the style of ordering is very self serve - which I was fine with. Very similar to the iPad style ordering in many airports now. Water glasses were like 2 liter cups - very interesting....but the star of the meal - the ramen - wasn't that great. While all the ingredients screamed this should be a great bowl of ramen, I found it to be too salty yet without great flavor. Not sure I can bring myself to go back to try again."}
{"text":"Nothing special and overpriced. Spent $19.81 for a bowl,  bun and Coke. I heard that posh had opened up a new restaurant. I guess I went to the wrong place. The whole serve yourself is great at Carl's Jr. Once again my bowl of Noodles that had two pieces of pork and a sticky bun that really shouldn't be called that was $20.  Must be nyc pricing.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. This place missed the boat in every way possible. First the place had no thought of into it at all regarding decor. Second, it may have been the most expensive middle house I've ever been to ( way overpriced!). Third, you have to put your own order in on their POS system ( are you kidding me?). Fourth, we were the only people in the place that had ordered food and when the waitress wad bringing out our order she walked right pass us and yell our name. WHAT?! We have the only order in!! Then I ask for sriracha and they only have one bottle, that is the chef's, and I had to give it right back immediately. No pepper in the whole place, the hot sauce on the table was suited for a mexican restaurant and last but not least if you noticed the name of the establishment and they didn't serve liquor at all-soooo I can't have sake at Hot Noodles and Cold Sake???? This place is a bust and its very obvious they are just trying to take advantage of a popular food with no regard to the Asian culture. 

Warning: do not waste your time money"}
{"text":"This was awesome.   I had the shrimp ramen bowl and it was fantastic.   Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place.  It was our visit so the ordering wasn't intuitive yet, but luckily there was an employee to show me.  The food we ordered was great--the pork in the ramen was very flavorful and the broth was nicely savory without being too rich.  It was a really pleasant experience & we promise to return."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bullshit ramen places in town, but this is not one of them. Rich broth, quality noodles, soft pork, fresh vegetables, all served piping hot. I went in one night and mistakenly ordered the wrong ramen, and they graciously offered to cook me up another bowl of the broth I prefer-- really nice people. The iPad ordering is kind of hokey and the decor leaves a little to be desired, but heck, it feels like the little local spot that it is, and lord knows the Goliath that is corporate food needs more Davids in the world. I'd bring my foodie friends here and feel proud. 

Also, their gyoza is dope. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for lunch yesterday at the recommendation of a co-worker.  After the stellar billing, I have to say I was very disappointed.  

The shoyu ramen was extremely salty and overly smoky to the point where all other flavors were drowned out.  The miso ramen my wife ordered suffered from the same problem.  Just big, salty miso flavor overlaid with massive amounts of butter.  With the salt hitting you in the front and the butter clinging to your palate after the finish, nothing else was remotely tasteable, not even the corn. 

I also found the noodles themselves to be a bit of a letdown.  I found them too dense and lacking the springy, resilient bite I normally expect to get when I eat ramen.

Will not repeat.

An additional word of caution: although the extra char-siu pork option cost a hefty $4.00, it will only get you two very small pieces of pork belly.  Completely unworthy it."}
{"text":"Good crew, prompt service, really good cured egg in my shoyu ramen, but way too salty of broth."}
{"text":"Me and my brother we came and try the food where was an excellent place for lunch good service and good quality on food I really recommend it good job chef keep it like that"}
{"text":"1) Atmosphere: B

Very straight forward and simplistic in their decorations and vibe. I had actually  never heard of Hot Noodles Cold Sake before, but a friend suggested it and my fiance and I met up with them there, so I had no clue what to expect. It is definitely small, and when you walk in there is soft music playing in the background with some wooden 2-top tables spread throughout. One thing that definitely bugged (the F&B Manager in me) was the layout. Customers order their own food on tablets when they walk in, but the food and drinks are all expedited from a corner that is completely blocked by the ordering line for the tablets. It didn't annoy me so much, but I could just tell that it could've been much more efficient.

2) Cleanliness: A

The kitchen is totally open for customers to see into, and they kept things nice, clean and organized. One thing I noticed (not cleanliness related at all) was one of their cooks was wearing a Helio Basin Brewing t-shirt! I loved seeing this local brewery support up in North Scottsdale. Helio Basin is an outstanding new brewery in Phoenix (down by where my parents live) so it's always super cool to spot some of their swag around the city.

3) Service: B+

There's not a whole lot of service going on here to be honest - you place your order all on your own. The drinks took a little bit longer than expected to receive, since it was just sake that was poured into wine glasses. Not a big deal at all though, because we were VERY pleasantly surprised at how large of a sake pour we got! Once we got our food, our server was there and present, but if we needed anything we just flagged her down and she got it right away. Pretty easy and straight-forward. No real complaints.

4) Food: B+

Overall, great food. My ramen was solid. Maybe I would've loved it more if Brigid and I hadn't been so spoiled in LA when it came to ramen. We actually ordered the dinner special for $22 per person (which at first, I thought was pretty expensive until I realized how much you got for it). The dinner special included 3 pieces of gyoza, any order of ramen, and also a glass of \"fancy sake\".

5) Creativity: B

I liked the idea of guests ordering their own food/drink on tablets (as I believe this is how it is mostly done in Japan), but again - for food and drinks to be delivered, employees had to cut through the line of customers every time something was delivered to a table. I think the open kitchen and simple, yet refined decorations were nice to have. It lets the food really speak for itself. I would definitely go back, as there seems to be a lack of legit ramen in Phoenix still."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place exists cause I so want proper ramen to flourish in the valley but the food here is just kinda mediocre. Not bad but not mindblowing either."}
{"text":"Food & Bev, Service, Concept... all outstanding. I went for the vegan ramen and also got a glass of the daiginjo junmai. I'll definitely add this to my regular rotation and I'd love to see more vegan options on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good Ramen. Fresh Ingredients and not too costly. I have been to this place twice, and I will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for Ramen. The hot spices make it super tasty and spicy! I enjoyed the Goma Ramen with no add ins. I would get double noodle if we go back. Slightly overpriced tho for noodles. $13. Should drop to $11 maybe? Really good overall and owner is nice ;)"}
{"text":"Loved this new, independent restaurant right here in Scottsdale! Simple concept, true to its Japanese origins. There's nothing more satisfying than a steaming hot noodle bowl, embellished by tasty, traditional mix-ins like tender pork belly and lots of crisp sprouts and spring onions. You can add on whatever you like, but even the basic bowls are delicious. Haven't yet dined in house, but take-out portions are generous with top-quality ingredients and fragrant broth. This is my new favorite, and can't wait to sit down for some serious sake and before-ramen treats."}
{"text":"It was good and the service was lovely, but I wasn't blown away by the ramen.  I thought the price point was a little high as well, but overall it was a fun lunch with the family."}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Japan! Ever since being there, I've craved really great ramen, but it's extremely hard to find. Most places just don't serve ramen with enough flavor to match up to the real thing. Not so with this place - beautiful flavors, atmosphere that reminded me of quick ramen shops in Tokyo, and a surprisingly quality selection of sake. This is easily the most authentic ramen in the valley, and I'll be back many times with friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the shrimp ramen with Kirin. Nice contemporary ambiance and friendly staff. I wish the menu had more items. The broth range is narrow:  there is a seafood and a vegetarian broth but most are pork based. I think they should have non-pork based broth like beef- or chicken- based. That said, the available food is tasty. great job!"}
{"text":"This restaurant mimics the \"vending machine ordering\" available in Japan.  You walk over to an interactive touch screen monitor where you can place your order.  For those who are familiar with ramen & its variety of broths & extra toppings, its quick and fun.  For those who are new to ramen & unfamiliar with the process, it can be cumbersome and require the sole food runner (which is appropriate for the size of the restaurant) to explain the ingredients.  

That being said, our ramen bowls were served to us pretty quickly.  We ordered the Goma House Specialty and Shoyu Ramen (pic) with a side of housemade Japanese pickles.  The Shoyu Ramen was beautifully plated: The broth was light with a hint of soy sauce with the pork flavoring; there were proportionate amount of Char Sui pork, the cured egg was flavorful (a tad bit on the salty side), and the bamboo shoots, Kamaboko (fish cakes in white with pink swirls), and bonito flakes were nice traditional touch.  The noodle portion was on the small size and the $4 charge for Kae-dama (extra noodles) is much higher than all the other ramen shops we have visited in the metro Phoenix Area.  The house pickles were on par.  The Goma House Speciality with the extra topping of onsen egg looked delicious.  We wished we had more pork flavor and more noodles.

They were not offering Daifuku (mochi ice cream) for dessert, so we left after noshing on our ramen bowls.

This spot has potential and look forward to re-visiting after they work through their menu options and ordering process.  Would you consider a self serve water station with a spigot or maybe a full beverage station when you get settled into the space?!?!"}
{"text":"I've had every broth except for the vegetable and they are all unique and different but all super savory and complex. Char sui and pork cracklings are good. Pork buns are super delicious, have two different sauces that go perfectly together. Get the Orion beer. I go every other week and it's never enough. The noodles are better than the ramen places in Tempe.

*Ordering yourself on the Ipad is actually an homage to places in Japan where they have a little wall with a bunch of pictures and you press the one you want and insert money."}
{"text":"I felt bad because the people were really nice. But I'm not a fan. You can tell this is totally white washed \"ramen house\" lol. Their presentation was nice. I thought it was weird how you had to place your order yourself and pay before eating. It was pricey for average \"ramen\". I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted all these bad days I've been reading to be just that. I've been to Posh's ramen night before, and I was super excited that they finally opened a standalone location. But everything about my night was just disappointing.

It's a really tiny restaurant - from a place that used to serve gyros, cheesesteaks, etc. there's only about 20 seats. You can order on the iPad, get your check and they'll bring your food out to you. Maybe that's the reason why service was really slow - since they don't take your order, it's REALLY hard to call someone over for service. Didn't end up getting water until 5 minutes after getting our food, and even enough chopsticks for the table. Might have been an end of the night thing, but it was really funny that all four of us got completely different glasses for water.

But what broke the camel's back is violating not just ramen as whole, but the name of your goddamn restaurant. \"Hot Noodles Cold Sake\" should be renamed to \"Lukewarm Broth Cold Chashu\". The main meat of the dish was ice cold to the touch - verified with my table mates - as if they took it out the fridge, sliced it, and dropped. The broth itself was tepid as well - not only lukewarm, but somehow managed to have the right thickness for a pork broth with little flavor. As for my deluxe toppings, the onsen egg white was dope but the yolk was somehow overcooked to that of a medium boiled egg (same with friend's). And my cracklings had good flavor, but were borderline burnt. Everything else topping-wise worked but didn't compensate for the failures already in the bowl.

Maybe the gyoza could save the day? Hardly. The wrapping was cold, and the stuff inside was so unpleasantly overcooked - like that really tough meat from the first time you made hamburgers and failed. At least I had Kirin to wash it all away.

Even if it were good, I don't know if that would be worth the $21 sans tax. Dish execution varying from place to place is nothing new to me, but the biggest issue being heat is such a joke. Sad thing is, they would have gotten a second star from me if they just used a heat lamp. Probably the third if they actually serve their food hot."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you place your own order on a touch screen. The menu is limited but enough to choose form and is located on the wall for easy choosing. The staff was helpful when needing an explanation of the menu. The food was really good and fresh. The restaurant was clean. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic
We ordered out (4 different ramens) and while driving back to the office the aromas were enough for me to think of tearing into the containers and devouring the food.  Excellent tastes and wonderfully prepared. You can tell there is a lot of effort made for the ramens when you see the  mise en place.  My coworkers and I all gave this a 5 star for the food.  This might turn into a weekly luncheon tradition."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Never knew ramen till I tried this place. Super friendly staff. Been there several times and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is soooooooo good! It's almost great. 

I love the simple concept, the ramen is just the best. The broth, oh, so dang good!!! I would ask for this to be my last meal if I could! 

Staff has always been pleasant. The seating isn't my favorite, not comfortable to sit and hang out. I would come more often and drink more sake if the dining room was nicer. 

Only other comment was my steamed bun was cold... I don't think it's supposed to be chilled? Maybe I'm mistaken?! Still tasted amazing, especially the homemade Japanese pickles!!! So yummy!! 

My husband had the chicken ramen with black garlic broth. I had the house special, which is always good. 

We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"For North Scottsdale, this is as good as it gets! I've checked in four times before realizing that I haven't written a praise for this place yet. I heard about this ramen place through a friend who was really impressed and I had to try it for myself. Little did I know, I became an addict. 

The staff is super attentive. I was immediately greeted right when I walked through the door and asked if I have been there before, though they've stopped asking me since I've had this place at least once a week since discovering this restaurant several weeks ago.  They have an iPad self-ordering/paying system with loyalty rewards. Heck, it even remembers what you ordered last time you came in. 

Don't let the American staff fool you, the ramen taste delicious. I have tried the goma house specialty ramen and shoyu ramen. I highly suggest the shoyu ramen. I get mine with an extra soy-cured egg or onsen egg because they're so good. Totally worth the extra $1.50 or something like that. The pork broth is super flavorful and a little on the savory side, just how I like it. It also comes with the very tender Char Siu Pork, such a good addition to the ramen. 

There are so many things I want to try on this menu. I'm definitely returning to try their appetizers and sakes during the Happy hour from 4-6pm sometime. The overall vibe is chill and worth checking it out at least."}
{"text":"The ramen itself is worthy of 5 stars. I ordered the miso ramen with an add on of an egg. It was undeniably delicious, but it cost $18. 

My biggest hang up is the price point. The shop itself is a small storefront that has been minimally yet tastefully appointed, but the kiosk ordering gives you the feeling that you're in a fast food joint....until you realize you just dropped $40+ bucks on two bowls of ramen and one diet coke. I understand that there is prestige attached to the chef, and the food is great, but the concept just feels flawed. The ramen is already more expensive than any other ramen I have had, and the add ons cost between $1.50-$4.00. I added an egg because mine didn't come with an egg, and what is ramen without a softboiled egg? That cost a buck-fifty. 

Now, I'm not from Scottsdale so maybe I'm not the customer they're seeking, but I imagine even the average high-income Scottsdalite has a budget and wants quality and value. I sincerely hope this place makes it because the ramen is that good, but with the prices it might be tough to get a regular following or a lunch crowd from the air park."}
{"text":"Staff was super nice, helpful, place is clean! Food is just not good. Noodles are not fresh, they charge for egg-in Ramen? Really expensive for what you get. I had the shrimp ramen and it smelled fishy, my boyfriend had the pork-nice flavor but the meat was not high quality.  Would not recommend. Better places for ramen in town."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bowls of ramen I've had in Arizona. Okay, it definitely is the best bowl of ramen in Arizona because the creator is the same guy that created Tuesday Ramen Night at Posh! I could definitely go for another bowl right now. Tampopo in Mesa is just okay compared to this place and I think it's because of how delicious the broth is here. 

When you walk in, you place you order on a tablet and then find a seat. Finding a seat may be an issue during lunch hours or a busy night because the restaurant seats 22. If there is a wait, it will be worth it. 

I think I ordered the goma bowl and added an egg. Looking forward to another bowl in my near future. I'm definitely glad it's close to work because now I have another lunch spot to add to my rotation. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this place opened, but I just recently discovered it! After moving back here from CA, I was in desperate need of some ramen. I love this place! I've had 3 different ramen bowls and they were super yummy. Also a heads up to any vegan or vegetarians; they have a very tasty vegan ramen :) would recommend!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had in the states doesn't get any more authentic then this. Service is prompt and extra friendly. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen in Scottsdale- THANK GOD and about time. I have tried the miso and the seafood, both with onsen eggs of course, and they are both DELICIOUS. I intend to try them all. In addition to being delicious, they offer a dinner combo- ramen, gyoza and Kirin (or Kirin light) for $18 or a choice of two different sakes for $22 (There is a lunch combo too). I'm smitten. Very clean interior with tasteful decor and good ambiance, making it a great spot for a cozy date night. Super friendly and helpful staff. If you love ramen or you just want some amazing comfort food, you must try! I have yet to take a picture of the deliciousness as I have been too eager to eat to remember. This is already one of my favorite dinner choices and it takes a lot for me to drive far very from my home."}
{"text":"I went with some coworkers at lunch.  We entered the establishment and there wasn't a loud welcome greeting typically heard in other ramen restaurants, but instead an impersonal self service ordering machine where you pay up front. 

We received the food and the soup broth was lukewarm, the egg and pork was ice cold.  Price wasn't worth what we received and we left still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Great ramen....I had the pork Ramen the 1st time & it was GREAT!!! Today the GM gave Sisig with should broth....DELICIOUS!!! Brian & his team are doing a great job....."}
{"text":"I went there because I read good newspaper articles but what I ate looked interesting and flavorful but what the taste was bland and boring. I had the gyoza... Run of the mill potstickers, had the homemade pickles... Yep they were pickled veggies, had the parked steamed bun... Delicious and raised my. Hopes for the shoyu Ramen Bowl with add egg and cracklings... It literally tasted like a bowl of warm broth with bean sprouts. Nothing stood out, nothing tasted unique. I thought I was coming for something that was creative and cultured, but instead I got a step up from Campbell's. That steamed bun was delicious though, but probably won't go back for another"}
{"text":"I can make better ramen from the little 88 cent packages you get at the grocery store. Good concept and good service but the food was very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Since this place is an offshoot of Posh and because my friends have raved about the Posh ramen nights, I decided to give this new establishment a try. On my first visit I tried the Goma with an added onsen egg. The broth was good but needed to be hotter; it seemed that the noodles would have cooked better had they been in hotter broth. The other ingredients helped enhance the flavor profile of the dish, except for the char siu pork which I found to be cold and nearly flavorless. That first visit was a bit of a let down but I wanted to give it another try, as that may have been an off day. 

I returned with my friends a week later and ordered the shoyu ramen with added cured egg. Different flavored broth, also quite tasty but again there was that issue with the broth not being hot enough, and the blandness of the pork. One in our group shared the gyoza she ordered and I found it quite dry. The service was efficient, the client-operated digital ordering system at the counter was a nice touch, and the décor was appealing. It seems that some tweaking is needed for the food and hopefully they'll be able to work on that soon."}
{"text":"We both had the chicken ramen special for $13 I'd expect white meat chicken for the price.  The broth was good and the noodles were firm however my meal was $29 for dark meat chicken noodles and a glass of wine. The food was ok but I won't be returning.  Plus the self service for ordering is fine however the register asks for a tip and other than bringing out my tray of soup I didn't have any service.  We waited for over 20 minutes to ask for a to go box.  And just left."}
{"text":"It's not that it isn't good. Owners are very friendly. Food is fine. I think I'm just spoiled by the restaurant I frequented in Irvine, CA."}
{"text":"This is a little hole-in-the- wall place. Ordering here is a little confusing at first as it is done on your own on an ipad. Thankfully there was am employee who helped us figure it out. We ordered the goma, shoyu, pickles, and a pork steamed bun. The goma broth is SPICY!! The peppers definitely are the star of that ramen. The shoyu had the traditional mellow lightly pork flavored soy sauce based broth that blended well with the other flavors. The char siu is very tender. The veggies were nice and crunchy. The soy cured egg is probably the best I've ever had and perfectly soft boiled. The pickles are less traditional pickles and more a mix of pickled veggies. They were all slightly sweet and vinegary with a good crunch. The steamed bun dough was tough. The sauce on it through me off though. My boyfriend thought it tasted like a big mac. Overall it was a fairly decent ramen."}
{"text":"Very happy we tried Hot Noodles and Cold Sake for lunch yesterday!

My daughter and my foreign exchange daughter are both big Ramen fans, and I can't wait to take them to Hot Noodles!

First, it's two doors down from the Grabba Green - took us a while to find them in the parking lot.  

You start by walking to the tablet at the end of the counter and entering your order.  A little odd that the first thing you have to choose is your drink, but that was more than made up for because they have Vernor's Ginger Ale!!!  (the best, if you haven't tried it yet).  They also have Fresca, if you're a diet soda person, so they've got the atypical-but-awesome sodas covered!

I got the Miso ramen.  When it arrived, it was a work of art!  Then I added some 7 Pot hot sauce - wow!  (Careful, it's fiery - and they have a Ghost sauce, too)

Really really really great!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The person who took my order was helpful and it was nice to order off of an iPad. The ramen was good but not amazing. Granted, I have been to Japan and all over Asia so I have eaten great Ramen. I did get a stomachache later on that evening. I may go again."}
{"text":"Very well 
Good food 
Very hot noodles and very cool sake
Thanks to the chef so friendly and good service 
Quit service I don't wait to much and they have full house eating 

Thanks guys !!!
I back soon..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and absolutely love the food, but it is a completely shitty experience ordering. They only have two kiosk computers for you to place your order on and the line always gets backed up. A couple times they had an awesome lady to help people who didn't understand how to order, but the last few times, no one was around to help. My boyfriend and I went here tonight and there were two elderly couples attempting to order in front of us. They were clearly having issues and the staff just stood there and watched them, I even saw a couple of the guys go into the back and laugh at them. I had to step up and order everything for them just to get the line going. The whole thing was absolutely ridiculous. Food is awesome, but they need to step it up big time with the customer service."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Excellent food and a  relaxed environment. Authentic Japanese quality (I lived in Japan for a year)."}
{"text":"As yelp would say 2 stars - \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"

It's not a bad ramen place, its actually on the better side of the ramen you get in Arizona. But I have for sure had better. There is a place in Tempe called Tampopo Ramen, which is far superior.

The location is nice, small, and what you'd expect from a typical ramen shop. Parking is easy which is a plus, also right by the freeway.

The food is expensive and it isn't that flavourful. Maybe slightly on the salty side. Everything here is an extra and doesn't seem to be included in the already expensive prices.

I'd come back if I were hung over and too lazy to drive elsewhere, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed yesterday when my daughter and I went to lunch.  It was a mother/daughter day and we chose this as we both love soups and ramen.  We ordered our food: steamed pork bun, Shoyu soup lunch special, Shrimp soup lunch special.  My daughter's soup came out first, not our steamed bun which was supposed to be a starter. We also had drinks with our meals for which I had to ask her (waitress/hostess) to give to us several minutes after we ordered.  She just sits there. I could see my soup and the starter sitting at the sous chef station and there appeared to be a bit confusion.  Next thing the \"waitress\" or \"hostess\" (I couldn't really understand her function there since she didn't take orders and basically just sat there) took what appeared to be my meal to another table, who had come in after us.  I told my daughter to go ahead and eat as I couldn't figure out why mine didn't come out with her meal and I didn't see it on the sous chefs station.  About 10 minutes later the waitress and the sous chef had some interaction and I could see they realized their mistake.  The waitress went up to the table that she had served my soup, took the bowl and gave it to me.  I pointed out that she had taken it off another customer's table and that the soup spoon had been used and the napkin had soup drippings on it.  She denied it saying the spoon and napkin were just dirty(which in itself is disgusting), gave me a new spoon and napkin and walked away.  I was horrified and I hope I that person that had my soup didn't have some illness, and I would have to look into if the State finds this a possible health code violation. Then I told her the steamed bun was cold, she argued with me on it and then she touched it to find out it was stone cold.  Not sure if she went back and microwaved it or what.  The edamame were also stone cold (probably because it was sitting at someone else's table with my soup and steamed bun).
What should have happened is once she realized the error she should have explained that to me and either offered a comp or asked if I wanted to wait for a fresh soup.  She did neither.  However, she argued with me that the person at the table where my soup was didn't eat any of the soup (how would she know) and that the spoon was just \"dirty\" (which in itself is disgusting).  There was no way for me to see or know if the person at the other table had begun eating the soup and really it doesn't matter. Since I didn't want to make a scene and ruin my daughter's day I began eating the soup. The soup, however, was very salty, the edamame were cold and the thought that someone probably ate some of the soup, I didn't finish either.  As stated I am a big fan of soups in general, but just couldn't finish it due to all these issues.  My daughter tried it and without my comment stated it was way too salty.  I should have complained louder, but as stated didn't want to ruin my daughter's day with me.  I also believe the way the \"waitress\" or \"hostess\", whatever she was, dismissed my earlier complaint it would have done no good to complain further to her as she clearly doesn't care about the customer.  To be honest since it is basically self-serve to order and I just saw her stand around, couldn't get the food to the right I don't know what value she serves this establishment (except maybe you have to have someone that can serve  alcohol).  

Either way this was terrible customer service overall and it could have been simply resolved and turned around if one person had compassion and not dismissive to the customer's needs.  

BTW Flagstaff has a great ramen place, but I'm not going that far just to get ramen. Anyone know of a good local one for next time?"}
{"text":"They've got some high quality delicious ramen noodles! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I hope this place makes it as authentic ramen is just about impossible to find in Scottsdale. The broth was good....cleaner (not fatty) than most authentic ramen houses.  The noodles are good..a slight chew to them and I suspect the same ones that are ordered from LA that most of the others use. Char-siu was good, perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, and the kamaboko (fish cake) was a pleasant surprise.  The bamboo shoots tasted rancid, like they were from a can....think the smell of San Francisco's Chinatown!  We also ordered gyoza, which were extremely dry.  It almost seemed like chicken gyoza.  I can prepare them better at Costco.  
The other appetizer I tried was the pork bun.  Flavor and spice were good but the bao was cold, dry and bordering on stale.  I would expect it to be warm and fluffy....having a freshly steamed quality.  Disappointing because I was excited when I saw it on the menu.

My biggest issue with this place is the price point. $13 for a bowl of the base level of ramen just seems like too much. By adding an egg or some \"cracklings\", your bowl can quickly approach $18.  Perhaps this high rent district in Scottsdale, but to pay an excess of $40 per couple for a modest ramen meal just seems outrageous.   
I think I'll come back again and hope they're able to work out some of the kinks. I'm willing to pay a premium for my food IF the food is premium and worthy of the price."}
{"text":"Tried this ramen place with some friends due to reviews here on Yelp. With sake in the name of the restaurant you have to have sake. Found out I do not like sake. Lol!! I got the dinner combo which comes with ramen, gyoza, sake or beer. Tried the goma ramen which is delicious. Good flavor! The gyoza was just ok. I've had better. It was also served lukewarm not hot. I tried a pork steam bun and it's not what I expected. It's not bad but it's on the sweet side which was unexpected and I didn't care for the sweet. The flavors didn't seem to go together for me. The Ghost and 7 Pot hot sauces I didn't find hot and supposedly the 7 pot is hotter than the ghost sauce. I kept having to add more of each but I like spicy foods so maybe that's why it didn't seem so hot to me. If you're not used to spicy I would do a little at a time. Cute little ramen place though and the ramen is delicious and that's what mattered. The staff was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is good if you are super American and never tried Japanese ramen. I got the miso ramen and i usually drink all of my broth and this is the one time that i didn't even really touch the broth. It is also pricy for ramen that didn't live up to my standard. This cost as much as the ramen in New York... I rather eat in NYC."}
{"text":"I heard this place was pretty good, and after traveling all of January and trying different ramens, I was tapped out, until one night the hunger hit me. My first experience with this place was doing take out, which wasn't bad, but I felt the broth ratio and the noodle ratio was off (I ordered goma) and it annoyed me that there was just a quartered piece of bok choy thrown in there. I'm pretty good with chop sticks, but there's not a great way to eat the vegetable when it isn't cut atleast a little bit. The broth is delicious for sure, but I did try and eat part of a pepper, and it wasn't for me. I honestly don't think the peppers are necessary.

I was told that pick up for our take out was a little confusing but it ended up okay. I found, that when I came here for lunch he other day, that the place was packed. I ordered the Goma with an egg and hurried to a table so I could sit down. The goma was still delicious, but of course I still was annoyed with the bok choy and the peppers of course, the char siu was good, and I usually don't even like that! Just a good flavorful broth. I did notice even when the manager tried to help people order they were still confused why there wasn't an order taker. Maybe they should make a huge directions sign. Anyways, it's not the best ramen of all time in the world, because... it's Arizona, but I will definitely be back because I live so close and I want to try the other kinds."}
{"text":"Place is definitely a hole in the wall but really good food. 

The broth was yummy and their pork was cooking perfectly. Combo deal gave me a bowl, gyozas, and a beer for $22. Can't beat that price for the value and taste. 

This is an order up place, so if you're looking for someone to wipe your face and give you a check go somewhere else. Will definitely be back for some delicious ramen and great conversation with the owner."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen joints in Phoenix, decent noodles, and good menu selection. Wish they had a spicier broth, but the ones they do have a very good."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place (it is close to my house) and was excited to try it out. So i went here today for lunch, one word: disappointed. We ordered The Goma house specialty and Miso. The house specialty was meh, boring. My friend had miso ramen and it was so salty that he couldn't finish it (he took 3 bites and that was it for him). Price wasn't cheap. Tiny portion. For $9, we got two thin slices of char siu pork, shishito peppers and two sheets of nori. That's about it."}
{"text":"I love noodles but I'm not sure about this pls 
The noodles are not fresh that's for sure 
They charge you $1.5 for the egg???????? What who does that 
It's like you go to a pizza place and they charge you for the cheese . That's part of the roaming dish that's the all point 
I ordered the shrimp one and the taste was ok and not more then that 
The place is clean and the stuff is nice 
I'm not sure about the food there 
If you open a business like this you need to make sure your food taste good and like I said it was ok 
Also very expensive"}
{"text":"So so ramen.  Broth needs some more umami in it. My charsiu was cold.  Also had the pork buns. Those were really good.  Overall not bad.  They just need to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"Yay! A new ramen shop in the neighborhood! I got the Goma. Delicious! I ate every last bite. The service was so super friendly and helpful. Nice laid back place. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new noodle shop opened by the owner and chef of Posh. Chef Josh knows his noodles and brings his training into this location. We tried a few of the appetizers and then ordered our noodles. I had the shrimp ramen which was excellent. Fresh noodles flown in from Japan and a bit of heat in the spices. The portions are generous - definitely will be going back and will take my teenaged boys. My husband was able to get a beer and I was especially happy to find some AZ wine on the menu. He had a nice red blend called Prospector that rounded out my meal nicely.

I think they are still working on getting a sign. It's located  next to the Skeptical Chemyst just south of Twin Peaks and McDonalds on FLW. The atmosphere is perfect for a noodle shop and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you live in North Scottsdale and fancy something called Ramen this is your place.  Strip out everything they add to the bowl, choose your own ingredients ... maybe one could call that Ramen.  While there's zero feeling of anything Japanese, they do make a decent tasting soup.

That's more then I say for other so-called Ramen joints in Arizona, most look & taste like some sort of origami soup ... or worse! 

Venture down to Tampopo in Tempe for a proper Japanese feel, homemade noodles, and soup that barely squeaks by.  Nishikawa in Chandler represents the only real Ramen effort in AZ,  but its overly rich complex flavors are not to everyones taste. One must travel to Monta's in Vegas for a proper bowl of Japanese Ramen.

Listen folks, Japanese Ramen is an Art that takes years to perfect, Americans just don't seem to have the tenacity to master its nuances. Even in Japan very few restauranteur's attempt Ramen. 

My hats off to everyone who makes an effort ... but by all means ... try harder!"}
{"text":"Ok, I was super excited for a delicious bowl of ramen. I think it was good, but not 5 stars good. I was a little underwhelmed. I didn't leave thinking it was AMAZING. For lunch, it's pretty pricey at $12.50 for a drink and a bowl of ramen. The broth was flavorful, but the seaweed was sooo strong flavored. I got the house specialty and really most of what I could taste and smell was the dried seaweed on top. The noodles were cooked perfect and had a great chewiness texture. I might try it again at some point."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. The location is convenient however there is not a lot of space for seating. When you add in the learning curve for the self ordering system the line can get really backed up. We had the Goyza, which were fair. I've have had frozen Trader Joes Goyza's that were better. The avocado salad was fair. The avocados were not too ripe and presentations was not the best. I had the Miso ramen that didn't really have much pizzazz for the price. I would not have expected to pay almost $100 including tip for 4 noodle dishes, apps and 2 beers at a spot like this. The only silver lining was the fact that the Kirin beer was good. Can't go wrong with that! Bottom line, I'm still hungry as I write this review in front of the establishment. I may just get a Rubios Burrito for my second dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I'd say first I'm stoked to get a ramen place in Scottsdale.  I thought the ramen itself was decent, but not mind blowing.  Seemed expensive for what it was.  I will definitely go back, but no where near as good as Tampopo in Mesa."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but definitely not great. I really had high expectations but the food was just average. The service was 5 star, however."}
{"text":"Great authentic ramen in a part of town that lacks authentic Asian food. Loved it. I got the shoyu and my kids all got the kids ramen which is only noodles and broth. Kids all were and so was mama. I also tried a pork bun as it was half off on happy hour. Delicious. But I don't think I'd order at full price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place like many other reviewers but like them I was disappointed too. Their menu is definitely over priced I ordered the Shoyu and it was a $15 bowl. The broth had the thickness like regular ramen broths but this had no flavor. The noodles were good and so was the egg but I couldn't even finish it. I'm just so use to authentic ramen and this was definitely not. My brother ordered the same thing and he ended up throwing up all of his food and didn't feel good for the rest of the night. The staff was nice and very accommodating but don't waste your time with this overpriced \"ramen\" joint"}
{"text":"YUM!! I never knew there were so many possibilities for Ramen noodles! I had the chicken and noodles and it was delicious. The service is good and quick, the attendant was there to help you check yourself out on the iPad. The only thing I would have done differently is face the wall so I could slurp those noodles into my face like an oinker!"}
{"text":"BEST Ramen in AZ. I've been to all the other places around and I've even been to Japan for Ramen. This the closest AZ has gotten to authentic Ramen. 

They let you add extra noodles for an uncharge, and it's totally worth it. I've had the shoyu ramen and the goma ramen and both were delicious. The bowls are about 9 dollars, extra noodles are 4 dollars, so the whole thing with tax comes to about 15 dollars, but you could easily not get the extra noodles and come in around 10 bucks. So I think the price is more than fair. 

The broth is flavorful, not fatty, the toppings are delicious. Char-sui cooked beautifully, soft boiled egg cooked perfectly, noodles are the right texture, the whole thing just works. I don't eat the bamboo shoots so I'm not sure how to feel about those. 

If you're in Scottsdale, craving Ramen, definitely give this place a try. 5/5 would bring anyone there!"}
{"text":"Food is good!  I haven't been to too many noodles places in AZ yet, but for being the second place I've been to, this one takes the cake so far. I'll def come back!"}
{"text":"Well, I am not typically the type of person to give restaurants a \"second try\" if the first visit wasn't good but in the case of Hot Noodles I am glad I gave it another whirl. First time I got a bowl as take out and by the time I got home (5 min away) the noodles were totally gummy and mushy. Not a big deal IF the broth wasn't super bland, which it was. Huge disappointment. Fighting a bit of a cold, or allergy ick or something my husband and I deduced to stop in for a bowl after a Home Depot run tonight and BOY were we glad we did. Umami bomb to the maximum. I had the Vegan with shrimp and egg and It was a mushroom dream. Well, not that kind of a mushroom dream buy you know what I mean. Meaty, rich and dimensional. My fella is a tough customer sometimes and he loved his shoyu. I didn't sample his because I'm not down with pork anywhere in or around my mouth but two thumbs up says my pork loving friend. We are certified to make this claim because we have been to Japan and slurped our way through Tokyo's ramen street and tonight's version could have fooled me in a double
Blind taste test. It's definitely legit, so we will
Just have to overlook the fact that $57 for two bowls of ramen and two bottled waters is approximately 2.85% of a business class ticket to Tokyo. Arigato."}
{"text":"To be honest, I have no idea what good ramen is, but having said that, the food here was absolutely delicious. For me it had the perfect amount of spice, yet you could really taste the layers of flavor. 

I had their Goya and my husband had the chicken ramen. We couldn't decide who had the better meal!

Definitely order a second helping of noodles and take the leftovers to go!!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's some good ramen! People who haven't had authentic ramen don't know what they're missing. It's nothing like that junk you buy at the grocery store. 
I like the setup and how you can customize every single ingredient. They have a bunch of different broth bases, and if you come during happy hour, there are some great deals. They have a great menu and everything is fresh. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and it was so good I came back again a week later. Staff very friendly, food is delicious, and it's clean. I wish the portion was a little bit bigger for the price, but the flavor is so delicious that I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This was a great place! Really easy and quick to order, easy to customize it!! Taste was great :) fairly inexpensive for all that you get. $12 for lunch and $18 for dinner! The steamed bun was an interesting twist but had a kick to it!"}

Not too impressed. I do prefer spicy ramen with a spicy broth. 
Overall the broth and ramen from what I could remember was average. Not the worst, but probably would not come back here."}
{"text":"Since I liked Posh's ramen, I was looking forward to their opening. Overall rating based on the initial visit is 3.5 stars.

They have two iPad ordering station to customize your order. Easy to order but if you need help, staff is there to assist you.

I ordered Syoyu ramen. I would give 7 out of 10 for broth, I felt like they could use something to make it better. Noodle was pretty good, cooked just right. Soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. Very well made.

For gyoza, first bite, it wasn't cooked right, hard to chew, too dry inside.  Not sure how they could mess up cooking gyoza but they did.

A couple of friends had goma but they said something wasn't right. For those had syoyu agreed with my ratings. (I went with four other guys originally from Japan on this day). 

Lunch portion is small but only $9. So close to my office, I wouldn't be a regular but I would come back again when I am craving for ramen."}
{"text":"Had the sizzling pork ramen and the wife had the Gyoma ramen. Both were spectacular with slurpy hearty flavor and chunks of meat and veggies. I could eat these bowls 3 times a day. Wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Since this used to be Posh ramen on Tuesday night, I like that it's a separate location now. Which means you can go whenever instead of going on only on Tuesday and parking in that crazy condo place where Posh is located. Of course, it's further up in north Scottsdale. The menu is the same as before. I wish they change it a little bit and offer more variety than the 4 ramen that they had. And it is kind of pricey too just like Posh. It's cheaper but you get smaller portions in the new location. But now there's a another ramen place (literally and not just Tuesdays) for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"I was in for lunch on a cold day and the ramen was just what I wanted on that day.  The ordering system takes a little getting used to but it works well.  My goma ramen was a good-sized portion and had lots of great tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. I had the Shoyu ramen and the boyfriend ordered the chicken special ramen. Both were very delicious with great depth of flavor. Each table has two bottles of unique hot sauces, which was awesome because I love my noodles SPICY. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great service. Ramen tastes great. I would recommend more menu options but perfect little hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time if you know what Ramen should taste like! I ordered Vegan Ramen:broth super sweet (tasted they they poured cheap sugar into broth) very few veggies (couple strands of carrot and bean shoots) and no tofu option. My husband ordered the house special (Goma) and was not impressed and we both were super disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are like me, you visited Posh many of times on the Tuesday Night Ramen night and probably got excited to learn that Chef Josh was opening up a ramen place, so you can have that delish ramen every day of the week, not just Tuesday night. So when Hot Noodles Cold Sake was the place picked for November's International Supper Club UYE, I was pretty excited!

When you 1st walk in, you will see the menu on the wall, and Chef Josh was there to help explain things too, and then you put your order in on the IPad, it's pretty user friendly and I was able to get my order in quickly. The inside of the place is modern/retro; I thought it was pretty cool, you can tell that they had fun designing this place, from the light coverings to the bowls. Nicely done.

I went with the Miso Ramen, it had char-sui pork, sweet corn, carrots, butter, nori, bonito, leeks, bean sprouts, scallions, ramen noodles and I added an onsen egg. I had high hopes and really hoped the other reviews I read couldn't be right, but I shouldn't have hoped so high.  My chai-sui pork was ICE COLD, no really it was, and I don't remember it being ice cold at Posh, so I took the ice cold pork and shoved it into the bottom of my bowl hoping to get some warmth added it to, but that was the other problem, the broth was lukewarm on the verge of being cold so it didn't really add heat anything up, in fact I wound up removing the pork all together, just couldn't bring myself to eat cold pork.  The noodles were perfectly cook, but somehow they too had a chill to them, I just don't get it.

Someone within the group ordered some gyoza, and offer us some, and I don't know about you, but I love gyoza, the soft fleshy dough with the warm soft filling inside, well normally its like that, this on the other hand, wasn't the same. They were cardboard stiff, and not in a over fried way, just hard to explain, and the filling was in a small hard ball, it just was odd

I really wanted to like Hot Noodles Cold Sake, and I know they are just a month old, so hopefully these quirks can get worked out and become the bomb ramen that used to be at Tuesday Night Ramen nights at Posh."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my experience here at Hot Noodles and Cold Sake. I think the cost is a little bit much and will choose my noodle dining experiences in the future wisely, as there are other noodle choices. Honestly though, flavor wise, this one is the best choice - in my opinion. The ordering kiosk is a terrible idea that was probably chosen so that they could run on just the kitchen staff alone. That's fine, but it's weird, even though the kitchen staff will help you. The kitchen staff also will explain everything for you if you've never been in. We went in late, and were the only people in there, mostly because of the time I'm sure. Definitely not a sign of a poor dining choice. Our ramen was made to order and it was phenomenal. The only negative thing is the cost. Two of us in total cost us $50. That includes tip and tax and food. We didn't order anything extra, just an average meal/amount of food for two. I'm thinking I'd be much more likely to go if it was $35? I'm also going to note that the sake I drank was amazing. I even had a sample of a sample that they had - also amazing. It's definitely not the hot stuff that gets run through a machine. Go cold with sake, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"amazing! atmosphere is great! When you walk in a \"ramen ambassador\" helps you with ordering amd what to choose. lucky for us it was chef Josh. so exciting and fun to interact with him. their sake selection is well chosen and varied in price/grade. plus their house wine is AZ and $8/glass. I love the AZ support and it's delicious. the noodles were perfect. the flavors were balanced amd the broth was complicated without being too rich. bonus the food came out really fast! (I'm always starving so this is really important to me)

in general, a great noodle shop!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the complaints are on about. Service was quick to greet and serve.  Had the Miso, soup was good and the noodles just the right texture. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A new eatery with tons of potential. Simple menu focused on steaming bowls of ramen soup. So many excellent tastes that, with a little tweaking, would make this a 5 star eatery. 

The two electronic tablets poised to take your order are cool and the server walks you through the process (and overall, the service is truly 5 star).  However, the hand scrawled \"Order Here\" side placed between the tablets has got to be replaced. 

The Domen ramen house special was a piece of art with tender char sui pork (thankfully with none of that icky red food coloring), toothy-tender ramen, lovely peppers (but please remove the seeds and membranes from the red half pepper next time), bean sprouts in a bowl of pork broth and topped with bonito flakes. Slightly under seasoned and flat, the broth blossomed to perfect porky goodness with the addition of a tablespoon of soy sauce. 

The side of pickled vegetables was a delicious crunchy add-on, I just wish there were more of them!

Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ from HI, I've been seeking a good Ramen place. So far I have not had much luck. This place had a decent menu. Howerver, you must place the order yourself from one of two screens available.

I had the Goma, wick looked nice, but not much flavor to the broth or the char siu. It also had some extra peppers in it, which in my opinion does not go well with ramen.

Also ordered the gyoza, which also looked decent but was a bit over cooked, and without much flavor.

Lastly I made the mistake of adding a 20% tip when placing the order and pre-paying, not realizing we were not going to be served. Overall, it's a bit over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Had this location bookmarked and decided to give it a try when family is town for the holidays.  A little pricey but the food was good.  The gentleman who greeted us was very helpful."}
{"text":"So much potential but this restaurant is like a kid running with their laces untied.

The decor and service are everything you should expect from a Scottsdale dining place.  Clean, open kitchen.  Sleek ordering on an iPad.  The first stumble, however, is the iPads themselves.  The hostess already has to guide you through the menu and now they have to guide you through the iPad.  All the items have pictures to match on the iPad except the specials which fade into the ether by their obscure titles void of pics.  I don't get it.  With this much coaching, wouldn't it just be easier to set the whole thing up as a QRS (Quick, Ready, Serve) concept like  Cold Stone or Chipotle.   The iPad doesn't enhance the experience or food.

Which brings me to the food....
Basically, this is a ramen noodle joint.  Way, way better than your grocery store, college dorm standards.  These high-end ramen shacks litter SF, NYC and D.C., with variable success.  The best ones keep the options lean and make their success on the broth and fun vibe.  As we do at most places we review, we shotgunned the menu.  I don't know if the owners will read this but if they do, please take the comments seriously as you are sitting on a gold mine of potential but are running out of tools.  So let's get to work:

1. Shishito pepper appetizers - weak, absolutely weak.  Not offensive.  Just weak.  They are under roasted and just dousing them with unadorned soy sauce is lazy.  This dish could be improved by mixing some sesame oil into the soy sauce and either deep frying, without batter, in rice oil or browning the skins a bit.  It lacks the classic toastiness that so many places offer.
2. Edamame beans steamed in their pods - less than weak. Cold.  Again, not offensive. Just boring and cold.  They have the requisite flavor but nature did that.  The restaurant fails to build on it.  Come on!!!  How about using some of your table 7-pot sauce, mixing it with peanut oil and tossing the beans?  How about some sea salt?  How about sending someone to Trader Joe's and letting the frozen section do your job?  Edamame is boring.  Make it better.
3. Ramen bowls - ok, here is where they shine.  We ordered the Miso and Goma as recommended by the chef.  The miso has a beautifully deep flavor without being too heavy in the seaweed flavor or salt.  The Goma has a meatier flavor that, frankly, I would like to have the flavors deepened further.  In both bowls, the ramen noodles were cooked to perfection with an al dente texture that grabs the flavors.  The hot broth is artfully balanced by the crisp, cool flavors of firm sprouts.  The cured pork strips in both bowls were welcome but needed a smokier flavor or a char.  And like other reviewers, I agree that if large strips of red peppers and shishito peppers are going to be used, take the time to remove the seeds for the broth.

In all, as is, the place is just average.  The food wasn't fast, so doesn't fit the category of grab-n-go lunch.  The flavors weren't polished enough to make this a destination worth raving about.  And the prices are too high for the total experience that you retain.  Simple changes can turn this place around.  Keep your eye on Hot Noodles and Cold Sake.  If the owners and chefs can make the necessary changes, this is a great concept."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I've just got back from the past month in Tokyo and can tell you that if you want an authentic experience, this is likely as close as you will come to it in the states. You get to order your favorite type of ramen and add in any extras you like. The price is reasonable and affordable for what you're getting which is authenticity. If you're looking for something someone has taken their time on,and instilled with excellence you will love the resturant.

The customer service is likewise top notch and isn't overbearing. They made suggestions that complimented my meal even let me order extra noodles halfway through my bowl without having to get up to go back to the machine. The sake is fantastic and the beer list is very robust. Please give them a chance, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The concept of ordering your food is kiosk-style but it was kind of confusing so the workers helped us about a little bit on how it works. Since it was a self-ordering system, I wasn't sure if I was able to add toppings to my ramen since it didn't indicate an option for that, although I hoped I was able to since I love extra toppings when it comes to my ramen bowls. My ramen overall was delicious; the broth had a lot of flavoring in it, and including their special hot sauce added such a nice kick to it! This little hole in the wall is the perfect place to stop by if you're in the area and are craving for some ramen!"}
{"text":"Both broths tasted were beyond delicious and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Only potential downside is the food is a little pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"\"What you see is what you get\".... is what was mumbled to my friend and I when we got our two overpriced, far from satisfying bowls of ramen. Not to mention they aren't serving alcohol for the first few weeks of being open, I'm sure you're aware that SAKE IS IN THE NAME OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT... After getting our bowls of ramen while trying to stay optimistic, they don't have salt or pepper at the tables or Sriracha, we had to borrow that from the cook and return it after we got our desired amount of spice. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if they don't lower their prices this Ramen spot that tried to jump on the ramen trend will go out of business... I'm sorry for anyone that steps foot into this place which is sad because ramen is hard to mess up... Another thing that's interesting, this place is self serve and they carry $150 dollar bottles of Sake? Makes zero sense why his ramen shop would offer that, they're dinning area doesn't exactly go hand and hand with that kind of price point or maybe it does i don't know...

Wish there was a half star... Oh yeah, almost forgot you have to pay extra for a boiled egg......... SMH did I really just pay $20 for a bowl of ramen?"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch and I had seafood broth noodles soup, it was excellent!

You order and pay on IPad, yes very hi-tech but if you confuse how to order like I did, the waiter is more than happy to help.

This little place is very cozy and friendly.

The only negative part is that you pay extra $4 if you want to add egg, green chili peppers and other options on the screen."}
{"text":"Not very good. Interesting idea but food was not very good. Gyoza were ok. Broth was completely bland.  Noodles had an unpleasant chewy texture, may have been undercooked."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time today and it was delicious. Definitely recommend giving them a try. The broth is amazing. I'll try more varieties of their offerings prior to posting meal specific."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for sometime now and I finally got a chance to go in and check it out. YUM!! It's a perfect stop in for lunch and the shrimp ramen is delicious!! I wasn't a fan of the green tea in a can, but I didn't come for the tea so who cares! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"More than ten years ago, my wife and I were in Tokyo, Japan. After spending most of a night and morning at the massive fish market, we stumbled into a \"restaurant\" the catered only to the locals and that served ramen noodles. We had to wait for a seat. As we left, we could only rave to each other about that being the best ramen we've ever tasted. It was magnificent!

Since that time, we've had nothing that even came close to that memorable experience ... until last night that is. \"Hot Noodles and Cold Saki\" in the shopping center near Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101 blew us away. The ramen was absolutely great. Rich, flavorful and full of character, I've had none better.

I had the miso ramen while my partner had the lobster ramen. Both were delectable.

The restaurant is small with only five or six tables and five seats at the counter. It's designed with efficiency in mind. Customers place their own orders on computer screens when they enter and meals are quickly brought to their tables.

If you're up for a quick, nourishing and incredibly delicious ramen meal, you don't need to look any further than this. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  A true find.  My first time visiting after being influenced to have ramen noodles from the Netflix show Chefs Table.  Would highly recommend.  The staff are fun, informative, and very personable."}
{"text":"Hot Noodles Cold Sake is the perfect place to get quality ramen in a fast casual setting.You have several ramen options, a few apps to pick from, and will get your food in minutes.  What's even better is that you can tell the quality of their food products has been taken into careful consideration, so everything is fresh and is made to order.

I ordered the Goma ramen (with pork) and I added a poached egg to it, which gave my ramen a super silky consistency.  The ramen was beautifully seasoned, the pork was incredibly tender, and there was more than enough food that I had leftovers to go and enjoy the next day for lunch.

If you are curious about ramen, definitely come and check this place out.  I will definitely come back and try out another bowl!  :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best noodles I have had in town and the broth was amazing, while the ingredients are rich and layered with flavors.  Some spicy some mild, part cold and part hot.  Great find."}
{"text":"I just came back from lunch here today. It was delicious. I have had ramen night a Posh a few times and I think this is definitely as good. I think that the kinks that other diners had experienced have been worked out. The broth was great, lots of toppings."}
{"text":"Literally the best noodles I've had ...the shop is small and intimate plus the staff is very helpful!! also I absolutely love the ordering process it's so efficient y'all deff need to show your face around here !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Quality ingredients and you definitely get what you pay for here.  Hoping Josh will open more of these because this city lacks places like this."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Impersonal service. The vegan broth is sweet as candy. No one came by to see if we liked our food. We walked out leaving two full bowls of ramen after having paid $34 upfront. They didn't notice."}
{"text":"Wifey and I wanted to give this new place a shot. Yikes!Prices are pretty steep for what you order. We ordered the Shoyu and it was just okay. It could be because we literally just got back from Tokyo a week ago so this just pales in comparison. Food is not that expensive in Tokyo for cheap eats so I just felt a bit robbed especially with no added toppings. I did not feel any desire to finish the broth"}
{"text":"As a ramen lover, I got to try it once even some of the reviews are not as great. Their ramen looked good in the pictures and I told myself it can't be that bad. Well, I was wrong, all items were way over priced, $4 for just little bit of extra noodles. A bowl of ramen easily double the price of true authentic \"Ramen Satouka\" at Mitsuwa marketplace Torrance,CA. And the soup broth didn't taste right. Gome-House soup tasted okay but Shoyu just plain wrong. I am not even trying to compare them with the ramen places that I visited in Japan.

Save yourself some money, just cook some instant noodle at home instead."}
{"text":"If you like ramen, then this is the place you should try.  Josh, the chef, spent a great deal of time in Japan and knows the fine details of this special dish.  He'll give you a great education on the subject along with one of the finest ramen meals you will likely have ever had.  They have several different types, and all broths and noodles are made from scratch.  Go!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5
Happiness - 4/5

This is a no muss, no fuss, get your ramen quick, hot, and easy place. You order on an iPad, which I like. Many reviewers have criticized this place for the ordering system, but it is convenient and the future (Meep morp!). Also, when I walked in, an employee was standing there to welcome me, explain the menu, and explain the ordering system (and did so throughout my meal to other guests).

I agree that the place is a bit pricey (lots of add-ons). The Happy Hour makes the sake and beers a good price, but otherwise, I'd pass due to the expense). I had a fantastic, translucent, runny egg added into my chicken ramen that I would add on again (never had that before, typically the eggs I get in ramen are more along the pickled/hard boiled variety). The meat was good, and the broth was very good. There was also a hot sauce they had that was to die for (and to use conservatively). But it gets dinged due to the noodles. They tasted a bit gummy and bland - very reminiscent of higher-end ramen packages at grocery stores. That's such a shame given that all the other ingredients were really tasty. And since noodles are kind of the biggest part of ramen, it gets a lower score. 

Still, it really hit the spot on a windy day and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"So happy that Scottsdale has finally had an authentic ramen place!  I went there for the second time and really liked their food.  Broth and ramen are two key ingredients and they do a very good job on both!  This shop has just opened for one month and they are working on  smoother operation during busy hours.  However, the food quality stands out.  My family and myself are a little bit of ramen snobs and fans as we get most of our ramen in Japan and other Asian countries.  This place is a gem!!!  I had tried Miso and Goma ramen, broth is fantastic!  The boiled egg is cooked in perfection and the char-su (or tongatsu) are tender and flavorful.  I would only hope that they could be a little generous on the meat portion.  Otherwise, we are very pleased and satisfied.  I also love Pho, but, I, now, would chose ramen over Pho at Hot Noodles Cold Sake!

Keep up the good work and all the best!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, I was kind of getting excited as it is a new place in Scottsdale for a ramen joint to open up and honestly, I'm not so sure why the ramen joints here in Phoenix all have the same similarity - Not great! :-(
Coming from Hawaii, I understand now, we are super spoiled! Its like we don't want to be to picky but, it's difficult when you come from having quality vs quantity! 
My family and I came in last night 30 minutes before they were closing, I like the décor, having the menu on the wall, and the two little iPads where you need to place your order (sorta reminds me of Genki Sushi in Ala Moana Center). But, just an fyi you don't need to leave a 20% gratuity because they do not serve or bring it to table, you can probably tip just a few dollars, not a whole lot.
I had the Goma - House speciality and it wasn't that great at all. The broth, it was missing some flavors, didn't care for the peppers in our ramen and the cured egg was not tasty at all. It was marinated with  some kind of sweet sauce and it was really cold, makes you wonder how can a warm broth have something cold in it. I couldn't eat it! The noodles wasnt anything excited, it was like it came from a package and separated in the broth. The char siu was definitely a disappointment very dry, no taste :-(
For appetizers we had the gyoza, my first bite into I thought I was eating sausage spaghetti. It was not your ordinary gyoza! All in all, it was like a asian joint mixed with Mexican cuisine. 
I guess we will either start making our own ramen at home or continue onto our quest to find delicious ramen in a Arizona!"}
{"text":"Little place located in a strip mall. Decor is cute and woman at the front is friendly and does her best at explaining the food and ordering system. The food is adequate, but nothing special. There are much better ramen shops in the valley."}
{"text":"I really would've loved to have an awesome ramen spot next to my work, but based on the ramen I had I will not be coming back.

The restaurant is very small but modern. I liked the chalkboard menu and the self service tablets. I think they're still trying to figure out the system, because we didn't get our sodas until they asked us if we wanted water.

We ordered Gyoza to start. First thing I noticed that was off was the price for the portion size. As you can see we got 4 tiny pieces for $7. The wrapping was just strange. It was really hard like melted plastic and the meat was pretty dry. My friend ordered the house ramen and I ordered the shrimp. It was so disappointing. The broth for both of ours was way too fishy and gamey smelling, almost sickeningly so, and my friend didn't even have fish in his bowl.Their was only 3 shrimp, and 2 calamari rings in my small bowl. Also, there was no veggies only a few scallions and a piece of seaweed. I could taste nothing but that fish market smell. The noodles were plentiful but bland and not fresh.  First time I've scowled at food in awhile."}
{"text":"Love this Place!!!  It's the best we have in the area!  The noodles are fresh!  The soup is flavorful.  I've only it take out so far the inside seating is small.  I think it will keep on getting better as time goes on."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, really enjoyed it on my lunch break. Food was quick, small but cozy. Would recommend for a quick and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"This ramen place is very nice. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and very relaxing. I came on a Friday evening and there was only me and another person, so that was nice. The waiter was very nice and friendly and showed me how to order. I ordered the goma ramen. It is a bit on the salty side but it wasn't so salty that I couldn't eat it anymore. However, it was spicer than I expected. I had expressed to the waiter that I don't do spicy foods and he still recommend this and just said \"don't bite into the peppers\", but I still found it to be too spicy for me. So, if you're like me try the shoyu ramen instead! Overall a cute place, good food, and nice people!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a good bowl of ramen in Phoenix is like trying to find a needle in a haystack... damn near impossible. HNCS is the nearest ramen restaurant to our house so we decided to give it a shot... as expected, we didn't care much for it. Prices were pretty high for what we got. I was very disappointed in their \"signature\" bowl. Being that it's their star, it should really shine a little more. We likely won't be back. Maybe we went on a fluke night, hopefully you'll have better luck!"}
{"text":"TLDR:
Anyways, it's a very nice place with good atmosphere and appears to be quite clean. The ramen stands out as the best I've had in a while and I'll be back.


-----------
I am so happy I've finally found a good ramen place!  I've been to so many bad ramen places in the area with mixed results I was beginning to question if I even liked ramen.

When my friend and I arrived we were greeted and introduced to their simple menu. The serve 'ramen' but with a lot of verity.

You enter your order into a little touch kiosk which may turn off some people but I think it's almost authentic considering you face a similar challenges in Japan. ( so my friend tells me )

The ramen itself was great. The broth seemed to reach me expectations after I've been disappointed by both bland and cold broth in other places."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but too many issues kept me from going higher than a two. First off, I'll say the food is actually more akin to traditional ramen than other places I've been and I think their rating can rise with some easy changes.

The broth was barely warm and the meat was cold. All of our meat... All four of us. After submerging the cold ingredients in the ramen for a time they were actually good but paying ~$13 for a entree as cold as the beer that came with it is unacceptable. While my beer came out relatively quick, waters were difficult to acquire and refills were as well. The gyoza appeared to be hamburger meat that was a tad bit overdone and was not worth it

Overall I was disappointed but more staff and heating up the food would give this place to more stars."}
{"text":"Came on opening night. Ordered a goma ramen and a shoyu ramen.  Solid, not excellent ramen. The broth outshone the noodles. More comprehensive review to come."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been coming here for a while and ramen is consistently delicious. Not too many ramen spots in the area and this one does it right!"}
{"text":"Another great ramen place in Scottsdale- so happy that the Asian food I crave has finally made its way to the southwest. I never got to try chef Josh's ramen at Posh, but I can only imagine that it was as wonderful as it is here. We got takeout from here earlier this week after a particularly exhausting day. I had the shoyu and my fiancee had the house goma. The egg was perfectly cooked, which happens to be my favorite part! Overall fantastic ramen comparable to the quality we were used to in Seattle. Only knock on the stars would be the location, as it's located in one of my least favorite places in the strip mall mecca, and was a bit hard to find using Waze."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try last night because we like to support our local N Scottsdale businesses. Upon walking in we were greeted and got the full run down of the menu and the ordering process. Your order is placed on an iPad which does make the process a little impersonal. 

I can agree with all the other reviews the food is extremely overpriced. By time we were done with 2 bowls, a glass of wine and a \"can\" of sprite we spent $49. The base price for a dinner Bowl is $13 and to add double noodles is $4!! I advise double noodles otherwise you'll end up with broth and not enough noodles. My opinion they should have a price point of $13 and you can build your own bowl. After all we're talking about soup here. 

Over all the food was great but it's not a place we'll visit again unless the price points change."}
{"text":"Really great place for ramen and a generous amount of food. The steamed pork bun was amazingly delicious. Friendly atmosphere. If it wasn't so far away from my house I woukd come back frequently."}
{"text":"This place should be a $$$.  Never spent $15 on a bowl of ramen at a strip mall before.  The ramen was barely average.  Came out kinda cold.  Haven't found good ramen in scottsdale.  I miss Orange County."}
{"text":"Love this place quite and quick. Yummy Ramen I've had the shrimp seafood and shoyu both really good!! They have a lot of different sale and beef if your looking for a place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"The BF and I really wanted this place to be good. My first visit was actually his second visit. The first visit he found the broth to be okay in flavor but warm and not very hot. He also found his meat and egg to be cold. His first visit was when they first opened, so he was very willing to give it another try in hopes that it has improved. 

We both ordered the shoyu ramen. He added a couple of extras which brought his to a $20 bowl of ramen. Just a little outrageous in price, eh? 

When we got our ramen, he quickly pushed his meat down into the broth in hopes that it would warm the meat. (I'm thinking.... why can't everything just be warmer? We shouldn't have to push the meat down to warm it. It's not pho...) I do the same and you should too if you don't want cold meat and egg. 

Overall the flavor and taste was okay. Not amazing where I want to drink every last drop. Plus it was almost cold by the time I finished. 

I would suggest going somewhere else if you can. Or maybe wait a bit longer to see if things improve before you try it."}
{"text":"Goma Raman is my personal favorite here. The pork is so good. The broth and their house made hot sauces are addictive. Love this place."}
{"text":"Brilliant. Outstanding. A discovery for your taste buds!

Ignore the two recent negative YELP reviews (both suspiciously left within hours of each other). This is one of the best eatery discoveries I've made in 2016! Highest recommendation. 

Located near Grabba Green in a very small location (I used to eat at the middle eastern restaurant which used to be in this spot). The self ordering system is a little odd (touch screen menus and swipe your own card) but a female there introduced herself to me and explained the ordering system and various ramen menu items and appetizers. 

Went here for the first time two days ago. I was not expecting the ramen bowl I ordered to be so rich and delicious! I ordered the house special Ramen bowl. The BBQ'd pork was tantalizingly flavorful- moist and tender, full of layered intricacy. 

The noodles (hot!) were plentiful and the broth was so rich that it really exceeded all expectations. The greens in the ramen and other veggies were just so complex in their flavors that I ate every delicious bite. 

I will be back - often. 

This is a genuine discovery, and I predict culinary success for this delightful little hole in the wall Ramen joint that would be at home in Japan. Excellent."}
{"text":"I've had fair share of ramen. Been to Japan even. Please serve the broth hotter and the chasu would be better if it weren't cold. The price is a bit steep for what you get. I'd eat here every day if it were cheaper and better tasting, but I'm afraid this place won't last unless it ups the ante. Isn't this supposed to be top of the line? The kiosk ordering system is reminiscent of Japan. And the ambiance is nice but a bit Spartan.  I wish this place were awesome, I really do, I'd like to see it succeed because north Scottsdale certainly lacks the culinary variety that this place brings. As it is I might eat here once a month."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just not my thing?   We tried two of the house specialties.  There were literally two little slices of pork on each and they were fatty.  Broth was good but that's all we enjoyed.  It seemed very fishy. Again, maybe it's just not our thing.  Help was very nice and buildout clean and modern.  Definitely a lunch type spot."}
{"text":"The good: The veggie ramen bowl was delicious and the staff were really nice. The hot sauces added a great kick to the broth. There are not many seats but we did not have to wait and got a seat right away so I think we went when it wasn't peak time.

The not so good: The dinner price was a little high, so I'll probably just stick to coming here for lunch. Also, the veggie broth did not have a ton of flavor so had to add the hot sauce to kick it up (which was good)."}
{"text":"We have been 2X: Friday (husband & daughter) + Monday (7 of us), Jan. 2017. While dinners are  ~$18/PP, we have been quite happy. I love the goma/1st item on the Ramen menu/house specialty + pork bits, my husband & daughter love the miso + egg & 2X the noodles. The gyoza is 3-4/5, however I *really* like the cold shrimp steam bun. We will make this a regular stop! We love that it feels authentically Japanese, like we are in Tokyo again!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with their miso. My husband and I pick up take out here a couple times a month. They're quick and friendly. It's a little pricey but the ingredients are high quality and two orders can be easily be stretched to 3 full meals, so it's well worth it to us."}
{"text":"Really expensive. You pay 11+ dollars for Ramen. Most of which doesn't have meat included! It's a 3 dollar up charge for peppers. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg. No option to add meat! Ramen noodle itself was okay, not over cooked or soggy. Don't waste your time or money here go buy yourself some authentic pho. Two in house hot Sauces, identical in taste, not very flavorful. 


Beer is priced at $5 for Kirin light. 

Hope they change their price, and provide more options to spice up the bowl."}
{"text":"Spicy and tasty ramen! Kinda a hole in the wall but maybe they're going for that vibe. A single banner with Batman eating ramen and a television. No decorative plants noted and some Frank Sinatra playing low volume in the background. Not much to order other than ramen and some gyoza or steamed buns. There's a nice friendly waiter that helps new comers with the menu which is on a chalkboard wall but you have to order on an iPad. I ordered the Goma Ramen with pork and shrimp. I also ordered a steamed shrimp bun and the lunch combo came with edamame and a can of cold green tea. Food came quickly and definitely spicy!  Veggies were crunchy and tasted very fresh. 
I'd probably give it 4.5 stars cause the ambience wasn't quite cohesive but the ramen was the best I've tasted in the valley and so I'll round up due to the awesome food."}
{"text":"As ramen addicts, we are constantly dreaming about ramen and were very excited to hear the Chef from Posh was going to open his own free standing ramen after running a weekly ramen night for the past few years.

The location is a little difficult to find as the shopping center is hard to navigate.  The restaurant is located on the NE side of the center next to Skeptical Chymist.  The restaurant is small and maybe sits 30-40 people including the bar/rail seating.  The ordering system takes some time to get used to.  You order everything, I mean everything through the POS terminal at the front of the house and a server brings you the items as they come up.  It's a fun concept except if you want a refill, you have to wait in line to reorder instead of just being able to order it through a server.  

We had helped with the Kickstarter for the restaurant and had a voucher for 2 bowls of ramen with complementary add ons. I ordered Shoyu with Pork Cracklings and Extra Char Sui and The Boy got the Goma House Specialty with pork cracklings and cured egg.  The broth itself was very good but arrived warm and we had the same issue as other Yelper's with the rest of the items in the broth being cold.  My Char Sui was delicious but was cold as if it had just been taken from the fridge.  The chef was nice enough to send us complimentary Gyoza but it again disappointed.  The wrapper was tough and chewy as was the filling.

Overall, the ramen was very good but between the distance to get here and the price of the dishes (our bowls were $18-19 each with the add ons) it makes it a little difficult to become a regular here.  Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I was headed to Rubio's and veered to the side of the unknown. There was no sign up, telling me this was a new spot; Yelp confirmed. They are running a small show in here but it's cozy and fairly efficient. They utilize a self-ordering system with iPads at the help of what I assumed was the owner. Unfortunately I was on lunch break from work and could not enjoy one of the many adult beverages they have available. Food took about 10 minutes to come out and I was upset that I didn't snap a photo to share, but it was delish! And prepared very nicely. The cost was a little high for my blood, this would really make me hesitate to go back. My meal was about $20... if my wife knew, she would kill me. 

Likes: 

Few Options - I find this impressive because they are mastering what they are doing. It's not an overwhelming, cumbersome mess like Cheesecake factory. The menu is ramen, with your choice of preparation, a few sides and water, coke or diet coke. Simple, and delicious. 

Dislikes:

Ordering system is something to get used to and it's very impersonal. The owner seems very involved in the business and is very helpful so I think it would be better for him to take orders to make the experience more memorable. Put a face to your place. I also think that in a rush this would be a catastrophe because people are not used to it. So really you are placing the orders for the customers, but just running back and forth lol. It was not that big of a deal because it was simple and i think everyone knows how to use an iPad. It might take my parents a few more minutes to figure it out. But with the minimum wage increases I feel this is the way of the future. 

Overall:

I would return, but not often because of the price. This would be an occasion type place, not a \"go-to\". Or if I had me a hankerin' for ramen. Service was good, no complaints. Atmosphere was good. I am excited to see how this place evolves once a customer base is established.

Thanks."}
{"text":"Most arguably my new favorite ramen shop. Got the goma house speciality on recommendation from the chef and was not disappointed. The pork was so tender that you could cut it with one chopstick. The broth was things made in dreams. The steamed bun with shrimp is amazing if not a little expensive for one. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! While unassuming from the outside, this Ramen restaurant will blow you away once the food is put in front of you.

There are a handful of Ramen restaurants spread throughout the valley, and it's been a relatively tough task to find one that stands out. Some of them are passable or even venture into the 'good' territory, but having tried some of the best Ramen stops in NYC, LA, and SF, it is just tough to compare. 

Hot Noodles, Cold Sake really stands out in a number of ways, all contributing to why you need to give it a try. First and most important are the number of from-scratch components used in the Ramen. I'd recommend speaking to the staff, as I did, to learn about the time and labor put into their food. Their knowledge was extensive and I learned a few things about the food and sake. Second is the aroma and flavor. I've had the Goma House specialty (twice!) and tried the Shoyu, the Goma being my absolute favorite. Just the broth alone is incredible! The noodles are absolutely perfect, cooked to the texture a Ramen pro would be looking for. Though the bowl contains a great variety of items, I'd suggest adding an Onsen Egg for an extra dash of savory.

As you're aware, I'm a fan. I'd like to quickly address some of the neutral or negative reviews with regard to price and sitting room. For price, you cannot compare it to the notion of packaged ramen, since this is anything but. A better way to compare is to put it against what you would spend at another Japanese restaurant (e.g. Sushi) and you'll find there is actually a lot of value in the food you get here. Other notable Ramen restaurants charge as much as 50% more for their bowls. For sitting room, this place is great for groups of 2/4, though it does get tough to find a place to sit during the busier hours. I would suggest waiting for a table than taking anything to go, since you want your food as fresh and hot, considering the nature of this food. This is only a small price to pay for the other great features of this place.

Check out Hot Noodles if you haven't already. It's worth a shot for what I now consider the best Ramen in town!"}
{"text":"It's my second time here and I'll definitely keep coming back! Their noodles are amazing! The broth is very rich and flavorful, the cured eggs are cooked to perfection and the pork is unbelievable! I recommend start with the gyoza and then having the \"Shoyu\" ramen. The staff is great and the environment is very clean and nice, the songs playing on the background are diversified and in a perfect volume, so you can have a nice conversation without yelling at the person sitting right in front of you."}
{"text":"The ramen noodles were undercooked and the gyoza did not have a good flavor. I did have the steamed bun and it tasted like a take on the Peking duck bun and it was pretty good.  The ramen was also supposed to have char siu pork, but it tasted more like just pork with no char siu flavor.   The Bonito flakes were not flakes.  They were big shavings and a little too big for the amount of broth that was in the bowl.  I don't think we'll be eating here again.  Too bad because we were hoping for good ramen.  It's also completely overpriced at $13 a bowl. I'd be better off having a packet of ramen at home for 20 cents."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear about a new ramen place near me and wanted to share that it's delicious! 

Pros:
Big portions, decent pricing, and fast service. 

Cons:
The shoshito pepper starter was a bit overpriced I think. Smaller than expected. 

I ate the Shoyu and added egg and pork. It was very filling. Plenty of noodles, tasty broth, the eggs were just right and it left no room for desert. 

My fiancee got the house special the Goma. It had plenty of spiciness to it and there was no need to add additional sauce.

Tl;dr check it out if you like ramen"}
{"text":"We ordered a he steamed buns and the shoyu noodles and they were both amazing.
The restaurant is setup just like the noodle restaurants in Japan so you will need to place your order on a touchscreen computer.
It was the best ramen we ever had!
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a little over a year and I've gone in a couple of times. I would give them three and a half stars and I wish Yelp would start allowing people to give half Stars so the reviews would be more accurate. All in all the food here is good sometimes the broth is a little too salty. I have had many different Romans around the country including Little Tokyo in Los Angeles where I find they make the best in the country. This place definitely does a good job for Arizona and the chef slash owner takes his food seriously. A little pricey in my opinion but is not much competition in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, really, inexpensive in a very tiny and casual environment. Fresh ingredients, delicious broth, Loved the seafood dish. Brian very helpful. Best noodle place in Phoenix. Wish it was closer to the central Phoenix but definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"As far as north Scottsdale goes, this is defiantly one of my favorite ramen places now. I especially liked it since they have a vegan option for my friend to splurge on. The noodles were great and the meat was excellent. I loved the Shoyu ramen broth and would recommend others trying it if they like a more traditional ramen flavor.This specific dish even includes the egg free of charge but the other options you need to pay for an egg since it's specifically not apart of the ingredients in the bowl. The waiter and staff were very polite too."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this ramen house to me so being that I love ramen I had to try it. You order and pay when you walk in and there was someone there to help you order if you need it.

I ordered the gyoza and the Goma House ramen. They were both good. The ramen had plenty of toppings and a tasty broth. I would order both again.

If you like ramen I would definitely give them a shot. It might just be your new favorite place."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Josh Hebert's Posh, so we were excited when he told us off this new venture. We read a lot of the reviews here just before going and wondered how anything cooked by Josh could warrant fewer than four stars. Complaints about the chef not greeting them are borderline ridiculous and we found our broth to be plenty hot. Ignore the haters and go enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, and I am beyond disappointed in what our experience was. The gentleman who greeted us was great and explained everything to us and how the kiosk worked and even helped us. We ordered two different types. The noodles were so Al Dente that they were chewy  and sticky and both the broth's just lacked of flavor. I'm not going back or recommending to friends."}
{"text":"The chef/owner has created a very authentic and delicious menu of Japanese ramen and accompaniments. Excellent beer and sake selection with a very nice happy hour, too."}

Ramen Restaurant finally in North Scottsdale! 

Unfortunately, did not meet any expectations what so ever.

Ordered the Ramen Goma House Specialty with Onsen Egg and Pork Gyoza.

When I have Ramen, the broth is the first thing that has to impress, the broth was filled with pepper where it was difficult to savor any flavor. Generally the soup broth could almost live by properly prepared Char Sui Pork and Bok Choy. The Char Sui had no taste and there was one small piece of Bok Choy.  All you could taste is a salty broth filled with pepper that makes you cough with every spoon of broth. 

We also had the Pork Gyozas and the taste of the pork was almost ransid. Their were 5 gyozas to the order and the size were average to small.

The ordering as you come in on the IPad is different , innovative and impersonal. As a service business to put an iPad in front to greet you is not the type of people personal touch I expect in a restaurant, in fact who are you tipping for service when at the end of the iPad gives you a choice of what percent tip you want to add? I may just go to the vending machines in Walmart to get dinner.

I really wanted to like this restaurant and hope that finally there is a Ramen Restaurant in North Scottsdale, there is, but it is not for me. 

Bottom line is when your restaurant is based on Ramen, you would think they have a product that is going to back it up. Don't believe the Asians are going to flock to this place, maybe the pretty people will endure for a little bit but my wife said \"This place is not going to last\" which I give it less than a year if changes are not made.

I will travel to Chandler 20 miles away to have Ramen than come here again."}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually like this place a lot more than Posh's ramen night (mediocre in my opinion). I've visited several times because it is very conveniently located for me. The broth has a lot of bonito and is rather smoky and peppery, which I personally like, but I can see why some people might not. I really enjoyed both the goma and the miso bowls. The soy cured egg is one of the best ones I've had in AZ. 

My biggest complaint is that the service has been rather slow on every one of my visits."}
{"text":"Returned as promised.  I was lucky enough to be invited to a private dinner for 20 this week.  Chef Josh personally took most orders and prepared every single bowl of ramen served.  

If you take a moment to read my previous review, you will see how my first experience went and why going back again for seconds is advisable!

Since this was one of the kickstarter meals that HNCS sold prior to opening, I got to try almost every appetizer, if not all of them.

I ordered my favorite Posh Ramen, Goma.  It is normally $13 a bowl.  I must say, even when I went on Ramen Nights at Posh, the following statement is true:  when chef Josh makes the ramen, it simply tastes better to me.  No different than my preference for a dish my mom makes that follows my grandmom's recipe.  I could have licked my bowl the broth was so deeply flavored and delicious.  The bowl was delivered to me piping hot.  I even ate a lot of the noodles which is something I usually skip to save calories(gotta save some kinda way).  This was the ramen I loved!  I can't wait to go up there again.  Good Job!
