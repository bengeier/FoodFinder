{"text":"OMG!  Without a doubt, the closest thing to authentic Naples pizza you will find in this city.  I will say this, get there early! Oh yes and get there early if you want a table. There are only about 10 or so.  Fresh carved cheese. Fresh herbs. Amazing crust. Authentic Italian oven. Great friendly personal service by the owners.  My hubby and I ordered \"The 10\" and \"La Testarossa\" both were amazing!  My hubby asked for chocolate gelato, being a chocolate and ice cream fiend. He loved it. So creamy and deeply chocolatey.  What are you waiting for, go now!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious pizza, good prices.  Run by the same folks as la Luna Rossa but more affordable and approachable for the younger crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas! The crust is thin, crispy and chewy. Perfect toppings. The restaurant itself is small and reservations are highly recommended if you're going for dinner. We came for lunch and it was easy to get a table for four. Don't miss out on the tiramisu for dessert. Very tasty and has that homemade Italian taste. I don't dine out for pizza often but I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The pizzas are fabulous! Simple but fabulous! It's a family owned restaurant with lovely owners who enjoy serving you. From time to time they make some traditional Italian desserts that they offer... Don't say no! You won't regret it ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for pizza. The ingredients are super fresh. I saw the owner shave the cheese and meat for my pie. The crust is stellar. Just the right thickness and with a pleasant crunch for happy chomping.   Prices are very reasonable, cheaper than other pizzerias in Calgary but higher in quality. The only thing is that there are few seats, so it can be challenging to go with friends. If you're lucky you can get a small table. If you haven't been, this is one gem you ought to check out."}
{"text":"The Pizza was fantastic! This tiny restaurant only sits 22 people, but what it lacks in space makes up for in heart. Simple, clean decor with an abbreviated menu to match. A few starters, the list of traditional Italian pizzas, and a few desserts that are homemade and amazing. We decided to have the margarita and one called the 10, which had prosciutto and arugula .  Thin charred crust , perfectly done. We started with a simple salad, which I prefer , rather than those that everything in them, from goat cheese to nuts to blah , blah , blah and before you know it it's a 4000 calorie salad!  For dessert we had a chocolate fudge cake , that tasted light as a feather, moist and left you wanting more, despite it being a perfect portion size . We also had the apple ricotta crostata that was also delightful .  They have wine and beer. Short list but good quality . The prices were reasonable and the portions were just right. There is ample parking. Give this place a try, you'll be happy you did !"}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in Calgary no doubt! Seriously one of the best pizzas I've had since having \"legit\" pizza in Naples.   Tried a couple of different pizzas here but my favourite is The 10. The prosciutto is soo good, seriously! They don't cheap out on the toppings either - they put so much cheese and prosciutto on that we couldn't even see the sauce haha. The dough is thin and delicious and the sauce tastes super fresh and authentic.  The desserts here are awesome as well - one of the best tiramisus! They have some other desserts that they serve and switch up but if you have to pick just one, I recommend the tiramisu :)  I almost didn't want to write a review for this place because it's a cozy little place with a limited amount of seats but I felt too guilty to not share the best pizzeria in town.. If you are planning on trying this place (especially on a weekend), call ahead of time and make resos to not be disappointed!  Service here is really great as well - we've only been twice but the owner recognized us on the second visit. Friendly and casual atmosphere, love this place!"}
{"text":"Small authentic Italian pizza place. Pizzas were great and service was fantastic. Had the Capricciosa, Sausage pizza and tre colori salad to share. I would highly recommend this place. Very small though, I would make a reservation! I can't wait to go back, they ran out of Tiramisu which they are famous for!"}
{"text":"I love  Azzurri Pizzeria the problem is I don't want anyone else to try it because they would as well . The problem is there isn't a lot of seating even though they have a patio now . The pizza is meravigliosa cooked in special fancy pizza oven . The pizza is a thin crust but soooooo tasty with the perfect amount of crunch on the bottom . Drinks are delicious and fun . You feel like your part of the family when your there most likely because all staff is a family ? Great place"}
{"text":"It'd been a long time since I'd been treated to a meal so good that I wanted to give the chef a hug on my way out the door, but such was the giddy, emotional rush after finishing La Testarosa at Azzurri. There was simply nothing about the meal that I wanted to change.  If you love pizza, but are doubting the gushingly positive Yelp assessment, please, please, per favore let me convince you to give Azzurri a try.  Reservations? A same-day request was taken and honored cheerfully. (There was even a charming little table tent, marking the reserved spot).  Is the freshness all that everyone else is glowing about? In a word: Yes. In a few words: Half of the fun is literally watching your pizza being crafted from scratch and fired in the oven. The dough will be stretched, and the toppings placed, by a practiced hand. You'll know it's the real deal, even before (but especially after) the first bite.  So there's great food but lacking ambiance, right? Hardly. While this small pizzeria isn't unapproachably formal at all, the restaurant carries itself with pride. There wasn't a disappointed or sullen face in the entirety of the house. Instead, expect an infectious conviviality from the hosts and a general sense of confident anticipation as guests (myself especially) watch pizza after pizza arrive perfectly from the kitchen. The clientele feel like a family, and it's one that you'll be a part of when you step in the door. It's not just the oven that throws off warmth.  You can't help but say \"Ciao\" after dining, and it will be the most honest, content thing that you say that day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and snagged the last table available in this quaint restaurant. For the last year and a half I have been bugging him about finding wood-fired pizza because he thought, \"pizza is pizza.\" FINALLY!! This is the real deal, better than Naples, Neapolitan pizza. If you haven't been here, I highly suggest putting it on your agenda!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is that of a cafe or intimate restaurant due to it's small size, large windows and open kitchen. I believe the owners (and their family) run the restaurant and they are friendly and welcoming. The pizzas we had were absolutely amazing, we managed to split 2 between two people and we left feeling comfortably full. We had lunch there and it wasn't overly busy, however, our host recommended we make reservations for dinner as it tends to be busier in the evening. I highly recommend this place and although the regular menu is small, the pizza is great and the weekly features will surely never leave you bored."}
