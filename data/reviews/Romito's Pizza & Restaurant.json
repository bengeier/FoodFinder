{"text":"I worked at Romitos when I was in high school.  The dinners and pizza are sooooooo good.  I worked with the one the original menu creators and the recipes are original and authentic.  It is a very laid back and casual place to enjoy friends and family.  The price is just right as well. Bravo!!"}

{"text":"One of the best lunch deals in town....  All you can eat pizza buffet with salad and a drink for under $6!   This is a small, family owned dive restaurant in an older building in a small strip mall. The service is always decent and the pizza is as well. The buffet theme and value make it a popular locale for folks on their lunch break.   Recently, they've been creating some funky pizzas for the buffet. Some of their selections include Buffalo Bleu Chicken Pizza, Alfredo Pizza, BLT Pizza, Mashed Potato Pizza with Corn and Fried Chicken, dessert pizza's consisting of peanut butter and chocolate as well as peanut butter and jelly pizza, along with many others. They certainly get an A for creativity!"}
{"text":"Typical cheap pizza. Tomato sauce is uneventful. OK, but nothing really special."}
