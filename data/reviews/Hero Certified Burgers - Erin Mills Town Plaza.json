{"text":"All I have to say this is a GOOD burger!!! Lets get down to logistics:

The location: very well located, it has Erinmills mall beside it.

The restaurant: is quite small, that can seat around 20 to 25 people. The was clean, when I was there.

The staff: I was reading some reviews and it stated that the customer service was not good. But I had it otherwise, may be because I was severed by the franchise owner. The reason I say that is because she had her work schedule and laptop beside our table. She was very friendly and when I told her we want to dine in she stated you are welcome and was very friendly, nice and quick to execute.

Parking: Plenty of parking as its in a plaza

The Food: I had their 4oz burger with egg. The burger is juicy, not over cooked and the bun can hold the burger without breaking apart. The taste of the meat is nice and you don't want to over fill it with sauces so you can taste the good meat! The fries are nice and thick and you wont feel that you are eating salt. We upgraded to Poutine and the lady did say that the Poutine is vegetarian friendly, the poutine was quite good.. 

Now for my Muslim Brother and Sisters - The meat here is halal, they have been advertising it but I also saw a certificate near the fountain drink machine.

kapish! till next time."}
{"text":"The burgers here are DELICIOUS!! Love all the options and how good the patties are."}
{"text":"The burgers here were very filling and appetizing.  I had the blue cheese cheese burger which I was unsure about, but the employee let me sample the cheese before I finalized my order which I appreciated. It's definitely an acquired taste and I wouldn't recommend it for your first blue cheese experience. My bf got a burger that had an egg, I forget the name but he liked it. We also split a mushroom poutine, it was a bit salty but they were generous with their serving. Overall the employees were very nice, the place was clean, the food was done promptly. Only thing i would mention is the pricing. It's a little on the higher end for fast food, but its the same for all the other franchises so what can they do. Your meal will be around the same price for a burger at Jack Astors or something like that. But overall, I would come again, I really enjoyed my meal there."}
{"text":"Hero veggie burger is one of my favorite fast food meals but my experience at this specific location was very disappointing. The whole point of Hero burger is to customize the burger with a variety of toppings and sauces. As you can see in my picture, instead of a complex burger I ended up with a bun, lettuce and cheese on a burger. 6 out of 8 toppings were missing! Same deal on the second burger I ordered. As usual I thought the low Yelp rating was maybe not accurate but I should know better than to doubt Yelp scoring! Avoid this location...."}
{"text":"The owner is rude with zero customer service skills. Doesn't know the menu and she is here all day. One of the employees had the nerve to walk upto me while i was eating my food and ask me to pay 99 cents because she forgot to charge me for cheese. I told her I dont mind paying but she has  to wait until im done my food, she refused to leave me alone until I pay. Asked to speak yo manager who called a day later. I wont be returning, I dont recommend this location."}
{"text":"Ridiculously priced and not fast enough for a \"fast food\" joint. Came here with my parents and spent well over $50. I couldn't justify spending $1 for a topping so we stuck with the basic cheese and hero sauce which did not help with how dry the patties tasted. The fries were thick and soggy. Now I love soggy fries, but If Im going to waste calories on fries, you best make sure you've loaded it with sodium. I'll take the bloat for good tasting fries anyday. Not a happy camper, can't say ill return."}
{"text":"Hero burger is one of my favorite burger places but this location (owner) is cheap and it shows. 

I overheard how he trained his staff, teaching her how to save money on here and there. 

I ordered the Turkey burger and it was tough and dry. It was really not delicious. It tasted like it was reheated.

Then on the Coke machine, there's a hand written note taped to it saying Refills are not for combos. Again being cheap.  I wonder if that's official Hero burger policy.  I doubt it, since it's hand written. 

One previous time I came, I showed my email coupon for free fries , the cashier girl was about to punch in the code, then the India guy (I assume owner) grabbed my phone and studied the email for like a minute.  Then said \"okay\".  Ya buddy, I'm here to cheat you out of fries. Don't you know the weekly email specials?  I get them from hero burger every week. 

Anyways, it sad the owner of this place is treating it like he's working at Tim Hortons.  This is Hero burger , a higher class burger joint like Burger Legend, etc"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place to have burgers with friends and family. Also, there are some very nice window view seats. The owner and staffs are super friendly and have nice smile. They offer to bring over our combos instead of calling us over."}
{"text":"I haven't been to hero in months as generally I don't think their burgers are good at all compared to what you can get at other burger shops.

So we tried the chicken burger combo and two solo dogs with an extra fry - $27

Kinda pricey considering that the chicken was about as thin as a fried egg. very bad product offering.  Taste is ok but I'd rather spend $12 on a proper chicken sandwich at another place."}
{"text":"Straight to the point. Our burgers where dry and tough, which is disappointing due to the cost. 

All of the tables where dirty. Quite sticky and crumbs. The place was dead so there shouldn't be an excuse for the mess. I wiped my own table. 

Other hero burgers are clean and good. This location is disappointing."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews is so weird because I would rate this place completely different! 

Service 4/5:
FRIENDLY STAFF, the man at the register cracking jokes, helpful with the menu, etc. It was like 3pm and my aunt and I were the only ones in, so I don't know if that's a factor but it was enjoyable. I'm ONLY docking points because the ONE thing I did w my burger was say no onions or tomatoes, get home and lo and behold...onions and tomatoes. 

Food 5/5: 
Despite there being my arch enemies, raw onions and tomatoes in the food, it was very good! The onion and tomato weren't even a chore to eat so I left a little bit in there due to laziness. Reading the reviews were weird because my burger was notttt dry in any sense! Soft and juicy and tasted delicious! No tendons or anything! One of things I struggle with when eating beef especially! Appreciating that it's halal! 

Ambiance 5/5:
Very clean, fun interior, love that little Nutella inflatable give it to me on my next visit please, thanks lol!

5/5 because not gonna dock it a point over that onion tomato thing lol"}
{"text":"No refills?? 
You cannot get toppings of your choice only the one in pic of the coupon i had .
Lousy service by lady named Samy"}
