{"text":"A group of 20 of us had an excellent Sunday Buffet Breakfast this morning.  Began with an Omelette station. The Chef was Rock N Rolling using 3 omelette pans at a time. The omelette was fluffy and delicious.  Also, choice of bacon, sausage, hash browns, biscuits & gravy. Chicken Fajitas, assorted pastries, fresh fruit salad, and deserts. Service was very good.
I believe price was $9.99.
We will definitely be back..
Job well done!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the memo's on meeker Blvd . We had salads and I will say worst salads we ever had brown lettuce and turkey was not good. We mentioned it to the waitress and she said I will let them know. We did not eat it and we were still charged for it. Lousy customer service and worse salad. It was the Cobb salad and taco salad."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning.  Ordered 2 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns & bacon.  The bacon was not eatable.  I tried 1 piece but couldn't stand the taste. 2 eggs was more like 1.  Sourdough toast was good.   Staff was friendly and attentive even though they were very busy.  There were at least 2 tables of 15+ each."}
{"text":"I just had a breakfast with a group of 18 guys. The service was great, and the food was fresh, hot and delicious. You sure do get a lot for your money. If you go home hungry it is your problem not theirs. I am pretty sure she is the only one working in the morning and I can't believe how well she handled all of us. When she served the food she knew actually who had what. I will be going back to this place for breakfast. It was very relaxing and just a nice place for breakfast."}
{"text":"We found the perfect place for Friday fish fry at Memo's Bistro. The fish was delicious with an awesome batter. The potatoes and coleslaw were exactly how we like them. Our server Kaitlyn kept our plates and beverages full. Price was very fair. We'll be back each Friday. Sincerely, Karen &  Art (Karts) Huseonica, Sun City"}
{"text":"We recently purchased a condo in Sun City, Arizona, as a home base for my husband to obtain medical treatment via the Mayo Clinic and Banner Boswell Hospital's Rehabilitation program, so we have slowly began exploring the various recreation centers available to us.  During one of visits to the Bell Recreation Center, we discovered Memo's Bistro, and are we ever pleased.  

Memo's Bistro is located inside the building that houses the bowling, billards, and indoor shuffle-board courts.  Easy access to the restaurant is located at the back side of the buildings, where there is also free covered parking beneath the newly installed solar system panels.  

It was afternoon when we arrived at the restaurant, but the friendly waitress assured us we could order breakfast anytime, so I ordered the \"sweet potato pancakes.\"  You see I've never encountered sweet potato pancakes in a restaurant, or any place else, in my entire life and my parents were raised in the South where sweet potatoes are a staple.  

To my great surprise, the pancakes were a culinary thrill.  Light, and ever so tasty.  Not sure I'll ever want a regular pancake again.  

Our entire dining experience was excellent, from the good tasting food, to excellent/friendly service, to the clean and welcoming interior.  All menu items were reasonably priced and check-out was easy.  

We will return to Memo's Bistro in the future, as I can't wait to order the sweet potato pancakes again.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Memo's took over the former La Petite Caf√© in the Bell Rec Center building.  We have eaten there several times, and the food has always been good, though the menu is fairly limited.  The owner/manager (Christie) has always been very friendly and talkative and greets each customer individually.  She runs a tight ship as to service.  Our only poor experience was one Friday when she was not there and the two girls running the place took forever to serve the customers .  We waited 25 minutes for a simple dinner order and another 20-25 to get a takehome box and the bill.  Other than that one instance, whenever Christie is there, things are run well and the dining experience is excellent.
The restaurant is quite small (only seats about 40-50 people, and is located by the bowling alleys in the rec center, so it can get crowded at times, but we have always been able to get in.
We live quite close so we eat there often."}
{"text":"Very difficult to locate since it sits in back of several buildings in the SCW pavilion area. Recently a sign has been posted on Meeker Rd."}
{"text":"Alll food is fresh and delicious. We will come back many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I had rosemary, garlic chicken and my husband had the shrimp dinner. Both dinners excellent. Price very reasonable. Service outstanding."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and solid BLT with an egg on it... We didn't bowl this time but I can't wait to come back for a few strikes. Very friendly staff/waitress! Thanks for a wonderful breakfast memos!"}
{"text":"You are eating at a diner connected to a bowling alley. As long as you keep your expectations in check, you'll be happy. All of their food is \"good\". The burgers are above average, so check those out for sure. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Very kid friendly. 

The wine list is superb..............Oh, come on!  Like I said, you are eating at a diner attached to a bowling alley! There ain't no wine list!  No alcohol either, although there is a bar in the bowling alley."}
