{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the pulled pork sandwich with Mac n Cheese. Food was excellent, portions were large and I would highly recommend if you are looking for a good bbq joint!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bbq I've had in Pittsburgh. The brisket sandwich was perfect. Not too much rub, just the right amount of smoke, and the meat was tender AF. Not dry at all. Their sauce is good... Carolina style I think.   Can't wait to go back and try their pulled pork with the mustard based sauce."}
{"text":"I never got to try Area 51 BBQ but I was glad to see it's replacement was another BBQ place. Apparently Spilly's made updates to the space and it is a lot nicer now.   My husband and I ordered takeout from here on a Friday evening and it didn't seem too busy. We ordered ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. We were quite impressed with the meats and the cornbread. FYI, the cornbread had some jalapeño which gave it a nice little kick. The ribs were fall off the bone and they had a really nice char on them. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was their sauce, which seems to be a ketchup base. We got both the regular and the spicy and I couldn't really tell them apart. They tasted mostly of ketchup and vinegar and was rather tangy, which I prefer a sweeter sauce. However, I think the meats were relatively flavorful without the need for sauce.   Great addition to the south hills, as there's always room for bbq!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Pittsburgh. Amazing smell as soon as you walk in the door. Great atmosphere and decor. Even better food. The ribs were fantastic as were the sides (Cole slaw and corn bread). 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my mom and daughter. I was impressed by how clean and perfectly set up this restaurant is. We were also the first ones there but hey I will take it. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It came with cornbread and coleslaw. I also ordered a side of mac n cheese. Everything was really good. The pulled pork comes without bbq sauce and you add it at the table. They have originally, spicy, and carolina to choose from. You really get a large portion for not a lot of money. Who doesn't like that? I would like to come back and try the ribs.  Note- they do have highchairs"}
{"text":"Spilly's BBQ is not the best, but also not the worst BBQ in the area.  Prices are reasonable.  Decor is fresh and clean. GREAT service from the staff."}
{"text":"BBQ Pork was excellent. Enjoyed BBQ brisket also. The cornbread was ok I don't like Jalapeños peppers but my husband liked it a lot. The baked beans were mixture of black beans and regular northern beans. They could have been cooked a little more. They were little hard."}
{"text":"We love it!  We have had take out numerous times.  The Mac and cheese is amazing and have pretty much had all of the meat on the menu.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place cute food is so good a must try if you're craving brisket corn bread smoked ribs"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had take-out for dinner from here on Saturday and was highly impressed. The interior of the restaurant was so nice I do plan to eat-in here very soon. As for the food, the portions were large, the ribs were some of the best he's ever had! The coleslaw was also so so good. Will be dining in together very soon"}
{"text":"Awesome food. I had the combo with the brisket, pork, mac and cheese, and the meaty beans. Everything was perfect! loved it and will be back! meat is on the drier side, but that is how I like my BBQ."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Kentucky and have lived in the Carolinas for over a decade so I take my BBQ seriously. I've only lived here a year, so my husband and I have been slowly eating our way through all the BBQ places in Pittsburgh to find something close to home. We have incredibly high standards so I gave this four stars. But for Pittsburgh though, I'd probably give Spilly's five stars. Most places we've been to fall short. I've only tried the pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. The meat was super tender. The sauces were totally decent. I'm always going to prefer vinegar based, but Spilly's does the trick when I'm craving southern BBQ. I'm also a traditional buttermilk cornbread girl, but the sweet cornbread with what I assume was a little jalapeño was fun. The prices are fair, and the ambiance is nice. I really liked the two vintage pinball machines. Lastly, it's always hard to find decent, non-chain takeout on this side of town when you just don't feel like cooking. I'm glad I can add this place to the short list. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"WOOOOOW!!! I have no words how awesome the food is for a bbq spot! I should have taken pictures!! Will definitely be back for a meal again. The ribs, half chicken, 3 sides is enough for 2-3 people. Meat literally fell off the bone; Mac and cheese, beans, coleslaw were flavorful. Nothing was over salted. I'll be dreaming about this for a while! Great job!! Worth driving out to this part of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue I've had anywhere around Pittsburgh! The brisket, corn bread, beans and coleslaw all were excellent. I will go back any chance I get."}
{"text":"I was sad when Area 51 moved on because I was a big fan, but this place might be even better. Brisket is top-notch. Loved the cornbread. Will need to go back and sample more of the menu, but looks like a winner."}
{"text":"We selected this BBQ place because my nephew suggested it and you can dine inside. I was pleasantly surprised at the decor for a little place. It has a modern vibe. We all ate a different meal. We ended up sharing just to get a taste of the other types of food. The food was priced for the amount that you get. You get a lot of food for your money. The ribs are fantabulous. The pulled pork and BBQ chicken were excellent as well. The meat falls off the bone. There are additional sauces if you choose to add more to your BBQ. It's not necessary, but a must try, as they are all tasty. The Mac n cheese and cornbread have a twist and also were very good. I totally recommend and will go back. They are also on GrubHub and deliver to several areas. I downloaded Yelp just to leave my first review. Try the brisket, brisket chilli, and coleslaw too. Very clean place as well."}
{"text":"OMG: this should be in Lawrenceville, but it's in West Mifflin, finally a hip place in West Mifflin! Decor is urban/industrial/modern..very cool and the food was seriously great! Meat flavorful and tender but also has texture. Sides were great. All traditional bbq, Smokey, not sweet..perfect. they are in process of getting a liquor license too!! Not so much a place for kids..rather cool hangout 20's and up......one tip for owner: the signage (big cowboy that says Spillys) does not indicate a hip spot like they are going through, based on that I thought it would be a cheap tacky place..its doing a disservice to the clientele is imagine they are going for.."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Got the meat platter and both the pork and the brisket were fantastic. Very juicy and savory. Corn bread was very good and meat beans were excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The chicken and beef brisket were amazing. It has the southern seal of approval. They were also very large portions. The cornbread also tasted good but seemed over cooked as it was a bit crumbly. My only complaint was the coleslaw had no taste and was dry. Wasn't a big deal because I just made some extra dressing for it when I got home."}
{"text":"Arrived at Allegheny County Airport for the day and found Spilly's on Yelp. Both of us ordered brisket with mac n' cheese, but I added the \"special\" brisket chili. Coworker wasn't sure that was brisket, maybe actually a roast, but I liked it just fine. The mac 'n cheese was quite good and I liked the sauces. I would suggest a better offering of drinks, but that is a minor issue. Madison was friendly and provided good service with a smile. We don't come to Pittsburgh too often, but will probably return to Spilly's in the future."}
{"text":"Decided to give Spilly's a try. I had the Big Meat platter which consisted of brisket, pork, mac &cheese and coleslaw. Both meats were really good but the pork stood out.  I used the spicy bbq sauce and it was really good. The sides were average in my opinion. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with smoked beaked beans and she said it was \"the bomb\". I tasted the beans and they were very good. If you want some really good bbq, give Spilly's a try."}
{"text":"This used to be Area 51 BBQ. It didn't just change names, it changed everything. The decor is very rustic chic. There are more tables to sit at and they have set hours.  We ordered The Big Meat and the Chicken & Rib Duo for three of us to share. For sides we had Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans. The close slaw is creamy but not sweet. It has a good crunch to it which stands up nicely to the meltiness (I just made that word up) of the meats. A lot of people are serving Mac n cheese but most of it lacks flavor. Theirs has a bit of crunchy topping and is flavorful. It's a great pick for a side. My favorite side, however, is the baked beans. They are smoked. I don't know if many places that have smoky baked beans. They compliment the BBQ meats.  The chicken literally fell off the bone. I picked up a chicken leg and I pulled the skin off to try it. BOOM! The meat fell off. The ribs had a great bark on them. The bones slid right out. The Brisket was some of the most tender brisket I've had. It was cut into cubes. It was easier to eat it that way. The pork was shredded and very moist. They were running Brisket Chili for $5. The gentleman working gave us three samples. It was meaty with a touch of spice. We bought a bowl to take Home for dinner. It will be perfect with our left over BBQ. We couldn't finish it. If you are a BBQ connoisseur you need to get here."}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up take out on Sunday afternoon.  We had the brisket and pulled pork with slaw.  I don't normally like a creamy slaw, but I enjoyed this one.  I usually think of bbq as an indulgence, which is the only reason I don't eat it all the time!  The Carolina mustard sauce and the the spicy sauce were both excellent, and I'm definitely a sauce snob.  Just the right amount of tang, heat and a dab of sweetness.  The brisket was flavorful and tender, and the pork wasn't gummy or dry, which a lot of places can't do pork well.  I'd definitely try some sides next time and hope the brisket chili makes a reappearance on the menu, soon.  Hope the word gets out and this place can stick around for the long haul!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and ate with my husband and 2 children.  Food was great and the staff was super friendly!  The ribs and chicken fall right off the bone and the mac n cheese was cheesy deliciousness.  The cornbread was amazing!"}
{"text":"That barbecue from spilly Xe is fire is real good man is one of the better ones in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This was our first time at spilly's and it will definitely not be our last. My husband and I absolutely loved it! And the staff was great too. I got the ribs and my husband got the pulled pork, both were awesome! There's this delicious crusty outside to the ribs and the inside is still nice and juicy. And the pulled pork was moist and flavorful. And their sauce... I could have eaten the whole bottle, we only had the original, but they have a spicy and some kinda mustard one too. We got the Mac n cheese, baked beans, and corn bread as sides, all phenomenal. Everything's made by them and you can tell, everything flavorful and unique and I can't say enough good things. It is byob so if you want a beer make sure to bring it with you otherwise they have a nice selection of pop."}
