{"text":"Not your average Cafe. A great place to stop by for breakfast and lunch.  Food is always great and they're always offering new dishes daily. Prices are very reasonable as well and you get your money's worth. $5-10 for a huge plate of food and the quality of the food is excellent. Staff are super friendly. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!

to be honest you can't expect anything crazy at a cafe/diner type of spot in this area.  i actually enjoyed the Thursday lunch special of Roast Beef, Corn, Mashed Potatoes, and Garlic Bread for $5.95.  You really can't beat that price in the area unless you to to Metro Food Court.  The quality of the food was at par.  I would recommend this place if you are in the area because you get a lot of food for the price and quality is good.  i would go back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband had the Homemade Shepard's Pie and it was the best.  I also had the beef and barley soup and it was so good and better than homemade.  Their prices are very cheap and their portions are big.  We have been to many cafes and restaurant and this is very good for the price and quality and I would go back there again."}
