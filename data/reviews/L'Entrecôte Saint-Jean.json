{"text":"Here, the only choices you make are your wine and how well you want your steak done. This place reminds me of many establishments in Japan where the restaurant specializes in only one item. The result is simplicity and perfection! 5 stars for the food and 5 stars for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Ok so it's not exactly like the ones in Paris, however I am grateful for having this Montreal location . The fries are so tasty, the steak pretty good and that sauce.... to die for. Always warmly greeted by the waitstaff. A must visit for anyone. Parking can be a challenge.."}
{"text":"The only food on menu is steak and yes they are really good at it."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place for lunch. Pre fix was a salad and steak frites in a delicious mustard sauce. Very good food and our waitress was very nice to our 3 yr old daughter and brought her a free dessert. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I had the striploin steak with fries and salad.  The dinner baguette was soft and delicious but the butter and bread could have been warmed to be perfection.  The salad was butter cabbage with walnuts. Would have been much better with some dried cranberries.  The tried were pretty mediocre, but the steak was tender enough. I asked for medium rare but it came quite medium.   The real winner for me was the atmosphere and the staff. So friendly and the atmosphere is so nice. Ask for the table by the window. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am often craving a steak a la \"entrecôte St Jean\"!  Simple and delicious with a fantastic signature sauce (I actually came very close to replicating it at home...).  As it has been said in other reviews, this is the only menu item.  The choice is salad and steak or la table d'hôte, which come with soup and desert (yummy protiféroles).  The tender steak is, of course, cooked perfectly to your liking (it should as this is the only dish they make).  They have wine but I can't comment because I always go for work lunches..."}
{"text":"Superb!  It's an old-fashioned steakhouse with a limited but excellent menu.  I try to go whenever I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"We have been to Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote in Europe multiple times and were curious how this place would compare.  To begin with, it has more space and we did not need to get in the queue.  We were seated immediately.  We chose the table d'hôte prix fixe option that included:  soup, salad, steak, fries and profiteroles.  The soup that night was cream of leek and it was delicious!  The salad was very nice and tasted less like walnut oil than the European restaurants.  The steak was a nice quality with a tasty \"mustard\" sauce (as our server told us).  The sauce was good, especially with the fries, but it was not the same \"secret herb\" green sauce of Paris and London.  Surprisingly, we thought that the fries were even better here than Europe.  Our serving was North American style, it's what you get on your plate, no second servings.  The profiteroles were delicious even though they seemed colder than we are accustomed.  It was my husband's birthday, so our dear server brought his profiterole with sparkler candles.  It was a fun and delicious surprise.  To sum up in comparison to Le Relais de Venise...:  Soup not served in Europe Salad - slight edge to Saint-Jean, Montreal Steak - Europe Sauce - Europe Fries - Montreal Profiteroles - it's a tie!"}
{"text":"This place is just perfect .... I really crave their steak and fries from time to time .. This place has only one item in the menu ... It is a meal that starts with a nice soup then a really weird salad that I eat every time and promise myself to skip it the next time ... Then comes the great steak and fries that is to die for. You will end the meal with a nice piece dessert. The ambiance and the staff reminds me of the beautiful 80's . It is a place that you must visit if you are coming to Montreal ."}
{"text":"Based on a dinner experience.  Decor, it is nicely decorated and has a lot of seats inside.  If it is cold out, do try to sit further inside if you can because the door can get a bit drafty if it is windy outside although the curtains do help.  Food, I ordered the full course menu and if you check their website, you will find out that they only have one menu and a small menu which is just a subset of the full menu.  I got the cream of leek soup which I thought was good, the walnut salad was nice, the steak was done just right and the sauce is very good along with the fries included and to finish, the dessert was great.  Price, the full menu was $30 which consists of soup, salad, steak and frites and dessert.  I thought it was good value for the price.  Service, the waitress that we had was good and attentive to what we needed and even split the bill for a 7 person table and the tip wasn't included for such a large group either.  I'd have no problems recommending the place to anyone who would like steak."}
{"text":"I must say, this is an interesting concept in a restaurant. The menu is exceedingly simple: Soup of the day, salad with nuts, loin steak + frites, desert. I will hand it to the owner as coming up with a wining formula to make money in a restaurant.   The soup was a tomato-vegetable soup which was thin and did not have any real body. I would expect a more rich soup. Salad was simple lettuce with walnuts and an oil dressing. The salad was too oily and the dressing was lacking flavor. The main course was, again, solid food - but did not impress me with the bistro flavor I was expecting. The loin steak is not the most flavorful cut. The frites were average tasting and would have been better if they were fresher. Dessert was two bollocks on a plate (ice cream balls covered with pastry and covered with chocolate). The pastry was stale, so I just fished out the ice cream.   Overall a decent concept, but with essentially one soup, one salad, one main and one desert on the menu I would expect them all to be excellent and flavorful. This did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I read the earlier review about how terrible the food is, and I have to say they got it right. If they do only one thing, you think they could get it right. The fries were from the freezer and the steak smothered in sauce. The salad was miserable and the profiteroles were with ice cream, not whipped cream, which I think is miserable. There is good food to be had in Montreal, but not here."}
{"text":"The best steak grites this side of Paris. Hands down no discussion. The profiteroles are good, wine is simple but very good. Nothing fancy but a little slice of Paris in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's a very traditional dish and I've had similar experience in Paris before and they taste pretty similar.  Personally I've had way better steak with better cut or preparation but I think that's not so much the point with this restaurant. It satisfies a basic need for steak I guess.  Nothing bad but if you want really good steak I'm pretty sure you can find better."}
{"text":"Please read this before you go. This might save you from a bad experience.  We read the reviews on yelp and came here. We were surprised to see the limited items on the menu. And we thought that with only a steak to make, it must be masterfully done.  Four of us entered and were greeted by the only lady who wasn't in uniform. The place had a nice vintage, faded glory vibe. We sat down at a table in front of the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before we got our water. The lady who served us, in fact everyone in the resto, looked like they were working in the army: no smile, angry-looking, albeit self-efficient and prompt. We were intimidated to even ask for anything and felt like eating in training camp. It was very awkward and uncomfortable.  The steak was disappointing (and that's the only thing they make too). We ordered the steak medium rare and medium, but all the meat was tough even to the knife. We doubted the quality of the meat was acceptable. The carrot soup was nice and refreshing, however. Fries were crispy and the bread was fluffy. The dessert tasted like something you'd find at a college dining hall.  It was a scar to our trip to Montreal. We trusted yelp and went but the service was horrible, and the only table d'hôte offered was subpar, even for the price. We argued that we could have gotten nicer steaks at Chili's in the United States for the same price."}
{"text":"Simple menu for Steak Frites. Fairly old school in terms of decor, service and selection - but that's good in my book. Steak was tasty with their signature sauce. Frites leant towards the standard North American style. Soup was welcome, and the dessert of profiteroles were ice-cream, instead of cream based - still very tasty. A straight-forward no nonsense restaurant which has been obviously doing things well for a very long time. In summary, great value for money and you will walk away with a full stomach and a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"No jacket required. At least during the summer months. Found many people in shorts and t-shirts. I guess they relaxed the attire code. Good food and service."}
{"text":"We returned from a day out sight seeing and I decided to look for some inexpensive ($$ or $$$) french food.  I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice.   As others have stated, there is only one entree.  Your only choice is whether  you want soup or not and we ordered it.  We also ordered some house wine and were served bread and butter with it.  The bread was good and so was the wine - what I'd expect for the price.   The carrot soup was ok.  It was a bit bland but not bad;  That was the highlight of the meal!  The 'salad' was iceberg lettuce, walnuts (right out of the bag) and a bland vinaigrette dressing that was very acidic.  They could have at least toasted the walnuts if not glaze them and it wouldn't take much effort to improve the looks and flavor of the salad by adding a bit of arugula or other mix.    The main course, was of coarse, the steak and fries.  The steak was very low grade, tough and not a lot of flavor.  The sauce helped a bit.  The fries were fine for what they were.  The price is $26.95 per plate which is way too much for the quality of the food served.  Service was ok, not bad but nothing special either.  When we go out to eat, the biggest factor about whether we like it or not is the food.  The food here is way below average and the price is way too much for what it is."}
{"text":"There is only one thing on the menu: Steak & Frite! Really good and one of he best desserts ever!"}
{"text":"??3???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This my favorite restaurant in the world. I love other places for different cuisines, but the formula that Entrecôte Saint-Jean uses in every aspect of dining is world class. Whenever my girlfriend and I travel to Montreal, we drop out bags and head here. We even book a room at the Marriott across the street so we are close!  The steak is always perfectly cooked and the sauce is delectable. We always lick the plate on each course but ALWAYS have a bit of room for the fantastic profiteroles."}
{"text":"The menu is pure simplicity. The tables are set exactly as you would expect for Steak Frites. This isn't the place for you if you are looking for an American over-the-top steak house that is going to feed till you burst. This is real French Steak Frites done well. The soup was more parmentier than leek, but let's be realistic, it's just soup. The bread was crusty. The salad was plain Boston lettuce with a vinaigrette and some walnuts, but dressed correctly and dry before the vinaigrette was added, so it isn't watery. The steak was done as per order, the fries were well cooked, the sauce flavoured with mustard was excellent and made you want to dredge your fries in them. The profiteroles only came in chocolate, but were filled with ice cream, tasty, but a non-chocolate option should be offered. The service was classic and well done. What's not to like about a restaurant showing that simplicity is sometimes exactly what you need.   Dating someone who takes forever to decide what to have for dinner? This is your place! There are two choices... steak frites with or without the table d'hote. That's it. Done!"}
{"text":"I visited the Quebec City outpost of this restaurant (not sure if they are affiliated?) and was very happy there, so I was excited to see how they do steak frites in Montreal. Location cannot be beat, it's right beside Peel metro station, and there is a summertime terrase with a view of Mont Royal up the street. We sat inside and enjoyed the ambient French background music. Menu is very small here, you really only have the choice of the larger steak combo with salad and soup, or the smaller one with only one of the above. Unfortunately no appetizers like the location in Quebec City - I was sad because I do enjoy the chicken liver mousse up there. Salad: We all got the full-leaf salad with dressing and walnuts, and this was the same excellent quality as up in QC.  Steak: I love the sirloin cut here, it's very thin with a soft inside, and the outside is not charred. Very delicate texture. Same quality as QC, however the mustard sauce here is better than in QC in my opinion! Rather than distracting you from the flavor of steak, it actually enhances the light delicate flavor and provides you with a mouthful of juice in each bite. Fries: Matchstick as per their tradition, very delicately fried and not dripping with grease or salt. These are some of the lightest tasting fries I've ever had and I loved them. Service: Our waitress was not very conversational and very to-the-point, which is where this location seems to fall short of the QC outpost. Loved the French maid outfit though. Overall I'm quite impressed with this place, having visited it along with the QC location! I'd happily recommend both, and give higher points to the MTL location for the flavor of the steak sauce. Bon appetit, friends."}
{"text":"Our 2nd dinner in this well known place. Above average piece of meat, without being at the top level. At least, you can get it blue, not that easy in North America. Being with good friends helped us waiting forever to get served. 2 hours for a dinner, sounds unusual here. The Brouilly was of great value."}
{"text":"There is only a steak with or without soup and dessert The steak best served medium or rare The price reasonable but a mandatory service (tip) might be annoying Noisy but warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"the first reviewer has summed it up. perhaps best steak frites in Montreal."}
{"text":"L'Entrecôte Saint-Jean is a great little bistro with the simplest possible concept: steak frites. There's only one cut, entrecote (strip loin), and practically no menu. Either you have the table d'hôte (soup, walknut salad, steak frites and profiteroles) for about $25. or the same without starters and desserts for about $20. They pride themselves on doing one thing and doing it perfectly, and in my experience that's exactly what they achieve! It has a lovely ambience: white tablecloths and nice lighting without being snooty or intimidating. It's friendly enough for a nice group dinner, but classy enough for a charming night out with your partner. It's only been around since 1991 but it feels so classic that you imagine it might have been sitting on Peel forever."}
{"text":"Much loved bistro that serves a steak frites with a yummy mustard sauce. It's a nice restaurant to take someone special to because it has a level of class and sophistication without being snobbish and overly expensive. Great spot for an extended lunch. Not recommended for vegans."}
{"text":"I rarely add my own reviews on Yelp, but this place is beyond praise. The steak frites are out of this world (let alone the steak sauce) and the service extraordinarily good for Montreal standards. This place alone is reason to visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! Undecided after work, we decided to head over to this gem. It screams Paris and the fact the menu is so limited you know it works. The steak was delicious as was the sauce. You could put it on anything. Wonderful salad, steak frites and profiteroles that were wonderful.   I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable French meal. It's delicious and well worth it and centrally located to downtown. Sometimes the classics are timeless and this is definitely In that category."}
{"text":"Simple concept, soup of the day, nice salad and the restaurant special - Entrecote - WOW !!  I am total fan of this place, in fact, every time I am in Montreal I make it a point to visit because it is that good !!!  The only problem has been that I cannot find any other place in the world where their entrecote steak is good as this one. Usually this cut of beef is very sinewy - not here ! clean, cooked to order simple and of course with the mandatory serving of fries.  In Montreal ? definitely try this place ! You will like it !"}
{"text":"Very good steak frittes. The sauce is very original, like the one served in Paris although the steak was small it was still very good.   The cream of tomato soup was also very good and the service was great. When in Montreal don't miss out going there."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little gem in the neighborhood. If you are looking for a traditional steak house, this is not for you. It resembles a French bistro with two options for a meal. Having said that, food was exquisite. The steak was done just right and the sauce on top was just the right touch, without overwhelming the meat.  The soup of the day was carrot soup, which was very good. Staff is friendly, especially given we had our toddler with us.   I can see why some reviewers may have been disappointed if they were looking for a typical high-end steak house. I have been to numerous steak houses all over the world and this one is definitely a must-visit on my list. Don't expect a pretentious, cigar bar type of establishment. I would compared it to a \"great baguette\". Clean, simple, and just-done-right kind of a place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Although restaurant inside is great my husband and I chose to eat outdoors to see the pedestrians and traffic. Ultimately, this was entertaining to us. We both ordered the Special entrecôte - one with soup and one with the walnut salad. Both were amazing! The soup was refreshing with hints of onion or leeks and the salad had a light and tangy dressing with the best walnuts. I asked for medium rare steak but more rare and it came out perfect. The sauce over the steak is s butter Dijon but more butter than Dijon and I'm in love with this sauce! I would highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"L'Entrecote Saint-Jean was a very nice establishment to dine in at.  Clean, fancy, elegant with friendly service and an excellent wine selection.  I like the fact that they kept the menu simple when I went with some friends for dinner with three full course selections to choose from.  I ordered the salad with walnuts, steak and fries with a bottle of red house wine and the steak was fantastic.  Next time I come here I will try the soup and if I have room in my stomach get some dessert as well."}
{"text":"I thought it was very boring considering the price. They have 1 dish and it's a basic salad and steak and fries. The steak I had coated $20 and was thin and tough.  The fries are pretty lame too. I don't understand the great reviews."}
{"text":"The menu was simple and straight forward. 3 steak options and 1 vegan option.   I got the star which was a 12 oz sirloin steak smothered in their special sauce pairs with steak fries and a choice of soup or salad to start.   For dessert we got the house special profiteroles au chocolait which looked like an eclair ball with vanilla ice cream inside surrounded by a pool of belgian chocolate.   It's a good place for dinner. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is great for a date. Simplicity is the key and this place has mastered it.  This place cooks the steaks perfectly. Medium rare people!!! Their take of steak Diane is beautiful. When going there for the first  time I had no idea about the sauce.  It just makes my mouth water thinking about it. I clean the plate dunking the fries, the bread, anything I can find in it.  Everything that's served with the meal is good as well. The profiteroles are a delight. You gotta give it a try!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here the other night. We had read about this place before coming to Montreal and were excited to go. The service and food did not disappoint. The space is fantastic. Everything from the high mirrored walls to the tiled floor to the vintage French posters gave this restaurant an incredible feel.  The staff was welcoming and very professional. They made sure we were well taken care of at every point during the meal. The food was superb. The soup was tasty. The salad came with fresh walnuts and a nice simple vinaigrette.  The beef was cooked perfectly to temperature (medium rare or 'a point' as they say), a little tough to cut in a few places, but very tasty.  The fires were nice crispy shoestrings. The sauce may have been the best part of the meal.  I'm guessing, but mustard and tarragon with butter and perhaps ... I don't know, but it's fantastic. Once you're going, the juice from the beef, the sauce and the fat from the fries come together to make an exceptional gravy on your plate. Douse forkfuls of fries in this and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had the Spécial entrecote which is the striploin with frites and the salad with walnuts. Salad was fresh and very tasty, the steak was cooked as odered and a good cut, and the frites were deicious. Wine-by-the-glass was a limited selection but still good value. Service was attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Having lived in France for over a decade, I can affirm that this place is pretty authentic. The soup was a Cream of Carrot that was quite tasty though a little too creamy for my taste. The entrecôtes were perfectly cooked, both the \"à point\" and the \"saignant\", according to the French style. If you're looking for \"medium\" or \"rare\", you might want to ask for a little longer on the grill. The frites were just like in France, the salad was fresh, the dressing was authentic, and the wine list was great. The service was also friendly and attentive. And at that price, what more can one hope for? I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great place for dinner after work. The atmosphere was very pleasant. The servers were quite attentive and knowledgeable about the wine. For a group of six, the meal was enjoyed by everyone.  The Dijon steak sauce for first timers was best on the side, but for the regulars they couldn't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Vous êtes prévenu en entrant!  Ils ne servent que des entrecôtes et deux choix (selon mes souvenirs) vous sont proposés. À Québec d'où est a l'origine le restaurant, ils ont la chance d'en proposer 3. Bref pas très variés, beaucoup trop bruyant, beaucoup trop serré (vive la promiscuité!)... Pour le folklore : ok ... Pour la qualité de la soirée: allez ailleurs!"}
{"text":"L'Entrecote Saint-Jean has an old school charming Brassiere vibe with friendly staff that make the dining experience certainly enhanced. Perfect for dinner with family. That being said, its all about steak here and it's decent but not outstanding. Price wise it's certainly reasonable and all in all we had a good time dining."}
{"text":"Very cool concept for a restaurant! Simple and traditional, which is an experience in of itself. A pre-set meal, it was nice not having to choose! Good value with soup, salad, steak and profiteroles for a reasonable price. Everything was very good. Nothing blow me away good.   Steak was cooked well with a honey mustard-ish sauce on top. Took a second to get used to it but it was very good. Ambience made us feel we were in an authentic Parisian place in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the classic special striploin Entrecote with walnut salad and French fries. I thought the sauce was delicious and the meal as a whole was great. The restaurant is very classy with good service my only remark is it is a bit pricy for lunch for what it is maybe they should have a lunch menu."}
{"text":"I came here as a teen with my family. There was much amusement at the fact that the menu was so limited to steak frites. Perhaps it's nostalgia, but I still love this place. The meat was definitely overlooked (we asked for Medium and it was Well Done), but the fries and salad were pitch-perfect."}
{"text":"Go here if you feel indecisive about what to eat. There is only one thing to choose from. The steak n frites is solid."}
{"text":"How could a menu so simple be so divine. A flavourful tomato soup on a chilly day to start, followed by a perfectly grilled steak and Dijon sauce with Frites. And completed with a smooth and not too sweet creme caramel."}
{"text":"It's a simple, straight forward menu and everything is done to perfection. The salad is minimalistic but the dressing is unique and flavourful. The steak is full of flavour and cooked exactly to your liking. Ambiance brings you to feeling like your in Paris. Love it every time."}
{"text":"I was warned.  One of the more regretful meals I have had in Montreal.  Strange because a few years ago I recall a review that sang the praises of \"L'entrecote.  I do not understand why.  Previous reviewer said that soup was hot and lightly seasoned.  Confirmed - soup is, well, just soup and scaldingly hot.  Previous reviewer said that salad was bizarre.  Confirmed - Boston lettuce with nondescript dressing and fresh walnuts on top.  At least they weren't rancid which is commonly the case.  Previous reviewer commented that steak was badly cooked.  Actually steak was cooked to my specifications but the frites and the 'special' sauce on the meat were unremarkable.  Previous reviewer talked about how dessert was good at very least.  Disagree.  Dessert too was bland and unremarkable.  Servers seemed a little depressed overall.  Not a good vibe here.  would not choose to return."}
{"text":"Le sigh... this brought me right back to one of my favorite things in Paris. While nothing can compare to Le Relais de l'Entrecote, this place came pretty darn close! First, the service, it was perfect to me. Our waitress was polite, sweet, and let us enjoy our dinner and conversation, but checked in on us just enough to make sure we were taken care of. If you know the restaurant in Paris I refer to, you know the menu is simple, and it was very similar here. The salad was simple and fresh. The meat was cooked just how I asked and the fries were hot and crispy.  The sauce wasn't quite the same but still delicious nonetheless.  You don't get the double serve on the steak and fries, but it's still a good amount of food.  This will be a must if and when I ever visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal w a great server. She was a doll!  And we appreciated her attention to details & catering to all our diff preferences for our steaks.   They do this 1 item very well so come & enjoy the fruits of their hard work.   Folks here r great w service & r an example for other restaurants to follow!!!"}
{"text":"The food was actually great, but one star for the horrendous service. I can't speak for all of the servers, but don't come here if you're looking for a good dining experience. Our service was awful.  My boyfriend and I ordered the sirloin with the soup, salad, and dessert ($32 combo). The server never introduced herself, never tried to have a conversation with us, never explained anything on the menu nor the concept, nor once tried to treat us like we were anything other than just another check.  When we ordered, we made one single substitution to the combo: we swapped out the profiteroles for creme caramel (a $0.50 difference). That fifty cent substitution came back as a fifteen dollar increase on our bill. The waitress then decided that was the appropriate time to explain they have a no substitution policy, so she \"had to\" ring up each item in the combo individually. Midway through the conversation with my boyfriend, she tossed the receipt at him, walked 10 feet away, and turned her back to us until we paid. Unbelievable. Once we paid the ridiculously inflated bill and tipped, she proceeded to start an unsolicited argument with us about how the charges were justified.  Anyway, they have one single item on the menu: the steak. It's excellent."}
{"text":"This place only spécialise on one thing: the entrecôte! So don't go there for anything else, there isn't any. This being said, this is one of the best meat I ever had and cooked to your desire. The fries are also perfect, the salad so fresh, the bread crunchy and the desert (profiteroles) not too sweet and full of flavor. I'll return for sure on my next visit :-)"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant so much we started staying in a Hotel closer to it to make it easier to get there when we visit Montreal and it is usually our first meal.  We always get the Table D'Hote, which comes with a Bibb salad with walnuts, and profiteroles for dessert.  Entrecote is Steak in a wonderful sauce and perfectly cooked French Fries and this Restaurant does it perfectly.  I had a glass of the Rose which was lovely  and my Husband had a beer, which was extremely good and not surprising  in Canada.  I am not a particular fan of Steaks, but this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Ambience: 5 stars Service: 5 stars (the founder's grandkid himself helped us) Timing: 5 stars Wine: 5 stars Price: for a pre fixed menu, that was 5 stars Food: 1,000,000 stars! The most delicious thing ever!  Was great."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago it's hard to find good French food. So, might want to take that into consideration. But, wow! To me, this place is amazing! They play old French music, it looks like an old fashion French restaurant and the steak and frites are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I love steak, but I've never actually been to a steakhouse before coming here so I don't have any other experiences to compare it to. So here's a review from a steakhouse newbie.  The menu is so simple it's basically only steak frites, so you just have to decide if you want an appetizer and/or dessert too. I usually get the soup du jour which has always been satisfying and tastes homemade. The steak is prepared well, I wanted it rare and it was cooked properly. The sauce is a creamy mustard type and tastes great with the fries as well. I never have room for dessert so I can't comment on that.   The service is friendly and efficient; it's a busy place so they are very quick. I recommend making a reservation, especially for peak times, as the place does get pretty full. It's possible to make reservations through their website (I hate talking on the phone).   Is it the best steak? I'm sure it's not, but it's tasty and good value. I leave the place feeling full from a good meal so that's great."}
{"text":"From out of town and wanted steak-frites.   Must say it was great.   Excellent cook on the steak and fantastic fries and wonderful sauce.  Spot on.  Very nice staff and prompt service.  The restaurant was elegant but exceptionally  comfortable.   I would go back."}
{"text":"Simple  menu very well prepared. Nice Parisian feel. Don't sit close to the entrance on cold evenings though, the drapes do not keep out the chill no matter what the staff may tell you."}
{"text":"Yelpers, do not be fooled by the reviews. I trusted the reviews and went to this restaurant believing that the steak is \"amazing\" as the yelpers say it is. Unfortunately, the steak was a joke! I never had any steak as horrible as this. The steak is not even a steak, it tasted like some \"leftover\" meat formed into a steak. Oh, if you would like to try something else on the menu...Unfortunately, the \"so-called\" steak is the only option in the menu. Only the soup, and fries were edible but I didn't come.here to snack. I would not recommend anyone to dine here."}
{"text":"Have returned several times since my first visit.  The service is always courteous and professional, the food is always excellent and the room is always clean and well maintained.    Several reviewers commented about the lack of selection - sadly they fail to appreciate the point of this restaurant: which is to do a limited number of things very well at a very good price - at which they are very successful."}
{"text":"Rien de spécial dans ce restaurant. Le potage de carrotte goûte un peu comme celle que j'ai au cafétéria de mon école. La salade est beaucoup trop huileux, comme si c'est trempé par de l'huile. On y trouve pas un goût rafraiche. Quant au plat principal, rien de surprenant. J'avoue que la sauce du buf est spécial, mais ça couvre le goût de la viande. Tant pis, le morceau de buf est trop dur est mince. Mais les frites vont parfaites avec cette sauce, heureusement."}
{"text":"A Upscale Steak & Frites place. Food is good. If you go during the winter season, avoid sitting next to the door, because you will feel the cold air blowing in. Don't let the maitre D intimidate you when he says the \"curtains\" keep the cold hair out... It's a lie!"}
{"text":"It was quite good. We both ordered the simple menu with steak and salad.  The steak was done very well.  Salad's dressing was too acidic.  And the wine I got wasn't very matching to the steak.  Overall, it was a pleasant dinner experience. Service was friendly as well"}
{"text":"Downtown Montreal is full of good restaurants and I am always eager to try different ones. L'Entrecote St-Jean was founded by a French immigrant who opened its first restaurant in the Vieux Quebec in the 80's. Then came down to Montreal to put foot on Peel street in the heart of downtown Montreal. The restaurant has a nice feel to it. You are greeted warmly upon your arrival. It definitely resembles the French bistros in Paris. Their menu is very simple you either choose a striploin or a sirloin with salad or soup. The concept is very singular but I guess it's a Steak Frites and I shouldn't expect more. They have a nice wine list with few reserve privée. I was not wowed by the soup and lacked flavor. The salad was extremely oily and so very vinagery (my own expression ) I chose the striploin which was very chewy with lots of veins. I have to say their secret sauce as they call it was good. I didn't take any desert that evening because of too much  which by the way was fresh and kept coming. The coffee was not the best I have tasted. So, the place looks really nice but the food is disappointing. I am sure with the price they charge they can get better cuts. I am not sure if I would be back."}
{"text":"Was told that this was the best valued steak in Montreal. Although it didn't hurt the wallet too much, for a place with one item on the menu, steak, our expectations were higher for the quality of the meat. The servers were friendly enough and the first courses of tomato soup or salad with walnuts didn't disappoint. The steak sauce was flavorful and made for a nice accompaniment to the fries but we weren't as impressed as we would have hoped to be with the actual quality and flavor of the meat. The strip steak I think is a better value than the sirloin."}
{"text":"When the restaurant only has one menu, it means something. They have expertise in what they cook. The salad was fresh and lettuces were crisp and young. The beef was so tender and juicy. The dessert was the best and reminded me of the best choice cream I have ever had before."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here out of the cold thinking it was a full menu french bistro.  I thought they gave me just the specials menu by mistake.  Wasnt too happy to find the only two options were if you wanted the app & dessert or not.  Was extremely surprised that I loved it especially considering I wasnt in the mood for a steak diane type steak.  Ok, it might not be anything similar to steak diane but it reminded me of it."}
{"text":"There were very limited menu options. I presumed that the place had these as specialties but the food turned out to be terrible. Was not seasoned well and had very small portions. Service was below average and when leaving, the waitress watched as we paid the bill. We tipped very little for the above reasons and as we were leaving, the waitress actually questioned our payment."}
{"text":"If I can give a 0 star to this place I would. I got tricked to go here by the fake four star review on Yelp. It's my second day in this excellent city and I was hungry and wanted find a decent place to eat fast. The menu here is extremely simple and I was hoping for something phenomenal because of the simplicity. The free bread was cold. The soup of the day (tomato soup) was alright. The steak was a shame. It comes with a retarded mustard sauce (I asked it to be on the side). The steak is a really bad cut (called streak loin), tasting tough even being cooked rare (let alone the amazing cow juice I was hoping for). There's no seasoning at all without the sauce n I had to add salt n pepper myself. As a meat lover, I think adding any sauce to a nicely cooked steak is a joke. The presentation of the dish is terrible, served on some cheap diner like plate. The meat itself also tastes kinda funny, with some sort of mild odor I couldn't figure out. The fries coming with the steak look even more diner n I didn't even bother tasting them. Because I was hungry n tired n the food was somewhat edible I didn't send it back to the kitchen (I'm also not a super fussy person), but I genuinely felt it was an insult to my stomach at the end of the meal. I expressed my disappointment to the server before paying n she said I should have sent it back. Whatever. I'm never coming back again and advising my fellow steak lovers not wasting your time, appetite, n $ (it's way over priced for what it is). Also, to the restaurant owner: r u really French??! This place is total disrespect to the so labeled \"French food\"."}
{"text":"En famille conseillé par un ami Suisse, bonne qualité de viande frites et sauce.   Pas beaucoup de choix entrecôte ou contrefilet et frites, avec potage ou salade en entrée. À conseiller pour bien manger du buf."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good steak. American style, Brazilian, Argentinean, you name it. The French are known for their Steak & Frite. I heard of this Entrecote Saint-Jean a few weeks ago and figured I'd give it a shot.   Now. If your menu has only ONE item and your restaurant is jam packed like it was tonight, shouldn't the grub just blow me away? I think so.  While the restaurant is a thing of an age gone by beauty, the food isn't.   It's simple. You get soup, salad, steak & frite and desert... let's go through them, because when I want to crush something I do it step by step.  Leek Soup. Not half bad, piping hot, but severely lacking in the seasoning department.   Salad. The lettuce hadn't gone bad but some leaves were definitely damaged. The dressing was so so and very rare, as in barely a teaspoon of it for the whole salad.  The Steak & Frite. Now this is where I get bitchy. Firstly if you promise me match-stick fries, don't bring me frozen McDonald's like French fries. Secondly the steak... This is a French restaurant. The French who invented everything about cooking worth a damn, should know something simple, some very rudimentary about steak preparation. Once you take it off the heat YOU HAVE TO LET IT REST. It's the only thing on their fucking menu and they fuck it up. My plate was a bloody mess, completely screwing up the sauce. They have ONE thing on the menu and they haven't mastered it. What a shame.  Desert was the saving grace. Profiteroles, delicious and refreshing. But I doubt I'll be going back. When I don't finish a 6 oz steak, there's something wrong with this world.  The service was good, but never were we asked about how are meal was going, if it was any good. All in all it's a very pretty restaurant, with decent service, but really unimpressive food. I can't understand why it's so packed."}
{"text":"Okay, so there are a lot of ways you can look at this place.  One way is - this is a steakhouse and you are going in to enjoy a good piece of steak.  Another way is to look at it as an experience that replicates the kind of dining you might find in  a French restaurant while ordering steak frites along the way.  I decided to take the latter approach because honestly, the steak here isn't something that would blow away what you'd find at Peter Luger in NYC or frankly any other major/famous American steakhouse.  The steak here was fine, but not earth-shattering.  The famous/secret sauce was a nice dijon sauce but again, it isn't going to be some amazing thing that will blow most people's minds.  However, the entire dining experience was nice because it really did remind me of some of the places I ate in when I was in Paris.    This outpost in Montreal (since the original is in Quebec City) serves a very simple menu.  Steak with fries and soup or salad .. with some minor variation of the aforementioned, or a veggie patty substitute for the fries.  The steak itself was fine.  The texture was juicy with some chewiness as well.  I wouldn't say it would replace a killer NY strip steak cut I get in a heavy duty steakhouse, but for a steak frites plate it was fine.  The carrot soup was actually quite delicious and the cabbage/walnut salad was simple and did the job.  The porfiterole dessert was fine as well.  All in all the experience was enjoyable though I wouldn't say this is a \"must-eat\" in Montreal if you have limited time.  I was there for nearly 6 days so I had plenty of dining opportunities and wanted to try this out, but if you're there and have less time to spare, I wouldn't say this is a must-do.    From a price perspective, I feel that the food here is reasonable in that respect."}
{"text":"Bonjour...if you're into steak and frites with the special tangy sauce, this place is for you. And besides the soup and salad, that's all they serve you.  This is typical compared to the other l'entrecote steak joints I've been too before, but the sauce here is different and wasn't wowed as much. And unlike the other l'entrecote steak joints, they only serve you one plate of steak and frites. But they make it up with if you do the combo.  Still a decent meal if you do the combo, where I chose the soup, salad and a dessert at the end for about $35. Not bad for Montreal.  Still has the same Paris style decor with the tight adjacent tables, but I came in for a late lunch so there were no other diners right next to me. Semi-decent views if you get a window table."}
{"text":"The staff were warm and welcoming with a big smile when I entered. I was seated quickly and they were very attentive throughout. I always love a simple menu and this place has that. Delicious fresh salad and bread followed by steak and fries. I couldn't resist the red wine. It would have been wrong, even if it was 2 pm. The fries were perfection and my med rare steak was cooked to perfection. My only complaint was the steak sauce which was a little too heavy in its seasoning. Otherwise this is a quaint classic very nice spot. I'm also a sucker for mosaic tiles."}
{"text":"Best steak frites!  I've been here three times. Am blown away every time. All they have is steak and fries. But the place has been packed for three generations. Whatever is in that gravy they put on everything, I could live on!  It is sooooo delicious!  They recommend the steak medium. It's a thin cut  and man it's tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I had flashbacks of older bistros in less touristy areas of France.  The menu however was a little strange.  The only entree available is a steak with their special sauce, which I think is a variation of Dijon sauce.  The steak was cooked medium rare just right but it's a thinner sirloin cut that tasted a little cheap and overpowered by the sauce.  To be honest, I thought it was kind of appropriate since I have had very similarly bad steaks in Paris. The whole let a thick slab of beef speak for itself thing isn't quite as pervasive in France yet. The steak coming with only French fries though was definitely unusual and decidedly not French. Eight the Dijon sauce, I thought it tasted like deconstructed poutine.  Soup was fine.  Tomato juice tasted like tomato juice.  Salad was just lettuce leaves with pretty typical dressing.  If not for the dessert, I'd have given 2 stars.  The dessert however was excellent.  It was basically an ice cream puff (with croissant pastry I think) covered by chocolate. Very delicious, along the lines of a very good eclair with ice cream fillings and extra chocolate.  I think I'll love this place as a place to chat all night over wine but I will pass on the food next time."}
{"text":"We have tried steak and fries in many places over the years but this place continues to be our favorite place.  They have the best steak and fries anywhere, even better than Paris."}
{"text":"Alwayss perfect. I've been going there with my family every now and then for at least 10 years now. The service is perfect, people are nice, the food is always perfect too. It's a great restaurant to gather with your family"}
{"text":"We were up in Montreal for a few days on vacation.  We randomly walked into this place because my boyfriend wanted a steak.  They have exactly one thing on the menu.  Steak.  It was great.  Simple.  We started with a simple salad with walnuts and then the steak for the main course.  The steak was a thin strip steak covered with a specialty sauce served with french fries.  The steak was tender, the sauce tasty and the fries light and crispy. The meal was delicious and satisfying.  The staff was welcoming and efficient.  We even spoke to the owners grandson who told us the story about how the restaurant started.  The atmosphere was quaint.  This was a definite find for just randomly walking into a restaurant.  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"They have one thing on the menu. Steak & frites (fries), with a wonderful lemon - mustard - butter sauce from what I can gather. You can order that just with a soup or salad or you can order it with both soup and salad plus 2 ice cream filled chocolate profiterole's at the end of your meal.  I love the butter leaf lettuce salad, with the balsamic vinaigrette and walnuts. But the soup is fresh and delicious too. Also the complementary bread here is fantastic, perfect for soup dunking.   I have been coming to this restaurant on and off for the past 20 years. It was special back then when I was a teenager going to McGill University and it is still special today.  The staff is French, professional; the food is consistent and delicious. In the summer you can sit outside, on the street patio, it's beautiful and relaxing.   It's always nice to order a red wine with your steak and the coffee is also delicious. I can't put a finger on why I love this restaurant so much but I think I always will. I just feel that it's special."}
{"text":"Great steak and sauce. 4 course meal with soup, salad, and desert for a fair price. Service was quick with no trouble getting a table on Friday night. I feel pretty confident I picked a good spot for my first steak and frites experience."}
{"text":"Classic, Iconic, steeped in French Bistro tradition L'Entrecôte Saint-Jean was said to be the favorite restaurant of , Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau former Prime Minister of Canada, perhaps for good reason during his day. Traditions have a way of waning and becoming long-in-the-tooth especially when the signature item, the entrecôte does not live up to it's venerable longstanding tradition of praise worthy accolades.  The interior setting of the restaurant is what you would expect in a very good French Bistro, the service excellent; yet, when the most memorable part of the meal is the frites, baguette and butter, then something needs to be rethought at the restaurant.   The simple Bibb lettuce salad with walnuts was under dressed; for that reason lacked flavor, the steak looked marvelous but was tough to cut even with a sturdy steak knife and lacked a robust beef flavor, the Dijon mustard sauce imo needed more Dijon to perk the entire plate up. The frites were perfect, some of the best without question and what can I say about the bread and butter in Quebec, c'est magnifique, once you have tried it you will understand why Americans make such a fuss about Montreal's bread and butter. As with most house wines in Quebec, I don't believe you will ever be disappointed they have always been more than adequate and priced reasonably.   2.5 stars is a more appropriate grade for the the dining experience; that would be due to the feel, charm and the sense of days gone by and the dignitaries who have passed through the doors of this charming French bistrot."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to do - you need to come here and order a glass of the Grenache and enjoy the complimentary crusty baguette. Then you need to order the unbelievable salad which is so simple yet perfect and then of course the steak and frites. Firstly they've gotten the sauce to steak and frites ratio perfect. It's like a science. Eating it did not feel laborious at any stage as eating a steak can sometimes feel. It was like silk. You should come here and finish with another glass of Grenache. My only regret is not getting dessert. Also our waitress  Maria was wonderful. Service was impeccable the minute we walked in. This will be a mandatory visit next time I'm in Montreal"}
{"text":"With only one option being steak and fries this establishment is easy, simply and yet I enjoyed my meal quite thoroughly. If your only going to do one thing right do it well. The soup was delicious, the salad was average the steak was extremely tender and the dessert was rich and topped the meal off perfectly.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"7/26/2015 We came here from a recommendation, and the idea of a Steak and Frites restaurant was too cool not to try it out.  A simple menu and doing that menu right? Usually its a recipe for great tasting food.  Unfortunately they missed their mark here.  The soup was fine, and the salad fresh! A fine amount of dressing too. (Perhaps they corrected themselves based on the past reviews).  However it was the steak that was disappointing. Even under the gravy and with the fries, it was hard to ignore the fact that the steak was pretty tough and dry.  The decor and service were good, which allows me to recommend the place for a novelty \"do-it-once since you're there\". But I don't see myself coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my boys and everyone devoured their speciality dish. Steak and skinny cut fries. Although the steak was a bit on the thin side, it was still tender and delicious. The fries was hot, crispy, and in abundance. The absolute best part of the dish is the gravy. The plate was clean when all was said and done. Service was good and the dessert was better. Two decent sized profiteroles with chocolate.   If I lived in town, I would come here again."}
{"text":"So good, so consistent. I have been here many times and have always had good service and a good plate of food. Their fries are amazing and I always order extra of their special sauce. The soup, salad and profiteroles that come with the table d'hote are always delicious.  I especially love that salad. Oh and they give you nice pieces of baguette as well, perfect to go with your soup."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. Excellent service, gave us time to sit and chat for a while before bringing desert. Loved the window seat."}
{"text":"Basic menu not much choices but it is ok with brassiere philosophy.Nice service above average meat quality.Better to go there for lunch or casual diner."}
{"text":"This place looks like an establishment... Lots of people here during lunch who were meeting.  It was a sophisticated feel.  There are only 6 options or so on the menu.  Depending if you want soup, salad, and dessert included in your meal.  The service was good and the ambiance elegant.  Perhaps it was an off day for the chef the day we went but I felt everything we tried starting with the soup was lacking salt.  I rarely reach for it but had to a few times during our meal.  But if you've had entrecote in France, you won't be disappointed or leave hungry here."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Lily. Believe all the reviews. The steak frites is fantastic. Today our soup was Carrot and it was outstanding. Ask for recommendations for apéritif , wine and after dinner cognac and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The fries is amazing. The steak is very good but I wouldn't say it is amazing. As a restaurant that is specialized in making steak it is lower than my expectation. (I.e. I can get a better steak with lower price somewhere else). I ordered two steaks for me and my wife and both were overcooked (medium rare but came up close to medium) .  Service wise... No service, but nothing bad as well. The servants literally just don't talk to you. They give menu, serve drinks, take order, take dishes... That's it. No extra words, no greeting, no disrespect.   However it is a place I will go back again."}
{"text":"Just had it. It's a good deal when it comes to the price. A soup+salad+steak with fries+dessert for around $40 per person (tax and tips included. However, nothing special for the food itself. The salad was just lettuce which pissed me off. The out-doors sitting is really nice. Peel-Maisonneuve intersection is one of the best locations in Montreal. Very elegant."}
