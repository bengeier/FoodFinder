{"text":"Small portions.  Overpriced.
Much much better italian food within walking distance.

Wanted to love this place because of its location but was let down by hefty bill after unsatisfying meal.

Feel sorry for people I see inside."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for Vittorio's and came for dinner on a Friday evening.  The walk from Rosedale station to the restaurant is a scenic one of beautiful, multi-million dollar houses.

There were 7 of us for dinner and we ordered 1) the lamb 2) mussels liguini 3) seafood linguini 4) the veal with marsala wine 5) the whole fish (bass) 6) calamari 7) pitcher of sangria.  We actually got a free dish - the red snapper on the house because they initially brought this out instead of the bass, which was very nice of them.

Out of all the dishes sampled - I like the lamb the best... and unfortunately that was the only dish that I did like.  

Everything else was just... ok.  The portions are tiny so although we didn't leave still hungry, we also didn't leave satiated.

Even with the groupon, it cost us $26 each.  I would've felt even more cheated if I had paid regular price for it.  

oh well, it was an experience. I don't think anyone in our group of seven will be a return diner."}
{"text":"Large portion sizes. Easy parking next door. Owner was a nice host. Would love to see live music. Overall the place is ok but good be better"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Vittorio's (although they're only open for dinner now). The hosts and servers were engaging, funny, and helpful. The pasta was...outstanding. It was a sausage and pepper on penne which just made my heart jump a little remembering the succulent spice. The succulent spice. Very good, Vittorio."}
{"text":"With a focus on old generation Italian style eating - this, is EXACTLY what we did kids. Exactly. what.we.did.

The restaurant is 2 floor with access to the roof that also works as a patio on the second floor.
We had the entire top section booked for a private party. This floor had it's own bar, bathroom and could easily fit 30 people. 

They were nice enough to provide the large party with a pre fix menu for $25.00
the table spread took you into an old Italian family dinner feel. Linen - white, 3 sets of forks, spoon & knives. Large salt&pepper shakers. Slender glass bottles of olive oil and 2 types of vinegar & balsamic. 
They had trays of sliced bread to keep everyone going before the orders and refilled as fast as they came. 

The staff is very generous and speedy on the service. They also placed extra care on accommodating food allergies etc. 

App choices: 
Cozze in Padella   
Fresh mussels in our tomato sauce - this was absolutely delicious. It was also my first time trying mussels. 

Insalata Caprese   
Salad with tomatoes, mozzarella, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil. - Pretty small portion for salad but not bad to have as an extra side.

Ficci alla Griglia   
Grilled Figs wrapped with prosciutto, balsamic reduction, strawberry couli - I have never had figs but it seemed to be saucy. The only complaint was that it wasn't enough to share. 

Melanzane alla Parmiggiana   
Baked eggplant topped with melted Parmesan cheese in tomato sauce  - this was extremely delicious. Even if you aren't a big fan of eggplant, you should try it out. The generosity with the cheese topping covers the eggplant allowed a juicy & chewy goodness all the way through. I especially liked the considerable oil control in this app. 

Dinner choices:
The Spaghettini con l'Aragosta
This was a big hit with seafood lovers. The massive spaghetti plate comes with 1/2 fresh Nova Scotian lobster cooked in fresh marinara sauce. The portion is way too big for one person so I would highly recommend sharing this.  

Vitello alla Sorrentina   
Scallopine Veal topped with eggplant, bufala mozzarella, tomato sauce - I was not a big fan of this. The veal wasn't as tender or maybe it was just the bite I tried out. But the portion was VERY tiny. 

Risotto Pollo e Funghi   
Arborio rice in wild mushrooms, cream sauce, grilled chicken breast, truffle essence  - This was the safest option for anyone who cannot ingest seafood or have texture issues. 

Gamberoni al Limone   
Sauteed tiger shrimps in a lemon white wine garlic sauce, fresh parsley -  This was also a big hit but after the 4 pieces, you will want to order more. 

Cappellacci di Zucca   
Stuffed homemade pasta with butternutsquash in a butter and sage sauce - I especially liked this. A few people in the party ended up ordering this as an app - which was really convenient if you. 
aren't into seafood. 

Desert choices: 
Creme brulee -  not the best but still a nice touch to finish up all the pasta/seafood mix.
strawberries / fruits - wasn't too 'yayy' about this. 

The drinks aren't included but I did notice that they were a bit stingy on the ratio of alc/syrup mix. My amaretto was very diluted. Wine bottles are served at the table so I would highly suggest ordering wine rather than a mix drink here. 

The bathrooms are adorable. 3 stalls with a weave basket for garbage and a tiny mirror. There was a cottage feel that really made it feel cozy. 


They accept all forms of payment but you have to pay your drink tab at the bar , separately from your diner tab. Albeit, this was only because we had the pre fix menu option.  

Over all, this corner house restaurant is a fun place for a large group and/or family affair. The seclusion to the rest of noisy Toronto also makes it an impressive private date night spot.

{"text":"So I came here again for lunch with a coworker, this time having one of their specials - the rack of lamb (yes, for lunch, that's how I roll).

The dish was spectacular and I absolutely loved it.

Service, as usual, is very relaxed and the hosts do not bother you."}
{"text":"I went there last night and was pleasantly surprised.  I haven't been to a fancy restaurant for a while because a lot of them have disappointed me.  First of all the service was great, people were very friendly and accommadating.  

And the seafood with linguine was fastastic.  Marinara sauce was perfect and the lobster, muscles, clams and calamari were nice and fresh.  None of the stale, frozen taste.  Later when we talked to the owner, it confirmed how the seafood was so fresh, he personally go to the market and pick out the freshest seafoord, meat and produce. We could feel he is really passionate about his restaurant business and extremely hands-on.  He has been in the business since he was 14, started out working at Vittorio when the original owner was alive.  After the owner died, owner's son fired him but years later, the restaurant went bankrupt so him and his wife spent their savings and bought the restaurant.  What a great story!"}
{"text":"Dined at this place for I bought the Dealicious coupon. When I read the other reviews here I thought \"Oh good, let's just get it over with.\" But I was actually quite impressed with Vittorio's after my dinner there. 
It is a little cosy place desirable for couples on dates. They have an acoustic guitar player singing at your table with nicely chosen songs. It was a little awkward when he approached us, for I was having a get-together with my female friend rather than being on a date. So instead of romantic songs, he chose an upbeat one that worked out splendidly. 
My friend and I thought the food was delicious, unlike what most of the folks thought here on Yelp. She had the roasted duck and I had the lobster linguine. The linguine served with half a lobster was exceptional. Yummy in my tummy! In addition to good food, the table service was fast and considerate. Honestly, if it wasn't for the slightly high price, I would have given Vittorio's five stars. 
I highly recommend this place for couples who look for evening dates with a little European culture, not for opposite-gender-friends-get-together. Unless there are already sparks between the two of you."}
{"text":"I bought one of those daily deal things for Vittorio's ($25 for $50 of food/drinks) and the menu looked good so I thought my boyfriend and I would check it out.

Well the food was incredible. Just amazing. We started with the beef carpaccio and he had the tilapia as his main and I the clam pasta. Everything was cooked perfectly with quality ingredients and was very impressive. As far as the atmosphere goes, the decor was great, modern yet classic and very romantic. The staff was also fantastic from our server to the bussers.

With all the good things I have to say, you're probably wondering why I didn't rate higher than 2 stars. Well as much as it pains me, and as much and I loved the food and service the one thing that would keep me from ever going back was the Mariachi Singer going table to table with his guitar. 

Don't get me wrong, the man was talented but I was there to have a nice quiet, romantic dinner, not to attend a concert. It was LOUD (to the point where I had to sit beside my boyfriend instead of across from him at our table just so we could have a conversation), it was disruptive and when he made his way to our table it was just plain awkward. Especially because our food arrived mid-song and neither of us felt comfortable enough to begin eating until he was finished. The owner seemed to really love the fact that this guy was around and was singing along with him (also annoying) but I'm thinking he just didn't have a clue. 

It's really unfortunate that such a distraction would take away from an otherwise great experience. If they lost the performer, I would be happy to return."}
{"text":"Went here as we have always passed by and been curious about the place, and I recently came into a free dinner-for-2 thing @ work for this place.  We went with some friends as well.

I had the Portobello mushrooms w/goat cheese starter which was good enough, but only had 1 serving of the mushroom - would it have killed them to put 2 on at least?  The dressing was tasty and the lettuce was fresh.

My main course was a rizzotto w/chicken.  The rizotto part was good, the chicken was dry and overcooked.  Honestly, how the hell do you screw up a chicken breast?

My wife had the Figg's and something starter, and her main dish was a rizzotto with Lobster - I tried each, and they were just OK, not bad, not great.

Service was decent, nothing special.  The girl who took care of us I could hardly understand what she said, she spoke so fast and the music was quite loud.

Would I return?  Only if I got some more free meals."}
