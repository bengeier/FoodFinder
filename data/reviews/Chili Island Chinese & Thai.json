{"text":"It is too bad that my review will echo what the majority of others have experienced here. Quick to seat for sure but then it is like you are invisible. Food is so-so for a place that appears nice - decor is great but that is it. By far the best deal is lunch bufffet. I have absolutely given up on evening meals here. Potential is great but falls way short."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I recommend the Salt & Pepper Seafood, preceded by either Hot & Sour or Corn & Chicken soup."}
{"text":"We had the salt and pepper squid ($15) and the Tom yum soup and hot and sour soup. Service was ok and food came fairly promptly.  An average experience."}
{"text":"We *just * ordered delivery from here and it was delicious!  Spicy Thai peanut chicken with peanuts is always my favorite and they did it really well! We also got the roast duck with mushrooms and oyster sauce,  green curry prawns, Cantonese chow mien (my husband's favorite even if we are eating Thai) with coconut rice and shrimp toasts.

Everything was delicious. The duck had the most flavorful sauce and had lots of mushrooms and green onions. It was cooked well, moist but not fatty. 
The curry prawns had great flavor, and were nice and big. The cantonese chow mien was good, lots of veggies and meat in it. I LOVE shrimp toasts. Love love love. These ones didnt have a ton of shrimp,  but they gave you lots of them, and were very tasty. I would get them again for the super delicious sauce they came with.  We got two orders of coconut rice to have lots left over. 

It was around the same price as ordering Chinese food, with plenty left over.  I am so excited for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food not bad service is horrid. This was our second attempt and it was awful. They have about 8 people working but no one serves."}
{"text":"Fine, but not great Thai food. The room and dishes are a little worse for wear but the service has been quick and quite friendly. Sadly the advertised lunch buffet is primarily Chinese Western classics with only one or two Thai dishes.

Pad Thai is a little saucy and a little sweet for my tastes, and the Swimming Rama is made with spinach, rather than Thai greens. However, portions are large and a curry and a coconut rice could easily feed two relatively hungry folks. Soups are good, both Tom Yum and a coconut curry, but I don't think in three trips that I've ever been served it in a bowl that didn't have a big chip out of it.

All told, three is actually a little generous but since I can't give a straight two and a half stars, and since the service is always friendly, and since there really isn't any better Thai (at least that I know of) in the area, I'll round up.

Don't go out of your way...but if you're in the neighborhood, it should be fine."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would!  Absolutely terrible food!  Low quality meats used and flavour was off.  Not worth the money.  Unfortunately the deep SE has no real options except for a couple very bad places!  Don't waste your money on this place!  We'll drive to Macleod Trail to get decent Chinese and Thai food!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service. The meal came out pretty quick and the staff were friendly. a lil divey, and also a lil pricey, but none the less it was tasty!

it also seemed like everything came out with some shrimp. im not sure if i missed that on the menu, or whether all their food includes a range of meats."}
{"text":"I've eaten dinner here twice, had the buffet twice, but mainly ordered takeaway. I prefer ordering takeaway the most. I usually order the dinner for two Thai style. I have two small kids, and find that there is enough food for all of us if you aren't huge eaters. It usually consists of fried rice, a coconut curry dish, mixed vegetables, two spring rollls. Oh yeah and some pork dish. Overall the food is okay. If you want better Chinese food, order from Bonavista Peking House. They have a minimum order amount if your not within a certain radius of their restaurant."}
{"text":"We usually order take-out from here and are consistently satisfied with the dishes.  The broccoli is always green, no yellow on it, which is a real plus.  No brown on the celery either.  Love the mushroom Egg Foo Yung."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant quite a bit whenever I am in the area. The staff is very friendly and the food is pretty good. I even left my purse there once over a weekend and they kept it safe for me when I came back! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Service is prompt, the owner is very friendly and most importantly, knows her menu really well. My friend had the wonton soup, which at under $6, is a steal.

I really wish the tofu curry didn't have canned bamboo shoots in it, though. It gave the curry the flavor of pepperoni, wrapped in a used jock strap, soaked in broth. Next time, I'll know to ask for it without."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place, went in at 12:45 for buffet (they close at 130) and there was NOTHING left... how can you run a buffet place with nothing to offer? Left and went directly beside it to Karma, where they are open an extra half hour and everything was full."}
{"text":"Living in the deep SE.. you have very limited options when it comes to Chinese take out. 

This definitely isn't the most authentic place - but that doesn't matter to me. The food is great! I love that it's a Chinese and Thai place - you can get a little taste of both.

They prepare the food quickly, and it's always piping hot when I open it up at home. My fave dishes are: Ginger chicken, cashew chicken, curry chicken (smells SOOO good!), veggie chow mein.. and yes PAD THAI. The fact that I can get both pad thai and chow mein excites me sooo much! 

I've eaten in a few times - the service is all right, but I prefer takeout better (especially since there's a 10% discount)

Not only that but they have a site with their menu which is very useful. 

It's a great value for your $! I'll definitely be ordering takeout again."}
{"text":"Came in at 11:45am on a Friday, just before lunch and the place was empty...   uh oh.   This restaurant is in a busy shopping area... it should be busy.  I checked Yelp and found quite a few negative reviews.    It smells good in here and the prices on the lunch menu are super low, so I decided to risk it.   I ordered yellow chicken curry for $7.95 and modified my order for no bell peppers.  The empty room leads me to believe that the negative reviews have been deserved, so I am happy to say that my lunch was great!  My food arrived quickly and accurate to my modifications. The yellow curry was sweet and quite hot, the veggies were cooked but still crisp, and the chicken was nicely cooked, too.   Perhaps I just got lucky, but maybe the restaurant has learned from previous mistakes and stepped up their game.  I'll remain mildly skeptical until I've returned again to the same quality, but I was pleased with my lunch today."}
{"text":"Just finished eating my takeout!! The staff was welcoming and I had no issues on the phone. I got the Crispy chicken, pad thai, swimming rama(my favourite) and 2 coconut rices. It took longer than told by about 5 minutes(that's why i only gave them 4 stars). But the food was great. Even after my 15 minute drive the crispy chicken was still crispy! The swimming rama was delicious it's portion sizing was definitely worth it, and the sauce was just amazing. The coconut was rich and creamy, it usually comes in a small container but i guess if you order 2 they give u a big one. The pad thai had a bit too much sauce but it was still nice.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place if you have some time. Last time I came here they were late about 15 minutes, so just be aware."}
{"text":"My SO and I wanted to go for Thai food, and we knew Chili Island was close to home. So we headed there for dinner. We were not impressed. First, the service was subpar. It took over twenty minutes to get our drink order in. After this, the service picked up substantially.

THe food was also subpar. The Thai food was spicey but not flavourful, and its flavours all blended together."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese and not many places around here for that but I was pleasantly surprised probably some of the best ginger beef and sweet and sour pork I've had. I was disappointed by their shanghai noodles but would try them again may have just had a bad order. I had ordered takeout and it was near impossible finding a spot but that's alright there's lots of restaurants around so I can see how it gets packed. Their prices were very reasonable for Chinese takeout and it was also very fast! Next time I will get delivery to save the parking headache!"}
{"text":"Three words say it all: Well that sucked.

Seriously don't mean to be rude but when you pay $30 for Pad Thai that looks like it drowned in BBQ sauce (I swear I smelled ketchup) and for a noodle concoction that promises to be gluten free, you would expect a bit better quality than what was 'served'. 

We had originally headed out to wipe the week away and visit my new favourite Indian addiction, only to discover it was closed. After a few minutes we decided to try this place out because....well, because it was convenient. We enter, sit down and start to read our menus when what to my wandering eyes do I see? An ant trap. An ANT TRAP! I should have kicked my feet, stomped them hard to make my hubby run off with me in disgust, but he did the next best thing; he switched spots with me. Trust me dear reader...this foreshadowing.

As our server came by to take our orders, I made certain I wasnt to have gluten. Having recently been diagnosed with an intolerance, I haven't eaten out at a new place in a while, and I get a wee bit gun shy in the face of uncertainty. After our food came (not served at the same time I might add), hubby pushed his 'rice noodles in BBQ sauce soup' around and after roughly 7 bites, he pushed it away in disgust and I shared with him my 'gluten free' meal.

If anyone had come to ask how our meal was, maybe hubby would have said something, but in the end paid for the meals, simply didn't want to get into anything. As he paid, not a sound was heard from the woman behind the counter. Not a \"how was your meal\" or anything. Didnt speak a word...

We walked to the door, and my face lit on fire with an immediate fever and that only happens when there's gluten in the meal. In the gluten free meal....

So as I type, I'm cranky with fever and a cold ice pack on my head trying to keep the heat down and the nausea at bay.

All in all, Yelpers, dont ever go to this restaurant. EVER. In fact, Im bummed I had to give it a star....I want to give it negative stars....

Oh and post script?  Hubby swooshed an ant off the table but didn't tell me till we were in the car. Even the ant trap sucked."}
{"text":"2018. 03.19. After the work, my boyfriend took me to Chili Island Chinese & Thai Restaurant for dinner. It was our first time having a dinner at this restaurant. We had such great experience there.  Chili Island Chinese & Tai Restaurant is located on 130 Ave SE Calgary, which is nearby Cora breakfast and Kiro Sushi. We have been to that area so many times. It was our first time walking into this place. Chili Island Chinese & Thai Restaurant is an Asian restaurant. It serves Chinese and Thai food.

Environment

We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. It was not busy at all. Inside the restaurant was nice and clean. There were lots of space. We could very easy to find a seat.

Server

After we arrived the restaurant, the server led us to the table. Then, she brought the menu to us. The menu was very simple with images which are easier for us to order the food. The server was very nice and friendly. She brought the drink to us and begin to take the order.

Food

Since it was our first time, we would like to try lots of different dishes. After discussed with each other, we have decided to order Chinese Dish Combo Dinner for two. The dinner included Two spring rolls, ginger beef, sweet sour pork, fresh mixed vegetables and chicken fried rice. Also, we had Banana milkshake to share. The food came out the kitchen one by one. All the dishes were fresh and well cooked. They were all very tasty.

Prices

Because of the combo, the price of the food was OK. It was not expensive. Everything all together cost us 40 dollars. We still had lots of food take to go. Not bad.

In summary, we enjoyed our dinner at Chili Island Chinese & Thai Restaurant. We would like to go back there again sometimes in the future."}
{"text":"We have been eating here since it opened about 10 years ago, a couple off dishes over that time but consistently good food at a reasonable price in the area.  Have always had good service, fresh made food, and they will cook to order if you want to change it up a little.  Owner always recognizes and acknowledges us.  Would recommend to try this place out.

Take out is quick and you don't have to wait until 4pm like other places.  Containers are packed as full as they can be, portions are large given the lower prices than others in the area.

They used to have a lunch buffet for about $10 which gave you a lot of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Chili Island was the last place I ate at during my latest trip to cowtown. I was coming back from Kicking Horse and hadn't ate pretty much all day, so that's why we ordered so much for two. That sounds like a reasonable excuse right? Haha, that and we just over order in general whenever I eat out with my sis.

Normally, I'm not a fan of restaurants that combine cuisines (Chinese and Thai aren't even close to being similar cuisines but let's not go there). However, my sis likes it and frequents it almost on a monthly basis so that says something. The owners/waitress/cook, I think they do it all, are super sweet and speak Chinese (and probably Thai for that matter). I read a few reviews after my visit and yes, the service is on the slow side but hey, go on a Sunday evening and you won't feel rushed. I was surprised by how big the restaurant is inside and wonder how busy they normally get. Alas, on to the food.

- Peek kai yod sai (#3) ($12.95) - you get four massive pieces of Thai stuffed chicken wings. These were friggin' amazing. WOW. And the sauce it came with, it's off-the-charts good. Welcome to spicy, flavour town. ORDER these immediately.
- Chili Island's seafood platter (#23) ($17.95) - a generous amount of seafood (shrimps, mussels, squid, scallops) along with a some red and green peppers and onions. Everything was bathed in a fragrant, spicy sauce. Went very well with the coconut rice.
- Singapore fried rice noodles (#86) ($10.95) - Singaporean noodles is pretty much a staple whenever I eat out with my sister. This one was pretty typical. My sis wanted this over trying their pad thai.
- 2x Coconut milk rice (#76) ($1.95 each) - yes please, seriously, can you ever go wrong with coconut rice? Methinks not. Plus that was just rhetorical. Obviously, coconut rice is the way to go. Creamy, flavourful rice.

Decent Thai/Chinese spot in the deep corner of Calgary's SE sector. Probably not something I would specifically drive out of the way for but if you're in the area, Chili Island hits the spot."}
{"text":"Run by the same people that operate some Chinatown restaurants, they know how to turn out a good dish.  You're going to pay a premium for the convenience of having it close to home though, these are definitely way above Chinatown prices."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here and were pleased with the food. It is reasonably priced and the portions were huge. We ordered Pad Thai and a Currry chicken dish, Between my wife and myself we had a lot left over. Enough for my lunch the next day.  It was not the best Thai food I have ever had, but was tasty and not oily. Overall we liked the food and giant portions and will order from here again."}
{"text":"Chicken that I swear wasn't chicken, and beef that certainly wasn't beef. Overall the worst Chinese I've ever had. Save your money. Order elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've given these guys a couple of tries now. The first was probably a year ago when we got a menu in the mail and ordered delivery. The food was just ok and there's many other places in the area that have better Chinese food in the area.

A couple weeks ago we gave them another try, this time actually going into the restaurant. When we arrived at prime dinner time we were the only ones in the restaurant. The hostess told us to choose where we wanted to sit and brought us some menus. It was a little bit of a wait before she brought us water, but when she dropped of the waters she didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink. After going through the menu she took our drink and food order. 

The good came quickly and again was just \"OK\". While we were eating another couple came in who seemed to be regulars and sat directly in the booth behind us. A completely empty restaurant and they choose that booth. I find it odd, but it's fine, except that the booths are a little wobbly so you feel the other person when they sit down or move.

After the server brought us our boxed up leftovers and the bill she disappeared for a very long time. After being thoroughly annoyed I went up to the bar to pay and still waited another couple of minutes. I don't know if there was a big take-out order in the kitchen or what was happening but there were no staff in the front of the house for almost 10 solid minutes.

I'm guessing their lunch buffet must do well for them because with the mediocre food and lack of customer service I can't understand how these guys have lasted so many years."}
