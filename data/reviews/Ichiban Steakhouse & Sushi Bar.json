{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place. The rolls are always well made, fresh, and delicious. They also usually have 1 or 2 nightly special rolls that are creative and fun. The service is friendly and always accommodating if I want to sub something in a roll. Ella, in particular, is a great server. I don't typically get the hibachi but every time I do, the food is excellent and the portions are huge. The bar is well stocked and drink prices are reasonable. Also, the weekday lunch specials are a steal! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good sushi and good hibachi north of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Poor service, and below average food.  The hostess was nice enough as she seated us, but the girl that waited on us did not smile once, and was very unpleasant. The chicken katsu was dry and overcooked.  The teriyaki chicken was cold, and jelly like, as if it was made an hour prior to us ordering it.  I think it's pretty difficult to screw up teriyaki chicken, but they somehow managed.  Very disappointing, especially given their high prices.  Sushi Tomo a few miles down the road on McKnight was considerably better, and a bit less expensive too.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the sushi here, but I don't think I will be back to try it anytime soon."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our Hibachi cook today.  50% of the reason we go to a hibachi place is the chef and the entertainment.  It was our daughter's birthday and she picked this place to enjoy the fire, the volcano, the guy who shoots water.  Our chef rushed through the whole service, spraying my daughter with oil (thank goodness it was the first step to prepping the grill and not hot yet ), getting egg shells in the egg...  When I asked him to slow down, that my daughter loved the onion volcano and it was her birthday... he ignored me and continued to rush through the cooking.  The usual experience of spinning spatulas, spinning eggs, flipping shrimp, a flaming stacked onion volcano, the little guy who squirts water- we got NONE of that.  It was insulting and crushing to my kids, who look forward to the experience.  Even the other diners with us said it was disappointing.  Next time we'll try Saga."}
{"text":"Overall the food was delicious, but my steak was overcooked and it was a little burnt. The chef was showing his skills and dropped his tools multiple times. The restaurant was clean, which is good."}
{"text":"Not that good took a vey long time and the fire scared my young ones they have food poisoning and their was a 30 minute wait for somewhere that wasn't good all my buddies hate it too"}
{"text":"Seriously Ichiban. Please cut UP the iceberg BEFORE you serve it to your loyal customers. I throughly enjoy Ichiban Steakhouse, however, I am absolutely appalled at this scene.  I have no words."}
{"text":"I went mid week, I was worried because it was quiet inside, but the food was great. I had sushi rolls, split about six different rolls with a friend. All were delicious, and even though I was so full I wanted more.  The fish tasted fresh and the plates were beautifully arranged. I was expecting less, and got more. I would recommend this place for a low key sushi night.  I'm giving three stars because I'm big on ambiance, and wasn't feeling that here."}
{"text":"I've gone a couple more times and must say, 2/3 times I've sat at the hibachi. I would say for the best experience sit down as there is never a wait, plus extra menu options!  Service is always friendly, we went in half an hour before closing and everything still came out in good time, quality, ect. Kudos to serving us so late!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since they opened, and we still love this place for lunch. Where else can you get a main course with a side of noodles, fried rice, vegetables, salad, and soup for around $12 to $13? Unlike it's sister resturant in Cranberry, this location is rarely crowded. At this point we aren't in it to be entertained by the cook, we are solely here to feed our faces! We always walk out with a full belly and a take out box. If you like hibachi but don't like the expense then go during lunch hours from 11 to 230. If you go for dinner be prepared to pay at least $20 or more (usually more) for about the same amount of food you get during the day. The only difference is that you receive 2 pieces of shrimp for an appetizer. We are always pleased!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Fun chefs. Perfect for family outings. Can seat up to many and kids would love it here. I highly recommend this place over saga."}
{"text":"I've been to their other location so I decided to try this one and I have to say this place is equally as impressive as the other locations. The host at the front is very friendly and welcoming. The hostess is also very friendly and the Hibachi chef was very professional and put on a great show.   Now to the reason people go to restaurants; the food. The food quality at these Ichiban restaurants is always outstanding. You can taste the freshness in their fish and their vegetables. Especially considering their prices the food is well worth the money. I would recommend getting the rock shrimp for appetizer because it's amazing. I got filet and scallop for Hibachi and it was cooked to perfection in front of me. Overall you can go to any Ichiban Restaurants and know that you will get some amazing food."}
{"text":"Having been here a few times I find the \"routine\" of the chefs to be a bit predictable and bland. Even so, it's a fun dining experience and the food makes me hungry just typing about it. The wait staff is attentive when you're there, however they won't seat you until your whole group arrives. We always order the chicken hibachi, which gets you rice, noodles, veggies, and (of course) chicken. Everything is made right in front of you, so you know exactly what you're eating. I can't speak highly enough about the food here - it's simply delicious. If you've not had the hibachi experience, do yourself a favor and give it a try.   Tip: Split a hibachi meal with your date. It's cheaper (basically the cost of 1.5 meals) and the only difference we notice is one less shrimp! JUST A SHRIMP! We still leave rolling out and bursting at the seams."}
{"text":"We have dined at Ichiban several times in the last year, and it is by far the best Japanese restaurant we've been to. Better than Saga and Benehana. Even on weekends, there is never too long of a wait by the door, and the restaurant is very family-friendly. Although the food may seem a little expensive, it is very good, and the portion sizes are so massive, the leftovers will be enough to take home and make another meal of."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is fantastic - I have gone multiple times and never been disappointed. Absolutely delicious. Definitely give this place a shot if you're looking for some good sushi. The drinks are good too!"}
{"text":"It was totally chaos and mass confusion and I videotaped the whole cooking escapade but I need to figure out my damn Galaxy 8 to show you"}
{"text":"Hibachi, HALF PRICED! WOW   What a deal! So much food, and extremely delicious. A local favorite that always is filled from 12-3pm."}
{"text":"OK for a hibachi grill, food was good but the service/chef was very average. For the price I expected more."}
{"text":"Took my family of 5 here for valentines day. I bought a groupon listing exclusions only of 12/24-1/1. As we were seated I showed our server my groupon ($30). She said they don't take groupons. We asked to speak to manager. He said we don't take groupons today. We tried to show him that the only exclusions were Christmas and New Years. He said he didn't care & he stated he would not read it it didn't matter what it said.  Finally the owner came out & very reluctantly agreed to honor it. The service was good & the food was fine. California rolls were great. Disappointed in the chef. All he did was cook. Other tables were getting a much better show. For 5 of us (3 children) we spent $100.  Hardly worth the 20 min it took to resolve the groupon issue. They did offer to refund the $15 I paid for it. Won't be back. The manager was rude. We have always gone to cranberry. We'll continue going there."}
{"text":"I've dined here 4 times and each time the food and service were great! The salad dressing, noodles and dipping sauces are all delicious. I usually get the chicken hibachi, but I had the steak tonight and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for her first hibachi experience. It took a while to get started because we had to wait for a Chef to become available. My mom doesn't like dressing on her salad, so it would have been nice to get a salad without the dressing.  Otherwise, it was a typical hibachi experience, and a good first time for my mom. The price isn't too bad since you get so much food, but definitely can't do hibachi too often on a budget."}
{"text":"Great food..great show...great service...its Friday night regular wait at any restaurant that you would expect...the people r super nice and the food its legit good..always worth a trip when I am in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Japanese hibachi restaurants, and Ichiban is no different. The food is great, but same tricks when the chef cooks - all hibachi chefs must have the same trick book. It is a bit pricier than the ones I have been to, but they also serve you noodles, which I've never experienced. The dish was great, but the chicken was a little too 'saucy.' Overall, Ichiban gives you the typical Japanese hibachi experience.   PS: There are no lunch specials during the weekends. We were charged dinner prices during our Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"I don't like their sauces too much, compared to Miyako.  However, I do like their one sushi roll called Natku (something like that, but it has jalapeno, white tuna, and sriracha).  The one thing I like about this Hibachi compared to others is they don't dice up the shrimp.  Yes, they give you whole ones - which makes me feel less ripped off.  It comes with soup AND salad AND fried rice AND noodles AND vegetables.  I love their ginger dressing on the salad. The salad nice and crispy, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I'm responsible for hospitality at my company and order Ichiban take-out regularly. It's always the Hibachi Lunch and we have yet to be disappointed. For the price, you can't beat the selection and quantity of food provided. They're always friendly and always very accurate. I rely on my vendors to provide quality service and Ichiban delivers. My only request is that you hook up with the Uber to provide delivery cuz I'm getting lazy in my golden years!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch today 9/17/13 and was extremely disappointed.  The staff did not smile, were not friendly.  We wanted a take out order with our lunch and had to explain it at least 3 times. The worst was the cook, who in the middle of starting the vegetables, placed the raw chicken in the grill and took the cooking utensil and distributed the noodles to 3 small children with raw chicken juice on it.  I could not believe he did that.  He then cut up the raw chicken and distributed the vegetables also with this utensil.  I have been to many Hibachi Restaurants and this is not the steps of the cooking process.  I just hope none of them get sick. I think there needs to be more training with the waitress and cook staff, if you are going to stay open and not cause severe illnesses to your customers and improve staff response to customers when greeting them. We will never be back nor advise anyone to go there."}
{"text":"We went there for my wife's birthday and the service was great.  We made a reservation for the Hibachi (the only part you need a reservation for) and went right in.  Shortly, they had our order and the chef came out and was cooking.  The food was very good and we had a great time.  The only bad side was that they charge you for what they call a \"Birthday special\".  It's $8 for a small fizzing firework in some flowers (they keep the flowers) and then the birthday person gets some ice cream.  Had I known this, we would not have requested it.  We were surprised because this was the first place where we were served lo mein noodles with the Hibachi.  It was nice and added to the meal."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the seizure-inducing celebratory disco lights were just awful."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and customer service is very good. However, they need more chefs for the Hibachi!"}
{"text":"This is the fourth location I've tried.  It's new, and clean and the food was good...  The \"show\" was not.  I think I get it.  We were put at a table with 5 junior high/high school kids, and I don't know if maybe the chef thought...\"these kids are never going to appreciate the show...and even if they do they won't tip\" or what.  He cooked our food.  That's it.  My daughter was with us and she still loved watching it all unfold, but after he'd cleaned up for the evening, and moved to the next hibachi over from ours, we watched as he went through each and every trick I knew them typically to perform...out of the corner of my eye I saw him catch and spin the egg...then expertly split it over his spatula.  I saw him flourish his cooking implements, break out the little peeing plastic boy, light the volcano, flip food into people's mouths...etc.  We didn't get that treatment.  I get it.  Nobody relishes the idea of doing \"all that work\" and not getting the tip to match...but hey...that's your job, dude.  Make the most of it.  Do your best, put in the effort.  The food was good.  Really enjoyed it.  If it would have been less than good this would have dropped to a two."}
{"text":"They are so nice at the sushi bar, they will give you an amazing appetizer, normally! Sushi is fresh and amazing! The spicy mayo is great with and the hibachi is amazing and funny with great food and sauces! You might get lost in the sauce."}
{"text":"I came here for Hibachi and have to start by saying I was really disappointed in the show.  I mean, the chef did one or two small tricks and that was it.  I'll get to the food shortly, but I could have saved myself time and money by just ordering stir fry.    Now to the food... while not quite their saving grace, the portions are big.  You get 2 shrimp, soup, salad, fried rice, and noodles to go with your selected meats.  It is all good, but nothing was great.  I also shared a specialty sushi roll (Natsu) and have to say it was great!  Service was friendly, but slow.  In fact, compared to the chef flying in and out (see the no show bit above), the rest of the service seemed to take a lifetime.  I've been told they offer Groupons quite often, so keep an eye out for a good deal if you'd like to give them a try..."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sushi area only.  (I cannot comment on the Hibachi bar.)  The Sushi however is top notch.  It is consistently the best I have had in the Pittsburgh area - the Wexford location in particular.  Fresh, high quality ingredients and very well made and presented.  A nice big variety too.  I only miss Inari and a few of the specialty rolls I used to get at Kotobuki.  I feel bad that the Sushi chef's reputations might suffer because people don't care for the Hibachi.  5 Star Sushi"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious food for a hibachi place.  Love the fried rice and the noodles.  Oh the noodles.  They are so, so good.  I usually get the steak and shrimp which I always find perfectly cooked and the steak is never tough.  They do offer an upgrade to filet mignon but I find the cheaper steak to be pretty darn delicious.  Love their dipping sauce, though I do tend towards the pink shrimp sauce more than the brown soy based sauce for the steak.  The bar is a little on the small side but the bartenders are always more than helpful and definitely know how to make a delicious drink.  Some of their drinks can be a little too syrupy and a little light on the booze, but usually I enjoy my drink.  The show definitely depends a little on the chef and a LOT on the crowd.  I've always gone with a big group that gets their own hibachi table.  When we are paying attention and into the show, it is always much more interactive and entertaining.  When there are children present, they also seem to play up to the kids a bit.  If we are talking amongst ourselves, then the show seems to decrease a bit, which I can't say I can blame them.  Definitely come sometime for a birthday.  Yeah, it's cheesy, but who doesn't love some birthday sprinklers and disco balls!?!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak house and hibachi i have been to. Hosts and servers are attentive. Food is fresh and affordable at the same time. I come here very often to get my lunch, i love the lunch special menu cause i get a good portion of my favorite food for even cheaper. Sometimes i even get to see famous sport players that come and dine here. Love this restaurant. If you haven't try this place, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times and have never have a bad meal. Always excellent. More than enough food for the price. Rice and noodles come with meal. Great place all around."}
{"text":"We went to Ichiban in Wexford to celebrate our daughter's birthday. There were 7 of us. She had the \"free birthday dinner' coupon. They would not allow her to use it even though there were 7 of us. They said she had to have 6 persons on her check. Really disappointing. The food was average. They were not very busy. I'm guessing the place has lost his charm. Our next celebration will be somewhere else. (Usually there is 14 of us.) This restaurant needs to learn customer service. They never increase business handling customers in that manner. Seven customers tell seven more customers and before you know it, it's posted on facebook where hundreds see the comments!  PS Tried to post on their facebook page and they deleted my comments twice. Says a lot for how they handle disappointed customers."}
{"text":"While you get a lot if food, the quality of the beef has a lot to be desired   We went using a Groupon. I don't think we'll go back with out another one. The kids like the food and show.  The service was good"}
{"text":"ew. I've gotten the chef named Evan multiple times and overtime he doesn't cook the fucking food all the way through. he's very lazy about his work. they must fire him in order to get a better review from me. it isn't even just him. the past couple times the food has just been off. plus its wayyyyyyy expensive."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Ichiban Steakhouse & sushi, I've ever been to. Their service is awesome and food is fantastic.. I highly recommend this place for all occasions from catering to great family dinner."}
{"text":"I always love to come here for the rock shrimp, tempura vegetable, crab rangoons, and fried rice. It is sooooo good. Great place to eat and good service. I haven't tried the hibachi table yet."}
{"text":"Looks, smells and sounds like Japan! I have never even been to Japan! That's something that I dig about this place. You don't have to know anything about the country to experience its culture. The hibachi cooks know what they're doing, and they entertain you more than a clown does at a kids party. The opening fire on the grill had me sweating like a dog in a Chinese restaurant, except this was a Japanese one. Sorry not sorry for the racial pun, Asia. The cook said he has been doing hibachi for 15 years. The red snapper was quite enjoyable, and you can't forget the mini steaming volcano he makes out of a chopped onion!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and sadly this was the worse experience I've ever had here or at any Japanese steak house. After waiting about 15 minutes for our table (normal) on a Wednesday night, our party of 4 was sat with a party of 6 so everyone was crammed in together with no room for anyone. We waited another 15 for anytime to come and acknowledge our table.  During dinner we had to ask 3 times for forks to eat our meal. The bill was wrong. Service was very slow and not worth the money tonight. We come here a few times a month with both of our kids but with the long wait and over 2.5 hours to complete our meal the adults and kids were a wreck. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The sushi is always always delicious. But, after ordering takeout tonight, I am extremely dissatisfied because of the calamari portion given. The calamari appetizer is usually quite large. Tonight I was given literally 7 pieces of calamari. Extremely disappointed in tonight's takeout from what is usually a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I bought two coupons here through Double Take Deals and the manager at this restaurant redeemed both on one visit while only giving me credit for one.  He refused to admit the possibility of a mistake so I am left assuming it was fraud.   The attitude was definitely \"screw the customer\".  I WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"So a friend and I were up here for a doctors appointment and we both just happened to be craving Hibachi. She had been here and I had yet to visit this establishment so I said why not.  We both decided to get the Teriyaki Chicken. I'm not much of a soup person but my friend really liked it. I enjoyed the salad (basically just iceberg lettuce) and absolutely loved the ginger house dressing. We both absolutely loved the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and had a great teriyaki flavor.  We also tried the dragon roll. We both absolutely loved that as well and both actually wanted to order a second roll (we were both too full to do so though :( ).   The service was ok, we were seated right away but it took a while to get our drinks and later some yum yum sauce. Our waitress was very nice so I just assume they were busy."}
{"text":"Walked in at 6pm on a Tuesday and was seated at the sushi bar.  I left at 6:15 after no one ever came over to even take our drink order. We informed the hostess but she seemed completely uninterested.  The place was dead as you would expect on a Tuesday. We walked to the pizza place a few doors up.  Poor service, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Enjoyable place to get hibachi. I have only ever gone here for hibachj, I have never gone for a regular meal. The hibachi tastes good and is entertaining."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Japanese Steakhouses and Ichiban ranks the highest in my book. The shrimp sauce is unbelievable. None of the other Japanese restaurants even come close.   This particular one has a friendly staff and the dinning area was clean. The cook was entertaining and our kids really enjoyed it.   You really can't go wrong with anything here. I've eaten steak, shrimp, lobster, chicken and they were all excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is always good, the staff is attentive, and the cooking is entertaining.  Prices are reasonable for the freshness and quality.  It's one of the few places my niece and nephew will clean their plates too!!"}
