{"text":"We don't have many Portuguese restaurants in San Diego and this place was an unexpected surprise. The food is amazing! The chicken and poutine fries were delicious. The olives & beans tapa and the bread were also throughly enjoyed. The service was friendly and attentive. I highly recommend and am looking forward to visiting Montreal again to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Bonne accueil. La soupe au poulet et l'assiette de tapas succulent. Pour le dessert de délicieux natas."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening, not very busy, 1~2 more tables besides us. Had high expectations from the reviews. Service was attentive, though a bit slower than ideal. Food looks great (thus even higher expectations) but they all taste similar, too greasy and salty to our liking.   (Fyi we ordered: grilled shrimp, sardine tapas; meat combo of chicken and choricou.   We asked to switch chicken breast with legs but still got the breast. I guess we would have enjoyed it more with legs )"}
{"text":"Cute little cozy restaurant located on henri bourassa. The apetizer tastes great along with the bread. Amazing taste for the chicken and even better sweet potato fries! Definitely a place to come back too."}
{"text":"Good quality Delicious food Good service We ordered a half chicken spicy and chicken breast with sweet potatoes . They were absolutely fresh and spicy. I like spicy food and it was good for me"}
{"text":"Le poulet est bien aprété . Pas piquant , mais le gont est très bon.  Bon nouveau restaurant ."}
{"text":"Porto Poulet is the kind of place you really have to know about to notice. Crammed between a driving school and an abandoned corner store, it's easy to miss.  However, don't be so quick to judge because their Portuguese-styled charcoal-cooked Piri Piri chicken is absolutely delicious. I live nearby and never get tired of the amazing smell. Their most popular dish is the Family Combo, which is a full chicken, with salad and fries, suitable for 4 persons that can be spicy or not, to your liking. But they also offer a lot of other options.  Inside, there are about five or six little tables, and a TV, but I don't really recommend eating there. It's more a takeout kind of restaurant. The place is so small, sometimes the charcoal smoke gets kinda suffocating. It is worth noting that you call and have your order prepared in advance."}
{"text":"Got Uber eats from here. Everything was delicious! We had 2 orders of the quarter chicken dinner, their house sauce was 50 cents extra but was delicious! The chicken was not dry at all and was juicy, and same with the wings. We also ordered the Portuguese tarts which came warm still and super yummy. We placed a second order of the night just for the tarts!"}
{"text":"There is 'f' all for good delivery in Cartierville neighborhood, however Porto is fresh newcomer that does Portuguese chicken pretty well, fries are awesome, salad has room for improvement.  Beats driving out to Ma Poule Mouillée, and their delivery time is surprisingly quick."}
{"text":"The venue is small (6 tables). The staff is so nice though. Unlike most other portuguese chicken spots, they served tapas and a bread basket before the meal. The salad was served separate from my chicken and fries; which was unfortunate.   But the sweet potato fries!!! They are so Good. The BEST ive ever had."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the chicken breast and sweet potatoes. Food was very good! Chicken tasted like authentic Portuguese and I'd see myself coming back to have it again. The sweet potatoes was amazing however! Overall I was very happy with what I ate.  Couple of cons however...  Price-tag is a little high and while the chicken and sweet potatoes were good, I was hoping for a little more in my plate for the price. I also wanted Pasteis de Natas to bring back with me but they were 2.25 each... and $21 for a dozen. Sorry but that's quite expensive! I could easily get a dozen under $15 elsewhere.   I would consider this place more for takeout than for eating in. The place could use a little bit of of a makeover with its cracked tiles, open washroom door, cheap divider to the bathroom, things stacked in corners, no AC... these little things matter if you plan to have patrons dine here. At least to me!  Beyond that service was friendly albeit the food took 20 minutes to be prepared. We were 1 of the 2 tables used for lunch.. so I guess that's why it took longer than expected.  In conclusion I recommend visiting and grabbing some food here and bringing it home. More for takeout. Porto Portugal is solid Portugal cuisine albeit with a higher than expected price-tag for certain items in their menu."}
{"text":"Finally a Portuguese grilled chicken place opens near my place : ) It's small great for takeout, but if you want to eat there they have a few tables.  They specialize in piri piri chicken, and fans of the dish won't be disappointed.  They don't offer delivery yet, but I thing they are planning to.  Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Favorite Portuguese in the city, staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. The chicken is cooked to perfection and the rice is incredible. The selection of Portuguese beverages and desserts are some of the best in the city. I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this place but I was unfortunately not that impressed with the food. If I'm going to eat Portuguese food I still prefer Braseiro on St-Laurent or Chez Doval on Marie-Anne."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! I had never had Portuguese food before and I wanted to try it since that's my ancestry. So amazing and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Pour le coin c'est une bonne adresse à retenir si le creux de poulet portugais vous prend subitement. Le piquant est tres bon demandez en en extra ;)"}
