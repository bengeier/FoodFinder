{"text":"La Brioche is beautiful inside.  The food is good, borderline great.  The baked goods and cakes look better.  However, I will NEVER be able to get over how HORRIBLE the service is.  I have given La Brioche my \" 3 strikes\" policy, hoping that the bad service might be a fluke, but by reading the other reviews and by my own experiences, it seems like a trend.  The servers look like they are on a fast sinking ship, they are totally unaccommodating, totally rude and need to study up on what they are serving.   I feel like if the service is bad, why bother trying to make everything else great. I give La Brioche one star and I think I am being very generous. I feel like no matter how good an establishments food is, if the service is not up to par, it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Maybe you're not supposed to visit a restaurant an hour before they're about to close, but we stopped in for a quick bite of late lunch this weekend.  What a (pricey) mistake.  Their weekend menu is really lacking, but the BF and I found something to satisfy our light hunger.  After returning to ask what I had ordered, we did not see the waitress again until she plopped the bill on our table.  No water refills, no coffee refills, no asking how the food was (not great--over-poached eggs on the benedict, and WAY overly spiced squash soup).  The size of my portion of soup was wrong (I had wanted a cup and received a bowl).    Despite trying to get her attention as she passed by our table a half dozen times, I was unable to notify the waitress that she had my order wrong and that I would really love a glass of water.  When she passed by the last time and saw my BF with his card in hand she suddenly noticed us...not that she asked how anything was.  I didn't even get a chance to see if we were charged for a bowl of soup instead of a cup because she snatched the card up before we had the opportunity.    I get that it's a Sunday afternoon and you probably just want to go home.  That's no excuse for treating your restaurant patrons as if they're burdens.  We spent $27 on a \"quick bite\" when we could have gone to Panera, had great service and walked out $15 richer.    Unreal.  At least I'll never again have to face the always full parking lot to eat at this pretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"I am always trying new places in the Madison area for brunch, La Brioche continues to top the list.  The ingredients are consistently high quality and fresh, locally sourced.  Never been disappointed in anything I have tried.  Service is always good.  Love the french bistro inspired decor, very eclectic and elegant.  Live piano music adds a nice touch.  Not sure why some of the negative reviews, I used to live in a large city and La Brioche is definitely on par with the types of more upscale bistros I could find there.  If you are looking for classy, high quality spot for brunch then La Brioche won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ubaldo Mora is a magician. We went non-traditional with a chocolate mocha cake. It could not have been more moist and more beautiful. He knew exactly what our vision was for our cake, executed it perfectly, was very pleasant to work with, and ultra professional."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Have made two visits, great ambiance, food, and service.  The spinach omlette is excllent.  French toast to die for.  They can be busy, but accurate in estimating wait time.  Outside tables & chairs will be great in warm weather."}
{"text":"Okay, so we went here during summer restaurant week -- so I feel a bit bad scoring so low.  But, we went on Thursday night...they had 5 days to perfect the food right?  WRONG! The food did not taste remotely good. Everything was so bland, no flavor at all.  I was so disappointed that we spent $50 on our meals.  Every course was disappointing I had the Gazpacho to start as an appetizer while hubby had corn fritters.  Mine was bland and tasteless, said it had avocado in it...literally like 2 small chunks.  The corn fritters were globs of grease, just gross.  Dinner I had potato dumplings with veggies..just bland, nothing exciting.  Hubby had olive oil poached halibut..again nothing to write home about, and very small portion.  Desserts were no better, which we were expecting to be since La Brioche does in fact have a great bakery.  The best part of the meal was the bread basket...how sad. Our server had no personality or charm -- I even asked her if she was sick of restaurant week or what...she just grunted something back.  La Brioche True foods = Truely disappointing."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food is always very good. I agree with some of the reviewers that have found the service to be less than endearing. Today (Sunday 1:00PM) the wait was 30 minutes and the waiting area can be claustrophobic. Our server was perhaps a bit stressed from the busy day and it seemed a bit like she was doing us a favor to serve us. We still enjoy eating here - as obviously a lot of others do too - but they won't get four or five stars from me without a friendlier atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to La Brioche several times.  Most of the time, it is great.  Sometimes when they are busy they overcook the bread and it's too hard.  I always love the soup and sandwiches.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and European chic.  The desserts...always poor and overpriced.  That's the only thing that stops me from giving them five stars.  I'm not talking about the bakery: those are all great.  But their tres leche, carrot cake, and other specialty items are bad.  Skip them."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Vastly overrated. Don't go there.  - Service is terrible. Be prepared to wait. Our waitress was nice, but both our drinks and our food, took a LONG time to get to our table. - Silverware (in a rollup, too) wasn't clean. We got a replacement fork from our apologetic waitress, but this is something I'd be okay with at IHOP or Denny's, not from a restaurant that bills itself as somewhat upscale. - Worst of all, both food and drinks are bland and not particularly tasty, and preparation leaves a lot to be desired. The croissant was at least two days old - hard and dry. The quiche (one of the specials) was undercooked. So were the crêpes. Salad had those nasty wilted leaves in abundance. Etc. - Other irritating details:   * No sweeteners at the table, only raw sugar packs   * Said sugar packs curiously jammed inside a way too small container   * Also undersized: comically tiny coffee spoons. Seriously. What the eff.  And then there's the whole \"no cell phones/laptops\" bit, which is apparently enforced according to other reviewers. This only applies inside though, we were sitting outside so they let us (?) play with our toys. I would have been an *extremely* unhappy camper if asked to put away my phone, inside or outside.  Here's the thing, La Brioche: before trying to be all quirky and stuff with your decor, silverware, and technophobic policies, how about you get the basics right?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like La Brioche.  Some friends rated it highly and so my husband and I took a chance.  Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience.  My husband and I had breakfast there today.  My husband had the \"green eggs\" special with pesto.  I had the \"old world porridge\" and a brioche.    My husband's dish was good, but not really worth the price (over $10).  It only came with one small piece of sourdough bread.  My porridge only filled half of a cereal bowl and arrived only warm instead of hot.  It was definitely not worth $8. The brioche tasted stale.  Our server never showed up again.  When I  tried to tell the management about the problems when we paid the check, they did noting and did not even apologize for the situation.  We will not go back again."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and each time I have left feeling a little disappointed.  I made a reservation for my most recent visit and although I knew that my friend was only 5 minutes away, the hostess refused to seat me.  It was fine though because I was able to have a cup of coffee while I waited for my friend to arrive.  The food is a little overpriced for what you receive and the place is a bit noisy.  I am not sure if I'd return again."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place for brunch. Great ambiance both indoors and outdoors. Food is high quality and always fresh. Brunch on Sunday usually offers a piano player inside. I also like how they strongly discourage cell phone use inside the restaurant. Food menu is limited from 2-4pm, but brunch menu is strong and is comparable to Graze."}
{"text":"At first I was a bit confused by their requests for no cell phones or laptops.  But after dining here three times, I get it.  It was nice to leave the office behind for a bit & relax.  I've stopped in for morning buns for take away & think they might be some of the best I've ever experienced (obviously, since I keep coming back for boxes full to take to work with me).  Wonderful service on 3 separate occasions while dining in.  Great patio, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am not quite sure what to think of La Brioche. Loads of nice furnitures, they have exquisite looking chairs and tables. Especially their chairs, they are huge with thick cushions and super comfortable. Reminds me of those over-sized couches you see in the posh hotels. Summer time brings outdoor seating, a quiet aisle of tables partially sheltered and away from the busy streets of University Avenue.   I was there on the eve of Christmas, my friend got one of their holiday bread loaves. Yes, it looks and tastes good but that thing was $11, which was even more than what we paid for our full breakfast meal. I liked the sauce on my Egg Benedict, but would have preferred if it wasn't on a buttery croissant which ended up making the entire dish overly rich. Sausage that we ordered as a side was great, but kind of salty to have it on its own, you need some toast or potatoes to go with them.  My dinner experiences were totally different. We were there to celebrate graduation. And had seafood linguine, mushroom pizza and another pizza with sausage and goat cheese which I don't remember the name. Loved the seafood linguine and the mushroom pizza. The linguine comes with generous serving of fresh seafood and the pizza is an olive oil based pizza with fresh mushrooms and the slightest hint of truffle fragrance. Once again the sausage never disappoints, but I am not a fan of goat cheese, and even a mild one could turn me off. That is purely personal preference, if goat cheese is for you, I would give that a shot.  So as you see I had the good and the not so good times. The reason behind my mixed feelings is that for the price and the food I don't feel like I *have* to be back for any of those. I can get all the above mentioned items elsewhere, either together or in separate restaurants, which are equally as good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast one morning on a whim. I ordered an omelet that came with some peppers and onions with potatoes on the side. The ingredients were not cooked and were still refrigerator cold. The omelet was barely warm. The coffee was bitter and over-extracted due to using far to little grounds for the brew. Probably the day before's batch. Service was an after-thought by someone wrapping flatware with napkins. I won't be back and couldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Our family has  been in the Madison area now for about two months.  This is one of our favorite spots for many reasons.  First, the quality of the food is wonderful and our family appreciates the concern for the origins of the food.  The source list is included on the menu!  Thank you.  Most, if not all of the food sources are local and healthy.  No frankenfood here!  Secondly, we have two small, well-behaved dogs who have been welcomed in the outdoor dining areas.   Lastly,  the waitstaff have been kind, courteous and more than attentive on each visit.  Favorites include the Greek Salad, Wild=Caught Salmon, Vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Lemon Poppyseed Muffin, Cesar Salad, Mushroom Soup. PS, we find the decor to be perfect for the fare, and quite cozy.  Can't wait till the snow flies and we gather for( a full) pot of tea and some hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and the morning buns are to die for. Yum!"}
{"text":"I occasionally come here to meet up with friends for coffee as the venue is aesthetically pleasing with a nice ambiance.  I've tried quite a few entrees of theirs (french toast, crepes, salmon omelet, breakfast sandwich, feta scramble) but it's nothing I couldn't prepare myself at home of the same quality if not better (pretty sure I could outdo them in the french toast and crepes department).  I probably won't give them another chance in terms of entrees (because why pay twice as much for something you could make yourself?) but I'll continue to go there for coffee and baked goods."}
{"text":"Visited this place for a friend's birthday. The bread in the bread basket was amazing. Especially the one with the nuts and seeds. And they did split the checks which was very nice and convenient.   It took a while to get the attention of staff to order. While we were told it may be slower than normal because they had an unexpected table of 20 - that table was done and gone before we even ordered. We did wait a long time for our food and the staff didn't come by to tell us the status of our food or apologize for the wait at any point.   When we finally got our food, I ordered my steak medium but it came without any pink at all. It was good but I'm sure it would have been better cooked to medium.  It seems this place is trying too hard to be fancy with the presentation and I just wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Unimpressive. I went here on a recent Sunday morning for brunch. The wait service was bad, bordering on insulting. My french toast was bland, which is surprising because it had vanilla and bananas on top. My husband's salmon omelet was almost inedible because it was so salty. With so many yummy brunch places in Madison don't waste your time, or money, here!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I've been there, last time my husband and I where there I was served what was essentially stale corn chips with tomato sauce and cheese for the bargain price of $12.  I've never really enjoyed their food (menu), it comes off as pretentious rather than truly good or refined.  Their baked goods on the other hand are very tasty - although I would recommend due to how crunchy the chocolate in my croissant was would be to slightly warm them. But the croissant itself was the best I've had in Madison.  So, I would recommend the bakery but not the restaurant. Be  aware that the place is packed on nice days and plan accordingly, parking can be a huge pain and wait times definitely vary.  Also, be aware they have a no screens policy, so be aware. I'm not sure if it's to avoid being a coffee house and encourage folks to move on in the guise of being slow eating friendly or what but it is not appropriate for any meeting or work requiring a screen (another reason why I am not often there)."}
{"text":"Visiting madison & was looking for a good place for brunch. This was definitely a good choice. Lovely sort of kitschy elegance - like the chairs & tables & assorted creamers & sugars. Good ambiance, delicious food - had a hard time deciding what to get. Service was good but food was slow to arrive today. Would definitely go back & would like to try a baked good next time."}
{"text":"I'm a slave to their Morning Buns and, in my opinion, deserve 5 stars just for having them. I also love their cookies. I have yet to try meals at their new location."}
{"text":"It's fantastic in every way. One of my absolute favorite places to go in Madison! You'll not be let down!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants, but they have recently suffered consistency problems. Today, for example, I ordered eggs Benedict that came with only one over done egg with very little ham and totally drenched in hollandaise. Plus, my greens were wilted. We waited almost a half hour to be seated and another at least half hour for our food to arrive after ordering, which is actually fairly quick for them. We used to think the wait was worth it, but no longer. We'll be going somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This time I had mushroom and picante ham in scramble eggs. Salad was served on the side. I really enjoyed the taste of salad dressing and my scramble eggs. It was just a perfect combination of the plate. My friend really liked the food and the atmosphere and wanted to come back here again. Our server was very nice, friendly and helpful.  She didn't rush us even we already finished the table and kept our conversation going there. Absolutely want to spend my brunch date here again soon."}
{"text":"The food is very good and it's a lovely setting. However, I had breakfast there alone and even though there were plenty of small tables available, I was seated at the least desirable table in the restaurant, directly under a cold AC blower, pushed up against a piano, with a table of four (loud) people a couple inches away. I ordered juice as well as eggs and a side of berries, but my waiter forgot the juice and was very hard to flag down. I'd go back but would insist on a better table, as I should have done."}
{"text":"The first time I came here everything was great the service the salad I ordered everything.. This last time I came for lunch it took us 30 min to get just a simple salad then when the salad arrived it was lacking dressing and the chicken was burnt and dry.. Then when it was time for the bill we had to flag down the waitress to get it, then after 10 min of waiting for her to take the bill we just went up front to pay."}
{"text":"Great place to eat any time of the day. It can get crowded early in the morning on weekends and around six at night. Overall the food is great. The salads are good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The pastas are made in house and are amazing. Same with the pizza dough. Some of the entreés lack a starch which would make them that much better. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and an inviting environment. I will be going back as soon as I get a chance."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are amazing. The food is fresh and local. Both times I have been here I have ordered the crepes. They are delicious.  The service is somewhat attentive. Be willing to wait. :)  The atmosphere is beautiful. The interior designer did a great job!"}
{"text":"Across the street from where I'm staying, so I find myself here often out of convenience.  Pros: Tasty, new spins on vaguely French-by-way-of-America foods. Ridiculously oversized bakery items in window. Morning buns are epic. Pleasant live piano music sometimes. Cozy eclectic decor.  Cons: Overpriced, you can find just as good baked items for less in this city, not to mention meals. They have a draconian policy on cell phones and tablets, which is understandable in what they're trying to achieve, but they're annoyingly strict - more than once, I walk away because I forget their policy and just want to read a book on my tablet. Comes off as condescending and technophobic."}
{"text":"We had our wedding cake catered by La Brioche and couldn't have been happier. The design was exactly what we had discussed, and they managed to perfectly match a tiny color sample I had given them. More than that, the flavor of the cake was amazing. We had lemon poppy seed with a lemon curd filling and vanilla buttercream. The lemon was just tart enough, and the buttercream was smooth, lightly flavored, and not overly sweet. The cake itself was perfectly moist; not soggy or gummy, but not dry. The staff were great to work with in the planning process, and they delivered an excellent product for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Went there at 7:15am after a night shift at the hospital to get pastries and coffee. The place had one table with patrons. The host/server greeted me after about a minute and became increasingly rude and uninterested as I ordered my pastries and drinks. What a great way to start the morning. Not only did that happened but they didn't even have plain croissants available yet. Hosts and waitresses should leave their attitude at the door!  The pretentious atmosphere and people make me rate this place poorly."}
{"text":"Second time at La Brioche for lunch. The menu is amazing, the food is average. The service was bad the first time. The server was downright rude the second trip.  Our table of 6 asked for a different server, but didn't get one till the meal was over. No water refills. No \"how's everything\". Basically ignored. $100 check and a slap in the face. Sorry, no third visit for us!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while and I wonder if it's changed ownership. The food is good but something is missing. The wait staff changed so that also made me wonder about ownership. Tonight it wasn't busy but it took a long time  to get our meal. My dinner should have been warmer than what it was. I had to ask for the bread basket but when it came there were no plates to put the bread on.  It will probably be a while before I go back.  05-27-17.  We revisited La Brioce this evening at about 5:30PM. We were seated quickly and the server came over with water and a bread basket, so no complaints. The menu noted that there is a new cook now and it told a little bit about her, which is fine. The menu has been pared down considerably. For me nothing stood out so I ordered the pork loin, she got the chicken dinner. It took forever to finally get our food, even though there were few people present. My pork was tasty but not much of a portion. There was a small salad greens topping but it had too much of a kick to it for my taste. I'm still hungry. Her dinner was almost too rich for her. I had some of hers. The dinners are pricey for what you get. I do not recommend La Brioche at this point."}
{"text":"I did try their breakfast with my mom and we both loved the food, ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"Fun retro atmosphere. Lots of energy (I liked the noise level but maybe not for people who like a quiet meal). And good food. We had an omelette, vegetarian eggs Benedict (on croissant), and crepes at our table and all were good. Loved my chai latte."}
{"text":"After biking right past the front door on the way to work for a half a year, too early for breakfast, my girlfriend and I finally took the time for Sunday brunch, and it was great. The French toast was fantastic, the wood paneled booths in back are relaxing (although not isolated enough from the racket up front), and the croissants really are worth the trip alone. I may have to bump back my start time at work to stop in on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"La Broach is a great calm casual restaurant with a older century decor! The service is good... Our server gave us many recommendations for plates to try! The food was overall ok! The bread they but as appetizer was really good but the past I had was on the heavy side drench in pesto cream also I tasted some time crunch in the pasta witch I found out it was a pepper seed but the pizza we had was really good and tasty... There Pastry are really good especially the Danish...  If i could I will give La broach a 3.5!"}
{"text":"I came back here for dinner. The bread in the bread basket was really good. I'm glad they're a bakery because I will want to buy more of it. The salad I had was nice & fresh but not that inspired. My pizza was just okay. My date had a chorizo burger and practically licked the plate. I ate most of his side of potato wedges. I'll come back, but probably more frequently for brunch."}
{"text":"I'm a bit embarrassed by how often I come here. We definitely have our favorite staff, and favorite menu items. Their bacon is some of the best I've ever had. Love the ambiance and their outdoor seating is my favorite in Madison. Perfect place to take out of town friends and family when you don't want to head all the way downtown."}
{"text":"One star is pretty harsh, but it was really /that/ bad.  Visited La Brioche over the fall for brunch with some friends, and the service was absolutely inept.  We waited for a good thirty minutes to be seated (at the time, the restaurant was no more than 50% occupied), and another twenty for menus.  Drinks were never filled, and we waited /another/ thirty for the check after we had finished eating.  But enough about the service... how about the food?  My omelette was overcooked, insipid in flavor and gummy in texture.  My dining partners ordered the pesto scramble (incredibly heavy handed on the salt), and the burger (nothing to write home about).  All in all, a dining experience I'd love to forget."}
{"text":"I dined at this restaurant with my peers for a lab meeting. The ambiance is nice and has that \"afternoon high tea\" feel.   The matcha latte was splendid and had just the right amount of frothed milk and sweetener.   Both the green eggs and ham, and salmon omelette were decent. It's nothing over the top but dishes I could easily make at home.   I'd come here to catch up with a few friends and to enjoy the atmosphere but I wouldn't say the food is worth it. It's overrated. Two eggs any style for nine dollars? That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was a bit leery going in after hearing things from friends.  I met a friend there for breakfast on a weekday.  There was a sign at the front saying to wait to be seated.  So we did.  Over 10 minutes.  No one greeted us except the man carrying out water for the plants out front.  A woman came over eventually to seat the group that walked in a head of us.  Didn't seat us.  People started coming in and walking past us to seat themselves.  We finally caught the eye of someone who told us to go ahead and find a table.  Yeah...maybe they should change the sign then?  Anyway, we chose a table that was for four since we wanted to be by the window.  Evidently, this was the wrong choice.  When our waitress came over, she asked if we were waiting for two more and when we replied not, she sighed and asked us to hand her the extra settings since we wouldn't be using them.  Note for the restaurant, if you don't want us to take a four-top, then either seat us like your sign says or tell us to help ourselves to a table for two.  Oh, we had also grabbed menus from the front so we could start deciding (since their online breakfast menu doesn't work).  According to one guy, they were fine, according to our waitress, we needed different ones.  When I asked for a tea that was listed online, I was told that was out-of-date.  At this point, I'm just praying the food is outstanding to make up for all of this plus the prices which are basically the same for all meals.  Our food did come out sooner rather than later (which I was also praying would happen since promptness had not been exhibited as yet).  I ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict.  Taste-wise it was great, although the eggs were not consistent.  One had a very runny yolk and the other a firm, just short of boiled-egg yolk.  I can handle both but I'd prefer it to be consistent.  Assembly-wise, I would have preferred it traditional open-face style rather than sandwich style.  It made it very difficult to eat.  I ended up just eating it ingredient by ingredient.  The salad was fine but a very odd side for breakfast.  Fruit would have been much better.  Our table was cleared in pretty good time but, after asking for our check, it took at least 10 minutes.  In which time our waitress brought out water and such to other tables but never dropped off the check.  My friend was planning on getting something from the bakery for later so got up to pick it out and pay so as not to waste more time.  When we were finally brought the check, we were told there was no reason to go up front and we needed to settle the bill with the waitress.  Yeah...  Overall, not impressed at all.  The decor (in front where we were) was fine.  But the wait time, and the unpleasantness of the staff, could have used improvement.  There are ways to make the same point without the attitude.  Saying, \"oh I see you got something from the bakery, I hope you like it.  When you're ready to pay for the meal, I can do that right here\" would have been much better.  Although, frankly after all the waiting, I was tempted to just go up and ask if we could just pay up there so we could get to work.  The feel of the place is no longer that of a bakery and my friend, who liked their baked goods and would often stop in at their old location, remarked that she wouldn't feel comfortable popping in here for treats even when it is on the way.  This is definitely going on my not-recommended-but-wouldn't-refuse-if-a-friend-insisted place.  But I would try to talk them into someplace else.   And I would make sure I'm in a good mood for the needed patience."}
{"text":"If I could sum up La Brioche in one word it would be: Overrated.   I've been to La Brioche more times than I've liked because I have an aunt in town who loves it and we go together often. Also, I used to work at the UWHC and would go to lunch with coworkers there sometimes.  I like that La Brioche is attractive. Their decorating style is cute and reminds me of an eccentric old lady's house. The hot pink wallpaper on the back wall is the bomb. I also like how the egg dishes come with mixed greens on the side instead of carbs.   Here is what I don't like about La Brioche:   -It's EXPENSIVE. Last time I was there a couple months ago, I took a new employee out for lunch. We both drank water and ordered a sandwich each. The sandwiches come with green salad on the side. My sandwich (a BLT) in particular, was tiny. It was more like the size of a half-sandwich from a place like Panera. The bill came to something like $30 dollars with tip. I thought this was ridiculous, and I didn't think the service, food, or atmosphere warranted that price.  -The eggs are bland. At least, the times that I've had omelets and such there, the dishes contained little flavor, and were in desperate need of some salt. I'm also pretty sure based on flavor (or lack thereof) that they use non-stick spray to cook eggs as opposed to using butter. This is a cardinal sin in my book. Butter is not to be feared, but embraced!  -The service is friendly, but SLOOOOW. The aforementioned lunch with my department's new employee took over an hour from the time we ordered to the time we got our bill. For two sandwiches. Nothing even had to be cooked! This is not good if they hope to appeal to people on limited-time lunch breaks.  -Finally, and this is picky, I'll admit, but it really rubs me the wrong way that they have signs up on the wall (and a note in the menu)  that prohibit the use of laptops and cell phones. I get that they want the place to retain an elegant vibe, but at the same time, it irks me, as a functional adult, to be told what I \"should\" do, especially in such a passive-aggressive manner. Also, La Brioche, if you're going to take over an hour to bring people their bill from lunch during a workday, they will probably have to check their email at some point to avoid getting fired, and thus being unemployed and unable to eat at your expensive restaurant.  Overall, I guess I'd give La Brioche 3 stars, but that's being extremely charitable. While  I've never had an appalling experience here, I've NEVER been wowed, and I've definitely been annoyed on several occasions.  The breakdown: Taste of food: 2.5 stars Location: 3 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 2 stars"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years and I love it. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The decor of the restaurant is lovely. Sometimes on the weekend they have live music.   Brunch Favorites: -Crepes -Banana Challah French Toast -Chilaquiles (must try with sour cream!)  The Berry Salad is really delicious. Can't go wrong there.  The pesto grilled cheese is really good. I recommend subbing the mixed green salad that it comes with for a cup of the tomato basil bisque for dipping.   They have nice dinner options available as well.   La brioche is an all around great spot! Love it!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere/decor, the service and the waitresses' aprons, but I can't say the same about the food.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict and the sum was not greater than the parts.  The dish desperately needed salting, the asparagus was uncooked and the \"croissant\" was dense and dry (not buttery or flaky).  Their french toast was nothing more than dry grilled challah bread topped with berries.  Bakery?  Good joke!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Tacos are to die for! The pastries are fresh and I definitely recommend buying some bread to take home.   Service was genuine and the atmosphere unique for Madison. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are very good, especially the mushroom one and the sausage with sage.  The salads are good, but I miss the one with pears in it. They have a new cook and menu, so some of the oldies/goodies are missing. I really miss the pot pie with brussel sprouts.  The back part of the restaurant also has too much light now--it used to have more ambience. The service was slow as usual."}
{"text":"Used reviewers comments to choose our entrées and for the most part we were not disappointed! Shared a morning bun (delicious!) and tried a matcha latte (not my cup of tea). Also got the Vanilla Challah French Toast and Pesto Scramble. I loved my pesto scramble, and would eat it everyday if I could. I think my boyfriend got a bit of a sugar overload with the French toast, but it was still good. Overall, we loved the outdoor seating and service and will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I came into La Brioche two days before my parent's 40th anniversary. I was able to chat with the pastry chef, show him a picture of the original wedding cake (from the 1970s) and discuss whether it would be possible to recreate it. He gave me a few options, let me e-mail him the picture, and then said it would get done. I picked it up two days later and not only did it look almost exactly like the original cake, everyone at the anniversary party raved about how delicious the cake was. We got chocolate cake with raspberry filing and a white buttercream frosting. I would highly recommend the cakes here if you need one for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Took my partners mom there for mothers day.   We ordered coffee,  Macha latte, glass of milk,  two morning buns, two croissant sandwiches,  and two eggs Benedict.   We substituted the side salad for a fruit bowl for a $3 up charge.   The total came to be about $85 with tip for four people.   The entire reason took her here was because we knew she'd like the ambiance and mismatched decor. So just expect to pay for that as well as the \"nitrate-free\" bacon.    The meals themselves were less memorable than the atmosphere.  The asparagus that came with the croissant sandwiches were limp and had no flavor.  The eggs benedict could have used more lemon Béarnaise sauce (fancy word for lemony hollandaise sauce). I actually liked the fact that it came on a croissant.   Our waitress was very flighty as we had to remind her multiple times of our beverages and morning bun as well as flag her down for the bill.   The morning buns were to sure for!  And if I come back here again,  it would be only for the morning buns and other bakery items.   For the price,  I can get a lot more breakfast for the money and more flavorful items elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal filled with a plethora of options and excitement. We tried a number of different dishes and nothing disappointed. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Brendan and Zalim are amazing cooks!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never left disappointed. I've actually really enjoyed it every time I've gone. Although the service does tend to be on the slow side the ambiance is sort of set up for that with the nice big chairs. I see it as a sit back and relax, sort of place. Not some place you'd want to come if you were in a big rush. I've only gone for lunch and dinner so I can't speak on the breakfast menu but I think their lunch/dinner menu is fantastic. I've really enjoyed all of the items I've ever ordered ranging from the fish to the salads. Next time I go I am definitely trying the pasta!"}
{"text":"I've been to La Brioche: True Food in the past and enjoyed brunch, though, like other reviewers seem to say, it is overpriced for what you get. I made a reservation for graduation to celebrate with my family, since graduation was on a Sunday morning, I knew I would be competing with the brunch crowd. When I made the reservation for 10, they took my name and told me that the manager would call to confirm. I was in there the next day for coffee anyway and still hadn't heard back about my reservation. I checked with the hostess and she went behind the counter and checked a book, came back and told me that my reservation was confirmed for 1:00 on Sunday. I show up with my out-of-town family in tow, and they had lost my reservation! And to top it off, the hostess was rude and dismissive. I was a loyal customer, but I won't be back! I don't have time for bitchy waitstaff and hostesses. I work in the restaurant industry and put my best face forward at work, these people should too. Management: Get your crap together!"}
{"text":"Great place, Busy during lunch, good people watching. Cheese sandwich is really good as well as salads. Service was nice even during the rush hour. Parking was not problem. Food presentation is fantastic."}
{"text":"Really good food. I appreciate that they go out of their way to buy local and organic foods. I'd recommend trying it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Food wise: I always come here for Sunday brunch and get their french toast either with berries or caramelized pecan/banana. It is very very tasty! They use brioche bread for the french toast and drizzle some vanilla cream on the top and finish it with your choice of organic berries or caramalized pecan and banana. I think I prefer the pecan/banana over organic berries. Def one of the best french toast in madtown. I also had omelet once but I was not impressed..   Price: def pricier than your other brunch places but still manageable.   Environment: good ambiance and the decor is pretty. there is outdoor seating which is nice for the summer and early fall."}
{"text":"Adding to other reviews: the food is really mediocre and the service is really poor. Given the number of reviews stating this, you would think the owners would have an interest in responding. But I guess there are enough west side ladies quite taken with the decor and cell phone policy to keep the place full despite ridiculous prices. I dont get it. Avoid. There are so many other places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places in Madison.  I especially love their breakfast/brunch menu as well as their lunch and dinner options.  I also love their fish specials on Friday night.  Coffee is good, but I especially love their white peach tea.  (Not to mention the unique tea pots they serve their warm water in to each table too.)  Pastries and cookies are wonderful.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  Plenty of outdoor seating for the warm months to enjoy.  Perfect place to go for a bite to eat and to escape reality for a while.  Did I mention it's a phone-free zone?!  :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fancy. Our party was definitely underdressed but they still respectfully served us anyway. Great prices. I felt like it should have been more expensive. I had the Ruben sandwich and it was the BEST I have ever had. I highly recommend this place. Huge pastries... and a nice day old basket with really cheap but still amazing stuff."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I ordered the ribs (the Saturday night special,), my boyfriend had the chicken pot pie, and we shared the cheese plate. The cheese plate was amazing: 5 different kinds of cheese (ex. cave aged goat cheese, sheep's milk blue), all from Wisconsin, and with yummy pecans and sour cherries. The ribs were terrific; nice and fatty, and with a tangy bbq sauce. Good garlic roasted potatoes too. My only complaint would be that the broccoli rabe was over seasoned and over cooked. My boyfriend was underwhelmed by his pot pie, but I think this is because he expected a proper crust. This pot pie only had the top puff pastry.   Our waitress was clueless. She had to be prompted to tell us about the cheeses on our cheese plate, didn't ask about condiments when she brought out our food, etc. To be fair, she might have been in high school, and she was perfectly nice. The waitress serving the surrounding tables seemed more clued-in though."}
{"text":"I have been going to La Brioche for many years. It is a wonderful place to grab brunch, lunch, a snack, dinner, or to order specialty desserts.   Some of the best things about La Brioche are: -There are lots of vegetarian options  -The water is free of fluoride (my mother is allergic to fluoride and it is nice for her to not have to bring her own when we go here) -There's an excellent selection of teas  -The kind request that La Brioche makes that customers are not using electronic devices improves the atmosphere and makes it a place to get away from our digital world  Some of the best things to eat (in my opinion) are: -Tomato Bisque -Shiitake Sake Soup -Grilled Cheese -French Toast -Lemon Crepes -Breakfast Tacos  -Veggie Sandwich  We have also ordered multiple cakes from La Brioche, which have all been outstanding.  I love La Brioche. The service is always great and it's an awesome place to stop for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.  Have just done a brunch here at this point, but I was so impressed and pleased. The space it beautiful -- the prettiest thing you've ever seen in a strip mall. Lush without being stuffy.  The food is unpretentious and perfectly done. My chilaquilles were creamy and spicy. Such a lovely option for breakfast in the Midwest. The garlic roasted potatoes on the side were crispy and flavorful. The red velvet cupcake for desert was moist and substantial.  I was, frankly, quite shocked by how inexpensive the whole thing was. Most brunch dishes are $7-9, and come with a side of greens and bread.  The service was just a tad overwhelmed, but it was 11:30am on a Sunday.  I'm looking forward to a dinner here!"}
{"text":"Wow, as a regular patron of IHOP on University Ave, I'd blown by this place like a billion times, but I only went there for the first time recently. Don't let its being in a strip mall lower expectations. For someone like me who prefers eating all organic and grass-fed stuff, etc., etc., this is also perfect, and they even do something special with the standard water they serve. I had a tomato soup of some sort, I think, and I think organic chicken. My friend had a personal-sized pizza, and she ate almost all of it, so it must've been good.  There is some funky new age stuff like feng shui in the restaurant, but it doesn't really hamper the experience at all for those who don't believe in it. Good place! Will definitely go back to try some of the pastries."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place for their amazing bakery and breakfast/lunch options. But the last time I went, I decided I would NOT be going back. After we were seated in the barely occupied dining area, we sat for 10 to 15 minutes waiting for our server as the staff stared at us from across the counter. The server never came, and the staff continued to stare. We felt so unwelcome. They didn't even bring us water while we waited. I made eye contact several times with the multiple servers behind the counter, but no one came to wait on us!! I saw other people getting waited on. People who sat down after us got a server. It was incredibly rude. We had all the time in the world to go over the menu too, which lists fluoride as a toxin, by the way, and also requires you not to use your cellphones or computers, so don't plan on coming for a latte while you work on your tablet.   We went down the road to the Cafe Hollander instead, which ended up being the more tasty choice anyway!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing atmosphere! The food is fantastic, the servers are great and the location is surprisingly very conducive to relaxed conversation and an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Consistently great food which is locally sourced. Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff.They are also a bakery and have excellent breads, muffins, scones, cookies, cakes and desserts. We went for lunch and had 3 different sandwiches which we shared . All 3 came with a nice side salad and dill pickle spear.We tried the spicy turkey, sliced ham with apple butter(it also had fresh sliced apples on it) and the BLT. All were excellent. We shared a chocolate eclair for dessert-they are huge. We have been here for lunch, dinner and brunch and always had an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Tried it twice and did not enjoy my experience either time. Food is ok & was served cold, undercooked eggs."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch, which seemed to be an inconvenience to the waitstaff. I ordered tomato quiche and got some type of quiche that had no tomatoes in it! Mom & sister split a Reuben with the toughest corned beef ever. Plus charged us $2.50 for splitting it, which the waitress never mentioned. Waitress never came back to check on us. We made the mistake of ordering a strawberry cream puff, which in a restaurant featuring a bakery you would think would be fresh, but it wasn't. We had to use a steak knife to cut it, and it had obviously been in the fridge too long! Couldn't flag down our waitress when we wanted to leave. Bad, bad, bad. We used to love this place, but sorry we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I stopped in for two croissants this morning on the way to work.  I asked for a chocolate and a plain croissant to go. The initial bite was disappointing and it kept getting worse from there.  It was hard and dense.  There wasn't the taste of butter that I'm used to but an oil like substance oozed from each bite that was rather unpleasant.    The croissants were $2 each.  I'm never coming here again. There should be a warning of: EXTRA-HEAVY croissant coming your way.  Gross."}
{"text":"The masterminds behind La Brioche really thought of every detail. From the cute water pitcher handkerchiefs to their quirky no-cell phones rule, La Brioche strives to provide their customers with a charming, thoughtful, and detail-oriented experience.   The veranda-style seating to the side of the restaurant has marble slab table tops and is sandwiched next to a bike trail and trickling water fountain - let me know if you find something more zen than that in a shopping plaza.  The oven-fired pizzas, roughly 11-inches and made to order, came out faster than expected and the organic wheat crust was tasty and chewy. I didn't even notice I was being healthy that day.    Their reverse-osmosis filtered water which they use both in cooking and serving is seriously delicious. Who would have thought that the metallic tasting tap water in other restaurants could be the real culprit behind a less-than pleasant meal experience? I'd come here just for the water. Another glass please."}
{"text":"When I first got to Madison, I was a fan of the Ovens of Brittany on University Avenue. I was disappointed when it seemed like the last breakfast place on the near west side had disappeared. Then La Brioche opened up. It became the go-to breakfast place for our family, but due to the noise from the kitchen and dining area, plus other problems, we found ourselves going in less and less until we stopped altogether.  Today, I thought I would give them a try again, since they get so many things right. While the noise issue is still there, I would say that you could sit in the back dining area or the recently installed outdoor tables that are on one side of the restaurant. I am also happy to report that the drip coffee that they were serving has changed to True Roasters coffee out of Fitchburg. La Brioche has the same great breakfast menu and several bakery selections that could feed two people at a time. The service is a little slow and unless you are picking up bakery to-go, I won't try to be out of here in 30 minutes or less.  I look forward to trying them again for lunch and dinner, as well as breakfast."}
{"text":"This review has been sitting as a draft since last summer (2016). Perhaps things have changed since then.  Pathetic Pesto Fettuccine Primavera. Surprisingly tasteless. No garlic, no parm, no flavor. And for a restaurant that prides itself on local sources, where are the seasonal (mid-August) summer veggies? I found carrots in three colors - pretty but no sweetness or freshness, faded and bland from last fall's root cellar? Peas, usually harvested and wax beans so colorless, they got lost in the sauce. Garnished with four tiny cherry tomato halves spaced around the rim of the bowl. No broccoli, no zucchini or summer squash, no red or green bell peppers, no red onion. It could have been so much more colorful and flavorful.   The \"ice water\" was really warm so I ordered a glass of the House white wine. I don't know when it actually arrived. Our party of six was seated at three small tables pushed together. Rather than serving each customer, our server reached across the table to hand us our dishes. So it was the same with my wine, placed on my neighbor's table to my right when I was looking the other direction. I was about to ask the server when I noticed it. I commented to my neighbor, I didn't see it there. She replied that it had been there for a while.  Last item to note is the decor - very dark and heavy. Kind of oppressive in the summertime."}
{"text":"Charming ambiance. Good food. Horrible service. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or something but we hardly ever saw our server. It took ten minutes and two reminders for the server to bring my mother milk for her tea. Same thing for the red pepper flakes for my pizza. The marguerita pizza was delicious, but the tomato bisque was amazing!!! My mom mentioned that it was my birthday so the server gave me my chocolate croissant for free. It was very basic. The server was really nice though. She probably was having a rough day or something."}
{"text":"Typically I'd say this place is 5 stars but not this time. Ate here for brunch and I understood it would be busy but when I see 6 tables open and hear the servers telling the hostess to sit more people but am still told it's a 40 min wait... I got a bit confused. Server was good not great as was the food. The strawberries were sub par. I always get a mocha and it was great like it always is. I will be back and hopefully it will be back to the usual 5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't go to LaBrioche-True Food very often, and after a meal there yesterday, I remember why. When LaBrioche was a small bakery with a little bit of seating on S. Midvale Blvd, it was a delightfully warm and steamy place to have a cup of coffee and something sweet. The owners were more often than not behind the counter with a friendly hello and how-are-you. Since the move to University Avenue and expansion to a full-service restaurant, sadly, much of that homey ambiance is gone.  The organic and locally-sourced food is great, if pricey (how about some gluten-free options?), the attention to details of decor is welcome, the bakery looks as delectable as ever, and I for one appreciate the no cell-phone policy. I'd give at least a 4-star rating on those things alone, but...  All of this is completely spoiled by the most poorly-trained and unwelcoming waitstaff I have ever encountered in a restaurant - bar none. Above all, to a person they seem dreadfully unhappy and overworked. Service is slow and once the food arrives, there's no return visit to inquire about the meal or other needs - until it's time for delivery of the check. The blame for this rests squarely on the owners and leadership of the place, who ought to fix it. Until this aspect of the experience is improved, 2 stars is all from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at La Brioche at least a dozen times.  The food is nearly always excellent, but the service is uneven.  We went in for Sunday brunch and found the restaurant maybe half-full.  We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!   BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!"}
{"text":"We went there many times and still have something new to explore. I love the bear claw, big puff, burger , fresh dip and so on. Very good place to spend time with friends and family."}
{"text":"Can you guys get someone to bring the vegetarian eggs benedict to my house? That croissant/delicious egg combo was AWESOME. I also want to marry the pink wallpaper so bring some of that along, too.  Three stars because that \"chi\" stuff is total elitist bullshit and comes off as just plain silly considering the place is in a Midwestern strip mall. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"After a friend chose La Brioche as a brunch spot, I mistakenly took a peek at some of the Yelp reviews. Yikes.  I was a little terrified to go.  From the reviews, I anticipated some old lady decor, overpriced food, bad service, and no cell phones.   For the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. Call me Maude or Ethel or Dorothy June...but I kind of like the decor.  It's different, but not over the top. I love the big comfy chairs, the pillows, the slightly crazy wallpaper. However, things like the open kitchen/bakery counter and the tile floor keep it from being too stuffy.  It was fancy, yet casual...if there was such a thing! I only wish that on the cold day we went that they had double doors - it was pretty darn cold in the restaurant.  Our server was young, friendly, and did a great job answering our questions and helping accommodate my request for some plain yogurt for my 16 month old.  She wore a cute apron as part of her uniform and seemed to be enjoying her job, which is always important to me when I am \"rating\" service people. The menu was very detailed...maybe a little too detailed.  In case you don't know...they serve organic eggs.  And, in case you forget, they remind you on every single menu item. It's a little overkill. A simple \"we use all organic eggs!\" at the bottom of the menu would suffice.    I was expecting to be royally annoyed by the whole no cell phone thing.  I'm always that obnoxious person taking photos of their food.  I still did...I was just a little sneaky about it. I guess I am the person they are trying to reign in! I did notice a few other sneaky folks with their phones out, but luckily nobody ordered us out of the restaurant or anything like that. I understand their desire to create a technology free zone even if its not really my thing.  The details with the food were all excellent.  My friend ordered tea, and it came in a gorgeous green tea pot.  I ordered the Vanilla Challah French Toast with berries.  It was was beautiful.  The berries were fresh, and the first piece I ate was delicious. At this point, I would have given La Brioche a solid four star rating. However, my second piece of French Toast was completely undercooked. Like, it was soft and wet and mushy and icky and made me think to myself, \"Self, should you really even be eating this?  There could be some serious food poisoning in your future!!!\"  Luckily, I survived, but I cannot shake how bad that single piece of French toast was.  My sad soggy toast kind of ruined the rest of the meal for me.   I would really like to go back to La Brioche.  The baked goods and pastries looked amazing and there were other items on the menu that I would like to try. Hopefully they will be better than my first meal. I am hoping to bump them up another star...but until then...it's a three. The number one goal of a restaurant is not to have interesting decor or good servers or to create a certain type of environment. It is to make GOOD food.  Good, well-cooked food.  They need to work on that."}
{"text":"La Brioche is one of my all-time favorite Madison restaurants! I haven't been since their last menu change but I will be going back soon! The ambience is wonderful. Right when you walk in, it feels as if you've left Madison."}
{"text":"Not a lot was open on Labor Day, so some friends suggested we go here. I reluctantly said yes, since I don't much care for this place. I thought that this would be a good opportunity to give this place another chance, but was again disappointed.  Well, it still is overpriced. The service was fine and then terrible. My food (a breakfast platter with eggs, potatoes, bacon, a side salad and a chunk of bread) was all very mediocre. The worst was the bacon, which was so overcooked and crispy that it was inedible. The eggs weren't cooked as I requested. And the potatoes were under seasoned and unevenly cooked.   Now, if this was diner food for $5, I wouldn't be complaining. But, this was a $12 plate of easy-to-cook food! It should have been way better. At least the coffee was good, and a bite of my friend's bear-claw was nice.  I appreciate the organic items. But, if they aren't prepared properly, then forking over twice as much for my breakfast simply doesn't make sense.  Simply not worth your money or your time."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch. Had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get seated but I didn't think it was too bad. I got the the French toast and I think it was probably the best I've had so far. In my experience, French toast can often be slightly hard to cut into but this was just perfect! No tables were shaken!  The restaurant itself is pretty cute. I enjoyed the style. There's different types of seating - booths, tables with regular chairs, and tables with fancy chairs. We got seated on the regular chairs. We deduced that the fancy chairs are for fancier, classier, older ladies who need to be impressed. They probably figure that we 20-somethings will be charmed regardless of the fanciness of the chair. They're right. I'll be back. Maybe as a fancier version of myself."}
{"text":"This was a great find! I found this through reviews and decided to give it a try after looking through their menu. The setting was classy-eclectic with all different chairs and tables set together. My mom got tea that came in an adorable teapot; I got an espresso that came in vintage china - so fun! The food was also incredible; I did a combo of half of the veggie sandwich and the berry salad. I would get both again in a heartbeat! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"ENJOYABLE LUNCH SPOT  The four of us had a very nice lunch here. I had the Caprese Sandwich and my wife had the Mushroom soup. Both were very good. It was a beautiful day in September and we ate outside.  All in all, a very pleasant outing."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that comes off as trying to be \"hip\" by catering to liberal college students that like to pretend they're sophisticated and cultured. I had a very hard time even ordering my food, as I was too busy laughing at the descriptions of the menu items, almost all of which contained at least one ingredient being \"organic,\" \"free-range,\" \"free-trade,\" or some other attractive buzzword.  The food itself was fine. I ordered breakfast tacos which were pretty average. I may just not be aware of how corn tortillas work, but it all was very dry. Just about everything on the menu is 10 bucks or more, and you'll be paying for the presentation rather than the quantity. Coffee was okay - nothing special.  We generally got good service - my water glass was always full and so was my coffee mug, and we didn't have to wait long to be served. Outdoor seating was nice on a beautiful morning.  All-in-all, if you get into this sort of place, you'll probably enjoy it. If you don't, you can definitely find a better, less expensive place."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with a friend and had a great time! I was a little worried showing up on a Sunday at 10:30 AM, but surprisingly, we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. During that time, I was pleased to see that there was free coffee while I waited. I also enjoyed the pianist who was playing that morning.   Following the short wait, we were seated at a really cute table. I ordered a macchiato and the Vanilla Challah French Toast (came with carmelized pecans, bananas, and creme anglaise), which was delicious! I found the service just as good as the food. In sum, I definitely plan to return in the near future, particularly since there is a huge parking lot (and I hate dealing with the Madison parking situation)."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast spot in Madison.   Why?, the coffee and coffee service is unusually great compared to other restaurants, The background music is so nice and not the usual loud Muzak bang bang crap, the staff has always been helpful with inquiries, these folks are not a bunch of clueless first job teens they are mature and smart.   I also love lunch and dinner here.  One quirky issue I have with any restaurant like La Brioche is the overkill of needless information on the menus.  I mean these folks are trying like crazy to get into the whole green, open-range-free roaming, nicely treated food resources kick.  Of course every food selection is also organic or some such marketing moniker.  So they think they are California foodies somehow transplanted into the midwest.  Fine, though food procurement and processing will change with the times and new knowledge, I don't think that restaurants like La Brioche have to dive way into each food fad de jure.  But that's me, sorry, I look at all the extra menu information as California style marketing here in the midwest.  It's almost as if in the near future we will have more stories on the menu like: ' no green vegetables were mis-treated in preparation of your order.'  End rant. thank you.    So, the only off experience I've had here is that once the salmon seemed to be kind of flat.   Other than that the fresh bread and butter plus soups before the main entrees are just wonderful.  Almost every entree seems to include fresh and healthy greens, I could live in this place. Remember for those left at home a FULL bakery selection is waiting near the front counter for your home bound pleasures.  Wow, if carbs were currency we could all be millionaires when checking out.  So the restaurant presentation is excellent, prices are good to medium for this kind of service and product in Madison, Wi.  and somehow restaurants can't seem to deliver great coffee but La Brioche seems to, makes breakfast here above the rest.   A lovely breakfast experience and other feeds during the day."}
{"text":"The menu never changes.  Been going there for years.  Some of what they have like the challa French toast is hard to beat.  Other things like the eggs with mushrooms and pancetta are remarkably flavorless.  The outside seating and wing chairs make for a very nice experience.  Good thing because the service can be slow despite a large staff, and then there's the menu. Lots of competition these days- they need to shake things up a bit."}
{"text":"New dinner menu is amazing. Easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Extremely interesting/unique food that tastes fantastic."}
{"text":"I went for Restaurant Week about ten days ago. I tried the corn & cheddar fritters, the olive oil poached halibut and the lemon yogurt cake.   The yogurt cake was my favorite of the three, it felt very unique. The basil ice cream flavor is a little odd on its own, but it combined remarkably well with the berries and the cake. Which is precisely what I felt was lacking in the other two courses.  The fritters and the halibut were really good, even delicious, but I felt like each had something missing to complement the dominant flavors, so by the end of each course I felt a little tired of them. But overall it was very good.  I'll definitely give it another shot, there is a lot to like, and the atmosphere is quite nice."}
{"text":"Visited La Brioche on 6/07/2017. Our son and his wife picked the location to meet up with us and celebrate our 33 anniversary. Upon arriving, I was surprised by the location which was quaint, but busy. All outdoor seating was taken and the customer traffic was brisk. Entering the store you're welcomed by a cozy setting of bakery in a glass display that makes you hungry the moment you walk in. The décor is a slight antique style, slightly dimmed lighting and the aroma of the foods being eaten and prepared among the hustle and bustle of patrons and staff; yes the place was busy! We asked to be seated while waiting for the other half of our party to arrive. We were seated in a comfy seat in a booth and shorty the others arrived. We were quickly served by waitress with water and asked about drink choices. We chose different types of coffee which was delivered in a acceptable time and asked about our food order. We asked to be given a bit more time. Shortly after the waitress arrived again and we were ready with our orders.  Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time: was fresh and hot and appeasing to the eye and nose.  The food was deliciously prepared and the portions were plentiful. I definitely  recommend La Brioche on your next visit to Madison or in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that the quality of La Brioche has improved since my last visit. I tried La Brioche for dinner (previously, I had only been for brunch) and was pleasantly surprised. During dinner, La Brioche serves a modest wine list, with a rotating list of entrees and small plates. The bread they served was excellent, especially their seeded multigrain bread.    For an appetizer, I had the cherry walnut salad, which was served with a tangy vinaigrette and delicious local cherries. For my main course, I had the Chicken \"Not\" Pie, which was basically a deconstructed chicken pot pie. The bone-in chicken breast was tender and juicy, and the veggies and puff pastry were cooked perfectly.  As a side, I ordered the seasonal vegetables, which were also pretty good (though slightly undercooked) and served with a curry sauce. Don't miss their desserts. I had the chocolate decadence cake with espresso and wasn't disappointed. Overall, would recommend."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place so I finally decided to give it a try! Right when you walk into the place it has the cutest ambiance and decor. It really takes you to a different place which has a nice feel to it. But unfortunately, I would have to say the service was mediocre. As we walked up to the hostess we weren't sure if it was a seat yourself kind of place or wait to be seated because the hostess just stared at us. As first timers, that was very awkward.   We got seated and our server was quite friendly. We told her that this is our first time and asked for recommendations. She kindly gave a suggestion for each section. Right when the food came out I would have to say that was the last time we saw her before getting our checks. She didn't check up on us to see how how our food was or anything. Didn't even ask if we needed anything else. Mind you it wasn't very busy being a Wednesday around 5pm. The hostess did do well on refilling our waters and being attentive on that.  But needless to say, the food was AMAZING! Presentation was as good as it tasted. Highly recommend the pesto pasta! I will definitely come back to this place because the food was awesome and I would love to try everything else on the menu. Hopefully the service will be better in the future."}
{"text":"Hostess answers the phone sweetly.  I ask about making a reservation for 12 for a lovely business breakfast celebration on a weekday.  She, in no uncertain terms, let me know that reservations would not be accepted. Really? Wow! For 12 trying to have a nice business breakfast together.  Way to let money and good reviews slip out the door!  I'll move on down the road now."}
{"text":"The service is very slow. The atmosphere outside is peaceful with the fountain. The food is decent for the price."}
{"text":"It was a good brunch place, awesome interior, clean. They have attentive staff. Never got to sit outside, but it seems cool."}
{"text":"A very mixed bag.  The service is atrocious: waitstaff ignore you and are incredibly slow.  Not infrequently, ordered items never appear and the staff have (unbelievably) become visibly annoyed when this is pointed out.  That being said, the food is often quite good.  I say \"often\" as the quality can vary wildly.  E.g., sometimes the shiitake mushroom soup is superb, other times it is fit to be poured down a sink.  Yes, you can send it back (and we do) but consistency should be taken for granted in a good restaurant.  We've lived in Madison for 3 years now and find most of the restaurants sorely lacking.  However, the few that aspire to be better than the rest are, by the standards of most major cities, quite mediocre.  When La Brioche is good, it is a nice dining experience.  On the other hand, if you're there on an \"off\" day, it is simply bad.    I think it's worth remembering this is Madison, WI, not NYC or Chicago.  In a major city, La Brioche would go out of business without question.  In Madison, I'm grateful for the few restaurants that even try to be better than average.  So, if you're willing to take a chance, you might do better here than at most places in town.  And the bakery items are generally quite nice, so at least you'll have a good dessert.  For reference's sake, I've eaten here perhaps two dozen times since it's opened, including breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner, both socially and professionally."}
{"text":"In terms of the bakery:  Cinnamon roll = absolutely delicious and perfect for 2 people to split.  Chocolate croissant = pretty darn good.  Eclair = amazing, though big enough for 4 people to split and still be happy, as it is so rich.   In terms of the meals:  Great soups and salads, perfect grilled cheese sandwiches, and wonderful quiches. The tomato bisque was quite yummy!"}
{"text":"Yes- I have experienced better - much better. I will say: do not go here for the baked goods. The wonderfully hot bread purchased on a frosty morning had zero taste, or rather it had the awful bland taste of the worst Copps Italian white bread. They obviously buy their dough from somewhere else- there was not a speck of yeasty goodness coming out of the steam. This was the first time in my life that I left a crust of fresh bread on my plate and threw it out. The croissants were also totally commercial boring with not a hint of buttery French yumm to them. The chocolate in the chocolate croissant was not good chocolate. They do not even try to call it a 'pain chocolat', thank goodness, as it is SO far from the real thing.  The cafe is, as other reviews have noted, cutesy and decorated in an antiquey shabby chic style. The lunches I have had were pretty good with moderately good service and pricey for what you get. We also had to wait for service and the food seemed to take a long time to come out. I have never been for dinner but most likely will not try  it."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch. I ordered egg benedict croissant + a side of potato. It came with baby green salad; I liked how they only lightly, very gently, mix the salad with some olive oil. The interior was nice.  The ingredients were fresh as reflected by the simplicity of the seasoning. The potato was sauteed with oil, basil, garlic and pepper, but yet it was incredibly good. You could tell that it wasn't from batch processing. The cream sauce for the egg benedict had a tint of vinegar yet it retained its creaminess without being burdened with numbing thickness.  The eggs were pouched just right with the yolk being liquidy. (This takes a big tank of boiling water & attention to achieve the shape and texture.) Needless to say, croissant was good as they are also known for their bakery.  They had slow jazz (flute & piano that day) playing in the background. The sound system was not bad (way too many venues blast their imbalanced sound system too loud). I could still hold a conversation despite sitting right next to the piano.  However, service was mediocre, or bad I'd say. They were good with placing orders, but it took me 20min to get someone to get me some hot water. The girl I eventually managed to wave over was a hostess and she looked at me weird as if she has nothing to do with her customers.  She came back 10min later and asked if anyone had fetched me water, and I said no. She then got me the water herself."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last Friday for fish, went against my instinct and ordered a pasta dish instead.  It was horrible, tasted like liquid smoke, purely inedible.  I sent it back and it was remade, still I couldn't eat it, again like liquid smoke.  It was supposed to be a shrimp and mushroom pasta, I have no idea where this flavor came from. I have never sent a dish back.  The server told me it was from the sesame oil.  I ordered another entree and it was mediocre.  I definitely will not be going back for anything other than their fish.  Brunch is ok but service is always slow.  The 2 stars are for the server who handled it well and was pleasant."}
{"text":"We ordered tea/coffee at first. I do enjoy the way la Brioche serves the tea, in a china teapot rather than a paper cup. Wish the teapot also came with china tea cup but maybe one day.   We then ordered the Bruschetta, it was amazingly flavorful, just loved it. The whole experience from the food to service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and it really is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison so 5 stars is what it gets.  I won't object to calling the place pretentious, but it's exactly the right amount of pretentious for me. Love the decor, love the feel, love the no cell phones rule.  Only really been there for brunch and lunch, but the food is always delicious. Most dishes come with a plain green salad with what I assume is old and balsamic vinegar dressing. Any dish it comes with, breakfast or lunch, it's always a good accompaniment.  In the past, I've really enjoyed:  Chilaquillas (now breakfast tacos, I think) French toast (berries or bananas/pecans) Eggs benedict (on a croissant!)  Burger (mark of a really good burger: I don't wish I'd added BBQ sauce to it)  Just added to the list: spicy turkey. Avocado, aioli, and a perfect amount of spice for a sandwich (well, for me).   Always want to eat the pastries, usually too full. They're always good (and I've got a creme puff with strawberries waiting for me in the fridge), but the reason I love La Brioche is the good food.  Sad to say I have had service that wasn't the best (just in terms of slowness/not getting water refilled), but I love everything else about the place enough that I can't bring myself to dock it that last star. I must have gone 8+ times now, and haven't had service as bad as mentioned in the other reviews...but I have definitely mentioned it as a drawback myself.  But so as not to end this review on a downer:  Cream puffs, cream puffs Here I come Cream puffs, cream puffs, Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaraunt that has organic, well-treated-while-living meat, and local produce, go no further. This is one of the best spots in Madison in terms of affordability and locally-produced goodness. The meals I like are well-prepared and tasty.  With that said let's get inti what isn't so hot about Ka Brioche and why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4.  First of all the service can be hit or miss. Ther are one or two servers that are really good, but most of the oters are lacking some of the fundamental skills.  The variety of options on the menu also seem pretty small. Yes, they have tons of soup to chose from, but the entree selection is small.  The deserts are also not as good as I want them to be for business that got it's start as a bakery and does beautiful wedding cakes. They are often dry, slightly stale, and not as flavorful as they should be. But my partner swears by the macaroon, but this is the only thing he gets when we have desert.   The decor isn't all it's cracked up to be. They did an excellent job for being in a strip mall, but they're idea of different zones kind of failed. Supposedly the zone in front is more for conversation-seekers and the area in back is for quiet-seekers. This falls completely apart when, on Friday nights they have a piano player up front. He is so loud that you can't think let alone talk, so everyone ends up going in the back to get away from it.  Overall good food, but they need to work on some of the rough edges when it comes to the non-food categories."}
{"text":"La Brioche is odd. It is gorgeously adorned on the inside, the tables, chairs, waiting area, bakery case, even the wallpaper tells me the staff want a more high-end feel for the place, and I think they achieve that for the most part. Being that it's in a very blah strip mall and has no appeal from the outside, walking in feels like you are being transported to a cozy restaurant with a full garden out front, not a busy, ugly parking lot with a Dairy Queen next door.  They even have a luxurious drape hanging over the doorway that you have to pull apart before walking in, what a great way to complete the transition from outside.   If the food would have been excellent it would be a four star restaurant that just happens to be in a strip mall, but the menu was misleading.  I ordered a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato bisque soup. What I got was more like a veggie sandwich on warm bread. It wasn't bad but it wasn't a grilled cheese sandwich. There was more veggie, avocado, and spinach than cheese, and the bread wasn't toasted, or crispy, or grilled. It was \"warmed\" is the best way I can describe it.   I could have gotten a better sandwich and soup from Panera for a much better price."}
{"text":"First off, for being in a strip mall this place is gorgeous. The landscapers clearly take some pride in their work, and on a nice day I'm sure grabbing lunch on their side patio is great. The inside is a little on the dark side, but we got seated towards the back where we could see the cake decorating room next to the bakery, which was pretty neat.    I had their banana pecan french toast and a raspberry french soda, both were good and the servings were pretty generous. With tip this place runs about $15 bucks a plate. It took maybe 20-25 minutes to get our food on a busy Sunday morning.   The waitstaff did leave a little to be desired, however. The hostess sat us at a table with only one chair and left- my boyfriend had to awkwardly walk across the room in search of a chair to steal. Our waitress came for orders and to bring us our food, and never refilled drinks.   Overall, though, a decent experience. The food was tasty and at a reasonable price; I think I'd give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the number of 3 star and lower reviews...I have been here about four times (once for breakfast, once for lunch and twice for dinner).  Every time, my wife and I (and whoever accompanied us) have had great service and good food.  The place always seems crowded and noisy--not that is a bad thing.    Sometime I'd like to go back for their pizza on Wednesday nights, which a lot of people have raved about.    The decor is interesting--it's nice not to have vinyl everywhere.   The burgers are great, by the way!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! Fancier atmosphere. Yummy cheese danish, too."}
{"text":"Well well well.  How soon good things must come to an end.  Or at least in this case be less good.  I went here on Valentines Day, and while I kind of expected it to be a little hectic, we never had a \"waiter\" and the staff \"forgot\" about us.  We did sit in the \"slow chi\" area, but it was a little ridiculous.  Evidently people had called in sick, and even the owner was waiting tables.  I don't fault the staff for this, but I do think it was kind of crappy that the owner walked by my table several times and HAD to notice the empty plates.  He was the one that brought them to us after all.  Anyway, all I am saying here is, the food is still good, but maybe they should rethink their whole dining room \"chi\" crap.  Fast, slow, whatever.  People still expect some timely service."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for about 5 months and finally went in today and placed a carry out lunch order.  I got an entree sized greek salad with no olives and no onions and a pastrami sandwich for my husband.  My salad was good, but olives came in it.....however, the portion size was very small for $12.  I would expect almost twice as much and I am not a big eater.  My husband said his sandwich was pretty good.  I will go back and give it another shot but doubt I will eat there- the decor and environment seemed more suited to an older crowd and it was very busy!!"}
{"text":"Great soup selection and specials.  My new favorite spot when I return to Madison."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I took my mom here since she really enjoys the crepes. I had neither been here before nor had I heard of it, but was fine giving it a whirl for my mother.  The only thing I can REALLY remember is that the table was awfully sticky and my server made way more eye contact than was comfortable.  We walked in and I could tell the ambiance they were going for and noticed the \"no cell phone\" sign. I have to agree with other guests about this policy, on the weekends it's fine, but if it were a weekday I don't think it is reasonable to enforce because of work obligations. I could see asking people to silence their ringer, but a lot of people that go out to lunch during the workday need to have an idea of what's going on when they get back into the office.  The only thing I could think of was that they wanted to turn over tables faster and according to a recent study people on their phones generally take longer to complete a meal.  Anyway, I was a little disappointed they only had their brunch menu available since I really wanted to order a specific salad from the lunch menu I saw online, but alas, I ordered the House Cured Wild-Caught Salmon Omelet off the brunch menu and it tasted like a brick of cream cheese.  It was okay, but the pile of greens with a berry vinegarette didn't really complement the salmon omelet. Also, the salmon omelette had WAY WAY too much cream cheese. I had to open the omelet up to dig some of it out and It almost seemed the extra cream cheese was to cover up the fact that there was a very small amount of salmon in it. I felt ripped off.  My mom's crepes were good, my fiancé's food was forgettable (I can't even remember what he had!) and the service was nice, but to be honest, it was awkward, at least for me.  I am not someone who makes a lot of eye contact, so this may be a personal thing, but I was uncomfortable with how much eye contact she would make when she would ask if I wanted more water.   I mean...just read your customers a bit better...I felt like she was staring at me a lot and I'd glance up and it was a hard stare.  Overall, I would take my mom here again if she wanted to go, but I wouldn't choose it on my own or recommend it to a group of friends."}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger with a side salad.  Like always,I love places that provide a salad rather than a potato.  I like their mantra of true food.  The food was great, flavorful but simple.  That is where my praise ends.  The restaurant is in a strip mall and parking is difficult to find.  The location is in a very busy area and if you are not familiar with street, you will pass it (at least once).  My GPS showed it was next to IHOP.  Read: IT IS ACROSS FROM IHOP.  Do not make my mistake.  The sign is not large, neither is the address.    Honestly, it is just too pricey without really being impressive.  True food does not need be expensize,"}
{"text":"Eat here twice on a recent visit to this great city. Once was for lunch, had a delicious salad with grilled chicken, field greens and fresh strawberries. Others at our table had a nice looking burger, a French dip sandwich and a different salad. Service was excellent and all the food was fresh, tasty and very nicely presented.  We went back for Sunday brunch which was also yummy.  My omelet was cooked perfectly and the asparagus was fresh and flavorful.  Again service was attentive without being hovering or smarmy.  I really liked the eclectic decor and didn't think it was 'grandma -y' at all. I liked the vibe a lot and would happily return on our next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"I think the pastries in the front are disappointing. I've been here several times for brunch and once for dinner. The items on the brunch menu were excellent. Tasty food and attentive service. A+"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast with good French coffee and live piano. The decor is very cozy and you might feel like you are in France enjoying a cup of coffee and its charm. The morning bun was very moist and crunchy on the outside. It was not too sweet which is how I like it"}
{"text":"La Brioche is the type of place that you want to go on a late Saturday morning order a couple mimosas and brunch and just sit for a couple hours. I love the ambiance of the place, I always try to snag a table with the really comfy chairs."}
{"text":"10/10 would come back for brunch! It's a lovely atmosphere - someone was playing the piano live. We also sat in really comfy, large chairs. And our waitress was attentive and funny.   I ordered the Vegetarian Eggs Benedict with garlic mashed potatoes and was in heaven! The Benedict comes on a croissant with asparagus - nice change from your typical Benedict. The garlic potatoes are to die for and the croissant was light and fluffy - exactly as it should be.   They have a cafe in the front too with baked goods and drinks available for purchase, which was great to tide me over until a table was ready. We came around 11:15 on a Sunday for 2. We were told the wait was a half hour but did not wait that long.   All around great find!"}
{"text":"I was in La Brioche recently and the service seems to have gone downhill. The food was still good, however."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Omelettes generous and flavorful. Service was fast and pleasant. Good amount of gluten-free options. Great place for brunch."}
{"text":"You know what I liked about La Brioche today? The waiter and how kind he was to my Mom in her wheelchair. Food's ok, but not as awesome as the prices pretend., or what our memories insist from a lifetime ago. Mocha was enormous, though, and delicious. Gracias, Eduardo."}
{"text":"Any weekend visit to Madison should include brunch at La Brioche. Between the delightful food selection and the charming decor and ambience, it's always a worthwhile stop.   The vegetarian options are wonderful - the vegetarian eggs benedict and chilaquiles are both fine examples. The greens they serve with the egg dishes are always fresh and perfectly dressed with balsamic. And I always get a pot of tea (only $3!) since the owner collects the most adorable tea pots and the teas are delicious.   I also appreciate their efforts to keep the space a technology free zone. I've never had a hard time following the \"no cell phone\" rule because the occasion of sharing a meal with friends or family takes precedence anyway. But it's truly refreshing in today's world to have a break and just enjoy.   I've only ever had good experiences here and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place to have dinner! Decor is stunning with antique sofa chairs and dainty tables - you wouldn't be able to tell how frenchesque the decor is by the outside. Service was great and attentive even when a little understaffed.   Food: Comp bread - really great selection and came out hot and fresh! Squid Ink Pasta - sauce was good and the pasta was al dente. The mix of toppings with corn and green/red peppers kind of threw me off and little too much for the dish.  Lamb Pappardelle - super delish! Lamb was pulled and very soft, great ragu and pasta cooked nicely. Would recommend trying! Dessert- you walk in to this wonderful display of desserts and you see this gigantic creme puff eclair - we had to get it! And it was delicious. Even with the enormous size, the pastry was light and airy and creme was not too sweet.  If you're looking for a cute spot to eat, La Brioche is the place!"}
{"text":"A great place for a relaxed brunch. Three different sections of the room are decorated in different themes. The back feels like a room out of the French Quarter in New Orleans. The front is light and airy. Great food, good service."}
{"text":"The burger was well above average and the potatoes that came with it were fantastic. Everything tastes real...or shall I say \"True\".    I respect their local sourcing and organic bend.  Service was just fine.  We ate outside.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was really torn about whether or not to try La Brioche, due to other Yelper reviews. We decided to toss the dice, and stopped in for brunch this morning.   Yes the decor is...interesting. I don't love it or hate it(although, ladies, you must go into the bathroom...just to see the Citrus Peacock wallpaper. Can't decide if it's so ugly it's cute, or just ugly).   I know service was a big disappointment for other people, but our waitress was average. It was fairly busy in the front, and we chose to sit in back where there were less families with loud children(we're not haters, we just hadn't had any coffee yet).   I tried the feta scramble..which was mediocre. Not bad, but nothing outstanding. The potatoes we split were yummy, and my croissant was good, as mentioned before. My boyfriend's French Toast was amazing. The candied pecans and bananas were good, but the creme anglaise pushed the dish over the top to heavenly. A decadent but delicious way to start any Sunday!  We both thought that the prices were fair, and we'd try it again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch and for dinner. The food has always been good, the service has been really good. It is a bit spendy for what you get and the interior is a little over the top, but I've been there three times so far so that hasn't stopped me."}
{"text":"La Brioche where you can eat organic food while dining in decor more suited for a nursing home.   After coming here a few times now, I truly don't get this place.  I instantly feel 20 years old when I walk in-gaudily upholstered chairs, a piano player in the corner, and stain glass lamps on some of the tables. I respect and value the local, organic food scene as much as the typical Madisonian but listing that your water is not only filtered but also fluoride free is reaching too far.  Even if I agreed that fluoride is the next big evil in the world, me having two glasses with my meal certainly won't kill me. Speaking of meals, I feel La Brioche does a solid job in their offerings.  However, their price points are way too high.  A bacon, egg, and cheese croissant will set you back $10.25 and with a side of berries, the grand total is nearly $16.00.  There are way too many other places in Madison that not only deliver on the food but also don't have the decor of a Golden Girls set."}
{"text":"Cute place with great food! Loved the sweet \"high tea\" ambiance. A nice place to meet a friend for brunch."}
{"text":"Oh the breakfast tacos!  This place is not cheap but you're getting what you pay for.  Top-notch quality."}
{"text":"Great location, beautiful designed interior, stone oven, food and bakery. Don't get the poached salmon my advice get everything else. Everytime we go it's full. Be aware that in the winter it can be a little chilly inside, in the summer outside seating is great. Heads up no dinner service Sundays and Mondays. Tip: some of the vegetarian options can have meat added for the conscious carnivors"}
{"text":"The food here was really great- the vanilla challah french toast was very good, the eggs Benedict were unique, hollandaise a little sweet. Egg dishes came with a great little mixed green salad. Beautiful ambience, especially considering that they are in a strip mall. Only issue was the service- it seemed a little distracted and borderline pretentious. I'd come back though."}
{"text":"I was excited to see chilaquiles, an authentic mexican breakfast on the menu. No one there had any idea what this stuff was. The waitress set down the dish saying \"Here's your, uh, chilli\". It didn't seem like the cook knew what chilaquiles was either. I swear they used feta cheese instead of queso fresco as described on the menu. The tortillas were just a stack of 6 or so pulled out of the bag and plopped onto the plate. You're supposed to cut up and fry your day old tortillas.   It came with the standard baguette and salad as sides, which are kind of weird to have with mexican. After eating a bunch of corn tortilla, you're not pining for a baguette. Some of the salad greens were rotten.  My kid had scrambled eggs and fruit, which looked amazing. I was jealous of him.   Their food looks mostly good, but maybe you should stick to the menu staples."}
{"text":"Stopped in by myself for breakfast. The host took me over to a table by the windows and stated \"There is a 40 degree chill right here\" then proceeded to seat me there anyway. I didn't quite realize what he had said until I felt chilly and noticed an air vent directly above me blowing cold air onto me. 10 minutes later I was really cold and considered asking to be moved but my coffee service had already arrived and I didn't want to be a pain.  The food was decent, the eggs Benedict was the most lemony version I've ever had. The side of greens was soaked in balsamic but luckily I like that sort of thing. Coffee was very good. My waitress was rather indifferent in personality, but still competent and attentive.  La Brioche asks that patrons do not use cell phones which makes me wonder how this place has so many photos and check-ins. Somebody's gotta be on their phone... One thing that stood out to me was the woman who was seated directly behind me who talked very loudly about her job in the medical field, including graphic descriptions of patient's bodily fluids. Any bodily excretion you can think of, she was shouting away about it. Why are people like this??? I realize that's not the restaurant's fault in any way, but I lost my appetite and it colored my experience. I might go back if others suggest it but probably won't return here as a solo diner."}
{"text":"Went to Saturday lunch today.  The positive. It's a beautiful spot. Lots of ambiance and beautifully landscaped. Also the piano music was very nice.  The negative. The sandwiches and soup were not very good. One of my guests ordered a Reuben. It was cold, not even heated through. We sent it back. The next Reuben was hot, but the pretzel it was served on was hard and dry. The Reuben had a lot of orange French dressing on it. I thought at first it was melted Velveeta. French dressing on a Reuben is a first. I've never seen that before. My hamburger was so so.   In general, it looked like more money was spent on landscaping than on quality kitchen staff. Suggest having coffee here perhaps and soaking up the ambiance and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"i met a friend here for lunch today. we were both a bit thrown by the decor and overall atmosphere... i think we were envisioning more of a cafe than a place to have high tea, and we were definitely the only two people in the joint who were not privileged housewives or ancient lunching ladies.   i ordered a half a roast beef sandwich and a cup of potato soup. my friend had a reuben and some tea. my soup and sandwich were alright. the ciabatta that my sandwich was on was probably the best part of the meal.   overall, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. i had heard rave reviews about it but i left disappointed. i might try this place again for dinner or brunch, but i can think of better lunch options."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm a little surprised about the negative reviews too. I love coming here for a special bunch or going out for coffee with my mom. They've got a nice menu with very good food and really good service. Comfy chairs inside and a cute patio outside. For lunch I really like their grilled cheese sandwich.  I've always loved their pastries and cookies (yes, I am a grown-up)  Next time you need to bring a cake for something, they make REALLY good cakes that you can order with a couple of days notice or buy on the spot.  And, they have yummy coffee/espresso drinks! I stopped here this morning for breakfast on the go and got the croissant sandwich, which was a very generous size. The good news is that meals come with a fresh salad (a good mix of greens). That way you can feel better about finishing all of your food. Next time, I think I'm going to have the breakfast tacos - or the crepes."}
{"text":"Brunch Club hit La Brioche this week to step up our barely-A.M. dining. The place was surprisingly glamorous considering it is in a plaza off University across from IHOP. The decor is elegant-meets-eclectic and they have a whole thing about the feng shui of the place (really... you can read about it here: http://labriochetruefood.com/feng-shui.html).  Anyway, ze food. I got Old World Porridge (I know, not the sexiest option and nothing to write home about) but it was one of the few veggie options available that time of day. My brunchmates got the feta scramble (eggs, feta, sundried tomatoes, arugula) and Black Forest ham/cheddar/asparagus omelette respectively. They both enjoyed their meals but we agreed the prices were a little steep. To be fair! Many of the menu items were organic and local (eggs, salad mix, tomatoes, berries), which is ia big draw to come back and give it another go.  The service was great-- our waitress was bubbly and helpful answering our questions. I'd go back to try another meal...perhaps dinner? They have a long list of stone oven pizzas and house-made pastas that look damn enticing..."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to count the number of times my husband or I have said, \"We should try La Brioche one of these days.\" Well, we finally did it. We had friends in town for the weekend and decided a bunch at La Brioche would be a great way to kick off a Saturday.   The parking lot was packed when we got there at 10am, which led me to think it would be busy in the restaurant, but I'd say the place was 1/2-3/4 full (I think people had used the parking lot for a swim meet next door). There were tables available outside and it was a gorgeous morning so we sat outside (it was also pretty loud inside, lots of people talking and loud music, which I personally don't enjoy when dining with friends).   Our waitress was polite and friendly. There are standard coffee choices (black, latte, mocha) in addition to a few fancier things (Miel, Matcha Latte, etc). Since it was brunch, that was the menu we worked with. There are simply too many choices (I kinda wish it had been a bit paired down), but I went with the Vanilla Challah French Toast with bananas and toasted pecans. It was THE BEST DECISION EVER! The bread was warm and custardy, and while they served it with a side of maple syrup - there was no need to add to my impending diabetic coma. My husband had the eggs benedict which did not disappoint. A third member of our group tried the daily quiche (there's a meat and a veggie option) which was Bacon Cheeseburger this particular morning. All said, we had a beautiful brunch with delicious food, drink, and company.   Prices are a bit higher, but honestly not horrible. I wouldn't spend this much on a weekly basis, but once a month isn't out of the question.   The last thing I really liked was a sign on the door and a listing on the menu that asked patrons to refrain from using cell phones and laptops in the restaurant. While I'm sure that will ruffle a few coffee shop regulars, I found it refreshing to be away from technology if only for an hour."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here is fantastic! Sitting in the old fashioned high backed arm chairs nestled up to a little table, sipping on local organic coffee and debating whether or not the cinnamon buns should be eaten now, or later! The food is good, nothing fancy but super tasty. We had the four cheese quiche and the chilequildelia (spelling?) both of which are perfectly portioned. The side of roasted potatoes is enough to share, so be careful. The bakery was delicious, the chocolate croissant was incredible and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something not to heavy but sweet!"}
{"text":"It's not my first time.....but we did NOT enjoy the food today.  The salad was \"tired\".....two or more days old.  The Croissant was old - not fresh as it should.  And the bread was not fresh.  And the server was \"not nice\" - nothing specific but \"not nice\" is the right terms here.  We visit here more than few times but today was a disappointed visit"}
{"text":"Just over a year after the first review, I find myself here again.  This time, the goal was to create a meal out of two individual items that would,  when consumed a la carte be considered a snack.  I zeroed in on a small cherry walnut salad ($7) and a fish taco ($7).  An expensive snack/meal to be sure, and I was left with mixed results.  The salad is reliably satisfying creation that has a distinct composite envelope of flavor and texture.  The mixed greens, parmesan, dried cherries and vinaigrette dressing were pleasing enough, though nothing about it beckoned for a return visit anytime soon.  The fish taco was an entirely different and much more disappointing experience.  While the idea of fish tacos is nothing new, and even the inclusion of tilapia is now a fairly standard option, the unpleasant surprise here was the extra step of infusing a hickory-smoked flavoring on the fish, with only a small bed of cilantro for contrast.  The resulting taste made me wonder if this menu item had been rescued from a recent structure fire, as the smoke aura was so monochromatic as to eliminate all other dimensions of flavor.  Perhaps a small dab of chipotle salsa as an additional accessory may have rescued this victim, but in it's current form, no such luck.  Incidentally, the entrees were a limited and expensive situation.  I believe it would be to the kitchen's advantage to consider a more seasonal menu, taking advantage of local seasonal produce, rather than a continuous merry-go-round of the same views."}
{"text":"The decor is awesome, I love it! They also make really good chai tea lattes and I enjoy having breakfast here (decent menu, a little pricey). However, the past three times that I have purchased a baked good, they have all been stale. I have had coworkers who have had stale bakery items as well in the past months or so. These stale items include cupcakes, muffins and scones. I love the ambiance, it is very home-y but stale baked goods for a bakery like La Brioche is disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is just a treasure!! It's so cozy classy and quaint. The food is so pure & delicious and fresh tasting!! I had heard great things about this place so my gf & I had to check it out & have a girls brunch. We loved it and had a blast. Eggs Benedict insane delish & she had breakfast tacos & raved about them!!"}
{"text":"I went here to meet a friend from out of town for breakfast on a Wednesday morning around 8:30. It was not super busy, but also not as empty as I would have guessed for a random weekday. The staff person at the front counter was very friendly. There appeared to be plenty of staff on hand. Despite this, I was really surprised at the slow service. I wasn't timing anything, but it took abnormally long for her to come over to greet us, take our orders, refill coffee, and bring the check. I would usually give a pass for this in a very busy place with only one server, but this was not the case. Overall, the food was excellent! I think the prices are a little high, but the ingredients are high quality and the food is cooked well. It's worth the price. I was surprised at the coffee though -- $3 for one cup of regular coffee?! It wasn't really anything special to me, although it was noted as being local in the menu. One could argue you are paying for a quality, local product, but still, $3+ is what I pay for specialty drinks, not a plain cup of coffee. I would go back for the great tasting food and hope the service was just a random experience."}
{"text":"Great food! And great ambience! The food service could be faster though. It took close to 10 minutes before the waitress greeted us. And be careful which time you go because the menu changes. I do highly recommend their desserts. YUM!"}
{"text":"We've taken the kid here several times for sunday brunch. To be honest, the experiences have been un-impressive."}
{"text":"I came here with some family members for my college graduation. I was so surprised to see the restaurant empty because 1. all of the other restaurants I tried booking were completely full with graduation reservations and 2. La Brioche is always so packed for brunch time.  To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of their brunch. I heard so many great things about the brunch and was a little disappointed. HOWEVER, the dinner menu is great. I really enjoyed eating their wild-caught salmon. The portion size is big, and more importantly, it's delicious. The owner mentioned something about knowing a guy who goes to Alaska twice a year and brings back a lot of wild salmon.  Their desserts are also really good. My favorite is the tres leches cake. The first one I ever tried was here, and it was so good I started craving tres leches all the time afterwards. I tried tres leches cake at other restaurants was learned that the one I had at La Brioche is pretty different from the typical one - however, I find it to be better tasting.  5-stars to the owners and waitstaff for their friendly service and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Nice bakery food with friendly service  Went here for brunch on Saturday.  Lots of selections for us egg eaters.  I had a good scramble with standard greens.  The balsamic didn't really go with my scramble but it wasn't bad. The eggs Benedict looked amazing.  Others had a big cinnamon roll and a morning bun which is the real reason to go here.  Ya gotta have one of those!  Service was great.  Very attentive and asked all the right questions about the complicated drinks.  Even whether we wanted raisins on our rolls.  Nice brunch or lunch spot.  I would go again."}
{"text":"In summary,  La Pretentious/Truly over-hyped.  And I'm talking about both food and service.  For Sunday brunch, I ordered feta scramble, which came with unimpressive taste, accompanied by overdressed salad (major turn off) and a piece of whatever-grade toast - wait, they're supposed to be a bakery, right?  My bf's omelet - ugh, mentioning would be a waste of space. My friend's egg benedict - ordered with the poached egg medium done. What they brought out instead was wrong kind of egg benedict with super runny yolk that unfortunately decided to spill and ran to my friend's crotch. We sent it back and they brought us newly cooked mediocre dish.  Piece of advise: Perkin's omelet can give La Brioche a serious run for the money, not to mention that Perkin's also would have a lot more pleasant staff, and better Feng Shui. Who cares about the pages of brochure going on and on about the ugly decor? Give us the true good food and solid service, and that should be enough to put patrons in good mood."}
{"text":"Here we go again. So many people told me how good this place was. I don't know what they are eating or what they are comparing it to, it is horrible. Jay P. who says he is from DC, nailed the description of the omelette perfectly. The service is abysmal, which really hurts a restaurant such as this. When you can't fall back on the food to be good, and your service fails you, you have nothing left. The name implies 'french.\" One bite of a croissant tells you it should be called La Pillsbury. The coffee is good, but it is no secret, it's Kickapoo, which is a pretty good coffee.  The bland food, the horrible croissant, the uninteresting and dated selection of menu choices does nothing to bring me back, and it won't."}
{"text":"I have had the most horrible experience at this restaurant on several occassions.  And, these experiences could be very costly for me.  I have decided (un-wisley) to use Labrioche as a meeting place with potential clients.  On two separate occasions I made arrangements to meet a client for coffee or lunch and asked the manager that I was waiting for someone.  On both occasions, the person I was meeting was sitting at the restaurant also waiting for someone to meet them.  Both times, I sat and waited and consistently asked wait staff and other staff is there was someone waiting for someone and they would say no.  The person I was meeting was consistently asking as well and they were told the same thing.  I was waiting inside the restaurant the person I was meeting was sitting outside.  I asked if there was someone waiting outside and I was told no.  Although, my friend was asking the same question and she was told no.  This has happened twice, the same time, same staff and unfortunately with the same person.  I have gotten better service at Denny's of IHOP.  There is some kind of communication breakdown, because I have seen this happen with other people too."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Decor is soothing and classy. Jas the waitress was friendly and prompt. Our fresh food, I had green eggs and ham, was flavorful, not too filling, healthy and fresh. My only issue is it's a tad overpriced for what you get. Definitely and must place in Madison for brunch."}
{"text":"I don't get the allure.  Is it the furniture?  The water pitchers?   When I go out to eat I want food that tastes great. It's why I have decided not to cook and actually leave my abode to go spend money somewhere else. And the food I've had just doesn't wow me. Now I've only been for breakfast, so maybe things really get exciting around lunchtime? Add to this the fact that servers are a bit aloof (I find myself having to repeatedly ask for things) and the insane prices for eggs (I get the whole true food thing, I do) and it's just not a place I'll find myself returning to soon."}
{"text":"After reading all these reviews, I decided to give La Brioche a try because I love pastries.   Unfortunately, I will have to say that for 75 cents less--Whole Foods croissants are better than La Brioche. The chocolate croissant I got from La Brioche was DRY and not buttery or flaky like it's suppose to be. The chocolate inside the chocolate croissant was also CHEAP CANDY MELTS! For a restaurant that tries to advertise organic and wholesome food products, I would expect them to use a better chocolate. Not only was the croissant dry, but the croissant was also tough to chew and felt like it was a few days old. I felt like I was eating cardboard instead of a croissant. I definitely won't be getting pastries from La Brioche in the future!    If you are looking for good pastries, then I would recommend going to Graze near the downtown capital square during farmer's market! Their pastries are so fresh, warm, soft, and delicious! I am in love with s'more cronut!!!"}
{"text":"If I didn't know how awful they treat their employees I'd give this a three to four star rating. I also witnessed cockroaches."}
{"text":"Go here for brunch! My husband and I went to La Brioche on a Saturday morning and were not disappointed. We had a short wait, but it was worth it for the food. We tried an omelette and the open-faced roasted vegetable sandwich and both were very good.  Make sure to save room for dessert. They're bakery case is full of decadent treats. The cream puff was just ok, but the red velvet cupcake was great!  We also appreciated the little touches like the good service & cute decor."}
{"text":"I was a regular at their original location. It was 100% Mom and Pop, right down to the vinyl gingham table \"cloths\" and napkin dispensers on the tables.  Now, if you stop in to buy something from the bakery (which is primarily what the last location was - a bakery), you're not treated very well - almost like you're wasting the staff's time.  Plus, $2 for a glass of milk for my kid - I don't think so. I'd take the old place back in a heart beat, but the pretentiousness and price of this new version are a real let down."}
{"text":"First time to la brioche and the entire experience was stellar! Speedy host, despite the line of people and practically full restaurant, and we were able to get the outside table we requested. Waitress was efficient with delivering our bloody Mary's after her eloquent description of the flavors. Food took appropriate amount of time and the portions were perfect for a hungry man, and I had a few leftovers, primarily the delicious breakfast potatoes.   Food: eggs Benedict, spicy Bloody Mary, breakfast potatoes. The asparagus on the Benedict was a nice touch, in addition to the croissant breading. Bloody had infused peppers in the vodka, so the Tabasco flavor wasn't present. Very well described by Andrea and the spicy was a slow creep of strength. Potatoes needed more salt but had great flavor!  Service: waitress was very knowledgeable and checked on us an appropriate amount of times. Andrea was a self proclaimed foodie and I can now confirm, she knew it well and left me satisfied.   Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"La Brioche is very close to my work place.  My usual visits are a quick stop for a morning bun and the Double Miel to go.  I find the staff friendly and quick.  My dining-in experiences are less frequent and are, again, usually in the morning for the breakfasts.  I had a surprise visit from a former coworker so we decided to met up at La Brioche for dinner this past Tuesday.  I got there first and was snagged a four top for my group ( one in a wheelchair ).  I got the table set up right for the group and ordered the Earl Mint tea for my wait.  Loose leave tea and a nice sized tea pot of hot water was brought.   I mixed in a little honey and it was so good.  I may have to come in the morning early for the newspaper and tea before work.  My wait (for my friends) was a bit longer than I expected.  The server was considerate to check on me periodically.  I did take my phone out for a quick text to see where my group was.  I respect their rule about cell phones.  It makes the space more relaxing without tables all chatting up their phones.  And since my phone was out, I snapped a picture of the menu and of the tea.  I am a Yelper, after all!  When my group finally arrived, I ordered the Quiche Lorriane.  It is served with potatoes and salad but I asked if I could exchange the potatoes for acorn squash.  They did and that was such a good choice.  I really like the salad, too.  It is dressed with a balsamic dressing that is very good.  The Quiche was good and I would get it again.  Price points for the restaurant are a bit high but the quality of food is there so I'm okay with it.  La Brioche is a nice relaxing restaurant."}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch.  I would say it's good and I would go again but not quite worth of a 5 star review.  Waiter service was good except that I was lacking water at the end of my meal.  FYI, this place is notorious for banning any sort of laptop or cellphone use inside their restaurant. Hot chocolate: very good but you MUST get the larger size, the smaller is in a teacup. Old world porridge: strangely good. At first I thought, \"man, this is not very good\" but it grew on me and I went back for it again.  It is served with old fashioned oats and cream rather than just water.  Brown sugar and a small portion of berries are on the side. Breakfast potatoes: these stand out a bit because they are super garlicky!  I thought they were good but they were much more garlicky than any other breakfast potato I've had. Quiche with ham: This is the winner!  I'm not a quiche person but I think this is the best quiche I've ever had and my dining companion agreed.  Fun fact: go here just before close and you can get 6 morning buns for $5, a steal considering that 1 morning bun is about $2.50 at normal prices"}
{"text":"What a cute place! I love the comforting/cozy atmosphere at La Brioche. We had a very kind waitress who was personable and talkative, and the food was overall pretty good!     I started off with a butter croissant, which was very tasty. Only complaint is that the butter to spread onto the croissant wasn't very soft so it made it pretty difficult to spread, however the croissant tasted great without the extra butter :)    Each of us eating that morning ordered something different:   One friend had the  Vanilla Challah French Toast -- made with crème Anglaise and her choice of berries (otherwise you can choose caramelized pecans and bananas). She absolutely loved it, and I had a bite and must say it was delicious! Definitely get this is you're looking for something sweet for breakfast.     On the other hand, my other friend and myself went with the savory options. I'm pretty sure my friend ordered something off of their breakfast specials menu -- which was made with potatoes, eggs, veggies (mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc.) and she opted to add breakfast sausage into the mix as well. It looked great, and she said she really liked it!     For me, I had the Feta Scramble -- made with eggs, feta, sundried tomatoes, and arugula. It was served with the organic spring mix salad and a slice of baguette on the side. While the scramble was good, I don't think I'd get it again. It felt as though there was not much egg in the scramble, and there was a lot of arugula. I love arugula, but I felt like there was something lacking -- maybe some meat? I think next time I would ask to add sausage to it or go with another menu item, since I left satisfied, but not very full. If I wouldn't have had the croissant beforehand, I think I would have still been hungry after eating!     Overall, I really do like La Brioche and I know I'll be making return visits in the future! I'd love to try their Pesto \"Green Eggs and Ham\" Scramble next time. Their menu seems a bit more expensive than other breakfast options in the area -- but I think the extra few dollars are worth it every once in a while :)"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in the food here. The only thing that was good was the tomato bisque soup. I had 1/2 beef sandwich which was horrible also. Took 4 scones home and threw them in the garbage, they were all tasteless. I would skip La Brioche, there are so many other terrific restaurants in Madison, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The pastries are great, and the environment is cozy. But I have to say, the service here is terrible. I stopped in today to buy a box of pastries to bring to work. I told the young woman at the counter I wanted a dozen pastries. She asked me how many I wanted.  She then chose a box and began filling it with pastries according to my direction. But the box did not hold a dozen pastries and she had to put several additional pastries in a separate paper bag. I asked if it was possible to have a shopping bag that I could carry both the box and bag in. She told me that they had shopping bags, but that the boxes they have would not fit in the bag.  While we were having this discussion, another woman came in asking to order a large iced tea. The staffer at the counter chose a cup and began to fill it, at which point the customer said that that was not the size she usually got.  The staff person replied that they were out of the larger cups. No apology, no offer to fill two instead of one, nothing. The customer finally said that she would go elsewhere for her tea and left.  They seemed unconcerned. Meanwhile, I struggled to my office with a bag of pastries balanced on top of a box. Rarely do I have the experience of dropping $40 and feeling like the business where I'm spending my money is doing me a favor.  Come on, guys, get it together."}
{"text":"I thought I had figured out how to have a good meal at La Brioche: take out.  I very much enjoy the organic burger and some of the omelets, and, with take out, I had been able to avoid the horrible service.  Alas, no more.    I called in an order for my usual burger with avocado and swiss, stating I would be right over.  I arrived, paid for it, and waited.  And waited.  I checked, only to find that the person who took my call had indicated that I would pick it up one hour later than I had said.  No apology from the staff involved, barely an apology from another staff member, and certainly no gesture like, \"Please, have a pastry on us.\"  I am done with True Foods.  Madison has a number of other restaurants with better food and much, much better service.  Incidentally, while waiting for my missing order, I discovered how to get good service at True Food: have a relationship with a staff member.  A young women who was apparently attached in some fashion (girlfriend?) to a staff member received lavish attention from that person and other staff.  So, unless you are related to someone who works at True Food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, good bread, and acceptable food. This place is nothing to write home about but it is perfectly good enough, has comfortable seating, a lovely patio, and good service. Most importantly, as far as I am concerned, they don't make you feel rushed while eating, even when service is busy. Also, at brunch their veggie eggs Benedict is quite tasty; however there aren't a ton of options for vegetarians who prefer savory food to sweets."}
{"text":"Should be 4.5 stars, but no way to give it that. The food is good. The bakery items are amazing. We had a party of five arrive at 9:30am on a Sunday, and although they told us we would wait for 50-60 minutes, it really was only 15 minutes. I definitely recommend getting there early on Sunday morning for brunch. They let us have free coffee and tea while we waited. The coffee and tea was delicious! The noise level was pretty annoying the whole time (bad acoustics and lots of people talking) so we had to speak very loudly to each other. When we got to the table, we ordered some pastries right away. The cream puff for $5 was delicious and when split 5 ways, it worked out. I would not recommend trying to eat that huge thing with fewer people. The cream was perfect and stiff, the chocolate on top was excellent, and the strawberries on top and in the middle were a wonderful surprise. The morning bun was also very good, although those aren't really my thing. It didn't taste overly sugary though and it was wonderfully fresh and airy. The food itself was not quite as good as the bakery items. The side salads all had a slightly overwhelmingly bitter tasting vinaigrette. The vegetarian quiche was delicious except that it tasted like there was either bacon or lard somewhere in it. My dish was the breakfast tacos and I substituted cheddar cheese for the chorizo to make them vegetarian. It was good, but was missing a bold, unifying flavor. It probably would have been better with retried beans to pull all the other flavors together (especially if you're not going to have chorizo). My aunt ordered a fried egg, which was, you know, a fried egg. The garlic potatoes received mixed reviews from our table - some loved it and some thought they were greasy and not crispy enough. I thought they were good and very well seasoned."}
{"text":"A very decent place for lunch within a short distance from UW Hospital. I've eaten here twice now and the experience was consistently decent. Service is brisk and polite. Menu variety is ok and their mixed greens are consistently fresh and light. This is not my preferred style of food-an upscale Au Bon Pain if you will-so it's hard for me to be excited by it. But it is nice and eventually we all tire of hospital food."}
{"text":"I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.  We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.  We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.  The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.  Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon."}
{"text":"La Brioche is something that must be tried, but they have some big flaws and it's not something everyone will like.  First off, they have the best Croissant ever made.  Period.  I've been to the \"actual\" La Brioche in France, and I still like the Croissants here better than anywhere else, so that's saying a lot.  The Chocolate Croissants are equally as good, so don't skimp when you go there.  The Croissant has a nice hard shell (not hard like stale bread, good hard), and a creamy-butter taste that you'll be longing for after you leave.  Plus, almost zero flakiness like most other quality Croissant makers.  Secondly, the restaurant itself is fairly new (they used to have a small bakery down the street), and they did a nice job with the furnishings.  It looks very victorian vintage, with a unique color layout and pleasant dining areas.  There's also an outdoor section when it's nice outside, and a comfortable waiting area when they're busy.  Those things said, they have a HUGE problem with service.  At the old bakery, there was 1 or 2 curmudgeon employees who were extremely rude no matter how you approached them.  At this new restaurant, there's now a handful of people who share that behavior, except they also have inexperience and no tact to add to the list.  Additionally, the food items are hit or miss.  They all have a little something off about them, and the presentation is pretty basic considering the steep prices.  My Recommendation -   Stop in and buy a few Croissants, don't stay for lunch."}
{"text":"The food can be good but the service is arrogant and crappy.  They have no manager and the owner sits back in his office and rarely makes it out to see what is going on.  It's all a little overpriced too and the ambience is pretentious and stupid.  The place looks like a grandma on crack decorated it.  A restaurant in a strip mall should not be this pretentious."}
{"text":"This is my go-to brunch spot: consistent, high-quality ingredients and polite staff. If you are feeling indulgent, try a morning bun before they sell out. Otherwise the brioche french toast or feta scramble are wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is always good tasting but very overpriced. I ordered a small salad which seemed reasonably priced at $7, but I didn't read the menu closely and they added another $6 for chicken! I went there on a lunch date with the 2-year-old I was babysitting and they were very accommodating with the little one- they had lots of books and crayons and a great children's menu.  The brunch is also more expensive on the weekends than the weekdays, which I found out first-hand- next time I will be sure to check the menu before I go somewhere!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the reviewers who moved to Madison who are disappointed in the overall quality of Madison restaurants, yet remain hopeful (what else can you do?) that things might improve. I don't think La Brioche is helping things improve. To me, it felt like a really amateur attempt at a restaurant. The food was just not that interesting and the service was worse, but for me, the decor was the nail in the coffin! They took a nice contemporary kitchen and mixed it with these crazy upholstered barrel chairs that look like they went missing from the House on the Rock. Not going back."}
