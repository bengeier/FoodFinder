{"text":"nice to have a taste of home in las vegas.. we only had the crab cakes... but the were good...not great.......probably coulda used some more dry mustard and old bay....really looking forward to coming back for some crabs............ HOW BOUT DEM O'S HON..."}
{"text":"This place provides far more than a meal! It was a great experience with an awesome environment. Also a good place to catch the big game on one of the many tvs. Two thumbs up..."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.   I'm 99% sure they just take Campbells vegetable soup and add a little crab.   Crab cakes were expensive and only slightly above average.   The hush puppies were pretty legit though."}
{"text":"Terrible place to go...management  does not support poor customer  experience. ..food is just par..had oysters. So small..must be seconds...do not recommend  to eat there...worse food and services"}
{"text":"#1 spot for crabs in Las Vegas!

I've been here 4 times in 2 weeks. And each time it's been fantastic!

Crabs are cooked then tossed in a dry spice. Perfect!

Service is very friendly, and they always take time to explain how to eat the crabs. They also use iphones to take orders, so it's not like they are ignoring you. 

I like the casual vibe of the place. Brown paper is put on the table, wooden mallets are handed around, a plastic bucket plonked next. 

When crabs are ready, they are piled steaming hot right onto the middle of the table. 

Remember to ask for a paper bib before you start!

Melted butter is good with the crabs. Also a green chili + vinegar sauce. 

For the two weeks I was around:

Mondays. All You Can It Medium Size Crabs for $35
Tuesdays. $2 small crab and $2 domestic beers
Wednesdays. $20 lobsters
Thursdays. $3 medium crab and $3 beers
Sundays. $1 oysters

Definitely will return and have recommended to everyone I meet."}
{"text":"I am totally addicted to seafood. I like trying to find places that serve fresh seafood around Las Vegas since it can be hard. I yelped Crab Corner and the reviews were all great, so my family and I decided to try it out for ourselves. 

When we arrived there was only one table taken, I was shocked that it wasn't packed but glad since we didn't have to wait to be seated. My family and I ordered the hush puppies, calamari, Boardwalk fries, crawfish, and a dozen blue crab. The hush puppies were delicious one of the best hush puppies I have tried. My niece and daughter loved the crawfish so much that we had to order them another pound. The blue crab was as fresh as can be since they do get it shipped from Maryland. They have vinegar to dip your crab in, yes I said vinegar! It's pretty hard to find any seafood places that carry vinegar around here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great selection of seafoods all at a reasonable price. They also have a good selection of sides. Definite must try's: the crab legs, clams, shrimp and oysters. If the weather is nice, make sure you sit out on the patio!"}
{"text":"This is the only place we can get our fix for Maryland style blue crabs.  We always order large females with extra oldbay seasoning and we take it to go. The staff is ok and the place is a bit small.  I tried their Ahi salad and was not too happy with it. The only other things we didn't like is when we call to put our order in they are already out of large females and its pricey.  The only reason we come here is because this is the only place that serves blue crabs Maryland style."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  I want to marry my server  Jarred so I can live happily ever after eating cream of crab soup, soft shell crabs, peel and eat shrimp, & corn on the cob every night!"}
{"text":"Great food. It is hard to find quality Maryland style crab cakes outside of Maryland. This place delivers.  

Service is prompt, professional and personal. 

Only drawback is the music. Lunch time is hardly the time for loud club dance music.  Music selection apparently is for the staff not the customers."}
{"text":"best Maryland style blue crab joint u are ever gonna find outside of delmarva.  Most places in the dc area aren't even this good.  While nothing can touch true Chesapeake bay eastern shore places this Feels like a true Baltimore spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place . They have amazing seafood and and great drinks to enjoy with your friends I highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"1) service was not very good. Did not recommend what to get for a first timer.

2) not a lot of meat on the crabs.

3) good environment to get crackin.

4) oysters were amazing!

5) overall I would say it was ok. The oysters were definitely the best!"}
{"text":"Best seafood, I like alot, seafood is well season .nice atmosphere nice music . Every time I go have dinner they always treat me with respect. Their service is also very fast.  Its a good place to take your whole family for lunch or dinner. Highly recommend to every1."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and had great service and a good quality meal. The bartenders, Sam and Bryan, were very friendly and informative. I'm a newbie to Maryland style seafood so I had to ask Sam how to eat the Maryland Blue Crab. Even though it was my first one I could tell it was fresh and of good quality. Sam suggested the $1 happy hour oysters. I'm glad he did because they were delicious. Fresh and buttery. Their crab cakes are some of the best I've had. They're mostly crab meat. Hardly any breading. Lightly broiled and delicious.

This place is definitely worth a try. If your looking to watch a game the bar area has plenty of flat screens and good sound. You can either belly up to the bar, or sit at a table and watch a game. The bar is half inside and half outside on the patio. When the weather warms up the patio bar seating will be a great spot to eat, drink, and watch a game."}
{"text":"My crab cakes were delish; nothing but sweet tender crab meat! Hubby had catfish filet and fries, which he enjoyed. Service was pleasant and efficient. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. The food is beyond excellent! I find myself having serious cravings for it. Like when you need a Bloody Mary after a \"stupid me, why'd is I do this to my body\" night. That's how good they food is. We need more places like this in vegas."}
{"text":"This was my first experience cracking whole crabs and is was great.  Fresh, tasty and extra affordable on Tuesdays. It's a great spot to eat when you have some time to roll up your sleeves and get messy."}
{"text":"This place takes me right back to my childhood visits to family in Baltimore. Everything I've had here has been fantastic. The crab soup is the business, and the crab cakes are very crabby with so little filler and so much flavor! Obviously, the crabs are great. 

Authentic and delicious with good friendly service. I can't think how it could be better."}
{"text":"Great food! We had peel & eat shrimp and the blue crabs in garlic butter. Lots of flavor in the seasoning but not so much to overpower the food.  Blue crab is harder to crack than dungenous so be prepared for a workout if you get the blues! The meat is sweet ao get at least a few. The service was fantastic and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Definitely a thumbs down. Not going back. Mediocre food. Customer service was not good. I don't normally give bad reviews but this place took the cake for me. Shaking my head on how bad the customer service and food were.....We were driving by this shack and my husband said, \"hey I'm starving, let's get some food...how about that place? I said, well the last time we were there(2 yrs ago) we looked at their menu and walked out, but why the heck not, let's give it another shot. I ordered food to go since my baby was still sleeping in the car and we didn't wanna wake her up. Few minutes later she woke up so my husband decided that we should it at the restaurant instead. so I asked the host, she said I'll ask the manager. The host was nice and friendly that's why I gave this place 2 stars.

So my husband left to go to the bathroom. I sat down and waited. Then I overheard this lady saying to the host \"to go is to go\" she wasn't happy about it she acted like a b*tch! She finally came up to me and so I said we can't even even seat down and eat here instead? Then she said it again...well did u order it to go? I said yep, then she said ......to go is go and I said yeah but we are starving and we want to eat here.

She looked at me for a second and said okayyyy in an annoyed voice and expression, she turned around and talked to the cook she got our food on the table. Food was ok, the best thing about it was the green beans. The blue crab hard shell 11.99/lb was not good there was nothing in it and it's small, it looks like a skeleton, good thing I'm on a diet so I didn't care on eating it much!!!! It was saut√©ed with lots of butter. My husband had fish and chips, there were no chips but it comes with 2 sides. Fish was ok we had better. We had to ask for water few minutes later and we had to help ourselves with some to go boxes. No one came to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. Bad customer service. You know the saying goes...you get what you paid for...LoL....I tip the front 10% for to go order and I was going to tip 20% for dining but since it was so bad we decided to leave and didn't leave a tip on the table. What a big disappointment! We always go to Tommy Bahama's restaurant at town square, the ambiance is 100X better and food is excellent, food might be a bit expensive but it's worth it. Not going back to crab corner, We don't like the crabby customer service. We should have listened to our instincts."}
{"text":"Service: great! The waitress who took our orders and the guy that delivered our foods to the table were friendly and attentive.

Foods: Not very pleased! The sauce were almost bland (we got the sampler). It seems like the seafoods were frozen and as they cooked, the ice thawed out and watered down the sauce. At least that's how I'd imagine what happened. The crab itself was very salty though.

Prices: I expect for seafoods to be slightly expensive but I'd willingly pay that price if the food tastes weren't disappointing!

Happy ending: it was my birthday. They gave me free dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place! First time tearing crabs apart, the crabs tasted wonderful and the service was awesome. Will go back again ;-)"}
{"text":"Forgot the names of the two guys that served my bf and I, but they were very helpful and one of them even offered for us to try their new hawaiin beer on tap. How could you say no to $2 beer? it was really good btw. It feels similar to boiling crab but they got their own thing going on with blue shell crabs and all. even though we didnt eat that, we were still very pleasantly happy with our pound of shrimp and crab cake burger and potato fries. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place. It reminds me of back east. Everything about makes me feel as if I were back home in Maryland. If I didn't live so far from the crab corner I would eat there every day"}
{"text":"So i was visiting vegas from la recently and drove by and this place caught my eye, this establishment rocks! I am a seafood junkie and this place did not disappoint, I just wish there were a crab corner by me. The garlic crab, the blue crab, the calamari, and the hush puppies are to die for, I'll be craving these until I can visit again. The two brothers who run this place are so nice and attentive and the prices are surprisingly low. Try this place out if you love seafood and I promise, you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are were born and raised in Hawaii. We are always looking for great crab and lobster restaurants to indulge in. We stopped at the Crab Corner on Eastern and Flamingo. We were very happy with the lobster,  Alaskan king crab, bottle neck clams and the crab salad appetizer. The prices were very reasonable for the amount we ordered. The great part was we are Primo fans, they serve Primo beer. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Visiting here.  I'm originally from Maryland and have to admit I have a chip on my shoulder when a place says \"Maryland \" crabs.  Trouble is I went there for crabs but they had a lobster special that I couldn't pass up.  They were cooked perfectly, the coleslaw was great, as well as the potato salad.  Guess I'll have to go back next Monday when they have all you can eat crabs.  I'm not easy to please when it comes to seafood, but this place does it.  Great service too.  AJ was our waiter and he was top notch."}
{"text":"first time here. i'm from philly and have been missing a real seafood joint.to those complaining about the prices, get over it. seafood is expensive, and this stuff is being flown in from the east coast. people here complain about the service but I did not have any problems with that.denise at the bar was great and I had some questions about some of the food that she couldn't answer so she didn't try to snow me or blow me off. she got a.j.' who I will assume was the manager, and he answered all my questions and was great. ordered mini crab cakes, scallops wrapped in bacon, and mozzarella sticks to go. it did take a while but I was in no hurry and didn't care. just got another beer.food was great. crab cakes were all crab and not loaded with filler.scallops surprised me because i'm used to the big sea scallops. these were the small bay scallops. they were great. I would say if your in a hurry not to go here but that's not what a crabhouse is.kick back, relax enjoy the food and have another beer. just watch out for all those crazy women with hammers smashing those poor crabs.can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best East Coast seafood in all of Vegas!! One of our favorite places. Best Maryland crabs and clams."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this yummy restaurant and will be back! The seafood is so fresh!  The bartender,  Sam,  was so personable and really knows the menu. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've read all the reviews, so I guess I was there on an off night.  We went on a Thursday night, around 6:00 PM.  It wasn't crowded, but there were quite a few people there, and one vastly overworked server.  While there were empty tables, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (another couple waited longer), and another 15 minutes to place our order (the same other couple still waited longer).  My sister-in-law lived in Maryland for a long time, and loves crab.  I've been to Maryland several times and was looking forward to this.  We had gone before on a Friday night and when we learned the wait was over 30 minutes, went elsewhere, so we had our hopes up.  Mistake.  My wife and sister-in-law ordered the crabcakes.  One had french fries and one had sweet potato fires.  I had the soft shell crab and onion rings, with coleslaw.  We received our order about 20 minutes after placing it.  A beer would have made the wait a bit more pleasant, but they won't have a license until February.  My sister-in-law's comment about the crabcakes was that she had had worse (she's kind), while I thought my wife's were a bit mealy.  My soft shell crab came hot, but relatively tasteless; the onion rings might have come from the supermarket freezer, and the coleslaw was soggy (I love coleslaw) and flat.  The tartar sauce had an odd flavor, so we left it alone.  The fries, both varieties, were ok.   All in all, for the above order, plus soft drinks, $60+ wasn't too bad, if it had been good, but with the wait, the taste (or lack thereof), we won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious crawfish! The sauce that they're served in is so delicious! The staff was very nice and showed us how to take apart the blue crab.  Yummy big fat shrimp!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Me lovin some real home town crabs lately! Went here for the first time 2 Saturdays ago bout 3 pm with my bff's for the happy hour yummy skipjack oysters for a mere $1.... Best I've had since living in Annapolis! And unbelievable bar selections for $3! My tummy jumped for joy when the blue crabs touched my tongue! Perfectly steamed with delicious J.o seasoning. My server Jim was courteous and freakin' hilarious , not to mention cute too!!!. The mgr- host Brian was also from maryland talked to us professionally brought out some live ones to show us and taught my newbie girls how to crack em' faster than emeril!  Wow! After din we played shuffleboard & the bartender Sam showed how to play the real way and brought us over some of the best signature drinks on and off the menu and was a complete sweetheart! Sam even tuned into the game we wanted on.... Place overall made me so happy and homesick all at once....                                                                 

Now for why the 4 stars and not 5.... Went back this last sat with my girlies again and half the place was reserved for a sip and paint event :( looked like fun unless u wanted to eat... Got there at 5 and they were setting up. Our server Jim was gone ( another :(   ) Brian was moving tables came  over apologized profusely ( he was soooo sweet!) and asked the night server to get us in ASAP! Night server...... Ugh!!!! Asian guy that barely spoke to us ( wearing a shirt with transformers or something... Don't remember them being from maryland.... Wtf???) led us to some tables by bar threw down some menus and left.... Luckily Sam was there again but switching to night shift  :( ... Served us a round ( awesome drinks and perfect service again !) had another round with clay who was sooo funny and helpful but told us no blue crabs because of weather :( guy who seated us could've given a heads up??? Anyway finished the round and just left... Will of course b back for more blues just make sure u call first to see if there's crabs available and no special events... Love u anyway crab corner.... Home sweet home!"}
{"text":"Every time we go there we get top notch food and service. They by far have the best crabs in the city. They have a wide variety of crabs and a full bar!"}
{"text":"As a Maryland native, I was very excited to hear about Crab Corner. The experience did not disappoint and felt like home. Crabs were fresh and the staff (including one of the owners) were extremely friendly and welcoming. The owner pointed out to us that about 3/4 of the restaurant was currently filled with other Maryland natives who had become regulars as well which is always a good sign.
Great deals like 2 for 2 Tuesdays ($2 female crabs/$2 beers) and 3 for 3 Thursdays ($3 male crabs/$3beers). They have plans to open up a new spot with an outdoor patio which I am really looking forward to checking out in the Fall.
Highly recommend trying this place out - I definitely plan on coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Our server AJ was amazing! He gave specific details about the food items and explained about the different taste! Will definitely recommend the Crab Corner and thanks again AJ for the warm welcome and the great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  They left out my order.  No apologies no discounts. Just ignored us. The snow crab had been precooked but was ok not great.  When they finally brought my order the rest of our group was almost done.  They still got it wrong and never even bothered to come back and check. I had ordered the sweet potato tots and they brought fries. When I finally got their attention they put in an order for the tots. It took forever to get it and I and the rest of our group was done when they arrived. They did not say a word just walked over on put them on the table. No apologies no explanation just rude service.  I had brought out of town family there and was embarrassed by my choice.  I will never return."}
{"text":"So far so good never had oysters but couldn't resist their happy hour lunch menu! Very friendly and accommodating. I could see coming here more"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner and I am stuffed. I grew up in Maryland and I miss it at times. Eating here gave me a little piece of home. The crab cakes were wonderful. I also had the \"boardwalk fries. They were cooked perfect. 
I also got the corn on the cob. It was just ok. But I didn't go there for the corn. 
The staff were very friendly and attended our every need. 
I will becoming back very soon."}
{"text":"I would normally not rate any place 5 stars on the first visit , but if you are the mood for some really good seafood this is the place. Went with co-workers for lunch and wishes we could wash it down with some beer bit we had to go back to work. Now the food started with oyster and very clean tasting !! Then the garlic plater crabs, shrimp that three of is split and we all had plenty to eat. The staff kept our drinks full and were a lot of fun very friendly. I'm looking forward to having dinner and many more lunches it's not cheep so remember you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Fab service, excellent meals, and a great relaxed setting.  
I love the wooden picnic tables and brown paper table \"cloth\", very authentic and convenient.   The crabs are oh so fresh and finger licking good. 
And great specials $2 Tuesdays regular blue crabs and domestic beers and $3 Thursdays medium male crabs and any beer
Best place to get crabs period."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay. I didn't like how the crab was seasoned. It seemed like they steamed the crab then add the seasoning after which beats the purpose. If you want real GREAT crab check out Crab Hut. They at least have bibs you can use so you don't get ur clothes dirty as your cracking the shells and their seasoning is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance and this spot has redeemed itself. I going to say the food we got was very good and the device was much better. Dollar oysters were tasty and the crabs were excellent.


I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My wife is from maryland and she went GAGA over this place it had surprisingly good catfish too!!"}
{"text":"As a Maryland native I was super duper excited to try this restaurant! The Maryland crab soup is soooo good. The crab cakes are good (not better than mine) and the crabs are yummy as well. A MUST try if you like seafood."}
{"text":"The place was a relatively small place. The customer service was great! I went sometime around 8 so decently close to closing. The servers were very friendly and were very helpful. It does take a while for the crab to come because they steam it once you order it which is a lot better.

I had a dozen female crabs and it was great! its very different from red lobster or any other crab that you would eat at a buffet. Its a lot more work to get the meat but it is well worth it. 

Definitely a place to try if you like to eat crab and dont mind a mess and work."}
{"text":"Came for their $2 Tuesday special and will def be back! Got shrimp, mussels, and 1 dozen Maryland crabs & beer... Domestic draft beers also were only $2 on Tuesday nights too, great special & service from Sam, Jessie, & Jeremy, was a lot of fun & just like home! Thx!! A+++ New Tuesday spot for sure..., check it out... Thx!"}
{"text":"Totally serviceable if you want average crab and oysters.  The service is good, the price is fair, the quality is so-so.  You get what you pay for.  Much better options in town if you're willing to spend just a few more dollars per person.  The happy hour has some generous discounts, so make sure to ask if you go."}
{"text":"came here with the girls and ordered:

female blue crabs - i order female because i love the orange stuff. organs. whatever it is. LOVE IT. couldn't really taste the seasoning because it's all on the outside which is fine, i like my crab with lime, salt & pepper anyway

spiced peel & eat shrimp -  half the size of the shrimp i got at hot and juicy on 2/14 and overcooked. decent flavor.. prob won't order again

fried oysters with corn and potato salad - i actually ordered corn and sweet potato fries but the server mixed up my friend and i's order. sides just ok, the oysters were nice, big n crunchy in a tempura like batter (not bread crumb)

5oz crabcake platter - my friend ordered this and she said it was just ok, not filling at $15.95 but it was mostly crabmeat not too much filler so maybe i'll try next time

we were still hungry (three girls) so we ordered 1 pound crawfish \"louisiana\" style. i'm from texas so i expected more garlic.. onion.. seasoning.. this was buttery and had some spice but definately needed more flavor.

more or less would come here again just for fried oysters and blue crab only"}
{"text":"Not happy at all with crab corner. This is the first time dined at this place and very disappointing. The oysters we so small the lemon wedge provided was larger. The service in order to get someone's attention needed to flap my hands like I am taking off crazy. The crab cake was good but everything else was very disappointing and over prided and had 8 crab sizes on wall but only had 1 size also when asked about the 2$ blue crab told not available only 3$ so we were stuck for price. Wife not happy for birthday choice and now everyone knows \" happy wife happy life\" not this time. Hope the manager and owners read this."}
{"text":"We came to Crab Corner tonight and it was not a pleasant experience.  
First of all, the items are quite over priced.  The 4 mini crab cakes for $10.99 were rediculous.   I think they were smaller than mimi.  

Second, the server was quite unprofessional and very unattentive.  I did not get a refill on my water or a check back on how things were.  Asked for the manager, we were told, \" he stepped out\". 

Being new and first time customers we were very disappointed.  It would've been nice if they offered to show us how to best eat a Maryland Crab.

 The meal I ordered looked like it could've been served at Long John Silvers and would've paid a whole lot less than $40.00."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always good. I had no complaints until this past Tuesday when I came for their daily special (that they happen to advertise pretty heavily and regularly on their website, Facebook and Twitter). When we get there, the guy tells us they didn't get that many crabs that day so there are no females and no special on the crabs. I thought that was fair, but assumed the drink specials ($2 Rolling Rock or PBR) would still be in effect... unless, God forbid, the availability of beer in the city suddenly drops overnight. Ended up being charged full price for the beer though so had to deduct a star.

But... like I said, food is solid and good vibes abound so I'll be back whenever the urge for Maryland style crabs hits me (which happens far too frequently)."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  We enjoyed the atmosphere, service AND the food.  We had chicken tenders w/ fries, oysters on the half shell and snow crab legs.  Each item was delicious.  Would definitely go back.  As an added bonus, it's right around the corner from our home.  Need to hit up their happy hour specials which vary from night to night."}
{"text":"Authentic blue crab prepared Maryland style with Old Bay Seasoning. My wife ordered the all you can eat crab and I ordered the pick two platter with fried oysters and fried cod. The food was delivered promptly. All of the seafood was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (who grew up in Baltimore), a friend, and I came here on our cross-country road trip from Baltimore back to LA. After eating crabcakes nearly every day for the week we were in Baltimore, we were eager to get one more hit of crab before we returned to crab-less Los Angeles. As you can imagine, we had high standards and we tempered our expectations, but we were really satisfied with these crabcakes and large sized bag o' steamed crabs. They were pretty damn good, and maybe the best we've had outside Maryland! I'll definitely be back... every time I come through Las Vegas again.

Extra points for serving Red Horse Beer! (the Filipino beer that's better than San Miguel)

FYI,  they no longer accept the 1 free crab with purchase of dozen yelp offer."}
{"text":"David is the best! We come here every Tuesday for $2 crab. Best service and fantastic food"}
{"text":"I frankly can't say enough about this place. Every time we have eaten here the staff is solicitous, the food is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. 

Some of the notable items, in my opinion:
The Catfish
The Cod
The Crab

And, I have to mention the Corn-on-the-Cob. Do they dip these in crack or what? Best I've ever had, to be honest. I could almost go here for that alone. Not that I ever would, since everything else is so good... 

You can't go wrong eating here...."}
{"text":"Tried Crab Corner on Eastern for the first time today. Wanted Blue Crab but they were out. Ordered a dozen oysters that looked like they were kidnapped. REALLY puny and sick looking. Ate a few, was disappointed and gave it back. Ordered a plate of crawfish. They were fat. But the seasoning was TERRIBLE. They were boiled and tasted like they were drowned in salt along with the same cajun seasoning i have in my cabinet. If possible, i would give this place negative stars. I will continue to kill my craving at Boiling Crab. Service was good though."}
{"text":"At first, I was expecting great customer service, like what everyone talks about. It took them a while to get us seated. One of the waiters FINALLY came to getbohr drinks after 15 minutes of sitting there. Apparently, a girl was supposed to get our drinks, but she wasn't doing her job. While we were waiting, we g I to survey the place. First of all there's only 2 waiters, and ONLY ONE us doing his job. Next, the food is not very good. We ordered 3 pounds of the maryland blue crab, and the size was so small, it's laughable. The crab was so bad, and they lied to us. I brang my kids along, and they didn't care to inform us that they steamed it with BEER. The maryland crab soup tastes like stale corn and a disgusting combonation of spices. Overall, the food was very salty and badly spiced. This whole experience was a nightmare of culinary spices."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at Crab corner and the food was beyond delicious, we will definitely be back for more very soon and the service was wonderful as well....I really enjoyed our server she had alot to say but really made us feel welcomed and comfortable, she was great, the whole atmosphere was just there, looks like we found our new favorite spot when we wanna eat, drink, talk and play....thanks Ashley, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Oh man if you like crab you have got to try this place... There crab was so big shell already cracked open. I go out to eat alot and I do not think I have tryed a better seafood place to this day!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the radio so my bf and I decided to try it out. We were really dissappointed with the appearance but thought maybe the food would be good. I was wrong. Calamari was overcooked and mostly breading, the crab didnt taste too good, and we didnt want to try anything past that. Some beers n wings added and it came out pretty expensive for bad food. Wont come here anymore"}
{"text":"For just the seafood, Crab Corner is pretty good.  I went twice, once for the fried softshell crab and then went back because I just had to try the crabcakes.  I also tried the Maryland crab soup and the bacon-wrapped scallops.  First, avoid the bacon-wrapped scallops!  They were horribly overcooked and therefore dry, tough, and except for the bacon, flavorless.  But the other three seafood items were terrific.  The crab in the crabcakes and soup tasted fresh, as opposed to frozen or out of a can.  If you have a craving for seafood (which tends to be either very bad or very expensive in the middle of the desert), Crab Corner is great.  But where this place really disappoints is everything else on the menu.  Every side I tried was just awful.  The corn on the cob had the taste and consistency of something that had been sitting in a warmer for hours, if not days.  The sweet potato tater tots are a great concept with weak execution.  And the hush puppies were either left in the fryer or sat in the warmer for so long that they were almost as tough as the scallops.  Finally, the dessert selection is almost nonexistent:  either snow cones (I tried the root beer - yuck) or Tasty Cakes (sounded very factory, so I didn't bother).  For seafood, Crab Corner gets 3 stars (the horrible bacon-wrapped scallops drops it a star).  But for everything else on the menu, it gets 1 star.  Both servers I had were great, so 4 stars for service.  I live pretty close, and as a Boston guy, I certainly love seafood, but I doubt I'll bother going back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been wanting to eat there. Walked in on a Friday afternoon and was greeted with a friendly voice. The food is good I like the seasoning the best of all the places that I've tried like this. I really like that they serve the shrimp with heads off . That in self worth going back for . The food is 41/2 stars. They need to have the nutcracker for the crab ti get meat out."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Maryland crab, then this is the place for you. And consider yourself warned to wear clothes you don't really care about. 

I'd like to suggest bibs and wet wipes on the table. Eating crabs is messy and there's only room for one in the restroom."}
{"text":"I had a craving for seafood but didn't want to pay $$$$ for it on the Strip or go to a buffet for less than prime pickings.  Luckily I checked Yelp and found this gem of a place!

I'm not sure if the guys running the place the night I went were the owners.  Regardless, they were really friendly and took a lot of pride in knowing their business and informing their customers.  This place is a no-frills, get down to business kinda place.

I know the whole crabs are the stars here, but I ordered the Alaskan King crab legs.  And it sure did hit the spot!  The pricing seems to be on par to The Crab Pot, at least for the similar order.  The lobster bisque was a bit salty, but still delicious.

I'm glad we took a risk to drive away from Las Vegas Blvd. and try this place out.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am may be picky but I can tear apart a blue crab like nobody's business. 

I consider myself an expert in this area as I grew up around the Baltimore, MD area - home of the Blue Crab if you ask anyone who knows anything about how to get it done.

I told one of the owners, John, that wouldn't it just figure that 3 weeks before I am leaving Las Vegas....I would find Blue Crabs after 20 years. I actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here. I am not even kidding - but then John offered to ship the crabs to D.I.A. for me and I decided to stick to my plan to move to Denver.

But I digress (as usual)....this place is LEGIT. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT if you ask me. I went with my dad, who is in town from the MD area, I knew that he would be the one to experience Crab Corner with me. We already knew that we were set on splitting an order of #2 males. But what else to get....BOARDWALK FRIES? Stop it right now. As I bit into the fry, I was immediately taken back to Ocean City, MD. And then the crabs came that were SO fresh and prepared perfectly with Old Bay sprinkled all over their bodies. 

H-E-A-V-E-N.

And then I just read below that Utz Potato Chips are on the way. All I can say about that is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I already have 2 dates set to go back and visit the Crab Corner before my departure from Vegas on January 8 and you better believe that every time I come into town to visit, this will be on my list of Top Stops. 

Thank you, Crab Corner, for bringing a little piece of my hometown to my homeplace, Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! If you are looking for a great neighborhood hangout where the food is outstanding and everyone treats you like family this is the place to be. They have great specials the seafood is fresh and the beer is cold. So roll up your sleeves and dig in."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with the menu.  The seafood quality is below average for the price.  I'm not knocking them down. Hopefully they read this review and look into what they working with.  I'm not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I found a roach in my food .. I'm sure it fell from.the ceiling but they chose to say I brought it in ... why the he'll would I bring in a roach .. smh !!! Worst experience ever .. they even called the cops on me .. I will never go back again .. I hope it shuts down .. they are not clean ..."}
{"text":"Being from Maryland and have meet this guys I will never order crabs from then again.  Jumbo crab 10 out of 12 mush"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place again. The food was less than desirable. The bar ran out of triple sec, but offered to sell me a margarita at a higher price because they were going to use grand mariner in place of triple sec. Never again!"}
{"text":"Finally had dinner at this place last night..... our review very impressed the food was phenomenal. I had the crab cake  with 2 sides homemade potato salad marvelous just like grandma makes and the garlic green beans amazing. Every bite full of flavor. The Hubby had the shipwreck Po'boy sandwich with the boardwalk fries the oysters, shrimp and catfish fried to perfection. Delicious! The service was outstanding, the staff very friendly and helpful with recommendations."}
{"text":"Here with my family, staying in Las Vegas. Went here cause we found a groupon deal, thought it was gonna be good! I was wrong! I ordered the soft shell crab platter that comes with 2 sides of choice, for $21.99 !! I thought i was gonna get some large soft shell crab! They were only about 3 inches long, each. 3 of themm No taste, if not any at all. Im from the state of Washington, so i know my seafood. This did not taste like any crab ive ever had! Was highly dissapointed!"}
{"text":"New to Vegas i didn't know any local restaurants, and couldn't afford to eat out anyways. I had a date with this one guy who offered to take me for  the best lobster in town. we pulled into this strip mall next to a Red Lobster, i started to laugh. Red Lobster is a \"high end\" fast food joint, far from BEST anything. then he pointed to the opposite corner of the mall, to this little hole in the wall. 

As i'm a foodie, and am a great seafood lover, i will ALWAYS try a new restaurant (especially if someone else is paying). as we walk in, and i see this place, little more than a school cafeteria in decoration, rolls of paper towels on the table, plastic table cloths over wooden picnic tables, i was wondering what kind of place did this guy bring me to? but i now realize the kitsch of the decoration, is part of the charm of this place, decorating (or lack there of) is a way to make EVERYONE feel at home, and not to detract from the taste of the food. 

We ordered the king crab legs and the lobster (what can i tell you, i have expensive tastes) however, the pricing was fairly reasonable. this was my first time having king crab, and even though i had a difficult time cracking those suckers, it was worth every minute. the lobster was the most tender i have ever had. being from Canada (Ontario, NOT the maritimes) i had never had hush-puppies, and personally probably won't have them again, they were OK, but a little too bland for my taste, reminded me a bit of falafel which i'm also not a fan of. 

Several months later when my mother was in town visiting me for my birthday, i brought her here, the look of skepticism on her face probably mimicked mine when i first came here, but she trusted me, because she knows how i am when it comes to food, if i recommend a place there's a reason for it. we ordered the lobster dip appetizer (AMAZING!) and again the lobster and king crab. unfortunately they were short on crackers, so we had to share one, not happy about this (they need to restock and have a surplus of these things, only downside of this place that i've seen so far), but the lobster and crab was even better than i remembered, my mother who has traveled the world over, has had lobster in Maine, Newfoundland, and other states and provinces in the east, and she was ready to order a second lobster (which we actually did). this time for the sides i ordered the sweet potato tots (i even ordered some to go after the second lobster, because they were so good), all in all, the 2 lobsters, an order of king crab legs and lobster appetizer came to $86, that is a DAMN good price. the next day, when my mother was back in Toronto, she called me up asking if she could fly in once a month just for the day, just to eat at the Crab Corner, and considering my mother doesn't like ANYTHING, that is one hell of an endorsement."}
{"text":"We came here for lent, it was about 2;30 and empty , bad sign i thought.     Well it did not stay empty for long.
           We had the crab dip on burchetta the special that day and the lobster bisque another special. The crab dip was really good ,very generous with the crab.  The lobster bisque was ok, not much lobster flavor. We ordered the  dozen large crabs .  The crabs were ok, not much seasoning on the crabs like i had in maryland..Kinda spendy.  I will be back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Epic. Just go here. Spend a few extra bucks and get the bigger crabs. The small ones are a lot of work for almost no meat. Really messy. Your hands smell like the ocean for days, hehe. Get the boardwalk fries for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  It definitely reminds me of summer crab feasts from growing up in Delaware and living in DC for seven years; a perfect place for transplant parents to take a visiting son.  The crabs are great, even if they aren't using Old Bay seasoning, the shrimp is terrific, the sides aren't bad either, and the service is just as good as the seafood."}
{"text":"Great seafood, great drinks and Ashely may be the world's greatest bar tender. \"A\" class service."}
{"text":"When we pulled up in front of this place my first thought was it was a hole in the wall and I wasn't sure we should go in. Boy was I surprised! The service was excellent and the food was even better! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes seafood. They only serve beer & wine but that wasn't a problem for us. Give it a try and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"}
{"text":"I came to Crab Corner after seeing all the awesome reviews on Yelp, made a special trip out here just for the restaurant to try the clams and blue crab on the happy hour menu. 

The manager came up to me and said that he couldn't serve the blue crab on the happy hour but I could buy the one for $11.99 lb instead. THIS WAS A NEW RULE THAT JUST STARTED TODAY, so yesterday they served the blue crab at happy hour... So I asked why he couldn't serve the happy hour blue crab and he said because it's too expensive for them to let customers order from the happy hour menu. So I asked why it was on the menu with a price if he didn't want to serve it at that price and why \"market price or it changes\"  wasn't written there and his solution was to remove the menu from the table and said \"that's how to fix that\"  but you can buy the entree crab... 

As an establishment the restaurant creates the price for each item, and they just decided that they didn't want to serve it for that price without changing the menu or anything.

THE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIS SERVERS ABOUT THIS NEW RULE UNTIL AFTER I ALREADY ORDERED MY DISH

The waitress was very nice but it didn't make up for the managers incompetence. They should just take it off the menu or serve the dish. 

P.s the bread with the clams is just a hamburger bun and the clams were whatever...  This was a waste of a $20 uber ride i just feel bad for the waitress who has to work here."}
{"text":"Loved the dining experience, the atmosphere and the crab legs.  Yum.  We were fortunate to sit next to a really nice couple who were kind enough to give a tutorial on how to eat a steamed crab.  The employees were super nice and helpful.  I was impressed at the diversity of people."}
{"text":"As a former Marylanders.   We grew up on these crabs.  I've been transplanted in Vegas for 15 years.  And with every visit to Maryland have to find some blue crabs.  Thank god someone made them available here.  

First off.  These are the real deal.  They are cooked on old bay seasoning ( which every crab lover knows is the ONLY way to cook crabs. The place reminded me of a crab house on the water back in Maryland.  Complete with brown paper on the table. and rolling rock beer.  Yum yum 

Only have two knocks on the place. 

1.  Dropped 200 bucks here.  Two couples eating crabs and beer.  That's pretty steep. 

2.  Guys get some friggin metal butter knives so the people from the east coast that really know how to eat crabs can eat without pounding the shit out of the crabs with those damn hammers. 


Good meal may have been pricey but I didn't have to go 3000 miles to get them"}
{"text":"We decided to dine here last night because:  1) we were in the vicinity 2) wanted something quick without going to a fast food joint and 3) it's a friday during lent season.

We ordered the boardwalk style fries, bowl of lobster bisque, 1/3 lb. crab cake sandwich and a fried oyster sandwich. I didn't love the fries and thought it was okay. Only after we left and I looked at the menu again did I realize that you are supposed to season them with crab spice and vinegar. Oh well...I will definitely try the crab spice seasoning next time but I'm no fan of malt vinegar so I don't know if that'll make a difference. We shared a bowl of lobster bisque which was very tasty but I thought it would be better if I found actual pieces of lobster in the lobster bisque. Afterall, the bowl wasn't cheap at $8 a bowl. My husband devoured his fried oyster sandwich which he claims was very good. It was served on a bun with lettuce, tomato and cocktail sauce. The crab cake sandwich also came on a bun with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. The crab cake was delicious and full of crab meat and little filler if any.

I rated it a 4 star because based on what we ate, we are a fan and plan on coming back to try the rest of the menu and more specifically the blue crab. Although the food is a bit pricey, you do get what you pay for. The staff was pleasant and observed them helping out new diners crack open some crab. The atmosphere here is quite casual and laid back. A great place to watch some sports on tv and enjoy good food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have expected to find good Maryland seafood in the heart of Las Vegas, but this place is definitely worth stopping by for lunch or dinner.

Prices are reasonable and the food is served quickly. Highly recommended. I've been back several times, and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was the worst I have ever had $72 for our food that was not even that good. Had to keep asking for our drinks."}
{"text":"You get  fresh carb. You get what you pay for.  These hard shell blue crab is a lot of work.  Which I don't mind at all. I would hope that the spices and flavor would be in the crab not just in the outer shell."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overpriced and overrated. I just move to Las Vegas and was in search of some seafood. I'm from Florida so seafood can be gotten at our fingertips and at a reasonable price. I ordered the pick two and got the fried oysters and shrimp, as well as the potato salad and and corn and I also got a cup of lobster bisque. I asked the server what kind of oysters did he have and he told me he had no clue and did not even try to go see what kind. I got the shrimp and I could tell they were not fresh. I say this because I asked the guy if they were and he said they were. The oysters were the huge pacific oysters and those are not ideal for frying in my book. 

lobster bisque: had a good taste but I took it back into the restaurant because I expected chunks of lobster and simply got nothing but little shredded pieces. After I finished it I could have sworn I tasted crab. 

potato salad: I think I tasted celery. I took one bit and did not finished. Lacked salt. Very bland.

corn: average, had a bit of seasoning on it.

shrimp: average tasting, but I could have went to a fast food restaurant for the quality AND taste.

oysters: I HATE pacific oysters, but I decided to give them a chance anyway in fairness. I ate one and threw away the rest. 

All in all, a waste of money. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fuck. This. Place.

I bought two Amazon Local gift certificates to use here. The first visit, we weren't brought any silverware or condiments. After five minutes of our food sitting getting cold, I had to walk up to the server station and fetch them myself. No one refilled our drinks the entire time. The signature crab stew was bitter and nasty. The steamed blue crabs are a ridiculous ripoff. What little meat they contain sticks to the shell and shreds apart making it maddeningly impossible to eat.

After that lovely meal, we still had another gift certificate so we gave them another chance. This time we were looking to sample the crab cakes. After not being greeted by the hostess and having to initiate contact, we finally were seated. And there we sat, ignored, for 35 minutes before the jackass waiter approached our table. With no eye contact, the first words out of his mouth were, \"So you ready?\" We stood up and walked out."}

{"text":"Moving to Vegas, I never thought I'd get a \"taste\" of Maryland again, unless I were to fly back.
This place FEELS like Maryland. All the games, all the food. If you have never had the opportunity to have crabs the true Maryland way, stop in and get messy!!!"}
{"text":"For lenten season we decided to go for seafood meal and decided to try Crab Corner last night.  Looking at the menu, we just ordered the pick two combo and a side to go with it for the reason I am not really into crabs, mussells, oysters etc. So far we had crab cake with fries and shrimp, chicken tender with coleslaw. Overall, the highlights was the crab which was my first time tasting it and it was good. The rest are just a mediocre taste that you can get it at Long Silver's for lower price. We paid $40 for two combo with soda. It was kinda expensive for me to be honest because the taste was just okay. Other than that, the manager was really attentive and always checked our table."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Jared provided the BEST customer service...my son & I had the all you can eat crabs (on Mondays) and we reminisced about our past 10 years in Maryland as we are.  We ate  so much crab that we couldn't feel our lips (lol). That's when Jared suggested the snow cone (it's a Baltimore thing) and WE LOVED IT!!! Jared's recommendation helped us to get feeling back to our poor little lips...will be visiting again SOON...you should too!!!"}
{"text":"Finding Crab Corner was treat and a nice surprise. Very good Maryland crabs and the feel off a Maryland Crab house. Good food and good service. $$ enjoy I am telling all of my friends who love Las Vegas and crabs. Glad to be off the Strip!"}
{"text":"So much to say...so many dislikes.  Service terrible, strip mall awful, picnic style tables awful.  Item missing from order, asked for it, still never got it and had to ask to remove from bill.  Soft shell crab greasy.  Female blue crab, no meat, too much work for no meat.  Crab soup 99% lima beans with no flavor.  Would not recommend nor return. I wouldn't even give 1 Star but the system makes you give at least one."}
{"text":"Have you ever tried there Lobster Bisque? There cups are bowl size compaired to Monstah Lobstah & 10 X better! After trying a cup with there crab cakes (which are the best in town so far) I ended up ordering a bowl of Lobster Bisque. I was just curious about the place and it looks like it's going to be a new regular place for the wife and I."}
{"text":"Placed a order from Crab Corner.  I order the large shrimp!!!! WELL IF THE SHRIMP WERE LARGE THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ORDER.  The shrimp look they were cut from a larger shrimp each shrimp were about the of my index finger. Beer Batter did'nt have that enjoyable taste I.usually enjoy it was..so..so. Will not order this it again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I purchased a Groupon and glad I did. I am allergic to seafood and had the pulled pork.  I told the waiter of my allergy and he didnt blow me off. My daughter had the Alaskan crab and fell in love first bite. We are from the east coast and this place hits it on the head. My daughter could not stop talking about how good her crab was.  She wants to come back tomorrow.  The staff is very friendly. They came by the table checking to see if you need anything. It was good to see they didn't seat you then forget about you. I can see why this place was packed when we walked in. I had heard if this place before coming and once I saw the Groupon I jumped on the deal. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We loved crab corner.  There were 4 adults and 2 kids with our party.  We ordered two large sampler platters and a coupe appetizers- mini crab cakes and calamari.  We ate family style and there was plenty to go around.  They covered the table with brown paper and gave us all bibs and wooden mallets.  Seafood is super fresh and tastes wonderful.  Staff is very knowledgeable about the menu.  Highly recommend trying this off strip restaurant if you live in Vegas or are just visiting."}
{"text":"I have to tell you, this was outstanding.  The crabs were cooked PERFECTLY, the crawfish were tasty (though cooked differently than what my wife and I are accostomed to) and the crab cake was good as well.  They put butcher paper down on the table and we were ready to go!  Service was friendly and helpful and answered my wife's questions about where they get the crawfish from throughout the year.  The place is very casual and bright.  The only let down was they were out of hush puppies, which we wanted to try.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You need to know right now that my Wife grew up on the Atlantic Ocean very near the Chesapeake Bay. Her family were all Watermen. They fished and raked both clams and oysters. Just what do you think she ate every day of her life? Right, seafood. Ok, me too.

Crab Corner food is what I remember from my Maryland and Virginia peninsula days. It is absolutely authentically prepared each day with 'flown in overnight\" fresh seafood.

Our meal last night (Monday) :

Appetizer  -  Calamari.     Fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating. This offering is cooked quickly. The crispy coating is light, brown and in place. The squid inside is hot, tender and clean tasting. Remember, if you cook squid over a minute you get rubber, These folks know how to do it.

Soup:   -   Cream of Crab.     Hot, creamy succulent, and filled with blue crab meat. This is something Libby's Grandma would make.

Entree   -   Crab Cake Platter.     Let's start with the fact that these huge cakes are nothing but blue crab. There are NO FILLERS. They use a very light bit of coating and then broil them. Nothing but taste here. Excellent menu item. Comes with two cakes and two sides.

Entree   -   Soft - Shell Crab Platter.     The best you can get. They have a number of sizes. the three we had were called Chesapeake Bay, MD \"Prime Size\". Crunchy, sweet and juicy. Very \"home style Maryland\".

Sides   -   Don't bother to fool with the regular old frozen fried. Pay the extra $1.00 for the wonderful Boardwalk Fries. These are hand cut and fried in peanut oil with a hint of crab spices. Then you make them swim in some great malt vinegar. Just like on the Boardwalk in Ocean City Maryland. I can almost smell the salt are as I eat them.
Mimi's Potato Salad is the home made style that is uses by Mom's and Grandma's all around the Chesapeake Bay. Seriously flavorful, rich, and creamy. The Cole slaw is creamy and filled with that course slaw you want. The texture and flavor is right there.

Drinks   -   Iced Tea was fresh made, cold, and clean tasting. A fine thirst quencher.

We had no room for desert. I think for my next trip in I will start my meal with a Baltimore Shaved Ice \"Snowball\" with about a dozen flavors to choose from. My Wife did manage to get out the door with two packs of Tasty Cakes. (that's a comfort food from MD)

The menu is extensive. It is going to take us a while to try everything. You see above what we had on this first trip in. Go on line (CrabornerLV.com) and take a look at their menu. It is extensive. 

Their claim to fame is the \"flown in daily\" Maryland Blue Crabs. They are steamed with Crab Blend Seasoning and the dumped on your table. You just use your mallet and pick to bring that sweet crab meat right on to your taste buds.

My next meal is going to be fresh single fried oysters and a bunch of steamed hard shell blue crabs.

For the quality, quantity, cooking, and freshness of what you get at the Crab Corner the cost is very reasonable.

You want a great east coast seafood meal? This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Service here was a total nightmare.  I'm pretty sure management is comprised of a herd of cats because everything was chaos.

Although I was seated at a table, and had food brought to me, I still have no idea who my server was.  There was a guy with an iPhone that took our order...but mysteriously disappeared.  Then the bartender ended up taking our order after we had to ask for our order to be taken.  Just, service misery. Keep dreamin' if you want water refilled.  The whole meal was spent tracking down employees to perform basic tasks. 

Food was okay (blue crab, lobster roll, nothing special) and the restaurant was clean -- the only things saving this place from 1 star.  Not worth it, however, to endure round 2 of this service mess."}
{"text":"Just got my softshell fix. Yum!!! And friendly service too. Great place!"}
{"text":"My GF took me here today for the brunch special. She purchased the bottomless drink special through group on. To start, our waiter Richard was very helpful and patient with us. We had a ton of questions and he took his time to answer all of them graciously.  Now to get to the food... The lobster bisque was AMAZING! Honestly one of the best ive had in a restaurant. Then we ordered the garlic steamer sampler. Also and amazing meal! Definitely not a meal for two, more like 3 or 4. The crab was very delicious and full of flavor! Last but not least the bottomless drinks.... a choice of Bloody Mary, Mimosa, and Sangria. I had the pleasure of trying all three and all three were on point! Seriously I dont want to under sell the quality of these drinks. All were made very well and poured with a heavy hand ;-) I will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"we came on Thursday night coz they have special free beer when u text Crab .Four of us ,first timer here, We able to use groupon with no problem, our server I forgot her name she's a sweet, friendly ,asian girl. She gave us free beer after texting /answerinh trivia.They gave us free cheese for my Aunt who celebrates her 61st bday.Thumbs up!great place ,good choice for groupon friends."}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem like it would have such fresh delicious crab but its does! My husband and I can't stop eating there and the servers are nice. I like the casual atmosphere as well. Blue crab is the best!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review ever... and lemme tell you! This place was pretty awesome!

My husband and I had the sampler -- 1 lb of Maryland crab, 1 lb of Dungeness crab, 1 lb of king crab, 1/2 of shrimp and corn on the cob, plus we had their crab soup (cream-based). We finished every bit of it! Really, really good! 

The staff were all attentive and friendly... especially Jade. She's the cutest thing ever!

My husband have promised each other to stop in here every time we drive in from San Diego before we visit our family here in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was perfect and authentic. We weren't up for picking crabs this evening, but enjoyed the lump crab cake -made Maryland-style."}
{"text":"Excellent food !Great service! Not fast food if your in a hurry not the place to come. For a enjoyable meal made fresh this is a great choice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Who ever thought of fast food style high quality seafood was a good idea was an absolute GENIUS.  Crab corner serves up better food than most seafood joints that use cloth napkins."}
{"text":"I experienced the worst service from jared this guy completly rushed me and my guest to order..... It was my grandmother's birthday and this guy jared destroyed it with his horrible service & remarks.....at this time jared advised us if we wanted to complain more to take it up with the owner john! Wow i would never have a clown working at my establishment.... He needs to be drug tested for sure! At this time i asked to speak with a manager on duty and he continued to use abusive language towards me & my wife.... We decided to leave and have our family go yo red lobster!"}
{"text":"We went to lunch there because we had a Groupon. Seemed like a good and inexpensive way to check it out. We're in love! We both ordered po-boy sandwiches - I had the catfish and my friend had the fried shrimp. We also shared an appetizer. The food was excellent, price was right and service was superb.
So we went back to treat a friend on her birthday. The food was still superb and reasonable but the service was only so-so. A nice young man named Jared seemed to be busy but I don't know with what. We went late so they weren't crowded. Still I was done with my lunch by the time he asked if I wanted more tea. We were obviously there for a special occasion (wrapped presents, decorated cupcakes, etc.) and most restaurants would have taken note of that. My friend who walks with difficulty was not treated with deference (pulling out chair, taking care of her cane, etc.) Young people don't care if you can walk, just so you can pay.
I'm writing all this in hopes that management actually reads their reviews because I want them to improve and then stay around for a long time. I could eat the crab dip on baguettes every day of my life."}
{"text":"Lunch or Dinner, place to be right now for their killer Beer battered Shrimp with side of Old Bay Chips. Beautiful afternoon for a take out as well. Did I mention the superb service with?!"}
{"text":"This place have great service and I would recommend this place to any body who likes blue crab."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant. Great food and service. I found this restaurant while searching the internet for seafood in las Vegas. The food was absolutely the best. There were locals there so I was pretty sure the food was gonna fantastic and I was right. Great discovery."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!  Visited on a Thursday night.  Server had no idea of their happy hour specials.  She was the only person (it seemed) to be working the floor.  She was cleaning tables in between bringing food orders out.  Waited and waited for her to come over
to take our order.  Finally decided to leave after waiting over 15 minutes for her.  I felt like I was on one of those \"reality tv shows\"... We dine out a lot....and this was one of the most horrible places I've ever visited. Had a bad fishy smell too.   Would give zero stars if I could.  Don't waist your time.  UGH!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now, finally made it! I must say I was disappointed with the food. The service was good, very energetic & fun server/bartender. However, the food was all just mediocre. There wasn't a lot of flavor in anything we tried, & we tried a lot. My group was all in agreement, we won't be going back. Like I said, the food wasn't BAD, just not good either."}
{"text":"Went in during a lunch rush on a weekday.  Specifically came in to try out their soft shell crab po' boys.  They were kind of busy and it seemed a bit undermanned at the time, so suffice it to say, the sandwiches weren't that good.  Crab was left in the fryer a bit too long and tasted slightly burned.  Service was okay.  Sweet potato fries and calamari were good, though.  I suppose the search continues in the valley for a proper soft shell crab po' boy."}
{"text":"Not such great crab cakes. Who serves tartar sauce instead of remoulade with crab cakes? Not a place that is serious about their crab cakes. I've eaten crab cakes up and down the Atlantic coast, including Maryland, and these were a big disappointment.  They were okay only, not anywhere near great. Certainly edible, but you'll get better ones at most any decent restaurant. I'm such a fan of crab cakes that if they're on the menu, even in Michigan or Nashville, I'll order them.  And I've had some great ones in both of those locations. Not here.
However, I'm not giving up on this place until I try the lobster. But crab cakes, which are the hallmark of Maryland food, don't bother."}
{"text":"First time here and omg this place is amazing!! Happy hour has $1 oysters and they were so good. I inhaled a dozen right away. Sam was our bartender and everything he recommended was great. I'll definitely be back here- A LOT!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The crab cakes were great as was the crab! The service here was amazing and the owner was the nicest guy! I will definitely eat here again and again."}
{"text":"I was craving MD style crab cakes and this place delivered soundly. Only the slightest amount of  bread crumbs were used to hold the cake together, perfectly seasoned, good portion size. Hush puppy sides were light, crunchy & delicious. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the cost was a little pricey  - $32 for one crab cake, hush puppies and cup of soup."}
{"text":"1st off, customer service was not very good, from the girl who sat us down to our waiter. Our waiter not once asked if we needed a refill or anything. It was like as if he was in hiding. Food was super delicious, so much props to the chef. Place was a bit pricey for what u actually get. The seasoning for the crablegs was amazingly delicious!!! Will only come back to purchase the seasoning."}
{"text":"I went to college in Maryland so while on a work trip to Vegas, I felt it was only right to get crabs. Crab Corner is chock full of Terps and Ravens memorabilia plus a pretty awesome crab tank in the middle of the place. Surprised there was no Redskins stuff but then again that team is terrible. overall the place is really large which would be good if I had a party. I did not so I sat at the bar.

The server was attentive and since it was a work trip I decided to splurge with a little of everything. First up raw oysters. While not for everyone I am a big fan and these did not disappoint. The shell is pretty deep so it was like a bowl of oyster. Next up was the bacon wrapped scallops. They were super hot so it needed a good cut in the middle and some the apricot sauce it comes with. It's bacon and scallops so you know it's amazing.

For my meal I ordered a five large crabs. Tons of meat with a good spice on top of it. Not old bay but something similar. By time I was pretty full but enjoyed the meal. I will definitely be back again the next time in Vegas and hopefully with a group."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. My man and I have been regulars here now for about 2 months. The only reason we came is because after getting back from San Diego we were on a mission to find good oysters out here. Crab corner delivered. To top it off during happy hour they are only a dollar! :D we rarely stray from our regular order which is oysters, lobster bisque, peel and eat shrimp and sometimes hush puppies. Everything is ALWAYS delicious and fresh. The only down fall is I am not a huge fan of their beer selection and one of the new bar tenders is a little wierd. Other than that no complaints. And we will always be back: D"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Find a buffet it will be cheaper and probably better quality. The only redeeming factor for this place is the staff. Very friendly, quick, and helpful. Spent almost $70 for 2 people on tiny plates of fish and shrimp. Maybe 8 shrimp and 2 small pieces of fish. The sides were bland (potato salad). And we didn't even order drinks."}
{"text":"Found this place via a groupon. What a nice find . Real Maryland style crab fair ! Had the soft shell crab sandwich , delicious even out of season.. And the crab Benedict which was perfect from hollandaise to egg texture. 


Migrated to bar to continue our bottomless deal (if you don't have a bottomless for brunch ... What you doing ??)) met Ashley the bartender. She was so attentive and relatable . Would come back to see her and eat at the bar Area ."}
{"text":"Excellent crab cakes .. not that familiar with Maryland style crab and unfortunately already sold out of blue crab today, so snow crab was the choice ..very sweet and tasty with simple butter dip.  Really like the Virginia oysters on the half shell .. overall really good food, definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The only real Maryland style crab in town.....really really good!!!
Real Thrasher style fries...
Really good soft shells...
Even better hard shells..."}
{"text":"Great food...get in there and work those crabs! They have specials that get broadcasted via facebook, down-right Maryland roots....crabs and football!"}
{"text":"I love eating snow crab, king crab, dungeness crab, lobster and almost anything that lives under the water. Personally I could not stomach the blue crab they served. It might be a case of needing to be familiar with it or it might have been their preparation all i know is it's not for me. After trying some of the blue crab I asked for their snow crab which all I can say is Yawn... I personally see no reason to go back.."}
{"text":"The place is comfortable but we saw very few customers there even at its peak hour. So that means no wait which is a plus. Overpriced menu. The groupon drink of $15 for a glass of alcohol mix is quite a joke. It tastes no better than a pre-mixed Costco type of drink. The service is fair, not great but not horrible. The food is good but way too expensive as it comes to a small tiny portion. Two order of crab cakes cost almost $28 but it is just like an appetizer. If your budget is less than $40-$50 per person, this is not a place for you. It all explained why this restaurant is quite empty and not sure if it is in business for long if they still keep the cost of their food that high. This is not the Strip to charge that premium price."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, comfortable atmosphere, and make sure you sit by the bar; Ashley is the best!!!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for quite a while and finally headed over there tonight. Ordered drinks and took some time to review the menu. Settled on 2 combo plates; shrimp & clams and cod and clams. Side dishes were onion rings, French fries and dinner salads. The salads were fresh and actually pretty good. Everything else we ordered was fried which may be where we went wrong. The cod was oil soaked, shrimp was edible but dense in a strange kind of way and the clams had a rubber band texture. The French fries were pretty good. Service was acceptable but I am pretty much convinced if you are not going for the actual crab fest, go elsewhere. I did see a few other diners hitting crab platters pretty hard and looking happy."}
{"text":"i ordered steamed crabs on the 4th -they were large and heavy with crab meat inside. steamed to md perfection. born and lived in bmore on blue crabs, i must say these crabs were absolutely fantastic, will be back.great customer service also -great job
guys."}
{"text":"We have visited CC for a few years, we are in LV 3-4 times a year and the Eastern location has always been great. This is our second time to the new place. 
We know the food will be good and consistent in quality. The servings are fair, always tastes fresh and a good value for the price. 
We have become used to be treated like weekly regulars at Eastern, being recognized and acknowledged by staff even only visiting every 3-4months. The same treatment was received at the SW location on our first visit. Last night our service was poor at best. The young man was inattentive and ignored us for the majority of time we were there. The rest of the wait staff were not interested in covering for one another, walking by numerous times without inquiring about our needs. The waiter wanted to blame the poor service on \"busy\", not really for a Friday evening and being shorthanded, not really. I think there was no manager on duty....
Great food, poor service. We can find that many places. We will visit Eastern next time, hope the experience improves, or find a new place..... Really bums me out....."}
{"text":"The food and service are outstanding!! My first time here today....and will definitely be back as a regular! I highly recommend CRAB CORNER :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by talking about the whole \"the server was on his phone the whole time he was taking our order!\" comment in one of the reviews a women left. 

If you didn't already know, their cell phones have an operating program that's connected to their computers & printers; therefore, instead of writing it down they use their phones & once they hit send it goes straight to the kitchen's printer. Not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way, but I guess that's just how they do things here & I have no problem with that.

Let's move on, the food I absolutely love! I am a seafood fanatic & this place is one of my favorite places to go. They give you good portions especially for their snow crab legs. The only problem I have is that they charge an outrageous amount for a half a pound of shrimp. I think it was either $8.99 or $9.99. Personally I can go somewhere else for cheaper shrimp that tastes the same, but I still sometimes come here anyway.

Apparently the service is hit or miss, but I never have bad service when I go there. But they are right about one thing, water refills.."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews I'm reading about quality of the food & service. It was my first time there and I must've ordered the amazing foods only!
Well to start the server, I forget her name, but she was amazing and super helpful. Another server, a guy who was just going around refilling drinks was also great. And some other(can you tell I'm horrible with names?) I think he was bald, also had a great attitude. So I am shocked to hear about 'bad service' in some reviews. 
I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich- which I loved. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it but it was sooo tasty . My husband had the po'boy with all 3 fish options and he loved it. My mom ordered the two crab cake entree and it was so UH-MaZING!!!! This is officially one of our new favorite spots!!! Only reason I took off a star was because it was kind of warm inside the restaurant. But other than that I'll be back!!

** UPDATE: I should've added that traffic in the restaurant was also pretty busy, we came in right before happy hour I think. And still, great service"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a place that serves blue crabs! I went for $2 Tuesdays or regular females and they were very delicious, but next time I will get order some bigger crabs so I don't have to work as hard.  I forgot the spice that they use - it's not Old Bay but it's pretty similar.

I also ordered some oysters which were really fresh and sweet.  The hush puppies were brilliant - perfectly fried and moist inside. I liked the fried shrimp a lot but I didn't care much for the fried clams because I thought they were a little too chewy."}
{"text":"Craving some East Coast crab in Las Vegas and came across this place. Thumbs up! They really have little neck clams too."}
{"text":"Went here alone had a great time ordered crabs and more! Great conversations with people around bar area. Nothing like fresh crabs wish i was back in VA!"}
{"text":"Have heard a lot of good things about this place and noticed this location on our way out of town. We decided we would stop here on our way back in last night, which we did. We figured it would have been a nice unwind. Enjoy some delicious sea food, have a cold beer and try out someplace new.

When we arrived they had a live band inside and the music was way to loud, I requested a table as far away as possible because I did not want that to ruin the evening. Even being in the back of the place I could hardly have a conversation without speaking much to loud just to communicate. It was rather annoying. The band was decent but no reason for that type of volume in such a small place.

Our server was very nice, respectful and answered all of our questions without issue, I believe his name was Jim. We ordered black muscles, crab legs, cream of crab soup, lobster bisque, and crab cakes. It was all ok, but nothing special or even close to raving about, which confuses me about all these previous reviews. I am assuming they have been limited on their seafood intake as far as quality, or we just had the unfortunate night of a new cook. I would call this place a mini Joes Crab shack.

The person I ate with ended up not feeling good around the time we left. We all shared the same thing except the lobster bisque, she spent the remainder of her night with food poisoning and all the lovely symptoms it comes with as we got home.

We tried it, wont be back."}
{"text":"Had SUCH high hopes for eating here.. Sad to say, probably won't be coming back. If I'm going to spend 12.00 for crab dip, I want a bowl of it, not some placed on a baguette. My friend and I spent 60.00 for the two of us. Service was less than spectacular. 6.00 for a shock top? I can buy a 6-pack for 8, where's the value in that? Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had the garlic steamer and it was one of the best, fried oysters were to die for!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great dinner we had tonight. The service was excellent thanks to Chillie our server. The food is superior and freshly made to order. Oysters on the half shell were the best I have had in a very long time. The soft shell crabs were great and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is casual so you can come as you are. If you are looking for great food and service, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Besides the 30 minute wait...it was a fun environment!  Tuesday was $2.00 Steam Crab for females and regular male crab.  Price was great and service was definitely fun.  The only thing was I order corn and they were so busy turning over tables they forgot to get me my corn.  But would definitely go back again and perhaps with a larger group.  Just anticipate to wait a but longer.  =)"}

{"text":"Very good , had a GREAT beer that bartended recommended food was good, very good flovor"}
{"text":"so i boycotted this location the last time i went because the new people who worked there were jerks.  i ordered a bunch of crabs after my first order, and they forgot to put the order in.  i sat there waiting literally in excess of an hour, then realized that they didn't put the order in because everyone else was getting their orders, and asked for the second batch to go since i had to be at a poker tournament.  i finished my first order, btw.  they wouldn't do it - \"can't take them to go\".  wait, i just sat there wasting an hour of my time, and now *i'm* being unreasonable?  no apology either for forgetting my order.  to top it off, after telling these new twits that i'm a regular, one had the nerve to say \"i've never seen you here before\".  right, because you just started working here a week ago.

so i started going to the new west side location, but went back to this one tonight because i was on the east side of town.  bad idea - should have trusted my instincts. the waiter recognized me as a regular this time, so things seemed promising.  i asked for soy sauce when i sat down, as i *always* do, and not until he brought my order out did he tell me that they didn't have any.  fine, i will eat some of the crabs (because i was starving) and take the rest home and eat them the way i enjoy eating them - with soy sauce.  nope!  can't take leftovers home.  i said i always take my leftovers home, and he points to a sign that says that you can't.  i said i've been coming here for 3 years and always take the leftovers home - he goes \"then you should know the policy\".  um, no, i didn't know your *new* policy.  then he has the nerve to say to me snarkily \"so the reason you didn't eat them was because you didn't have soy sauce...right.\"  sorry, i don't need to explain to you why i didn't eat them, but yes, that's why.  then i tried to use my groupon which i have been able to do even on their specials in the past, but i guess this exclusion is a \"new policy\" as well.  then, the guy goes, \"next time, i'm only letting you order six at a time.\"  cool, nice way to treat your regulars.  sorry, there won't be a next time.  the worst part was the way he talked to me - i understand that there is now a new posted policy, fine, but he treated me like i was a criminal trying to steal from his business and talked to me like a parent scolding their child (the guy is the asian guy with the shaved head).  it's a shame, because i really liked this place - coming from philly, it was cool to have a place to get seafood that reminded me of home.  and the owners were great guys - they were always there in the past and greeted me warmly when i came.  the old asian waiter was also great - he would bring me soy sauce, my dozen crabs, and my drink without me saying a word to him but \"thank you\".  haven't seen the owners there since the new place opened, nor the old waitstaff who actually understood customer service."}
{"text":"Lots and lots and lots of deep fried food!!! 

Let me start off by saying that the food at Crab Corner is not my thing. I'm not big on fried foods. At all. If you like deep fried everything (especially seafood) then, seriously, look no further. 

This place is very large.  It has lots of space, several TVs, a big bar and a great patio. The smell (seafood) is very strong when you walk in the door which kind of killed my appetite a little. The staff is great.  There was one guy, who was playing host, waiter, and bus boy.  He was doing an excellent job too - very friendly and super quick. 

We ate: 
Boardwalk Fries - Pretty tasty and very well seasoned. 
Cod - This was beer battered and fried. By far the heaviest thing we ordered. 
Catfish - \"Lightly\" breaded and fried.
Onion Rings 
Hush Puppies
Pretty much all of this tasted the same and all of it tasted like greasy breading with the exception of the Cod which had a nice vinegar finish.  I kind of dug it, but I was starting to feel really gross by the time I tasted this. 
My husband really liked the hush puppies (I thought they were kind of so so) and he also thoroughly enjoyed his soft shell crab sandwich.  

I HATE to give such a low star review and was fully prepared to 3 star this place and move on. Then, hoping to salvage the meal by treating myself to a rare something sweet, I ordered the only dessert on the menu - the snow ball.  I'm sorry but this thing was unforgivable.  If you are going to put a snow cone on your restaurant menu, it should probably be a dang good snow cone. I've had better ones served to me by 9 year olds at little league games. 

I Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Las Vegas hands down! Not to mention the crab cakes and tartar sauce.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you...it was absolutely wonderful. I had crab legs and corn. The crab legs were huge. The waiter was awesome. So friendly and the service was prompt. I was me and my dad's first time there. I have to say that I will become a regular. They tend to have groupons out there every month and check their website for weekly specials."}
{"text":"I've come to crab corner a few times and always had a wonderful experience, today however was kind of weird. Ordered a soup and the initial one came out with a hair on it... It happens, I simply told the server and they changed it, no biggie. The lobster bisque is normally my favorite item on the menu and I can't get enough, I always order a big bowl, today it was bland and had almost no meat in it. Since I had already sent back the first soup I didn't want to complain and ate my bowl. When I wasn't satisfied I decided to order something else. The staff were very busy talking, looking at their phones, and gambling on the machines so by the time I ordered my food the rest of my party was almost done eating. The bartender even put money in the machines my friend and I were at and instructed us to play for her... It struck me as weird that they were playing the machines in their own establishment, but whatever. I think the worst was when we got our bill all together, we started pulling out our forms of payment and the bartender then decided she should split the bill after... Fine ok, wasn't a big deal. I put cash as I normally pay and my friend payed with card, she never came to give me change back, all she did was inform us that she had swapped our entrees by accident so we had payed for each-others meal... I waited and waited and never got my change. I'm normally a generous tipper... But a 60% tip????? I didn't have anything to drink... Just a soup and one entree, why was I out $40? Bartender comped my friends drinks, which was nice, but screwed me... Won't be returning anymore."}

Blue crabs were great, very sweet... But worth it if you don't mind getting your hands dirty!

My favorite. Their snow crab, easy to get to and delicious!!"}
{"text":"For a quick stop and no wait on a Saturday night, it was ok. I had the fried oysters which were pretty good size with a tasty batter. Coleslaw needed more dressing but it wasn't terrible. B/F had steamed combo of mussels, shrimp, crab, etc. Crab seemed it was all shell so didn't even waste time eating it. Portion size was good but just lacked flavor. I would give service higher stars than the food. I can't really expect too much on the food side though as it is Vegas and miles away from the freshness of coastal seafood."}
{"text":"Casual goodness!   We had the pleasure of having Kyle and Chillie  as our servers- excellent service!   They even honor military with the first beer on the house ( or non - alcohol)!!!!!

Fun place to just break open a crab!"}
{"text":"Fabulous crab and a great place to play with your food!  My husband and I ordered 1 lb of King crab legs and a 1/2 lb of their spiced peal and eat shrimp.  They rolled out a large piece of butcher paper, gave us nutcrackers and utensils, and let us go at it.  The seafood tasted exceptionally fresh, was steamed when ordered, and nicely seasoned with a homemade old bay.

It didn't quite make 5 stars because the ice water tasted like it came fresh from the Chesapeake (Not a plus), and the paper towels offered weren't sufficient for hand cleaning.  Bathrooms are available, but I' wished there were moist towelettes.

Overall, great place for date night or the whole family."}
{"text":"Some of the best clam strips ever fried oyster raw oyster top notch. All their sides are delicious my only complaint please bring back Tenaya Creek Brewery Haulin Oates on tap best beer ever that's what brought me in there in the first place. The food kept me coming"}
{"text":"Crab Corner is legit! As a Marylander, this place reminds me of crab houses from back home. Everything is great; MD Crab Soup, crab dip and the glorious STEAMED CRABS! This place is a must stop if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Angela and I came on a Sunday afternoon during a Baltimore and Pittsburgh game. Place is a Baltimore fan place (owners from Maryland I think) and there were plenty of fans in their Baltimore jerseys. So what's cool? When Baltimore scores, everyone in the place wearing a Baltimore jersey gets a free crab! That's pretty cool.

So what wasn't cool? The crab Angela and I got. Overcooked and way too dry. We ordered the snow and king crab. Also got an order of the calamari and hushpuppies. The calamari wasn't too tasty either. The hushpuppies on the other hand, were pretty outstanding. The sad thing is Angela ate here when they just opened and loved it. She was pretty sure it was one of our waiters that was working the kitchen and felt the new cook just sucked. Just really disappointing food."}
{"text":"Great Maryland pride and decor in this corner of a strip mall. 

We ordered the snow crab legs which were so very fresh tasting even after warming up the lest overs the next day! They were juicy and meaty. Loved them. 

We also tried their cod and fried oysters platter. These were crunchy and tasty as well. The side order of onion rings were amazing! 

We tried the crab cakes as well which were good but a little on the dry side. They tarter sauce made up for it though! 

I'd like to go back for more snow crabs maybe as a to go order. The building was a little drafty!!!"}
{"text":"went here enjoyed some calamari as well as some crab which my company happen to find rubberband still handing from a claw . didnt like the seating arrangement it was picnic table style seating and very limited . half way thru our meal we were accompanied by an elderly humorous couple luckily because all we could think about is some horrible party sitting on our bench . overall the food was ok not like i tried too much on the menu but i knew id prolly not be back for the simple fact that they're more expensive/pricey then both HOT & JUICY & BOiliNG CRAB but nowhere near established as of yet"}
{"text":"As a DC/MD/VA-area native, I perk up when I come across anything or anyone that reminds of it. I, like many from there, grew up crabbing and eating Maryland blue crabs which have a distinct buttery-sweet flavor. Steam them up in a pot with generous handfuls of Old Bay season and I'm your best friend! I travel to Vegas a few times a year from L.A. One day recently, I found myself watching a video on ways to eat blue crabs and ended up watching one from a guy who owned 2 restaurants in Vegas. WHAT?? Blue crabs in Vegas?? Sure, there are places that serve the meat in dishes (crab cakes, sushi) but I haven't heard of any that steam them and serve (dump) them on your butcher-paper-covered table with vinegar, extra seasoning, a mallet and crab knife like this place does--Chesapeake Bay-style. The peel-and-eat shrimp was also good. The boardwalk fries (similar to the ones sold at Thrasher's in Ocean City, MD) did kinda take me back. The crabs? Mouth-wateringly, finger-licking good! Although the spice blend they use isn't actually Old Bay, it's very similar. The vinegar cups they give you even have tiny peppers in them to spice it up. Plenty of DC/MD memorabilia all over so it made me feel a little bit at home. The only caveat to me was the service: although attentive and prompt, they were not terribly friendly or engaging. I wasn't expecting them to be super outgoing but still felt kinda like we were just given the food and the check and that was it. I might be able to understand somewhat if it were busy, but it wasn't while we were there. Regardless, I truly hope this place survives and sticks around for years. I appreciate the DC/MD/VA pride in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience there this afternoon with my family. First of all, the server seemed high and out of it. I could barely communicate with him. The lobster and oysters were both not cleaned properly. The shrimp was dry and tasteless. We ordered \"fresh fruit\" with my daughters chicken tenders and it was canned fruit that was rotten and bot edible. When the bill came, of course the server charged us an extra $25 for some reason and we had to get it corrected."}
{"text":"I've actually had two experiences by the time of this review

1st experience was on a Tuesday, when they had their $2 female blue crab special. Service was great and the waiters were nice. +1 right off the bat, they keep your water filled ! XD Restaurant was maybe 1/2 full? maybe a little less (around 5ish pm). not bad. 

I had ordered 5 crabs while my other friends ordered 3 more. As one of my pictures (and many other peoples pictures) show, they pour it on the table. The crabs come out on a tray the waiter carries over, and dumps it on top of a large brown butcher paper they place on the table beforehand. They give you a hammer and a knife, and just let u go at it. I've been eating crabs all my life and have prepared them so i pretty much know how to open and eat them pretty easily (granted blue crabs are smaller and require more work). Seasoning was yummy. The texture of the meat was good. and each shell had a decent amount of \"yummy stuff\" that probably only asian's eat. XD The only complaint i have of this experience is it had a slight, very slight taste that seemed it may have not been as fresh? as i had hoped (well this was my first experience so had nothing to compare). aside from that, it was great. it was a very slight taste so it didnt bother me too much. I also had ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were fried wonderfully. great color. crispy but still soft on the inside. 

2nd experience was much better. We were served by David. (Don't let looks intimidate you). Very nice guy ! This time was on a Saturday late afternoon (4:30 - 5pm). Got the opportunity to try this place again, started with a few appetizers. First off was the mini crab cakes.. small 1 oz crab cakes, maybe the size of a silver dollar. Nice golden brown color, served with lemons and tartar sauce. Very fresh taste, sweetness from the crab meat. Delicious. 2nd appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip. I actually had forgotten to read the description but sounded yummy. It came, already on sliced baguette, but loaded. The baguette was a little on the soft side, had a little trouble picking it up (could have been toasted a little more). The \"dip\" was very creamy and rich, and of course, lots of crab meat. Very heavy but delicious nonetheless. 

As for the entrees, my friend had ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries (she's not a shellfish eater so she opt'ed for the fish). She liked it. She said it reminded her of the fish from Crown & Anchor ! surprising ! +1 for crab corner. The seasoning they used with the fries, was delicious. I'd probably assume its the same seasoning they use for everything else, which makes it addicting ! ! Last but not least, the big entree. Came in a semi large pan. 3 male blue crabs, 4 pieces of corn, probably a handful of shrimp, and lots of clams and mussels on the bottom swimming in probably the water it was cooked it, topped with their very own special Maryland seasoning. I actually put the crabs off to the side and dug into the smaller things first. Shrimp was wonderfully cooked, perfectly seasoned. Cooked to perfection. Easy to peel shells. Mussels and clams were cooked nicely. Of course there's a few in there that had sand but there's nothing really the chef can due, in terms of those types of shellfish. The sand is inside the meat, and the shell is closed, so there is only so much you can do prior to cooking. The corn was nicely cooked, seasoned with their seasoning, once again. Was yummy, ate them all but didnt eat it, uhm, nicely like i usually do with corn, where i can get almost each kernal completely out cleanly. These corn, i just went at it and just mowed it down. yummy ! now the blue crabs. These were actually male blue crabs (can tell by lookin on the bottom. females have a rounded flap whereas males have a point at the end). Meat texture was great. seasoning was great. good amounts of \"yummy stuff\" i had mentioned earlier in the review. NO \"unfreshness\" taste at all this time. Cleaned the meat out of the crab. YUMMY ! so much work, but YUMMY ! 

All in all, the 2nd visit had pretty much made me re-consider this place, and maybe possibly putting it up there in one of my more favorite restaurants now. Everything is fresh. Prices are pretty good for the quality of food you get. Can't really find this elsewhere in the city. Heard they are opening another location on the west side (YES!!! MY SIDE!!!) near Tropicana and Fort Apache. Looking forward to that. But i'll definitely recommend people who like seafood to check this place out. I'll even tell my mom ! she's off on tuesdays too! sweet !"}

I also ordered the calamari.  I tasted more batter than calamari.
I also ordered the crab soup.  The soup lacked in crab flavor. It had a good blend of vegggies, but really lacked a seafood flavor."}
{"text":"My son and I had a Groupon, so we checked this place out.  What a fun time we had!  The food was delicious and the casual atmosphere was a welcome site after a rough week at work.  The staff was young, energetic and accommodating.  I'll be back and make sure and bring the rest of my family!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to see all the disappointed posts. Came here on a Tuesday, was welcomed, served appetizer and dinner on time. Crab cake can not be beat. I guess they're problem is consistency but i will be back. I have never been let down here."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets! if you are from Maryland or just want to see what eating blue crabs is all about, look no further."}
{"text":"After seeing the good reviews and hearing about it from several crab loving friends, I decided to tag along during their Tuesdays $2 blue crabs and $2 domestic bottles day. It gets very very busy on Tuesday so try to get there early. Best time to try to get there after work on Tuesday is probably around 5:30p.m. 

I am a seafood fanatic and this place doesn't disappoint... for the price on a Tuesday. I have had better, but those places can be very pricey. Of course there are some that would complain about the \"quality\" of the crabs... but everyone has to keep in mind... lots of seafood is based on the season.  The owners are very very knowledgeable too about the crabs, such as if the female crabs are fertile and will have eggs in them. 

The blue crabs were very good, and the seasoning they use is amazing. I also had their sweet potato tots... and if you have read a few of my reviews, you know I am a sweet potato lover. These tots are very good. We also ordered the crawfish, and that was really good too... and messy!

 We were all a mess at the table, so i would recommend not wearing anything that you care for here. Things tend to fly off the table and spray out. =) All in all... very good place. Not sure if I would come here any other day than Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Crab Corner FINALLY has opened another location on my side of town! And the establishment is even BETTER! (Sorry Flamingo/Eastern location) It is well located near the 215/Rainbow. And they have all the specials like the original Crab Corner. 

If you have been serviced at the Flamingo/Eastern location... then you know what to expect in regards to service since half the staff works at this location too. They have flat screens to watch your favorite sports... and they have a very nice outdoor seating area set up too. 

As for food, just as good as the original! (if you look at my review for the Crab Corner @ Flamingo/Eastern) Again... very very happy that the second location is now in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This review SHOULD be a 3.5 but I cannot bring myself to round down with the great service provided by Richard! I don't know if he was the manager, but if not he should be! He was very attentive and quick.

Our party of four wanted crabs! We're all from Delaware, and two of us have been living in the desert for a couple years, missing blue crabs like crazy. We went on \"Three Dollar Thursday\", for which we ordered 2.5 dozen large males at $4 a pop (about half price off their menu board). Before they came out, we ordered two appetizers: a blue crab dip & a crab pretzel. Both were pretty good, however I felt that the same exact crab mix was used for both apps. The only difference was melted cheese was placed over the pretzel. The pretzel made me miss Philly pretzels, not the same.

With each dozen of crabs delivered to our table, we all gave various feedback from cooked perfectly to too mushy to eat. I personally ate 5 crabs and 2 of those were on the overcooked end. That seemed to be the consensus also: somewhere around 60-70% of the crabs weren't cooked to perfection. But it was worth it. We filled our bellies and were happy. We may return if the craving ever comes back, since flying home would be a lot more pricey and time consuming rather than dealing with a less than perfect cook on the crabs. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We are weekly crab corner Trivia goers. This place has the best customer service and the trivia is really fun. They also have other weekly specials, but we mainly come for the trivia on Thursdays.

Jeremy always takes care of us and he is great! He remembers what we order and always checks in to make sure we are taken care of. I have gotten a few items on the menu and they are all tasty, but try to get their special lobster roll if they have it available. My only complaint is that I wish they had more selection on their menu.

Love this place. We will be back every Thursday!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday, was probably the first table then the place got packed. We ordered a dozen regular females for $2 each on tues/thurs, hush puppies, slaw, and cream of crab soup. Tasty indeed!! The crab does take a little bit longer then expected then a typical meal but its worth it. Jared was our server and he did an amazing job. Even when it started to pick up he was helping everyone out. Mucho kuddos to Jared!!! 

Will definitely be back... Even though I'm a Niners fan GOOOOO NINERS!!! :)"}
{"text":"crabs were good, Little small and a little over priced. the potato salad had a little something missing in it. it was a LITTLE bland, 

the owner and his brother were very nice and in fact were from the VA/ MD area that i was from. 

need to come up with some kind of special for all you can eat,,, 
and add a little more bay seasonings to the crabs while cooking... 
BUT OVER ALL THE PLACE WAS GOOD,"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I got here right before they were gonna turn off the steamers. We ordered 4 blue crabs, soft shell crab sandwich and boardwalk fries.

blue crabs- pretty fun to break open up your own crab and dip it in some butter and old bay seasoning. The servers will teach you how to properly crack open a crab.

Soft shell crab sandwich- so good. Honestly I just ate the soft shell crab, not a big sandwich person. 

Boardwalk fries- I love french Fries, however didn't concentrate on the taste as it has some seasoning on it. I was more focus on cracking up the crab.

I would def recommend and come back. 

The servers were amazing and so helpful! I wish I got their names. 

Tip- they turn off the steams at 8:30pm. So get there before 8:30! You need to give yourself enough time to enjoy the crabs!"}
{"text":"Need to stop by and see Sam at the bar Sunday's thru Wednesday for great service. He makes you feel like you are at a real local bar. Awesome service."}
{"text":"I've been to Crab Corner dozens of times and I'm never disappointed. I'm from Maryland and there are no restaurants west of the Chesapeake Bay more authentic than the Crab Corner. From the Maryland crab soup to the boardwalk fries to the steamed crabs, mussels, and clams, the food is F-ing phenominal. I'm a die hard fan."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. My husband had the Alaskan King Crab legs and loved them. The fish and chips was perfectly done, crispy in outside, just the right amount of beer batter and the homemade tartar sauce was amazing. Our party also had the blackened chicken salad, which was huge, enough for two meals. The crab cakes appetizer was full of meat and melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"To my surprise the menu has changed, no more full headed shrimp with seasonings boiled to perfection, no more regular french fries, etc. it was different.  And because of the changes it wasn't what I had bragged about to my friend, who had never been, but had seen the first location off Maryland parkway be super busy was intrigued to come with me to a late lunch.  That being said if the Maryland location has not changed too much I will only be going there, and as far as the staff here great job!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed!  We wanted seafood and usually have had good experiences here but we pulled up to find the door locked. Multiple websites state that they are open until midnight and it's only 9:38p.  There were people inside but no one would even come to the door. Wasted our timed standing there.  Please update your website."}
{"text":"Excellent service...crab cakes are huge with no fillers and Delicious. ..apricot chutney is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great owners. Super staff. DELICIOUS seafood. Prepare to get messy and enjoy yourself for a bit. Peelin shrimps and crackin crab shells takes time and skill, ha! Large, family style, picnic tables with butcher paper. Beers, wines, sports. Yum! Lookin forward to see them build on the west side!!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place every time we visit we come here!!! The black mussels are fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, not the bomb! It took us 2 hrs to eat 6 female crabs btwn 3 ppl who were STARVING. The crab was over boiled, and by the time I are my last crab, it was cold. They ran out of half the menu by 7pm- closing is at 9. Thank you, but Hot n Juicy is 110x better."}
{"text":"Came here for my first Ravens game in Las Vegas and let me tell you what a good time so far. The food is fantastic the drinks are cold and the atmosphere is fantastic! Ashley the bartender is great! Pleasure to talk to can talk football with the rest of us. Come down and check it out for yourselves!"}
{"text":"I am from Maryland and chose to celebrate my birthday here. Everything was perfect and delicious! I highly recommend the crab cakes, potato salad and crab dip! Come in for wino weds!"}
{"text":"$3 medium male crab Thursdays is what brought us in! I was excited to see that they have weekly deals like this because I love crab. They also have $2 female crab Tuesdays! 

We ordered the mini crab cake appetizer at ($9.95) these were small but full of flavor. I thought they were really good. We also got five medium male crabs. 

These were a lot smaller than I expected, but it was about 8:20pm when we walked in and they closed at 9. So maybe the bigger ones were given at the start of the day? 

These were brought out with tons of old bay seasoning on top! They were hot and delicious. As a kid when my mom boiled crabs, we also ate it with a side of white rice and some sauces, either vinegar or butter/lemon. Thankfully, Crab Corner has sides of rice! :) I was definitely excited about that. 

We didn't get the butter/lemon this time (as I was reaching for a healthier option), instead I tried it with a concoction I just threw on: a little bit of Tobasco, old bay, and malt vinger. 

That really hit the spot. 

The brothers/owners were extremely nice and friendly, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Tuesday special of $2 blue crabs. As the location is a bit far from the strip (about 15 min cab ride) the restaurant is fairly deserted around dinner time. I came for the crab but also ordered fried oysters and raw oysters. The oysters are not particularly impressive but we're fairly cheap at $1.75 each. 

Now the crabs were quite delicious! I only ordered a few, but they dump the crabs onto the table and you start grabbing it for the table like a barbarian which is quite satisfying. The crabs were surprisingly hot when we got them, and quite meaty as well. The salty/cajun seasoning is really good, but I was full after 5 crabs. A great experience overall but would love to have the place be a bit more busy and lively for a better experience."}
{"text":"Good happy hour.  We had calamari fries, Boardwalk fries, oysters in the half shell, and male crabs."}
{"text":"Came back to crab corner and was sat in Sarah's section again on Monday, food was delicious as always and her great attitude always makes the experience a home like feel. Will be be again soon. Thanks for serving great food & giving great service Sarah!"}
{"text":"we came to vegas on a business trip and spent all day at the airport.   With no energy in us we decided not to head into vegas strip and stay close by our resort since we had a early morning training.  we place an order of crab, mussle and shrimps.  While waiting  for our order we next door to the super market and grab some drinks and snacks.  15-20 minutes later we went back and paid for our food to go.  Food was so good that on our last day in vegas we went back for our last meal there."}
{"text":"The worst staff members in Vegas ......especially hostess and management me and my family arrived at the restaurant 4:45 and ask or a table the hostess tell us 30-35 whit no reservations so staying and wait 50 minutes pasted and I ask if we are getting the table soon and they give me no answer I ask for manager the manager never shows then I find out was one of the servers.... wow server and manager is a no no.....how can you support your staff if you are busy with your own costumers.... so I ask the manager if me and my family are getting a table and he's answer was NO because is Father's Day and and they taking the reservations and he can't do anything for me  ok....now is 1:15 minutes and I ask the hostess again if we are getting any table and she says few tables are leaving and you are next so I wait .... then more people show up and get the table right away now me and my family are frustrated with the situations...... tell the hostess to put my name on the list and she did in a very sarcastic way she tell me I can get the table by 7:30 .... wow again so I ask for 800 corporate number and she tell me I can call the owners and give me the number so I call it and even is and answer machine she act like she is answer the phone and said sorry you are not getting any table tonight...... so I take my party of 6 and go somewhere else.... I feel bad for the owners I hope they find better people who cares more about the business the food is good been there couple times but never again ....i work in the service industry and I will never recommend this to anybody......."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but the quality of the food and the service just wasn't there for me. Plus something I ate there gave me a really bad stomach ache after.. So I'll stick to the other spots around town still.. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Highly recommend the soft shell crab and crab appetizer! Didn't care for the Maryland Crab soup, but service was excellent!"}

{"text":"They have roaches in the store and when a roach came out of my food I told the manager and he immediately started to blame me and said I snuck it into the store ... like why the hell would I have roaches in my pocket ... ??!! Don't believe me I have the case number .. the cops came"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch. The crab cakes are the best that I have had in Nevada."}
{"text":"It was really bad food the crab was smiling bad seems  like not fresh they have it from 5 days ago it's my first and last time there"}
{"text":"First time here and I really dig this place. Super chill atmosphere. Variety of music. Our bartender AJ was happy to share knowledge about the menu and even make suggestions on signature dishes like the bacon wrapped shrimp! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I found this place after MUCH research as a surprise to my husband so that we could enjoy the Ravens game on the last Sunday of regular season. It is a little hard to find in the strip mall, but as soon as we got close I was thrilled to see the gentleman outside sporting a Ravens hat in the actual shape of the mascot (akin to the Green Bay cheese hat), a Suggs jersey, and purple and black Mardi Gras beads. GO RAVENS!!!! 

The bright yellow and red walls are a salute to the Maryland Flag. Much of the wall space is adorned with flags, decals, and posters for the Ravens, the Orioles, and the University of Maryland Terrapins. Apparently, this place flies their blue crabs in daily, although they had just run out of males before we walked in. They have beer and crab specials during the game, so my husband was able to enjoy a few crabs (although they weren't very impressive and were on the small side, even for females). 

The cream of crab soup was pretty mediocre, and I kept crunching on tiny bits of crab shells. Other reviewers claimed that there were large chunks of crab, but I didn't see anything like that in my particular cup of soup. Still, we were really happy to be there for the camaraderie. It was great to cheer along with other Ravens fans, and we talked to several people who were either visiting or had moved to the Las Vegas area from Maryland and were looking for a slice of home. We'd definitely come back here for another football game!! Two stars for the food, a million stars for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm in this area of town for work for the week and bookmarked several places to grab lunch. Crab Corner was my #1 pick. Sadly, on Monday, I got out at 11AM for an hour lunch, only to find this place closed. Looked it up later and they don't open til 11:30AM for lunch. Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open. Highly suggest they open a smidge earlier, they're losing out on business.

In any case, I managed to make it in and service was polite- placed a to go order for a crab cake sandwich, had a little bit of sticker shock at the $13 price tag that didn't even include fries or an add-on option for a discounted soup (as other menu items do). Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.

Crab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed. Filling portion, though.

Would come back for some fresh seafood or other menu items. Their website indicates that they have various discounts and promotions, and Tuesdays in particular they offer $2 male or female blue crabs and $2 beers, which I sadly could not take advantage of during work hours."}
{"text":"Was not very impressed!! The food was not very good at all ! I believe that Hot and Juicy and Urban Crawfish is way better !! I asked for a recommendation and the waiter actually told me that other places have better Fish and Chips !! It was kind of funny !! 

Decor was expected and price was average ! Wait staff was odd !! One guy kept giving us water when we only took a couple sips and one of the girls stuck her butt right on our table taking a photo of a group and was not even worried about it ! Will not be going back as there are much better places !!

Not looking for fusion style !! Flavor is important and the soft shell crabs had none !! Sides were very average and the best rating thing we had were the fries ! Must say that the shrimp was like eaten Ngo fried shrimp at Sizzler or Red Lobster !"}
{"text":"Hubby is still drooling over the lobster he had when we were there, and the blue crabs I had still bring a smile to my face.  Definitely looking forward to a return visit there, but I need to try to remember to bring wet wipes with me - my hands were a total mess!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Ordered the blackened mahi mahi. No flavor and overcooked. Poy Boy bread was hard. Onion rings were hard like if they have been reheated. Steamed shrimp were overcooked. The French fries were really good. Our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"I was bummed to notice their other location (east side) closed, so when I started craving seafood, I hauled on over here. Everything is super fresh and the beachy decor kind of lets you delude yourself into thinking you've taken a brief vacation. Except for the video poker built into the bar, but hey, you're still in Vegas.

Happy Hour is offered daily from 2-6PM, with buck-a-shuck oysters! Their cocktail sauce is nice and thick, and the horseradish is super spicy, but these are just as enjoyable plain. Crab cakes are a good option, and if you're feeling especially indulgent (or with a group), try the Crab Pretzel- a soft Bavarian style pretzel topped with Anapolis-style crab salad and cheese. 

The steamer sampler is always a good option fora couple (or a trio!), with shrimp and three kinds of crab. I'm not the hugest fan of \"market pricing\" because you don't really have an idea how much you'll be spending (and it can really add up!), but you can certainly call before you visit. Staff have been pretty friendly when I've been in. 

TIP: Blue crab + spicy vinegar = awesome!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better is absolutely right. Tried this place out for lunch with a friend. Have to say the service was decent. Ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. What a joke. 4 of the 7 oysters they gave us had absolutely no meat in them. It just looked like gray slime. So I am sure that's why we got an extra one to try to make up for the pathetic ones. And they had the nerve to charge $10.50 for them. I've had better oysters at AYCE sushi restaurants in this town or even Tides Oyster Bar @ Sunset Station. Ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for $13.99 (I believe). It was good I have to say but I have again had better. Tarter sauce was good though. I don't know that I'd particularly go back to this place & spend my hard earned dough when I know other places that have better food. Possibly only for happy hour when items are discounted."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was great,  and the staff was really helpful. The atmosphere is really fun and enjoyable.

I came here after looking at other crab restaurants in town, and this one caught my eye. Plus I came on a Tuesday where they have specials on their blue crab. I sat down and a very nice lady told me she comes every week and gave me the run down on how everything works. Be prepared as this is a place where you get your hands dirty. They put down butcher paper and bring you your food in baskets. She recommended the potato salad with my crab and it was very delicious.

I enjoyed the special $2 beers, more crab than I could ever eat and the drawn butter kept flowing. The crab was perfectly cooked.

I will definitely be coming back here every time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Never having had Maryland crabs before, this was an eye-opening experience.  Luckily, I was with a pro, from Baltimore, who knew the in's and out's of opening & eating these delightful crustaceans.  We started with the crab cake appetizer... not my favorite crab cake ever, but nice for a starter... then delved into the actual crab.  At Crab Corner, you order by size - S, M, L - or you can choose Female crabs, which I'm told have \"mustard\" and \"roe\" just like lobster.  We ordered Large and I'm glad we did.  Not a quick meal, it's one to dig in & enjoy the company of those you're with. The seasoning on the crab was really good - finger licking good, actually.  It was a fun meal out, one I would definitely do again.  I'm excited that they're opening a 2nd location, at Ft. Apache & Flamingo, early in 2012."}
{"text":"Ehhh wasn't impressed.

The restaurant had caught my eye a few times before but never really went in to try it until tonight only because my sister had a groupon she didn't want to use.

The restaurant wasn't too crowded tonight but there were enough dining in on a Friday night.

We ordered the crab cake sandwich, soft shell crab sandwich, and a side of fries. (Don't sandwiches usually come with fries??) The price was a bit steep for food that wasn't impressive. 

I didn't want to order any seafood that I would much rather go to hot n juicy for or boiling crab for fear that I would be disappointed. I'm sure glad we didn't. Sandwiches were mediocre at best. 

The servers tonight were in their own little world. Some were working, others were socializing with the customers or on their phone.. Big turnoff!

Verdict - we won't be coming back and unfortunately if one were to crave seafood I say you're better off at boiling crab or hot n juicy."}
{"text":"If you want great seafood and incredible service, with cold yummy beers, this is your spot. Sam the bartender is amazing and the place will have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"A little over priced and under staffed. It took what seemed like forever to have my order taken but the person was nice and appologetic. The food is okay. I ordered the cod with fried oysters, board walk fries and slaw. I have definitely had better...

The cod was like any other in town with the exception of long John silver (that place is hell). I was really looking forward to the oysters but unfortunately the batter was soggy and made for an unpleasant experience. Fries are fries and the slaw lacked seasoning. Oh well...the whole experience was an hour that felt like a lifetime. This included waiting to get my check and pay.  If there is an upside...the people are courteous. 

Perhaps I will try it for happy hour and see if it is any better."}
{"text":"Tried this place because I heard of the  2 for Tuesday deal, blue crab for $2 a piece.  Came in at 8 PM. They \"ran out.\" We still tried the crab. $6 for large, $8 for jumbo. The 3 large ones were good, the jumbo one was not. Crab was just steamed with dry Cajun seasoning on top. 
Tried the king crab $30 a lb. came with 2 legs, meat was good but definitely not worth the price. 
Fried oysters were good. Came with about 10 pieces and 2 sides. 
Fried shrimp were small. 
Fish and chips were ok.

The biggest problem with this place is the flavor, food is mainly steamed or deep fried so flavor is lacking. 

If you're Asian, you would hate this place because we love the spices and flavor in our food.

Will not be returning.
Food  didn't fill me up. Very disappointed. 
Much cheaper to just buy the crab at the store and steam it myself."}
{"text":"Ordered XLarge crab.. 1/2 hour later for take out. They were going to give me the uncooked version. So after 15 more min. I received the regular size crab. I asked, this can't be the XLarge size. He said. That it is becuz we measure it. Dude I'm still in my server restaurant outfit for Caesars, I'm not stupid, that's a mini me crab."}
{"text":"At first glance you might not think much but 
I decided to try it with my daughter and we loved it. Inside was low key, looks pretty average but the food and service was great! there was No wait coming in and our waitress was the absolute sweetest. I believe her name was Sarah? She was very friendly and helpful since we were first timers. She gave us great tips and was very attentive. Food was fresh and delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the snow crab  my wife got the catfish. The prices are good and we both enjoyed our meals. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"We came here for our fourth and final time. I noticed a steady decline in the quality of food each time we came back. I ordered the 1/3 pound crab cake platter. The crab cake platter came with two sides...I ordered the sweet potato fries and the hush puppies. The crab cake was just okay. It didn't really taste like crab. Ive had better crab from Walmart to be honest. The fries were very soggy and limp. The only thing I really liked was the hush puppies. They were as another reviewer stated \"legit\". My wife ordered the garlic blue crab plate. After about ten minutes of waiting for her food one of the staff came over and told my wife and our friend that the crab they ordered wasn't good and they'd need to order something else. We were very happy that they at least told us the crab was bad but then it really made us think about if we want to ever eat here again. We got our answer not once but twice! My wife decided on getting the peel and eat shrimp. It was bland and had a funky sauce that came with it. Then what put me over the top was when we got our bill. They charged us an 18% gratuity! For me my wife and two kids they charged us. They also charged our friend 18% gratuity and it was just her and her daughter. WTF!!! Right then and their I knew I was done with this place. I'll bet they charge everyone the gratuity and most people don't even look at their bill. It's sad because I always tip but I don't want to be forced to tip. To me the way they do it it's like stealing."}
{"text":"Very Good!!.... Kind Of Expensive But None The Less Very Worth The Money If You Love Seafood As Much As I Do You'll Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Me and my sis went for lunch and waa excited to try something new.. for starters they only have a select number of appetizers on the menu during NON Happy Hour Hours which was disappointing.. the crab cakes were very small.. the taste was ok but I waa looking for the true crab cakes taste.. I ordered a Caesar Salad and when it came out it was a regular side salad with Caesar dressing so it had tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and croutons.. my sis had the lobster bisque soup  which she said it was puree almost.. the soft shell crab was my meal and I will def. pass while she had the fried shrimp.. the tarter sauce was not good.. the upside is its a cool atmosphere.. I dont think we will be back.. but please try it for your self.."}
{"text":"I went there around 5:30 today. The crabs are really not fresh. This is my first time to go there because my friend said last time the crabs were fresh and delicious. But omg I felt sick when I ate the crab today. The crab roe was sour and the crab meat was stale?also the service is bad. No one come to add water and soda for us. Anyway. Really disappointed with it. And will not go there anymore."}
{"text":"I love Crab Corner. I like the idea and the concept behind it. Fresh crab flown in from Maryland for our own pleasure here in the desert. I have sampled most of their menu, and have yet to find anything I dislike. Please, if you come to a place called Crab Corner and order a chicken sandwich, you forfeit your right to complain.
They have great happy hour specials (I believe $4 wine and beer), and a number of appetizers to choose from. Also, they have $1 Oysters during happy hour and on Sundays. Yes, their oysters are small but the texture is just right and they are always fresh. So, if you are a fan of huge, briny oysters this is not the place for you. The price point matches what you get. I've also had their calamari fries which were delicious. We have shared the garlic steam pot among four people ($49.99) and it was filled with corn, shrimp, and various types of crab. I have also had their fried soft shell blue crab and it was perfect. They offer several sides but my favorite were the fried okra and sweet potato tots.
The service was great, the price point just right, and the interior was spacious with a fully stocked bar. On certain nights they host trivia there and it gets pretty packed. After having a huge feast for four, and eating what seems to be 800 pounds of crab I was shocked at how reasonable our bill was.
I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Im from NC and mann that garlic steam sampler was the best it was me and my brother and we couldn't even eat the whole thing but it was all a 1 service was great food was even better"}
{"text":"This is the best place for eating every type of crab or fried seafood for a great price and in a casual setting! The snow crab is even sweeter than the King which I never find at other places so I specifically go there just for that and of course the xlarge blue crabs! I order to goo quite often too and its always fresh and amazing, staff is helpful and friendly, they serve beer, and from what I understand they import the freshest crabs you can find being that they also are a restaurant supplier. I read other reviews about being out of crab but to me that just means that its that good, so I would suggest trying something different if that's your experience because you wont be disappointed. The crab cakes are a favorite of mine for sure! Both locations are nice, obviously the newer one is a bit fancier in a few ways, but food is what Im after and both locations have amazing crab! Please open one in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"From Maryland finally tried the crab here today.  Bought 10 crabs very little seasoning and 5 out of the 10 crabs were mushy meat and tasted horrible....very disappointed"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place...then I arrive. It smelled a little too fishy for my taste, not horrible, so we decide to give it a chance. Then comes the waiter...he was texting the whole time he was taking our drink order!!! Really!?!? That was too much for me. We got up and left without even trying what they had to offer. What a shame, I was really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Came a long way for a Maryland style crab cake and got it! Not to mention the crab legs were awesome. Jared was a great host!"}

We were sat in the bar area, had the same bartender and now we will always ask to sit in this same spot--we are hooked. Tasty fresh seafood at reasonable prices feels like I am sitting on the Maryland shore. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ok it is their first week of business at this location. I will give them some slack for that, hence the 2nd star. Went there for lunch with a coworker. Pricey, Plan to spend $13+ for lunch. We consider this expensive for a work day lunch. So, we opted for the special soup which was $8 for a styrofoam bowl full. *shudders at styrofoam*  The waiter raved about the crab soup over the lobster bisque so we tried it. My co worker liked it, but I only ate half which is highly unusual for me. It was a bit fishy for my liking, seemed they were masking smelly cheap crab with too heavy paste like cream & lots of pepper. Even ran into a shell chip or two. Ick. The only thing that got me really crabby ( bad pun) was it took over 1/2 hour for them to ladle out 2 bowls of soup, plunk down a handful of saltines, and napkins. Ridiculous! I will say the hush puppies we split were top notch.. The ambience is horrible, school bus yellow walls with stop sign red below chair rail, think nursery school, or sports team. Ya I get they're football fans but its a bit too teenage boys bedroom. Coincidentally, all the wait staff & cooks were younger asian men...Not sure what that means? Its an oxymoron, I don't put Maryland crab expertise..think fishermen, think sea captains, think east coast old world, think Loyola, ...with surfer dudes toting iPods.  Either way, Service was laughably bad, food pricey for fried fare, ambience none existent. Doubt we will return."}
{"text":"So I want to start off by saying everything we had was delicious.... We found this place from a groupon.  We came in town for a conference and decided to bring my parents and our kids, there were 6 of us that being said two were children one 8 and the other 11.  The waiter was friendly but never anywhere to be found, when I ask for the check I noticed he added 18% to my bill, My husband and I waited tables all through high school and college so we tip between 20 and 25% always, I gave them 3 stars because first of all the service sucked we saw him all of 3 times he came back once in the hour and forty five minutes that we were there to fill our tea and water the rest of the time it was just to drop off our food he didn't even clear the dirty dishes out of the way till he brought the check.. I should be happy he saved me money because my husband would have insisted on leaving at least 20% but when he saw that he put 18% tip on for 4 adults and 2 children he agreed.. I really would say for the price of the meal and the lack of service go somewhere else there are so many other places in the Las Vegas area where you will have better service.. I wish I could say we would be back but I think we will be looking for other places to visit on our next trip."}
{"text":"Very tasty experience. I have been twice at the time lf this review.  I love the seafood smell when you walk into the place. I had the po boy sandwich with chips. The chips were out of this world!!! The sandwich was tasty too. The next time I had the garlic steamer and it was full of good stuff. Shrimp,  crab, and corn. It was delicious. It was hot,steamy and we'll seasoned. Our bill was a little pricey but we also had two drinks and my husband ordered his own meal. The steamer is plenty to share.  

Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Genuine Maryland Crab, great service and a Love for University of Maryland College Park. Doesn't get better than this.

I came for a all you can eat crab buffet event with my college alumni group and we had a great time. The atmosphere was welcoming and the servers were really friendly. I plan to watch all Terp games there"}
{"text":"Not bad of a place. Cool staff that make feel very welcomed . Crab cakes are to die for. I'm coming Back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I always visit this place on my yearly Vegas trips. The service is impeccable and the seafood is as good as it gets. The crab cake is one of the best 'I've had with great flavor an large lumps of crabs with little filler. I also got the Alaskan crab legs on this visit and they were some of the best  I have had hands down.  The bar area is a great set up as the back opens up with a view of the patio which is great on a nice day. I actually hit this establishment twice on my visit since I enjoyed it so much the first day I arrived. Its not too far of the strip with 5 star food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I guess I should start with a disclaimer. I have never been a big fan of eating crab because it's too much work for too little return. But my buddy promised that this will change my mind since they have the freshest crab in Las Vegas. Crab Corner is a small restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. Very unimpressive from the outside. Inside, it is very informal. The wait staff was super friendly. Before they bring out the food, they bring a fresh piece of brown paper to cover the table. You eat your crabs directly on the paper tablecloth. No plates for eating the crab. They to provide a small wooden mallet and a plastic knife to assist in opening the crabs and extracting the meat. We started by ordering 8 small crab cakes followed by 2 large crabs for our lunch. Crab cakes were all crab with little or no filler. It was served with a very tasty tartar sauce. Very nice. Next came the crabs. Our server was incredibly helpful showing me how to open the crab properly. However, when all is said and done, this didn't change my mind about eating crab. It was way too much work for way too little return. And, I felt it was a little pricey ($22) for an informal lunch in a small unpretentious restaurant in a strip mall. Despite five star service, I still can only give it a 3 star rating. If you are dying to try really fresh crab in a very informal setting, Crab Corner is probably worth a try for you. However, for me, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I finally got to go to crab corner on Saturday with my daughter & my friend. It was her first time going as well.  I heard alot of good reviews & the pictures looked delicious. I enjoyed the food very much the garlic steam pot was just like the pictures I saw & I could see why it was $64.99. The reason why I couldn't give them 5 stars was due our waiter Greg. I informed him that we had separate bills me & my daughter from my friend.  I asked for the garlic steam pot & he went into how much it cost like I couldn't afford it then he went on to say it's alot of food for just the two of us & how it's enough for 3 people.  I was like wait a minute why is he trying to get me to change my order & how does he know we couldnt eat it all. It's my money let me get what I want I felt like he didn't want me order it. My friend was kinda unsure because she wanted both catfish & fried oysters so he offered to combine her plate with both instead of ordering them separately. I ordered 2 appetizers mini crab cakes (delicious) & crab pretzel.  I got one appetizer b4 dinner & the other one (crab pretzel) came with our entr√©es.  Since my crab pretzel came with our food I didn't get to eat it cuz I wanted to enjoy our entr√©es b4 our food got cold. I didn't understand that.  Then on top of that when my friend plate arrived she only had fried oysters her catfish was missing. She had to wait 10 more minutes for them to deliver 1 piece of fish. No butter was given to us for our crabs & I had to ask twice for napkins. Our waiter was no where to be found. I had to ask the hostess who seated us for butter. I could see our waiter talking & laughing with other customers sitting around us & I tried to call him by his name to get his attend but he walked off like he didn't hear. The couple he was talking to right next to us felt the need to say I'm sorry after they saw me trying to get his attention.  He never checked in with us too see if we needed anything only to apologize to my friend for messing up her order.We both felt he didn't deserve a tip but being the person I am I gave him $5 dlrs & she gave him $3 dlrs.  All in all I would go back for the food the fried soft crab & those crab cakes is worth my return just hopefully I get a different waiter."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place! She love banging, and smashing on the crabs. The restaurant is laid back and has a small bar plus an outdoor area. They have Crab brought in every day so look for the specials on the big blackboard. They sell crab by the pound and the size, and sex. They have blue crab but check first. 

The service is a bit rustic and so it the presentation. But they usually have a Game on, and cold beer and crabs, shrimp and all, so laid back and smash some crab. 

They do have a small selection of no seafood items like chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich. 

Check for their happy hour for specials"}
{"text":"Food and service excellent! Oh a grilled free range, fresh coleslaw and garlic green beans. Absolutely delicious. My husband had crab chowder soup to start off with. And he had a crab cake sandwich, also delicious. And chocolate cake for dessert with vanilla ice cream yummy."}
{"text":"This rating is solely based on the customer service!! 
I'm not a seafood fan myself but I came here to eat with my boyfriend. As soon as we got seated we were approached by our server, Richard. (Or at least that was the name on the receipt not too sure if thats his name??? Never introduced himself) mid way through walking us through the menu, he reached into his pocket to check his phone, rude. Our food was brought out all at different times, which I found weird because people usually eat at the same time.... He came around to check on us once but when we asked for some hot sauce he look annoyed???? Now at the end my boyfriend got a crab cake and 1st he never brought it out but we didn't say anything because the restaurant was sort of busy so when we got the check he then realized and brought it over and 2nd no utensils were brought... no problem because everyone forgets but we couldn't get him to look over to ask him for some....Idk it gave us a bad vibe with his personality and attitude. Hope he's a little more happy next time we come."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday.  Nice, casual place.  Lobster bisque and Cream of Crab soup were absolutely delish!  Also had the two-item entree:  clam and shrimp.  They were alright.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Crab corner was amazing! Prices weren't that bad & they had great customer service. We showed up about 30 minutes before closing and never once did we feel like we were a burden. The environment is so comfortable, and the staff are very friendly! Not to mention the food was delicious! There is so much to choose from it was hard to not order the whole menu! I absolutely love their crab dip, also the crab legs were so good, as well as the black mussels. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Great food for good price! Highly recommend. Big crab legs for a great price. The shipwreck po boy was amazing as well."}
{"text":"We just had another Superb Trip to Crab Corner on S.Rainbow again for the \"BEST SEA FOOD IN VEGAS\". It may take us a while to get there from Centennial Hills bu we think it's so worth the trip because the Seafood is so Fresh & Delicious that the ride does not matter because of what you get there for a dinner. We started out woth a Seafood Gumbo that was to die for. All kinds of Seafood and some great shrimp to boot. Then we had the Crab Cakes with 2 sides and we chose the Potato Salad & Cole Slaw that were both scrumptious to devour.
If your in the area do yourself a favor and stop by Crab Corner to eat. From a fish sangwich to Lobster you will Love it. And, you can call in for fresh Lobster every day and take it out Live or they will cook it for you at a Great Price. You can't go wrong here & Jeremy was our server and he is Tops Too."}
{"text":"Great place! The guys working there are reality nice and as a first time crabber,  they showed me and my fiance how to open up the shell! And the food was fresh and great!"}
{"text":"This was a good place to eat, clean and good food. I have had a hard time finding good catfish in Vegas, and now my quest is over. The only thing is that they had a big drink cooler case that was so very loud that you could hardly think or talk. The employees said they even hate it and tried to fix it with no success. They said its the compressor and I hope so because it needs to be fixed fast."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Crab Corner based upon reviews and recommendations.  I was disappointed to say the least.  I ordered the Annapolis Crab Dip for the table, assuming it would be a good portion, as most places give you \"too much\" for an appetizer.  This was not the case.  Although it was DELICIOUS - it was only six baguettes with crab dip on top of them for $10.99.  Unacceptable.  I and two others ordered the Lobster Roll.  It was all bread.  Although the bread was delicious - I was not there to eat bread.  The fries were cold and tasted old.  When another party brought that to the attention of the waiter, within minutes he brought out steaming hot fries ...... still tasting 'old.'  Another party got hush puppies and one of which was not fully cooked.  This same person ordered Cod which was not fully cooked in the middle.  Overall a disappointing experience, especially since they added the tip to the bill and nowhere was it noted that they would be doing this.   I MIGHT try it again for the crab.  But the lobster just did not live up to my expectations.  Also tried the Lobster Bisque - it was 'ok.'  Very expensive for so many disappointments."}
{"text":"pretty pricey and their shrimps is very salty. I'm giving 3 stars because of their good customer service."}
{"text":"Lobster Rolls can't be beat!! A Must try!!! Chowder, Shrimp salad sandwich has large shrimp and was wonderful as well. Crab cakes were yummy... Have been back a few times.. So far consistent and love it!"}
{"text":"Great food, but pretty pricey for what you get. 

The atmosphere is nice and casual. Went on a Monday afternoon and it was steady but not overly crowded.

Their crab dip is excellent, and their crab cakes might be the best I've ever had. All meat, almost no filler.

It well be a while before I return, but only because of the price. About $25 to $35 per person, plus appetizers."}
{"text":"I go here for the best fried oyster po boy I have ever had period...the oysters here are nice and big they fry them in a type of batter instead of corn meal which is yummy...you get about 5 oysters on a sandwich trust me you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"The crab legs and crab cakes were pretty good but it was pretty over priced. It was like going to Joe's Crab Shack only not as good and more expensive. The iced tea was so weak, it tasted like water that someone accidentally poured a shot of weak iced tea into. The service was so so... They showed up in a timely manner after we were sat and did, at some point check on us a while after appetizers and after the meal but we had to flag them down for anything else. It wasn't terrible but, if I want crab, I'm going to Joe's CS. Glad to check it off my list of places to try but they didn't come back."}
{"text":"The fried seafood is good, but a bit overpriced. I could get something almost as good at Long John Silvers for alot less. Overall, it was ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Their service was amazing...  The servers were friendly and explained the menu in great detail for us first-time goers.  The food was a bit overpriced for my taste.  Great customer service but a bit lacking on the food area."}
{"text":"I am a super fan for the Crab Corner Southwest!  I love the indoor / outdoor bar which comes with bartenders who are friendly, personable and know how to make great cocktails.  They have New Castle and Magic Hat on draft which are 2 of my favorite draft beers right now.  I like that they have a Shuffleboard table, Corn Hole and Beer Pong which makes hanging out with my friends all the more fun.  I met the owners (2 brothers) and they are super passionate about everything Maryland and always have a great game playing on the 9 TV's so you are not going to miss anything.  (yes I am a football fan)  They also make sure to get the Freshest Seafood possible (which I love) by having LIVE blue crab flown in daily!  I asked for the secret recipe for the crab dip but there was no way I was going to get it.  :O)

Now about my favorite items on the menu.......  I am a huge foodie and love trying different food and immediately fell in love with multiple menu items.  I know blue crab is a little more work but once you get crab picking down the meat is sweet and delicious and worth the little mess that comes with it.  Below are my favorites so far............  

LOVE!!

BLUE CRABS W/ THE SPICE & DRAWN BUTTER
CRAB DIP (SO GOOD)
MINI CRAB CAKES
HEAD ON SHRIMP WITH THE SPICY SAUCE
SOFT SHELL SANDWICH IS PERFECT FOR LUNCH
BOARDWALK FRIES (I ASK FOR A LITTLE EXTRA CRISP & EAT THEM WITH THE MALT VINEGAR)
OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL ARE ALWAYS FRESH
CLAM STEAMERS
PEI MUSSELS

***The service will get better as I read in earlier reviews...  People its a new restaurant and new staff, they are going to have to work out the kinks so look beyond those silly reviews and come in and experience what its like to be in Maryland at a traditional crab house!"}
{"text":"Great service at a table near the bar. Bartender was nice and made good recommendations. Killer happy hour 3 dollar tap beers 1 oysters. Go on Wednesday for the fresh lobster dinner they pull them fresh out of the tank, and they taste great."}
{"text":"Spectacular food and equally impressive service. This place is going to become a tradition for all future Vegas trips. Off the strip and plenty of parking, the steamed sampler was far tastier and more affordable than anything on the strip."}
{"text":"So you know when you hear those excessive ads on the radio it'll get to you sooner or later. My roommate and I ventured here and we were clearly in Ravens territory. It's a casual joint with TVs and a bar that opens out to the patio as well. I'm a seafood lover and was really excited to try everything. We started with 2 dozen happy hour oysters priced at $1 a piece. That was refreshing. Then we ordered bacon wrapped scallops in which you can't go wrong with that. Their crabs and clams were just \"ok\" maybe because it's not in season. The size of the seafood items were rather small. However, their crab cakes were decent. Overall, we weren't impressed with the food. Food quality price ratio is definitely not great our bill came close to $90."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as well as the service.  The bacon wrapped shrimp....soooooo good.  I will be going back again and again"}
{"text":"Great fresh oysters, we arrived late, so Maryland crab were in a bit of sort supply.  Wait staff was busy kind of ignored us for 10-15 minutes, I had to go to the front counter to see if anyone would take our order.  They apologized and brought appetizers.  Great spicy seasoned crabs, tasty, fresh and flavorful...yummy.  Great side dishes, we had the sweet potato fries and hushpuppies...anything fried is good!  Great place to grab a beer and have some fresh crab...."}
{"text":"Great casual staff. Fresh crab flown in daily. If you actually know how to navigate authentic smaller East coast blue crab do it. If you are not well-versed in painstakingly breaking one of these bad boys down, make sure to get help from the staff. Their side dishes could be a bit more (cough cough) fresh as in their shellfish, but for a fun night and some tasty interactive dining two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We come here alot. The best food , and amazing staff. Never been disappointed. Sam makes sure we always leave happy."}
{"text":"I've had a restaurant.com gift certificate for this place for nearly year and just now finally got around to using it. I wasn't too excited going in. I've been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.

It's a small and unassuming restaurant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.

We were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.

The menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.

After ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)

We opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it's called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have \"regular\" up to \"jumbo\"), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.

The soup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).

We will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on here, my husband and I decided to try it out. We ordered takeout. We got the mini crab cakes for both of us, I ordered the clam strip platter with boardwalk fries and hushpuppies, and he got the soft shell crab platter with sweet potato tots and applesauce.  The only thing of his I tried was the sweet potato tots--crisp and yummy! He said the soft shell crab was great also, but I'm sure he'll elaborate in his own review.

The mini crab cakes were awesome! Big chunks of sweet crab meat with hardly any filler--just the way crab cakes should be. The clam strips were some of the best I've had. It's quite rare to get fried clam strips that are freshly prepared instead of pre-frozen, especially out here in the desert. They survived the journey home really well along with the hush puppies, which were nice and crisp on the outside and well seasoned. The boardwalk fries were soggy, but that may have been because of the combination of vinegar and a car ride home in styrofoam. I'll probably get the sweet potato tots like my husband next time we get takeout, but I'd still like to try the boardwalk fries in restaurant to see if they come out crisper because the flavor was good. I also ordered an ice cream cookie sandwich, which they waited to make until we arrived to pick up the food. That kept it from completely melting all over the place, which was considerate of them.  We also got a fresh brewed iced tea, but it tasted kind of funny to me. Not terrible, but I'll be cautious getting it again because I love good iced tea. 

All in all I'd say our experience was a great one--the food traveled well and didn't get soggy except for the fries, and the person I talked to on the phone as well as the one who took our money were both very friendly and helpful. I look forward to returning to dine in restaurant to see how the service is!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group, and we all ordered different things (fish and chips, Mahi Mahi, BLT, and a few other fish dishes, around $12-$15 for most entrees). The drinks were okay and they had a decent selection. The service was pretty good. The food was WAY too over-salted and over-spiced, to the point where you couldn't even taste the fish and were left guzzling water all night. It was highly distracting and completely unsatisfying. I have attended Trivia here a couple times, though this was my first time ordering dinner, and I can at least say trivia is a good time, even if dining isn't."}
{"text":"Would absolutely go again. Went on a Thursday, great beer special $3!! The waiter was perfect, knew the menu back and forth as was just patient with us."}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to give this joint a 4 star just because of their old bay chips, which were delicious, and their crab pretzel although I certainly wish the dip was adjacent to the pretzel. Perhaps a choice variation to the crab dip option? 

Anyways, the negative part of the review comes from the sandwich and the bisque. The bisque was probably a few days old or perhaps just a bad batch but it was horrid and what little lobster flavor it did have was rancid and made me glad there was no actual lobster meat (which by the way their grub hub pay says has plenty of). 

The ShipWreck Po'Boy is properly named but that is only because it truly was a shipwreck for me. Again, the oysters were rancid and cold, the catfish tasted as though it was caught a few months ago, frozen, and then sat around for a week before being fried. Shrimp were decent and the baguette was fine which saved the place from being a total shipwreck. 

As of this writing, it will be hard for me to ever order from this place again given the litany of options in Las Vegas which I travel to and too often for work and play."}
{"text":"Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, there prices are really fair. The food was fresh. When you walk in you're not hit by that overwhelming fishy smell which is a really good sign. It's a cool little place that reminds me of all the small seafood joints along the coast back home in Southern California. Tables were clean, food was great, and the servers were all really friendly. I'll be frequenting here from now on.

**Just to note - The prices on the Yelp app under the menu section is not accurate."}
{"text":"Nice place with good staff.  Food is good and fresh.  If you enjoy crab, this is the place to go.  We had crab cakes, onion rings, and of course some really good crab.  I enjoyed everything about it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh seafood! When I'm in vegas this is the place for blue crabs and fresh seafood! Everything is so good, especially the raw oysters! I think I had like 10 to myself, it's only $1 each plus it tasted sweet and fresh. Everything is very affordable given into consideration it's seafood. The only thing I would not order again is the Cajun saucy shrimp. It just tasted to strong and overpowering, I love boiling crab and the way they make their shrimp but this place felt like I was literally eating a scoop of dry Cajun powder mix with oil in every bite. To end the service was wonderful, the asian guy in the ponytail is very sweet, helpful and had great genuine customer service for the past few times I've been here. Don't forget to ask if they have any special deals when you're there, I know on certain days of the week they have pretty awesome deals:)"}
{"text":"Im a fan of the lobster bisque and the crab special on tuesday. For the record i like crabs, but i don't like to do the work. If I don't have to do any-work then I'm down for coming here. Side note the crabcakes were ok- it was missing some black pepper or some other type of season."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, had the whole crabs I had been looking for, and it was $2 tuesday which you can get a small crab or beer for that price. I also had a side of coleslaw and rice, both were good. My server Devin was great, polite, and even demonstrated had to take the crab apart. There were plenty of tables to sit at, so no wait, and the food came out at in a reasonable amount of time. Wish I came here before that crappy hot n' juicy place."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, food was great.  Had a shrimp omelet and eggs benedict with crab cakes.  Perfectly cooked, with the all you can drink menu.  Not too busy on this stormy day.  Good service nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hum where should I start....lets see when we walked in we weren't sure if it was a bar or a restaurant and only a few people in the place, kinda dark and uninviting. 

The waitress/hostess was nice however didn't offer any specials and after we ordered I noticed a chalk board with info on it and asked what it was she said oh that's the specials and crab prices of the day....which would have been good to know before we ordered our non-crab items. 

My son ordered a salmon dish that had more noodles than it did fish, my husband ordered shrimp that was over battered and looked and tasted like frozen out of a box, I got the fish n chips and it had hardly any flavor to it other than salty, the tarter sauce was not very good.  Not to mention that non of their dinner dishes come with either soup or salad and it was quite pricey for just meals. 

I doubt I'd try it again after seeing everyone in the place with better dishes than we had and we knew nothing about what they served and what the others had didn't look like it came from their menu?"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and it was amazing. Our server was Sarah and she was very attentive and polite. Loved that she made some great suggestions since we weren't familiar with the menu. We had the calamari fries for an appetizer and it was delicious. The king crab legs were also very good. Great happy hour deals and great food. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was really a fan of the Crab Corner location on the East side, so I was super excited that they opened a place on my side of town! It is a little difficult to get to from the 215, but it is a gorgeous place. Full bar, all of the MD/Baltimore items,  flat screen tvs, and much larger. They also seem to offer more specials- lunch, happy hour, etc.

I just ordered takeout- a crab cake sandwich and an order of Boardwalk fries. I did think that it was a little pricey ($20), but the sandwich was delicious. It would probably benefit from mayo or some kind of sauce on it, but the crab cake was full of meat, nicely seasoned, and the bread was tasty too. The fries were just fine, nothing really to write home about. 

Hopefully I'll be able to return soon for a full meal here!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Groupon and it was a great surprise on how delicious it was. Our waiter was very helpful and recommended some dishes. I ordered the Alaskan king crab. It came at market price but was worth the price. My friend ordered the crab cake platter and loved it. The crab cakes were full of crab meat and not just breading. It's a great atmosphere and the whole staff was very attentive. Even if it wasn't their table they would check up on us and make sure we were good. Definitely highly recommended. You check this place out."}
{"text":"Not great; soft shell crabs over cooked; soup bland; servers distracted. Won't be going b"}
{"text":"Our party had the Fried Clams, Grilled salmon on pasta, & fried shrimp dinners.  All were good.  There's a Lot of pasta with the salmon.   A good place to eat.   When you have to wait for a table (was less than 30 min), you know a place is good"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh crabs...a little messy, but that's half the fun.  Try their $2 Tuesday specials if you are new to the little suckers and are unsure of yourself.  As long as you enjoy crab and don't mind a little work to get to the sweet crab meat, this is the place for you.

I recommend the Annapolis Crab Dip - super yummy!  Staff is very friendly, but cut them a little slack on Tuesdays when they're absolutely slammed.

For fresh live seafood, I think it's very affordable, but beware, they have so many tasty items that it's easy to get carried away...but worth it if you do."}
{"text":"Great  great find in las vegas. Their crabcakes are so good...as good, if not better, than any we have had in maryland. They have a great variety on the menu, too. This is a great restaurant. Clean and staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Make sure to call ahead if you're heading in for blue crab. We ordered some to take home. They were delicious as you'd expect from blue crab. Just very, very pricey. I had to spend nearly $80 on crab for just myself to be satisfied. The \"jumbo\" crabs were pretty tiny, so I can't imagine what medium or small looks like."}
{"text":"Great, chill atmosphere...best crab cakes west of the east coast ;) If you're a Ravens fan, you've found home :)"}
{"text":"Arrived the day an article posted in the RJ about Crab Corner, it was busy!! Really glad to see that our local businesses can prosper from an article like that. Now to the food.........

Unfortunately arrived too late in the evening (8pm'ish?) and they were out of the blue crabs. This did not stop me from fulfilling my crab craving however! 

Ordered the Soft Shell Crab platter with 2 sides(pictures up). Came with 3 deliciously(lightly) battered, seasoned in the classic JO seasoning, fried crabs with a pile of the boardwalk fries(peanut oil fried) and hush-puppies. Tasty!

Be prepared to get messy, thats the fun of eating crab, each table has a roll of paper towels, and you will use them! Not a great suggestion for a 1st date! (lol) 

They were busy and we did wait a bit for the food, but worth the wait. Everything had a fresh taste to it and reminded me of back home. If you are in the mood for some tasty little morsels then come here and beat that crab craving!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Website said open until 10. We got there at 8:45 and they wouldn't take our order. Young Philippine with shaved head promised if we would come back next day, the first round was on the house. We came back the next day... No free round with our purchase but the price was raised! $12 per crab... Supposed to be 7 inch crabs... They were rotten and all under 4 1/2 inches which is illegal to catch or sell. They also sell females which is also illegal. This place is ripping of customers and destroying the crab population"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 6 stars! I had an absolute blast here for my nephews Marvel themed surprise bday party. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. Ashley really made the day memorable. She went out of her way to ensure that we had a great time. Please stop in and pay her a visit!! You're in for a fun time!!"}
{"text":"I read these reviews about crab corner being expensive. Wrong! Got 14 med for $25. ( after tax) If you can find great fresh sweet blue crabs for under $1.78 let me know! Crab corner I heart you!"}
{"text":"A fun cheerful place to eat some crab and other seafood. The service was friendly and helpful.

The seasoning they use on their shrimp and crab was really good. And their catfish was very tasty too. Cooked very nicely.

Overall, definitely a good place to chow down on some well-prepared seafood."}
{"text":"Bumping up a star since my last visit- things are looking up! And the happy hour is still killer."}
{"text":"Always seen this restaurant while driving on Rainbow, love crab so of course I was curious about the food. Went after my sons baseball game and wasn't really sure what to expect. There was 6 of us so we ordered some apps, calamari, bacon wrapped scallops and oysters. By far the bacon wrapped scallops were the best and accompanied by an amazing sauce (not sure what it is but its absolutely delicious).

I ordered the peel and eat spiced shrimp and other than being fairly large sized shrimp nothing else really stood out about them. We also tried the crab cake sandwich which was a decent sized cake on a bun. The crab cake was very tasty. My son ordered the popcorn shrimp and I'm assuming he liked it because he ate it all up. 

The service was great. Everyone from the minute we walked in were very pleasent and attentive. It would be a good, chill place to watch sports games and enjoy some seafood."}
{"text":"I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  The crab cakes were not the best.  I know that I am not in Maryland but someone needs to go there to learn how to cook a Crab Cake.  I had 5 people in my party and when I received the bill, there was an 18% gratuity tacked onto the bill.  They also included the tax in the gratuity.  Anyone that has traveled or eaten out on a regular basis knows you don't receive a gratuity on the tax.  Well, I was informed that they automatically put a gratuity on 6 or more.  Duh, I had 5.  They also said that the machine calculates the gratuity.  Well, I won't be going back.  They can fix the gratuity but I doubt if they can make the food better.  I have eaten in some very fine restaurants that might add an automatic gratuity of 15 - 20%.  I was served with plastic forks.  I don't think this is a 18 percenter."}
{"text":"Awesome mimosa and Bloody Mary bottomless on Saturday 

Ashley was great always kept my drink full 


Thank you will be back soon"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews it seems like Crab Corner would have been absolutely amazing BUT it fell short. I ordered the crab cake sandwich and boardwalk fries, my hubby ordered the King Crab legs and the lobster bisque. We got there early (11:20a) but the guy (owner possibly) opening up was late so we were a little chilly standing outside until about 11:35. But he made up for it and got us two beers rather quickly.  The pros were his humor and professionalism, the food tasted overall good, 

The cons are the location (in an old mexican market plaza) and the place itself wasn't as visually pleasing. The food was good but definitely over priced. My seafood palette was thankful in the end. Will I go back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"The only disappointment I have ever had  at either location..........
Is when I look down and my plate is empty.  
The BEST Maryland style seafood this side  of Dundalk. 
I live for mom style potato salad."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this restaurant and saved it for a special meal.   Decided to use it this evening to treat my son at the end of his Christmas break.   Was close to home and I was hoping for some delicious seafood. My family loves seafood and we eat a lot of it.  The place is a hole in the wall but we were warmly greeted and well taken care of.   The guy's wanted calamari which I didn't want to order mostly because it was  $11.99 but I caved unfortunately.   It was a small amount of overly breaded fried scraps.   The taste wasn't too bad for crunchy scraps.   The owner made the mistake of asking us how it was.   Silence fell over the table me averting my eyes for a full minute then my husband just let it rip.  Honestly this is the worst calamari I ever ate.  He tried to make it up by bringing us a small order of fried oysters.  The flavor was okay but it was another basket of overly fried seafood.   I wanted to suggest some places he could visit to see what calamari should look and taste like.   2 ice tea's  $4.98 thank goodness the hubby drank water.   My son had fried oysters, hush puppies and onion rings.   More overly fried food but he liked it  $14.99.  Pasta Alfredo  $14.99 for the hubby and this tasted pretty good with lots of shrimp but not worth the price.   I had the crab cake just 1 $16.99.  There wasn't a lot of filler in it but it just didn't taste like the price.   I was expecting succulent juicy crab and it was pretty dry and blah. Hubby got a side of onion rings  $2.99.  Our bill was over  $91.00 before the  $25.oo Groupon.   For this kind of money we could have eaten at a really nice restaurant with delicious food.   I recommend if you have this kind of money to spend go somewhere else.   We will definitely not go back.   Three stars because the service was great."}
{"text":"The one place in Las Vegas that I crave for.  The one restaurant that I missed when I was living in Australia for one year.  Be prepared to work for your food and get a little messy!  Have fun! Walk in and the place is simply furnished But cushioned seats. Sports plays on the tvs. Some tables are shared between 2 parties. Paper covers the table so you can eat right off of it. Our server Bryce was very friendly, attentive, and really great overall.  My man drank beers and I had soda. They offered $1 oysters so we ordered 6.  I didn't care for these as they were larger than I prefer. My favorite starter is the creamy lobster bisque. Always has good bits of lobster in the thick and tasty soup.  I don't want any other kind of crab but blue crab when I come here. The bigger the better.  They have a great deal $2 blue crab on Tuesdays. Although I have never taken advantage of it.  It is enough work for me to get the meat out so I prefer as much meat as possible.  The females are great when it is the season for eggs.  I like the eggs and fat mixed in my rice.  Everyone does it different. I flip it to its under side.  Pull off all of the legs. Flip open the shell of the abdomen and remove it.  Stick the knife in the opening you've just made to separate the body from the big shell. Then using my knife I scrape off all of the gills and guts to toss away.  Then break the body in half to get the good stuff!   I save my wooden mallet for the claws.  I take a folded paper towel and place it over the claw before I hammer at it, to prevent flying shells. Sprinkle the old bay seasoning in my melted butter for dipping. Then to balance all the salt I enjoy my crab with steamed rice.  We shared a half dozen of large females today.  I felt they were a bit small for my appetite so we also ordered the little neck clams.   I love them smaller.  The flavor for me tends to be better.  So yumm!  They give you bread for dipping in it's seasoned garlic butter sauce.  Smells good too!  The nice thing about this crab spot is that the smell of seafood and seasonings doesn't linger on you in comparison to the Cajun style restaurants.  Our total for 2 people came out to around $78.  All my friends that I bring here love it. One exception is my girlfriend who refuses to get her hands messy."}
{"text":"Crab Corner has been my favorite spot in vegas for a long time. The manager who used to take care of us is no longer there.  I would have to say the vibe has gone down significantly.  Seems way more quiet.  The servers are much better though, with more sense of urgency. 

I always go for the female blue crabs. They are the best when their eggs are in season. Throw in some old bay seasoning into my butter... Yum!  
Little neck clams never disappoint. That garlic butter soaked up in the bread wow. 
Lobster bisque is nice and creamy. Never skimps on the lobster meat. 

I never go for oysters here... I've tried many times this just isn't the place for them. 

I'll always like the food here."}
{"text":"What a nice friendly place to eat! The indoor outdoor atmosphere is so relaxing!
The food was really good! And the prices are also very reasonable!
The staff is very knowledgeable of all the menu entrees!
I will definitely be eating here again soon!
Thank you Christie ....and John!!"}
{"text":"They food here is amazing... It was my second time there and it just as great as the 1st time I came.. All the food is fresh.. GREAT PLACE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife is from Maryland's eastern shore and we've enjoyed many bushel's of MD blue crab from the Chesapeake, but who would have thought you'd find those same high quality delights here in the desert.  The fries are remanencent of Thrasher fries from Ocean City.  The place isn't cheap, but it costs less than two tickets to MD!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice atmosphere, and staff. And you can't beat the happy hour deal..$1 oysters. That's ridiculous. I barely eat seafood and I'm hooked on this place and there steamed clams."}
{"text":"Sad to report. Inconsistent crab quality. Only 5 of the 13 x-large + large blue crabs that showed up at our table were acceptable. The rest had \"mushy\" meat in the body and legs. Inedible in my book. Not to mention this condition of crab meat will likely give you hives.

Depending on the season, I can buy a live 2 lb. dungeness crab from the Asian grocery store for anywhere between $8-$20. Suffering a pricey $$$ Crab Corner lunch tab on a non-special day will never happen again at this location.

At $8-$10 per Crab Corner blue crab, one would think you'd expect perfection. Yes, we worked it out so we only had to pay for our crab cakes (fishy tasting - probably leftover day-old crab) and oysters (not good either - read below) and 5 crabs... but because so many crabs were bad and the kitchen fixes the crabs to order, this lunch ended up being over 2.5 hours long. A total waste of our afternoon.

Oysters were on special ($1 each) but were ridiculously small. The owner-manager (AJ) described them as being \"Skipjack\" oysters. I'd never heard of a \"Skipjack\" oyster before in my life, and I've eaten thousands of oysters. A skipjack is an oyster boat, right? Whatever they actually were, they were tiny, not even good, and therefore not worth it. And they were shucked poorly as well - little bits of teeth-chipping shell were in almost half of the dozen I got.

I would avoid this location and revisit the Rainbow/215 location the next time."}
{"text":"There are only 3 things I order here, and I love them. Blue crabs, happy hour oysters, and happy hour beer. I don't mess with anything else. You'll notice that most of the 2-star Yelp reviews are from people who don't eat blue crabs. Blue crabs are what Crab Corner does best. I understand picking crabs isn't for everyone, but this is one of those places where you have to know what to order.

I'm a fan. But it's a real time consuming meal - figure about 8-10mins per crab. Don't miss $2 crab Tuesdays (regular size) and $3 crab Thursdays (large size). I've never done the all-you-can-eat Mondays ($24.99) there, because that could be big trouble timewise and healthwise. Picking crabs is hard on your fingertips, and I usually eat 7 or 8 in one sitting. I'm not full after 7 or 8 crabs, but at that point I do feel like taking a shower after that much cracking, splatting and sucking. Feeling rich? Get the jumbo size - a lot easier to pick and a lot more meat.

The $1 happy hour oysters from 2pm-6pm are usually a large variety like Chesapeake or Fannie Mae. Very tasty and a great deal. Draft beers are $3 during happy hour.

It could literally take you 2+ hours to eat here, picking and grinning the entire time. My best suggestion is to order at most 3 crabs per person at a time, so they stay hot. When starting on your last crab, put another order in."}
{"text":"COME HERE! SEE DAVID! HES THE BEST! 
The maryland crab was so fresh and juicy and delicious and incredible and yum yum yum. I went with some MD girls and I am a PA native myself. All 8 of us bachelorette party attendees had the best afternoon here. Honestly, it was the highlight of our entire weekend. The service is great and the food is amazing. 
We got 2 lbs of female crabs, 1 lb of shrimp, about 10 soft shell crabs (BEST IVE EVER HAD), hushpuppies, french fries, oysters.
We had tons of beer- Iron Horse I think its called- SO GOOD.

I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"I heard about their $1 oyster special on Sundays so came here to check it out. The oysters were decent sized and tasty. Came with the typical lemon, horse radish and cocktail sauce. They weren't the best but for $1 each... Totally worth it. For my entree, I had the crab cake sandwich. The food took a while to come out but when it finally did, I must say... I was pretty impressed. The crab cake was huge! It was a little bland but nothing a touch of ketchup and ranch can't fix. My mom got the soft shell crab sandwich. The crab on hers was huge too! She had to rip off the arms so that she could get a grip on the sandwich. We also ordered a side of French fries but they ran out so have us boardwalk fries (at no extra charge) instead. I would have preferred the regular fries because the boardwalk was too salty for me. Oh well. 

The restaurant is very open. Staff... Super friendly and welcoming. The one thing that really bugged me was the fact that the waiters take the orders on their cell phones. At first, I thought our waiter was in the middle of a text message, or tweet, or what have you... While taking our appetizer order. I was a little offended and felt very uncomfortable. When she came back to take our entree order, she bent down a little and that's when I realized she was punching in our order on her phone! I get that technology is the way to go nowadays but c'mon! It was such an awkward situation. My mom thought she was being extremely rude so I had to explain to her that she was just doing her job. I hope management realizes this and changes the way they take orders because if I had not seen her screen, I would have never known! 

Crab corner definitely has the potential for improvement. I'm gonna be coming here again sometime in the future and I would love to give them more stars. But for now, I'm sticking with a 3."}
{"text":"Excellent \"hands on\" blue crab experience. Use your mallet, plastic knife and fingers to get every crab morsel. Lots more on the menu to enjoy on multiple visits. A must go to place. Price per dozen depends on size of crabs. On Tues, only $2 per crab for regular size plus $2 bottles of domestic beer.
Not too many tables. Can wait 30mins to be seated then food takes a while to come out of the kitchen but your patience is highly rewarded."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant about a week and a half ago and were hoping for a nice night out. Me and my wife came in expecting to do the AYCE crab special that was on Monday nights. We came into the restaurant and it reeked of old bay seasoning and that bad fish smell you find in old markets. We weren't too upset by this, just figured it was part of the atmosphere. We ordered our food and had about 6-8 very small blue crabs dropped off at our table. We have never eaten crabs like this before and how no idea how to do it, but the waiter just left them there on the table and walked away. There was very little meat in the crabs and the act of ripping them open and seeing the \"gut mustard\" was absolutely disgusting and enough to ruin our appetite. We attempted to eat it and realized there was no way we would get full or even stomach it. The manager told us he would charge us for 6 of the crabs plus our appetizers and that he would bring us out some King Crab legs that we ordered instead. The crab legs were good but after our clothes and body were covered in crab juice and old bay seasoning, we weren't able to enjoy it from the stench that was burned into our nostrils.  We didn't expect what happened next, the waiter gave us our bill for $80 which included the crab we didn't even eat... What type of customer service is that? Especially in Las Vegas... I do not see this place surviving here long and definitely warn people to avoid it, not worth the time, money, or the amount of detergent it will take to get that smell out of your clothes."}
{"text":"Thank you for the karaoke you cut my mother and my mom's song off to sing your own song. As a DJ, if I screwed someone's song up I'd give them the next song up but no, you had to do your own even though I tipped you. Then the whole 6 people there you put in front of us. Last time for karaoke there. I've been doing this for years. I'm very let down."}
{"text":"service was good.

Food was just ok. They oysters are good deal for happy hour. The board walk fries didn't really wow me. Crabs were good."}
{"text":"I just came from Maryland two days ago for business. I had the best crab cake sandwich ever there in two different places. So I see yelp and this place that looked like they had a Maryland feel. Not even close to crab cake sandwiches in Maryland. Also the calamari fries were not seasoned at all, very tasteless. I know its a seafood restaurant, but as I walked in the aroma of spoiled seafood hit my nose.  Other yelp reviews complained about the service. I did not experience anything wrong with the service, it was fine to me, just the food didn't taste anything like it did in Maryland to me for the same prices. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mini Crab Cakes (8) $19.99

Steamer Sampler &49.99

My wife and I went here with a friend after church. Its located in a small mall plaza right after the zia record store on eastern. When we went inside, the setting was simple with a few tables, chairs, and decorations reflecting all things Maryland. The crab cakes were pretty good. It was a little on the salty side but the tartar sauce really helped calm that salty flavor down. Was it worth almost $20.00? Yes but only if you're craving fresh crab cakes as 20 bucks can go a long way here in Vegas. The steamed sampler contained cleaned blue crabs, corn, sausage, clams, and shrimp in a garlic, butter sauce. I wouldn't order the this again for 2 reasons. First, the sauce was on the watery side and thus gave the seafood no taste at all. And secondly, the crabs and shrimp did not come with the heads so pretty much the best parts of the seafood were missing. I will only come back here only for their crab cakes..."}
{"text":"sure was hoping for better.  mostly greasy and greasier fried food.  server was a bit up tight as i was there at 1:30pm and not much happening.  with less grease, more flavor from the good, and a better attitude......i might go back if i knew some changes had been made.  The cook was kind enough to ask me how the food was, so that was nice of him to do that.  i did not offer any input to him....doing it here.
much to be desired, but larger portions, and make sure that you know what you are ordering before the server leaves the table."}
{"text":"Dined for lunch here a few days ago.  Appetizer:   Mini crab cakes.  Delicious (once I added Old Bay seasoning). 
Entree:   Combo platter of fried shrimp & cod.  They were just ok.
Sides:   Onion rings ...   Just OK
             Potato Salad  ....   DELICIOUS, the                       
             best ever. Will go back just for the 
             potato salad. 
Will try the crabs next time !!! (With a big bowl of potato salad). 
Can you tell that I luv potato salad !!"}
{"text":"Only place to get Crabs in Vegas!!! I come at least twice if not three times a month and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"So My husband and I saw this place from Yelp and went to try. First,they didn't have any female crabs today, we ordered male crab - which means it won't have any eggs or a lot of sweet meat like a female one. Okay, that's fine, so we ordered Jumbo and Large Blue male Crabs.  However, the Jumbo was smaller than the Large size.. (even large was pretty small) Since our Jumbo was so small, the waitress brought us one more bigger size of crab later (we didn't ask for, she just brought one more and we really appreciated). The service was very nice. But the crabs were pretty bad. I felt like I spent $60 dollars to eat the SHELLS...  [I guess if you go there during the happy hour, it's different story].
Anyways, we had to order a Lobster roll (sandwich) so we don't get grumpy after we eat in this place. However, they didn't have sweet potato fries... so they gave us some kind of chips which tasted like a week old... so we didn't eat that. Lobster roll was okay, but for $20 dollars, I won't ever order it again. Very salty and taste not that fresh.. 
Overall, the service was good, the concept of this business was okay, but food was horrible in my opinion. You could go to other cajun crab/seafood places with the same price for better quality.."}
{"text":"We went to the Eastern/Flamingo location Wednesday evening...12/3/14, first of all the server placed the menu on the table with out saying a word and left for at least 10 miniutes. The place only had 2 other tables that had customers at them. Right then I expected the worst and that came to be....we ordered 1 dozen large females and 1/2 dozen jumbo females...the jumbos where exactly the same size as the large females when I say large and jumbo I am talking about crab corners sizing which are really small and medium if ordering in Baltimore or other areas of MD....I am ok with that, I know what to expect with crab corners' sizing. But for the Jumbo price I do expect at least extra large crabs. 

The crabs did taste great and were full as in the past visits. We have been getting crabs here since they first opened...The past few times the service has been just shy of horrific ...that night the waiter did not come back after dropping off the crabs to see how things were or to  refill our sodas...my granddaughter refilled ours as needed.

One other thing I need to mention, we ordered one bowl of soup and boardwalk fries for starters .....the soup never came and the fries arrived the same time as the crabs.

I have met the owners when they first opened and they were very attenitive to their business and taking care of the customers. I am only writing this that they may wake up and smell the coffee before their hired help runs them out of business.

It will be a long time before I or my family give the crab corner another try if ever."}
{"text":"My woes began when I tried to order online through grub hub for delivery ($7 off for 1st timers) and the lobster roll and lobster grilled cheese weren't listed (the only two items I wanted). 

I should have left it alone then and there but being persistent I called in and ordered to go (foregoing my $7 off).

I arrived and there were only two parties seated, in a Ravens bar, on Sunday. Not what I was expecting.

I paid $46 for two sandwiches and a crab pretzel and sped home with lunch.....only to open the crab pretzel which smelled like the ocean. 

The lobster roll had an ample amount of lobster, crunch bread, and an underwhelming amount of flavor (sad face), for $20!!!! 

The other sandwich had a great sauce and good bread but the fried oysters, fish and shrimp themselves had no flavor at all.

My stomach wasn't happy a few hours later and neither was my wallet, but as a Steelers fan, this is what I get for going into enemy territory. I tried."}
{"text":"My first visit to crab corner. We ordered calamari  (best calamari I have ever had the Chipotle sauce is amazing ) snow crab legs (seasoned and cooked to perfection) spiced peel and eat shrimp  (seasoned perfectly) by far the best seafood in vegas for a great price"}
{"text":"We were in a dream stream of crab heaven. We're from the bay area and eat crab regularly, we forgot that they go out of season, so for the last two weeks we've been craving crab. Who would have thought Vegas we'd find our crab meca! We got the garlic steam pot with pounds of crabs boiled in garlic broth and it was amazing! Our waiter Evon was a great friendly server too. Thanks for the feast!"}
{"text":"If you love seafood you would appreciate this restaurant. It is the closest to Maryland style seafood located in the desert. The crab cakes were very filling and if you order it, one is enough. It was majority lump crab meat (crab cake lovers appreciate that). I was so excited for crab cakes I ordered 2 with blue crab, corn on a cob, and hush puppies. I was stuffed but very satisfied. 

The prices are a little higher for blue crab but it's expected being in Las Vegas--no ocean (imported seafood daily). 

This restaurant has two locations. I went to the location closer to the strip (10 min. drive), easy to find. I was surprised to see the store front, it looked more like a take out restaurant but we went in anyway and I'll definitely go back for a meal again."}
{"text":"Although the service was Great the food and prices fell very short. $12.99 for 4 quarter size (bite size) crab cakes is not fulfilling! C'mon guys give us what we, The \"customers\" pay for! We also ordered onion rings and headless shrimp, onion rings were ok (but still a bit over priced) the shrimp was really dry and bland for $11-$12 for half a lb. First and last time dining here for sure."}
{"text":"After seeing the good reviews on Yelp, my wife and I recently decided to give Crab Corner a try.

They specialize in blue crab but were out the day we stopped by. So we decided to split a soft shell crab platter, crab dip, and fried calamari.

The soft shell crab was good but maybe a tad overcooked. For our sides we got hush puppies and corn on the cob. The hush puppies were pretty good but the corn was cold in the center. Since it's winter the corn had likely been frozen. It could have used a few more minutes in the boiling water.

The crab dip was pretty good. It had nice big chunks of crab and was served on slices of baguette. The owner told us it was his grandma's recipe.

We both enjoyed the fried calamari which was served with a good marinara dipping sauce.

We got free sodas with our Yelp check-in. Free is always good.

The owner came over while we were eating to see if we were enjoying our meal. He was very friendly and down to earth. He told us he's been crabbing since he was 15. For the last several years he's been the main crab supplier to local seafood markets and recently decided to open up a restaurant with his brother.

When we asked about the blue crab, he explained that the water is too cold right now so the crabs are all staying in the mud, but he's been watching the weather reports and anticipated he'd have more blue crab in a few days. He definitely seemed to be knowledgeable and passionate about crabs.

I would give the food 3 stars. I'm giving an extra star for the fact that this is a locally owned place with an owner who seems very committed to serving quality food.

I definitely plan to return and try the blue crab."}
{"text":"Great place, I had the Garlic Steamer Sampler and it was fantastic.  Service was fast and professional, I even had my ice tea refilled without asking.  I highly recommend to anyone who lives or is visiting Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out ,fish an chips  , clams ,shrimp, they forgot the french fries , the clams leaked all over the bag cause the box was put on top, the shrimp really had no flavor,  i do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here but I was sadly mistaken.  I only gave it two stars because the fries and the hush puppies were good. My boyfriend and I ordered a soft shell crab sandwich, NOT expecting literally two little crabs fried put on some sandwich buns. I am mostly writing this review because I am really displeased with their service. Maybe it is my mistake for not saying anything but if you notice that your table has literally taken one bite out of their sandwich and hasn't ate anything else off the plate and you still make them pay full charge without even offering to swap it out for something else or maybe discount it.. that is rude. It is obvious we did not like our food, when you came to give us our check our plates were still full and denied a to go box... that should have told you something right there. Again, perhaps it was our mistake for not saying something but if I were in the food industry and I noticed the table wasn't touching their food I would gladly offer them something else or a discount for their inconvenience. It was $45 even with happy hour items. Such a disappointment. It should really be called the \"crap corner\"."}
{"text":"Off the beaten track and a $15 cab ride from the strip but worth every penny. The homemade, fresh apricot chutney with horseradish and fresh pepper was  outstanding with a perfect pairing of sweet and heat. It paired nicely with the bacon wrapped scallops. The atmosphere was casual and reminded me of a roadside diner. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Prices reasonable. All around great experience."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last went here but the experience was so unforgettable I just have to write this. So we went for blue crab and they were OUT. Ordered another crab n they were OUT! So I ordered their king crab n it was overcooked! Super salty! The staff was very rude! Horrible service, horrible food, spent way too much money for such a horrible experience. Never gone back since!"}
{"text":"If your hungry for crab or shrimp you must go here. Whenever I'm in Vegas I never forget to come here. They serve the best food and their service is perfect. It's great to find a perfect place that makes me want to go time and time again. I have yet to find anything comparable to here. Thanks"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish there was one on the Northwest side of town, closer to where we live. Hint, hint... Hahaha. But, it's always worth the drive. We only went in for some oysters during the happy hour and Ashley our bartender kicked it up a notch for us. She was a riot. So much fun. A Bloody Mary, a few beers and oyster shooters and it was a good time.  Anyways, the oysters on the 1/2 shell were fresh and so delicious. They are a dollar a piece during HH. We also had the boardwalk fries, calamari fries and lobster bisque. The boardwalk fries were so good. Fresh cut fries, fried in peanut oil and seasoned with bay seasoning. Yum. The calamari fries were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And the lobster bisque was rich and creamy. Actually had little chunks of lobster in it. Thank you Ashley for showing us a good time and for being our \"bad influence\", in a good way, of course. Until next time!"}
{"text":"First time here... Ordered oysters, 15 @ $1.00 a piece, crab cakes, and blue crabs... I'll let you know later...."}
{"text":"I am truly head over heels in love with Crab Corner!! Seafood is my absolute favorite food and I've found it hard to find an affordable, chill, seafood restaurant in Vegas. Until now!! I've been here twice so far the first time just a quick bite raw oysters and the lobster bisque. So good! The next time we all went as a group my parents, my daughters, my hubby and I. We all decided to try out the blue crabs and raw oysters. So amazingly tasty!! The server let us know what the deal of the day was and he was even nice enough to go into detail and show us how to eat them! They are messy but worth every sweet and savory bite! Definitely try Crab Corner you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After finding this place through our trusty Yelp, my family and I decided to give this place a try.  

Since this place specializes in blue crab, we decided to order a dozen medium sized blue crabs.  There are several sizes to chose from: small, medium, large, and jumbo.  If you're not sure what size to opt for, sample sizes are posted on a board along with the price of each size.  The prices are per dozen and range from $29-$99.  They also give you the option of choosing between male or female crabs.  The crabs were perfectly seasoned and I love the fact that they have vinegar as a dipping sauce.  They also have melted butter.  

We also ordered 2 pounds of crawfish, hushpuppies, calamari, and boardwalk fries which were all tasty."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I came here last week and we are still raving about it! The atmosphere is fun and friendly. I believe all the guys that work in there are either owners or their friends. They're very helpful when  ordering too. We ordered the medium blue crabs, which were cooked to perfection!  One of the guys gave us a tutorial on how to eat them. It was a  lot of fun! They were so juicy and sweet! And the seasoning they put on it is outstanding! We also had the spicy shrimp and the boardwalk fries, which I would also order again. Definitely will be going back there again very soon. There are so many things I want to try. Overall, food was great, price were good. they had a good selection of beer, and above all the staff rocks!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. Not worth the money. Tuesday special ran out when I got there at 8pm. Don't go!"}
{"text":"$15 bottomless mimosas brunch special is great, service is good, food is sub-par. We had fish and chips, fried clams and some of the $1 fresh oysters from the happy hour menu, not horrible but none of it tasted fresh...but the mimosas, can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting Las Vegas and were looking for a place to eat off the strip.  We found the Crab Corner based on another internet review and, seeing the number of positive reviews posted, decided to go ourselves.  We expected to find a fancy restaurant and had actually called to make reservations (I have to laugh at that now!).  Instead we found this unassuming little place on the corner of a strip mall.  Nothing fancy at all.  In fact, it looked a bit seedy from the outside, but we decided to dive in  and go \"local.\"  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young waiter in a \"I GOT CRABS IN LAS VEGAS\" T-shirt.  He was very friendly and gave us a corner seat.  The tables were totally plain with a set of condiments for each.  He took our order for drinks and another waiter came and took our order for food.  On his iPhone.  This was in itself awesome--the order was wired to the cooks before the waiter even left the table!  The waiter was funny and helpful, and even photobombed a pic I shortly took of my wife and me at the restaurant!  I posted it to FB right away :-)  We got the crab cakes which, as other reviewers wrote, were some of the best I've ever had--all crab.  The clam strips were fantastic and actually had real clam strips within instead of the usual nothing-but-fried-stuff with a clam residue.  The fried fish was excellent and my wife, a Texan, couldn't help but repeatedly comment how she could taste the beer in the batter.  The portions were not monstrous--they would be normal--and I ordered another plate of clam strips simply because I'd never had any so good.  We were so happy with the experience that I bought a T-shirt from the place then and there. We are sworn repeat customers.  

PS: I was momentarily afraid after we left because I had stuffed myself on fried food, a massive \"no-no\" for dinner time as I then suffer bad indigestion all night long.  Call it coincidence or call it some sort of \"quality\" frying, but I did not have any problems sleeping with a belly full of fried Crab Corner food :-)

Check this place out and really enjoy the small cafe atmosphere.  You will not regret it!

Thanks for an excellent night Crab Corner!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is extremely slow. If you don't have 2 hours, don't go. I had crab cakes, but took over two hours to order, eat and receive the bill."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner! Great service will be back ... lobster dinner 2 Sides $21.99 are u kidding me!"}
{"text":"We went here because some friends/family suggested that it was good. The place is located near the 215 and has easy access. We went around 5pm on a Friday night and it was easy to get a table still. The place is relatively loud however so don't expect to have any easy conversations. 

First off, the food is good but nothing to write home about. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like but we've been to steakhouses or non seafood restaurants that had better fish. I got the soft shell crab sandwich which doesn't come with any side so I ordered onion rings, and my wife got the King crab legs and a $3 happy hour beer. We shared a crab cake platter which comes with two very small sides. All of this came out to $75 with tax which in our opinion was far overpriced. 

The real disappointing part of this place is the service. We did get seated quickly but then we didn't really see our waiter the whole time. He and and took our order and then just disappeared. Also, they delivered people's food to the table uneven leaving some eating and some still waiting for the I food for quite awhile. When we finally got our checks, the wrong items were on our checks and it took forever to get someone over to take the checks. 

Long story short, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I gave the Crab Corner 5 stars because of the taste and authenticity of the food. I came to Vegas about 12 years ago from Baltimore and the only thing I really missed about Maryland was the crab cakes and crab soup and the Ocean City fries. 

I visited the Crab Corner for the first time today and was elated to find all my favorite dishes just as good as I remember them from when I lived in Maryland. It was like going back in time for me.

The crab soup was delicious, but it came with a 1/2 of a small crab in the shell in the cup which takes up too much space and I think is something they do in Baltimore for the tourists. I asked for the soup without the shelled crab and it was perfect! My only gripe is that it came in a Styrofoam cup. I would have much preferred a real bowl and a real soup spoon instead of the regular size plastic spoon and plastic cup that they provided.

The crab cake was delicious and perfectly broiled. It was full of Jumbo Lump crab meat with very little filler. They served it on a hamburger roll with lettuce and tomato. In Baltimore I used to get my crab cakes served with saltines. I prefer them that way. Many people prefer deep fried crab cakes, but I wasn't offered an option. It didn't matter to me since I prefer them broiled. I do wish they offered a larger crab cake. They serve a 1/3rd lb. which is kind of small. Several places in Baltimore used to serve \"baseball sized\" 1 lb. crab cakes. They were the best!

I forgot how good \"Ocean City\" fries were. I guess I just took them for granted until I moved away and now all french fries that I get seem pretty bland. I think the main difference is that they are fried in peanut oil. Anyway, It was great to taste genuine Ocean City fries again.

They also offer steamed hard shell crabs which I haven't seen anywhere since I left Maryland. I used to enjoy them, but they are real messy and require a lot of effort to pick them properly, especially the small ones. They are also not cheap! 

My bill for a small crab cake, a bowl of crab soup and a medium serving of fries was $26 which is kind of high for a lunch at a very casual restaurant in a strip mall far from the strip. Even though it was pricy, I'll be going back as often as possible. I know how good authentic Maryland seafood is and I've really missed it!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome staff!! Ashley the bartender is great she really gets into with the customers and she knows how to make you feel great and part of the crowd. I love this place"}
{"text":"I went to this place around 11:35am and the door sign say open 11:30am I tried to open the door and it's still locked but workers are already inside just looking at me i waited for them to open the door but did not. One star!"}
{"text":"We concur! It was delicious. Medium crab is a little tedious,but great tasting. Can not wait to try the jumbo size. It was fun!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and so was the service.

The staff is so patient, friendly, and attentive.

The soups are really good, and so were the crab cakes. Wish I lived in the area to be able to go back to try out the steamers!"}
{"text":"Considering that we arrived at 8:54pm and not knowing that they close at 9:00pm...we were treated very well.  The guys welcomed us in and didn't rush us out at any point. We ordered the battered shrimp, coleslaw, rice, salad and a few beers.  The shrimp were just perfect...they were the right size, the right portion, the right amount of batter and really great tasting.  We will definitely be back to this joint."}
{"text":"Fell in Love with the Crab Corner the moment I walked through the door. The bartenders here really know how to take care of people. Especially Sam! Started off with the $1 oysters on hour happy hour and some fries. The oysters were amaze zen! The fries were cooked to perfection and the seasoning was bombtastic! Mini crab cakes were a little piece of heaven with every bite. The crab was so fresh and tasted like no other crab I have tasted before. The gaming was great my friend won and I had a good time sitting on my machine for awhile. Once dinner rolled around I ordered the Catfish with corn and hush puppies. The cat fish was sensational! The hush puppies were the best I have ever had. The corn was so fresh and so bursting with flavor. Love the kosher Old Bay seasoning the bartender provided me with. All the beers were great and they had a great bar setup with plenty of booze to fill our needs. Cannot wait to come back here. Thank you to all staff that made this a joyous and memorable experience. 

P.s. Garlic green beans were on point!"}
{"text":"Great \"local\" joint off the strip. It actually was not touristy and made me feel more comfortable after having spent a couple days indulging as a tourist on the strip. 

We got a dozen of the small crabs for $30. The seasoning up top was great. The crab meat was flavorful and soft. 

The hush puppies were awesome little cornbread rounds that had small pieces of onion that kept the interior moist while the exterior had a nice crust. 

I would return."}
{"text":"My husband & I visiting Las Vega$, he wants seafood, I do a search & find this place.  We were overjoyed finding blue crab, crab cakes, etc, menu fantastic.  Not disappointed. The crab cakes full of crab, not fillers, tasty, loved them. The environment simple, laid back. We sat in the bar area, Mothers Day it was packed. So bar area, they put the brown paper down for the messes.  Soft shell platter outstanding (per hubby).  If you are looking for east coast crab, this is the joint. I'm not sure what else to put, if you love seafood - get your appetite here.  Make reservations just in case."}
{"text":"went with a groupon or living social and was surprised on how good it was, had fish and chips, but next time I will have the crab, very friendly, great service, far price and very local vibe"}
{"text":"We came when visiting Vegas to watch a Ravens game. Great service and great food!  I got the crab soup and fries, was with a group of 10 who all got food and everyone enjoyed their meal. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Nice gem, off strip, good crab dip, crabby Cobb salad, lobster bisque, and blue crab."}
{"text":"Great Late Night Seafood Joint!

Seafood was phenomenal. Seevice was outstanding (Sam)!  We had steamed clams in garlic butter to start and then followed it with some Alaskan King crab, coleslaw, and hush puppies.  Everything was great. Great place for late night seafood."}
{"text":"It must have been a bad day when I went last month, because it was terrible! We ordered a dozen jumbo, but at 2PM they had none. We settled for extra large( and they tried to charge us the jumbo price). The crab were very small, and were so wet they were a real mess to eat. Crab were not meaty at all and sour in taste!
Do yourself a favor and skip this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a native Baltimore boy living in the Midwest, and trips back east are few and far between.  I actually read about the Crab Corner and a Vegas message board, and thank goodness I did.  This is a real Maryland Crab House...as good as it gets.  I've been there my last 2 trips a total of 6 times (in a total of 10 total days) and I'd have gone more if my schedule allowed.  I always start with the Maryland Crab soup....perfect blend of spice and crab- it's a home run.  Then I move to the crab cake sandwich.  Perfection.  Lump crab meat, big enough that one is enough (but if you got the platter, you wouldn't be disappointed!)...and for what you get, the prices are more than right.  I have taken my girlfriend there and she raved about the fried oyster sandwich, and I took my best friend there (a native as well) and we felt like we were home.  It's a very unassuming place, but the entire staff is friendly and helpful.  Always a steady crowd...support this place- it's worth the drive (only a few miles off the strip) and worth your time."}
{"text":"Awesome menu and fresh crabs! Manager is real cool as well.
Love their Tuesdays $2 blue crabs and $2 domestic bottles"}
{"text":"the hush puppies are the best ive ever had...oysters super fresh and good...had cod and fries for my entre and it was normal quality and small size I felt for the price. this place has a very original atmosphere and d√©cor for las vegas standards and was a nice place to be for dinner and cool people watching when they get a massive dump of crabs on their table...there were a few moments looking at the menu that I thought \"that item will get me back here next time to try\". I would like to do an afternoon bender at the bar for a football game and see how many oysters and Jameson's I can handle. people were very attentive and friendly, you can tell they are not full of themselves and want to make sure that if customer doesn't come back its not because of bad service. I really struggled with giving them 5 stars over 4 but I want them to stay hungry to find a way to keep their quality up where it is and not raise their price or maybe lower it a little. also, portions could be bigger...cod is an entry level price fish and is abundant. bigger pieces please. for myself and my wife it was $45 with tip and no alcohol and no crabs. will take a little financial planning to get here couple times a month like i would like and that is a sad thing."}
{"text":"Maryland seafood in the heart of Las Vegas? Yes it's true and the food is fresh and delicious.

Crab corner is a popular seafood style Restuarant that's more like a sports bar. But Serving seafood simply isn't enough for them, so on Tuesdays & Thursday's they have the seafood special where whole crabs are just $2 each on Tuesdays and $3 on Thursdays. They also serve chilled beers for $2 as well. What a steal for the price!! That's not all, they have delicious complementary side dishes like chunky potato salad, sweet potato tater totes. But the two popular dishes that I couldn't get enough of was the lightly fried and well seasoned calamari and the crab dip. 

Imagine being temporarily transported from the hot Vegas sun to the cool waterfront of Maryland with the smell of old bay seasoning lingering in the air. Sounds delightful and although it's not decorated to my liking as a sports fan (this place is covered in Ravens memorabilia). The staff and fun make up for it.

So get there early because this place fills up fast and can become a long wait. Ask them to go light on the old bay because it can be to much at times. But once you get settled this place is fun and entertaining with huge TV screens located on the wall. But more importantly full from endless seafood."}
{"text":"We Love Crab Corner! Delicious Crab Cakes and My  Husband Loves the Lobster Roll. Great selection of beers and we love hanging out on the patio!"}
{"text":"Our first visit we loved this place enough to go back a second time and thinking  it would become our new date night place until....we ordered the crab and was quickly disappointed that everything except the onion rings was over salted to the point we had to wipe off the seasoning salt with a wet paper towel.
We tried to enjoy this expensive meal: 1 order of french fries, 1 order of onion rings, 2 orders of crab, 2 beers for $85.00.  
When asked how we were enjoying our meal we told them that we could barely eat it with all the salt. one server told us that he asked them to cut down on the salt the other server told us to next time order it without the seasoning and oh! you didn't know it comes that way...
Well, next time we're not coming your way crab corner."}
{"text":"Just left CRAB CORNER after wanting to try it for 2 yrs. When we walked in we saw a table of endless crab piled high, however, since breakfast wasn't hours and hours ago for us, we decided on appetizers. WRONG CHOICE TO MAKE..
 I started w/the Maryland Crab soup which tasted exactly like it came from a can. I had two bites and couldn't tolerate the \"can\" remnants left on my tongue. Slowly (very slowly) our 3 appetizers came out to the table by two (the only two) waiters in the place who would play a video game each and every time they passed the large, out of place, golf game. As my  Pepsi cup sat empty, I watched as both waiters made direct beelines for the game at every opportunity they could- which was about every 30 seconds....
 So, out came our  undercooked Scallops wrapped in  beyond burnt bacon, our Calamari fries that did not taste or look anything comparable to Calamari, and the Crab cakes- which were the ONLY food we had that we both actually enjoyed....
  I would ONLY come back to try their Mon special which is endless crabs piled on the table.. I grew up on Long Island, and we LOVEd to go crabbing- so when family comes into town we will go back for the CRABS ONLY...... CRABS and soda- that's it..........
  Good luck folks........"}
{"text":"Everytime we go here, we would always get their crab chowder, it is so decadent and the lumpy crab meat makes it so so good. So far we have always had blue crab, the oysters are fairly fresh and their Wednesday  lobster special is a great price for fresh lobster."}
{"text":"What up Crab corner... Really enjoyed myself here ! The food was delicious , cream of crab soup was on point! The atmosphere was relaxed and attentive. The bar tender ( Ashley ) was very cool and super nice. My drink was always full :) , i would definitely come back for sure. If you want some Maryland love in LV def come here... Don't miss out on the gem in LV ! Great food all around !"}
{"text":"Delicious crab, crab cakes, and Maryland crab soup.  Excellent boardwalk fries and hush puppies.  Personal and funny service.  Will become a regular!"}
{"text":"I've always been more of a bbq connoisseur until the past several months.  As I've opened my palate to genuine seafood (Crabs, oysters, etc) I've become very particular on where to eat and how the food is prepared.  Of the few seafood places in Vegas to eat and the many I've tried while traveling the country, Crab Corner is easily the best.  The atmosphere, food and genuine people that work there is second to none.  

I could fill up this review with many more positives and no negatives but I would rather keep it short and let you know...

...GO TO CRAB CORNER!!!!  You are guaranteed a great time and will make it back whenever you have a craving for seafood.  I'm sure you'll show this restaurant off to your friends when they come in town; I know I will!"}
{"text":"The crab pretzel is one of the greatest food items I have ever consumed. It is truly brilliant! 
So with that said, the beginning of our experience here was fantastic
BUT!
Everything after that was very very very subpar. We ordered the blue crabs and they were so OVERCOOKED, it seemed like someone poured a smoothie into a crab shell. But again, we wanted to see if things could get better. 
We next ordered two sandwiches since we were worried to order any other hard shell crab. 
The sandwhich I ordered was very subpar. There was nothing special about it and it was like they just put crab on a hamburger bun
The sandwich my mom go I did not look as appetizing as mine as it looked like shrimp was mixed with mayonnaise and thrown on a hamburger bun. 

Will not be back most likely."}
{"text":"This covers multiple visits -- the most recent is the only reason this is not 5 stars -- some of the food was a little over done and over seasoned. My fries were over salted and the Brussels were very overcooked. The lobster bisque is delicious, the crabcakes are awesome. I highly recommend the fish and chips, just swap the boardwalk fries for sweet potato fries, you'll be much happier. Previous trips have been amazing for service but this time lacked a little. We had a wonderfully attentive young man helping us, who was not even our server, that kept us from feeling extremely offput. Of course I'll be giving them another chance but I hope consistency picks up a lot more the next time."}
{"text":"I had the soft shell crab platter, and felt it was breaded waaaaay too much. I couldn't really taste any crab. I also had the calamari as an appetizer...nothing special. The portion is quite large though. Overall, I was more satisfied eating at The Boiling Crab than this place."}
{"text":"We come here relatively often. Consistent food and laid back ambiance. Originally from Northern Virginia I get a hankering for the food I grew up on and this hits the spot. Blue Crabs yummo but I really like the steamed clams with boardwalk fries to dip in - hence the profile pic."}
{"text":"This was a great surprize in Vegas. i am from - MD/VA and so missed the crabs with old bay seasoning and I got it all here! Including blue crabs! Jeremy is my server and he was excellent! I would recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood. I wondeful surprize place on rainbow blvd. You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon deal, unfortunately they won't alloy us to sit on the same table if you want to redeem more than 1 groupon. 
Food was good but not extraordinary, regular casual sea food place with reasonable price"}
{"text":"We're from out of town and got stranded around this area and I'm soooo glad we did! This place is delicious:) the $1 happy hr oysters were decent and the food was great. Definitely coming back here when I'm in town. Ohh p.s our server  Richard was super cool and laid back made us feel welcomed...thank you!!"}
{"text":"This was an extremely good meal for the price. It actually does taste like Maryland seafood. The lobster bisque was the soup of the day which was delicious! Everything is served on platic ware, except for the crab which is dumped in the middle of the table. Of course the table is covered with brown paper. I wish they had one of these back home in Ga."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had mixed feelings about the place but last night I had one of the best sandwiches in my entire life. No exaggeration.

I ordered the fried oyster poboy and it was superb. No other way to describe it. They were huge meaty oysters and the chef didn't cheap out on me, the sandwich was loaded from front to back. It was absolutely amazing.
I found myself wanting to order a second immediately after.

This restaurant doesn't just do crab right, it does seafood right."}
{"text":"I love crab corner, both locations. Easily the best seafood outside of the strip. Definitely get the male blue crabs but try the oyster poboy and the fries."}
{"text":"I grew up on the east coast and have been eating steamed blue crabs every summer since I can remember.  The clue crabs here are flown straight from Maryland to their steamers.  The quality is the same as anything I have had on the east coast.  I have had steamed crabs, crab cakes, and the crab soup here and everything was top notch.  I would recommend dining there on Tuesdays as other reviewers have mentioned for $2 crabs and $2 beers.  This restaurant is a no frills seafood place with fresh food and friendly service.  For the seafood lover or anyone from Maryland nostalgic for the real thing, Crab Corner is the place to go.  If you prefer to have your crab feast at home, they are more than happy to sell you live crabs as well."}
{"text":"What to say??? Mm 

THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS??


I got a dozen oysters... The oysters were yummy 

I also got the crab legs they were yummy!!!! 

But the service not good the girl looks like she hates her life seriously !!!! The dude all he did was be on his cell phone ....... I had to wait for my other beer... They don't give u wipes or anything for ur hands after ur done eating? 

The food is good they need new waiters"}
{"text":"I think what they need to work on is putting the brown sheet of paper on the table before seating you so they don't need to ask us to lift our cups and utensils all the time other than that food is good and service is ok."}
{"text":"My experience  st CrabCirner was ok
I've stopped by twice now
The waiters are great  and they explain the menu 
I'll visit again. I enjoy good sea food had the Blue Crab combo
Tell the staff to be open minded to its Guest 
We re  only visiting didn't come to stay
Also make sure  the condiment  bottles are wiped off 
Overall I enjoyed my visit"}
{"text":"So much deliciousness!!!!! I wish I had the capacity to eat more because everything was so good! 

I was born and raised in Maryland so it's a big deal when I get to have a taste of home all the way on this side of the country. 

AJ was our server and he was the best! He promptly greeted us when we came in. He had our drinks and order out in perfect time. He introduced the specials and the menu to our friends that were new to the restaurant. 

We had ice cold beers, soda, and waters.  We ordered the steamed crabs- perfect
crab cake sandwich- so good. Generous size and amazing taste
French fries- just like Boardwalk fries
lobster bisque- my husband licked the bowl clean
Cream of Crab soup- my favorite
Onion rings- loved them 
Brussel sprouts- I really had to pull AJ aside to get the secret recipe. They are the best I've ever had!
Hush puppies- I would have tried one, but my daughter devoured them.  They must have been delicious

Thank you, Crab Corner for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"We've been customers of Crab Corner since their original location first opened. Unfortunately we had in undesirable experience on a recent visit. I reached out to the owner to address the issue. *****5 STARS***** My goddess! Our issue was rectified almost immediately! I am in awe of how professionally they handled the situation. I will definitely return! How could I not? I've always loved the food here. I've always received great customer service for all these past years. And now I see that they truly value their customers."}
{"text":"The effin service sucks!! All 3 servers were rude, never smiled and when I would ask for something they would just walk away.. I would never come back to this place.. Crab is so salty n what I said b4 SERVICE SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had heard wonderful recommendations of Crab Corner on Rainbow at Sunset.....so we went on Wednesday, June 8, 2016.....the staff was very friendly and helpful, unfortunately it seemed the second string was cooking that evening; king crab legs tasted precooked, salted to keep fresh and re-heated to serve us...we sent them back, they washed the salt off and returned them to our table....jumbo crab cake wasn't and was very greasy, as were the fries and onion rings; the fried soft shell crab also tasted pre-cooked and re-heated...and were mushy.....blackened mahi-mahi was OK, but over-cooked....salads, dressings and soups were also unremarkable......may have been a bad day....maybe we'll try again....."}
{"text":"We ordered crab soup, two male crabs, six female crabs, rice, spice vinegar, and later, half a basket of fresh shrimp.  The female crabs were thin and watery, and lacking the buttery eggs that make them delicious.  We should have ordered just male crabs, since they are meatier.  Crab soup was excellent, shrimp was fresh and delicious, service was good. End of the Maryland crab season notwithstanding, the crabs did not deliver, and since this is a crab house, they're pulling down my rating."}
{"text":"Mimosas and crab cakes!!! So amazing!!! Jeremy hooked it up!! Much obliged!! We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went there this Saturday afternoon, with high hope for great food.  Once we walked in some of my excitement started to fade, the decor was tired and looked a bit dirty, the staff, although super nice were hard to recognize.  

We ordered a crab meat appetizer, the crab cakes platter, with hush puppies and slaw and lobster. The food was amazing!!!  

Left totally happy, four starts is for decor."}
{"text":"I was really sad to see Three Tomatoes and a Mozzarella go out of business, but excited to see a new restaurant go in. This is a really great layout, I absolutely love the outside/inside bar and patio area. The restaurant is pretty big inside with lots of TV's (they had the football games on when we were there, most people at the bar were watching). 

The menu had so much to choose from, we spent more time debating on what to get than your average customer. So the plan was to get a couple things and share. This was our order:

Lobster bisque- awesome, prob one of the best I've had, tasted like I was at a strip restaurant. Not too much sherry, and the broth was delish. 

Crab Cakes- outstanding. About 90% crab (real crab) and not too much breading. Sauce is excellent too. 

Alaskan Cod and Fried Sea Clams-cod was excellent and I loved you could get a hint of the beer in the batter. 

Soft Shell Crab-so good! Batter was good, didn't take away from the taste of the crabs. 

Sides-
*Hushpuppies were the best I've had (better than the ones I recently had in North Carolina) Not dry at all and had a good seasoning. 
*Sweet potato fries (can't really mess those up)
*Coleslaw was good but it was a tad warm, needs to be a lot colder. 
*Potato salad wasn't the best I've had, a little on the plain side. 

I definitely want to come back and try some of their cocktails and sit outside on their patio. They had an good specialty cocktail list. 

My only gripe is, I loved the crab cakes, I just think $28 was a bit steep for them."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent. We ate the seafood sampler. It was huge! It's good enough for 3 people. My favorite is the dungenous crab."}
{"text":"The food was good? I don't know. For what we spent ($110 before tip for Garlic Steamer Sampler, 2 Blue Claw crabs and 2 beers) I should have been impressed. The butter in the steamer sampler was great and I dunked my bread in it. The crabs, which should have been amazing, had a mushy texture. Just didn't hold together. I'm not a crab fisherman or chef so I can't tell if they were old or overcooked. Either way, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, casual dress, delicious blue crab, & a great place to go to on a date or with your friends! Vegas needed a place like this! The prices are great too! We've had so much bad service & crab at Red Lobster we've banned it from our restaurant list. Ironically, there's one across the way from here. I won't be surprised if Red Lobster closes soon!"}
{"text":"I thought that the service was really good.  The food was on the mark for a crab house. The blue crabs have a great flavor. The meat is  sweet, though it is a little harder to shell than snow or king crab. We had Sweet potato fries, Cole slaw, corn on the cob, a pound of shrimp and a pound of garlic  blue crab.  The blues shell out a little on the thin side when it comes to the amount of actual crab meat you get, they were good but the majority of the meat for our meal came from the peel and eat shrimp. The Cole. Slaw was ok. Not great. The rest was pretty darn good!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday $2 crabs special! 

I came here with my brother and his girlfriend to try this place out. I was told Tuesday/Thursday  are great days cause of the dine in special of $2 crabs! 

I got five crabs, mini crab cakes appetizers with french fries because my brother ate already so we weren't getting much. The crab cakes were amazing something I never tasted before because i'm used to that frozen store made ones with horrible fillings so this blew me out of the water! The crabs themselves were fresh and hot straight from the steamers, they tasted delicious with that crab seasoning! 

The french fries were delicious, just plain french fries crisp but not too crisp or soggy. I added the crab seasoning they offer on the table on them and it just made the fries from 3/5 to a 5/5 but the seasoning might not be for others. 

The prices are pretty reasonable but that's the price you pay for fresh and good seafood. If you're thinking of trying this place out i'd recommend giving it a try and if it is busy please be patience because this place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service, good happy hour and fun bartender, Ashley.  Food is great we always feel welcome.  I would recommend this place to everyone who knows their seafood.  The open garage door is great on warm afternoons ."}
{"text":"Last year I visited Vegas in the summer and the first time we ever tried this place we were blown away by the garlic steamer sampler! Best blue crab of my life and the amount of crab, shrimp and corn you get is insane, we got so much food for two! Tasted so fresh, atmosphere was adorable, service was awesome and I literally cannot wait to go back at the end of the month. I will definitely get the sampler again, but I know the quality of their other dishes have to be as fresh and delicious as that sampler!"}
{"text":"One of the best compliments you can give a restaurant is to say that it reminds you of home -- provided, of course, that you have fond memories of home. Crab Corner is that kind of place. I spent the first thirty-plus years living in both Virginia and Maryland, where it was routine to buy bushels of crabs on the weekends or go boating and crabbing with my father. 

Being the lazy person that I am, I opted for the crab cake platter instead of the steamed blue crabs. The platter ($25.95 for 2 crab cakes) came with two sides. I upgraded to a cup of Maryland crab soup (an additional $1.50). It's served with half of an in-shell crab. The second side dish was an order of hush puppies -- some of the tastiest ones you'll find in town.

The crab cakes were excellent. They had all the marks of a good crab cake -- very little filler and loosely formed with plenty of lump and jumbo lump meat that falls apart with little effort; enough seasoning to enhance the flavor but not too much as to mask the sweetness of the meat. They're the best crab cakes I've had in Vegas, by far.

They do have a kid's menu that consists of chicken tenders ($5.95) or popcorn shrimp ($6.95). Both come with fries and a drink.

The place is owned by two brothers from Maryland who also own and operate Nevada Seafood Wholesalers, which supplies much of this town's seafood for restaurants and markets like Seafood City. And with those imports comes a slice of nostalgia for any east coaster used to eating fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Love this place!!... Stop here for the happy hour to get the best oysters and $3 drinks. My faves are the yummy crab cakes & steamers... Soooo delish! Sat at bar with Sam who is my new favorite bartender :) Mmmmm drinks were the best ! Sam makes the best cucumber specialty drink!! Be back again & again & again!"}
{"text":"Go on Tuesday for 2 dollar blue crabs. 

The quality of crabs are good but of course, it depends on the season and market offerings.  Just wish they used a bit more seasoning when steaming their crabs.

Oysters on the half shell are excellent.  

Beer battered onion rings were also great.  Recommended.

Staff was friendly and attentive.

Location is good.  Dining area and restrooms were all very clean."}
{"text":"$2 Tuesday Specials!!! $2 per female blue crab! This is an awesome deal considering that each crab is jam-packed with ultimate flavors! Try the best seafood indulgence that you can have at a damn good price! 

P.S. Wear something you are not afraid to get dirty, but do not come naked!"}
{"text":"Great food ,The best crab cakes in town. We all ways bring friends there"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience. Service was great and the food awesome Sam was our waiter he was very pleasant and helpful. Thank you Sam"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was yummy. For starters I got the lobster bisque. I am sometimes scared to order it because it can be fishy tasting to me. This was not at all. Creamy and yummy! For lunch I got the shrimp salad on a roll with chips. The shrimp salad was scrumptious. I just wished there was more of it!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while, I finally made it over!  We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!

The decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. 

So as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking 

I luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram/tutorial to help you crack them!  They have a Yelp Check in offer good on regular priced orders and beer and wine.  I will be back! :D"}
{"text":"I went here after watching James Hsu's video about the restaurant (thanks James). 

Really great! Definitely tasted fresh and like I was on the east coast. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service, yummy food, stopped in here for a quick bite, we will be back! Try the crab cakes, a healthier spin on the usual, they broil them instead of fry."}
{"text":"If you love Maryland style crabs then go no further!  This place is a crabby and clammy kind of vibe!  I am originally from South Florida so Stone crabs are my first love.  But once the waiter showed me how to eat crack and eat these crabs I was in heaven hence the missing star.  He should have asked if we knew what we were ordering and eating.  But overall I recommend if you love to get crabby!"}
{"text":"1 star for flavor & 1 for service. First off, the 1st guy who greeted us (who we later found out was the bartender) quoted us $19 for the snow grab special which included 2 sides. Then later a 2nd server came named Richard took our order. They were actually SOLD OUT on majority of their items we wanted. So whatevers, we still thought we should give it a try. Got our food which was such a small portion amount for their price. Not worth it! Even their oysters were very tiny! On top of that, Service was horrible! No one came to check on our table to see how we were doing the entire time we were there. They were 3 other tables there. But they weren't busy at all! The bill came out & realized the snow crab special w/ 2 sides was NOT $19! We complained, and told Richard the other guy who 1st came quoted us $19. Richard himself, who we then found out was the MANAGER said well he quoted you wrong, I'm the manager! I'll go talk to him. Instead of saying I apologize for his mistake, and adjusting the bill. He just left it as that! No apology for the mistake absolutely NOTHING! Not even a thank you, have a good night! Take your money else where and eat at a seafood buffet, or hot & juicy or even boiling crab! Never again!"}
{"text":"This place was super good. I ordered like a load of seasoned crabs and I ordered the smaller size. Well as I was waiting the owner came out and mentioned that they ran out of small ones and as he handed me the bag, said they just gave us the size larger! How cool! Not trying to make us pay more, but keeping the customer happy. Whenever we hit up the big Vegas we dip in here for a deep seafood fix!"}
{"text":"Visit this place for the 1st time.  Once I walked in I notice the \"GRADE\" of the place, sure enough it was an \"A\".  At this point I knew I was safe!  Customer Service was awesome and polite.  The food was great and flavored nicely.  I recommend this place to anyone that visit or the locals of Vegas to try it out."}
{"text":"Food was really good and decent priced for seafood. I would recommend making a reservation, we went on a Saturday night and it was busy. Check groupon! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"just recently visited las vegas and was tired of the typical casino food places, needed to get some \"real air\" found this place yelping and we were both thrilled at the crab selection they have.  The food was delish.  We ordered crab soup, crab cakes and soft shelled crab platter.....everything was excellent.....I will definately be back on my next Vegas trip.....I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But the food just didnt do it for me. I am all about the food and when I went here the crab and seafood just felt very mediocre. Good but not great."}
{"text":"Read the menu online and went to the Flamingo location, but it is closed for good. An update to the website is in order. 

Since I had a gift certificate, I drove to the Rainbow location and had the Shrimp Po' Boy, which was not bad."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my husband's sons bday and also the purchase of our new home. We  were greeted upon arrival and they sat us down quickly. We opted to sit outside since it wasn't as hot. For starters we ordered the crab dip on toasted bread (it came with 6 pieces) and mozzarella sticks (6 pcs). Our entree consist of Steamed Garlic Sample x 2 (crab legs, small blue crab, shrimp, and corn) market price was $64.99 each which feeds about 2-3 people. Also ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta and French fries. 

The taste was alright. I know I can cook it better at home but we all enjoyed eating it. Alfredo entree is typically the same on most restaurant. Crab dip was delicious btw. I could it 3 plates of it and be satisfied. French fries wasn't as fresh, hot, and crispy. 

The 4 stars was base on the quickness of service, friendly staff, good waitress, and the attentiveness. Food, i would rate between 2.5 to 3 stars. Maybe I'll return back. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"We went to CC for a paint nite event.  We ate first. And all 9 of us were satisfied with our food...that's pretty impressive.  The crab dip appetizer was the best and we tried them all. Richard our server did a great job keeping up with us even while we were painting.  Thanks for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"My feelings are truly mixed about this place. Came here because the fianc√© remember it being really good but I like to believe I'm the food expert. 

We ordered the lobster bisque which is really good! But I think a cup would've do us fine. Comes in second place after Mortons! 

Oysters were the worst! Never tasted or seen any oysters like theirs it was small and weird I wished I taken some pictures but we got 1/2 dozen and my fianc√© doesn't like when I complain so I drown my oysters in salt and Tabasco. 

Second came out clams! Yummmmmy in my tummy these clams were so good and buttery with lots of garlic the best dish tonight! And it came with plain bread to dip with. I would just add some of their Maryland seasoning on there and you're good to go!

Last came my fianc√© king crab claws and my blue crabs.

King crab claws were on the fishy side but I'm not sure if that's normal since I never really liked them. My blue crabs on the other hands were so nice and sweet and tasty BUUUUTTTTT like the other yelper mentioned it was so darn mushy! I went through the first one fine but the second one was so damn mushy it was not safe to eat. I told the waiter and he kindly brought out another one for me. The third one was just perfect!!! They should all be like that! 

I would def come back and give them another try when they have crawfish in season."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon while visiting Las Vegas. This place is like a dive bar & restaurant located in a strip mall. We went on a Sunday & the Baltimore Ravens were playing so half of the customers were wearing Ravens jerseys. They served Maryland crab cakes! I felt at home and conversed with some of the locals who also happened to be transports from Maryland. We sat outside where there are tvs and another bar. We had the crab cakes with bottomless mimosas & sangria. Everything was good but minus 1 star for the overload of pulp in the mimosas. No thank you. 
If you go, get the 2 for $50 Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Quick tip: Try to order 1 dozen at a time because although served hot, they will go cold within a few minutes. The order takes only about 5-10 to come out anyways, so I recommend order as your go.

Great quality blue crab, served extremely hot and flavored with spicy cajun seasoning! For the first ten minutes, the inside juices of the crab is hot to the touch, so be careful. Make good use of the mallet+knife and the meal will be less messy and laborious. Sometimes blue crab is a pain to eat, but there's a few techniques that really makes it easier than just bashing at it. The friendly staff will teach you if you need guidance.

I am more of a dungeness crab eater because the meat is more easily accessible and come in bigger chunks. However, the blue crab here is really easy to crack open once you get the hang of it, and there's plenty of crab to go around so portions doesn't become an issue. I ate about 5 and I felt pretty full. 

The venue is pretty small but cozy. The crab will be ready within ten minutes of ordering (I love fast service!).

A few points I wanna make: The venue is tiny, so there might be a waiting time. The tables are so small it's hard to eat. We sat in the corner and I had a hard time stretching my arms and using the tools. 

Also, I don't know if the cajun seasoning is a winner. I liked it in the beginning, but I really think they should serve it plain. It gets a little bland and tastes repetitive after a while. You can always ask for it later if you want it.

Overall, great place and I would categorize it as experiential eating. It feels awkward not using chopsticks or a spoon but the mallet becomes fun to use after a while."}
{"text":"Crab corner was okay. Now, my favorite dishes were the bacon wrapped scallops. They were absolutely fresh. They only come with 4 though. Ordered the crab dip and the crab cakes as well. Those were delicious. I came in expecting to get the jumbo crabs however they ran out and only had regular and medium sized crabs. Both were very small. Also, I had to send two sets of crabs back because the meat was mushy. Overall it's an okay place. Kinda expensive. If they would've had the jumbo crabs in stock then I would've bumped it up a star."}
{"text":"This place is super dirty!   The kitchen, restrooms and dining are all dirty.  We walked out before getting sick

THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.  THIS IS NOT FAKE AND IT HAS BEEN REPORTED. This is the truth and happened today."}
{"text":"Overrated!!!! I have eaten better crab legs in a lot of places for cheaper and much more flavor!!!  The only thing I liked was the sweet potato tots. Otherwise save your money or lower your expectations"}
{"text":"Really nice place for reasonably-priced seafood. This location is in a nice and new strip mall and has a nice patio and common area as well. Really enjoyed the happy hour Slipjack Oysters - for a buck each you can't go wrong. Still confused about the price of my beer decreasing AFTER happy hour though...
Will go back though to try their lobster deal and the soups the couple at our bench table were raving about."}
{"text":"Starving and craving crab, we came here over 4th of July weekend on a recommendation.  Customer service was excellent.  The servers were extremely attentive and quick.  I also liked that they asked us if it was our first time and offered up suggestions.  They brought everything we asked for quickly.  Plus they came back to check on us throughout the meal.  We ordered a dozen female blue crabs and had the lobster special.  I definitely enjoyed the crabs more than the lobster.  The seasoning they had on the table added a perfect salty spice to the crabs.  I love that they have white rice and Filipino vinegar (it's the little things! LOL)  All in all, we left full and happy!  We will definitely be back the next time we get a craving for blue crabs while we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I love me some crab and I decided to give Crab Corner a try one Friday afternoon while I was out running errands. I really liked the patio and indoor/outdoor bar setup. Plenty of TVs and tables or booths to add to the environment. 
The bartender/waiter was friendly and welcoming to myself and the other patrons. 
I ordered snow crab and cole slaw. The cole slaw was spicy-nice! Crab came out steamed and lightly seasoned. Price is what you would expect for quality product. I would say seafood is not an area where I would nag about high prices."}
{"text":"Bottom line on this recent visit: the crabs are great; the service.....not so much. 

We were served by a waiter named Kyle. After he brought us our drinks, he then took our order of 8 blue crabs (Tuesday's special at $2/crab) and an order of black mussels. We waited for about 10 minutes until the crabs arrived, however there was no sign of the black mussels nor did Kyle tell us that the mussels would be coming up shortly. That's fine we thought. We figured the mussels would arrive soon. 15 minutes into our enjoyment of the crabs, we realized that our order of mussels had yet to arrive. Ok, we'll just ask Kyle about the order of mussels when he checks up on us or when he returns to refill our drinks. 

Turns out that would never happen. 

Not once did Kyle check up on us or refill our drinks until well afterward as we were finishing up our meal. One of the other servers (his name was David, I believe, and he appeared to be a senior member of the staff) took it upon himself to refill our drinks and ask us if we needed more crabs. If it weren't for David, we would still be waiting there to have our drinks refilled and our second order of crabs taken. Prior and after David approaching us, we would notice Kyle walk by and glance at our table several times during our meal. Not once did he ask us if the meal was to our liking nor did he refill our drinks. It seems that he didn't notice our drinks (or lack there of) or that he just couldn't be bothered to refill them. We were not about to ask to have our drinks refilled nor ask about our missing order of mussels because we as paying customers feel that we SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. The server should be looking after the customer frequently and making sure that every need is met without having to be flagged down or asked. 
Only at the very end of our meal did Kyle finally approach us and ask us if we needed anything else. By that point I didn't even mention the order of mussels that we never received and just asked for refills of our water. I would only mention the missing order of mussels if they showed up on our bill (it did not, which is another issue entirely). 

We've been here several times before and have usually had good service. 

This was not one of those times."}
{"text":"I used to live in Maryland, so I am no stranger to good crabs, and this place has the best crabs I have ever eaten. My wife and I visit here often, and the servers are always friendly and attentive. They seem to remember us and try to sit us at the same table every time, which is a nice personal touch. The prices are reasonable, the food is usually fresh, there is almost never a wait to get a table, and the atmosphere is generally very relaxed.

I do have some minor complaints. Sometimes they run out of blue crab. Occasionally they overcook the fried food (like the hushpuppies), although the food is still good. The place can get a little noisy if there is a football game on TV. Occasionally they serve us crabs that taste like they have been dead too long.

This is one of the best crab restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wonderful! My filipino family loves crabs and this past the test. Tips- female crabs are better, we felt the male crabs were smaller. The market price for blue crab is priced per crab. We got the garlic blue crab for 11.99/lb which includes 3-4 crabs (small amount) but tasty. Take out was good. Also got the Brussel sprout and grilled cheese for kids and it was okay. I'll be back for sure. Fast service and quick!"}
{"text":"Already won style points for being open for lunch during the week (I'm looking at you, Boiling Crab).

I wish they had some fast-casual place like this in Chicago. Everything is either a fried greasepit or something pretty expensive.  There is some righteous blue crab action happening here.

I tried the soft-shell crab platter and it was tasty. The crabs weren't too greasy despite being fried and breaded.   My parents, being veterans of this joint, knew right away to get a dozen female blue crabs and then do some work on them.  They'll lay the crabs out on your plastic covered table and give you tools to crack and destroy each one.  Each crab is spiced with some spice that is a Maryland specialty (the name escapes me).  It's definitely messy and not very romantic, but as long as your partner is ok with you looking like a fool with crab all over, go ahead and visit.  

FYI - crabs are market price and flown in from Maryland when in season.  You can order males or females.

The hushpuppies were hearty and delicious.  Fries were ok, but definitely go with hushpuppies for your side.  I also tasted the crab cake sandwich which held its own, but the stars are the cute little blue crabs.

Service was friendly and attentive. Lots of Ravens and Terrapins gear on the wall- dude is proud of his Baltimore roots. We bonded over a conversation about Steve Blake, Juan Dixon, and the last Maryland CBB championship."}
{"text":"So good! Went for lunch, very quiet at the time. The seafood is very fresh. Had the crab chowder, reminds you of clam chowder. In fact, I think that the chowder itself has a clam base. There was a sufficient amount of crab also, which was sweet tasting. I also had the crab cake sandwich...excellent! Oh my! They put very little binder in it, it was made up of almost all, and I mean all, crab! So good. I enjoyed lunch so much, ended up going again with the family for dinner. It was louder and busier, very much a pub setting. Had the fried clam dinner. Again, excellent. The clams were huge, much larger than I've ever had. Hubby had the shrimp, and it did not disappoint. It's great to have an authentic Maryland seafood restaurant on the southwest side of town. Worth the trip even if you are across town."}
{"text":"I go here for my wife since she's addicted to their ocean crustaceans. She really seems to enjoy their food and they always take care of her here.  Not a big fan of seafood myself but if my wife is happy, I'm happy."}
{"text":"Came for some margaritas and seafood and what a great experience we had!  The food was fabulous and CC has the best bartender in town: Ashley!!!  When we asked for blue cheese olives for our martinis, even though CC didn't have them, Ashley actually made them from scratch, the best damn stuffed olives we have ever eaten better than any high-end restaurant on the strip!  We are also from the S.F. Bay Area and Miss Ashley rivals anyone in the Bay Area (where we are from) in bartending excellence - anywhere period!  

Ashley was so amazing that between giving outstanding service, she actually changed light bulbs and handled whatever else was need to ensure we and other clients could relax and chill.  Always a great time and upbeat positive energy.  Ashley always makes us feel at home.  We eat and drink way past our bedtime on many occasions.... LOL

We come back weekly for more bottomless drinks, unparalleled customer service, loads of good conversation, and all-around good food and fund.

Cheers,
Ron & Esa"}
{"text":"The best snow crabs in town! It's about 20 minutes from the strip but well worth it! Hands down it was some of the best tasting snow crabs I've had. My lady and I ordered 2 orders of snow crabs, which were served with 2 sides. I got the hush puppies and potato salad and my lady got onion rings and corn on the cob! Everything stood tall on the table! We got a deal on Groupon which included a free bottle
of wine. Win! Win!"}
{"text":"Being wash ashores from Cape Cod we really enjoyed this place. Happy hour from 2 to 6, oysters for a buck! They weren't Wellfleet but we tore through a dozen with no problem. Can't go wrong with PEI mussels but they were overcooked so 4 instead of 5. We watched as they pulled a lobster for each of us out of the tank kicking like broncos in a rodeo. They were live and fresh and sweet and tender. Good thing it's a long drive for us or we'd be there daily."}
{"text":"Found this place the locals frequent.  Was in a scary neighborhood with sketchy clientele.  Food was ok, needed seasonings.  We didn't get the boiled seafood that seemed to be the preference of most but fried shrimp wasn't outstanding by any means."}
{"text":"Note - this review is based on the experiences of the 7 other people with me - we came here for their Tues Female blue crab special for 2 dollars a crab.  My friends have been here at least 10 times and love it.

Unfortunately after eating half of a crab I started getting sick - 20 mins later I was stabbed with an epipen and off to the races to the ER.  But my personal allergies shouldn't be a reason to downgrade the ranks- everyone in my party loved this place- Def check it out.  Now I know I'm really allergic to blue crabs!"}
{"text":"This is the One and Only place in Vegas for authentic Maryland seafood, and they do it right!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our 2nd night eating here.. Ordered the exact same food expecting the same great taste, BuT NO- ( steamer sampler) the crabs were missing their legs, the muscles smelled funky and tasted even funkier!! Service wouldve been ok had the busser not tried to clear the table while we were still there trying to figure the tip amount and sign the receipt. Bad experience. Definitely not planning to return to this place, unfortunate considering our 1st experience was good."}
{"text":"This is the place to enjoy fresh Maryland blue crabs in the middle of the desert.  Apparently, they are flown in fresh daily.  On Tuesdays, they have $2 regular-size crab and $2 domestic beer specials (I think it's Budweiser).  They offer different sizes of crabs, and on other days, the prices per dozen can be expensive - especially if you can eat a lot.  Personally, I can easily knock out a dozen XL or jumbo crabs.  If crabs aren't  your cup of tea, they also offer other items on their menu.

The service is great! Someone always comes by to check on you."}
{"text":"Phenomenal seafood. Better than any spot I've ever been to back home! I'm a bit of a seafood critic so that's a big deal coming from me. A lot of my friends have gotten on me about it, but Crab Corner has my business for sure. Their oysters and blue crab, Wow! What's in them?! I only wish I could have taken more than just some seafood to go, like the restaurant itself! Is that too much to ask?!"}
{"text":"They have their food figured out. The menu doesn't have very many $10 or cheaper entr√©es considering the bar/lunch atmosphere. The slight premium for the seafood menu isn't bad for the quality. The crab cakes are not deep fried and made with good chunk meat. New location. Would eat again."}
{"text":"This place totally rocked. Friendly,  attentive, and informative staff. Great food! Fast service. My friends and I were in in Vegas for the week. We saw a group on and decided to take a chance and we are so glad we did. I had the King Crab Legs and they were oh so good. My friend had the Blue Crabs and was in heaven. Reasonable prices as well. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Got 6 oysters for $1.00 each. They were very fresh & pretty good. Ordered the fried soft shell crab dinner, which were pretty tiny. Received 3 plus 2 sides for $22.00. Asked about the 2 pound lobster for $36.99. Since there was a menu on our table with happy hour, drink & seafood specials. Oh no the price is $54.00. But their sign says $36.00. No thanks. Saw them on Tanked so we decided to eat here. The fish tank was better then our food. We watched a crab eat a mussel. Red Lobster is better in my opinion. Luckily upon checking in my other half was given a 15 percent off coupon. So we got $8.00 off our meal. With so many food choices in Vegas I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Came across this place when I was exiting off the 215 & Rainbow! I thought hmm Crab Corner must be new! I hadn't seen it before and because I'm such a foodie I just had to try it being that I LOVE seafood! I suggested this place to a friend and she was down to try it out with me! When we walked in we were greeted by a nice guy and was told that because it was Wednesday they were running some sort of \"flip a coin night\" which consist of them flipping a quarter at 10PM and they total out your tab for whatever you've ordered up to this point.. Then if you win you get your whole bill take. Care of.. I thought to myself this is interesting.. We ordered the 8 small crab cakes for $19.99 I believe and I selected off the \"Pick Two\" menu choosing the Atlantic Cod and what we're suppose to be catfish nuggets but came out as a fillet.. No big deal I guess.. You also get two sides with that option and I preferred the corn on the cob followed by the sweet potato fries.. If I could rate my whole meal experience on a scale from 1-10 Id give them a 7.. There was nothing spectacular about my meal in fact I felt like I could've got the same quality out of the VanKemp boxed fish out the frozen food isle at the grocery store. My friend said her crab cakes were just okay as well. Being this place is new Id give it another shot and this time get some CRAB, which is what they specialize in.."}
{"text":"I love the smell of fresh seafood! The calamari was amazing, my Arnold Palmer was mixed with just the right amounts of lemonade & ice tea. I had a shipwrecked po ' boy that was delicious. We went pretty early so the dining area was a bit bare. (It was before lunch time) as we left this place was pouring in. I'd definitely be back. Next time I'll try an actual entr√©e.  There was so much I wanted to try but because I was doing to much that day, I wanted to eat a lighter meal."}
{"text":"I don't seem to share the same feelings as all the other customers who have posted on this restaurant. My daughter and I stopped in yesterday for a quick bite to eat before heading back to work. From the minute we walked in the smell was terrible, granted we know seafood places have a tendency to smell a little funky but this place just smelled bad.  The table condiments were filthy. We were looking at what was available to use and when we picked up the large container of seasoning, it was covered with food and smears and old fingerprints from previous patrons. It looked like someone had been eating crab legs with their fingers then moved onto the seasonings over and over again. The bus boy or waiting staff obviously never wipe them down.  In the women's bathroom the wall was covered in dirt and the bathrooms had all the toilet paper spindles empty with extra TP just sitting on top of the back of the toilet. Looked like no one had serviced or emptied the waste disposal unit located in each bathroom as they were overflowing with trash. 

We decided to play it safe and order the chicken fingers or chicken nuggets I think they were called, we paid approx 10 buck a piece. When they came out there were 2 in each basket with fries.  They were the pre bought frozen chicken fingers and were pretty gross.  It doeskin take much for a restaurant to purchase fresh chicken tenderloins and dredge them in some milk cover them with some flour and deep fry them.  This is a pretty simple meal to prepare for most restaurants.  Not to mention the price was way over for 2 nuggets I mean they weren't even extra big just seems a bit steep for 2 bites.  

Needless to say we wont be back and would recommend that they either find a cleaning crew to clean things up or they wont be in business too long.  Also a little fresh food really goes along way."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Ca. and wanted a seafood dinner and we found a fantastic restaurant! The staff was very helpful with their recommendations. The food was amazing, we had the crab cake appetizer and it was delicious!  We ordered peel n eat shrimp and the crawfish and the spices and taste was amazing!"}
{"text":"There were only two parties when we ordered crab sampler but it took 30 minutes to get it. When we picked up a shrimp from the sampler, suddenly our server came and took out the sampler from our table without any explanation. 
Later he came back with different sampler and said it was not ours. And then I saw he brought out the same sampler from kitchen later. 
Overall this restaurant is not recommendable because of the service. It would be much better if he explained us before he just took out the food without saying anything."}
{"text":"I drive by this place just about everyday on my way to work. I've always been curious about it.

While out and about yesterday we decided to stop in and give it a try.

I ordered the shrimp PO Boy sandwich. My girl ordered the BLT.

The BLT was edible. The Shrimp Po Boy was not. 
I'm not a picky eater, but I was only able to take two bites of the Po Boy. It tasted like old grease. The shrimp were tasteless.

The waiter stopped by and asked how the food was. I told him horrible. He just smiled and walked away. I think he must have misheard me  LOL

Other options may be better, but you've only got one shot to make a first impression. The impression they left won't have us coming back."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for you to open. Not the same Maryland crab house feel as the other location but just as good on the food and service rock on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ! I never thought I would fast crabs from back home until stumbling on this place."}
{"text":"Thanks Crab Corner for reconnecting me with the food of my Mid-Atlantic youth while visiting Vegas. Thick and rich Crab Bisque"}
{"text":"We had a great, reasonably priced seafood meal here on a Saturday night. We had great service and the music made a fun atmosphere!  Also, if you are into March Madness there are TV's playing all the games!  If you are looking for a laid back fun place for a quality seafood dinner, then give the Crab Corner a try!  The Annapolis Crab Dip was delicious and I could eat it everyday!"}
{"text":"I'm from Maryland. Meaning I know Maryland blue crabs like the back of my hand. This place exceeds all expectations. Not only was the food over the top, the service was phenomenal. We ordered the large and medium crabs, and they did not disappoint! We also ordered the mini crab cakes, which were the best I've had so far on the west coast. The cream of crab soup, and the Maryland crab soup were also on point! Being from the east coast, we have a deep love for shaved ice, and flavored egg custard. We were so surprised that they had shaved ice here, most surprised by the egg custard. Sooooo good! I could rant over this restaurant all night! Go! They have good deals, Tuesday's regular crabs and Budweiser are $2 a piece! You can check groupon for deals too, $17 for a $25 voucher! Absolutely love the two guys working, and the fact that the owners are from Bowie. Much love from Frederick Maryland y'all! 

Crab cakes and football. That's what Maryland does!"}
{"text":"We found a taste of Maryland in the desert! The minute we walked in we felt like we were back home . Being from Baltimore I could appreciate the authentic feel of walking into a restaurant back on the east coast.  Our waiter Ivan was very welcoming, very friendly and gave us outstanding service. The crabcakes were outstanding, served Maryland style with lots of lump meat and no filler. We also had the Annapolis crab dip,  very delicious!  To top things off, they also had Tastycakes!!  We will definitely be back every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the best crab house in town. Very authentic and good prices plus the owners are very friendly. I love going here anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"AJ is awesome. Always so helpful, knowledgeable, and knows the menu like the back of his hand. Tell him your tastes and he'll give perfect recommendations! 

Update on the hush puppies: order em', eat em', love em'."}
{"text":"It is incumbent upon Rex to apologize for his long absence...let's say that Rex was training for the Olympics and now that is over he can get back to writing reviews...his true passion. (That is a much nicer story than coming to the realization too late that apparently old folks homes don't want to see Rex's erotic version of Winnie the Poo...especially the poo part...and that it took 4 arrests and 5 stints in county before he realized this absolute truth...yes...olympics is nicer.) 

In between...um...workouts for the Olympics...Rex aways would crave seafood. Let's just say where Rex was...um...working out...they didn't have access to the freshest seafood...damn jail...Rex means London...whatever.

The powerful pull of amazing seafood is one that Rex is often subject to...but in Las Vegas Nevada there is a very low...VERY LOW chance of being able to find that great seafood. Even at the classiest restaurants their dumpsters are filled with leftover subpar seafood. Also, in these recessionary times Rex...like all of us...is ever conscious about finances...when he makes his own roofies...he uses immitation Mentos...that is how broke Rexy is right now...but that is another story.  So, where does a budget conscious foodie who is desperate to get that sweet meat from the sea...(ironically Sea Sweet Meat was Rex's nickname in the Navy)...well...Rex has found the best possible place. A place that isn't just good for Vegas...which many places could be labeled...no...this is GREAT for anywhere. Where is it...Crab Corner. Even the words are great...Crab (not crabS...that isn't good)...and Corner...which we can all agree is better than a square. 

First and foremost before we get to the menu...which is all brilliant...one thing must be said...ALL OF THE SEAFOOD IS FLOWN IN FRESH EVERY DAY!!!!! Really read that and understand what it means. FRESH EVERY DAY!!  Not this frozen crap that is sold in stores...that isn't seafood...that is a waste of money. Since Rex has spent his time in the east coast...he knows great seafood...and you CANNOT FREEZE SEAFOOD AND THINK IT IS GOOD!! The fact that these two brothers (great guys, they don't even mind when Rex licks their dumpster) would go to this extent to provide great ingredients is a testament to their commitment. At this point it would be almost impossible to screw up and they dont.

Let's start with the greatest dish they have and the FINEST bowl of soup in town...the lobster bisque. Proof in one bowl there is a God. There are no fillers, it isn't some cream filled monstrosity with some frozen crab thrown in it. NO!  This is the real deal. The depth of flavor they get is just out of this world. No life can be complete and NOT eat a bowl of this soup. Rex wants his ashes to be thrown in the soup and then served to unsuspecting customers...that is how good the soup is and how bad Rex is.

The rest...is all great. The crabs are obviously amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. The jewel of Rex's heart is the FRESH, hand battered oysters. Salty, briney, sweet, perfectly battered. Just amazing. Rex could go on and on but there is nothing bad.  If there is one minor complaint, to nitpick, their cole slaw is uninspired, the sweet potato fries are sometimes too soggy and one of Rex's lobster tail was extremely overcooked to the point of rubbery. Sometimes the attention to detail in the more delicate culinary pursuits are just not done as well as they should be. Still, on the whole this is the BEST seafood restaurant in town and it won't break your bank.

As the great Rex Marvin says...\"does it smell like fish....then give her to Rex!\"  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and I had the crab legs and they were very good. They were hot and full of meat and the seasoning was spot on. I also got the corn and french fries on the side they were good and hot. My friend got the shrimp with the potato salad and hushpuppies. She said everything was good and she would be back. She was glad I had recommended this place since it was her first time. I will definitely continue to go to the Crab Corner."}
{"text":"Delicious. Super friendly. AJ walked us through first time, made great recommendations. Ordered crab cake appetizers - smaller than expected but top notch, fresh, delicious. Cod and shrimp terrific - sweet potato fries with too thick for me but hubby loved them. And the soft shell crab sandwich to die for! Used a groupon. Great deal :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food. Overpriced. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"I come to crab corner on a regular basis. The soft she'll crab and crab cakes eggs Benedict is amazing. The service form Ashley the bar tender is superb my drink is always filled and she is always attentive to her guests. The service here is one of the main reasons I keep coming get back"}
{"text":"Not impressed....staff friendly but in regard to the food it was poor. Two people in my party had hamburgers which were decent sized and tasted good but fries were cold. Two seafood platters were ordered and the portions were ridiculously small for the price. My $17.00 dollar plate consisted of one crab cake that was smaller than the palm of my hand and a scoop of potato salad which was decent along with corn on the cob. The taste was so so. The fourth person in party ordered another seafood platter which was tasteless and hush puppies that tasted stale. Again friendly staff but the $90 bill tasted more like $30. Won't visit again simply for the fact that the portions are way too small for the price and the taste is average at best."}
{"text":"We found the place through groupon.  We did not use the coupon as they did not honor it after purchase.  We stayed anyways as we had kids with us.  Expect that you will be treated lowly when you present the coupon from Groupon.   There is a reason they are in the 80% for recommended on Groupon.  The food was good, but would say for the price...nothing to brag about.   As for the service... Read the reviews of others... It's a hit/miss.  Definitely don't mention a Groupon if you want good service.  They are prejudice to this whether you use it or not."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant last night at 530 pm with my family and they had no crab. If you are a crab restaurant shouldn't you have crab?  The waiter didn't seem to care about us too much as he spent his time on his cell phone most of the evening.

The restroom at this location is also filthy. Their location off of Rainbow is much nicer. Yet, after my bad experiences at both locations now I'm in no hurry to go back again."}
{"text":"It's been 10 days since my visit and I was going to let my bad experience go but yesterday I visited another crab corner location and it was just as bad and I couldn't let it go.

Our visit to this location was during their Tuesday special and we arrived at 5:45pm and was able to catch the tail end of their happy hour. I've come in the past with my family and we enjoyed the crab. I wanted to order about a dozen female crabs but our waiter suggested I order half now and the rest later so it wouldn't get cold. An hour later we are approached by the owner apologizing for the delay but the expediter was new and gave our crab to another table. He gave us shrimp to nibble on and another beer as we waited for our crabs. Our waiter at this time was also the bartender and he was very VERY apologetic and sincere. Over an hour later we get six crabs. I don't trust the wait so I order six more female crabs. He appologizes that they are out of the smaller size but we will get the larger size for the same price. When the crabs arrive they are all males. I ask what happened to my order of females and he again apologizes that they ran out. Well I still don't understand why they didn't say they ran out of female crabs when I ordered. 

Lesson learned from my visit to both locations ...just because they are named crab corner and boast their Maryland crabs doesn't mean they have crabs to sell at their restaurants, maybe the crabs are hiding in the ocean but next time I want blue crabs I'll head over to the Asian market and cook them myself."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed tonight. We called before leaving to ask about the crabs. We we told they had small crabs for $2 each had plenty . We were there in 10 minutes to be told they were out they sold 3 dozen to a customer. For a Maryland crab house to think that 3 dozen crabs is a lot. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a seafood eater, but I enjoyed the food and the great service here. It's a must the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't get it... Maybe I was in on an off day.

My beau and I walked in around 12:30pm and there was no wait staff to be found. Stood around a bit until one walked out from the back of the house and we were told, rather apathetically, to sit wherever.

There were two other couples in the restaurant. One was in the process of sending the blue crab back because it had a weird texture and the other had to get up and ask for food that had been sitting and waiting to be delivered to the table for like 5 minutes.

We should have run... But we didn't.

We ordered snow crab (didn't want to chance getting funky blue crab), head-on shrimp, and crawfish.

The snow crab sucked. It was really dry. I sent it back.  The shrimp were hard to peel but that could have been due to a number of reasons. The crawfish were really good, though!

The wait staff was very nonchalant and apathetic about serving. One dude ran around with a fly zapper that looked like a tennis racquet and zapped the things while we were eating... Made a zapping sound every time he got one. Bugs are gross in a restaurant... I'm not sure zapping them while we're eating is any better though.

They get one star because the crawfish were delicious and one more star for having a really bomb Cajun sauce."}
{"text":"I mean, nothing special... No taste of anything was over the top. Service is super casual, I'll stick with boiling crab!"}
{"text":"For a true Maryland style seafood restaurant you can't beat Crab Corner. The Annapolis crab dip is amazing. The steamed shrimp and crabs, delicious. Lobster bisque, excellent.. Not to mention the friendly staff that provides great service. If you are from Maryland, like I am, it even smells like home. Not to mention the $2 crabs & beer on Tuesdays and they have Tasty Kake products too! Now if they only carried Rapa scrapple my wish list for this restaurant would be complete!"}
{"text":"Such a joy to watch my husband savor the food from his hometown, you guessed it, Baltimore. But, we met in Vegas 10 years ago, and I am no blue crab afficionado. After reading instructions on the wall about a 437 step process that requires removing a devil, I thought, \"Hell, I'm no exorsist\", so I ordered lobster. While my husband drowled at the crabs, I screamed like a little girl, \"Take it away, take it away!\" I know, I'm dumb, but the guy, the lobster, probably known as \"Legs\" to his friends, was looking right at me. To my astonishment, the waiter... I should have remembered his name, and the name of the gracious cook... pulled his buddy away from my screams, and explained to Legs that he was going to have to be de-shelled by another before fulfilling his life's mission of giving pleasure. The cook was so kind as to remove every bit of meat and then serve it to me. That was amazing. Of course, I tipped him... Don't forget that when you are in Vegas, please. Sorry, I digress. Crab Corner is a great place and we're taking his brother tomorrow. BTW, we're pigs, but for 3 people, because we brought my Dad a doggie back... I think we ordered a dozen crab, large, 2 lobster dinners... the bill was about $100, $134 after tip. Tiny bit steep, but worth it. I just think if we're paying $134, there is really no need for a 60 MINUTE PARKING sign out front."}
{"text":"Myself, my girlfriend and my family all went there today from the reviews of the Yelpers.

Great food and fantastic service. If you are looking for a casual place with good food, try this place.

If Lobster is your thing, their market price is fantastic. 3 pounds of Maine lobster for $37, not bad. The other dishes are less in price, but still great food.

Give them a try."}
{"text":"Too bad about CC. It used to be soooo much better. We just left there as I review still hungry and frustrated as hell. We arrived at 4:00 and sat at the bar to play a little video poker. No bartender in sight but alas a waitress shows up to pour us a semi cold one. Once our twenties were gone we sat at a table behind to order some food. A dozen oysters and a dozen crabs please. The oysters came but the crabs never did. 2 tables over was the owner and a client perhaps. As we waited and waited I asked the bartender who had showed up about the crabs. He said they were coming. At 5:30 I got up and told the owner about our dilemma which perhaps he should've noticed. I told him we were leaving to get something to eat somewhere. He never got up. Wow!"}
{"text":"We come to this crab corner every time we come to Las Vegas. This time twice. We love their muscles the broth is to die for, get extra bread you will need it for the broth. Everything we get is great. Catfish, lobster grill cheese was awesome. Peel eat shrimp is amazing also. Servers and bartenders are all great."}
{"text":"We are from Maryland, but have not lived there for 7 years, and my wife is a crab lover. The steamed crabs, the crab cakes, crab soup, old bay wings and board walk fries were all excellent. Made us feel like we were back on the Chesapeake."}
{"text":"Service here rocks! The Crabs are DELICIOUS!!!! I'm here every Tues or Thursday for their $2 females on Tues and $3 Medium Males on Thursday! If you like Blue Crabs then this is the place for you. Notice my excitement typing this review."}
{"text":"I've loved coming to this place ever since they opened up their location on Eastern. The food is excellent!  the crab cakes are delicious, the crabs are mouth watering and you can't go wrong with the seasoned fries. Anyone complaining about how long it takes for the food to come out is full of it. It takes time to steam crabs, it takes time to prep it, it takes time for freshly made food to be delivered to your table. If you come in here thinking it's a fast food joint, you're wrong and need to go somewhere else like McDonalds. If you have any issues, ask for my man David. He'll immediately fix it for you."}
{"text":"Stepping inside of the Crab Corner immediately made me reminisce of the former failed Italian eatery once in its place. The memories were easily found with the same set-up, even with alignment remaining the same. This should have been more than a hint, but of course we proceeded to order.

The menu was basic, but much listed as 'market' price. With the bill, the market rates seemed to be more from a greedy Wall Street banker lining their pockets on seafood futures, than from a local crab shack worth spending a dime.

The food was not bad, but very in-proportionate and served on China from a local dollar store. The table was crowded with customary sauces and shakes of seasonings, but oddly served in a Pepsi bucket as if a local sports bar.

The service was poor at best. Perhaps suited for a group of college kids out for a binge, but not to par with expectations for such high prices and very subpar presentation. 

In closing I would not make this a personal recommendation, but then again know that for the same price there are wide selections of superior rated and highly frequented competitors not far off the beaten path."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food, wait staff and even the music. Jade was our server and he was great. Our daughter has T1D and he helped with what was good for her on the menu. Definitely going back again!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this \"fine\" dining restaurant. The service was terrible. They advertise as \"wino Wednesday\" half off bottles of wine but the menu has been printed with sold out on all of the wines. I will say the king crab was amazing and I also liked the oysters. The shrimp was overlooked and the shell was impossible to take off. The lobster was very chewy. The waiter didn't pay much attention to detail. He brought us the crab legs with nothing to break them with and no bucket to put the shells. We had to ask multiple times for our drinks, silverware and items we purchased. We may go back and give it one more try as it may have been an off night!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good food and customer service and a fun atmosphere when the Ravens play during football season. The blue crabs are excellent and I also recommend the garlic cooked half crab and the boardwalk fries."}
{"text":"**** WARNING -- BUGS ****** WORST experience ever!!! A huge COCKROACH crawled across my table. Not a small baby, a huge roach about an inch and a half long and half inch wide crawled across my table in the later half of my meal. I immediately got up, in disgust and walked away from my table. Several waiters/waitresses stood by, offering no assistance ... When I spoke to a manager (moments later) he told me I was to pay for my meal in full or he would call the cops!!! I was SO outraged. As I offered to tip my waiter accordingly, but did not feel it was right for me to pay for this meal, he called the cops on me and I stayed in the restaurant till they arrived. The cops told me if I didn't pay I would get a ticket for stealing. So I payed for the meal, and left in a complete outrage - not to mention totally disgusted. I have never experienced such unprofessional or worse treatment from an owner of a restaurant (apparently that's who I spoke to when I asked for a manager, he claimed to be the half owner)  I Will do everything in my power, to detour business from this establishment. Absolute worst restaurant experience of my life.  I only put one star because I have to, to post this review. 

Before the roach appeared, I was not too impressed with the meal anyways. I had the crab cakes. Very dry and bland. I recommend The Boiling Crab or Hot & Juicy for anyone who seeks a proper seafood experience."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Bears game on a Sunday. We were the very first table in the restaurant at 1030 am for brunch. We had a Groupon that included bottomless brunch drinks and $15 food credit. The Bloody Mary was extremely too salty. Pretty much undrinkable. I ordered a beer to add to the bloody but the server never offered to remake it.  We ordered some blue crabs which were okay but seemed slightly under cooked. We switched over to the Sangria which was pretty good but tasted like it was Franzia or maybe from a box. What really got to me was just when the Bears go into overtime the server or maybe owner switched EVERY TV in the place to the Ravens game. We had been there for two hours watching the whole game and he REFUSED to leave one tv on for me to catch the end of the Bears game. He could tell I was extremely upset and just said sorry there is nothing I can do, this is a Ravens bar. That was extremely disappointing to me. Bad customer service in my opinion. The service wasn't bad but this was a deal breaker for me. We still left a 25% tip but I'm not sure if I'll be back which makes me sad because I really liked this place. :("}
{"text":"I'm never coming back here again. Extremely strange and uncomfortable customer service here. If anything, I recommend NOT eating here and just ordering carryout."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for the weekend from San Diego and saw this place after looking through Groupon ($19 for $25 worth of food). Originally from Maryland, so I know my blue crabs/crab cakes... This place is as good as it gets for a taste of the Chesapeake Bay! I'm so glad we stopped in for lunch before our flight back and even ordered an extra crab cake sandwich to take with me since I can't get blue crab cakes (yes it matters what kind of crab it is) in SoCal. AJ greeted us immediately upon entry. He was super friendly and knew we were in a hurry so helped us out with suggestions, even though I knew what I was getting. My gf and I split a crab pretzel... SO GOOD! I almost didn't have room for my crab cake after.. but I managed to power through. Even the fresh made potato chips seasoned with crab spice were on point. I would have loved to had time to pick a few steamed blue crabs, but just wasn't able to. Prices were a little steep but where else can you get fresh East Coast seafood? It was worth every penny. The decor was totally Maryland which I loved. I knocked a star off because they support the Ravens (Boooo.. GO REDSKINS!) and because they had a South Carolina seasoning on the tables instead of Old Bay (bad form Crab Corner). But AJ did provide me with a can of the OB upon request, so not a total bust. This will definitely be getting a return visit whenever I'm back in Vegas. Nice little taste of home before Xmas to remind me of my family. Thanks AJ and Crab Corner!! Go Terps! HTTR! Go O's! C-A-P-S!"}
{"text":"I visited Crab Corner for a quick lunch. I have been craving a good Lobster Roll and heard from a close friend that this place does an excellent job. 

This was not your normal, oversized roll with a mediocre amount of Meat. I was blown away at the amount of lobster they stuffed into the buttery, soft bread. The lobster mixture had a great flavor and the side of fries made for a perfect combination! 

I will definitely be visiting Crab Corner again!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate there for the first time this week. The atmosphere is casual with picnic tables and brown wrap paper as the table covering. We had a variety of item and we enjoyed them. 

The oyster sandwich was different and tasty. And best of all, the food is served quickly and HOT! 

We enjoyed the availability of cold beer and wine with our meals.

We were greeted promptly and our server, AJ, was very  informative! In fact, he was a model employee. They appeared to be short handed and AJ was doing it all. Meeting and sitting customers, setting the table, getting the food and drinks, cleaning up the tables! I mean he was all over the place and still remained friendly and accommodating! 

A nice place for casual dining. We will definitely return! Check out their deal on Groupon! That is what brought us in!"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the customer service and time of delivery for our food was great. However, the food was not so great. I ordered the Lobster Bisque, it was overly buttery. Crab cakes tasted like buffalo wings. My husband ordered the Dungess Crab, he said it was not good. My children had grilled cheese and thankfully you can't screw that up. Spent $80 for this dinner and it wasn't even worth half of that. Never going back."}
{"text":"Best snow crab I've ever had! Very large and tasty! Bartender also gave me the \"extra\" stuff from my margarita blend."}
{"text":"The first time I came here wasn't sure what to expect as I don't usually go to a crab place, as I'm not much of a shelled fish eater, but I brought a friend who was. 

David is a character and one of the coolest guys out there! (don't let his looks intimidate you, he's super cool) I believe he is the manager, and I was able to meet the owner, Mark, who was also very friendly! All the staff seemed very friendly. OH if you're a Raven fan, it's your place to hang out! 

We had some appetizers to start off, mini crab cakes with tartar sauce and lemons, I loved them, they were moist and pretty big for a 1oz size (or I'm really bad at judging size based on weight), and they were all cooked to a golden brown. I'm not a big crab person, but I really did enjoy them though. The next appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip, which contained cream cheese and crab meat served on a toasted baguette. This was also delicious! It was hot when it came to our table so we waited a bit before chomping down on this and loved every bite, there were six that came out with the order. Oh the crab dip was a bit greasy too, if you're not into that, then be careful about ordering. 

So because I'm not a big shelled fish person I ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries. Which came out in a basket with a paper, no surprise there, I wasn't expecting anything fancy. I had fries and a corn on the cob as my sides. So I tried the cod and it reminded me of Crown & Anchors fish&chips which I have to say is the BEST in town, so Crab corner can compete with them on that! The fries on the other hand had their special \"Maryland\" seasoning, which I fell in love with! The corn also had the seasoning too, though on the corn it was a bit stronger than the fries, but it was still all delicious to me! 

My friend on the other hand got this large pan, I believe it's one of their specials not sure what it's called though, but it looked like it had 3 crabs, several large shrimp, mussels and clams, and on top of that had 4 pieces of half cut corn on the cob, all topped with their Maryland seasoning. I tried a piece of the shrimp and it was cooked with perfect seasoning and I really enjoyed it, it was very fresh, I could still taste the ocean in it as I don't with prepackaged stuff you'd find in your frozen seafood section at the grocery. I believe my friend enjoyed all the clams, mussel, shrimp, and crabs. 

All the seafood is fresh and they have a Tuesday $2 special on the blue crabs and if you're a Raven fan, they have specials during the game such as every touchdown the Raven's get you get a crab on the house, and if you come in with Raven colors you get a discount on the bill and such. 

It's overall a good place to go to and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family who love seafood especially shelled fish!"}
{"text":"Decided to come to this location finally! Some of the usual faces that I normally see at the original location like David, Richard, and AJ. There always pleasent people to see! Don't worry they flip back and forth between both locations so you'll see them somewhere! =]

The location is pretty nice, just northwest of the I-215 on Rainbow, pretty convenient to get to and it's a lot larger than the original location that's on Flamingo and Eastern. They have booths, half booths, tables, outdoor stuff, and a bar!! 

$2 Tuesdays plus happy hour? That's always a plus walking in during happy hour! You know I'm happy ;) I always enjoy getting a couple of crabs usually around four crabs plus a side, which leaves enough room to go down the street for some dessert! 

For a $2 Tuesday and happy hour, it wasn't busy at all! Maybe I'll be frequenting this location a little more and see, but there's usually a wait if you get to the Flamingo/Eastern location around dinner time, but this one had zero wait time! :D"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was extremely slow. We sat at a table in front of the kitchen and watched our food sit in the window.  We had to stop someone for drink refills because the original server only came by once. 
-I appreciate the quick response from management, but there may have been 5 tables total in the restaurant and they already had their food."}
{"text":"This Vegas weather is too good to miss out on. So instead of staying home for dinner, I asked my husband if we could go out. He said sure, but where?  So after a little bit of scrolling through my Yelp Bookmarks, we settled for Venezuelan. So driving down Rainbow from Warm Springs, I opened my big mouth and said, \"oh, Crab Corner is right there!\"  To which my husband said, \"oh, I could use a crab pot!\" and makes a U-turn.

We got there right before the \"dinner rush\". We sat down ordered water and a Pepsi and started looking over the menu when my husband realized, it wasn't the Creole crab pot style restaurant. Hence the Maryland Crab signs all over the restaurant. Although a little bummed, we were already seated and so we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did.

#1, thing we loved about this place, the 80s music. It really brought us back in time.
#2, the lobster bisque was amazing
#3, the soft shell crab was pretty good
#4, super large portion of pasta under the large grilled salmon. So much so, that I don't think I ate half of it.

The service was great, but a little slow.

As we watched dishes come out from the kitchen, because we were seated right outside of it, my husband noticed that some platters coming out only had rows of crabs.  As we got our check, my husband asked the waitress what that was about since he didn't see it on the menu. The waitress pointed out to the chalkboard behind me where it had a list of crab sizes and prices for female versus male crabs. She explained to us that those tables had only ordered the crabs. The least expensive was $4 for the small female crab while the most expensive was the jumbo size male at $12. Per the waitress, the jumbo male size measures 7-inches. The price for crab of the size crab is reasonably priced.

Note: If you're accustomed to having just crab legs, the measurement is referring to the body of the crab and not the legs. I've had dinner with girlfriends where they've never had shellfish in its natural shell and was surprised when it came out.

Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible! I had the cod basket which was pretty standard but I really don't like fish. I don't know if they make their own sauces but their cocktail sauce was soooo good. Seriously though, EVERY time someone walked by my table they would ask how we were and it wasn't even their table! Really really enjoyed the environment :-)"}
{"text":"This place has the best crab cakes I've had in such a long time. The cakes were actually made of crab, and it wasn't a bunch of filler. It had large pieces of jumbo lump crab meat, and it had no fishy taste whatsoever. The crab was sweet and succulent. The remoulade sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the sandwich. The service was friendly and prompt. The facility was clean, and the bathrooms looked and smelled good. The toilet actually had a shell in place of the usual flusher, which I thought was pretty cute. The only thing I can bitch about is the fact that this place is in Vegas, and I live in Minneapolis. I will definitely be back the next time in Vegas, and I can't wait to try out some of the other seafood, as well. Why the hell can't we have a place like this in Minneapolis? We can't even get fresh jumbo lump crab meat here; I can only find it in canned form, which isn't worth the trouble or the money. 

Thanks Crab Corner! Keep it up."}
{"text":"We have been to the Crab Corner on two occasions.
They have fantastic Maryland Crab Cakes, mussels, Steamed Blue
Crab, and wonderful clams.  The food is outstanding.
It is not a fancy restaurant , with paper towels, plastic forks, knives, etc.
They do have take out for convenience.  There was no problem with
parking and the prices were moderate. 
Most enjoyable.
Hannah J."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great prices for seafood.  Jeremy and Chrissy were very friendly and accommodating.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The ambience is like a cheap Mexican restaurant,  but the prices are equivalent to a nice seafood place. The service was poor, food came out at irregular intervals, and my brothers' salmon came out well after I was half way done. My \"bread\" was a toasted hamburger bun, slightly burned. The food isn't bad, but Red Lobster across the street has a better ambience, seating and cheddar-bay biscuits, and better food with no real difference in price. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great for Charm City fans! The wings were great..add some Old Bay! There was a dude across the way enjoying some crabs. Service was kinda slow, if you're a drinker I suggest getting a pitcher unless seated at the bar. Full of life and a friendly atmosphere with multiple flat screens to enjoy the game!"}
{"text":"No one in their right mind would pass up the Seafood offered by the Crab Corner. We lived in Vegas for 10 years and had Blue Crabs at least 3 Thursdays every month. Tonight, we are visiting Vegas and had to have the most fabulous crabs on Earth. Yep, we're back at the Corner with our old friends having crabs. They are an imported treat not to be duplicated in a thousand miles."}
{"text":"Was feeling like seafood tonight so me and my girlfriend decided to try this seafood joint.  It close to where we live which is a plus.  It's literally on the corner.  Upon entering the restaurant it has a divey feel to it.  It's pretty small as well.  We let the guy know it was our first time there and the next thing they tell us is that they are out of Blue Crab.  I checked in to yelp after that and there was a special check in for Blue Crab. 

So I had crab cakes and calamari for appetizers.  They had oysters as the daily special for 1 dollar each.  I finished the meal off with king crab legs that were delicious.  The tab was around 80 bucks.  Normally when we spend that kind of money we are at a fancy restaurant.  Service was ok for a small restaurant.  Would I try it again....maybe....but when I or my lady spend that kind of money it's normally at a all you can eat seafood buffet."}
{"text":"Bad or slow service, you decide when you eat here. 
Had to beg to get butter for my $27 fresh crab. Food is better than average, services aren't."}
{"text":"I'm so tempted to give 4 stars. However, I must take away 1 star and here's why. (2 parts)
We ordered the lobster bisque and the 1 1/4 lbs steamed crab legs.
1.  They brought the bisque out and literally ONE minute later, brought out the crab legs!
HELLO! I haven't even had 2 bites of my bisque!!!
Either my bisque will get cold (EEEWWW), and it wasn't served piping hot to begin with, or my crab legs will! I ordered the bisque TO START! That's usually how it works, lol.
2.  The crab legs definitely didn't seem like 1.25 lbs. I buy crab legs constantly and know what a lb is. This was about .75, definitely not 1.25 and for $19.99, they should give you exactly what they advertise.
The bisque TASTED delicious, although there was NO lobster. Not one chunk of lobster at all. Bummer, as I asked the waiter specifically if there were chunks in there. The crab was good, but certainly started getting cold by the time I was done with my bisque. So, I wasn't LOVING either as I felt so rushed to eat both.
Prices are decent, and service was OK. I think I'll wait til the one near my house opens, and maybe it will be better there!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of not leaving good reviews but unfortunately I'm not a fan of this place. Everything was extremely salty and didn't seem fresh. I didn't enjoy the service or the ambiance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!  The crab is well cooked and on Tues/Thursdays they have $2 female and $3 Male crabs.  The owners are very nice and the service is great.  Dipping the crab in a spicy vinegar with old bay makes the taste amazing.  Everyone has their own way of eating Blue crab, but I crack it open, and put all the insides on a side of rice and go at it with a hammer.  I highly recommend if you like crab."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT the food over the top !!! Must go and enjoy the food and Richard and Ivan are waiters was the best !!! We will be coming back every time !! The calamari and breakfast omelettes not to mention the Bloody Mary So over the top !! 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Not great.  To many places like this in Vegas and quality is lost in quantity. Service is so so.  Used a Groupon.  Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been at Crab Corner several times with my family.  We come here to enjoy TRUE Maryland Crabcakes as they are the only restaurant in town that has them.  I resided in MD for many years so have a discerning palette for Crabcakes and Crab Soup.  Crab Corner does a superlative job of bringing Maryland Food to Las Vegas.  Today I came in without my family so I sat at the bar with the bartender named Sam.  He was informative, professional and polite.  Their crabby hour has several tasty items that are delectable for an affordable price.  Please check them out, you will be happy.
My family and I will be back for many years."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Service was so so and so was the food. For appetizer I had buffalo wings with bleu cheese dressing which was good and for my entree I had Salmon w/ angel hair pasta. It was bland. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"5 of us decided to visit Crab Corner and the following items are what we ordered:

Dozen of female blue crab-we chose this because there were eggs in the crab.  True, it felt like we had to do a lot of work for a little crab meat, but the crab meat is quite sweet.  The price, $35/dozen.  

5lbs of Crawfish-Too heavy on the oil and butter.  One of us, who loves crawfish and can eat 5 lbs by himself easily, ate 3lbs and had to stop because it was too heavy for him.

Boardwalk fries-It sounded good when the server described it to us...but it tasted like any other fries that we have eaten.  Not so impressive.

The cool thing is that when you check in, you get a free soda!  That was unexpected.  

Also right now, you buy 12 dozen of crab, you get the 13th dozen free."}
{"text":"We had the Garlic steamer sampler. An easy choice that comes with a variety of seafood, crab included. The Clam Chowder and Lobster bisque is superb. We asked for additional corn cobs and a bowl of Maryland Crab soup to top off a wonderful meal. A bit pricey for dinner but acceptable. 

The service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"First timer here during our visit to Vegas. This is a nice and casual restaurant outside of the strip about 20 mins drive. The food and service are both great. We ordered calamari as appetizer and they were crunchy and tasty with their sauce. Main entrees were lobsters and crab cakes. Seafood here is very fresh and crab cakes were solid chunks of crab all excellent. We ordered sides of boardwalk fries, green beans, corn and potato salad. My fav was the potato salad it was very homemade. I would definitely recommend this place and will return when in the Vegas area. Thanks Richard for great service."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating blue crabs, and I absolutely loved it. The restaurant wasn't anything formal by any means and has the appearance of sort of a sports bar. We were promptly seated and were informed of the Tuesday $2 blue crab special. The service from then on out was a little slow and scattered, but it was completely understandable - one waiter was running the entire restaurant (~10 tables). What I did like, is for those that didn't know how to eat blue crabs, the waiter would stop by and explain the different parts of the crab and how to get to the good stuff.

Crab soup: Disappointed. All the of crab meat was shredded and the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the broth. The soup wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't anything special. 

Beer battered cod: The fish was still tender and the batter wasn't anything overwhelming. Great.

Fried Oysters: Delicious! The breading was a little heavier than I would've liked, but the oyster was incredible fresh and juicy on the inside.

Hush Puppies: Absolutely amazing. These were seriously the best hush puppies I've had.

Crab cakes: Loaded with meet. I could barely find any filler at all. They had incredibly delicious flavor. Because they're loaded with meat, the price is somewhat steep: $16 for 1 cake/$25 for 2. However, getting 1/3lb of crab meat per cake makes it worth it.

Blue crabs: Wonderful flavor. I actually like the flavor of blue crab more so than king/snow/dungeness, but the work:meat ratio is MUCH higher with blue crab. Expect to work a lot harder for your food with these crabs. It's totally worth it, but if you don't have the patience, just order the crab cakes and you'll be set.

Mussels: Great garlic broth they were cooked in, but in my opinion, they were somewhat overcooked. I just ate at Hot N Juicy the day prior and the mussels were much more tender over there. The flavors were great though.

Overall, I'd definitely go back, but I'd likely stick to the crab cake platter with hush puppies."}
{"text":"Omg!!! That's is the best sea food in las vegas... It is a must do when you come here"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Have since it opened on Eastern.  New location is roomy and even has gaming! They have great daily specials of fresh seafood that mainly I look up on facebook.  East coast oysters for a fraction of the price anywhere else.  These things are legit.  If you love fresh seafood without paying strip prices,  this is your place.  They are family run and have a very friendly staff.  Where can you get a whole lobster and two sides for around $20?!  They also participate on groupon and restaurants.com to give people a discount for coming in.  If you love Maryland sports they are always playing.  Great place,  great food,  great staff.  Will always be a local supporter!"}
{"text":"Place is so cool and friendly! Food is fresh from Maryland ... Taste is amazing!!! Must try!!! They educate you on the correct way to operate the crab to get the best crab meat!!!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has \"Fresh Live Blue Crab' flown in now you can't get any fresher then that!  LOL...  The service is good and food is delicious also the atmosphere is very casual too!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food. 
4 stars for the service and ambiance. 

My husband is a Maryland native and he had been wanting to go here for a while. This is a little far from our house, but since we were in town we decided to stop in. Fortunately we stopped in right when it was happy hour so we got a couple bucks off. We got ourselves a nice assortment of food including:

Crab cake - We only got a small one and it came free for joining the text club. This was really good and we should have gotten more!

Boardwalk fries - Eh maybe my expectations were high but these are no Thresher's fries (which they're modeled after). We actually had two batches and both were not as crispy as I was hoping. 

Crab soup - This was also just okay.  Kinda pricey for $5 for what you got. As it cooled it wasn't bad. 

Crab Cobb salad - Salad was flavorful and I appreciated how they separated all the ingredients so I could pick and choose what I wanted. I felt the crab meat they used for the salad was sub par. Kinda wish I got grilled shrimp instead after all the crab overload. 

Rockefeller Oysters - Not bad but not as big - or as cheesy - as they looked in the picture. 

Female crabs - We got an order of 6 small female blue crabs and I was reminded how much work they were. I was hoping for a more flavorful crab but I think I was a little underwhelmed. Some crab meat was more dry and some was juicier so there wasn't as much of a consistency. 

Oh - and they had video poker which was actually quite fun to kill some time while waiting for the food. 

Overall this place was worth a visit, especially if you've lived in Maryland and want some nostalgia. We will be back but probably get more crab cakes. And maybe try another seafood to balance it out."}
{"text":"Crab Corner is a comfortable and mellow spot to eat some crabs and other seafood at a not unreasonable price. The best times are when there is a special or Happy Hour. There is usually a good sports game on, and a good selection of beer. The crabs are pretty good, but can vary. The crab boil is fine and plentiful to share, but not spot on. It's not a problem, however. The collective experience is more of a kind of place that you return to because it is familiar and unassuming. It is fun to use a mallet to crack crabs with your chums. Don't overthink it! And don't compare it to what you get in Maryland, even if they supposedly fly the crabs in from there."}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best. The servers were really nice though a bit forgetful. The food was okay but nothing spectacular. 

So we were promptly greeted from the moment we walked in and seated in the bar. The waiter was nice and informative but he forgot my soup, so I never got to try it and almost forgot to take it off our ticket at the end. He also was a bit forgetful with the condiments and $2 crab that I ordered. 

First we ordered the mozzarella sticks. The marinara sauce was cold but the sticks were good.  The fried oysters weren't very crispy though big in size. The green beans were flavorful and the sweet potato fries though crispy were a little bland. The best part by far was the $2 crab. Since I had no idea how to get into it they sent another waitress over to show me the ropes, that was very kind of them. The crab was fun to eat and I got lucky and had one with lots of eggs. Yum! 

Overall this place was okay. If I'm ever craving crab is definitely hit up this place but stick with the crab entrees... I should've known, it's all in the name."}
{"text":"Good tasting food   , great location just off the 215 and S rainbow .

One issue I fail to understand is the service , its Friday evening and there are only two waiters making the service really slow.

overall its clean and food decent with decent prices."}
{"text":"Jeremy was awesome. Got a Groupon for bottomless mimosas and he made them extra strong for us. Awesome staff."}
{"text":"This place is located in the corner of a strip mall & is nothing fancy to look at but HOLY SHIT, THIS SEAFOOD IS FRESH!

My husband & I ordered shrimp sandwiches with the calamari appetizer and it was all SO GOOD. The sandwich had large pieces of shrimp & was tossed in fresh herbs, even the bread it was on was AMAZING. 

We weren't interested in many of the other items on the menu but this place is worth checking out for these sandwiches alone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their shrimp salad sandwiches & the OTHER crab corner location. The food is fresh and amazing but this 2 star review is for poor service.

Although this spot is larger, nicer to look at, and has a full bar, the service is absolute shit here.

Our server was also the bartender & her man-friend/boyfriend/guy she was totally trying to impress was chilling at the bar, taking all of her attention. She was standing there chatting with him, making him drinks, eating food & going out for cigarettes with him & completely ignoring her tables..... which sucks because there were only like 5 parties of people in the entire restaurant anyway. 

I will venture to the other crab corner location whenever I am in town & will avoid this one unless I feel like being treated like shit."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a seafood spot come in around the corner from my house but I was highly disappointed with Crab Corner. To start, they took our name on the back of a recites and seemed really disorganized. There were plenty of empty tables but lots of people waiting. After 20 minutes, which truly isn't bad on a Friday night, we got seated. Our waiter took our order quickly, we got the crab cakes, peeled shrimp and blue crab. The crab cakes were tiny, peeled shrimp was good, and the crab had very little meat for the $$$. Let's just say, we walked to Roberto's and each got 3rolled tacos to fill us up."}
{"text":"Got this on the group on really like it I'm from Biloxi Mississippi great flavor in the seafood. Very fresh the lobster was a little bit tough in the tale about the claws made up for it. Sarah was great ask for her station"}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed my meal and experience at Crab Corner. Ordered the Shrimp Alfredo with a side of crab legs and a glass of Moscato. The staff was attentive and personable. Prices were reasonable and what you would expect for Seafood. I want to go back for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Found a reason to check out Crab Corner thanks to Groupon. Happy to check out a place that dub themselves as the \"only authentic Maryland style Crab House on the West Coast\" that fly in fresh seafood daily! 

We arrived just in time for hour which they offer DAILY from 2-6pm. Bacon-wrapped shrimp, oysters on the 1/2 shell, calamari fries, crab pretzel... just to name a couple options. We ordered 2 orders of bacon-wrapped shrimp (comes w/ 3 per order), and $1 oysters off the happy hour and opted for the grilled shrimp ceasar and blackened mahi mahi which came in big enough portions to feed the boyfriend and I.

Service was great, there were about 3 people helping us out. Would help if we just had only one server (who introduced themselves) and 1-2 bussers just because we never knew who to ask. Although they were all willing to help us out, just got a little confusing. 

Known for their signature blue crabs which I'm still kicking myself for not trying, but we will definitely be returning for those and happy hour!

Kind of tucked away, but plenty of parking. Also liked that the bar was separate from the dining area making it family friendly. :)"}
{"text":"We've been here three times and I feel like it's just \"meh.\"  They have an awesome groupon for $29 that gets your $15 towards food and bottomless Bloody Mary, sangria, and mimosa so maybe that's worth the mediocre service, you get what you pay for.  That's available Saturday and Sunday 10-1.  Showed up at 9:55am on Saturday and doors didn't open til 1010 (guy apologized and said they were short staffed).  Had the crab cakes, crab pretzel, and BLT.  Crab meat is decent and BLT tomato were super fresh.  The real deciding factor on 2 stars is the slow service and they seem not to really care.  HOWEVER, Once Ashley got here the drinks wouldn't stop coming and she took us out to the hammocks with misters...she should get 6-7 stars and we decided we love her.  We will go back because of Ashley and the groupon."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. I found it by accident when I got turned around looking for something else. I came back a few days later with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised. Really my only complaint is that it's difficult to find. But the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great place and great environment. The lobster tank and fish tank kept my son occupied, didn't have to Chase him around.  Jeremy was our server and he made sure all our drinks was kept full. He recommended the crab cake and it was really good. Finally a real crab cake that's 90% crab and 10% cake, unlike others that's the opposite. Wanted to try the garlic sampler but they were out of blue crab, a lil disappointed but the service made up for it.  The crab pretzels and bisque was excellent, just the right amount of crab to complement the pretzel. For dessert, we got the chocolate cake and you might as well order 2 cause it went down in an instant."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in awhile. It's expensive, the fried oyster sandwich I ordered wasn't all that great and came on a very small bun, like one of those cheapo hamburger buns you'd get from the grocery store, and the service was by far some of the worst service I've ever received. Our waitress was scatter-brained, seemed uninterested to be working, and I caught her standing in the corner texting on her phone several times. She was excruciating slow and there weren't even a lot of other patrons there. If they were busy and the service was slow, I would understand. But there was no reason for the crappy slow service we received. She never came to ask us for refills on our drinks and we had to wait another 10 minutes for her to finally get around to taking our bill and running our credit card. She was unfriendly and it was just very obvious she didn't give a crap. I almost never leave bad tips because I understand servers receive most of their pay from tips, but I left a very small tip because she honestly didn't deserve a good one.

I may be willing to give this place another shot, maybe order something else from the menu. But if that girl is our server again, I'm turning around and walking straight back out the door."}
{"text":"This place services all of the major casinos. The management and staff are awesome and the food is great."}
{"text":"I would rate this 5 stars if I was into rating places that aren't full service 5 stars. This place is amazing! I very much enjoyed this, all of the food was excellent and the service was good as well. The crab was nice and fresh, the food was hot and served correctly. Seasoning was spot on on everything!"}
{"text":"This place was a waist of my $27.53 i had the crab legs they was dry and I had the rice was cold and I left hungry never again would I go back"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star, i would. We have dined her many times and love the crabs. Every time my mom comes for a visit, we eat there a few times. Well, mom is here and we went to get crabs. As we walked in, i noticed a sign on the door that said Primo Beer $2 pints. We sat, waiter brought us menus and took our drink orders. I ordered a Primo and he said \"we don't carry it anymore and we haven't for awhile\" to which i said \"why is the sign on the door\" He told he that he told management to take it down, but they ignored him. OK fine, no biggie. We ordered drinks, got then drinks and then waited to order...
....and waited....and waited....and waited. There were only 7 other tables and we watched our waiter go from table to table, refilling drinks, bringing food, cleaning off tables, brining checks, bringing back change and not only did he never come back to our table, he never once even looked our way. After 10 minutes of being ignored, we stood up and began to leave. 
As we got to  the door, the manager (I think) approached us and said \"I thought you had been taken care of\". We told him the waiter never came back to which he replied \"You should have spoke up\", said with an attitude.  WHAT?!??!?! We should have spoke up? Since when is it the patrons job to make sure the waiter or manager takes care of the diners in the restaurant . We would've easily spent over $100 tonight and i am certainly not begging anyone to take our money. 
The most appalling customer service or lack of i have ever experienced coupled with the most asinine thing i have ever heard a manager tell an unhappy customer means i will never be returning. I will also make sure to tell everyone i know, and i know a lot of people, to never, ever go to Crab Corner."}
{"text":"Called them to ask what's the special for today,the guy said there are really busy right now and told me go online check it out.lol"}
{"text":"You know those seafood places, that smell like seafood, but not in the good way?  This seems to be one of those places from my first visit here. The first impression this place left on me was...well,  that fishy smell, not off to a good start....... Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward.  Sure hope that was not the case. 

Cant remember the name of the server, we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check.  Now let me clarify, I do not expect to be served like a king, I am not a nose up type of person. However, when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by, then I started to question the service.

This brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive, scrawny little guys, 90% shell/breading, 5% meat, 5% grease/salt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good. 

I will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days. Im just hoping that this was an off day and not the standard at Crab Corner."}
{"text":"Asked what was best and ended up with the crabakes.  Was told there is only 10% filler which really helps make this a winner!  Don't know why any filler is used and maybe that's the reason for 4stars.  I have had a lot of these cakes in my life and most suck and this was tasty for sure.  The boradwalk fries were also very good.  Enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was excellent, as was the service. The kicker, server tacked on a gratuity to the check, for a party of 2. I have never seen this. Funny thing is, good food and service, we tip well. Servers tip would have been much more then the added gratuity. WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty mediocre!

Came here for happy hour one afternoon, and the whole place was pretty dead. We ordered a dozen of the happy hour special of $1/oyster, they were not only very small, but had no flavor to them at all. Since it was Tuesday, we also wanted to get the $2 crab special they are running right now, only to be told that they don't have enough crabs to fill that special. Somewhat of false advertisement. We ended up getting the normal happy hour $4 garlic crabs, and those were very meaty and I do recommend those. The crap dip pretzel $7, also on the HH specials list was pretty tasty as well. 

Since we were on a seafood kick, we got a pound of the steamed black mussels. They were kind of small, but the garnish and soup was very flavorful. 

I would come back for the crabs again, but probably not order the oysters or the mussels. easy parking, and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Blue crabs we ordered did not have a lot of meat, but still got charged full price. It was not cooked well also. Will not come back here."}
{"text":"Was craving crabs while in Vegas, but not interested in AYCE buffets or big crowds. Found this place on yelp and tried it out. Servers were friendly and laid back, atmosphere casual and no wait on a Saturday night (might worry some people, but i trust my fellow yelpers so I counted that a huge plus :) We ordered bacon wrapped scallops, onion rings, crab cakes, a lb of snow crab legs and a pulled pork sandwich. My date loved the scallops. I liked them, but would've preferred better bacon (the scallops were yummy and plump though). I will agree with the masses that the crab cakes were great and full of crab. Snow crab legs were delicious, pulled pork sandwich was huge and tender. If you're over the buzz of The Strip and looking for a chill place to get some tasty seafood (and other) grub, take a short drive and check this out."}
{"text":"AWESOME place! The one and only \"bad\" thing is that it's ALWAYS super busy! Heh, so wait time is a bit longer. Other than that, this place rocks! Great food, great prices, friendly people."}
{"text":"Having the opportunity to dine here while in Vegas was certainly a rare treat. I have heard many good things from friends and family and looked forward to trying the seafood. So glad It wasn't just hyped up nonsense! I genuinely enjoyed the seafood, down to the crab legs, the blue crab, the oysters, and clams. Very delicious indeed!"}
{"text":"Interesting that the highest recent review seems to rave about the potato salad, but not the crab or seafood. Stopped by here for dinner before dropping a friend off at the airport and then heading back to LA. Don't think I will be returning. Food is mediocre, soup was luke warm, everything we ordered (appetizers and entrees) all came out at the same time. Is it just me, but shouldn't  your entree come out after you have finished an appetizer?  I think management needs to get more involved. As I was leaving, I saw a 24/7 taco joint across the parking lot. I started wishing I had gone there instead."}
{"text":"I love he crap dip! It comes on bread and has a creamy taste and is so addicting. I'm here often for lunch. Great service too. Friendly staff and the food is always fresh. And if I have any issues, they fix it immediately. Love it!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant while in Vegas visiting. The seafood was fresh, prices were reasonable and the staff was also friendly. The interior decor was a bit off putting initially, but no worries, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I visited the Crab Corner last weekend with a large group in the early afternoon. It took maybe about 10 minutes for the gentleman to get tables set up for us but overall the service was courteous. The only complaint that I have is that it seemed like they were a little understaffed, which increased the time it took for us to get our food and drinks. 

As for the food, it was pretty good. I ordered a two entree combo (catfish and battered shrimp with fries). Everything tasted great and was not over-battered or greasy like other fried fish places.

I would come back to this place again the next time I'm in Vegas, but maybe later in the evening when there are more employees working."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We were ignored for the first 20m minutes. We got the Garlic Steamer Sample and half the crab was mushy. The crab cakes were good but you can tell they were microwaved. The clams were good. They had a nice broth in it."}
{"text":"Oh My..... Delish I tell you... Absolutely De-Lic-I-Ous!!!
 After moving to Vegas from Va Beach VA we've been looking for an authentic and affordable east coast style crab shack/restaurant. Now, after 5 years of searching we have finally found the place. It's called Crab Corner. I personally would like to call it \"Crab Heaven\" myself. In addition to the outstanding food we also had incredible service. Our very quick  and pleasant server's name was Kimmy & she was absolutely on point! She had an intelligent, knowledgeable answer for all of our questions. She also made some great suggestions to us regarding the different items on the menu. One thing is for sure, we will be going back to Crab Corner again in the very near future."}
{"text":"love this place. especially ther mussels and oysters! Jesse was great as well! he was really attentive and friendly! he anticipates our needs. didnt even need to ask! definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Wow was not expecting much from this place but it blew me away. Small and simple. Kind of a hole in the wall place ( in my opinion). But that SHRIMP PO'BOY!!!! Had my mouth watering with every bite. 


Their clam chowder was amazing as well. Just be sure to let it cool down first... hahaha

They have a small bar area which is awesome to grab a drink and catch a game. 

All in all this place was awesome! It lifted my spirits, filled me up and actually put me in a good mood. I'll definitely be coming back! 

CRABCAKES & FOOTBALL!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! The bacon wrapped scallops are delicious and the crab dip on point. This was my first time here and we were sat immediately and then greeted by our server (who was very knowledgeable and attentive), only to stuff our faces. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Them lil boogers can get pricey depending on what size and quantity you order.  The flavor is well.... Crab! All the seasoning is on the outside so if you deshell the meat and dip a bit on the outer crab, you get the J.O. Aka ol bay flavas.  Those real crab luvas out there know the sweet treasure that lies inside the main shell!!  Just like shrimp heads n crawfish noggins! Service was ok, but quick. Peel n eat shrimp was the best dish as there was more meat, the crabs are laborious lil suckas for a lil bit o meat... But it's an experience and an indulgence at that.  Overall 4 stars, it just wasn't real satisfying and no Bammmm! But  I would return if craving crab, Monday is AYCE @ $24.99, so may be a good value if you can crack alotta crabs! Typical side order fanfare, there is shuffleboard and bar if u wanna hang out.... Now I can say \"I got crabs in Vegas\"!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not too big of a fan of Crabs. However, I did want to try Maryland style crabcakes and I like to support local restaurants. The crabcakes were pretty good and according to my mom its just as good as the ones she had in Maryland. We also ordered the fried soft shell crab, which lived up to our expectations as well. The sides (fries, potato salad, corn) were delicious because they all had a homemade taste. We were impressed by the freshness of the seafood and I wouldn't expect anything less because they claim to have it shipped daily. The only true thing I would complain about is the table and chairs, although this is a casual seafood place they definately need an upgrade."}
{"text":"The food were alright a bit pricey. But the reason we weren't coming back at this place is because of the service. From the moment we walked in and by the time we were done. We got there and a guy (lets just call him \"J\") by the door just asked us how many were in our party, didnt even introduce himself, then my husband asked him if they have a booster chair and he said in reply \"no we don't, we only have a high chair\" in a rude way. So i thought he was just a hostess but then grabbed a menu then start walking away not even said, this way guys or follow me this way.. How rude... So we got at the table. I dont know how we got treated differently at this restaurant because other tables they put a brown paper cover but nothing on ours... Then we have left overs.. Husband asked for a box... Gave us one box for Our left over crab legs and more...AND of course it's not gonna fit in it.. O i have to asked for a plastic bag too.. What an oughful service, the worse ever... I normally doesn't leave but review but you \"J\" you need to change your attitude or better yet get another job that doesn't require customer service... And we were nice to leave you $10.00 tip.. But u deserve maybe a $1.00"}
{"text":"Moving to Las Vegas from Maryland, with a short 12 year stop over in Phoenix, we were looking for a place that felt like home.  This is the spot.  Been here two weeks, eaten dinner twice and caught the Ravens opening game.  Place was full of Ravens fans and we could not have been happier.

Ashley was the bartender and she handled the bar like a champion!  Slinging drinks with attitude the whole game!"}
{"text":"So delicious.  If you are in Vegas and like seafood, gig need to come here.  Nothing else nedd to be said"}
{"text":"THEE worst service EVER! Went last night for the Valentine's Day Special and we will never return to this location again. Called in advance to see if they took reservations and was told \"no just come in.\" Bad idea! The wait was 20mins even though they weren't busy half the restaurant was empty. Not only that, people are walking in with reservations! 

Once we were seated at a table with no serving ware we waited 17 mins for someone to take our drink order. Then the waiter comes and asks \"what are we eating?\" No introduction. No specials were told. Hell to this day I don't even know his name because he failed to tell us! 

Our order arrived in a timely manner although we didn't have anything to eat it with (still no serving ware) My water was now empty and I'm parched so we order the bottle of champagne. Wrong! Champagne served in wine glasses and there wasn't a chiller provided so the bottle sweats on the table and we're drinking warm champagne. Smh. For some odd reason an order of white rice came out with our meal and it didn't belong to us. It sat as we began to eat and the waiter returns with a bashful smile and says \"Uhhhh yeaaaaaa this isn't yourssss\" then proceeds to do a slow motion James Brown slide as he takes it to the correct table. Yes, he took it to the table as if it were a fresh bowl prepared for them. 

It's a shame that the food is great but due to the service I'll visit a different location and tell my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"Normally never eat everything on my plate but I couldn't get enough of the food here! The calamari was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The lobster was great also. We are from San Diego and have been looking for a great seafood place to eat and yes this is the spot. Jeremy was on point and made our time enjoyable and efficiently open a blue crab. Most of all very reasonably priced. Thanks for making my Sunday an enjoyable one!! See you guys soon."}
{"text":"Was a bit disappointed. First off I want to say the service was great. Tried this place as a recommendation from the bakery around the corner. The food is barely spiced, which is bland and boring. Got the garbage can lid filled with corn, crab, and potatoes. The last thing that really made me not want to return was that they decided to use the cooling of outside air by opening the front doors. The parking lot always smells like sewer vent gasses and that smell came right into the building. The smell made it hard to eat. Will try the other Crab Corner to see if it is any better."}
{"text":"I was skeptical coming here with the mixed reviews I have been reading about the bad service and the quality of food. We decided to give it a try anyway. We ordered just what they are known for...Crabs! They had the $3/large crab special. Ordered 8pcs, 2 orders of white rice, and lobster bisque.

First off, we were greeted promptly and seated right away as soon as we walked in. That was instantly a relief since those were some of the issues of patrons here. We were handed menus and order was taken about 7 minutes later by our very friendly server. 

Then our order came, as soon as I opened my first crab, it was love at first sight! It was meaty, full of crab butter, and steamed just perfectly!!! That just sealed the deal for us. Our server served all of our side dishes, limes, vinegar, drinks at one time so we never had to flag him for anything. We devoured and enjoyed our crabs dipped in spicy vinegar. 

This place was truly above and beyond my expectations. Everything went smoothly service and quality of food wise. Although, I cannot speak for the other items they have for their menu since we only ordered what they are popular for, and that is their crabs.  Yelp is a great source in our dining choices but it does not always determine the outcome of our dining experience. One customer might have a horrible time but it doesn't mean you will too. Sometimes people could be ordering items that are not really their specialty so you cannot really set your expectations high. I remember dining at a vietnamese restaurant that served one of the best Pho' but their Pad Thai was anything but great.  So always give a place the benefit of the doubt and stick to the highlights of their menu.

We sure glad we did because we have just discovered a hidden gem next time we crave for blue crabs at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Ashley is a great bartender, very personable! Food was good, peel n eat shrimp is better than the catfish. Happy hour is 2-6, can't beat that! Plus they have have an inside/outside bar. We'll be back to see Ashley, she even gave me a card with her schedule on it. That's a first & a great idea.."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  I've been here about three times, and make sure to get there on Tuesdays, so that I can take advantage of their $2 female crabs (also males when they have them)/$2 domestic beers special.  

They also have other specials (dine-in) during the remainder of the week: Mondays - 1.25 lb snow crab legs $14, 1 lb shrimp $14, 1 lb crawfish $5

Wednesdays & Thursdays - 1.25 lb fresh whole steamed lobster & 2 sides for $20.  

Even though I've been to some other seafood restaurants in the area, I really like this place. While there's plenty of parking, the restaurant itself is pretty small, so you'll definitely need to come early to reserve a spot.  I've arrived at anytime from 5:30pm - 6:30pm, and let me just say that the best time that I've been there is at about 5:30pm or just around 6pm.  Afterwards, it gets really busy and you'll be waiting for awhile.  Another catch is that the place closes at 9pm...I've actually been sitting and eating after 9pm, but they turn away people at 9pm.  Yes, I'm a slow eater...especially when it comes to blue crab.  

I've had the shrimp and the crab and definitely think they're both pretty tasty.  Growing up on the east coast, I remember making many trips just to get some blue crab in Virginia Beach and Maryland.  While it's not the same, I'll admit that it is a good substitute.  Hands down, their Baltimore-style seasoning is on par when comparing it with the \"real thing\".  For the price, you definitely can't beat this deal.

While they do offer sweet potato tots, which I've heard are really good, they now offer white rice, which is something that I do like to eat with seafood--especially with this particular spice.  I also make sure that I have some vinegar on hand too, just for the blue crab though.  

Hands down, this place does not disappoint...when it comes to $2 Blue Crab Tuesdays here.  As for the rest of the week and the other deals, I'm still waiting to check those out."}
{"text":"Y'all are crazy with this 3 and a half star rating!

Staff: attentive and amazing! Teamwork in action.
Food: I had the snow crab legs. My son had the fish and chips. I dare you to find a better fish and chips in Las Vegas. Fresh, not fishy at all. Batter was crisp ans delicious. Crab legs were meaty and firm, slightly sweet and dunked in butter and lemon were a delight.
Boardwalk fries were fun. Love Old Bay. Brussel sprouts were the best I've had in a restaurant and the corn on the cob was so good it was promptly inhaled. Hush puppies were on the good side of fair.
Paired with the seasonal Hef and some classic rock, HEEEAAAVEN.

Our server, Jesse was a standout star! Always on hand with good recommendations when asked. 
*sigh* I'm so FULL!"}
{"text":"dont come! u are better off. going to the seven eleven .food sucks !  way over price,
n service was ok! but the food dosent have flavor, condiments or anything. yeahhhhh jjst dont go , u will regret it"}
{"text":"This joint that was selling crabs from the port of Maryland did not disappoint. Being from Michigan, I expected a different quality of crabs here, but I was certainly not disappointed with the quality. The blue crab is a must try. It will have you reminiscent of what you're used to back home. Sort of like nostalgia!"}
{"text":"Crab corner left us feeling crabby. What a sucky experience this was. First, the waiter had to come back twice to inform us that our drinks weren't available. Bit annoying but meh, stuff happens. Then they get our order wrong and one dish didn't arrive until right near the end of the meal and only after we reminded the waiter repeatedly. Oh and another entree never arrived. That was moderately annoying but oh well. If the food was good this could be brushed aside. But it wasn't. The food was a big mound of mediocre. The crab was all shell and fairly tasteless. To top it all off the service was slow. So let's recap. Poorly stocked bar. Sucky service. Marginal food. Slow. 

One pro. The mussels were nice."}
{"text":"Being from Maryland this was a slice of home! Loved being able to eat some of my favorite foods from home like blue crabs, hush puppies, and snowballs! 

The service was as excellent as the food. We had a very pleasant server named Jared. Very attentive (our drinks never got more than half way empty) and he continued to check in with us throughout our meal! Highly recommend this restaurant and I'll make sure to visit every time we're in town."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem couple minutes off the strip.  Super fresh Blue Crab steamed to order 

I enjoy there very casual atmosphere , you sit on a bench table and they lay brown paper on it . 

Crabs come out steaming hot. Start cracking and picking"}
{"text":"I am divided about this place.

Prior to going, there was a lot of hype.  I had heard how delicious, how awesome.  As I lived in MD for six years, I was really looking forward to a great MD fresh seafood taste.

We went in on Monday and the place was pretty full at 5:45.  There was only one table at that moment that would fit all six of us.  My mother-in-law and I both had the crab cake, which came with two sides.  My husband had snow crab legs, my father in law had a combination plate, and both kids had the popcorn shrimp.

Everyone thought their food was fantastic.  The question really becomes is it worth the price that they charge?  I don't know.  The average cost per meal was $16.

I had a living social coupon, which took off $20.  Because there was 6 of us, they charged 18% tip automatically.  I paid before we got our food (so it won't be an issue with my inlaws playing the \"no, I AM paying\" game).  Later while we were still there, I thought about the tip amount and it seemed under what it should have been.  The guy charged me tip on the amount AFTER he took the $20 off, but then he charged me for two kids drinks when they were supposed to be free with the kids meal.  Hence, $5 that would have been the extra tip I was about to leave, was paid to the house for his error.  Oh well.

I am not sure if I will return.  There are a lot of great places in Vegas and I am not sure that I was bowled over by it."}
{"text":"Oh my God this place is off the hook Ashley and Jeremy our servers are bomb food is freaking amazing and fresh.  We will definitely be back we love you guys."}
{"text":"Very good service. They were out of clam chowdah but the substitute was crab chowdah. It was ok. I didn't care for the shredded meat feel in my mouth. Prefer the chunk feel from the clam. Also had the lobster roll. Again, just ok. Doesn't compare to Massachusetts but was tasty a day later and cold. The entire place was a hot spot for Maryland, so if ur from DMV, check it out. I'll wait for an MA spot."}
{"text":"I bet the crab is delicious!! I tried everything but the crab. The potato salad and hush puppies were good. And the beer battered shrimps too also good size. But pass the fried clam strips and fried oysters not the best and the lobster bisque  gave me the BGs =[ if you want lobster bisque get it at Aqua Knox in the Venetian!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night and ordered the lobster dinner. You get two sides with it when you go on Wed (I guess you have to pay extra for sides on other days). The lobster was good and bigger than I expected! The service was a bit slow but would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The blue crab was geat! Fresh, just like I remember when I used to eat it all the time growing up along the gulf coast of Texas. We were greeted by staff almost immediately when we walked in the door.  There were about 4 or 5 other parties waiting ahead of us and the place was packed with people who looked like they were enjoying their food.  We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes and sure enough, that's what it was.  It was worth the wait! We got a half dozen of the regular blue crabs but they gave us an extra one to enjoy! so cool.  Dave really took care of us, realizing we were Filipino, and brought out the spicy vinegar we know and love at home, and even offered us Red Stripe beer!  We really enjoyed the large, fresh, well seasoned yet naturally sweet shrimp and hushpuppies too!"}
{"text":"Yikes, I guess my review disappeared.  Came here after working out at the gym and since I've always drove past it on Eastern I figure this was the best time to try it.  I came here solo and in my gym gear (so I was ready to get messy) and got 2 large crabs and a lb of shrimp.  The shrimp was good and the crabs were too!  I've broken crab before so I had my own method of doing things but the people that worked there showed me how they normally do it.

Crab pro tip:  Take a leg or claw out and flip the crab over.  With the tip of the leg/claw flip the tail or bottom shell up and rip it out.  Then separate the shell from the body from behind!  Eat everything but the gills and shell!  And the hammer or mallot thing they give you is for cracking the claw!

Anyways, I found out that this will be the Baltimore Ravens bar on NFL Sundays.  How awesome for them.  Crab \"is greater than\" Crawfish, ahem.  But the shrimp was just a filler.   

Some people didn't make a mess of themself but I did, but I had gym clothes on so I didn't care!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! A little hole in the wall that your taste buds can't afford to miss! These people are absolutely from Maryland and know how to prepare crab every way possible! We had heard about it and stopped in for a quick lunch. I started with the crab bisque, which was full of meat and seasoned perfectly. I had the crab cake sandwich for the entree and OMG, so amazing! The service was great and we were treated like regulars. I can't wait to go back and get to crackin'!"}
{"text":"I walked in with my family tonight at 8:35p. The MoD turned us down saying \"takeout only between 830 and 9\". We are loyal, paying customers who frequent CC when in town, but were turned down tonight because they were prepping to close at 9p. Wow! If you want to close at 830, then don't advertise that you close at 9. You just lost plenty of loyal customers."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating blue crab. The staff was friendly and helpful with our cracking lessons, and the meat was delicious. I did find the poo-stuff inside the crab a little nasty looking, but I just did my best to scrape it out/wipe it off with a paper towel, and had no problems. The crab is a little expensive (we should have tried the Tues/Thurs deals!), but I think fresh blue crab anywhere is probably expensive. The main drawback for me was the sides. Potato salad and fries weren't bad, just didn't really stand out. Also, the potato salad was a small scoop served on a plastic dessert plate, which also seemed kinda lacking. The peel and eat shrimp were good, but not as good as what they serve at hot n juicy (nor did they have as many flavor options). Overall good, just not sure it was memorable enough to return.

We were in on a Friday night and the clientele tended toward the 50+ crowd. 
 
Bonus points for being locally-owned and in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere and helpfull staff. 

My first trip was more of an authentic blue crab experience after making an accedental discovery of blue crabs after a battle with them in a local seafood market and having to try them. 

I can say my attempts didn't compare to the style they do their crabs here. Next time I go I'll try the other stuff and update this review. 

The crab alone is a bit pricey, but worth it if you can get in for a game or something. Make sure you get a good side with your crabs if you get the small or females."}
{"text":"They had been out of crab almost a week by the time we visited! I would suggest calling ahead. 

Decided to give 2 stars because the service was actually not bad. We were in a group of six and the waiter got everything ordered in a timely manner and all the orders were correct. We had been planning this trip for a month and I was excited to try the Blue Crab. We learned from the waiter that they had only King Crab or Snow Crab, no Blue Crab at all. They hadn't had Blue Crab for 4 days. The menu and advertisements place a huge emphasis on Blue Crab being available for a variety of options, but to our disappointment a lot of the menu was not available to us due to the lack of Blue Crab. 

We ended up ordering fish, shrimp, oysters; they were mediocre at best. I can get deep fried seafood at many other places as long as they have a fry basket. The one thing that had the potential to satisfy me were the bacon-wrapped scallops but they were not very good either. They were small under-cooked bay scallops wrapped in bland fatty bacon. 

Unfortunately we will not be returning to this place and most likely will not try the location on Eastern either."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some good crab cakes, so decided to give crab corner a try.  (and glad we did)  WOW!!!!  Had EXCELLENT Crab Cakes!!!!!  Just couldn't get enough..

Our servers were very friendly & made us feel at home.

Going back 2nite to try another AWESOME dish.  I know we won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"So this review is a bit late, as I came in for Mother's Day. But, I just don't understand what all of the hype was about. The food was overpriced and uninspired. My server wasn't very attentive and I had trouble flagging him down. He didn't stop by our table once without prompting. It wasn't even that busy, honestly. 

As far as the food goes, I don't understand what people love. Granted, we didn't order the famous Maryland crabs, I expected much much more from what we did order. I have never paid such a high market price for crab legs. My crab cakes were dry and flavorless. The salad we ordered was thrown together and sloppy. My kids were even meh about the chicken fingers, and I feel like that hard to mess up. 

We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place, Ashley is the best! Make sure you check out the Maryland Crab Soup when you come.... ITS TO DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place for a while. Finally went there for dinner. The food was fresh & the prices were reasonable. Every night they have a different dinner special. Server wasn't very attentive but others servers made up for him. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had time to kill before work 1 day and Tuesdays happen to be 2 dollar blue crabs. 
Ordered 2 dozen (males)
The first bunch they brought out were all female:(. 
I didn't care for the sweet potato fries at all.
The crabs are on the small side.
Service was not special. 
The seasoning did not impress me too much either."}
{"text":"Got two appetizers, bacon wrapped scallops and mini crab cakes. Scallops were good but only four scallops and the mini crab cakes tasted great, but only four small cakes that really only tickled the tastebuds. Not sure how large the regular crab cakes are but for the minis, I guess the amount of crab meat in the mini cakes justify their price.
The main dish we chose was their soft shell crab platter. There were only three soft shell crabs.
The platter came with two sides, we chose the hush puppies and the white Maryland soup. Hush puppies were good. We don't get to eat this food type back home so it was great to experience it.
The white Maryland crab soup was really good, it's like clam chowder but with crab meat. Only thing, the temperature of the soup could have been hotter.
Our choices of the higher end foods may have been the reason we left still a little hungry.
Overall, this place had good quality food and I would like to go back and try more crab dishes."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot!!! Very rare that I find a seafood place that is true to its name. The lobster bisque was amazing. We had the garlic sampler which fed 3 of us (could feed 4). The frozen banana shake (alcoholic) was phenomenal. No need for me to have dessert. However, the fam had the waffle sundae skillet. Shout out to our waitress, Sarah, she  and the other staff took great care of us!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Seafood! 

Really needed something from the sea, so we finally checked it out. The staff was accommodating, welcoming and friendly. 

They have some great specials through out the week. You can't beat Oyster Sunday, $1 per, serves em up cold, fresh and with the best horseradish sauce ever. 

You can really get your bang of the buck with their pot specials. We didn't order (but next time) just a huge assortment of good eating. . Crab Corn Shrimp etc etc 

They serve beer , major A+ 

I also noticed they cater to the Maryland and Baltimore sports teams, come on order up and cheer on! 

Def check it out, plenty for everyone!"}
{"text":"I really like the female blue crabs we had as they were full of roe and sweet crab mustard (Tomalley). $35 for a dozen is pretty darn good. 

I will be back for more but next time, I know we will be there for at least an hour cracking and slurping the crabbies. 

We also had the special of the day - Crab cakes with very little filling. That was an awesome starter."}
{"text":"First time here was the best crab blue crab around we filled up on so much blue crab it was great will see you again soon thanks"}
{"text":"If you've never had the pleasure of bashing your dinner all over a table and eating the remnants with your fingers like a little kid, you should get thee to Crab Corner. I'd never had the true whole-crab-eating experience, but a colleague urged me to try it. The super cool dudes here very clearly explained the menu and the differences in the crab sizes, and then showed me how exactly to crack open the crabs once they arrived at my table. Being my virginal crab-eating experience, I limited my order to two large crabs, which, along with the addictive sweet potato tater tots, filled me up. Some people take issue with being hands-on or interactive with their dinner -- it can be hard to find pals who will go for, say, shabu-shabu or Korean BBQ -- but I'm all about the fun factor, and I didn't mind the mess at all. Furthermore, they've got sweet deals going every day, with Tuesday and Thursday being the best. (You can throw back non-domestic beers for $3 on Thursdays.) I'm not sure what Maryland natives would say about Crab Corner's authenticity or quality, but it sure works for me."}
{"text":"They hit a home run today.

I ordered mussels again.  They arrived piping hot. Delicious. They also had a lot of garlic--might be much for some people, but I liked them that way."}
{"text":"My mom raved that the Crab Corner had \"life changing crab cakes\"!  After hearing this I had to go!  I wouldn't necessarily say it was \"life changing\" for me but I enjoyed my lunch.  My husband and I split the 1 Crab Cake with sweet potato fries and a cup of their crab soup.  The crab cake is made of these huge chunks of crab, very little filler.  As far as size goes, I'd equate it to a 1/3 quarter cheese burger patty.  It's a pretty good size, probably the largest crab cake I've ever had.  The sweet potato fries were really good.  The soup was so hot!  My husband and I were a little let down on this...for some reason we were both expecting a creamy crab bisque soup.  The soup is more veggie, clear broth based.  Not quite what we were hoping for.

I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.  They have some good blue crab specials and other drink specials.  However, for the lunch described above, it was about $20.  Little expensive.  But if you're a crab fanatic like my mom...you better try this little crab shack!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch and hit happy hour just as it started. You can't beat it for the prices ($3 well/wine/beer) and $1 oysters daily from 2-6pm. Best yet is the Quality and Value for your money - fresh and flavorful. Fried oysters are amazing and perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside, plump and juicy on the inside. Service was friendly and attentive - AJ was great. Check out the daily specials (Mon-Thurs) including $3-$4 crabs, $19.99 lobster dinners, and don't miss the homemade bloody mary's!"}
{"text":"I came all the way from alaska,met Ashley and fell in love with the place. She is the nicest bartender I have ever come across in Las vegas. Defiantly will come back when I come back in town. If you live here,go say hi to Ashley, she makes the best bloody Mary in town."}
{"text":"Best place to visit before heading back home. I must say other than the good food our host (AJ) was very hospitable. Not sure if he is the owner but he sure holds the model of integrity for this establishment. AJ, sat down and put on some gloves just to show us how to eat more efficiently.

Ambiance: chill atmosphere suitable for large parties
Cost: Seafood at a fair price. Check for their daily specials."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the staff. Fell in love with this place the first time my wife introduced me. I always loved crawfish places and this is right up that alley. I wish Maryland style crab places were more abundant and around CA. Please remember crabs are still seasonal."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. But our server was never around. While turning into the lot we saw our soon to be server outside taking a smoke break. He had more smoke breaks then we had water refills for the table. I hate when they charge gratuity when you have super shit service. They dropped the check off then didn't come back for another 15 mins. And bro wash your hands if you come in fron outside. I hope the health department dinks your ass. Just cause we had a party of 7 with 3 kids dont ignore us. This town is full of industry people and you would have gotten more than you stupid 18% if you paid attention to the needs of your guests."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The staff was nice and I can see the attempt at being authentic - it has nice decor. However, the food all tasted frozen and the one fresh thing, Alaskan king crab legs at $29.99 for 2 legs - was extremely salty. My guest was convinced the iced tea was water it was so bland. My hunger was satisfied for about an hour."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time but i was a little disappointed with dinner. The food was great but the 65$ bucket of crab was not worth it. The service was great and i loved the enviorment but probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Place was good. Had the shrimp po boy, calamari, steam lobster and crab cake entree. Giving three stars only because food was good, but not exciting, meaning you can probably go to other restaurants and find it much better. It wasn't horrible by any means, and probably would go back because we live close.  

Service was fine, fun servers and friendly. Overall a good and decent neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed. I had the lobster bisque advertised as lots of meat compared to anywhere else, it had none...and calamari fries which weren't my favorite either. All in all I guess it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The bar was very small and crammed and I think the service left something to be desired. Eh. I would probably recommend trying something else personally."}
{"text":"Came for some bloody marys.
Stayed for the best bartender in town.
Ashley was so nice and made us feel at home.
Will be back for more bottomless drinks."}
{"text":"I loved this place, the staff is friendly and you can absolutely tell that they love their jobs and they are very passionate about what they do. today they had the 2.00 female crab special... however they were also offering 3.00 medium size male crabs. we went with 10 of the male crabs and between two people that was more then enough! absolutely killer seasonings, amazing flavor to the crabs.

we also ordered the sides of coleslaw which was very fresh and not overly creamy.. 

I can't wait to come back, this place is great."}
{"text":"Trying this place first time here.  Trying the crabs and shrimps will follow up after eating. Smells good though."}
{"text":"So very glad I purchased a Living Social deal to check this place out. I love seafood but I unfortunately live in a desert, so it is normal to be skeptical about fresh seafood. 

I brought my Dad here and we loved it. One of the staff members seemed to be new because he almost placed another table's food in front of us. He was also unsure about some items on the menu. We had the hot crab dip appetizer, I had blue crabs, and my Dad got a fried food platter. The app was amazing and cheesy and I had to not think about the amount of calories I was shoving in my mouth. I personally feel that breading and frying any seafood is a travesty so I didn't bother to sample anything on my Dad's plate. I had a great time whacking away on the blue crabs. 

The other diners were super sweet and everyone interacted with each other. Some were regulars and some were new because of the deal. It added to the appeal to have your tables very close together. 

The only reason why I had to bring this to 4 stars is because I attempted to go here once and it was closed. It was a Monday night when the Ravens were playing a Monday night game. Isn't this place billed as a Baltimore joint? My friend and I were disappointed that when we saw the sign that said that the place is closed on Monday nights during the winter."}
{"text":"Great place to watch Raven's games. Especially when they give out crabs when they score a touchdown. 

I am in love with their crab dip. I will be doing a random task and a craving for that dip will hit me. It is a little alarming but speaks to the power of that crab dip. 

We stayed for trivia after a Monday night game and we had a blast. The host was a great heckler. The only problem was that a team was sitting on the patio and clearly using their smartphones to find the answers. We discretely notified the host and his assistant but they did not do anything about it. No surprise here but that team did win. They won a big bar tab and left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars just for the oysters alone, everything else makes it deserving of the 3 stars I'm giving it.  Fried food is great and all, but when batter overwhelms the core it makes for an awful dining experience. 

We ordered oysters to start with.  Not usually a fan of oysters but these were surprisingly delicious. I was told these are fresh water oysters which gives it a different taste. A delicious one absent of that seafood taste a lot of people dislike, including myself. Even better: only $1 each on Sundays :D

They also have a pick two combo. I ordered chicken tenders and Alaskan cod with sweet potater tots and cold slaw. Both the cod and chicken tenders had little meat inside and I ended up picking off lost of the batter. Slaw was average and the only thing I found to be appetizing were the tots. 

I definitely give the employee props. It was Sunday and he was working alone but was still able to tend to everyone. 

Side note: I ordered ice water and it tasted like sea water, I believe this is because the cups are washed with other dishes and the seafood taste gets intermingled... Blech"}
{"text":"Last night I went to Crab Corner because of a Groupon that I had bought recently, otherwise I would have never known about this place.  Owners are 2 brothers from Baltimore and there represent Baltimore pretty hard... :)

I ordered the Garlic Hard-shell blue crab halves, 11.99 per lb (menu on yelp is a little outdated) comes with 2 blue crabs on a bed of rice, very tasty, love blue crab but watch out, those suckers shells are dangerous.. the first couple of bites or rice were good but I only took a couple bites, got too goopy.

Boyfriend got the crab cakes which comes with 2 sides; hush puppies and boardwalk fries (extra charge), but the sides are amazing... crab cakes had chunks of crab, he loved them.

Would definitely come back again... different then boiling crab or hot n juicy.... definitely worth a go. Next time I'm going for the dozen blue brab, and you get one free through yelp."}
{"text":"Worst experience ,Our FIRST waiter Jade took our DRINK order from the bar,She brought our apple Martini to the table,We told her that our drink taste like dirty water it was awful.She told us that she was sorry she would have another drink made,but they cant continue to remake our drinks,So me and my sister in law ,was scared for them to make the same drink,so we changed our drinks.So it took us a long time for our drinks to be re made.So finally the Bar tender brought our drinks,then it took a long time to take our order.When order was taken by another waiter,my sister in law ask what happen to our first waiter,she said that Jade got busy,the restaurant was slow,We felt like Sarah got upset with us because we didn't like our drinks .I went to the hostess stand to ask for canyons for my niece can draw while our food was being made. 

We ordered 1 kids meal,1 southern style cat fish dinner,1 pasta Alfredo with shrimp and grilled chicken.Our food came out,our new waiter Sarah notice that they forgot to put chicken on my sister in plate.So by the time Sarah brought the chicken my sister in she was finish.We told Sarah my sister was finish ,she still place the chicken on the table with a bad attitude.

So our check finally come,we get up to pay,the hosted ask us how was every,We told her that the food was awesome,Our service sucks.She ask what happen WE told her every that happen to us .Chillie was the cashier.I told her that i couldn't wait to Yelp our bad experience we had .          avoid this place at all cost,bad Customer service at it worst"}
{"text":"This place is crab heaven on earth! Only the freshest yummiest blue crabs that you could get in Vegas!!!

Devin and Grant offered excellent service : our sodas are refilled on time, our buckets emptied and they made sure we got everything we needed to enjoy these feast!!

We ordered also additional crabs to go and they packed it good for us - suited for our drive back home!!!

Definitely coming back!!! Excellent place and service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to go try this place since the pictures looked good. I was surprised that the place looked like a cafe/ college bar. We ordered the get dozen crabs get one free offer from yelp. The crabs were so good and sweet the meat was so white and it was delicious! !!! We also bought the 20 dollar lobster special and that was yummy as well. The service was on point even though it was one guy working there he was helpful and brought us refills. This place is well worth the price. Found a new place to eat blue crabs."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  My fianc√© loooooves Maryland blue crab, and she got just what she wanted.  She also taught me how to crack em the right way ;) Today was Thursday and they had $3 beers plus $3 crabs.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Las Vegas I stop by this place. Even though I've never seen the same face twice, every face I see is friendly and very cool. I always get my crab and shrimp to go and they always take care of me. 

The prices are a little steep but that's only because they have the crab flown in. I only bring it up for the people who want to know. I have never once considered not going because of the price. Although... one day I hope I can get the large sized crab and not only the regular. 

This is easily my favorite place to eat in Vegas and I can't wait until I go back."}
{"text":"Crab legs were so good with their seasoning that I NEVER eat it without the butter and this is my first time I skipped the butter! D-LISH! It's the seasoning! Had Corn on the cob that was tasty and steamed clams that I just let swim in the broth. They were a lil small but they give you a big bowl of them. Have raved about them on my FB post and have had friends ask about the place! Will go many more times again!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the food based on coworkers recommendation, but his experience was on the east side of town. Ordered steamer sampler and salad. The order came out quickly, the waiter was somewhat attentive. Food was sub par, did not taste very fresh and was very bland. Don't think I'll be visiting again or taking my coworkers recommendations. P.S. Prices are outrageous compared to the quality of food. Probably better off trying Joe's Crab Shack if you need a seafood fix."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but the service was so bad I needed to. I have never had more terrible service in my life. We arrived on Tuesday at 6pm and it was not busy. We put in our first order and it was crab, we asked how long it would take, they said 15 minutes, no longer than 20. 6:25 comes by, no food, but another party of 6 comes in and they were American. (Mind you we are Asian with a party of 5) They put in their order, 15 minutes later they got their food immediately along with their crab. I went to the front desk and asked the server what was taking so long, it's been 40 minutes and he said I have no idea it's up to the kitchen. I asked if I can talk to the manager and he replied I am the manager. So we put in another order of lobster, mussels and other food. Waited until 7, everything else came but the crab. So we just paid for the food and left. My boyfriend was able to talk to the actual manager. We explained everything that happened and he replied \"I don't know, come back in tomorrow\" ? 

We are in the food industry as well, so we know what it's like and we tip very well. I am never coming back again. Their are plenty of other places where you can get  and good service. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"What a Great Buy! Purchased a date night package and enjoyed every minute! This whole in the wall was a great find! Walked in and was greeted by their super friendly staff and just as promised got my bottle of Chardonnay two wine glasses, and my chilled ice bucket, next was the appetizer soooo yummy came out nice n HOT double bonus points for that , once we devoured that it was time to pick from there date night entree choices  (pick one) 
Salmon ,Chicken Alfredo , Crab legs or lobster (they allow two side per entree) oh and it doesn't end there my friend you now get to choose your dessert to share me n my boo chose the chocolate fudge brownie with vanilla bean ice cream ....needles to say this won't be our last time going to visit Crab Corner while in LAS Vegas this will def be a spot we check out again ! Thank You Crab Corner for making our experience a great one !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their happy hour and it was fabulous. Our servers were friendly and attentive. They kept checking on us to make sure we were happy and I'm glad they have great customer service here. My friend and I ordered off the happy hour and we came here on a Tuesday so it was $2 blue crab all day as well. They have daily specials for each day of the week you go to. We ordered 2 dozens of oysters, the mini crab cake slider (it comes with homemade potato chips if you order 2 sliders), bacon wrapped shrimp, chicken wings, and 4 blue crabs. Everything was delicious. I was so happy and pleased with their oysters. It was so delicious and fresh. You can't beat $1 oysters that are fresh as the ones here at crab corner. The blue crabs was good, but I wish they had more juices in the crab but it was still good. Although it does take some work to get into the crab so if you patient and work hard to open your crab, it's worth it. Definitely recommend coming here for happy hour if you're a seafood person."}
{"text":"I have blue crab and mussel delivered from amazon restaurants last night. For how long the travel was presentation was still decent. Flavor of the blue crab was interesting. Caramelized onions with a lot of butter and garlic..? It's got a nice sweet/savory twist to the dish. Mussels are just pretty good too, assuming its garlic butter. I'd go during actual happy hour one day and what that's like."}
{"text":"Great service the bar tender is so good at remembering your name and attentive!  Crab cakes were just like home - Maryland but could be a little spicier.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I found out our server last time (1st time) was Mark, the owner. I had to come back after such an amazing first trip. This time was still great though I couldn't veer too far from my choices last visit. This place is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here and already can't wait to go back!! Really friendly service, food was very tasty! So many great seafood choices-baked fried sandwiches soups really good beer and wine selection as well!"}
{"text":"This is a great no frills spot for delicious crab. I definitely prefer this location to the Eastern location because the area around the restaurant is better and the dining area is more spacious. 

Our preferred starter is the mini crab cakes. I definitely can't complain about lack of crab here. These crab cakes are almost all crab and have very little filling. The crab here is reasonably priced and very fresh. It's also prepared perfectly so it's easy to crack the crab and get to the meat in no time. The sweet hushpuppies side is generously portioned and delicious. The flavor is great and they have a nice amount of sweetness. 

The restaurant is very sports oriented so I would suggest avoiding this place on a Saturday or Sunday during football season. It says a lot about their crab if I can sit through sports to eat my crab."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop in but had that raven banner up just can't do it !"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the bacon wrapped scallops, blue crab, and garlic steamer I believe. Also had some oysters on the half shell. Everything is pretty good! Only thing for me was some of the crab from the garlic steamer were old or over cooked. The meat was real mushy. Next time I'll just do the Dungeness Crab with garlic since that was the must fresh and plump meat. Other than that I'd go again. Maybe next time I'm in town. Eat it. Or I will. #11"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service this place is on my top 10 of best foods in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"1st time here. Staff was friendly and attentive to our table.  Ordered crab soup, crab pretzel, crab cakes with roasted Brussels sprouts, and steamer clams and mussels.  All good.  Will come back with more friends to try the steamer platters."}
{"text":"I'm from Virginia, so when I found this place was sportin' Maryland Blue Crabs, I had to stop in. I was not disappointed. 

The atmosphere is cool and casual with a sports bar feel to it. It's covered in Ravens, Orioles, and Terps gear. We opted for an inside seat, but we noticed that outside had cool hammocks. Bucket list item for when I come back. We got a couple of beers. They had a decent selection, and we're kinda craft beer snobs. 

I ordered 5 regular and medium jimmies (male crabs). The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they serve fresh sooks (female crabs) on their all-you-can-eat special. Now, I get that a lot of people prefer the sooks, but from an ethical perspective, I just don't jive with this business practice. If you are going to offer sooks, limit it per customer please!

Enuff soap boxing! The jimmies were GREAT. Boiled perfectly with tons of Old Bay seasoning. I took my time with them. They bring out all the tools you need and cover the table, so you can get your pickin' on. Our waitress, Kimmy, was THE BEST. Super friendly, hilarious, and made great recommendations. The people here are people you'd wanna hang out with. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great meal.  Had 2 crab cakes. Nicely done. I grew up in Baltimore and I would know. I just moved to Vegas and I will be back!"}
{"text":"After visiting this establishment with much anticipation I was very disappointed. I ordered the soft shell crab with 2 side dishes, I had the sweet potato fries and coleslaw. When my order arrived I was struck with the smell off \"old\" grease which soaked my crab. The soft shell had not been cleaned properly and every bite you had a mouthful of cartilage, awful just awful, the only thing I ate were the sweet potato fries. I will never return here again, I work hard for my money, I don't like  to throw it away!"}
{"text":"Went with the living social $13 for $25 deal.  Ordered Calamari, a pound of little neck clams, and boardwalk fries.  Plentiful serving of calamari lightly breaded and complete with two sides of marinara.  The clams came in a bowl with bread service.  The sauce was garlic butter and made the clams delicious!  No need for extra dipping butter with these lil guys.  The fries were also fresh cut style and very good with the table side malt vinegar.  Table also has hot sauce and the crab seasoning.  Happy hour 2-6 daily with $3 well, draft, wine.  Great job by our server keeping the iced tea flowing as well.  Only downer was the temperature in the dining area.....frosty!"}
{"text":"The crab cakes are killer. great service.After a 4 hr skateboarding sesh @anthem left crab corner full and happy !"}
{"text":"Steamed crab was sweet and juicy. This was definitely one of my favorite crab places!"}
{"text":"Mini crab cakes that are pure deliciousness,  creamy crab dip and perfectly cooked seared salmon on angel hair pasta ..beautiful meal. Great service and family atmosphere.  Highly recommend to get your seafood fix!"}
{"text":"I been here so many time I love eat crab but today is really disappointing me .the crab is empty inside !i living close to this place but I really disappointed this time ,sigh .and the mussels taste is not the well"}
{"text":"Finally went to $2 Tuesday at this place. It gets busy on this popular night, but nothing too ridiculous. It's a small joint but it packs an amazing flavor punch.  We ordered some fried oysters, crab dip, sweet potato fries, and a dozen crabs (the best part).  

It's a fun place to just hang out with friends and get dirty.  The fried oysters was a very substantial serving.  The oysters were fresh and like silk with a crunchy.  The sweet potato fries were cooked just right and perfect with the extra Chesapeake seasoning they put on the table for you.  The crab dip was surprisingly good, I expected a very standard too much mayo/cream cheese not enough crab situation.  But, it was full of crab and had a great creamy savory flavor on lightly toasted bread. The crabs were perfectly cooked and the taste was on point.  At $2 a pop, I will weather the Tuesday crowd for these lovely crustaceans.  

The guys working were friendly and we got to chat with them towards the end of the night  Will definitely be coming back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Family and I decided to try this place out. Went there on a Thursday night. There were several patrons eating. They had a special $3 crabs on Thursday and decided to order a dozen of crabs. Along with that, we ordered oysters, calamari and shrimp.  The food was delicious. We finished the whole dozen crabs along with the others that we ordered.  There was a bit of sticker shock on the oysters.  It was ridiculously over priced for only 6 pcs.  We will continue to eat there as food was really good and very casual. They recommend you use your fingers and hands to eat."}
{"text":"I can't give it five stars as I only order steamed crabs, but the steamed crabs are FIVE STAR ALL DAY LONG!

Service is good, extensive beer menu (very important when eating steamed crabs), and the crabs are as good as Captain James and other places in downtown Baltimore.  

The menu does have some really awesome specials we will try once crab season is over. 

Very casual atmosphere.  Would like it to open at 11 am, as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"Superb crabcake and soft shell crab sandwiches for lunch. Crabcakes had great crab flavor with plenty of crab without filler. They came with freshly made thick cut potato chips - super crunchy. The Crab Corner is well worth the trip from the Strip."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem in the southwest. The bartender Sam is one of the best in town. He always makes sure my glass is full and his customer service is outstanding. I will be back."}
{"text":"Seriously LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Omg I can't... !!! They're just so damn good. We like to go and share the sampler... But I can't remember the exact name of it..  It's clams, mussels, corn, shrimp, and the blue crabs on a trash lid.. Omg so so so good. If you haven't gone in to check them out make sure to do so. They're amazingly yummy. 3 thumbs up"}
{"text":"The staff was nice but the food was very mediocre. Crawfish was very boring compared to something you would get at hot and juicy or other local spots. Also I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh crawfish even though I was told it was. Sorry guys really wanted to like it but just not for me, really left feeling unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Boyfriend has been wanting to go here - he got two lobsters as it was on special and I got the Hawaiian seared ahi tuna. My order took literally forever and I didn't get my food until after boyfriend was finished with his lobster. But the manager/owner dealt with it just fine by bringing me a free glass of wine and then also not charging for the tuna as it took 45 minutes. It was worth the wait, very tasty, tuna was very fresh. Everything had a wonderful flavor. Boyfriend was happy with his lobster so we will be back. They are opening another location on the SW side of town so I am looking forward to checking it out."}
{"text":"While searching through Yelp, I found this gem close to my home. Wow. I have been missing out. Hands down, the BEST salmon I've ever had. I'm very impressed!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh seafood this is the place to come.  They are a little pricey but the food is worth the price and if you leave here hungry its your own fault.

The staff is very friendly and helpful especially if you do not know exactly what or how to order.

I had the crab cakes which comes in an order of 1 or 2, I got 2 with sweet potato fries and they were not only amazing tasting but very filling.

People we were with ordered a platter for 2 and could not finish it there was so much food...This platter can actually feed 3 or 4 which for $49.99 that is an amazing price.

This place has to have good food because they are always crowded and sometimes it does take a little long to get the food but everything is cooked to order.

If you have never been here, I say give it a try but if it is crowded, please be patient because it will really be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par. Most of it isn't fresh. It's frozen/pre-processed. The place was dirty and the servers were inattentive. There were four in our party.  We all ordered something different, but all agreed our meals were really less than thrilling. The whole experience was under-whelming."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was born and raised in Maryland, so he was absolutely stoked when I found this place on Yelp. 

Crab Corner reps Maryland so hard. Their cool flag is hung up everywhere. And sometimes the staff will wear their funny, punny, \"I got crabs in Vegas\" shirts. Hey, do you sell those? 

We usually get the garlic steamer sampler and it is worth the money. I should say that if you go with someone from Maryland, be prepared to not eat most of the food, because they're absolute wizards at cracking open the most difficult of crab parts. I struggle and attempt to use my tools, but when I succeed, the delicious crab meat is always the greatest reward. 

The price is great for the amount of food you get. This place is awesome! Will definitely continue coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful!  The crab is outstanding and everything is so fresh. I took my parents for dinner because they love crab. They absolutely love crab. They were very happy. 

The pulled pork sandwich is ok for a seafood restaurant, but the crab is on the level of much higher priced restaurants.

The atmosphere is fun and open. Not stuffy and boring. I suggest a visit if you have never been."}
{"text":"Came here because I purchased a living social deal that I couldn't resist.  I work near this place and have been wanting to try it out.  

Its pretty similar setting to other \"Crawfish\" joints.  I guess when I thought of crab I was thinking Dungeness Crabs versus Blue Crab.  BUT on that note, the blue crab you get a choice of choosing Female or Male crab.  We chose a dozen all female and there were 4 of us digging in, and we still had left over.  Blue crab is a little bit more work, but let me say these blue crabs are pretty big and full of eggs if you eat eggs.  I do, with rice and dip the crab in vinegar sauce (which you have to ask for)...so Asian of me, LOL. 

He threw in an extra blue crab and glad I had that deal from living social.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the crab cakes are a must.  It really is made of crab pieces, and the only way I would eat crab cakes.  Its a bit expensive, but definitely worth trying and devouring!  

We got the manager's info handy in case we ever want to order from his Point of Contact for Crawfish, crabs, etc.  We like to have crawfish parties in the convenience of home every now and then!

Great place to go to other than the ones in Spring Mountain, no wait when we went."}
{"text":"Crabby Mary, mini crab cakes, bacon wrapped scallops, oysters and female blue crab.  I'm in heaven!

I've been craving crab for quite sometime, and what better place then Crab Corner.  I think it's great that they are on this side of town.  This place is bigger and better then the one on eastern.  They have a full bar and televisions to catch the games.  Perfect for when they do happy hour specials.  That's everyday!

If you check out my tip, you will see the happy hour times.  Service here is fast and friendly.  I really like the added menu.  I come here for the blue crab and their crab cakes.  But with so many things added,  I might just venture off.  

Delish, check them out!"}
{"text":"Crab Corner is an awesome restaurant for any blue crab lover! This was our first time in Vegas. When traveling we always try to find at least one restaurant that has blue crabs. When I found crab corner online, I was determined to dine there. The reviews stated the owners were from Maryland and that anyone who loved blue crabs should visit. We ordered the shared platter. It included 1 1/4 lb blue crab, 1 1/2 lb steamed shrimp, 1 lb dungeness crab, 1 lb snow crab and corn. We ordered a side of the best sweet potato fries we have ever had. The price wasn't bad. I would recommend Crab Corner to anyone who is looking for well seasoned crabs and great service !"}
{"text":"On this double date with Blair B. and Mike B., the guys had no say in where we decided to go - Blair and I had both bookmarked Crab Corner so that was our destination!  Mike B. is from the northeast and he is a big fan of fresh seafood.  We ordered a pound of large crabs (special was 50% off $70 for those), a side of sweet potato tots, mini crab cake appetizer, and Eric R. got corn on the cob.

The crabs were heavily seasoned but luckily not crazy-garlic-ish like hot n juicy's seasoning blend.  Eric R. was less than thrilled about working for his meal, so he was whiny the whole time and lamented that he did not order the crab cake platter for his meal.  The crab cakes we tried were all crab, no filler, so that was positive.

There was a sign on the wall next to me that told us how to open the crab for maximum eating pleasure.  I got this down easily and malleted my way into the legs, making perfect cuts each time.  I really dug the sweet potato tots too because they were basically little mounds of sweet potato fried in batter, rather than shredded and made into tots.

After that, Mike bought a Tastykake so Eric R. then bought one too and he ate his for dessert inside the restaurant.  When we got home, we realized we had a 10% off coupon...woops!  Overall, hot and delicious crab and a fun, interactive and messy dinner with friends - what's not to like?"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on Valentines day. We were seated promptly and our server was very nice and accommodating. We ordered the mini crab cakes as an appetizer... and they are VERY mini. It was served with 4 and a side of tarter sauce. We were told they were about two bites each but in reality it's about one. They were very good, almost no filler and all crab so I wasn't too upset about the size. 
   For dinner we shared the Steamer Sampler with includes one pound of peel and eat shrimp, one pound of Dungeness crab, one pound of Snow crab, three whole blue crabs and two ears of corn. For the price (market) it was a pretty good deal. It was more than enough food for two people. 
  I would go back here again to try their other menu items, but wouldn't get the sampler again. I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place since we are originally from Maryland and we can't seem to find a place in this valley that has a clue how to make crab dip! Apparently, this place cannot either. If you are from MD, the crab dip is NOT MD crab dip. There was no cheddar on top, not creamy. It tasted like it was just zapped in a microwave. It even had a smell which should have been my warning to stop eating it. The MD crab soup was ok, not as good as stuff back home, with a good amount of old bay. The crab cake had cartilage that I had to stop and pick out. Neither the crab dip nor the crab cake had old bay. I asked for old bay chips and there wasn't a speckle of old bay on there. Service was friendly and quick, but the quality of food literally landed me in the bathroom all night vomiting and on the toilet. Probably old crab....very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to the Crab Corner for the first time about a month ago.  Both the husband and I were very impressed with the quality and taste.  We ordered the 1/2 pound of shrimp, king crab legs, little neck clams and all you can eat Maryland blue crabs.  Oh yeah and it came with 2 sides...we chose sweet potato fries and jasmine rice.  

Very pleased with what we ordered and the service was excellent.  Our bill was well over a hundred dollars and well worth the price.  This isn't a fancy place, but when you're shucking crab and using your hands to eat, not a big deal.  

We will definitely be back when we visit Las Vegas again!  Give this place a try if you like seafood, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. As someone else mentioned, pretty amazing to get this stuff on the West Coast.

Garlic crabs were excellent, steamed mussels excellent, and crap soup was also excellent. Maybe a bit expensive if you don't go when they are running specials, but definitely a very tasty meal. They say the seafood is all alive when you order, so it might take a while when they are busy."}
{"text":"Good food, great crabby hour and Ashley was super amazing. Our group sat on the patio and we all had separate tickets. Ashley was friendly and accommodating to all of our quirks. We are only in town for another week and we will be back.."}
{"text":"Fancy Vegas restaurants?  Please.  Give me some crabs and some hammers any day.
After the first night, all I could think about was going back and smashing more blue crabs.
My order was simply a shit load of female blue crabs and some corn.
When they brought the crabs to my table, it was like love at first sight.  
I knew from that moment, my taste for this crab would be obsessive and that's all I would think about until I get it again.  They were loaded with seasoning and served with garlic butter.  Simple yet amazing.

The next day approached, Vegas was a sweltering 109 degrees.  First thought in my head, \"Today is a good day to smash some crabs.  Again.\"

This time around, the lust and infatuation had passed and I was able to think with a clearer head.  While still being delicious, these blue crabs are a pain in the ass to open up and eat.  It will take almost $50 of crabs to feel remotely full.  While as tasty as it is, don't expect to get a full belly off these critters unless you don't mind working for it.

Service was excellent and it wasn't too crowded. Will have to return again to slay more clawed monsters."}
{"text":"Seriously  thee best crab cakes ive ever had. Will be back here my next  visit  to vegas for sure!!! Had crab cakes...onion rings and sweet potato  fries...I'm stuffed"}
{"text":"I had this craving for crab cakes for weeks now, with practically a desperate need to fulfill it tonight. So my beau and I entered \"crab cakes\" in Yelp's search engine looking for a place not too far from our house.

We came across crab corner. From the pictures, it definitely caught our eye and we were willing to try it out.

Upon arrival, the place looked to be straight off of the Maryland Boardwalk.
 The smell of old Bay let me know I was in the right spot for my craving.

We ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops. With the apricot chutney and a squeeze of lemon, it was the best part of our meal. 

For our main entrees, I had the crab cake platter with hush puppies and beer-battered onion rings. The beau ordered the 2-item combo with beer-battered shrimp and Alaskan cod with a house salad and French fries. It is Tuesday so we took advantage of the Day Special $2 Blue Crabs.
\"Growing up on the Mason-Dixon Line, I know what Maryland blue crabs are all about, and this place does a decent job of trying to replicate the flavors  from the Chesapeake,\" says my boyfriend.

Our bill ended up being around $60 before tip.

The food, although nearly authentic-tasting, was not enough to write home about. The fried food, with a heavy batter that overpowered every item we ordered, turned out to be too much for our stomachs to handle later on.

We would have LOVED to LOVE this place because Ivan and the manager were very accommodating and kind, but the service was better than the food itself."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food. Everything was over cooked and was battered heavily- extremely greasy. Won't return."}
{"text":"What A delight to find Crab Corner!! My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to eat dinner and seafood sounded amazing, I found Crab Corner on the Internet.
What a wonderful surprise to find this hidden gem in the corner of the plaza appropriately named.
We ordered a crab dip that was served on baguettes for an appetizer, phenomenal! We had to force ourselves to stop eating them so we could enjoy our main entree.
I ordered the fried clams with a side of brussels sprouts and garlic green beans. The clams were incredibly tasty with a nice surprise that they were clean.. no grit or sand.
The tartar sauce was on point as were the sides.  I did try a sample of the coleslaw but it wasn't quite to my liking. 
My boyfriend ordered the Crabby Cobb which was a gorgeous salad filled with all of the goodies a salad should have.. they aren't skimpy by any means with anything.
I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was also very good, no complaints here.
We finished off our meal with a snow cone type dessert 'pina colada'... not bad!
I highly recommend taking your family, friends, mate, co-worker, or just bring yourself. The prices are outstanding for what you are served, and the menu is complete...
We took a long time to get it down to a few things.. They have a full steamer menu, po boys, land lover food, desserts, full bar, tons of space & for no good reason not busy.
Do yourself a favor and try them immediately 
Fifty 's"}
{"text":"I kind of have mixed feelings about this place. A lot of the reviews mention how bad the service is, and when I walked to the door I was thinking just that! We were standing waiting for someone to acknowledge us for about at least four minutes. There was not a host and the other employees were just walking by without doing anything about it! 
When we finally got a table we got served by  the bartender and she was great! She checked in with us several times during our meal and gave us a good service. 
The food was good, I totally recommend the crab cakes and the lobster bisque. My boyfriend ordered the Maryland grab soup which was flavorless! So truly, this place is good and bad at the same time! I cannot make up my mind!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time. We came on a Saturday for an early dinner (3:45p). Aside from the bar, there were only two tables occupied. It took a couple of minutes to be seated, and the hostess had trouble finding a clean table. The server was quick to take our drink order; however, he told me that he had to check to make sure they had the stuff to mix my drink. Which is fine - i get that, but he disappeared for 10 minutes after that and never confirmed whether or not I had to choose a different drink. I watched him flirt and socialize with different employees before he returned to our table with drinks in hand.

After that we had to wait an additional 10 minutes to have our order taken. The food came pretty quickly after that. The bacon wrapped scallops were really tasty, but you only get 4 scallops that were on the small side for $14, so it was a bit overpriced. The lobster bisque was very well done... would have preferred more lobster chunks instead of the slivers, but I was grateful for what was there compared to the crab soup that my spouse got. There wasn't any discernable piece of crab to be found in the otherwise tasty veggie soup. Maybe it was just the portions we were given... not sure.

We ordered the garlic blue crab, peel and eat shrimp, homemade potato salad, and onion rings. The potato salad was excellent! The onion rings were battered nicely, but they would have been much better if paired with some kind of cheese dipping sauce. When we asked for that, we were told that the only sauces available were salad dressings, which was disappointing. The shrimp was tasty, decently sized and portioned for the price. We were rather disappointed with the crab. We were given 3 blue crabs smothered in a garlic sauce. Maybe blue crab is small in nature, but the actual meat inside the crab was mushy and difficult to extract from the shell. We are used to eating snow, dungeness, and king crab, so we didn't really consider the crab to be an accurate reflection of the restaurant's abilities. 

As we live in North Las Vegas, and stopped by this place because we were in the area, I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon. However, if a location opens up closer to us, we would consider returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why they have only 3 1/2 stars, but this place was great. I had the catfish po-boy with homemade chips. It is hard to find good crabcake and it was excellent here. My friends also enjoyed their meal. However, the service could be much better and more attentive. When we were seated on Monday evening, the female host only brought us two menues for three people.  We kept on having to ask the server to refill drinks and order more beer; plus extra napkins, etc.....Hence, the server should be asking us.....They need a good manager who pays attention to the front as much as the back to solve this problem."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.... I was a little weary when we showed up to see the empty place but lured by some great reviews of the Happy Hour oysters for $1 each, why not. Huge mistake. We ordered a couple other fried items that were tasteless. 

The guy, Richard who took out orders and brought the food out was probably having a bad day?  When he dropped off the food, he just left and didn't check back on us until he brought the check and clear out the plates. Oh and we couldn't flag him down as he was either chatting with someone at the other end of the room or he would have his head buried in His phone at the front desk.  

So when I finally had a chance to catch his attention on my way to the bathroom and he was carrying the empty plates back to the kitchen, I asked him why the oysters were so shriveled and dry, with no brine AT ALL... his response? Oh we fly it in fresh and it's not dry. I pulled up the pics I took of the horrible oysters and he then somewhat looked like he would say something to \"fix the issue\" BUT to my shock, he blurred out: \"why did you not tell me before?\" Ugh!  Really?  It's my fault that you didn't do YOUR job and served us old lame dry oysters & you still blame it on me for saying something in hope you would fix it and not get a scathing review?  Richard had a chance to remedy a bad situation. Instead he chose to blame it on the customer. 

STAY AWAY and avoid this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Not only were the soft shell crab sandwiches amazing, but the customer service received while at the restaurant was impeccable! I also needed a copy of my receipt emailed to me and the manager got right back with me in a such timely manner that really saved me from a trip across town. 5 stars for the food and 50 for the service!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down this place is bomb! Im no east coaster but I love it...if your not down to get dirty this might not be the place for you. 100% recommended, try it for youself!"}
{"text":"Major letdown! When you advertise that you have crabs flown in daily, you should have them flown in daily.  Spent money in a cab ride out from the strip and ended up having a grilled cheese.
Do not make the trip to Crab Corner- you will not be happy with this choice at all.
Website is VERY misleading! Poor choice."}
{"text":"A Maryland crab house, located in the desert - what will they think of next? On Thursdays, medium crabs and all bottled beers are $3 each.  We ordered 6, crabs, not beers, plus sides of sweet potato tots and coleslaw.  With mallets in hand we took to hammering away at the blue crabs while washing everything down with a pair of Stella Artois'.  The crabs were delicious, but varied in size so I am not convinced these were all \"medium\".  The sweet  potato tots were outstanding and the coleslaw was refreshing.  Our personable server also brought us samples of 3 house-made soups: lobster bisque, Maryland crab, and clam chowder.  The lobster bisque was excellent though the other 2 were not far behind."}
{"text":"I thought I was doing this business a favor by waiting till I go to the restaurant to mention that I saw a groupon deal for a brunch. Instead of buying it through groupon and having them get a 50% cut on their end.  So I went it and mentioned it to the waiter. He told me I had to buy it first through groupon, AND I had to wait 4 hours before I can use it. I asked why , because that doesn't make any sense. And thats when he told me \"Groupon just doesn't allow us to have the vouchers used right away\" ..... okay but thats not true. And whoever in there thinks its a brilliant idea to lie to customers is an idiot. I have a business myself and am a groupon merchant. So I know exactly how it works and it does not require a 4 hour wait to use. It doesn't even take a person who is a merchant to know that. It's obviously a setup to force the customer to pay full price. Which is not really an issue for me , but they way the business is shady about it and lying to people is not a good way to make customers. I wanted to use the groupon to try the food, see how I like it (regardless of the bad reviews) and if I like it, ill come back and ill be happy to pay full price. I understand that the business is trying to make it and would prefer to have full paying customers, but heres the thing, What's better? $30 bucks plus a good tip ( especially to compensate for the groupon) or $0 ? Because thats what they got from me, just for lying. And just for that, I probably won't give them another chance. What could've been a chance to make a customer, they made it so unreasonable and now I'm on here . And i didn't even get the chance to try the food. but from the looks of the reviews, it looks like i didn't miss out. Heres a tip for the crab corner, if you just want full paying customers, then I suggest you take down the  campaign and quit bull shitting ."}
{"text":"The customer service was terrible.  They got mine and my daughter order all wrong and when I mentioned it to him he had an attitude and asked if I wanted extra fried oysters and I told him No,  I ordered shrimp then he told me since my daughter ordered fried oysters to just give her mine and he'll bring me out extra shrimp ....... WTF ????? Not to mention we waited 20min in an empty restaurant!!! 

Let me add that I still left the young man a $2.00 tip,  only bcz they're quick to say we never tip well, but if your hospitality is rude and insulting then why should ANYONE TIP WELL? 

If you work in customer service and you're having a bad day.... Stay home!!! If you are in any way prejudice,  find another line of work, bcz it's 2015 and that kind of narrow minded ignorance is no place for customer service or anywhere. 

This guy was so rude from the start for no reason.  Never again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, overpriced food that was flavorless, the server was really nice but ghe would go on bouts where he would disappear for awhile and then bombard you every 10 sec"}
{"text":"Everyone was SUPER nice, even though we came in near closing time. Food was exactly as we expected. Steamed clams and shrimp, both delicious. Definitely recommend as a casual change from \"The Strip\". Again, just want to say how nice and attentive everyone was at the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's our first time here, and by reading the reviews of others. ...we expected a totally different experience. 
I ordered the fish and shrimp with onion rings.
Well, the onion rings were golden brown and hot-very tasty.
The rest of the meal- very disappointing the shrimp over breaded and about one third the size it should have been.
The fish was cold and greasy 2 pieces about the size of two Chicken McNuggets each.
the soft shell crab platter had three very small soft shell crabs with were also served cold, soggy and very greasy not much flavor at all.
At first the service was fine because there was only 2 tables seated ,at the end of our meal the restaurant was almost completely full they only had one waitress doing work ...two other people kind of wandering around and a bus boy who was trying his best.
Needless to say we will not be back  to this establishment .
For what it's worth ..Hot and juicy has never disappointed us has always been the best place in town."}
{"text":"Crab Corner is a great find here in Spring Valley.  The food was great.  Everyone was super attentive.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great hush puppies, deep fried soft shell crab, and homemade salads (coleslaw, potato) are awesome. Love it."}
{"text":"I love the prices of the oysters.  I've been pretty disappointed with the other food with the exception of the hush puppies.  My main problem with this place is the horrendous fishy smell you have to eat in.  It smells so bad!  It was great during warming times when we could just eat outside or the bar outside but now they have it closed (we just drove by and saw this and because the smell is so offensive we are going down to Rhythm Kitchen for their happy hour oysters). It's too bad."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood and have a craving for crab and don't mind peeling and deshelling the sweet and juicy meat, then this is the place for you!

Crab Corner is a small restaurant and when we got there on a Friday night, it was already crowded and had to wait about 15-20 minutes.  There was a large party that was just being seated.  I think they accept reservations, so I would recommend making one before you go.  There was no sign up sheet, but the owners and crew knew the order and offered us seats, while we waited.

The customer service was excellent and with that alone, they would get 5 stars.  My wife said they get 10 in her book.  They were very attentive and helped us with the menu, since it was our first time there.  When the crab came, they showed us how to open the crab up and tricks to get the meat.  We already knew how to do it, but wanted to see if they had special tricks of their own.  =)  The place was busy, but it wasn't just the waiter that came by and asked us how we were doing, but practically every worker came by and talked to us.  You can tell they were genuinely good folks.

We ordered their boardwalk fries, crab cake appetizers, and 6 large male blue crabs.  The fries and the crab cakes came out first.  The boardwalk fries were tasty and splashing malt vinegar on it made it even better.  Yum.  The crab cakes were a little small, but the menu did say each were 1 oz.  Other places compensate and add other stuff like bread stuffing and other fillings, but the good thing about Crab Corner's crab cakes were that it was practically all meat.  It wasn't earth shattering tasty goodness like this one restaurant in Baltimore, but it was still good.  The sauce that came with the crab cakes was a perfect complement and was a good start for the dinner.

Then our large crabs came.  They were out of the jumbo size.  The large size was smaller than expected, but again these are blue crabs, not dungenous crabs.  The meat was very sweet, soft and moist.  The seasoning was good and I liked licking it off my fingers while eating the crab meat.  heheh.  They also had extra seasoning on the side as well.  My wife and I didn't talk for a while, since we were all focusing on the food.  haha.  But again, the waiters and owners came by regularly to check up on us.  If you have little toddlers that get restless, you might want to get a babysitter, since you can be there for a while and your hands get messy.  There were other families there with kids, but I'm glad my sister-in-law babysat our little one that night. 

I wanted to check out this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and was definitely happy with this place.  However, if you are in the mood for other shellfish and not just crab, you might want to go to other places like Hot and Juicy Crawfish, though this place offers other shellfish as well.  Note, I didn't try other shellfish like crawfish and shrimp here yet, but this is my gut feeling.  I paid the same amount in Crab Corner as in Hot and Juicy, but felt more \"stuffed\" at the latter.  However, Crab Corner definitely satisfied my crab craving and would come back here again.  I definitely want to try their other entrees and appetizers and of course, have some of the blue crab again (maybe jumbo next time)."}
{"text":"I've been here three times the first time I was there I realized it was pretty pricey but I liked it because I hadn't discovered hot and juicy which I preferred more over this place 
You can get some coupons off of LivingSocial or Groupon I remember and I definitely like the atmosphere the service and the food was good but sometimes it can get very crowded and loud

Nice find 
Great crab legs"}
{"text":"Come here for the all you can set Maryland Blue Crabs.... Very good and even though they are a little small I thought they were very tasty..."}
{"text":"We went to Crab Corner on 3/17 with friends.  My husband ordered the lobster bisque soup, awesome.  We then ordered to share the crab dip, which just came out already spread on pieces of bread, not what we expected.  I ordered the fried oysters, sweet and large, great taste.
Our friends ordered the steamed clams, whoa, salty, too much, could not dip the bread in the juice.  I ordered steamed mussels, they were so small you could miss eating one, and the liquid was too too salty. no dipping of the bread.  The crab legs were good and the wine was very good.  I do not know if we would go back or not.  The waiter was very good, but did not care about the salty clams or mussels.  Claimed it was the clams and mussels that were salty."}
{"text":"I'm married to a Maryland guy that knows his seafood and it was pretty good.  Had the steamed crabs, soft shell crab sandwich and a salad. The knock in the star is for service. It was Ok."}
{"text":"Perfect service, perfect food, perfect atmosphere. Ashley was our bartender and she was awesome!!! The Crab Benedict and Bloody Mary were, yes you guessed it...perfect! Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give more than a 2. I just was not impressed. Food was okay, service okay. The place was clean...I had heard great things and I expected more."}
{"text":"AMAZING ! this is my first time at the new location and it's just as good with a makeover. I sat in the bar area and the waiter was so on top of everything  and not to much in the way considering your a mess.  I had 5 minutes  before the happy ended and they understood and got right to the order. Love them.  I will be back ! $1 oysters and $3 male blue crabs medium. Plus a $3 jack and coke. Solo date was a success.    Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was a-OK..not bad...; We ordered take out and it was nice to have parking spaces up front for the take out orders.
Hubby ordered the sea clams and specifically asked for two sauces - the red sauce and the tartar sauce.  The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.  
I had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad.
The low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???"}
{"text":"I normally go here when I need a Maryland crab fix but I'll not come back after this experience. Walked in to place an order to-go and was not greeted or acknowledge by any worker for about 7 minutes.  Within the six minutes I grabbed a menu and stood by the podium to place in order.  I saw 3 employees during that time one which helped another person sitting down that was waiting before me.  The other two went to the podium to grab something only to walk away right after.  Another person walked in and was acknowledged immediately by a waiter.  It was only until this time the waiter said \"we will
be right with you.\"  

As for the food, I ordered a few female crabs and the crawfish special.  The crabs were excellent 4.5/5 as expected.  The crawfish was slightly bland but I guess that's how it is normally cooked with that style.  I asked if the crawfish were live but when I started eating it I found a few about less than a pound that had signs of being dead and old such as being mushy or black mush inside the crawfish with no meat.

Overall, the crab were delicious, crawfish was less than mediocre, but the service was abysmal.  Plus side is when you finally get to order they come out in 10 minutes or less."}
{"text":"Had take out. Crab cakes and brussel sprouts. Ordered a side Caesar salad. They forgot to pack the salad. Came back about a half hour for it and it was sitting out on the counter by the hostess waiting. Was told dressing on the side, but it was drenched in dressing. The crab cakes are good. Lots of large chunks of crab. Served with tartar sauce. Wish they had a spicy aioli or just something better than tartar. The brussel sprouts had great flavor and cooked just right. Would go back but just for the seafood and I'll make sure I double check before I leave if it's Togo."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Crab Corner in its new location. I really liked the old location. The new location is nice as well. The particular night we visited they were doing a Plant with buddies group. So that along with the Knights game made for a little louder than normal atmosphere. The food as always was good, however it seemed like the prices have gone up greatly in comparison to the old location. The waiter was good although he could have been more attentive to our group of 5."}
{"text":"Came back here again today after a friend invited me. It has been over a year or so since I come back. I told myself not to come here but I gave a benefit of a doubt that it might be a little better.. or a change.. We ordered 18 blue crabs, a dozen of oysters, 2 lbs of clams, 1 lb of mussels, and a bunch of other items.. the food was ok (a little disappointed since they ran out of the female blue crabs). However, towards the end, I had my last piece of clams and when I opened it up, it was all dirt and black color. I don't even know what it is. So i ask the manager, same guy unfortunately (Jeremy) and asked him what it was. Sure enough, same attitude with the response stating \"well, its probably dirt and you can get 1 or 2 bad ones in the batch.\" Really?!? That's how he address the issue to the customer?? I was like ok but it's still bad so it doesn't matter if its 1 or 2. I'm not asking for a freebie but just wanna let u know so that the next customer didn't get it. I'm giving it a 1star again because its the same guy with the same bad customer service..
 Here's the proof of the pic."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place to get crab in Vegas. Amazing service and food. The crab cakes are moist and do not need anything on them. The soft shell crabs are a must. Overall this restaurant is a place you have to go."}
{"text":"Came here couple of times. They have great happy hours and special days....Like on Wednesday during 9PM to 10PM, they have flip it or bill it (i think that's what they call it) but basically whatever you order during that hour (drinks, beer, food, etc...) you flip a coin and you call it. If you call it right, its FREE and if not, then pay your regular bill whatever it is. 

So.. lets see...

FOOD....good food, its not a fancy seafood place here. It's bar sooo yeah, seafood and beer and stuff. So don't wear your fancy shirt and pants. Food presentation is going to be basic, again it's not fancy, so don't whiny about presentation. The food here is fresh. I come here usually for happy hour because they have $4 blue crabs and $1 oyster. Its good, but the oyster are so small you need to order 2 dozen just to make you feel you ate a dozen oyster. 

PRICE....its seafood, some dish are cheap and others are little expensive just depending what type of seafood you order. 

PLACE...lots of parking, TV, chairs and tables. they have 3 side in that restaurant: one side is for the bar, other is for the restaurant and they also have outside tables. 

STAFF... some are good and some are bad. The people who are bad are usually new staff. so obviously, they're still learning. So I cant really complain. Btw, read what on their shirt says...(pretty funny)!

One bad time... i had was when i order blue crab cake entree, and they had a little side salad. in that salad....a big huge dead moth....they gave me like 10% or 25 % off for that meal. But i still afraid to finish the remainder of the food, so i barely ate half of the meal. so i felt it's not fair just getting 10 or 25 % off for a meal i barely ate half of."}
{"text":"Crab Corner is hands down some of the best seafood in town.  My fianc√© is from Maryland and is SUPER picky about seafood and absolutely loves it here. Yes it's expensive, but it's fresh seafood that's worth the money!
Their crab cakes are amazing, and true to Maryland form.  The owners are often behind the bar, which is great, it shows they take pride in their restaurants.  Don't forget to get a Berger cookie!!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Eastside location before and this southwest location is just as Amazing, Fun and DELICIOUS.  I recommend the Crabby Bloody Mary (the BEST Bloody Mary in town), the Bacon Wrapped Scallops (an amazing surprise wrapped in bacon...can't beat that) and the Sample Platter...those are my favorite!!!  The ambiance just adds to everything.  Monday Night Football watching just found a new home.  A great hangout with games, yumminess and a fun environment!  Definitely my GO TO place in Vegas ANY DAY, ANY TIME!"}
{"text":"This review is not meant to pan Crab Corner, but help it a bit. The food is good for the Eastern Ave. location that is more reminiscent of Eastern Ave. in Essex, but with the new location that is a bit more like Cockeysville or Reisterstown. A better location with hopefully better food. This review is also the culmination of about 10 visits over a few months. 

First of all the crabs are good. It's great to have a bit of home in Vegas but your staple can't carry the entire business. Let's look at some of the other food. The crab dip is horrendous in style and presentation. It's small French bread slices with the crab dip on the toasted bread. It needs to be a hot creamy bowl that the warm French bread is dipped into presented on a seperate basket on the side...that's how it's been every time I've ordered it in Bal'mer. Every time I order it I feel a bit cheated. 

I don't always have time to order the crabs and when taking a client there for lunch have to order off the limited menu. I end up with the shrimp salad sandwich because it's quick and easy. However, every time I order it's described as 'large spiced shrimp' and I always get it and feel cheated yet again. They are quite small and not up to normal Baltimore restaurant size (or at least what I'm use to from Little Lou's). They could be a bit bigger and offer a choice of buns like a roll since small shrimp are hard to eat on a sandwich roll in an earth-like gravity. 

The steamer sampler is good, however the crabs are female (I NEVER eat females as they decrease the population) and feel it should be mentioned on the menu before ordering. I would like to see a choice of sauces like Bertha's. You can be Bal'mer style without directly copying. 

OK, with the menu choices are kinda lax. I would like to see burgers and local favorites like crab burger or hot & Bleu burger.

I know you can't get Boh, but would like to see more local Beers like Dogfish Head IPA. It's a crab staple in MD and readily available here. 

I hope to see Crab Corner improve as it grows."}
{"text":"Don't let this little hole in the wall fool you. The food is great. Y

I got the crab legs, which were cooked perfectly. I also tried some of the clams, which again were excellent. I live in Colorado so it's hard to get seafood at all. I would definitely come back here if I'm in Vegas again. 

The atmosphere is very casual. It looks kind of like a fast food deli. Definitely worth the money for fresh seafood in the desert though."}
{"text":"Fun and messy. 
Eat from the paper table cover. 
Service is excellent. 
Portions are generous. 
Clams and mussels are great!
Hammer crack your own crab. 
Enjoyed the crab dip on bread and crab cakes were to die for. 
Fun food with a Cajun touch. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"love the crab here.  Fairly priced and cheap on Tuesdays and Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Shared the mini crab cakes, soft shell crab sandwich, and catfish entree with potato salad and green beans.  It was all delicious!  The potato salad had great flavor with the celery and onions.  The catfish had the perfect crunch. My favorite was the mini crab cakes.  Would like to try bigger ones next time. It was pretty steady for a Thurday afternoon and Jared did a great job!  He brewed us fresh coffee that we needed for our afternoon pick me up.  Prices are reasonable.  If I lived closer I would probably visit more often.  Open a location in Henderson!  My sister and I agreed that the only thing that could have made it better was if there was mac and cheese, especially a lobster mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this place. To begin with, my margarita was made with only tequila and agave nectar and did not taste very great. 

We waited for 30 minutes to get a drink order. We never got the crayons I requested for my kiddos to entertain them while we waiting so long. 

The waiters take their orders from their iPhones which seem a little unprofessional. My husband requested a dozen crabs to share with my son and the waiter recommended only getting one crab per person. We waited an hour to receive our food. I ordered two appetizers and I was pleased with my food but my husband and my son were starving after finishing their one crab. We had to go get something to eat afterward. 

Needless to say we were very disappointed with our visit and will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Vegas for the 1st time and while we were there we decided 2 try this place because we love seafood so much and wow we were pleasantly surprised with the Crab cakes! It brought me back to the Crabs in Maryland that I love so much because they are the best by far. The staff was really accommodating and the atmosphere was relaxing. I enjoyed myself and will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with terrible wait times. Nothing on the waiter though he was great. Only he can do so much with cashiering, bussing, taking and delivering orders. The place was pack full with said waiter, took almost 10 minutes to order and another 5 for drinks. Didn't order any appetizers straight for entree. Soft shell crab taste like most AYCE all you can eat and the fries are nothing special. I would go back if I had another groupon otherwise...eh."}
{"text":"We had a casual lunch at the Crab Corner yesterday.  Service was friendly, the menu offered several varieties of fish and seafood.  It was National Margarita Day so of course, we had a couple.  The drinks hit the spot, lunch was served in a timely manner. I had the fish fry which included 4 fillets of cod and my companion had the Shrimp Ceasar Salad. Both were delicious. We can't wait to go back and try their beautiful outside dining area."}
{"text":"try the fried calamari, soft shell crab, and crab cake, all are good, nothing spectacular, price is on the high side, service is on par"}
{"text":"To be fair I am originally from Maryland so my standards for a place that claims to have Maryland style seafood might be high but it also meant I was super stoked to try this place out. We had a group on deal that was purchased for $15 for 25$ worth of food. Upon arrival we were seated by a hostess who took our drink orders. The server \"Richard\" came up to take our order with a smile but using his iphone. I was having dinner with my Mother and two children aged 7 and 4 . Since  the restaurant only has two items on their kids menu - Fried Shrimp or Chicken strips I was forced to get my 7 year old a adult entree of spice and peel  shrimp which turned out to be my favorite thing in the whole place. My Mother got a order of Boardwalk fries and the Annapolis Crab Dip (Sliced toasted baguette covered with rich cream cheese & crab meat) yes it was a appetizer but she ordered it as her entree and they brought it out FIRST which is a personal pet peeve of mine but hey at least they didn't let it get cold right?  The dip appeared to have tons of crab in it but it was majorly lacking flavor and the Baguettes were very chewy and not anything I would order again especially for the price . We were pleased it didn't have a artificial crab flavor. Since our server was no where to be found we weren't able to locate the Old Bay till the end our meal but it helped with the flavor a bit. I ordered the Pick 2 Combo Entree  which they have a decent number of options to pick from I went with Fried Oysters (My personal Fav anywhere that serves them) and Fried Clams which comes with two sides (I went with hush puppies and potato salad) for 12.99. I thought it was a pretty good deal $ wise. My Oysters were really good but my clams were way over cooked same with the hush puppies. When the host lady brought my food I didn't notice until I went to ask for Tartar sauce that my potato salad was missing and this is why my rating ended up being a 2 instead of a  3. I advised her that my potato salad must of been forgotten and that we were still waiting on the fries instead of a let me check on where those are or a sorry she said and I quote \" No Maam it just wasn't ready yet so it didn't get brought out\"  so to me that was just really rude because I have been many places and they do not prepare potato salad made to order it's essentially just a scoop which I did eventually get . She didn't bring my tartar sauce and when I finally flagged down our server \"Richard\" he did say sorry and that he would get my potato salad and check on my Moms fries. Guess what? he brought my potato salad but didn't bring my tartar sauce which was what I wanted all along so by the time I was able to eat my yummy oysters they were cold and I was already annoyed. The boardwalk fries did finally come out once we were almost done with our whole meal but Richard was kind enough to try to rectify my upset by comping us for the fries which turned out to be somewhat of a saving grace but I still wouldn't go back to this place again. The service needs improvement and for the price the food just doesn't outweigh the slow turnover and mediocre job on the items. The peel and eat shrimp really was delicious though and if you are dying for a place where you can pick your own crab and enjoy some spicy shrimp its worth checking out but I can't say I will be back."}
{"text":"The menu says lobster bisque has more meat than traditional bisque,  but it has zero meat.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Had the fried shrimp during my last visit.  Another win for Crab Corner.  The breading is not overly thick and the shrimp were not enormous, but not small either.  The cocktail sauce had a fair amount of horseradish, something a lot of places skimp on.  I will order this again."}
{"text":"Had a great time with Ashley the most fab bartender at Crab Corner! She made my Alaskan King Crab Legs dream come true! Too awesome! Must try!! Oysters rocked too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy this place.  It is always fun to go and get dirty.  I will give this place 5 stars because they have great specials if you go at the right time, service is great, food is great, and just an overall great experience.

You must have the crab cakes at this place, really some of the best."}
{"text":"Thanks, but no thanks.

I work in the plaza that Crab Corner is in and have been warned many times not to dine there.  Well, guess what? I went anyways.....and I was wrong.

We went on a Friday night and the place was absolutely amazing empty.  Despite the few people in the restaurant, service was slow and inattentive. We had a really hard time getting the server's attention.

My real issue is with the food. We started a dozen oysters, which did not taste fresh at all.  We then ordered their signature blue crap.  They offer 5 different sizes, from regular with jumbo.  Go big or go home right? We opted to for for jumbo crabs, which were 3X the price of regular crabs.  Well, we went big and had to go home anyways. The jumbo crabs were smaller than the size of my hands. There were about 3-4 bites of meat inside.  The legs were so skinny that they were practically empty. 

After spending $70 for two people, we were still hungry. We ended up going to another restaurant for more food."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Crab Corner during my visit in early February and enjoyed our visit. The service was great from the moment we walked in to the ending of our meal. We visited the week before Valentine's day and they had the special menu for 2. Our special menu for 2 choices were the appetizer trio which came with crab cake, bacon wrapped scallops, & bread with crab dip and for our entr√©e we got the lobster and snow crab legs. The entr√©e came with choices of 2 sides, we got 2 rice, garlic beans, and cole slaw. A bottle of red wine and for dessert we got the caramel cheesecake with ice cream. My other half and I enjoyed our meal. Everything was delicious and by the time we got to dessert we were so stuffed that we only finished the ice cream and I had to take the cheesecake with me to the hotel. I am not sure if  the special menu is just for Valentine's day but this is a great deal. Reading the latest Yelp reviews, I am not sure what happened, but we had a great experience. I can't wait to be back again @ Crab Corner."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm mmm. Had been craving some crab and oysters after being pregnant for so long and was delighted to find this business on yelp. Laid back place that I can dress casual and eat good! We were sat right away and attended to quickly. Our waiter Jeremy was outstanding. He answered my questions about the different crab they had as there were many options and gave his opinion on what was good. 

I ordered the oysters and calamari first. The oysters are $1 during happy hour 2-6 during the week and on Sunday's. I ordered 8 to start. I was really happy to see they were on the small side as I hate large chunky oysters. The flavor was so good I slurped them down In a couple minutes and ordered a dozen more to enjoy. The Calamari was some of the best I have had. Really crunchy.. Mmm. We ordered a lobster, king crab, fries and co slaw . Everything was so freaking good. It was the best meal I have had all year! Jeremy was nice enough to bring us out some blue crab to try as there was a mistake In the kitchen. We were having trouble getting the meat out so he showed us the expert way to open it. Way too much work for me but I appreciated him letting having us experience it. We topped off the meal with some rich chocolate cake. I think it was the 1st time my husband and I have cleared the table in a long time, licking our fingers on the way out. 

You will definitely see me back here and with friends!"}
{"text":"* Blue Crab - First timers - Owner sat down to give us a lesson in eating blue crab (for all you non-Marylanders or blue crab fans, it is because you eat most of the meat from the body, not the legs/claws, which is what I am used to)....after the quick lesson, we felt more comfortable eating them (nice touch in customer service)!!  The meat was VERY sweet and delicious!!!!  Glad we tried them!!  
* Snow crab - seriously, this is the BEST snow crab that I have EVER had....Cooked perfectly and so sweet...you don't even need the butter to dip!!!  If you are a foodie, PLEASE don't waste your time at the local buffets and AYCE places ....this is seriously the BEST in town!!!  I am craving it as I write this!!!!   I think I will see you tonight Crab Corner ;-) 
* Crab cakes - Not a lot of filling, chunks of Crab and very flavorful!!
* The crab soup - good
* Hushpuppies - YUM.....ask for some tartar sauce for dipping ;-)
* Boardwalk Fries - freshly cut....ask for them extra crispy!!!  

This place really does get it right! It is super casual (because eating crab can be a messy job), the restaurant is relatively small (cozy and friendly) and the customer service is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"As a sad Marylander that gets disappointed every time I order any thing crab related out here where I live in Southern California, I was super happy to learn that I needed to head to Vegas this weekend for an event and would have some time to eat at Crab Corner. 

It was JUST like being at home! The only thing missing was the river side picnic tables and the humidity. This place gets it right! The hush puppies were delish, the peel and eat shrimp were served hot just like they should be and the dozen crabs were a god send! 
I also sampled the Maryland Crab Vegetable soup and was pleased. It could be made a bit better by adding just a little more spice to it, but otherwise it was great.

To all east coasters that are transplanted anywhere within a few hours drive of Vegas this is a must go! The location is miles away from the strip, and easy to find. 

My only issue is the lack of any lacrosse sticks hanging on the walls and no Naval Academy Blue and Gold anywhere. Perhaps this Annapolis girl should send some gifts their way.

The prices are reasonable and about the same as to what I am used to spending on crabs even at home in Maryland. I know some reviewers mentioned price but I would have paid triple what they charged and still been happy!

By the way the owners are super nice and friendly and it was fun to hear an authentic Maryland accent from someone that was not a character on The Wire or a member of my family!

I will be back! Next time I'm trying some crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place but am thoroughly disappointed.  Nothing was good about this place.  

I order a cup of the Maryland soup,I think it was, and it tasted like salt water.   I also order the king crab legs and it was overcooked and felt like plastic.  I wasn't even given any utensils, butter or lemon!!! What kind of place doesn't serve butter and lemon with their crab?  You would think $30 bucks for 4 crab legs would be a little bit more presentable, not just given to you in a plastic basket.

The guy who took our order, did it over an iPhone and seemed like this was the first time he's ever took an order in his life.  Overall, I'm sorry to say but this place is horrible.  The check was over $100, for 4 people and nothing was even half way decent for the price.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"What's not to love?  Amazing fresh crab, ridiculous drink specials, efficient/fun layout, and some of the most hospitable servers and bartenders in LV.  Crab Corner SW hits on all elements.  Getting crabs in Vegas has never been so satisfying!"}
{"text":"So the atmosphere is casual if not hole in the wall. I mean wine is served in little bottles with plastic wine glasses.  But the food is great! Kyle was our waiter and he was perfect!  Then one of the owners Mark came by and was very friendly and nice.  Food was fantastic!  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"I am leaving this review because I can and want to.  Happy happy joy joy.  Oh la de dah!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Great service. The prices are reasonable. I had the lobster roll. Best one I  ever had. The boys had both of the Steamer Samplers. Lots of food. We brought one of our grandchildren who never ate seafood before. She tried everything & loved it. 
We shall return!"}
{"text":"Started going here since the day they opened. Owners are brothers and really knowledgable about thier product and food. Crab is flown in from their own fishing company if I remember right.  Thier seafood is fresh and tasty. Eat setup is fun. Eat everything right on the table, covered with a large paper. It's not the best looking spot inside, but it gives you that by the bay kind vibe, instead of boats, there's the automobiles on eastern haha.  Thier dungeness is seasonal, so if your coming for that, call first. They present thier dungeness and blue crab unseasoned, but flavorful, if that makes sence. Deffinately the go to spot if your in the central area for that quick seafood fix. They do have to go too, so if your not in the mood for a sit in, call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"Soon as I walked in I felt like I was in a New Orleans seafood joint. Their playing old-school hits. The staff is awesome. I ordered six fresh shucked oyster's and they were amazing. Fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce and lemon, perfect.  Met the owner, one of the owners, Mark. My server was a really great guy named Kyle. I'll definitely be back, it was like being in New Orleans. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Ah yes. I'm sensing a pattern here, another strip mall, unassuming corner spot. It's a beer guzzling, picnic table, football loving locale the Baltimore Raven's fans call home.  The staff wears a funny tshirt that says \"I got crabs in Vegas\" that I believe is for sale too!  What an amazing spot! NO Sunday best's so get ready to get messy. The blue crab's are flown in daily. They are known for their crabcakes and you can also have live lobster, crawfish and shrimp from Louisiana & the gulf coast.    

The best part of the menu is ordering by the dozen. Depending on the size of the crab is the price per dozen. They're brought to you in a bucket, steamed deliciouness that's worth all the effort.  And then you crack away. They provide you will a mini mallet, and crab cracker. Have fun and don't rush. The best of the crab is only enjoyed with patience.

Bring the family because this is seafood eating at it's funnest!!  I can tell you from first hand experience on going crabbing in Savannah that anymore fresh and you'd be catching the crab yourself."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here got 2 of the Pound blue crab legs and asked to bring cocktail sauce. They came no cocktail sauce the crab legs are soooooo tiny and I'm mad. I will think twice before ordering from them."}
{"text":"I really believe that the positive reviews are from friends and family members. I am so disappointed in crab corner. I have been coming here since the place first opened to eat Maryland  blue crab. I'm originally from Maryland and I consider myself a professional crab eater. In other words ....I love crabs, I eat them all year around, I can crack them with my hands no utensils needed and I can eat dozens by myself.

Here are the reasons why I will never EVER never go back. ....1. The guy /cashier is soooo  soooo  soooooo rude and unprofessional. 2. The guy attempted to pick  an argument with me before the crabs were even sold. 3. The guy knew the crabs were bad when he sold them but chose to sale them anyway...integrity. 4. He tried to lie about the crabs being from Maryland. . . The crabs are from Texas. Texas?? Why advertise Maryland blue crab when they arent.  5. The meat in the crabs were mushy and he had to crack one just to see for himself. As if I was lying 6. Crabs should not be full of water..they know that but  they sell them to people anyway.   7. I ordered a dozen medium male and 2 reg females. The guy acted like he forgot I ordered to female crabs. When I turned all of them over and showed him all males he acted like he was shocked .. he didn't realize he was messing with a pro . 8. The guy tried to make me pay for the crabs even though he knew they weren't any good. 9. Because i wasnt in the mood to argue...We agreed that I would pay for 3 and my friend would pay for 3...although  ....   we ate NONE. Each one we cracked was full of water and one look or feel of the very little (light weight)...real crab eaters know what I mean when I say light weight) meat ..u can tell the meat was mushy.. 10. Even after we paid for the food we didn't eat the guy tried once again to pick an argument by making condescending statements. Once again I will NEVER ever NEVER GO BACK!!! OH they get 1 star for French fries.. my friend said they were great. DO NOT BUY TEXAS..lol CRABS from this place."}
{"text":"Being from Maryland, i know good seafood md style....  The soft shell crab,, was a 7,, not very big, they were obviously frozen which i can understand...  The crab cake was a 7,,, a little too much filler for my tastes, but better than the so called MD crab cakes on some the menu's around town...  The crab soup,, a 5, it was ehhhhh... It would be unfair to compare this restauant to the crab places in China Town... This is done MD style,, not Asian... Crabs this way is done better... Boiling the takes kills the natural sweetness of the crab, or putting them in a wok and frying them in oil... BLAH... not my thing,, but to each its own...  I like this place and the people that own it... They are Orioles and Ravens fans...  Its not as good as back home but for out here,, its really good...."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Vegas, I ate here twice. Yes, this place is awesome. I wish I could go back. I came on a Tuesday and it was $2 for a medium Maryland blue crab. The guy that worked there, told me that on Thursdays it was $3 for a large Maryland blue crab. I couldn't pass up that deal. You need to get here early. Once they sell out of the crabs, that's it. You're either going to have to order another size or wait for another day. Sometimes, they don't get the crabs in, so the guy told me to call first. 

Their crabs are flown in fresh. It was so fresh, sweet, and yummy. On Tuesday, I ordered four. On Thursday, I ordered three. They were broiled with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled on the shell. They were all delicious. I also had the crab cakes. They're the best crab cakes ever. Every bite of the crab cake had chunks of meat and very little filling. It was seasoned to bring out the freshness of the crab. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. It was a huge portion and fried perfectly.

My husband doesn't like seafood so he ordered the grilled cheese sandwich that came with chips. He said the sandwich was good and stuffed with cheese. He didn't finish the chips. It might have needed more salt or seasoning. He also got the mozzarella sticks for his appetizer and polished those off. They were really good with the marinara dip.

The guys working there were really friendly. We talked story and about football. We needed directions to Trader Joe's and they were more than happy to help. One of the guys even helped me with my fantasy football pick.

I told the guy that they needed to open up a spot on Oahu. He smiled and said that the prices weren't going to be the same, shipping charges to Hawaii are horrendous. It's the story of my life. If I lived in Vegas, I would be here every Tuesday and Thursday. I want to fly back just for this. It was the best meal that I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I realllyyyyyy wanted to like this place. I was killing time waiting to go somewhere and hadn't had dinner yet. Based on a previous review I decided to stop in at the crab corner and order what had been highly rated in a previous review, Clam strips, hush puppies and catfish with sweet potato fries. When my plate came out it looked pleasantly full- crispy burnished brown, with a fresh homemade-looking cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Sadly, the flavor did not live up to the first impression looks. The clams had a crisp exterior which yeilded an unpleasantly mushy and dare I say slimy? Interior. Some of the crispy bits had clam, some were more clam- flavored batter, I'd say half the total order. I'm completely perplexed as to how the previous reviewer had \"ordered another of clam strips as they were the best he'd ever had\". The catfish still had that silver skin on underneath the batter and tasted pretty muddy. I never understood people complaining about \"catfish tasting dirty\" till now. Brrrr. The pieces were small and pretty thin, too (anyone looking for amazing crispy fresh catfish, try Cravin' Cajun on Jones which will still be my go-to). The sweet potato fries were greasy and limp within 5 minutes of their arrival. I ate 3 hush puppies which seemed to be the only rightly flavorful and \"decent\" part of the plate. 

To top it all off.. I ordered a fountain drink (root beer) and the first thing I noticed upon a sip was the strong tap water aftertaste. What the heck!!!

The only thing I think worth stars in this whole meal was the service, with only 2 young guys manning the front and I swear they checked on me at least twice through my meal (both of them). How this place earned a 2012 Review Journal \"Best Of\" completely escapes me!!! Now to upload the pics I took. Sigh."}
{"text":"Ate there, not going back.  Place was not too busy.  My colleague ordered jumbo shrimp with a cup of soup and I ordered 1/2 lb of shrimp with a side salad.  Also ordered crab cakes as an appetizer.  After the order was put in, two soups arrive.  One soup went back and a salad came out with the wrong dressing.   When we were eating, another soup and salad arrived, wtf! The crab cakes never arrived.  My colleague's shrimp arrived, but not mine after quite some time.  Then when mine arrived, it was not 1/2 lb.  My colleague did not check the bill and was charged for shrimp that was never fully delivered and for crab cakes.  Right before we left, a server stopped by with more shrimp even though we never ordered it.  They just opened, but, man...not good at all.  Look at your bill before you leave."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check this place out. Given the reviews, pictures, and here say on Facebook I figured this would be a good experience. 

We came around 2, so just when happy hour was starting. And to my surprise it wasn't busy. In fact at one point during our meal we were the only ones in there. Not that that is a bad thing, I like the quietness. It just rarely happens. The service was simple. Take your order, deliver your food, drop off the check and good bye. Nothing too special to write home about. 

Anyways, the ambiance is open and spread out, probably seemed more so since it was so slow. the menu is large with additional flip menus on the table. For happy hour we got a doze of the fresh half shell oysters for $1 each. They were delicious, served with lemon, horseradish and Marinara. 

Then, for our main lunch I got the crab cake sandwich which was so delicious it was one of those melt in your mouth experiences. It had amazing flavor and just the right amount of density to keep its form and the perfect crunch with crisp lettuce and tomato. It was also served with their home made potato chips. My friend got the fried oyster Po' boy. I can tell you he enjoyed it because he devoured it quickly! But really, he said it was really good! 

We will be back to try something else, and of course you can find us there around happy hour! The fresh oysters alone are worth a try here!"}
{"text":"Before heading to Las Vegas on vacation, I had purchased a Groupon for $25 worth of food for two people at Crab Corner. I don't recall how much I had paid for the Groupon back then. 

I waited for my friend in to arrive in Vegas (I was here for a few days before she joined me). We headed over to Crab Corner for lunch. I drove us there. I didn't have any problems parking my rental car.

This place has a casual vibe to it. It's essentially a bar with poker video slot machines. 

I had a lapse on this trip. I am normally pretty good at taking photos of what I have eaten. I guess that my friend was a distraction. All I found in my photos was a single photo of the view from where I was sitting. Luckily, I do remember what we had eaten.

My friend doesn't eat pork, so going to a seafood place was perfect. We ordered crab cakes, calamari, soft shell crab, and fried mozzarella sticks.

I loved the crab cakes the best. They were a decent size and tasted yummy. The calamari was okay. It was slightly on the oily size. The soft shell crab was yummy, too. I am not a big fan of mozzarella sticks to begin with. I found them to be okay. I only had a couple of them.

I also ordered a Diet Pepsi to wash everything down. I got a refill, which was nice.

Our server was friendly and helpful. I have no complaints about service.

This place offers good seafood. It's not the best that I have ever had. However, if you are in Vegas and are craving seafood in a casual setting, come here.

{"text":"Lunch with the kids from Hawaii food was dry everyone ordered something different everything was awful with the exception of crab cake can't really mess up a crab cake it was 17 dollars for one small crab cake I can make about 15 crab cakes same size for the same price and my recipe is much better 2 stars for service the server was very nice and on point"}
{"text":"I eat the oysters and mussels... oysters where a little small but still good Sunday they have the special going on for the oysters 1 dollar each. Mussels where good service was good. The bread was good to got to come back again for this place. Hopefully they expand living in the north ita a little drive but we'll worth the food."}
{"text":"You can't even get fresher crabs from a Fremont St. hooker. The sweetest crab I have EVER had. This place is super casual, service is exceptionally personable and friendly. Wear casual clothes, cause you'll be wearing bits of crab and juice on your way out. This is not your lazy man Alaskan king crab, but they are the king of crabs from a sweetness standpoint. Be ready to work for your meal and even though it's hammer time, you CAN touch this. Whack those crabs, take your time, enjoy friends. Don't be shy, look, search, and devour each sweet tender mini, meaty, morsel you can find. The crab cakes, also the best I have ever had. Sure they are small (half dollar size), but I suspect it is labor intensive getting enough of the Maryland crab picked to make the cakes, lots of meat, little filler, devine flavor. Boardwalk fries are made from fresh spuds, and are yummy too. If your feeling crabby, this place will put you in a good mood."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came here from a groupon. It was ok. I would probably come back (when I could afford it again lol). I feel like they have some improving to do, but definitely have potential."}
{"text":"First they auto grat for 18% with a party of 5, 2 being children. They service was worth nothing. Would have totally given more but your service needs improvement and let me decide what your hospitality is worth."}
{"text":"Never had blue crabs before...

Read the reviews, and decided this would be a good place to try them out!

$3 Thursdays....the crabs as well as all the beers they sell for $3.  Can't go wrong price wise!  So how does the food fare?

The crabs were very good.  A bit of work to get to the goods, but worth it IMO.  I tried the brains/stomach, and it didn't do anything for me....gave them to my friend.  But I did enjoy the leg joints and claw meat.  And for $3 each, solid choice!

Also, the jumbo shrimp/prawns (head on) are very very good!  First of all, their \"pound\" seems a lot more generous than other quick seafood places I have tried.  Obviously it should be the same, but maybe it is because they are larger and you get more meat than shells.  The seasoning is the winner here...very very good and not super salty and overly done like some places in comparison!  You have to try them!  

The crab dip and crab cakes were also good, but I felt like they were a little spendy for what I got.  Although they were good, I will probably put that money towards more shrimp and blue crabs truthfully.

Tip, the blue crabs are cooked to order, so if you plan on ordering a few at a time, plan it out so you aren't sitting without in between sessions.  I think they took appx 15min between orders, so plan accordingly!

This will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"To start off, we were told they didn't have any blue crabs due to the cold weather back east. Bummer, but OK, that happens, we'll eat something else, although we had come in specifically for the blue crabs. Then the water tasted bad and was basically undrinkable, despite being told it's triple filtered. Bleh. Then my order of 4 mini crab cakes were extremely small....and deep fried. My fault for not asking if they were deep fried or pan-fried, which is my preferred method and the way most strip restaurants I frequent prepare it. So since I was pretty hungry, I also ordered the lobster bisque, which came out quickly and was piping hot. The first spoonful were quite good, with the deep and distinct flavor of sherry. But by the end of the bowl and with the cooling of temperature, it no longer was as tasty. None of this was the fault of our waiter who was quite informative and on point with his service. A friend who has been there many times and tried a number of different things on the menu said she only likes the blue crabs. So now I know, call ahead next time and just come for the blue crabs."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after reading good things about their happy hour. Oysters on the half shell for $1/each, mozzerella sticks for $5, calamari fries for $6, $3 domestic draft beers and well drinks, $2 off wine and $1 off other beers. Good deals in general. We also tried the po boy fried shrimp sandwich and the soft shell crab sandwich - both came with house made chips and were generous portions. The service was very good and they had a pretty high tech setup where the servers put your order into an app on their phone to order it immediately from the kitchen. I like the relaxed atmosphere and Maryland theme with a beach vibe - even smells like you're near the sea!"}

Wow, wow, wow and wow!!!!"}

The Sandwich was okay. They said it was 95% crab, but for some reason it didn't taste right. Seemed under seasoned and very fishy taste. I've ate crab cakes at many establishments and Crab Shack isn't the best I've had. The fries were a little overdone but still good.

Overall, I give this place 4 stars. The crab cakes weren't that bad and people really seemed to enjoy the blue crabs (their speciality). I probably won't order the crab cakes again but it's worth another visit to try the actual blue crabs."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! You get what you pay for....even more so if you hit up their happy hour. Our server AJ was very attentive and helpful when it came to ordering our meal. The rest of the staff were very friendly as well. Definitely recommend this place. We'll be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I am not 100% qualified to write this review, so let me start with my disclaimers: I am not a crab picker. I am not a seafood lover. However, I am married to one, so my thoughts are based partially on his reaction to his meal, my personal meal and a recitation of the facts.

Facts can be important, especially in the seafood business where product quality is of particular importance, so let's start there. Crab Corner is owned by two brothers who previous to the restaurant only owned a seafood wholesaler specializing primarily in... you guessed it, crabs! They supply a good deal of Spring Mountain Road grocery stores with their live crabs, and now, they are running their wholesale business from this location. So, I'd say the product is as fresh as can be found! They carry Maryland crabs when they are in season, but when they are not, they come from elsewhere. Right now, they are serving up Texas crabs.

As for the crabs, they are sold based on the number you want of a particular size: 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the biggest crab. They bring 'em out on tray, and then slide them onto your plastic covered table for your crackin' pleasure. Each crab is steamed and covered with J.O. Spice, which is apparently THE spice for Maryland crabs. My hub is still talking about the #1 crab, and we ate this meal a couple of days ago. He approved of both the meat quality and the value.  

I had a crab cake platter: one crab cake, two sides for $15.95. I think this is a little expensive, but of course, I am not an expert on crab pricing! As for the crab cake, if you appreciate crab more than cake, I think you'll approve as it definitely has a strong crab flavor. Although the menu said jumbo lump blue crab meat, the meat wasn't particularly lumpy. Personally, I think I like a little lumpier crab cake.

For sides, we sampled the onion rings, sweet potato tots and potato salad. Onion rings were good, but probably not hand-battered. What's not to love about sweet potato tots? And, I think the potato salad is a real contender! I bet it's based on somebody's mama's recipe, as it tasted like it were made with love. Lots of egg. The only thing I might add is some sweet pickles and a dash of mustard, but then again, who am I to question Mom? 

Lastly, the service is great. Here is another family owned business that deserves some love. These brothers are passionate about their product and their home! You can be sure they will be showing all the Ravens' games, and don't worry, their liquor license is coming soon.  

If you are a crab lover who loves to pick, this should be on your list to try."}
{"text":"Delicious! Based on reviews checked it out and happened to be $2 crabs Tuesday and $2 beers happy hour! Had oysters in the half shell, super fresh. Blue crab was just as good as in Maryland and service was quick and friendly. I would be a regular for sure if I lived here!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Amazing food and awesome, friendly service. My lady and I have never had a bad experience here. I recommend this place to everyone! Sam is our favorite!"}
{"text":"What a horrible dive! 
The food was greasy, the restaurant dirty and the staff doesn't wash their hands after using the toilet! Saw it firsthand. I called the restaurant a day later to talk with the manager and I was told he was in a meeting but would call me back.
Nope, never happened! I guess watching your business being run into the ground by filthy, incompetent employees is your thing?"}
{"text":"last night at this particular site from now on they'll only have the one on Rainbow. Shared the steamer sampler with my husband could have had another person to share it was so large. Wonderful crab cakes, maybe best ever. Calamari were crispy and fresh and the remoulade sauce was great, not so great green beans kind of taste frozen but everything else top notch"}
{"text":"I try and make it out to Crab Corner at least once a week. I love my Soft Shell Crab Platter, and Boardwalk Fries. Always get some Peel Shrimp and a fresh Shock Top! The location is very nice and in a nicer part of Vegas (Southwest). The Tanked fish tank is pretty cool as well. Keep up the good work Crab Corner!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Crab Corner on Friday for a late lunch.  I wanted to try something I'd never had before, and I had just been reading up on Crab Corner over on Rainbow.  

The location was clean, and the guys working were pleasant.

Now for the fun!

Maryland Crab Soup:  I was SO surprised to find a half of a crab in my soup!  In addition to just the shredded crab meat, they put a half a blue crab in it!  It was delicious, although being served a soup in a styrophoam bowl was a little...interesting.  Not what I expected.

We did the \"Pick two combo Entree\" and ordered:

Sea Clams: Breaded well and delicious.  
Catfish nuggets: OMG so tasty!  
Hushpuppies:  So good, they didn't need any sauce. 

The coctail sauces and tartar sauce they served with the dish was really good too.

We also did a pound of the Garlic Hard Shell Blue crab halves.
I'd never had blue crab, and I'm usually not a fan of the claw meat.  (I know, I'm weird...)
THIS was delicious.  The claw meat was awesome, and the crab was easy to \"pick\" apart.

All in all, I enjoyed the food a lot.  I plan to try out the Rainbow location as well, and next time I'm trying the crab cakes.  :D"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Crab Corner location, and enjoyed the food a lot.

This past Friday night was the fist night of Karate Karaoke at Crab Corner, so I was SUPER excited to come out.  I used to go to 3 Tomatoes all the time on the weekends, so it was exciting to be back.

The exterior hasn't changed at all.  The interior really hasn't either, except now they have a huge tank with live blue crab, and they've painted a little...

Now, onto the food.

Ever since my last experience at Crab Corner, I've wanted to try the crab cakes.  My fella isn't big on crab cakes, but agreed to get the appetizer (4 minis) to try.  

When they came out, I was concerned.  They are TINY...and really expensive.  
But after one bite, let me tell you, they were 100% worth the money.
There is SO MUCH CRAB MEAT IN THESE TINY BITES OF AWESOME!  This is going to be a regular item for me, I can tell.  SO delicious. 

We also had the cod, and the clams with hush puppies and fries:  Everything was delicious!  

Drinks were pretty decent...they had a $3 mystery shot, and $3 well whiskey....PBR was $4 at the beginning of the night, but I think it went down to $3 after karaoke started. 

Service was pretty good.  The bartender seemed a little abrasive at the beginning of the night, but she warmed up to us, and ended up being pretty darned cool.  

Karaoke was incredible, as usual.  The host was fun, and it was great to be singing on the patio again!

I can't wait to come back again.  Karaoke was shut down early this week, but from what I understand its supposed to be 10-2 this Friday night."}
{"text":"I was very excited when Lisa L. chose this as the location for our double date on Saturday. I have had it book marked for nearly a year now, so I was thrilled to have an excuse to try it with friends! I can honestly say it lived up to my expectations in every way - if you are a blue crab lover, you must try it!

My husband's family has a house on the water near Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. My husband grew up eating crabs from Maryland, and I got to experience to go crabbing with their property last summer. Watching the little crabs squirm around while being steamed to death isn't really a fond memory, but the taste of those fresh crabs is something I will never forget!!

Eating at Crab Corner really replicated the Maryland crab-eating experience for me. The crabs were very fresh, and they were prepared the same way as they are in Maryland. I really love that they used an Old-Bay-like seasoning, and didn't go the douse everything in freaking HEAT route that way too many places seem to go. I love tasting the seafood so it kills me when places like Hot and Juicy ruin a perfectly good crustacean with mouth burning spice! The other awesome thing? When you leave here your clothes, hair, and skin won't REEK of garlic for days! I didn't need to take a bath after eating here, so that really rocked! 

The special price of $35 for a dozen was more than fair, and the beer prices were reasonable as well. There were several enticing sides priced at $1.95 as well! MMMM sweet potato tots....

Whether you are from the East Coast or just a fan of all things crab, don't screw up like I did and wait a year to try this place! I will definitely be back now that I know how fabulous this place is!"}
{"text":"The Spiced Peel & Eat Shrimp was good and flavorful, however, the environment and service weren't great at all."}
{"text":"Over priced and disappointing. I've had better fish at Long Johns. Fried oasters were fishy and soggy. The crab soup was bland. The only thing that was good was the onion rings."}
{"text":"UPDATE: it is clear that the owner of this place cannot handle negative feedback because he messaged me regarding the situation. My boyfriend and I didn't eat \"every last piece of food\" that is a LIE. We both ate our sandwiches but we were starving. I also informed him that since we never planned on returning, EVER again, I didn't feel like being bothered with returning the food; we just paid the bill and left. TRUST ME, don't spend your money here, it isn't worth it. Also, Yelp is supposed to be HONEST feedback and by the message the owner sent to me, it sounded as though he didn't want ANY negative feedback. I understand he feels his food is good, but this comment is just my opinion and the TRUTH. I'm not going to LIE about my experience just to make the business happy. Like I said, it's just my personal opinion about the food served here.

If I could give it no stars, I would. We just came from there and I wouldn't suggest ANYONE eat there. People in Vegas don't have any tastebuds, so don't listen to the reviews below. I'm from Hawaii (fresh seafood) and my boyfriend's from the South (best tasting seafood) and we HATED it!

We got one crab cake sandwich, one soft-shell crab sandwich and a pound of crawfish. I had the crab cake sandwich and it was bland.. it tasted like something that came out of a box, nothing special AT ALL and nothing like the waiter described. It came with a simple tartar sauce that gave it SOME flavor.. it sucked

The crawfish were small, and FLAVORLESS.. well there was some flavor, and it was all butter and grease with a hint of \"spices\" they put on there.. it was WAAAAAAAY OVERCOOKED and the tails were the smallest I've ever seen.

The soft-shell crab sandwich had no meat. It was all shell and hot grease. When you bit into it all you tasted was crunchy oil. It sucked.

It was the worst dinner ever and I will NEVER EVER go back.. I wish I could throw up all of the food we just ate; it is THAT BAD. 

I could have spent my $35 at the Red Lobster across the street. this place is NOT WORTH IT. please spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very nice service! Food was pretty good and the oysters were very fresh. Not too big of a fan of the crab cakes but loved the oyster sliders. Their happy hour menu is pretty great!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that Crab Corner opened on Rainbow and Sunset. I took my friend there for a belated birthday lunch as she is from Maryland and loves good crab. 

We got seated at a table in the middle of the room - no biggie - except that the waiter mentioned that it is much warmer in this area. The restaurant was absolutely freezing! I had a sweater on but my friend had a light sweater and was miserable cold the whole time we were there. 

The waiter was attentive except he had his cell phone out and was checking it in between talking to us which was very annoying. He was very informative and went into detail about the menu along with the specials. Both waiters were running non-stop but did check in with tables. We did not get a refill of our drinks which was disappointing.

We were served soup in Styrofoam bowls - REALLY! The soup was very good but we had to eat it quickly as it cooled off fast. The crab cakes we ordered were excellent with 1/3 pound of crab and was served on fun red plates. The homemade coleslaw was very good and definitely a great side. 

I would like to try the blue crab and other entrees but not until the place warms up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Place!!!! The best seafood in town!!! Just had the Lobster Grill cheese!!!! To die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a crabcake sandwich, a softshell crab sandwich, a bucket of crab legs, and fries. SO GOOD!!

A must try."}
{"text":"bought a restaurant.com coupon for this place .
ordered the peel & eat shrimp 1 lb   18.99  $  and 
1 crab cake with corn and hushpuppies  16.99  $.
the crab cake was pretty good , but kind of small for what you pay .the shrimp tasted weird . seasoning was not good ."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this place. My son has been there and said it was good. First of all the the calamari was very chewy, I have never had calamari that was so chewy that it made your jaw hurt. Food started to come out...we had order two lobster rolls, kids chicken fingers, clams, cheeseburger and blackened mahi mahi. Everyone food but the cheeseburger and mahi mahi came out, waited another 20 minutes or so for the burger and then another 15 for the mahi mahi.  Waited another 15 minutes for someone to come by to so I may ask for tartar sauce, after no one coming to attend to us I got up and walked over to the bar where the server was sitting on her cell phone to ask her for some tartar sauce.  Waited for another while and thought maybe they forgot about us since we had to call out if anyone was there to give us our check. I had asked prior to leaving because they already had added the gratuity which I felt was not deserved.  They had stated that their internet was down and they needed to run our cards the old way imprinted. After walking out they closed the place early due to Internet not working. I called and spoke with Rina, manager and explained how I felt I shouldn't have had to be forced to pay for the gratuity at a certain amount when the service was bad. Rina apologized and said your card was not run due to Internet being down, which I checked on my account and it wasn't. She stated that the next morning she will run it with a gratuity of my choice minus our drinks...didn't happen. Checked my account first thing and it was run first thing for the full amount. So I called. Spoke with Rina, asked what was going on, mind you she was to call me first thing this morning to give me a new total amount. She now explains that the card was ran last night, but wait I thought the Internet was down? She puts Richard on who is the higher up and he can't do anything says he has to talk to the owner. I finally said you what forget it. I just can't believe this place. Never going back for sure, be careful if they tell you their internet is not up and what they charge you. They brought out the burger without the side and when they did bring out the side it was an upgrade and here we are thinking fires comes with a burger. Food is just ok for the prices and the service is horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Although it's a Maryland crab shack, the food reminded me of my hometown New Orleans food. The fried catfish was hot and crispy. The head on shrimp was excellent. The boiled crabs were good, too. Going back tonight to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Food was ok. But the service at this place the worst I've ever had. Was at the restaurant for an hour once I got my food server never checked on us, no refills, never asked if I needed anything. Finished my food and sat there for 15min waiting for my bill until I got his attention to be able to pay couldn't wait to pay and get the hell out. 
Then when I looked at the receipt they actually have a suggestion to tip 18-20-22% seriously!! 
A tip is earned based on good customer service which this workers gave none. Disappointed at the management of this place."}
{"text":"I decided to give \"Crab Corner\" a try after driving by so many times. I had never had crabs in the shell before so was a bit worried when we arrived. There were about 10 people dining when we arrived and I got a look at what they were eating before we ordered, The staff was very friendly and offered suggestions on what to try. We ordered 4 crabs to start and when they arrived the staff took the time to show us \"how to eat a crab\"! They were very tasty so we ordered 10 more and I also ordered a crab cake, onion rings ,fries and 4 ears of corn. Everything was tasty and very fun to eat. We will return. The only complaint was the soda as well as the water had a weird taste so we ordered a bottled water and a beer."}
{"text":"First off, I used yelp and found this place and had somewhat high expectations. After browsing the menu I ordered a whole lobster and was told they are out. I ordered king crab legs and they come with a seasoning salt that was too salty to eat . I ordered a plain order and it tasted the same . Thought they were supposed to be steamed but tasted like they were boiled and the water hadn't been changed in a while. I ordered a fried oyster appetizer, and was told they couldn't do that. There was no appetizer but there was an entree on the menu. I will never eat at this place ever again. You're better off going to hot and juicy or the boiling crab instead.  I am only giving them two stars because the service was decent."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after recommendation from a coworker.  The service was excellent. Food was great the hush puppies were amazing!!! Would definatly come back. Staff took great care of us!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood, seafood, seafood without The Strip prices. Lobster, crab legs and oysters were re-donkulous! Hush puppies were my favorite side!"}
{"text":"Who knew crabs in Vegas would taste so good!? Came here with some friends to watch football and eat while slinging back some beers.  The crabs taste the way an east coast girl would expect; old bay flavor, juicy, plump and fresh.  I also enjoyed the hush puppies, and might say they are the best I have tasted to date.  Don't show up here expecting a cozy, date environment.  It is loud, bright and down right cozy.  Be sure to try the steamed clams and asked for extra bread to dip.  I hope this place expands to the west side some day!"}
{"text":"Eat here whenever I feel like seafood. Haven't had a bad experience so far. Great service and amazing crab legs and shrimp."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday at 730pm. Half the seating wAs available. They have 9 tables total with seating for about 56 people. 

We were greeted immediately once we seated ourselves. Our drink order was taken and delivered within 2 minutes. 

We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell. A dozen blue crabs half male, half female. We had a yelp coupon for an additional crab with an order of a dozen. Additionally we ordered snow crab legs and crab cakes with hush puppies and potato salad. 

Food started being delivered about 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating here. We got seated quickly but it there was only two other tables there. We ordered a bottle of wine, crab dip, split crab Cobb, and than got a 1/2 lb of shrimp and a whole pound of crab legs. Everything was covered in a immense amount of old bay seasoning. We asked a few times for water and never received it. The service was not that great. It was just overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good was excellent. No grease and not oily made the meal enjoyable w/o a mess. Serves was good and a good feel environment I'm definitely going back for more"}
{"text":"Good food and nice service but nothing special. Filled our seafood fix! The iced tea  was watered down but the hush puppies were fantastic! We heard the other location has better quality food so we may try that one."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday, great food, lousy service with only 3 customers to wait on.  It would behoove management to support staff in learning the connection between the importance of providing customers with good service and the staff's employment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It is owned by two brothers who are two of the nicest guys you will ever meet. The staff is very friendly and treats everyone like regulars. There is a Red Lobster in the same center that cannot even compare to this place. The beer selection is very good and blends well with the food. This is a true Maryland crab experience....hammer on the table and spice to dip in. Watch out when deals go on Living Social---it sells out fast!"}
{"text":"Crabs are still the reason I keep coming back.
I recently had a chance to try their clam chowder. It was thick and creamy. Not alot of chunks of vegetables like some chowders but it had good taste and the clams were tender and sweet. i would get it again."}
{"text":"The only real reason I come here is for the Blue Crabs. I use to drive across town to the other location to get them, I like the other location better but I also don't want to drive farther than I have to!
I usually get them to go, so the people I have dealt with on the phone and at the front door have all been nice and my food has always been done when promised.
I will continue to go here as long as they keep getting my yummy blue crabs for me to buy!"}
{"text":"After 4 times of planning, I finally made it.  I went to the Crab Corner on S Eastern.  Go there during day time. You will thank me.  It is just like being in Baltimore. Parking is in a  strip mall. 
My wife and I both ordered a crab cake sandwich.  I seek out crab cakes where every I go.  It is nice to go to a place where Old Bay spice is available.  
The crab cakes came out after a short wait. The crab cakes were large, served on a larger roll with lettuce and lemon and a sauce on the side, along with fries.  Old Bay was on the table to added on both the fries and the cake.  The crab cake was a mix of lump and claw with little filler.  It was also cooked with bark on both sides.  It was very good. 8/10
Check the pictures for seating. The staff was great and could not have been any nicer.
Ciao"}
{"text":"It was such a disappointment today at this Crab Corner in Rainbow.There was 1 server in the whole place & getting help from the Bartender.First of all this restaurant should be ashamed of serving this \"regular size of a female crab\" for $4 each & when u open the tiny crab it has barely meat inside.This little tiny, unhealthy crab is not even worth $2! A bottle of Heineken is $5!!!! It's bad enough the service is horrible & pricy as hell!!!! The waiter was by himself in the whole place so he's kind a rushing me to order, to top it off he has a personality of a blank wall!!!! So I intentionally didn't leave a dollar tip & honestly I didn't even wanna pay my $110 bill for a 6 tiny crab with barely meat inside, 4 baby oysters for almost $2 each, 4 mini crab cake for $10, nasty lobster bisque for $6/CUP & 4 small sides for $3 each & 1 bottle of Heineken for f******king $5 & last but not the least 2 crab cake platter for $28 freaking dollars! SUPER  PRICY WITH UNBELIEVABLE BAD SERVICE!!! Never again will be back & I will make sure to tell every soul I know not to eat at this place ever again!"}
{"text":"Loved the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Being a Maryland girl I'm picky about my blue crabs.  I ordered small crabs & larger ones.  The small crabs seemed a little over steamed.  The meat was mushy like mash potatoes.  So, I let the waiter know and I had them replaced with the larger size.  The meat was delicious!!!!  I should have went with the large crabs from the start.  The decor of the restaurant made me feel so at home.  Funny thing, the waitress sat my husband and I at a table that had a picture of downtown Annapolis above it, that's where we're from.  I had the biggest smile on my face when I saw it.  We live in LA now and whenever we're in Vegas again I'll definitely go back.  They also ship which is a plus!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the 2 crab cake platter.  The crab cakes were some of the best we've ever had.  Lots of lump crab.  The fries were very good as well.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"No one here, is it a sign of the times, or just the time of day? It's late for lunch and early for dinner, so, perhaps, we're here during their off time. It didn't seem to long before the place filled up and every table was full! 

We were greeted by one of the Brother/onwers, he suggested the lobster bisque and I am a fan, so we said yes right way. We also tried the crab dip on bruchetta. Both of these were specials for the day and both were very satisfying. Big chunks of crab and flavored well.  The bisque was very creamy and needed just a bit for lobster, but we found out later, that was about the last of it for the day!

We then got a dozen large Maryland crabs steamed with not your Old bay seasoning, but JO Spice, which the owner tells us,  it's Maryland's version. The brown paper came out to cover our table, we were given our hammers and a quick demonstration on how to open them up and away we went. It was a bit of work but the big pieces of crab just melted in my mouth!  

You should know that there is a bit of \"goo\" that's not very pleasing to the eye, and doesn't taste very good, at least to me, so you really have to clean that stuff away, and it's a little messy but worth it to dig out the meat!

I enjoy eating a meal that leaves you feeling good all inside, and this is one of them! I know I'll be back, the service was great, the food was fresh and very tasty, the prices, a little steep, but, fresh crab in the desert, you figure it out!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience trying crab corner. My family and I ordered a little bit of everything on the menu to get the full experience. It was my hope that the crab would be very meaty and flavorful. This was not the case at all, the mussels were very tiny and had no flavor, the king crab was good but had no seasoning and was quite salty and pretty bland and the blue crab, well that was an adventure all in its own because when we finally got to the meat it wasnt worth it because there wasn't much to eat. To top it off we ate inside and somehow our food was surrounded by flies. I am not one to write reviews but if youre expecting anything close to hot and juicy or boiling crab like I was you're in for a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Fun, Friendly, Family environment. Good old Crab cracking. Place is just clean enough to let you know seafood eaten goes down in here!  Staff was great, food was tasty, they have cold beer, they have tv's, they have seafood.  #winning"}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars?  Best cream of crab soup and best crab cakes ever.  Food quality is really good, and I am from Maryland.  Recommend if you're in the Southwest."}
{"text":"We love going to  Crab Corner in Vegas. The only place we keep going back to for real Maryland crabcakes outside of Maryland! Crabs flown in fresh and Boardwalk fries just like the ones in Ocean City. Full bar, lots of beer on tap.  All perfect for a transplanted Virginian who misses the Maryland crab."}
{"text":"For any native Marylander living in Vegas, this place is a dream come true.  And believe me when I say, no one knows seafood better than the East Coast.  

If you want real seafood in Vegas, this is the place to come.  I love my blue crabs.

Best seafood in Las Vegas, handsdown."}
{"text":"Maryland native here! We visited the crab corner for happy hour. We ordered the crab pretzel, crab cake slider, 1 medium male blue crab and a snowball. Starting with the best- the crab! It was amazing and I can't wait to eat more when we go back! The pretzel was pretty good and did the trick to satisfy the craving. The crabcake sliders were pretty sad but I imagine it was since it was happy hour. The snowball wasn't shaved well enough. But guys.. THE CRAB! It was so worth it. If you're coming to the crab corner get the steamed MALE crab and you'll be happy! And I will add that the place was clean and service was reasonably fast."}
{"text":"Great hang out place, came in on a weekday. Ashley, our bartender/ server was very friendly, knew the menu very well. She recommended the crab cakes, they were delicious! Lots of crab, very lite breading. The platters are very nice to share! We will definitely be back to see Ashley, and explore the menu a bit! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this second location and I have to say...I wasn't impressed. We came on a Sunday and they had a lot of football fans there but only 1-2 servers, so service was super slow. Our server, Jared, was cocky with his responses to questions we had, like \"how much are the steamed crabs?\" among other things. I got the crab cake platter like I got last time and again, this thing is not worth it. The size is fine but it's the most bland crab cake I've ever eaten and I used to live in the North Virginia area where it's pretty easy to get good crab cakes. I say save your money and go somewhere else. The food and service aren't worth it here!"}
{"text":"Awwww, Crab Corner! We were so excited, based on the reviews we read.  The first surprise was the cheap storefront appearance, as we were expecting a real restaurant experience. The paper towels and plasticware didn't help, but I figured they put their money into their food. 

Amongst the three of us we tried the fried catfish, fried clams, hushpuppies, pulled pork sandwich, fries, crab cakes and- of course- the snow crab legs. 

The hushpuppies were fried too hard, but would have been great otherwise. The catfish was also fried way too hard, but the fish inside was melt-in-your-mouth good. The clams weren't as over-fried. 

The pulled-pork sandwich wasn't a big hit (and wasn't especially attractive) but the little container of barbecue sauce went over well, if that says anything. It was way overpriced for being just a sandwich -it should've been half the price. The Boardwalk fries were all right but the special seasoning just tasted like salt to us. We didn't like the crab cakes at all, but appreciated that they appear to be made with real crab. 

Finally, the service was off. A couple of orders were forgotten, one order was incorrect, and the two servers, who were both friendly, seemed overwhelmed with being responsible for everything from  taking orders to clearing tables to cashiering. I'd hate to see what would happen if the place was more than half-full.  

The crab wasn't anything special. I guess there's not much you can do with crab except ruin it, which they didn't do.  It was $19.00 for just the crab legs and no sides, which didn't impress my S.O., the crab eater of our group. So I hate to say it, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Was searching everywhere for a casual place to get mahi.  When i walked in i almost left due to the fishy smell, but im glad i didnt.  The blackened mahi was awesome and so were the green beans, hush puppies and home made chips.  Been here twice already and will be going back.  The prices are very reasonable too"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. Great Crabs, Awesome owners.  They truly care about their service and the people that come in.  Cant beat the Boardwalk fries with vinegar. I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to try a taste of maryland and especially the people from back east!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious FRESH seafood. Not frozen like the strip. Taste is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, very disappointed in the quality of food and im sure my shot of Hennessey was a much cheaper brandy called paul mason. The bar tender was very nice but I will pass on this establishment. Also, the place was very dusty and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned since it opened."}
{"text":"Went to have a Fathers Day meal last night.  We loved everything about our meal.  Service was excellent and my crab cake sandwich was super.  My better half got fried clams.  We will be back many more times."}
{"text":"This was an amazing seafood experience.     The crabs are as fresh as it gets.  The two owners will take the time to guide you on how to get the best out of the crabs and assist you with menu choices. The place is impeccably clean and nothing can beat the price in relation to the value received. Thumbs up! A must for seafood foodies, don't miss out on the male crabs!!!!  The real authentic experience for crabs in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at this place and it was mostly the service that made it a fun time. We had bought a living social deal to try the food and the two guys who waited on us, I believe their names were Dave and AJ, were so friendly. We've never done crab maryland style so they both took the time to show us how to do it and made it a really lighthearted and silly experience. The food is a bit pricey for the quantity, especially the appetizers, but everything was tasty the crab was really yummy! We also had beer and watched football, they even put the game we wanted on, which added to the charm of this place. It is the type of place with awesome food and a chill atmosphere, we will definitely return to mallot some crabs!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  We started with the mini crab cakes, moved on to the Maryland crab soup and finished up with soft shell crab sandwich.  Delicious!!!!!!  We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Loved loved this place. Me and my bf have enjoyed our multiple visits to this place. However Thursday night we both decided to meet up and have dinner here. Next day we both woke up with stomach aches. But we were ok by mid day he was on the toilet non stop, had to cancel his flight, and I couldn't even get out of bed. Nauseous, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and chills. Urgent care says possibly food poisoning. So needless to say won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The little hole in the wall feel is there, the people the server are okay. The food, well, the shrimp was over cooked, the crab was mis repressed. The bright point was the crawfish. The seasoning was good and the cook was good, but that was the only redeeming quality with the cook. The drink I ordered was watered down( no joke) 2 shot scotch was 1 1/2 water and a spit of scotch."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food! Very slow service! They need to hire more staff because there were only two people waiting tables. So, food not that impressive and slow service. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Loyal Hot-n-Juicy fans might be biased about this place but we certainly enjoyed the different taste and flavor at Crab Corner. I prefer some spicy-hotness but when it comes to crab, I found I like to taste the crab meat more to itself than too much added flavor. They offer different order options but your bill overall maybe a bit higher than \"other\" place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic MD crab eating experience and not to expensive. Same seafood the major casinos use! Have deals during the week and looks like they will be expanding to the SW. Finger lick'n good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of the Jerry Seinfeld routine \"Even Steven\" from the TV show.  For everything positive I want to say about it there is a negative.  So I will present the Even Steven review for your consideration.

We had a deal from one of the local coupon sites and it sounded great.
We arrived and were a bit surprised it was in a strip mall and had a decor similar to several other hole in the wall establishments.  This in itself is neither good nor bad as some of the best and worst places are in similar locations.

We sat down and were informed the blue crab was on special for $3.00 each.  We ordered King Crab legs, 4 blue crab, and a place of fried shrimp and clams and a cup of maryland crab chowder. For the sides we had boardwalk Fries and potato salad. (Starches yum)

The waiter brought us our drinks and we watched others fill bowls with crab meat.

The food arrived quickly ( a positive)
But the waiter almost threw the crab on the table as if he was in a hurry to get away. (a negative)

Other people had bowls and butter (a positive) but we were offered neither of these. Ultimately we asked for and were given very small containers of butter. (a negative.)

We were provided with a Mallet and regular forks to use for our food.  The Blue Crab were small.  We were offered no instruction on how to crack them open even though the waiter was aware it was our first visit. (a negative) The meat we could get out of them was very tasty and well cooked. (a positive.)

The King Crab Legs were steamed and pre split (a positive) and tasty especially with the butter.  

The soup was excellent with plenty of crab flakes and a strong hint of crab flavor.

The side of potato salad is one of the best potato salads I have tried. (a positive) but the boardwalk fries were a disappointment, arriving soggy and flavorless. ( a negative) The crab seasoning kicked them up a bit though. (a positive). 

The fried shrimp and clams were good.  You could taste the difference between the clams here and the fast food ones you might get elsewhere.  (POSITIVE).  However, the portion was rather small for the price. (negative)  We didn't even get wet naps after to help clean up.(negative)

In fact, overall, while the food itself is good, it certainly wasn't worth what our bill resulted in.  The prices charged were along the lines of the nice strip casino located restaurants but the food portions, quality, locations and atmosphere do not support the price point.

I will say the manager or owner was very friendly with all the customers, the bathrooms appeared clean and even had a sign to talk to the manager if there was a problem, and everyone did enjoy themselves.

With a great concept, this might have gotten 4 stars with a better price and service but if you like the Maryland crab concept, don't mind getting messy and have a few bucks to burn, you should enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Feeling crabby (literally) I went to the Crab Corner with all intention of being disappointed.  When my order of mini crab cakes arrived, I was pleasantly surprised they were full of flaky, sweet blue crab.  Very tasty without much in the way of added flavorings to take away from the crab.  That led me to try the combo fried clams and catfish plate with hush puppies.  The clams were thick and sweet but the catfish a bit dry.  The blue crab soup that came with it was delicious.
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week with some friends.  When I walked in, my buddy said, \"Dude, what crab place doesn't have crab legs?\"  Then, I wandered over to tank of crabs which had only 3 of them.  One of the three was doing a \"headstand\", i.e. was dead.  I haven't worked in restaurants for a number of years now, but I\"m pretty sure if there was a dead fish in the tank, the manager would have ordered somebody to fish it out of tank, and out of the public's view.  I had catfish for the first time in my life.  It was really good.  The corn was really good, too!  There was some type of trivia game going on where a woman was reading questions and playing music.  It was hard to hear her, and kind of random.  Not sure I will be itching to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Crab Corner eastside location.  It was almost full at 2:00 PM. Very casual atmosphere in a very unassuming room in the corner of a strip mall. They have a special several days a week, Wednes day is Lobster day featuring a 1 1/2 lber for $19.95. We had Crab Legs, Crab Cakes, Lobster Bisque and 2 sides. The Crab cakes were absolutely excellent and the bisque was very tastey. The service was excellet by two very personable young men both wearing I Got Crabs in Las Vegas TShirts. A bit over priced, but a coupon from LivingSocial took care of that. I will definalely do back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Definately one of my new favorite spots. The crab was sweet, the crabcakes full of crab not filler, soft-shell crabs tasty. Overall an excellent experience. Will recommend this place to all seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"I remember sampling this place at its original location on the Eastside about a year ago.  It has since expanded, fortunately much closer to home.  It is as good as I remember it and then some.

It went from a small local joint to a hub for sports, great food and Maryland patronage.  One of the head honcho's, I believe named Jay, was still on the front lines getting down.  During our first meeting, he was kind enough to offer us deals on flying in bulk crawfish in from the south since we mentioned that we often threw crab and crawfish boil parties.  In fact, all staff are very welcoming and good peoples.  Not too mention, it's good to see some Pinoys competing in the industry that I have learned to be cornered by some old timers and my Viet homies, especially in Cali (ie. Boiling Crab, etc.)

The menu has expanded as well.  Aside from the typical grinds from hush puppies, fish/chips, oysters and crab cakes, I noticed lots more added such as (real) crab dip and bacon wrapped scallops.  

But the fact remains, this place is built on cornering the niche that no one else has in the valley, blue crab!  Not just any old blue crab, Maryland style baby!  Although some compassion about the work expended when eating crawfish and blue crab, it's all about the entire experience, not too mention, these crabs are streamed just above rare, I can just imagine Katsumoto uttering...perrrfecct #lastsamurai.

Topped with that Maryland spice and throw in the Filipino vinegar, and you got yourself a feast line no other.  The trick is to get the large or jumbo female blue crab, that way when you pop em open, all the savory goodness can be enjoyed with a bowl of white steamed rice, gotta get yo starches in complete the meal.  Booyahh!   BTW, my wife says the (real) crab cakes here is one of the best she ever had [Drake voice].

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, happy hour starts at 2:00 p.m. and ruins until 6:00 p.m.  what a way to put a cherry on the crab cake.  I gotta go with the drafts for $3 a pop and the Crabby Mary is definitely a treat.  Just know, this place is ran by Terps, yet no turtles are served in the menu.  So if you root for the Ravens, the Terapins or anything else Marlylandish, roll through and be ready to get crackin'."}
{"text":"Today is my first time here and the food is delicious. They have the best oysters and crab cakes!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Ashley, Sam and the whole staff at Cram Corner. Thursdays are always awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was mediocre. I got the grilled salmon. Salmon was a bit over cook and pasta was very plain. Over priced for what I got."}
{"text":"Great crab cakes, decent lobster sandwich, not-so-good service. We used a GroupOn when we tried this place, and you could almost sense that our server stopped giving a crap about us once we mentioned it. He assumed we would be cheap and treated us like it. Walked by numerous times without asking us how the food was or if we needed anything. had to ask a different server to bring the extra condiments we requested when our server dropped off our food. Not sure if our server was having a bad day, but he just was not friendly. 

As for the food, we Really enjoyed the crab cakes. the bacon-wrapped skewers were pretty good too. The lobster sandwich/roll was a bit of a disappointment. small and not very tasty--just ok.
 
Overall, we might give this place another shot eventually, but this place has a lot to work on if they want to be legitimate contenders with Hot n Juicy and Boiling Crab."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!

Gee, how in the world do I start this? 

Well first, the oysters are so small, so laughable, that when they were brought to me, I actually thought that someone pulled a prank on me.

In short, no, no one pranked me. There was no candid camera, no Ashton Kutcher running to me to tell me that I was punk'd, and I'm not entirely sure if it could have been John Qui√±ones from 'What would you do?' running out of scenarios. 

I also ordered a lobster roll, which was a poor amount of lobster to justify the cost, in what seemed to be a garlic bread bun....like, garlic bread from the supermarket freezer that you throw in the oven. Ok so maybe I was setting my expectations too high, I had gone to the Westgate the previous night and had a top notch lobster roll there for relatively the same price, and was craving another one closer to home.... but that to me was a sad excuse for what a lobster roll should be.

Don't come here if you like generous portions, great tasting food, and getting a bang for your buck.

DO come here if you like small portions, subpar seafood, and an unsettling, ghetto and corny atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday and had a great experience. Although they were 30 minutes from closing, they kindly seated me and a friend. They were an attentive staff without the pushiness. I wouldn't recommend going at that time, only because I know what it feels like to just want to close up early on a weekend, but they impressed me. I got their Mini Crab Cakes, Snow crab legs that were so good - they didn't even need butter, and Black Mussels that had a garlic butter broth that made the bread I dipped into it melt in my mouth. Definitely will be back for their Oysters on the Half Shell and Crab Cake Sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved the entire experience! This place is an everyday joint with superb service and great crab. Order the biggest crabs you can for easier picking.

Never had Maryland crab and didn't know what I was missing. Super family friendly too... Every kid loves to smash things with a wooden mallet! We're thinking of going back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Always a fun time!

Ashley is an awesome bartender! Super personable and great company. 

Def would recommend to others."}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh. The service was so so. It could have been better. Not to mention the thin Asian server that had her boyfriend hanging by the register and the first and then in a booth. She seem to be focused on him more than the business. He was there the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Happy hour oysters is all I gotta say!! The oysters tasted clean and fresh. Not that grimy fishy taste at all. Also order a shrimp salad slider, eat and peel shrimp and blue crabs which were all good as well. 

Service was great. We were checked on several times by the staff. Will be back again"}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Vegas and I decided to bring the family here based on the many positive reviews on Yelp.  I should've paid closer attention to the not so positive reviews.  The bluecrabs were ok.  A lot of work goes into getting at the meat.  I can tell  some of the crabs were not fresh.  The rest of the family passed on the blue crab after their first one.  Leaving me with the rest.  I had to eat them to try and save face.  We also ordered their shrimp and clam which were also decent but nothing spectacular.  Here in the OC, we have the Boiling Crab which in my opinion always has fresh and tastier seafood.  Overall, the folks at the Crab Corner were friendly.  We problably wouldn't eat here again but do recommend others to try."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Crab Corner on 1/18/15. The restaurant was not busy that day. The server was real friendly and recommended the crab cakes. My drink was never empty. The food was really good. I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops as an appetizer and the crab cake sandwich. Everything was cooked perfectly. Not a bad restaurant. Also, it appears to be a great place to watch Baltimore sports as there are a lot of Baltimore sports teams displayed throughout the building."}
{"text":"Complete scam! Only come here for ayce if you have 2-3 hours to eat. They only bring out 3 crabs at a time every 20 minutes, so we got 6 crabs in one hour before I had to leave for a show. What a waste of time. Would not return."}
{"text":"*military discount* 

We were feeling a bit crabby so we went on Thursday 12-31-15 at about 6pm for dinner.  We were the only patrons and the two gentlemen there treated us like royalty...they were incredibly attentive and friendly.  

This restaurant is located on Eastern & Flamingo.  Their website says \"fine dining seafood restaurant\" but the ambiance there is very casual...some of the tables are picnic tables, they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and bottled beers.  

$45.35 got us crab pretzel appetizer, a cup of crab soup, a fried shrimp dinner, a baked tilapia dinner, two iced teas, and a side of fruit for the boy. 

Crab Pretzel ($10.99)is a Bavarian style pretzel covered with their famous crab dip and cheddar cheese.  The pretzel was soft and and the crab dip was creamy and wonderful.  Not too fishy and not too salty....I could eat a whole crockpot full of that dip! 

Maryland Crab Soup, according to their menu,  has \"lots of blue crab meat, tomatoes, lima beans, carrots, corn and onion, flavored with crab spice and served with an in-shell crab half\". Mine did not have half a crab in it...Maybe it's because I ordered a cup instead of a bowl?  I dunno...but I loved every bite of this soup.  I had the flu and it was freezing outside and today I feel 75% better and the soup may or may not have been a magical potion that cured me.  

Fried shrimp dinner ($13.99) came with about 20 lager-battered shrimp and two sides.  I chose the sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The shrimp were so delicious...lightly fried and perfectly seasoned...I wish I could eat these every day.  Their side salad was spring mix with onions, croutons, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Their ranch is definitely hidden valley and I would pick a different dressing next time.  

They are rather pricey but it's expected for good quality seafood.  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place was so good. The soft shell crab sandy was awesome. The crab cakes were meaty and fresh and the catfish and oysters were so good. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I have such mixed reviews about this place. I should start out by saying I've been to both locations a handful of times, and the Rainbow location is actually much closer. However, their food and service is horrendous... I haven't been back in over a year, and don't plan on ever going back. 

The food at this location is much better. But the space isn't as nice, and the bathrooms are gross. They have been every time I've gone. They also have a server who is very \"interesting\". Tall guy, and don't get me wrong, he's very nice. But I could have sworn he was high. He talked and acted like he had just smoked a bowl in the back. My husband thought maybe he had a learning disability? Who knows. Anyway, when you can catch him (he moves around in slow motion and seems kind of oblivious), he comes over and is very kind, and talks to you... A  LOT. We were all starving on Friday night. He took our order, then proceeded to talk to us for about 5-10 minutes. I didn't want to be rude, but all I could think was \"Please... Go put our order in before I eat your arm off!\"

Food was pretty good. My son's friend got the snow crab, which looked awesome. But I just don't know if I can keep justifying the price for the atmosphere and service. The food is good, but not great."}
{"text":"Went back again to give this place one more chance on a Friday night during Lent.  I shouldn't have.  And, I should have known, because the place was almost empty on a Friday night, during Lent.  I ordered the same dish as before; cod was still bad.  It didn't end there though... I was given marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce for my shrimp, and half of my hush puppies were straight up RAW inside.  Once again, I left disappointed, and will not be back again.  It's a shame, because we need a good fish restaurant on this side of town.  Sadly, this isn't it.  Still two stars though for their awesome potato salad (it's now really the only thing I can count on there), and so-so service.  Not good, but not horrible either.  I'm wondering if it's worth trying the original location that I fell in love with, but not sure it's worth the risk for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, prices and service! I'm from Maryland visiting family here in Vegas. This place made me feel at home with all of the Maryland decor. The staff are very friendly and I had a great time eating here with my family."}
{"text":"A little too much on the Old Bay Seasoning but everything is nice and fresh. The interior could use a little sprucing up, though. The lobster is huge, fresh, and tasty! Service was decent and the wait for your food isn't that long. Overall, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Tuesdays & Thursdays have the $2 female blue crabs special. Sometimes they offer AYCE crabs, but you'll have to check their Facebook page for those updates (just called to get that info).

Let's get service out of the way first. It was pretty simple and what's typically expected. We got checked on about twice but what I noticed was that I was too busy eating and it was nice not to be bothered so much. But if you had needed anything, all you had to do was just let them know with eye contact or a wave of your hand. My sister brought up how she didn't like to be checked up on too much so that's when I noticed that we weren't bothered too much. There was a fairly good amount of people when we were there (around 5:45-6:30pm on a Tuesday night).

I grew up eating crabs so don't hurt yourself, people! I ordered 8 crabs with my sister for $2 each and we also got corn on the cob and hush puppies for our side orders. Those are nothing special. Hush puppies weren't too bad but you can skip out on the corn.

The crabs didn't have THAT much meat (not what I'm accustomed to, at least) so it's just whatever. The experience was nice and I would actually come back. I'm a bit lazy so having crabs cooked and prepared for me is my kind of deal. The location isn't convenient for me but I would drop by if I'm close enough. We actually drove down there just for that today. Definitely worth a return visit :]."}
{"text":"Best Crab Cake EVER!!  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly with lots of crab!  And I mean large pieces if crab meat.  2 pcs with onion rings and Maryland crab soup, $29.49.

The daughter got the kids chicken fingers.  $6.99.

Take-out included a 1/2 pound of peel and eat shrimp ($9.99) and 1 lb of little neck steamers ($11.99).  I wasn't a big fan of the shrimp because of the seasoning.  But the shrimps were cooked perfectly.  Juicy.  The little neck clams are heavenly.  1lb is just not enough.  

We are coming back. :) 

The service was great and the restaurant clean.  Friendly and accommodating!  Patio seating was wonderful.

See you again soon!  Thanks for the great eats."}
{"text":"Great food and our bartender Sam was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. If you like soup try the Maryland crab soup, it's made fresh daily. I may become a regular here"}
{"text":"I was hoping to be able to put 4 or more stars like so many others have but I cannot.  The food isn't bad, the service isn't bad, but I cannot say this has been a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Had a paint night here and the drinks were good! Sangria isn't on the menu but you can still order it and it was super tasty. Bacon wrapped scallops Were so good I ordered another one. Crabcakes weren't that good and they were falling apart before I could dip them in the tartar sauce. Also had the mozzarella sticks which were really good."}
{"text":"I guess I'll be that guy. Came here on a Tuesday night around 645pm after doing some grocery shopping. Wasn't busy, maybe 3 tables in use. 

The two guys working were very friendly and patient. No issues with service. Specials explaining were blue crab 1/2 off for dine in. Ordered oysters on the half shell, a bowl of lobster bisque, sweet potato fries, and 8 regular blue crabs at $2 each. Oysters were small according to my friend. Lobster bisque was ok, nothing special but at $4.99 a bowl fair price. 

Then the crabs came out. Fairly small with a pile of seasoning on top. No butter, no lemon, no sauce of any kind. We ate a couple then decided we would rather have butter, lemon...and my friend wanted her special thai sauce so we had them provide a to go box. Well, getting them to go created them going back to full price. Fine, whatever. Doesn't make any sense to me but its only an extra $12 for 6 crabs. 

The crabs weren't of the the highest quality. I've eaten crab in a lot of places, including Baltimore. I was not a fan of these. Almost felt like fast food crab. 

I won't be back, and I can't recommend the place when there are so many better options out there. Maybe I was spoiled since I went to Joes Seafood and Stone Crab just a few days prior, but no....it was just that this place wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is perfect!!!!!  I love this place. The half shelled oysters are amazing!!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Wasn't expecting much, but man was I pleasantly surprised. 

Crab soup was amazing. We ordered it for my toddler and the adults ended up stealing it. Mini crab cakes were delicious, not a lot of breading. The entrees were great too. I had catfish and shrimp. My only complaints are that the delicious oysters were so small and our server was attending to the entire restaurant, which made for slower service. But the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Crab Cake Platter, crab cake burger, shrimp Pasta Alfredo, Mozzarella Cheese Sticks, and Buffalo Chicken Wings. Homemade Potato Salad, Sweet Potato Fries. Delicious. I recommend this place is fun and they have hammocks to relax."}
{"text":"Wow! Place seemed like a hit. I hade a 2 item combo! Shrimp which was ehhhh frozen restaurant warehouse boxed shrimp. Fried clams which were 5 stars. I had potato salad and for 1.50 extra a crab soup. Pretty fair place. I have been to them all hot n juicy and boiling crab. The problem? It's 245 am approximately 12 hours ago I was finishing up. I'm now sitting on the bowl and have a case of brown water. With what is now my 3rd round of barfing. Incubation period for food  poisoning is 9 to 12 hours.......... BINGO. So thanks guys from the bottom of my .......... Fart"}
{"text":"Took the family to the Crab Corner last night, and I must say how disappointed we were. First off the staff was polite, 2. The place looked dirty, looks like the place has not been cleaned in a while. It was a place U see on Kitchen Nightmare. My daughter had to use the rest room and could not even make it back there due to a horrible smell that was coming from the rest room. My wife had the clams and oysters and was so disappointed because they use more breading the clams or oysters. I had the wings and they tasted like they were cooked in old dirty oil. Seems to be a theme here DIRTY. The price for a PBR was 4 bucks.... Really it's PPR. For as dirty as the establishment is there is no way in hell they should be charging these prices and claiming they get fresh seafood on a daily basis. The lobster tank had 1 old run down lobster in it. To top this all off their supply of beer is just stacked in the restaurant. The same beer they charge an arm and a leg for. This place needs a major makeover and clean up. The sign on how to eat a crab looked 15 yrs old and was dirty. No one has taken a sponge, some cleaner and hot water to this place in a very long time... We were not impressed. Glad I got a deal on Living Social!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food: The crab cakes were delicious. The crawfish was fresh. The catfish was well-seasoned. They have certain days where crawfish and crab are offered at a discounted price.

Service: Very friendly; relaxed.

Ambience: Feels like a family-owned restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to get crabby in Las Vegas this is probably one of the best places to do it. We narrowed in on Crab Corner after trying to find some friggin crab-cakes in this town...not an easy task. 

So Crab Corner has a ton of variety: steamers of different crabs, shrimp, clams, mussels, raw oysters....all the things you'd hope to expect they have. Prices are pretty steep...but I guess we are in the middle of the desert so all that sea-life had a fun plane ride to get to you. 

We did end up getting the crab cakes and they were pretty good - very meaty without much filler. I actually think they could add a wee bit of filler and a few veggie bits to increase the flavor as they were actually kind of bland. They came with tartar sauce which I think is kind of a foul to put on crab but I eventually did anyway since I got kind of bored with it. 

I highly recommend the oysters. They're usually $1.75 except on Sunday's when they are $1 each. I believe they are a type from Virginia somewhere...they are the variety with the smaller but deep shell so they're more meaty. Great flavor and freshness.

The service is awesome! The people there are nice, helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"I won't be back here. The food is average yet expensive and the service is bad/rude. I will, however, throw a shout-out to the Crab Corner over on Eastern Blvd though...they were super nice. So I highly recommend you try that one instead.

I ended up getting a \"Combo Platter\" which is your choice of (all fried) cod, shrimp, oysters, catfish, clams or chicken strips. I asked if I could get steamed/boiled shrimp instead of fried since I didn't want to consume so much fried food but was told no. Unless your body is used to eating massive amounts of fried food you may want to steer clear of this. I felt awful and hated myself the rest of the day. 

Our server, Jared, was well past the 'unhelpful' threshold and operated in the 'rude' category. Here's a fun exchange showing how helpful he was (verbatim):
Me: How much are 6 crabs?
Jared: They are priced by the dozen.
Me: How much are a dozen?
Jared: What size?
Me: ?...Medium.
Jared: $64
I think this whole exchange could have been shortened. But granted he did then tell me 6 would be $32 since I apparently don't look like the type that can do complex math with the facts thus provided. 

As I awaited him to come by so I could request the check, the ample time allowed me to check-in and find a deal for \"any beer for $3\"! Thanks Yelp! I asked to apply that to my bill as well as inform him we'd be using a Living Social. He balked at this saying you can only use one \"discount\". I scoffed right back so I was allowed to use both after a talk with the manager...\"but just this once.\"

Now I'm not sure if anyone else is with me, but I don't consider Groupons or Living Socials \"discounts\". They are marketing tools made 1) to get customers into the restaurant, 2) are pre-purchased, and 3) are known sunk costs. Whereas discounts/coupons are used to get people in but that's where the similarities end - they do not know how many people will take advantage of it, etc. Who's with me?

Well we could talk the finer points of economics all day but I will close with the fact that I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time. Just a casual little place but so delicious! Probably the best seafood I've had in Vegas. The manager, Mike, was super personable and helpful. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  A hidden gem in southwest Las Vegas. The lobster bisque was outstanding. I would visit just for that. The crab cakes and softshell crab sandwich were very good."}

That's all."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, fresh seafood. Super friendly and fast service (though don't rush it)!"}
{"text":"I am from Maryland and this is the best. Crabs are like being back in Maryland. Plus real Crab cakes with jumbo lump crab meat. They make their own Old Bay potato chips which are to die for."}

{"text":"They have a patio and access to the bar from the patio,  which makes it perfect during the warmer weather! They also have some cool, yellow swings on the patio... nice!!! There's a bartender named Ashley, she works on Thursday and Friday, and she's amazing! Great service, fun personality..."}
{"text":"Excellent crab cakes and the blue crabs were amazing.  Salamat! ;o)"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight. (1st time with a Groupon). Food was really good and the hush puppies are amazing. The Sweet Potato Fries were disappointing and very bland. The reason I'm giving 3 stars was the service. We were promptly seated and had our order taken... BUT then never got drink refills. We also had to ask for the check, and  had to ask 3x for more sauce. Spending 40+ dollars for 2 people I would have liked better service."}
{"text":"First off I must apologize to Mark & John Smolen; I frequent your shop once or twice a month for the past year and a half and not only have I only checked into Yelp twice I've yet to write a review for your fine establishment.  That just goes to show you when I show up all I can think about is seafood so well done! 

If you are from the east coast specifically the  DC area you will love their store! It has a ton of MD items and is only slightly nautical theme, most of it is football etc;  on entering the store you will be overwhelmed with the intoxicating elixir of the nautical gods Old Bay; I love the stuff and knew my search for a local seafood restaurant was done. 

I judge a restaurant on its menu; is it full of items or does it keep to the basics with only a few main dishes that they specialize in? their menu is simple seafood and more seafood. If you want whole crabs or legs these are the guys to patronize; If you want the best darn peel and eat Shrimp this is the place to go. 
The oysters are huge but be prepared, the last order wasn't cleaned thoroughly and stomach contents from the oyster came shooting out as you bit into it and or cut into them;  if the rest of the meal wasn't perfect that would have ruined the meal but my group laughed it off and moved onto the next course.  Just be prepared if you order them they aren't the chain restaurant oysters. 

If you like crab but aren't comfortable with shucking and eating whole crabs don't be scared; the owners and their staff will be happy to sit down and walk you through it just let them know you will need assistance; their idea is that they want you to get the most out of your meal and have a good time so you will tell your friends and return with them the next time. 

Prices for the crabs can fluctuate depending on the season and availability but don't let that deter you either. They are very competitive and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Anytime this guy gets homesick or is craving Seafood he heads over to the Crab Corner!"}
{"text":"I was so happy of the thought of fresh seafood.  Nice choices on the menu, friendly waitress and hostess.  However, our food took to long to come out.   We waited way over 30 minutes. Even the lobster bisque came out slowly.   Along with the lobster bisque we had mini crab cakes, shrimp dinner beer batter onion rings, potato salad,shipped wrecked sandwich and a couple of oysters with garlic butter.   The crab cakes and the oysters I would highly recommend - great taste for both.   The shrimp had more bread than anything.   The sandwich was okay.  Lobster bisque was plain with very little lobsters and the taste was \"blaugh\""}
{"text":"My first experience in a Maryland style seafood house, and a grand experience it was.  

Visited on a Monday Night during Monday Night Football.  The special at that time is half off appetizers.  We got down on an 8 piece mini crab cake plate and crab dip on baguette.  The crab cakes were probably 80% meat, and were delicious.  I can't wait to try the large size one. The crab dip on baguette was rich and creamy, quite delicious as well.  Again, lots of crab, not a lot of filler.

Next was Maryland Crab Soup and Lobster Bisque.  The soup had big chunks of crab with Lima beans, tomato, and half a crab sticking out of the cup.  Very tasty, served up hot.  I am partial to bisque and have had it many places, but the only one I have had that was better than this I paid $12 for.  This was $3 (when bought as an add on to dinner plate).  It was thick and creamy, with little bits of lobster floating around in it.  Excellent! 

Next was the peel and eat shrimp, swimming in lemon and old bay.  I wouldn't know, but my girl told me it was about as authentic east coast as you could get.  She deftly peeled and ate, while I mangled most those I touched.  Food tastes better when you earn it.

Finally, we had three deep fried soft shell crabs.  Well seasoned, and very satisfying to eat.  As she put it, \"You aren't really at the top of the food chain until you eat an animal whole\".  

Give this place a shot!  If you don't like it, walk yourself over to Red Lobster and cry into your cheese biscuit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local spot to invite out of towners.  I never go wrong when bringing tourists to this place.  Any seafood lover will be very impressed with the choices and the freshness of all the seafood served. You can't go wrong with this place! Please yourself to a bucket of crabs, mussels, or whatever!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed.  Ordered a half dozen of the large and there was barely any meat.  Not worth price.  But the fries with their crab mix on top was good"}
{"text":"My original bad review was removed for lack of specificity.  So here is the original review with all the detail a person could want:

Skip it ... trust me.  Bad food bad service, bottomless mimosas were 90% orange juice.  

(1) Skip it: if you are looking to try somewhere new my recommendation is that this place should not make the list.  I was not impressed with the food the service or the overall experience.  

(2) Trust me:  with extended family in Pennsylvania and Maryland I spend my summers growing up in the northeast.  My grandmother made Maryland crab cakes at home, and we tried the Maryland crab cakes at dozens of establishments across Maryland.  I am no expert but I can tell the difference between good and bad crab. 

(3) Bad food: we started with the bacon wrapped scallops.  The bacon was charred and the scallops were so overdone they were rubbery and difficult to chew (if you haven't had scallops they should not be rubbery or chewy).  We then had crab dip which was not dip at all.   It was mushy crab goo piled onto small slices of bread.  The flavor left a lot to be desired and the consistency was the straw that broke the camels back.  After a bite I opted to move onto the next thing.  Now the true disappointment, the crab Benedict.  Let me first say, I LOVE crab Benedict ... just not this one.  I didn't know you could butcher the concept of fresh crab, hollandaise sauce and a poached egg, but crab corner figured out how to.  I made it about halfway through before I gave up.  The flavor left something to be desired on every front.  

(4) Bad service: here is the kicker.  Had the the service been great I might have overlooked the bad food, but it simply wasn't.  There were 2 male servers sharing the responsibilities for the restaurant.  They tried to be attentive (I think) but failed miserably.  We went long periods with empty drinks (mimosas that were supposed to be bottomless, sodas, tea and water too), and plates on the table that needed to be cleared.  I also respect that many places have a limit to bottomless mimosas, but it would be nice if the only notice of that was not a waiter (who had been previously ignoring us) announcing with a less than polite tone \"you've got 20 minutes left, do you want anything else or are you done?!\"  Sure let us know we're coming to the end of our bad experience, thanks, but at least do it politely!  Our server did finally crack a smile at the end of our meal, but by then it was too late. 

(5) As for the mimosas, maybe some people like a mostly orange juice with a splash of champagne.  I on the other hand, do not.  But I'll let you judge this on your own should you choose to make a trip to this skippable restaurant.  

I imagine that it's reasonable to have a review removed that's not specific enough, but I doubt anybody is asking to have reviews removed that say \"this place is great\" without any details.  So I hope this review had all the details you ever wanted about my bad experience.  Happy dining!"}
{"text":"stopped in with my wife during out vegas vacation because I had a groupon and we love seafood.  food and sevice were great we ended up going there 2 more times.  Can't wait until we come back to Vegas, first stop crab corner."}
{"text":"We had been to a different location and it was good! But this location sucked... didn't taste the same and the service was really bad. At the other place as soon as you walked in they treated you sat you down gave you bibs and wet ones to wipe your hands. Your eating seafood... and want to keep it off you.. this location says they only offer them if you ask... how do you now if they have them if they don't offer... I had to ask the server if it was even the same company because the experience was so different... I GIVE THIS PLACE 1 STAR. They closed the location I had gone to. I don't recommend this seafood restaurant at all!!! Food tasted dirty still and salad was not that great. Potato salad was way to salty. Sweet potatoes were ok but needed some type of dip to give more flavor. My son has eaten seafood before but this day he ate the blue crab  male that they only had had available and he had an allergic reactions. I asked the server if they had anything for it and her remark was he looked fine. They didn't carry anything. She took her time on Checking us out...  lucky there was a chevron across the street that had meds. Never again..!!!!! Prices are way to high for such low quality"}
{"text":"Best part of this place was the service. Our server was very courteous, helpful and quick. Food came out timely, but not rushed. We had a few things from the HH menu including dozen oysters (fresh, but on the small side), bacon wrapped shrimp (tasty), and calamari fries (fried like a chicken tender).  We also had lobster bisque (way too salty), crab soup (reminiscent of Manhattan clam chowder), and soft-shell crab dinner. The garlic green beans and onion ring sides were perfectly cooked. 

All in all, the food was good, but I have to say I didn't feel like I got a great value even with the HH deals and the Groupon we had. It's not particularly expensive per se (as we regularly spend way more for a good meal out),  but I didn't feel like anything knocked my socks off. But I gave an added star for the great service. 

We had a good time here, particularly with the great afternoon weather on the patio. There are a few hammocks that were fun for my daughter to play around while we waited for the food."}
{"text":"Crab Corner was so impressive the first time we ate there, my wife and I went back with our friends the next night. 

just a great restaurant! The crab is awesome. Tried all their crab... Blue Crab was excellent and very authentic Maryland style. The king crab was juicy and sweet. Add seasoning and butter and it's probably the best king crab I've ever had. 

I usually don't care for snow crab but Crab Corner nailed it perfect. Sweet and juicy. 

Definitely ask for a bib because it will get messy. 

Crab Corner is a different style vs Hot n Juicy, so it's not quite fair to compare."}
{"text":"The best seafood restaurant I've been to in Vegas by far had the Garlic Steamer and it was so good I could have ate it all by myself but had to share with the hubby lol but all in all a very good place."}
{"text":"six of us were there for dinner last night. the food was not fresh but frozen .nothing was made in house everything i had was frozen and deep fried. shrimp haddock french fries and hush puppies. other friends had crab which was impossible to eat  because they had no crab forks. the waitor informed us the owner did not carry them saying guests stole them. however you need the fork to eat your crab, the service was horrible only to be insulted with the tip included.i do not recommend anyone to dine at this property.no crab forks really its a crab destination."}
{"text":"10 dollars to smell.  Well, that's what they should charge.  Amazing for the sniffer.

I got an order of Blue Crab, halved and cleaned, in garlic butter.  $11.99/lb....eeeee owww.  Served with rice.  Awesome.

It was gorged in butter, parsley, and Old Bay - it was delicious.  The problem is that with all the necessary work, the food turns cold after bite #3.

The service, gents, were very nice and gregarious.  The ambiance turns a corner of a mini-mall into a pretty good Maryland-ish vibe.

All in all, save yourself the work.  Go for crabcakes or a crab salad sandwich, and call it a day."}
{"text":"This place is definitely an OKAY spot to go to in Vegas. 
After driving by it from work everyday my mother and I finally decided to come inside. The service is outstanding. Best down to earth servers ever. The wait wasn't too long, but that's probably because there were only four people in the restaurant.
I ordered simple crab legs while my mother got the crab cakes, which she enjoyed- although she wished the portion was a little bigger. \"The bread shouldn't be bigger then the inside,\" I believe were her words.
The crab legs I ordered were very delicious and juicy and perfect. But they were the only thing on the menu I actually wanted to order. Most things seemed like a waste to order at a crab specialty place, so my only real option was to just order crab legs.
If this place had all-you-can-eat crab legs, I would probably spend every pay day here. That would just be fantastic.
My only real issue with this place is the menu and the taste. Both are just okay. Nothing that really wow-d me, but I would definitely go back again. Just not because I love it or hate it, but because I crave seafood all the time in short."}
{"text":"Super inviting environment, great place!  Ashley makes it a comfortable and fun, best bartender ever!!!"}
{"text":"Server was very friendly. I ordered the Mahi Mahi blackened with green beans and Brussel sprouts. 

The waiter arrived with my food and immediately apologized for the small fish portion. Not a good sign. 

Green beans perfectly cooked, hot fresh and great garlic flavor. Sprouts crispy on outside and tasty on the inside. Very nice. The fish...not so good. Great seasoning but very, very dry and tough. Tasted like it had been frozen, thawed, frozen again, then cooked. No moisture at all. Like eating an old steak. 

Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"First of all, this place were truly a seafood place, they wouldn't have beer pong.

They should call their Lobster Roll a Lobster DOG.. $16.99 for a Lobster Roll served on a cheap Hot Dog Roll fried in butter with little lobster meat??? No thank you. I have had amazing lobster rolls packed with meat in downtown Boston for just three dollars more.

As to their other food items, I wasn't impressed. I am not a fan of fried food, and everything was fried. I feel like there was little meat on everything we tried... And for the price, you could do MUCH better."}
{"text":"I have been interested in trying Crab Corner for ages now, but finally got a chance last night to dine there with a friend.

The restaurant hasn't changed much since it was Three Tomatoes and a Mozzarella. Interior is pretty similar, but still nice. They had a band performing which was a nice touch. They weren't overly loud or distracting which we were concerned about at first.

I had really intended on ordering crab, but got derailed and instead ordered the two item combo with fried shrimp and oysters. I should have stuck to my first inclination. Although my food was ok, the fresh seafood options looked so much yummier and I stared enviously at other diner's meals. I tried a bite of my friend's crab cakes and they were delicious. I'd come back for those as well as during their happy hour for some blue crab or oysters.

Service was a little slow and we had to remind our server for refills and to bring our check, but for the most part I enjoyed our meal here and look forward to trying them again soon."}
{"text":"I actually had only crab when I came here for the first time with some friends.  The crabs themselves were ok, not a big fan of the blue soft shell crabs but at least they were only $2 each.  

My main order was a fried platter of fried oysters, fried shrimp, hush puppies and sweet potato tots.  The only thing that disappointed were the fried shrimp.  After the meal, I felt like I overpaid for the quality of food I got but it satisfied my craving for fried seafood.  I've definitely had better elsewhere though."}
{"text":"I love to get my crab on at the Crab Corner. 
Sometimes, I'm in the mood for good ol' basic crab.  No garlic, no crazy spicy sauces... just good ol' tasty steamed fresh Maryland blue crab. 

I have been here twice now, for the $2 special on Tuesday and Thursday, and plan on coming back often.  Not only are the crabs deeee-licious, but the artery clogging goodies:  hush puppies, fried oysters, and fried calamari are tasty too.  Wash it down with a refreshing $2 beer- and life is good.  

They also have other seafood items such as crawfish and lobster which I plan to try on my next visit.  I have tried the steamed shrimp and personally, it wasn't my favorite.

It is family owned and the staff is awesome. The fountain drinks are self serve, but when it isn't that busy, the staff will come by and refill them for you, and they always make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy the crab picking experience: hammer, bucket, plenty of napkins, lemons, etc. They are some of the friendliest bunch I have ever met.   

They definitely know their crab, heck, they have been doing it for years as a seafood wholesaler to the local Las Vegas restaurants and recently opened their own restaurant, fall of last year.  And I am so glad that they did- because I love to get my crab on!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Flamingo location until they closed about a year ago . This is a true Maryland crab house run by 2 brothers from Maryland . They get fresh seafood in everyday and the quality rings true. I've had crab , shrimp, and the soft shell crab here. Soft shell is just a favorite of mine and l don't know of any establishment here that does it better ."}
{"text":"The Crab Corner is a great find.  The staff are super friendly and helpful and the food is really good. They also serve beer and have tons of specials; all you have to do is ask what's the special that day.  They're also a great place to watch games.  The owners are from Maryland so the whole place is decked out in MD gear.

When I went here, I had eaten crabs before but never whole crabs and I never had to de-shell one before.  Our waiter was nice enough to dedicate some time to showing me how it was done, what parts were what, and all that jazz.  

The boardwalk fries are delicious.  The same seasoning also goes on the crab if you ask and by itself the seasoning is tasty.

The tables are covered with brown paper if you order the crabs so you can be as messy as you want.  Don't forget to use lemons on your hand when you're done eating though so your hands don't smell all day!

This is a great place to go with friends, family, or date night.  I just wouldn't recommend a first date if you're going to get hands on with the crabs.  

Date night seal of approval!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place..... food is excellent try the crab cakes and the soft shell crab amazing. The atmosphere is so relaxed and informal...... just a relaxed setting with great food...... friendly service and knowledge!"}
{"text":"The most excellent seafood but to my surprise I can't stay away from their home made potato salad. I crave it nightly."}
