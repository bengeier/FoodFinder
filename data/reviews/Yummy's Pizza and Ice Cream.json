{"text":"Yummy's Pizza is a gemstone! If you haven't tired this place recently, go out and grab their delicious Pizza, Wings and Ice Cream!!!   This place is great for families!"}
{"text":"Based on the recommendation we got a vegi explosion, minus jalapeños, add tandoori chicken with a caesar salad. Takeout.   The romaine lettuce was fresh. Didn't find any brown spots!  I personally don't like pizza but given our options on this day and where we were needing a quick bite I turned to the Yelpers.   I was curious as I was driving smelling the tandoori emanating from my pizza box. To our surprise it all was very tasty. The vegetables were fresh, there were plenty on the pizza. The chicken was a great addition.   As for the young woman working there she was very kind, friendly and smiled. Nice service always helps the taste of food.   And coincidentally, I love Pepsi!"}
{"text":"Just opened up yesterday! The restaurant is CLEAN, food is CHEAP, and the pizza is the best in the local area. The medium pizza is 14\", large is 18\"."}
{"text":"Service was good. Very nice girls behind the counter. We are glad we found this place. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this one.   They had tandoori check pizza and Indian options. They pizza was ok, the toppings fell short from 1 inch from the crust and the wings weren't any better."}
{"text":"this is a really good place. A co-worker brought it in for lunch. We had the Yummy Special and the Veggie pizza. Both were delicius! the Yummy PIzza is an Indian take on pizza. It is different but sooooo gooood! lol! Definatly go to this place!"}
{"text":"The tandoori and paneer pizzas were amazing!! They were the best pizzas I've had in awhile! If they were located closer to ASU I would go everyday"}
{"text":"Mild Chicken Wings were cooked exactly as requested and 3 Scoop Ice Cream on Waffle Cone was also very fresh."}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian pizza and it was legit !!!! Also had the tandoori wings and it was the best! I will be coming back here for sure.  It only sucks cause of the location, but some of the best places in phx are in crappy locations. This place is a must try!!! The pizza was on point. Crispy and slightly chewy and is what my wet dreams are made off."}
{"text":"Great concept with Indian, Italian and Mexican mix.   Love the Tandoori flavored wings, paneer pizza and chicken pizza.   Great food, great service and excellent food.   Tried various items and loved them all."}
{"text":"It was nothing exciting. Food was edible but wasn't worth the $22. The place was subpar at best. Serves was lacking. Milk shake was terrible I'm pretty sure it was just chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Too many bums are sleeping in front on patio tables really bad. It is awful, would not eat here at all"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the customer service is bad. They wouldn't accept the entertainment coupon I had and everything costs extra, including a 50 cent surcharge for using a credit or debit card. The girl at the counter was not at all friendly,  didn't crack a smile once. Its located in a really bad area, I was concerned that my car might get broken into while I was eating. All things considered I would not recommend this place. Grade D+"}
{"text":"I'd have the vegetarian explosion pizza again in a minute. I might ask for crispy though. The wings tandoori are equally worthy of the keeper list, but again I'd like them crisper. There are a bunch of sandwiches and salads that are intriguing and reasonably priced. Good parking in the rear."}
{"text":"The tandoori paneer pizza is definitely my new favorite pizza to eat in Phoenix. It's a bit of a drive from Chandler but worth the trek. Tried the veggie explosion as well and that was really tasty. Loved the mushrooms and cherry tomatoes on top. Overall, all the veggies come together to give you an explosion in your mouth. So it's aptly named. And they use fresh jalapeños! I would definitely come back and highly recommend those wanting something different on their pizza to try the Yummys specialty."}
