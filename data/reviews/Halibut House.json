{"text":"The Halibut House is an old-fashioned quaint little seafood shanty at the corner of 9th Ave NE and Edmonton Trail.  It's a cozy, cafeteria-style joint serving up darned good seafood at prices that won't break the bank.   I got a 2 piece Halibut & Chips for a very reasonable $10.95.  The halibut was lightly battered and golden brown, and flakin' fantastic!  The tangy tartar sauce was a tasty compliment to the tasty halibut.  The only negative I can find about the food is that the fries, which looked fantastic, tasted a little off, like the oil in the deep fryer needed to be changed.  Besides halibut, the restaurant also offers a variety of cheaper fish options, including cod, haddock, sole, and basa.  They also offer other seafood delights like shrimp, calamari, clam strips, oysters, and scallops.   I'd highly recommend visiting in the summer and eating on one of their many picnic tables out front, as the inside of the store is quite small and fills up fast. In other words, it's a seafood spectacular that's well worth a try.  A few nibbles and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to eat here on a regular basis and always enjoyed it. We came back today for lunch and were very disappointed. They have reduced the serving size of the halibut and chips by nearly half but continue to charge $12.95.    Also, my wife ordered a Greek salad and it came without feta cheese and kalamata olives; the two most expensive ingredients and what defines Greek salads. Oh, and you pay an extra $2 to substitute a Greek salad instead of fries.  I pointed these concerns out to the server who said that was how the dishes are now served. Based on this, I'd say this restaurant is in trouble.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week. We love the food. Fish and chips are fresh and delicious ! Staff are really friendly!!! I would recommend this to anyone. Please try it ! :)"}
{"text":"Very new, nice atmosphere a totally friendly staff. Nice to have more fish and chips options in #Ajax. They also have Greek salad, burgers and souvlaki!"}
{"text":"Halibut was neatly battered, fried just right. Not too oily but still had a good crisp to it. Got mine with Cesar salad...nothing to go crazy over. Girlfriend got the chips, much better side option.   Decor was bland but clean. Overall very good first experience! Service was also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just went there today for breakfast/brunch and we had the grand slam combo and halibut special. The staff is always very friendly and with all the breakfast and lunch specials (2.99$ for breakfast special and $8.85 for lunch), you can't go wrong. Gave 4 stars since dinner can get a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and take out order was ready in good time. Unfortunately the food doesn't make the grade. The fish was very tough and very greasy. The fries had that same grease coating to my mouth after eating. Portion size was out of balance - decent sized piece of fish, but enough fries to feed 4 (and I was hungry). Such a waste to throw out so much. The death knell to this place for me was the packet of fake green stuff that was offered as tartar sauce. If a restaurant wants to charge $12 for a one piece fish and chip order, make your own tartar sauce!"}
{"text":"Even though this is your typical hole-in-wall type of place, I had hopes that it would be a gem after reading good reviews on a foodie forum. Unfortunately this was not the case. Both my friend and I had the 2 piece halibut and chips. While the prices were very reasonable and probably one of the cheapest in town for halibut and chips, the quality was not there. The first piece I had was alright but you could tell the fish wasn't very fresh. The second piece was bad. It actually tasted fishy. And it's very rare to taste fishiness in halibut. The fries were pretty decent but since the fish is not good, I definitely wouldn't be heading back any time soon. Definitely not recommended for halibut and chips. I know we're in landlocked Calgary but I've had better here in town so there's no excuse for them to be serving fishy halibut."}
{"text":"I called ahead for a pick up order during the dinner rush. This was my first time ordering from the chain. A polite and attentive staff member took my order. Upon my arrival, the restaurant was filled with a mix of in-house diners and customers waiting for their take out orders.  I ordered the two piece halibut with one order of chips, and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  The portions were incredible, and the quality of food was way above my expectation. Being new to the neighborhood, I will definitely revisit this location and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are superb.  Big chunky fries.  Fresh, not frozen.  People behind the counter are very friendly.    The decor is a little bland.  it doesn't have that old wooden style of many fish and chips shops.  But I always take out so not a problem.  A little pricey if buying one order, but a pretty good deal if you get the five fish and three chips.  And the chips are pretty healthy portions.    They also have lunch specials, and specials on the haddock.  Don't like haddock and haven't had lunch there, but its good to know if you don't want a huge portion at lunch or like a cheaper fish.  The fish ( we get the halibut) is excellent.  Its pretty big and the better is crispy.  Batter is even,.  some places end yup with too much batter.   This is now my favourite fish and chips place, and I've said goodbye to the two other places we used to frequent.  I also like the candy jar on the counter.  You know the small ones, wrapped in shiny paper."}
{"text":"I've been to many different fish and chips locations, and this one is by far is the WORST place. The women working there was very rude (a little racist to be honest). She didn't bother telling us about the specials which appear to be all OVER the restaurant. It ended up being way too expensive and the pieces of fish were EXTREMELY SMALL.   In a nutshell STAY AWAY, you will find so many better fish and chips restaurants in the area with way better customer service."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon, just before their 3pm special expired (you get scallop, fish, chips, and shrimp for $11.99). The place is clean, staff is friendly (although a bit forgetful, which I'll chock up to them being newly opened). The halibut was delicious and batter wasn't too oily, you actually get a decent piece of fish unlike other fish and chips location where it's more batter than fish. We got our food pretty quickly too. Would definitely go back.   On a sweet note, for dessert, they serve dufflet cakes, so if you're craving something sweet go for the truffle cake."}
{"text":"Halibut House is great.  I am not sure why the reviews aren't higher, but the owner/manager of this franchise (Gary) is extremely personable as is the female that also works there.  I haven't spoken to anyone else.  The establishment is new, and clean and the service is quick.  The Fish and Chips are great.  The batter is light and airy, and the chips are pretty good.  I'm guessing the incident of not double frying was limited to one day.  I've been there at least 3 times and the fries have been on point.  Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new to Oakville. I dined with a friend and we both agreed that it was a good experience. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Halibut of course, and it was a good sized portion and it came with a fresh salad. I'm picky about my salads being fresh and crispy and this one was certainly fresh and the ingredients also. The premises is new, fresh and clean. I think you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service and great prices witg a weekend special.   Enjoyed the halibut and fish.  This a truck stop kind of spot but we enjoyed it as a family."}
{"text":"Living with fellow pescetarians, I've been dragged along to come here. Inside is spacious with monochromatic colors, boring and simple. To some that may be comforting and pleasant, to me, its unimpressive and they skimped out on presentation. Its run by a Chinese family and they are polite, fairly friendly and welcoming, and they have really great deals. All their meals are super affordable and you get a lot for what you paid for. So that's nice, right?  But what about the quality...as far as fish goes, it was a big, golden slice, and when cut through the crunchy breading, was flaky white halibut meat. It was incredibly greasy and oily, but it was enjoyed by friends and family. The fries were pathetic, soggy, greasy, tasted like they were refried. Some people think that the fish is the most important part...it's not, fries are as well. They compliment the fish.  Either way, it's a clean place with decent food for low prices, so its good. I'm not hating on it, and they seem to be doing well, so when you're in that area, stop by and try it."}
{"text":"It's 3.5  We had:  Halibut and chips with coleslaw ($13.95): Good nice piece of fish.  Lots of thick cut fries(above average). Coleslaw was okay.  Rating: 3.5/5  Haddock and chips with greek salad + shrimps and scallops ($15.95):  Nice fish and good batter.  Greek salad was okay.  Shrimp and scallops were average.  Rating: 3/5  Overall good service.  Nice comfy booth seating.  Lots of people ordering takeout."}
{"text":"Very good service. Halibut is quite good, reasonable prices. They also have burgers and souvlaki. The only improvement is if they could bolt down the booth seats which shift as one moves in and out, which disturbs the customers in the other side. A nice family friendly place."}
{"text":"I came and got the halibut and chips. It was just OK. It was not the best fish and chips that I have gotten in the area. There was almost no one i the place when I went. On the plus side there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Went to pick up some fish and chips for the Family but i wanted a burger. Fish was good but the Burger was very bad. The tomato they gave be was the ends and the burger was like 2oz of meat. Small burger with no taste, Small Burger from Mcdonalds has more meat and better taste for less the price."}
{"text":"Although you try your best to eat healthy and look after yourself, sometimes every now and again, you just want a plate of good fish and chips.  I mean, who doesn't love a crispy piece of flaky fried fish and some hot chips (fries) to go with it.  While Halibut House is not the best fish and chips I have had in the GTA, it is quite good and when I am in the neighborhood and start to get a craving for fried food (funny how that craving seems to occur every time I am in the neighborhood....), Halibut House is a great place to stop in and fulfill that desire.  The restaurant itself is pretty simple and straight-forward with no unnecessary frills.  It is essentially a diner with booths set up along the perimeter and tables occupying the middle of the restaurant.  The establishment is fairly large, clean, and open.  There is a take out counter in the back corner of the restaurant in front of the kitchen with a bench to sit on while you are waiting for your order.  Additionally, there is ample room for parking in front of the restaurant.  Service is generally friendly and efficient.  Servers are also generally reasonably knowledgable and able to answer any questions you might have about the menu.  Now, on to the food.....  I typically get the Halibut while my wife gets the Haddock.  Both fish get high marks for their texture and flavour.  As you would expect, the Halibut is a little more dense or meatier but still flaky while the Haddock is a bit lighter in texture and also flaky.  Both fish taste great.  The batter for the fish is good as it comes out crispy and relatively light so as not be too thick and greasy.  Additionally, the fish comes with a good portion of fries that I always find fulfilling.  I have also had the fried scallops and fried shrimp which comes with a seafood cocktail sauce.  Both the shrimp and the scallops are a good size and also quite flavourful.  My only criticism, and what kept this review from getting a higher score, is that the tartar sauce they use is the one that comes out of the little plastic packets.  While it's passable and helps to add some flavour to the fish, a good made-in-house tartar sauce is a pretty essential part of any fish and chip meal for me and this is where Halibut House may be slightly lacking.  In the end, however, my plate is always empty and I walk away feeling rather satisfied - that is, until the next time I am in the neighborhood and that craving starts to return......  Final score 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5."}
{"text":"food was like tourist trap area type food..............kinda disappointing was hoping for hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great selection of dishes with HUGE portions. The fish is fresh and not greasy. You can order many different side dishes however I do not recommend the mushy peas. It is not at all like the mushy peas at Danny's Fish and Chips and tastes like baby food purée. Also one of the younger waitresses has a bit of an attitude but the service is efficient."}
{"text":"We ordered take out fish and chips on Mothers Day.  Granted, the place was very busy but still, the food was terrible.  The halibut (if that's what it was) was almost absent beneath the batter and what thefe was, had a dry, leathery texture.  The fries looked and tasted like they'd been reheated.  The most edible thing was the tartar sauce in the little packets.  Five orders of awful fish and chips.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Great selection and delicious food. Always fresh and made the way wanted. Amazing customer service as well everyone is extremely friendly you feel like family"}
{"text":"Found the service incredibly slow for an empty restaurant. Didnt feel like they cared I was there at all.  The fries were cold and mushy and the slaw was tasteless. The fish itself was good though. The light batter was a welcome change to the traditional thick shell from most fish and chip shops.   I don't recommend this place overall. I've been 3 times because it's close to me and I wanted to give them a real chance. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Haddock -  Fish was battered and fried perfectly. Fish texture and taste was just right, did not taste rotten or frozen for too long.  Chips - Fries were totally off. It tastes like the ones you buy at the grocery store and fried in your own kitchen, but not successful.   Service - Although staffs were not rude, they are just mediocre. You order and then get your food. However, they were not knowledgeable. There are roughly 55 species of cods. I asked the waitress who took our order what type of cod is in the \"cod and chips.\" She stared at me as if I asked the stupidest question in the world and asked me \"what do you mean?\" I wouldn't accept a staff taking orders at a fish and chip restaurant and not knowing what type of cod is used in their menu.  Price - It's mediocre for what you get in return of food and services, can't say it's excellent nor horrible."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for this place. It's my new go-to for fish and chips that's nearby. Daily specials can not be beat here!! Where can you get a fish n chip lunch for less than $10 (per person) that's better than average (in my opinion)??  I'm not saying the fish is less greasy or the portions are huge. I'm saying I'm pretty satisfied with lunch here and I'm happy. The portions are pretty large and the haddock and halibut is pretty good. I haven't had a 'greasy feel after' having their food and I've had it before in other restaurants in the past.  I haven't dined in here but I noticed an eat in special for lunch as well. It's something I will consider one day. These days a fish and chips lunch or dinner will use up your weekly allowance (haha) but here you get a yummy meal for an awesome price. Well worth and more :)"}
{"text":"First day opened and they have a buy one get one special (January 10th only).   The halibut batter is divine. Light and crispy. Not the dark soggy fried batter a lot of establishments offer nowadays. The fish is full and hearty so it's a fantastic portion. The fries are also light and crispy which is nice surprise.   The coleslaw is refreshing and perfectly seasoned.   The staff is extremely friendly (it is their first day here) and the restaurant is clean, bright (windows are all around) a great ambiance and use of space.   There is also a parking lot (shared with the Pizza Pizza) so you will have free parking.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have never left a restaurant so disappointed before. The halibut was tolerable at best, and the chips were soggy; The food tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer for weeks before it was served."}
{"text":"Great value! Had the big breakfast 3 eggs 2 bacon 2 ham 2 sausage with home fries (crispy not soggy)  toast and coffee for 13 bucks with tax and tip. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro on a pita this evening and it was horrible. Dry thin sticks of meat, very little sauce on a cold dry pita. I'll never make the mistake of ordering it again. My wife did enjoy her fish though. However they only packed commercial tartar sauce packets. For a fish and chip place to not make their own is just lazy"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips restaurant! A popular trucker stop, one of my favorite places in the area. Friendly service, great food, and good prices. Recommend the halibut, either normal or grilled."}
{"text":"I go there often and have never had a \"fishy halibut\".  This is a great place to go for a quick bite.  Not too crowded or noisey.  There fries are always crispy unlike some places.  As much as I have been there I never get fishy halibut (thats all I order) And trust me I've lived in New York, Virginia, Florida, Texas, Washington, Hawaii and another Island all close to fresh fish so I hate fishy taste. And the prices are good."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch and had the cod and chips. The service was quick and friendly. We asked for the fries to be crispy and that is exactly what we got. The portion of fries was very generous but a little less so on the fish and slaw. They do have a lunch special, but we were told that it is basically 1/2 of the fish we went for the full order. Maybe next time if possible we'll get 3 fish and 1 fries and split it. Price was very reasonable and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm sure I'll come back here and my review will change (for the better), but I wanted to share my experience after my first visit a few days ago.   I was crazy hungry and wanted a pretty big breakfast so I ended up making a quick stop here since I was in the area.  Went straight to the take-out counter and was assisted right away by one of their staff who was incredibly friendly.  She took my order and advised me that it would be just about 5 minutes and she really wasn't kidding! I think it actually took me longer to decide what I wanted.  Originally, I was thinking of getting their really cheap breakfast special but I ended up getting one of their bigger platters with French Toast.  I'm picky with my French Toast but theirs wasn't too bad.  Nothing extraordinary, but it was good. Platter also came with 2 strips of bacon, 2 slices of ham, 2 slices of peameal bacon, 2 sausages and home fries.  The meal cost about $13++ and was totally worth the price as I had 2 meals out of it.  And to think, I was thinking of going to McD's for breakfast.  Glad I opted this instead.  If only they would include a cup of coffee to go with the meal or at least some eggs, that would've been great.  I'll give the entire platter 4/5 as it lacked a little from flavor and also a side of eggs."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good fish and chip restaurants in the city. No one wants supermarket Captain Whatever TV dinner stuff. Stopped in at Halibut House on Lake Shore Etobicoke for the Special,  Haddock & Chips Take out for only $7. Sunday and Monday.  At that price you can't expect much but It was delicious.  It was all freshly made, full size meal, not greasy, and the service was fast.  I was surprised how good the chips were. Lightly cooked in fresh oil. Perfect. I will be a regular customer.  Because Yelp uses automated software to filter reviews, sometimes good reviews are put in the hidden section at the bottom.Not sure why."}
{"text":"A lot better than I had originally expected! My sister dragged me here because she wanted this and I'm not really a big fan of fish & chips but this restaurant made me reevaluate my dislike for it. The food was very good and I am a huge fan of their tartar sauce. The only thing that I disliked about this was the oiliness. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"The fish was well fried. But the fries are soggy and greasy, the tartar sauce is packaged, and the staff arent too friendly."}
{"text":"the staff is absolutely incredible, and the food is such a bonus. I love coming here for breakfast, and most of the people I know love the souvlaki, the fish and chips and pretty much everything else. All around great restaurant. So glad it came to my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast, while the price is right the quality is not. Bacon undercooked, pancakes rubbery. The only thing done right was the toast. I will try again for the fish but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Saw the waitress use the same cloth she wiped floor with to wipe table . Won't be returning"}
{"text":"For me, I feel that Halibut House is not the best but not the worst - definitely somewhere in the middle. Hailing from Durham, this is a popular and relatively new joint that's quickly gaining a positive reputation amongst the community as a place for fish and chips that isn't super heavy or greasy.   Meh, I like my junk food junky...  The good: - Fish is fried lightly, and not heavily battered, for a \"light\" fried fish if ever there were such a thing - The prices are reasonable enough - Large space, so seating for small groups shouldn't be too much of an issue - Friendly service  The bad: - Ordered the haddock, which my dining companion found a little overly fishy - The soup - Totally a skip! It tastes like canned stuff, with an unpleasantly thick and cornstarchy consistency like the kind of \"cream\" soup you get at a lot of HK-style cafes - Not sure if the coleslaw is made in-house, but it tastes like the kind of stuff you'd get scooped out from a large bucket at fast food chains"}
{"text":"I went here today for dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience.  Walked into the restaurant and stood awkwardly for a second before I saw the sign that said \"seat yourselves\" and so I walked over to a booth. What other reviewers say are correct. The booths are not nailed to the ground so they move when people behind you get up from their table.  Anyways - I ordered the Haddock and Chips special which was... $6!!  I even had to ask the waitress if it was a smaller portion and she said that it was a regular portion sized, just a special.  I think the regular price is $8.95 so for $6 that was a great deal!  The wait staff here are very friendly. Everyone smiles a lot. They are visibly busy serving tables and it took a few minutes for a waitress to approach my table but when she did she was super bubbly and in general gave off a great vibe.  I also ordered a large Greek salad and here is where I will say that there is room for improvement.  When I think of Greek salad I think cubes of cucumber, tomato, olives, feta, red onions.  Well we got a bit of that but basically it was just a salad of ice berg lettuce and a couple of olives from a can, some slices of tomatoes, and some feta.  It was $5 which is a decent value and the salad is enough to feed 2 people but I wouldnt get the salad again next time. It just wasnt really Greek.  I feel like I paid $5 for lettuce.  When the Haddock & Chips arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find that the portions were very generous. A very large piece of haddock and lots of great fries. Whether these fries were hand cut or came out of a bag didnt really matter much. The important thing was that they tasted fresh. I drenched all of my fries in the malt vinegar provided on the table and used maybe 7 or 8 packages of tartar sauce. I loved that they were easily available on the table and I didnt have to ask for it. Unlike Blue Nose just down the street, Halibut House doesnt charge you extra for tartar sauce.  The haddock itself could have been better. I'm not sure if it was just mine but my piece of Haddock was pretty thin. The batter around it made it look plump and thick but when I cut into it I was a bit disappointed to find how thin it was.  It was still tasty but I think it was a matter of the piece I got and not the norm.  Water wasnt refilled but I didnt really finish my glass until the very end of the meal so it didnt really matter much.  I would definitely go back to sample some of their other menu items and for sure Id go back on a Sunday or  Monday for their $6 special.  A meal well worth the price."}
{"text":"I have become somewhat of a regular here.  I eat here at least 1 time a week.   I always eat the Halibut Fish and chips.  It flakes pretty nice, the cooks are very consistent, and it completely satisfies my cravings for Halibut   The staff itself are all very friendly and nice.  You can catch some CP24 and grab a Toronto Star with it.  (why do mainly old people eat fish and chips tho?  lol)   Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I found the place very big & clean. Only one waitress, but, she was good. Mondays, they have a fish & chip deal that is well worth the price. We took home a \" grilled fish\" for my husband, which was a big disappointment. Look like two pieces of white fish , steamed. Not appeasing to the eye at all."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price.  Staff is busy but friendly.  They have an open kitchen and a clear large menu,  but it can be confusing on ordering take our the first time.  (just walk through to the counter)   We have has the Cod and haddock  (5 fish and 3 fries for $31.95) plus Cole slaw and gravy for $40.05 taxes in.  Fish is crisp and flacks,  fries are homemade but a bit soggy (at least with take out).    They also have Souvlaki,  chicken fingers and wings, and salads."}
{"text":"It's your average fish and chips place. I think everything else on the menu is actually better than the fish and chips though. Breakfast is cheap and convenient. It's pretty much the only place in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok this place is just really awesome. Love the service, always feel welcomed here and food is excellent."}
{"text":"They have really nice big fish and a good deal on Sunday and Monday, they have amazing service as well, hardly busy durning the week. The fries just have to be cooked more"}
{"text":"The new Halibut House location in Pickering opened on Sunday March 20, 2016, and had a buy one halibut and chips dinner and get one free special for opening day.  With the deal, the place was slammed and we had to wait for about 25 minutes to get a seat at when we arrived around 12:30pm,  They were cranking out the halibut dinners as fast as they could, so you didn't have to wait long for your food.  The fish was excellent and the slaw was OK, but the chips/fries were not that great.  They obviously were not double frying them to save time because of how busy they were, and the fries were on the limp and mushy side.  I have eaten at their location in Ajax several times and while they never had the best fries, they were better than what we had today.  Hopefully they will clean up their act and improve the fries or I doubt I will go there very often."}
{"text":"This is a shining example in an already great chain of resturants.  The service was fast and friendly, we were waited on immediately, and the food came out fresh and hot in 5 min at the most. Food was delicious and the prices are great. Definitely put this on your list."}
{"text":"I have probably been here 6 times since it opened up. This is by far the Best Fish and Chips joint in the GTA. I have tried the Halibut, Cod and Haddock. The haddock is probably the least desirable type of fish you would want to eat. The Halilbut and Cod are excellent. The fish is cooked to perfection. Very light batter. Moist. Amazing fries. Quick service, excellent daily fish specials. They also have lunch specials for 2.99.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best halibut for its price in York region !!   Love the halibut here so much... Came here twice so far and I'm craving for more again!   They have All Day Lunch Special  halibut fish and chips$7.95 add $1 for drink / fish chowder  The halibut here taste so fresh. The batter is crispy and not at all greasy.   The fries were so-so though. Personally i am not a fan that's why this time I came back for only halibut which is so worth it for $11.   I would recommend this restaurant for take-out or dine in. It is a pretty big restaurant probably has at least 20 tables.     Service is also very attentive and polite!    I am probably coming back very soon !!"}
{"text":"Straight up fish and chips. I ordered the clam chowder soup too - I wouldn't recommend it, it was lukewarm and may have been just Chunky's. I also got mango icecream and made my own mango float with a can of 7-Up. Ice cream was a bit dried out at the top - but I did order icecream at the brink of spring, so it might not have been the freshest. The halibut and chips were great!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleased.  I got the Sunday/Monday special, haddock and chips for $6.00.  They have a number of different specials and they all range with different items. They have really fast takeout aswell.  They have tartar sauce in packets on the table along with vinegar. Salt and pepper and sugar.   I was not disappointed, I don't usually go out for fish and chips so I don't have much to compare it to but the fish was nicely battered, really fresh and flaky. The fish was soft on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside. The Sunday special comes with a 5oz piece of haddock and a lot of fries so I was really full with some fries left over.   The place is kinda like a diner, they have booths and tables. But it feels so comfortable and inviting here. The staff are very friendly, fast and attentive.  We got our food within a couple minutes.  The place is very clean aswell.  Probably going to be visiting again soon for the breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid fish and chips dinner, this place is the place to go. Having driven by it countless times, but never being sure of the quality, we finally tried it after a friend recommended it.   The owner was very friendly, and the price is right. Along with a wide selection of various types of fish, you can also get fried shrimp, calamari, scallops, and more. They also offer deep fried mushrooms and zucchini sticks in generous portions!   I don't think there is anything on the menu that isn't deep fried, but it's not like I was looking for a salad when we walked in. Will definitely be going back, when a good deep-fried fix is in order! They also have some great option of hard ice cream at a great price - yum!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have Halibut House on Easter Saturday.  Boy were we amazed at the fish and chips we got!  First off we visited a Fish and Chips place on Brock Rd. that opened up on Good Friday and were so disappointed with what we got.  Not only that but they charging 2.75 for every can of pop... (That's outrageous!)  We were so discouraged but decided to give a shot to Halibut House anyway.  First off, Gerry the manager of the location was absolutely amazing.  He was very approachable and kind.  My wife and I found ourselves having nostalgic/insightful discussions about a wide range of topics with Gerry.  The prices for the food were well priced and the staff besides Gerry were very friendly.  Since then we have visited 3 more times.  Every single time we visited it's been the same amazing service, great food and great conversations.  The fish is nicely battered and well cooked.  The chips are very crispy as well.  The best part for me is that the food isn't extremely oily like at other locations in Pickering.  Every single time we go to Halibut House in Pickering we are not disappointed.    This is one of the best Fish and Chips places in Pickering, you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 10/10 -- Service: 8/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 6/10  Halibut House is pretty ugly. Like old-fashioned white cafeteria style. But the food and service are why you come. And they deliver pretty well on both fronts.   We went for a late lunch, just missing the 2:00pm cutoff for breakfast. There's a $2.99 breakfast special right now, which is crazy cheap.   I got the two-piece haddock and chips ($14) and my friend got the lunch-size halibut special ($8) with a fish chowder ($1). The chowder was also ugly, but tasted decent. The halibut and haddock were both good and the fries were plentiful. In my opinion, everything could have been crisper. If the fish and fries were fried a little bit longer to have a little more colour, they would've been much better. But as is, they were okay.  The portion is no joke. As you can tell by the picture, the size difference between the lunch-size halibut and the two piece haddock was drastic. The two-piece was extremely filling, especially because you also get a lot more fries.   Service is really good. Everyone is friendly and attentive.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Place looks a little run down, but the food is surprisingly good. Had the halibut and it was fresh and perfectly fried. The fries are also done very well. Portion is decent size. Price might be a bit on the higher side which doesn't align with the \"cheap\" decor of the place and the subpar service, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Casual, diner-esque experience with quality food that is quite good! A place I frequent for breakfast and lunch, you can not go wrong with any of the breakfast combos, or fish and chip specials. The quality has been consistent, and the wait staff is friendly and polite. The breakfast seems to always have eggs and homefries that are always cooked perfectly. The fish is battered lightly, while the fish inside remains flaky and tender. The fries occasionally do come out with a darker fry, as a result of the dirty oil that it is fried in. However, I would recommend the fish chowder, which has a good consistency, and an abundance of fish. Huge fan of their coleslaw!"}
{"text":"The food is OK for fast-food but then had to wait for my order so not that fast. With little packs of sauce. Maybe put someone at the cash register that is able to pronounce and repeat what is on the order or is capable of speaking the language instead of pointing to the screen in discomfort. Put numbers in front, like other Chinese take away. 12,95 Canadian dollars for one piece of cod no fries, just fish. 2 and a half stars would be appropriate but you have to choose between 2 and 3. Not going back but fast food-wise definitely better than any burger, therefore a 3 our of 5."}
{"text":"No frills dining.  This is your typical fish and chips restaurant.  Choice of haddock, cod or halibut.  The halibut is $4 more than the haddock and cod.  Large portions, especially the fries and coleslaw.  If you like tartar sauce, it's unlimited (packets).  I also had their fish chowder and that was pretty good!"}
{"text":"We're fish and chip snobs, and while there is nothing wrong with this place, it's not as good as other places.  I found the halibut to be dry and not as moist as other high quality places.   On another visit we got the haddock and the portion wasn't that great for a cheaper fish.  Their fries were great but not worth returning.  Bluenose is better."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner with a coupon. Lunch sized Halibut fish and chips with cole slaw was $15 for 2. This was a good price. It was tasty.  We also ordered fish chowder at regular price of $3.95 each.We found it a bit expensive. The soup tasted good but it was not warm enough. The place was nice, spacious and clean. Staffs were friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place. We went there today for the first time. $3.49 for 1 egg, two pieces of bacon and toast and home fries. Not bad. I added an extra egg for 90 cents. Coffee was extra. It was tasty and not greasy. Service was fast. The restaurant was very clean. The only thing I'd like to see is non pork sides. They had sausage, bacon and ham. I'd love to see turkey bacon. But I was really satisfied and it was hard to finish my plate .. but I managed lol. Very Good!"}
{"text":"Nice to have fish and chips close to home. They have improved a great deal since they opened. Portion sizes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get I think. The fish was fried with thick batter and there was barely any meat under it. I basically ate batter"}
{"text":"The place looked nice from the outside so we decided to try it out. Inside the restaurant looks clean... not sure if it was because recently open for business. As we sat down and saw the menu and price, we started to regret coming in as we see the menu price is more expensive than the other fish and chip place we go in Milton and it didn't have much options as we were looking for. Everything is extra charges. Like kids meal, it didn't have rice option, extra charge to switch chips for rice and it included drink as pop. For more healthy option, kids menu should include rice and not just chips.   We ordered 1 halibut n chip, cod n chip and 2 kids meals. Total was $46.89 + tax + tips.   The plates were big but foods on it wasn't much. The fish crust is really puffy and crispy. As we cut it, there is a small piece of fish inside covered with fluffy batter. Very disappointed. Kids meal... I thought we ordered kids halibut fish and chip... it looks like fish sticks, 4 tiny piece of fish covered with batter. It was so small for my son that he took half of my fish. The rice we paid extra was in a small bowl, rice were hard definitely not the quality we were expecting.   I would only give one star for this place. My 2nd star is for the service we got from the lady with short hair. (Not the Asian lady who took our order and never came back).   Anyhow... I probably won't go back to this place again. For half of the price, there is a place in Mississauga for same type of fish taste. My best fish and chip place is still in Milton \"heritage\"."}
{"text":"Finally!  A fish and chip place in my hood!  I don't have to trek down to Caz's on North Service Road when I'm in the mood.  This place has just opened.   They have a variety for the fish, seafood, and chicken lovers as well.  We ordered the cheese bread to start and the seafood platter and halibut fish and chips with slaw.   The cheese bread was not memorable.  The ends were clearly burnt and they still served it.  It was sadly a spongy bun that had cheese put on it and then it was grilled/burned.  The fish was very good (both the halibut and the haddock).  The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly but I did find the batter a bit greasy.  The fries tasted like they were twice fried which results in a thin outer layer that is chewy as opposed to crispy.  Tartar sauce is mass produced food truck packets.  Why can't fish and chip places make their own tartar sauce??  That would make it the perfect topping for a lovely crispy piece of fish.  Service was quick and friendly and the place has a combination of comfy booths and tables with a bright open decor.  A good place to come when the mood strikes you."}
{"text":"My husband and I love fish, and Halibut House has got the best fish and chips in town! Amazing fish, price is great and definitely worth it. We always go here at least once a week now to satisfy our fish and chip cravings.  Ambience is excellent and the servers always make you feel very welcome!"}
{"text":"Best Fish & Chips I've had in a very long time. Been looking for a nice place to make my go to spot. I found it here. Very friendly service, clean comfortable atmosphere and most importantly tasty fresh Halibut ."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Halibut House Whitby with my husband and was disappointed with the dining experience.  We ordered the Halibut and chips with coleslaw.  First off the waitress made us feel rushed almost like she wanted us out quickly and never came back to ask us if everything was okay.  Had she come back I would have told her that the Halibut was dry and greasy as were the chips because the grease from the Halibut had dripped all over them; it was a big greasy mess. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Came here in hopes of finding some decent fish and chips but left unsatisfied and full.   Space is huge with lots of tables and a waiting area for take-out orders. Wasn't too busy when I arrived probably 2-3 tables. A little dated.   Service was mediocre, had to wave server down quite a few times to get this and that, wasn't much to write about. We got our food before cutlery.   Food was also mediocre, ordered the seafood platter with Caesar salad and opted for the poutine with a side of onion rings. Shrimp, scallops, and haddock were decent and edible but the poutine was bland, onion rings were the frozen-type and also a little over done, but the Caesar salad was horrible everything about it tasted off and was pretty much left untouched. Tartare sauce was the packaged type so nothing special about that either.  Price was OK but I rather go somewhere else and pay a little bit more to enjoy my meal. I wouldn't come back. I had pretty high hopes but maybe because i mixed up the reviews I read beforehand with a difference place upon arriving."}
{"text":"Clean and decent food.  Kids fish and chips is generously sized for less than $8 and comes with a drink.  Great deal, none of my older kids were able to finish.  The staff was friendly despite my baby making huge mess of her food.    Adult potions are pretty good as well.  Batter was tasty and not too thick or oily.  Fries were above average.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the daily special of the standard fish and chips, fries were cooked perfectly and the fish was great! All came at a great price too!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner.    What I liked was the fish, not too greasy and tasted good.    What I didn't like was * services was impersonal - didn't offer water, didn't check in if I wanted a refill on my pop or if the food was ok. * fries were bland, maybe not that fresh.  Could have been frozen * garlic cheese bread was almost like a hot dog bun opened up with cheese and garlic (over priced) * washrooms was super small (two small for more then one person - should be a private washroom) and smelled like bleach.  At least wait till the restaurant is closed before throwing bleach down everywhere.  Not running back there anytime soon. Maybe next time I'll do take out.  Too bad as they have a liquor licence and I like to drink."}
{"text":"We decided to go out today and try something different.  Something greasy.  Im glad we hit up this place.   It's a new and clean place with delightful service.  Despite older reviews, the food was great.  We ordered the haddock special.  (Mondays and Sundays)  Before you criticize, make sure you know your fish.  If you like soft and moist go with the haddock.  Their special came with small side of coslaw. The portion was perfect. And price was very affordable.  Definitely coming back.  Venue 5/5 Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Price 5/5"}
{"text":"Great experience. Food is good and priced accordingly. Would like to see homemade tartar sauce. The packets are basically mayo. Tonnes of fries with your order. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Had the Haddock $7 Sunday/Monday special.  Huge dish. Good but could have been a bit less oily.  Server was awesome"}
{"text":"My local go to joint for fish and chips! Friendly staff and I really enjoy the batter on the fish. I haven't been to other locations but I assume they're the same. It's a nice airy batter on your choice of halibut, haddock, or cod. My personal fave is haddock as it's a bigger piece of fish, flavourful, and flakey chunks of fish. They come with a large side of fries in which I can never finish so when I go with someone else, I usually order the 2 fish + 1 fries combo and share. I like my tartar sauce so I'm very glad that they do not charge for their sauce. I also noticed they serve breakfast. Loads of people we're ordering it but I did not. I did however got an order of their chocolate chip pancakes - YUM. 3 very large pancakes in my opinion."}
{"text":"We got take out from here tonight. We ordered 3 haddock and chip specials. They are only $6 on Sundays and Mondays.  First of all I want to say that I was born and bred in the UK. Also, this is what my family does, in the UK. So I'm gonna have extremely high standards for fish and chips. My dad has had his own shops since 1973. So I know a little bit about fish and chips. The fish itself is ok, batter is nice but the fish fillets are not completely battered. They are known as lightly battered, in the biz. If you fully coat the fillets, you end up with juicy fillets that are similar to steamed fish. And your fillet doesn't dry up and absorb as much oil during the frying process. Also, the sizing of the fish is not uniform. They are all different shapes and sizes. Not good if you happen to get a smaller fillet. The haddock is ok but a bit too \"meaty and dry in texture\" for me. Might be from being under battered and the moisture from the fish is all zapped out from the high cooking fat temperature. I prefer my fish much juicier. You should just order fully battered fish and eat only half the batter.  The chips are all twice fried which means that they are crispy but have a bit too much colour. They taste ok, but would taste better, if potatoes over here had a better flavour to begin with. Most traditional places, in the UK, fry their chips only once from fresh. They just taste creamier and flavourful, even with no seasoning.  Staff seemed friendly, helpful and the service was fast too. We enjoyed our fish suppers tonight but I rarely buy fish and chips, in Canada. But I would recommend this place to people. And if I get another craving for fish and chips, I would return here."}
{"text":"The Halibut house was alright, good price for what you got.  One  piece of Halibut and fries was $6.95.  You can get two or three pieces of fish.  I opted for the smaller portion.  Would have been better had it been breaded fresh then cooked.  Fries were excellent.   I think it should have been served with lemon and coleslaw. Seemed a little cheap of them not to give lemon.  I suppose it's available if you ask for it.  The owner was friendly and welcoming.   I might go back."}
{"text":"Go here on a Monday when they have their Haddock and Chips special. It's half price, which is about 7 bucks! Worth it and really delicious! The fish is perfectly flaky and the batter is not 90% of the meal like I've had at other fish and chips joints. It comes with coleslaw as well. Portions are also very generous for the price. I can never finish a whole order but it's so good that I basically force myself. Lost a star only because they don't use Heinz ketchup and I would have loved it with my fries!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today because I go to the one in Aurora and am familiar with this franchise.  Immediately greeted by front order desk by a friendly woman. I ordered 2 orders of Halibut & chips & Greek salad, side of gravy too. While I waited I noticed how clean the place was. Ok it's your typical \"mom & pop\" diner casual eatery that's serving mainly fried food but I didn't see one chip on the floor. The place was very clean-yay!  Now this location I found out, gives out coupons for a buy 1 & 1/2 price halibut & chips(using that soon!)  My order was takeout so I had a 15 minute drive to home; when I got home the food was still Hot! Points scored, the fish & chips were fried perfectly not greasy and my Greek salad was fresh & full of flavour no skimping on the feta crumble & serving size of the salad.  I have to say I'm really pleased I tried this location cause now I have two great locations to choose from when I'm hunkering for fish n chips. As I'm writing this review late at night I also wanted to say there wasn't a \"greasy\" after effect on my stomach. So for all of the above I'm giving this place a 5/5!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Halibut House.  I originally ordered the 5 cod special but noticed later that they had a $6 Sunday special (haddock + fries).  I wanted to change my order, but they had already put down the fish.  The owner/chef said it was okay, and would honour the Sunday special pricing.  The food was really great.  The batter was light and crispy.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"i went there when it frist opened and the food and prices were good.took my girlfriend there tonight and was very disappointed.the prices have gone up a lot and the food has gone down hill.ordered fish and chips.the fish was paper thing and mostly batter.use to always be a lot of people here but it was almost empty tonight.now i know why.there are other fish and chip place in the neighborhood that are way better and a lot cheaper.i will no be going back"}
{"text":"This is a SUPER local restaurant in East Markham that looks as though it has existed before Markham's urbanization on this side of Markham. There appears to be a few regulars that come in for food.  Walking into this restaurant, the decor is like a diner style - it states that we can have a seat wherever we want. The part that is confusing is if we have to walk up to get our own food, or if someone comes to bring us the menu. Turns out we can sit down anywhere and someone comes to serve us.   We came here for dinner, though I believe the lunch and breakfast deals may be a bit better. Halibut House is ran by Asian people - something that is unusual for a Fish and Chips Place (it makes me want to learn more about them!), but nevertheless we got to try it!  The menu isn't extravagant - it was a one page back and front menu with Fish and Chips and their main sellers. You were able to choose the type of fish - cod or haddock are the same price, and halibut options are about $10 more per meal.   For their dinner menu, we tried their 2 Orders Fish and 1 Chips for $22.95. This came with two pieces of halibut fish with lots of fries and coleslaw. I'm never sure what fish I'm eating, but when I cut into it, it was definitely a piece of fish - not a filet that some places try to scam you with. The fish was moderately soft, though it wasn't EXTREMELY special for me - but then again, I'm comparing it to THE BEST place for Fish and Chips I've ever had - which is in Gibraltar, located right next to the ocean.   Secondly, we got their Chicken Souvlaki on a pita with greek salad ($12.95). The garden salad wasn't impressive to me. It comprise of large pieces of lettuce, tomatoes and onions cut into it - and yes - don't forget the cheese that's sprinkled on top. The onions were cut really large. What I did appreciate though, was the sauce they left on the side - it was really thoughtful in case some people didn't want as much sauce on it. The Chicken Souvlaki was mediocre - nothing extremely special to me.  Whenever I drive by, I see that they have a $3.95 breakfast deal - maybe I'll come check it out next time!"}
{"text":"this is a great fish and chips place and they have long hours for breakfast as it is until 2 pm the breakfast here is affordable and delicious. most of them include eggs , bread, potato squares and a meat  the fish and chips are amazing  the batter is light, crisp and airy and  the fish has great taste and is soft and flakey. it melts in your mouth and is awesome !!!! I would recommend to come on Sunday or Monday for the $7 haddock and chips but the signature fish halibut taste the best because the fish is more dense and flavourful  great deal and the fish you get is humongous  the fries are thick cut but a little bland however you get a large portion and you also get coleslaw which I usually don't like but this one is better then average service here is quick and nice and the decor is simple  would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips. The restaurant is nice and clean, the staff are friendly and efficient and the good is great. Big portions of fish at this location? and the fries are done to perfection. The only downside is the coleslaw because I think they should give you more than just a couple bitefuls of it."}
{"text":"The food quantity to price at Halibut House makes this very very poor value.  Very very small fish portions!!!!! The chips are not chips in the classic sense.  They are processed somewhere else, frozen, then fried in the store.  Nothing special.  Coleslaw, nothing special.  Not in house tartar.  I think the very rapid expansion of this 'chain' is showing increasing problems in quality and attention. It doesn't really feel like a family run business.  Hate the décor.  If anyone remembers H. Salt Fish and Chips,  I think Halibut House will disappear too.  We will stick with places like Harbord, John's, Kingsway (a little too snooty and pricey tho)  and a fav of ours in Shelburne Ont, Hyland Fish and chips rather than ever return here.  I think there is room for scaling up by good fish and chip businesses but not 18 stores in 15 years. Feels commoditized.  Again, fish portions are skimpy, chips are not good."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to check out this newly established fish and chips place.. I believe now there are 3 in all of Etobicoke.    Upon entering it is immaculately clean and spotless I like that.   We waited to be seated but were told to seat ourselves.  Service was prompt and they did check to see how everything was.    Ordered the usual Halibut and chips.  Fish was excellent but the fries were all the same can't complain.  Everything looked fresh and it appeared as if they change the oil frequently so that's always a plus.   Tartar sauce was a little runny i admit but tasty still.   I wouldn't consider it a go to place but it's nice nonetheless and good for the locals."}
{"text":"This has been our go to breakfast take out to bring home every Saturday morning.  Order is always ready when I get there, eggs, sausage and bacon are on point.  Potato quality and quantity of eggs sometimes can be a hit and miss but overall it's more good than bad.  I've had the fish and chips and it's pretty good, I'm Not such a big fan of the fries as it's pretty under salted and just kind of getting the feeling of quantity over quality."}
{"text":"Great fries, wow, cooked perfectly. Just had the burger which was a pattie(why not homemade?) but was still a great value at $5.95 with fries and coleslaw. Will be back for fish next week."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a special place in my heart. The deep fried part of my heart. I ordered the 2 piece cod with chips ($15.99). A massive amount of battered fish, even too great for me to finish. After enlisting my son, we managed to put a dent in this delicious meal.  I've only tried the fish (cod) and chips but the quantity and quality are very good. Definitely a good place to visit if you are looking for comfort food. The décor is not fantastic and might even detour people from visiting but I think this restaurant is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the fish and chips. It was reasonably priced and the fish tasted fresh and the fries were good too.  The day I was there, the farmers were delivering bags of potatoes.  I had the two piece halibut and fries with a small side of coleslaw. It was just perfectly cooked.. The batter was light and crispy. The batter definitely did not overtake the fish .. The fries were so fresh. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Batter is very light and fluffy despite the oiliness. Coleslaw is just right without being too creamy. The fish chowder gives you a great level of comfort.  Very relaxed and casual restaurant. It's a great place to stop by if you feel like some comfort food while still in your pj's."}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant with affordable price. Lunch special and breakfast special are worthy Staffs are friendly"}
{"text":"I don't usually go for fish and chips in Toronto since most places have thick batters but this place is amazing. Fish were amazing, fresh, cooked perfectly and batter was perfect! My friend and I had halibut and haddock and I highly recommend them both. Also, service there were very good, waitresses there were very friendly. I would say their fish and chips are the best in canada! Would absolutely go there again and recommend to friends and family.  Lastly, the fries were extordinary and store is very spacious/clean!!"}
{"text":"Halibut house is an amazing neighborhood restaurant. It just has that homey feel to it and the food is just as comforting as the entire experience.   We got their breakfast and a halibut lunch special for our brunch, and we couldn't be any more satisfied. The breakfast was only $3.49 and was incredibly worth it. I ordered a sunny side egg with bacon and there's a whole bunch of homestyle fries too. Everything was just so hot and fresh. The bacon was crisp, the sausage was meaty with a snap, and the egg was perfectly done. Combined with a hot cup of coffee and you have an amazing breakfast cheaper than McDonald's.  The fish was incredibly light and flakey without being overly oily. I'd definitely recommend the halibut over the haddock but both are really good here. The haddock has more of a chew compared to the halibut. It wasn't a large portion per se but perfectly acceptable considering the amazing price. The fries and slaw were also super tasty. They don't make their own tartar sauce here it seems but I actually do fancy the packet ones as they're extra sweet and creamy."}
{"text":"I went in during lunch hour. They were not busy and I was seated right away, I ordered promptly and was even given some water. I waited for over 20 minutes with no meal in sight and no follow up. I have never done this before but I just got up and left. I don't think they really cared much as well."}
{"text":"I'm at this plaza each Monday for appointments and decided to finally try it today. The restaurant is very clean and the server was very friendly. Ordered the Halibut and Chips lunch special and added the fish chowder for an extra dollar. The Chowder was OK, nothing special. The main plate came and there was a nice lunch sized portion of Halibut and chips with a side of coleslaw. The batter was light and crispy, and the fish was moist and tender, not overcooked. The chips were cooked perfectly and had a very nice crunch. Im not a huge fan of slaw but it was ok. The server also brought a bottle of homemade tartar sauce. This was a very nice touch! Most places just provide you 2 packets of the stuff, so I was pleasantly surprised by this and this earns extra marks in my book! I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Very good Fries, good fish, also had the pork souvlaki, not great but ok, cooked on a flat top grill, a little dry.  Good Greek salad.  Lots of feta. Glass bottled pop available, always good. Service was very good, friendly, fast.  Interior is bright, big windows.  Good price.  Will go again."}
{"text":"What a let down. I ordered souvlaki, because I had a hinkering for souvlaki and I noticed in their menu that they made it, so I gave it a try. There's not much good I can say about it except it was tough, dry and tasteless.   I'm sure they make good fish, but Greek food is something they need to avoid. The staff was quick and professional, so I didn't wait long for my food.   However, if I want Greek food, I won't be coming here."}
{"text":"We tried the haddock & fries and the halibut & fries. Both were cooked well, fries were fresh. Our kids enjoyed the tenders & fries - 1 order was enough for both to share. We've only had take-out, so I can't comment on the service, but we were treated well and take-out didn't take too long. The place was packed and seems to be every time we drive by. They have a great selection on their menu. My only issue is that i find that the oil from the fish sticks to the roof of my mouth. We've had take out at least 4 times now and only once that didn't happen. Maybe old oil when they fry the fish?"}
{"text":"Breakfast rating of Four Stars.  Good service for setting.  Food prepared fast.  Coffee is good.  Overall, a good breakfast place.  Just not the first restaurant that comes to mind in the morning.  Usually if I need something at Home Depot.    Much better than, Sunset Grill that specializes in breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here on a weekly basis for at least 4 or 5 months now.  We find the fish to be excellent. The servers are very attentive and always very quick. If you like fish and chips I consider it to be a great choice."}
{"text":"Whoa I way underestimated  what the portion size was going to be like here, naturally when you go to a place called Halibut  House what would you think I would order.?.....  Yeah so I got scallops, lol....   AND HALIBUT ,  haha had you fooled there for a sec didn't i?  So yeah the breading was sooooo  good better then most places I've been really, but wow the fries were a real pleasant  supreme in how good they were Annnnnd how much there was. By the time I was done my fish n chips I was already reaching my stomach limitations. But I powered through to the scallops and Dammmmmmmnnn they were really really good. Can't go wrong here, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awful!  Just plain awful!  The halibut was decent tasting but a little too soggy, the fries were disgusting, similar to KFC fries, the salad was definitely not fresh and to top it all off, you call yourself the \"Halibut House\" and you have tartar sauce packets!!??? What kind of fish and chips place gives out packets and pretends to be top of the line?  Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The building and staff put me off almost every time. The building looks run down - sign is still burnt from a fire that happened years ago, looks like the furniture/floors have only ever been wiped down and not actually cleaned but the kitchen looks clean. The staff is pretty rude as well, they are hard to understand but get offended if you do not know what they are saying. I would recommend this place for pick up as long as you don't mind mediocre food."}
{"text":"Glad this fish and chips chain popped up in the West end. Although I can't say I always go for fish n chips but this new gem in Oakville definitely hits the spot. As Halibut House is in a newly built plaza, you cannot complain with the exterior or the interior, everything looks new and nice. The booth set up is great especially since you can move the tables and seats around for more space.  For dinner on Sunday and Mondays, they have a haddock special which is so delicious and it is fried to perfection! I had the Halibut and which was yummy but I think I am a haddock girl...nothing wrong with Halibut but the haddock texture is my preference. The meal definitely was satisfying and we left happily and full. Lastly, I wanted to point out that the staff was great. Service from the start to ordering to getting our plates food was seamless. We were well attended to. The staff asked for feedback as well as they acknowledged that they were a new establishment.  Additional notes: If you are not into fish, not to worry! They also have various specials, including lunch and breakfast. Although, I do not remember the price of their early bird breakfast, but it is ridiculously cheap from what I recall. Oh and there is a television...you gotta come here for dinner and watch baseball or hockey right?! Another new place to try :P"}
{"text":"3 and a half actually.    First of all I'm taking away a full star for the fact that they only have packet tartar sauce - and it's the really sweet sticky one so it ruined the experience.  Seriously, how can you be a fish and chips place and only offer that stuff?   Otherwise it was pretty good, had the haddock & chips (came with coleslaw) and 9 y/o had the kids halibut & chips.  Way too many chips! Maybe give less chips and up your tartar sauce game.    The one other thing I have to comment on that lost them another 1/2 star was that the haddock, while delicious to start with, was a bit heavy and greasy as soon as the oil started to cool down.  The batter wasn't the lightest.    Overall, we'll be back, but will bring our own tartar sauce."}
{"text":"When they first opened the fish was good. In a very short time the prices went up and the quality of the meals went down. Fish n chips is very greasy.   Stay away from Halibut House. There's an excellent fish n chip place just east of this restaurant."}
{"text":"What you order for take out and dine in are extras.  When you order fish and chips for dine in its also served with coleslaw but when you order for take out you need to pay extra for coleslaw. WTF. What country do we live in. If your going to operate a business and be successful first learn the language second don't screw around and try to charge extra for something that should already come with your meal. I will never step foot into that dive ever again and the sad part that was my first time. Buh bye."}
{"text":"Just got back from halibut house made an order 2 specials poutine instead of fries. The lady tells me that they don't substitute on the special. I told the lady I always substitute the fries to a poutine and it's never a problem just an extra $2. She told me if I wanted cheese I would have to pay regular price.  From $6 to $14 over a handful of cheese?! Stupid Pirates!"}
{"text":"To say the conclusion, this place is the best fish and chips! At first, i didnt expect that much, 'cause its just not near my house...Anyway,i ordered halibut fish n chips n cakes for dessert. when I first saw the plate, I just thought they used clean oil. As soon as I bited one, i was surpried!! They were crispy, crunch, and fresh! Im a big fan of sweets so i ate their dessert too. It seemed they didn't make their desserts, but it was pretty good! I had a great time here last weekend with my friend and I'll definetely visit this place again! :)"}
{"text":"Best fish & chips in Markham $6 Sunday/Monday deal for Haddock & Chips  Nothing else compares"}
{"text":"Amazing! I ate all the food and completely forgot to take a picture but I'll be back so I'll snap a picture next time :)   Fish were very flaky and delicious and the batter was so crispy and thin! Absolutely mastered the art of fish and chips :) fries seem hand cut and thick. Very yummy!   They lose a star because this place is at the top of its fish and chips game but the coslaw needs work. Worst of all, they give you packages tar tar sauce. It's not a hard sauce to make in house, so why not make it fresh to accompany your carefully prepared fish???   I'll be back for sure though!"}
{"text":"The only place to get better seafood is the coast. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is casual and the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I tried the halibut and chips or the lunch special for $8. I think the serving is kinda okay with that price. The halibut was fresh, lightly battered. the fries was just okay, needs to be eaten right away or else it will get soggy. no homemade tartar sauce, it was in packets, not bad. I like the place, nothing fancy, a lot of tables. will definitely come back and try the haddock and their burgers."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner.   Upon entering this place, I wasn't sure if it was a sit down restaurant or an order at the counter because they had a counter with the menu above it making it look like an order at the counter.. but I think that was there for the take out? I felt a bit uneasy, but looked around and figured it should be a sit down, as others were sitting with their meals, and I didn't see any trays.  The menu itself is a bit odd. They had all of your traditional Fish & Chips options (but boo, no calimari), but also had other stuff on the back of the menu; Chicken Wings, Burgers, Souvlaki, Chicken Fingers..   We stuck to the namesake and ordered Fish & Chips. I had the Halibut with Chips and Coleslaw for $12.95. The fish was really nice, I enjoyed it a lot. But the fries could have been better. Really dry and a little mushy, didn't seem like they cut them fries on premises. The coleslaw seemed store bought too. They had an abundance of tartar sauce packets on the table, so that was appreciated. I've been to some places that only offer you 2 packs, and I have to keep asking for more.  Service wasn't bad and wasn't great either. Just so-so. I would come back here if I'm craving Fish & Chips, but wish they had better chips."}
{"text":"Not usually in this area for breakfast but was glad to see a 'chain' that I was familiar with. I wrote a review 2 days ago regarding their other location on Hwy7/Ninth specifying that the peameal bacon portion was too little. I said I'd go back, and I did.   This location on danforth is renovated. It's got a lot of the branding in the tile work on the walls and it is nice.   Grabbed a seat and ordered the two egg breakfast with home fries, regular bacon and whole wheat toast no butter. Eggs were ordered over medium.   Food arrived in a very reasonable amount of time which made me happy. I punctured the egg and out flowed the beautiful yolk. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Onto the potatoes. Crispy on the outside, nice and light on the inside is how I like my home fries. This location delivered.   Toast has no butter so I was happy.   Bacon was meh. Honestly, I think these guys need a pork consultant. There are so many different options for bacon but how they are cooking it is just not right. Maybe it's just me. I don't like my bacon well done so maybe next time I will communicate more clearly.   All in all a great experience for under $6. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to greasy spoon breakfast joint on a Saturday morning.   Usually order the 3 egg breakfast special with sausage, home fries and toast.   Price for quality is fantastic. Food tastes good. Eggs cooked properly and friendly staff.   No complaints here. Haven't had the fish and chips but have heard good things.   -------  So I deducted one star from my rating. Because of my visit today (4/22/17). Ordered the peameal bacon breakfast and I have to say I am very disappointed. Firstly the portion of the peameal is minuscule. Secondly I ordered my eggs over medium. They were served fully cooked. The restaurant was not busy and what this tells me is that there is not any quality control. I will be back but hopefully they will get it right this time."}
{"text":"I came here a few times. The halibut was pretty dry inside. 3 times in a row the fries were soggy and not hot. That's a deal breaker for me. I got curious and looked over at the kitchen area. They pre make a bunch of fries and throw them in a big grey tray. That probably explains why the fries are not hot. They've been sitting out. The service was great though, but I will not be coming back. I go to Blue Nose fish and chips across the street now. Way better fish and chips!"}
{"text":"2.99 breakfast .an egg with bacon or Ham or sausage or extra egg and tiast, Not too bad  Clean and Friday"}
{"text":"Not the best looking restaurant inside but the food is delicious. So don't take a girl here on ur first date lol. One of the best fried fish batter i've had."}
{"text":"So delicious and tasty. And the price cannot be beat. Portions are huge! Cannot stress that enough. I ordered the halibut and I love how you have the option to have both a salad AND fries. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Had no issues even though they were quite busy on a Friday evening.   I have a new go-to place in Markham!"}
{"text":"I ordered 5 piece halibut and 3 chips takeout order (the most expensive thing on the menu basically) and asked to change one of the chips to a salad and the owner uncharged me $2.00 for the salad. Seriously, don't appreciate being penny pinched on changing fries to a salad when my total order comes to over $70 after tax. Poor customer service and experience. Cheap owners."}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was pretty tasty, and the portions were pretty big. However the price was pretty high for fish and chips (like $20) and the service was beyond terrible.   When I went with my friend there were literally only 2 other groups of customers there. After the waitress brought our food she literally never came back to check on us. Both her and this other Asian lady working there were constantly checking the other tables so I have no clue why we were ignored the whole time. When we were given the bill literally no one came back with a card machine or anything for like 15 mins, so I had to go up at the counter and wait for the lady to finish chatting so that I could pay. When we left none of the people working there even acknowledged us, they just kept talking to the other customers :/"}
{"text":"They have a good lunch deal $10 for halibut and fries as opposed to about $15 per meal. The halibut was fried well and the tar tar sauce always makes a fish and chips meal delicious. The restaurant itself is classic looking - typical booths, family friendly & clean.   Good if you're craving fish and chips! The fish size was smaller in comparison to other places that I've tried which is why I knocked off 2 stars and I've also seen better deals in Ajax.   Overall good!"}
{"text":"Pretty spacious inside. I think its run by Chinese people which is weird to see since its a fish and chip joint. Got some food to go and the service was quick and friendly.   I am not really a big fan of deep fried fish but when there is a coupon for 2 meals at $10 then I won't mind going out of my way to get a deal. However, the regular price is $6 for one meal so really only saved $2.   I think the fish was cod but don't quote me on that and it came with a side of fries. The nice lady that was helping me gave me plenty of ketchup and tartar sauce. The portion of the fish was so large it protruded out of the box it was served in. The fries were also very plentiful and were the thick cut type of fries.  I also got the Halibut fish and this was $12.95 - so it cost more than the two meals I talked about earlier. The fish portion was smaller as it fit perfectly in the to go box. I think I found this fish more flakier but really I could barely tell the difference between the two fish."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this morning... Ordered the cheese omelette... What I received though was a plain omelette, with processed cheese in the middle and then folded over. It doesn't bother me that every other egg meal that probably used the same ingredients cost half the price and for 10 dollars the only difference was a slice or two of fake cheese. I think the owner, and more the chef should be EMBARRASSED to serve their customers a meal like that. I wouldn't serve that to a guest at my house, let alone charge someone for such a meal.   Having said that... The service was great, the place is very clean and I have eaten here before for the actual fish and chips and the food is good.   I just feel that you're better off taking the cheese omelette off the menu, then to serve me something like that."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips spot in Pickering. The lunch special is good value. Fish batter is crisp and fries seem hand cut. Wife had the halibut sandwich which I tasted.  Was decent. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful breakfast  The breakfast special is usually what I order when I go myself, one egg, bacon or sausage, and toast. The staff are friendly and the place is spacious and clean with big bright windows. Free wi-fi. The fish and chips are quite good, decent thickness and good crispy coating."}
{"text":"The meal here is fantastic.  I really like Halibut and it is prepares very well here as fish and chips.  Good value - Great Food!"}
{"text":"If there were half stars this would be 3.5 stars worth.   My bf and I got the take out special with 2 pieces of halibut and 1 order of fries for $21.95. It was actually a good amount of food that made us full and we're not light eaters. The fries were thick cut and the fish was meaty with a nice batter. The only downside was that the fish batter was a little bit greasy for me but it was still delicious. We got take out so I can't rate them on the service but the lady I talked to on the phone and when we picked up our food was very nice and gave us all the extra tartar sauce that we wanted (we love that stuff). Everything was piping hot and freshly made and since it's only about 5 mins away from us, we will def be back. I'll try to take pictures next time before we devour everything."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few times and thought I would give it a try and reading reviews . We ordered the takeout special of 5 halibut and 3 fries. Decent value for halibut and chips for the family. Service was decent. Had to double check order and yes she did forget something ( the gravy). I read in previous reviews that they where forgetful, so we double checked.  The food is average at best. The fish and chips did not have that jump off that old time fish places give. The batter was thick not flaky. It was not bad, Just not the up there with some really good ones I had. Would I go back. Maybe, if really had a craving and did not feel like driving to our go to place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing fish is fresh  Grease is changed on a regular  Only issue i had is asking for a tip on take out I will not tip owners of this place on a take out order ."}
{"text":"Typical fish and chip place but also has breakfast until 2 pm. The breakfast was on par with other places like coras and eggsmart. The fish was quite good. Not too much batter and there's actually fish inside. The fries are fresh cut fries from a potato which is always a good decision. Prices are typical. 15-20$ per but there are lunch specials/portions for cheaper. Clam chowder was average."}
{"text":"I would rate this place as average for the fish and chips.  Portions are small, the tartar sauce comes in a generic 'ketchup' style pack and the fries taste like they were frozen.  The halibut was tiny and after eating a single order of halibut and fries, I was still hungry.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and they get top marks.  I much prefer Bluenose which is just down the road."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  $6 A giant plate of fries and a pieces of Haddock with coleslaw every Sunday and Monday.   What more can you ask for.  I also had the best chicken fingers I ever had."}
{"text":"Pricey. Average food. Ugly decor. Friendly staff.  Little value.  Avoid the halibut.  If you like bacon you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for take out on a Friday night, and as expected it was a tad bit busy, which I didn't mind since we knew we were getting freshly fried fish & chips. Super friendly staff, and the service for takeout was SO FAST, history I think it was only about 8min !!   Even after sitting in the car for almost 10 minutes it still tasted delicious! The fish has a even costing of batter all around the fish, and they give you a ton of chips with your order.   We came here with a coupon for 2 Haddock & Chips for $12 and boy was it a good deal.  Next time, I definitely want to try the halibut & cod  and see if they just as tasty.   I would definitely reccomended trying this place out if you're in the area and are craving some fish and chips"}

{"text":"I don't know what the new owner has done to this place. Portions are smaller, I'm almost certain they tried to pass off some cheap fish as haddock the other day. It was tasteless and almost jelly like. On top of that, the Greek salad use to be absolutely amazing! Now they put this disgusting fake feta on too that had a weird artificial taste.   Why did you guys have to take over and mess up a good thing?! Smh"}
{"text":"Fish and Chips are better than average, I've been to the Newmarket store and this one, and its pretty consistent.  Good service from both stores, friendly staff.    I think there is a Sunday and Monday special. $6 Haddock and chips   Also tried breakfast here, It wasnt that bad.  Weekend Special (Sat & Sun Only)-1 Egg, 2 Strips of Bacon OR Sausage, Toast & Home Fries $3.49 I ordered Sausage to be added to my $3.49 special, and it was an extra $2.99 for 3 good sized sausages.  Next time i will try this - Grand Slam Combo - 3 Eggs, 2 Bacon, 2 Ham, 2 Sausages, Home Fries & Texas Toast  $9.95  Satisfied with service and food, will go back. :)"}
{"text":"I just called at 8:30 pm and asked how much for 3 pieces of halibut and 2 chips and it was $41.00 plus $5 for delivery. I called back and asked how much it was for just 3 pieces of halibut and she said $43.50...I asked the lady why is it more for just fish without the chips and she didn't know..I do not recommend Halibut house ! They seem to be making up prices.but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I only go on Sunday and Monday for the specials. It's good enough but not great. They need to fix the fries. They have good portions on fries but I can never finish it coz it's not that great. The people are very welcoming and friendly and willing to listen to ur comments without being defensive. I'll see u guys on Sunday or Monday but that's about it. Maybe they need add a little salt on the fries when they take em out the frier. Coz it's always about the fries."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad to see how their fish and chips were like. Suprisingly we see on the menu, halibut and onion rings so we order it. We order 1 halibut and chips and 1 halibut and onion rings. To our suprise, the onion rings were subpar but the chips were great. The halibut also tasted fresh, making us ponder where they are getting their supply of halibut.   Overall, I would recommend eating here.  The reason why it is a 4 star review and not a 5 star is because the atmosphere was a bit weird."}
{"text":"Little known fact - I worked at a fish & chips place the summer before high school and even a few summers into it. So believe me when I say I know a good piece of haddock when I see one.    Halibut House is a newly opened franchise at the Shopper's World plaza at Danforth and Vic Park. I came here with a friend at his suggestion, and to be honest, I was a little hesitant. It was a chain I had never heard of, and a quick search on Yelp yielded the Kingston Road location sitting at a measly two stars with only a couple of recommended reviews. The plaza is also not exactly a hotspot for great eats or even shopping. Plus, since when has fish and chips at places like Jack Astor's or Milestones EVER hit a home run? I was well prepared for disappointment. But stepping inside, Halibut House is a surprisingly spacious and bright resto with cozy vinyl booths. The interior is tiled blue and white, with a sort of marine theme that reminds me of First Nations art. I also thought the tiled ceiling was ingenious - even though you can see the kitchen from the dining area, the open space doesn't get smoky or greasy at all.   Onto the good stuff - we both got the haddock special, which is offered on Sundays and Mondays. Unbeatable value at $7 for a hefty filet and a huge serving of thick-cut chips with traditional oil & vinegar slaw. I actually couldn't put much of a dent in the latter, and sent my friend home with nearly a full-sized takeout container of chips. He didn't have a problem with his portion, so they were clearly pretty darn decent. The fish was flaky and perfectly fried. Malt/white vinegar/salt & pepper are table side, and the waitress brings squeeze bottles of other condiments like tartar sauce and ketchup. That's right, a SQUEEZE BOTTLE of tartar sauce. Need I say more?   Eat your heart out, Waffle House! 'Sall about that Halibut House from here on out!"}
{"text":"Went here 3-4 weeks ago and I have to say upon first impression, it is one of those cosy fish and chip diner that you take your family to on Lakeshore after a afternoon stroll. I fortunately went on a Sunday afternoon and was quickly enticed by their Sunday special. It was 3/4 packed with seniors enjoying their fish. The waitress at this location was very funny and energetic and provided comedic humour while we waited for the fish and chips. The portion was very generous and they have their house made tar tar sauce in a clear squirt bottle. I will be back when I am around that area."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! And so affordable! $13 for halibut and chips -- unlimited tartare sauce (packets). Apparently it's $9 for lunch PLUS a pop! That's insane!   Staff is so friendly and the place is clean and bright. Seat yourselves. Great for groups. Food comes quick after you order.   Get your fix if youre ever in Markham!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place solely for their Haddock & Chips special..$7 Sundays & Mondays for amazing, crispy fish and a mountain of fries... Still need to come back and try their breakfast, but as far as fish & chips go, I love the heck out of this place. Value for dollar is amazing!  Lots of room to eat in, service is friendly and prompt. I am loving it!"}
{"text":"Very typical fish and chips place.  We tried their sister location in Newmarket and it's basically the same fast serving fish and chips.  Halibut and haddock are both great.  Comes a little bit oily but hey it's fish and chips!  The service is very typical - nothing special, just quick and courteous.   Would come back once in a while."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Beaches area. On my way to and from school, I would pass by a fish and chips store. My parents would get takeout often from this restaurant. When I could afford to buy something there, I'd get chips, wrapped in newspaper.   After my grade 12, I worked there that summer. The owners liked me. They insisted that I have dinner there after work. I thought that it was weird, but I caved in. It served the best halibut and chips.   That restaurant is long gone. A few years ago, I found a similar mom-and-pop restaurant that served yummy halibut and chips. Sadly, that one folded over a year ago. A cafe now occupies that location.   Enter Halibut House. I decided to order halibut and onion rings for takeout. I think that I have found my place for halibut!  The halibut was perfect. It was flaky and tender. It's a decent size and it has a thin, crispy batter. I get tired of fries these days. I opted for onion rings. So good! The onions we're sweet and the batter was perfect.   I have a decent fish and chips place again. I will come back and give some other goodies a try.   (185)"}
{"text":"Consistent quality fish and chips without the bells and whistle of fine dining, which is why their prices are so low. Simple food, standard fare, but fish tasting fresh every time.   They have very busy take out traffic here, but you can easily find an empty booth or table with yourself to a really big group here. The ambiance dining here is very low key and simple, but sometimes that's ok too! Nothing instagram worthy, but the food is what speaks volumes here.   The batter is very light, not greasy, and thinly drenched on the fish. I've been to places where you have more breading than fish, while here you know you got a generous amount of fish and you don't need to search for it in each bite. The fries are chip truck style, so thickly cut, with a small side of coleslaw, no lemon wedges unless requested. The tartar sauce comes in packets, next to the vinegars and ketchup.   The wifi is a bit moody, sometimes I can connect, but most visits I can't. The restaurant faces hwy 7 in a quiet outdated plaza close to 9th line/Markham Stouville hospital.  Worth grabbing some take out here , you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here on the day after their \"Grand Opening\". I didn't realize it was Grand Re-Opening. Place looks nice and clean when we went in. Daughter ordered Gyro on pita with well done fries. Her gyro looked awful and the color looked mysterious. It tasted like how it looked. Awful. But, the fries were the best part of her meal. I had the Haddock with Greek salad and hubs had the Halibut with onion rings. Both were ok but I was disappointed because I was looking forward to a good fried fish and this didn't do it for me. Waitress was friendly, though. Don't think I'll be returning next time"}
{"text":"After hanging at the mall, we were looking for a fish and chips place to go to. We were stuck between Jasper's Fish and Chips and Halibut House. Jasper's had pretty good reviews. When we got to Jasper's, it was closed and the decision was made for us. Off to Halibut House we went. Upon first glance, the place was very clean and neat. We were hesitant to try this place because we read that it was only opened for over a week. I'm glad that we went here! We ordered the poutines and loved it. The gravy was nicely seasoned. We also ordered the Haddock and Chips special and cod without the fries. The fries were nice and crispy. Hubs didn't care for the coleslaw because he thought it was too vinegary but I liked it. The cod and haddock were nicely fried and crispy. The restrooms were VERY clean. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a new location and it was very busy the night (Friday) I place an order for takeout. Nevertheless, I only had a minor amount of time to wait and the staff were very nice. As for the food, I ordered 2 orders of halibut and chips and I was not disappointed. Very large portions and great service. Will order from this location again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great, nice thick bacon, eggs made well, I mean it's hard to mess up eggs but they were good. I had the grand slam. Didn't like that I had to pay for coffee with my breakfast but I'll probably return if I'm feeling like breakfast for lunch."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fish & chips in town!! This place is my favourite joint lately, nothing can compare to it now when it comes to fish & chips, I've to almost every single one in Toronto yet this new one in Pickering is beyond amazing, must try their signature Halibut!! The fish is always so fresh and has the perfect balance of batter every time and the fries is really crispy and fresh and seems like they use different oil for it, you can taste the difference right away. They have a lunch special with halibut and chip for only $8.95, since an amazing deal, you can't missed out on that! Highly recommend to all my friends and family's!! Giving them a 100 LIKES!"}
{"text":"Great launch, with Buy 1 get 1 Free Halibut and Chips on opening day.  Decided to go at 8:15pm to avoid the line-ups. Man, was I wrong. There was still line-ups!  One would expect the quality to deteriorate over time, but it didnt.  The fish was super flakey and juicy, chips were fresh and on par, and the coleslaw was the best coleslaw I've actually ever had. This place will definitely be a contender for the area.  The fact they also sell greek food is a plus, as no real options nearby,"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. It has this hole-in-the-wall feel to it that made me hope it was one of those hidden gems.  Alas, not the case. The menu was true to its name with just about every type of fried fish or seafood you could think of plus a couple of appetizers, like fried zucchini.   Anyway, the batter itself was ok but what I didn't like was the over-used taste of the oil and the lack of flavor in the fish itself. I am all for re-using oil but it had a stale taste that was just unpleasant especially the more you ate it.   The zucchini and the fries were good enough but they were also over soaked in this over-used oil so they weren't a pleasant experience. I grew up in Georgia and I definitely  understand that the key to delicious fried food is one part batter and one part oil. This place was lacking on both accounts.   The reason it gets three stars is because the price was good, the service was great, and the menu was large. I wouldn't recommend you drive to this location but it's good enough for a quick meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"so i live nearby and have drove by many times but never bothered trying it out until yesterday. i read some of these other reviews down here and they were good enough to convince me to try it.  this has nothing to do with the food, but the service was good and quick which is always a pleasant thing.  I ordered halibut and fries for take out. They gave A LOT of fries and a fillet of halibut. the fries were not too bad at all. i poured on some malt vinegar and had some ketchup with that. however, as i was eating the fries, the more i ate, the more pasty/starchy my mouth started getting so i didn't even finish my fries. The halibut however, was quite good. tartar sauce came in packets which i always wants to see a fish and chips place make their own tartar sauce but this is apparently the norm. the halibut was not dry at all. the batter was not thick and was not dripping in oil. so the halibut, really good. the fries. i could do without.  i would come back to try the other menu items as well since i live so close, but for halibut and fries, i'll have to travel another 10 minutes or so west to get my fix."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, ordered the Halibut & Chips with coleslaw. The piece of halibut was a decent size. The fish batter was meh...nothing great, was not crispy at all and it was a little undercooked. They use old oil to cook the fish as it came was brown, not at all golden and crispy batter as the pictures are. The fish itself had a a fishy taste to it because it was not cooked long enough. The coleslaw was dry, not much vinegar dressing on it at all and had no taste. The fries were OK, not at all crispy, they were very thick and mushy when you chewed it. They must use cold storage potatoes because they tasteless and the potatoes must have been old, not fresh potatoes and not crispy. Cost for the meal was $ 18.00 bucks plus tip. I learned that Halibut House is an American chain and I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, you can tell that the quality and taste is just not there. Kingsway Fish and Chips on Bloor St. is much much better if your craving good fish and chips. Would I be going back, no."}
{"text":"Great value for money... Especially the $7 Sunday/Monday special for haddock & chips! Lots of food and very good fries. Decor is pretty minimalistic - not your typical wood panel red carpet fish and chips place, but the food is what matters most! The halibut was very good too (better imo) and I would definitely go back if in the area. The biggest downside had to be the packaged tartar sauce... Looks (I.e. As in the restaurant's image) and tastes way better... And costs less too! Just that small change would probably have brought it up to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Fish - Both haddock and halibut were great!  Light batter, not greasy, large and flaky pieces of fish.  Halibut is the real winner as it was silky smooth with a very nice sweetness to the meat.  2. Atmosphere - Honestly not much to write home about but that's kind of why I like it.  Ample dining area with lots of booths.  Dated decor and it has that small town feel to it - like you're on a road trip.  Fits perfectly with a no frills fish and chips joint.  Neutral: 1. Chips - Fries were pretty standard and could be improved.  2. Tartar sauce - Another area that can be improved.  Instead of prepackaged sauce (too sweet), homemade would take this place to another level.  Bad: 1. Garlic bread - The item itself was good but not $5 good for the small portion.  Main St. Greek gives this for free.  Worth it? I don't normally go to fish and chip places so I'm not sure if the prices are decent or not but the food is solid and is one of the better fish and chip places me and my wife have been to.  We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Everything was hot & fresh. Great halibut & chips lunch special $10.95. Good kids special too. We would come again."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick take out order. Ordered the halibut fish & chips combo. The service was great, everyone was friendly and I was in and out relatively quick.   Now in terms of the food itself, the fish was mediocre at best, the fries on the other hand were horrible! They tasted like burnt paper mixed in with old oil, just a horrible overall taste.  I'd say skip this one and try another fish & chips joint."}
{"text":"My favourite fish n chips place! They have a special on Mondays ($7 for fish n chips) which is why I exclusively only come here on Mondays. Such a good price for good quality fish at a good portion size. The batter is always light, crisp, and not too oily. The fish inside is always perfectly done - soft and flakey. I do wish the fries were a bit more salted but it's nbd.   The restaurant itself is not the most aesthetically pleasing since it's cheap eats but it has a nice home-y vibe.   Would definitely frequent this place more often if I lived closer to the area!"}
{"text":"If you love fish and chips then this is the place to be.  They have other selections too like breakfast items. Souvlaki and wings.  They have a breakfast special is only 3.49 which is cheaper than having a breakfast combo at McDonald's.  Also the staff is super nice especially mehgan.  She is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times already. Favourite fish n chips place! Fast, friendly service every time and the owner is super nice. If you like soft and moist fish, the haddock or cod are excellent choices. The halibut is good too if you like a firmer fish. The fries are freshly cut, but I'd suggest asking them to make it crispier if you like it that way."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order and it was ready but still hot when we went to pick it up. I ordered the cod special that included 2 pieces of cod and 1 order of fries. The fish was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries were meh. The service was speedy but cold and unwelcoming. I would go back because the fish was great and its quite close to me and I'd like to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips. The fish are soft and juicy inside, light and crispy outside. Unlimited tartar sauce, not like some places where they charge you for more.  The restaurant is nice and tidy. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place however the tartar sauce was packaged which is kind of crazy for an authentic fish and shops place. The service is mediocre not the best but ok. It seems like they're nicer to people who spend more money there. Fries were decent for onion rings were ok but their batter is greasy for all 3."}
{"text":"They had a Monday special of fish and chips for around $7 which i couldn't say no to.  The fish was huge which was great because it also became my lunch the next day.  It tasted good.  The batter wasn't heavy or too greasy.  There were lots of fries too, but they did not taste fresh.  Service was pretty fast and impersonal... kind of reminding me of McDonald cashiers."}
{"text":"Not the worst but pretty bad... the fish was bland and the quality of ingredients was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good fish and chips place.  it is not yet LLBO licenced as they are still waiting for their permit to be approved as they only opened a few months ago.  The fish is excellent.  The batter isn't too thick and the fish is cooked just perfectly every time.  The fries are fantastic.  The staff are very efficient and the food comes quickly.  There is ample seating space.  They do a very brisk take out business here but the wait staff do an excellent job of balancing their responsibilities so you aren't left wanting for service. The menu has recently been expanded to include other standard pub fare such as burgers.  My last time there I had the special which included a big piece of halibut, several shrimp and scallops, fries and a large salad.  I'm a pretty big guy but I couldn't finish it all. The only thing I've had that I don't care for is their garlic bread with cheese. Not good."}
{"text":"not what I expected, would be what came to mind.  this location is in the same plaza as a club in the basement, a sex novelty shop, and a pizza pizza...so you can get some food before some fun? I was very excited to finally come to try this establishment out, anticipation got the better of me, as the signs for this restaurant came to be about 2 months ahead of the actual opening day. so every night when I would come home from work all that went through my head would be...I wonder when this place is going to open. finally just after new years day, a posting was in the window saying \"January 10th, walk in special buy two pay for one\", welp, missed the day, but was able to come 2 days after the opening. the location is very clean at it is brand new, and you could tell that the staff was super excited and eager to help. I couldn't help but notice the small offerings available with the selection of seafood's, but then the various options or combinations of food available after a base meal? so for example you had.  fish by itself  fish with fries  fish with salad fish with salad and fries it was a tiny bit confusing to find out which selection fit my hunger at that moment. placed the order and was told  it would be a ten minute wait, which I was cool with as I like my food cooked. had a seat on the waiting bench and just watched the whole ten minutes pass by, there is an audible dinging that happens every once in a while that is slightly confusing and frustrating all at the same time. one of the fridges had absolutely no beverages in it, and the tables all had markings on the side which came across like it was bought second hand? upon receiving an announcement that the food was ready, I had a look into my bag to make sure everything was there which was promptly met with \"its all in the bag! no need to look!!!\" I had a nice little laugh over that, also requested more malt vinegar\ketchup\other stuff and that was met with \"oh but we put lots in the bag\" I was starving at this point so I wasn't terribly focused on retorting. got the food home and what I can say is this.   the actual seafood (fish and scallops) are awesome, lightly battered, very fresh and flavorful. dare I say clean as well.   the chips, not so great, you can tell that its frozen and not fresh chips, the consistency is way off from what fresh cut chips feel and taste like.  the gravy is decent, in every shape and form, even though it feels like a stock gravy.   the battered mushrooms were a great idea, but with a big of a sign as the restaurant has promoting them, it should serve as a warning \"hey! don't eat these\" it really does taste horrible.  a couple of inconsistencies(when comparing to order fish locations) no lemon? no coleslaw? no seafood\cocktail sauce??!!   after months of anticipation I was very much so let down, yes it is definitely a seafood place, but not much else, wasn't impressed with the attitude either, I know its a bit of a drive but there are other options not even five minutes away, and if you walked, I would recommend pizza pizza.   transit options are the 501, and the plaza has a dedicated parking lot which is free all day, but a tiny bit of a nightmare to deal with."}
