{"text":"Wonderful coffee shop across from a wonderful park, which happens to be one block away from a wonderful bar (Le Lab). Delicious vegan brownies and banana bread kept us frequenting this place throughout our visit, sometimes a couple times in a single day. (None of us are vegan. It's just that their vegan offerings are amazing.) Friendly service as well. We were even tempted to get unnecessary haircuts simply because we loved the place."}
{"text":"Hidden concept store with coffee / plants & hair cut. Perfect to work in front of the Rachel cycling lane or get a coffee on the way."}
{"text":"4 en 1 !! Commerce multi service : petite restauration, creme glac√©, fleuriste et salon coiffure en arriere. Service gentil, tres propre, terrasse disponible."}
