{"text":"Great food, great price (student here). I've had almost everything on the menu and I enjoyed all of it. Wonderful staff! I usually get takeout but have also eaten in the restaurant. Unpretentious and friendly place. Have gone a lot and will go again. Cash only."}
{"text":"The curry in this place is way too spicy, and too hot. The selection is quite small and rather expensive for the price you pay for. The butter chicken was not the red creamy curry I've had in other places, and I suspect that all the curry came fron the same yellow base, lacking the richness. If you just want some cheap indian takeout, come here, but don't expect any authenticity."}
{"text":"Namaste Montreal - a tiny, unpretentious Indian restaurant and take-away joint - opened its doors two months ago in the McGill Ghetto, directly across the street from local favourite Amelios.  Featuring only 3-4 tables, counter service, and a small menu, Namaste is nonetheless quickly taking on the proud sheen of a popular neighbourhood gem. On a snowy Wednesday evening around 8:30 PM, a steady stream of both eat-in and take-away customers moved through the small space - with plenty of curious passers-by taking a moment to read the menu in the window. This menu is complemented by tasty daily specials. At the time of our visit, Namaste was already sold out of several popular menu items - like lentil dishes and the lamb curry.  We ordered a samosa, a large butter chicken combo, and a thali plate with chana masala curry and chicken curry. Both plates were served piping hot, with delicious naan, rice, and fresh (although limited) salad. You can choose your level of spice - \"mild, medium, very spicy\" - and dress up your meal with homemade chutney and pickle offerings. The food was quite flavourful and was excellent value, with the thali plate costing $8.99 and the butter chicken combo only $7.99.   The service is very friendly and attentive, and the overall experience is like eating in someone's kitchen. That being said, given the small space and the serving of even eat-in meals in large styrofoam trays, Namaste is strong on a delicious take-out experience. It's a welcome addition to a neighbourhood that's been lacking in very good, inexpensive Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome, home-made style indian cuisine.  The owner is always on premises and super-friendly."}
{"text":"I'm an Indian person and this reminds me of the food that my mother (and I) make ourselves -- in a good way. I ordered the chicken masala and it was quite excellent; my only nit-pick is that this was made with boneless breast meat, while I've typically seen it made with bone-in dark meat chicken, which gives the masala a richer flavor (from the gelatin and marrow in the bones). But the breast meat was very tender and the rasa (sauce) was terrific. We also ordered the vegetarian thali, which was also very good. The shahi paneer and channa masala in the thali were both very tasty. The only other small negative is that the naan, while tasty, wasn't freshly made.  I understand that they're opening a sister restaurant that's slightly bigger called Peg-n-Tikka (or something like that). The bigger size would be welcomed, as Namaste is very tiny.  One other note: my 4 stars are typically the same as most people's 5 stars, so that's not a knock on this restaurant at all. I'm just a pickier grader. :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing especially there naan and shahi paneer  the place is very small though its probably good to take out your food rather than eating there."}
{"text":"Cheap, yes. Take-out, yes. Both assets in a student neighborhood. But this place falls down on quality of food. Samosa was cold, naan unrecognizeable. Buttery chicken, blah. Mango lassi gets high marks. Otherwise, find another cheap place that does take-out."}
{"text":"delicious food, fantastic ambience and top notch sophisticated service."}
{"text":"There are extremely few restaurants in McGill ghetto that are not on St. Laurent.   Its cheap + independent and has a little-guy feel  The food is totally decent cafeteria style indian, not too greasy   very small dining room  Some might be put off by the kitchen, which you can kind of see from dining room.  I'm not that squeamish but some of my dinner companions felt weird about the level of cleanliness in the place.   I would most likely go back."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité vs prix! Poulet délicieux et bien épicé à souhait.   Un take-out très satisfaisant, lorsque vous avez envie d'une bonne bouffe indienne express. C'est le meilleur dans McGill Ghetto.   Chaque fois que je passe devant le restaurant, j'aurais envie d'en manger tous les jours. Pain naan bien chaud et riz basmati délicieux pour accompagner le tout.  Je vous recommande surtout le poulet beurre indien.  N.B.: il n'y a pas de machine interac. Il faut payer en argent comptant."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place while searching out an available BIXI on Milton.  Since it is close to my work, I have the opportunity to stop by on my way home for a tasty samosa snack.  I have done that several days in a row and today I finally hit up the spot for a full lunch with a colleague.  Oh my, butter chicken goodness!  Naan, rice, butter chicken and a mango lassi to drink for 12$ and my friend had a vegetarian combo for 11$ (with mango lassi).  I will definitely go back for delicious and affordable Indian food!  Super friendly service too."}
{"text":"Super delicious !  Simple decor, but I like what they hang on the wall, and they have a recycling book system - give a book and take a book, which was pretty cool  The owner is super nice and the food is delicious. Large portions and I really really liked the naan. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great food and great service . If you like laid back environment , this is for you ... Would recommend to everyone . The butter chicken was delicious ."}
{"text":"Picked up two curry sets here on a suddenly-chilly day in the late spring: stellar comfort food at a good price. As an added plus, the samosa here are mad good, and Namaste's now my official \"I need something deep fried, and I need it now\" stopover for it."}
{"text":"I think this is the most unpretentious nice indian restaurant. Lots of Mc Gill student  go to this place  for take out food, because the place is pretty small ( 2 little table). But the food is excellent and it's pretty cheap like 10-12$ for a plate and a soft drink but who cares if the food is good.   I ordered a veggie plate with eggplants and it was delicious. It's good if you want to have delicious indians take out food. We ate there ( we were 4) but it's very small.  Anyway just order take out food you'll be surprise of the quality !   C'est je pense le restaurant indien le plus simple à Montréal. Beaucoup d'étudiants de Mc Gill vont chercher des commandes pour emporter, car c'est très petit ( seulement 2 tables disponibles). Mais la nourriture est vraiment excellente and très abordable ( 10-12 $ pour une assiette et une liqueur !).  J'ai commandé un assiette végétarienne à base d'aubergines et c'était très bon. C'est excellent pour des plats à emporter car il font d'excellent mets indiens ! Nous avons mangé à une table mais c'est très petit et très simple.  Essayer de prendre un plat pour emporter vous serez surpris de l'accueil très amical       des employés et de la qualité des mets !"}
{"text":"I called to order before I went there because of other Yelp reviews. This place is not far from my home so I thought pickup was fine too. I ordered a butter chicken meal and it turned out very good! I enjoyed the strong flavor and their naans are so good!!! Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Super tasty food! Best Indian I had in Montreal! Make sure to try their dessert too!! :)"}
{"text":"the food was really fresh and delicious. im sure. cuz i tried it in my country but its really different. and worker was so kind. if u wanna take out, call for order and take out. it should be better :)"}
{"text":"Got a butter chicken thali and a vegetarian thali. This was my first dining experience in Montréal and the best part was the strong sense of feeling welcomed in a new city it gave me. The food is tasty, but simply. The decor and size is very quaint. But the clientèle is so down to earth and relaxed that it makes for a very comfortable dining experience. Did I mention that the pricing is tres reasonable? Will be back to try a lunch wrap and samosa soon."}
{"text":"you gotta love this place! it's small, it doesn't look special or anything, but the food is phenomenal, pretty authentic (according to some of my indian friends i've gone with), and cheap. i went for lunch here a few weeks ago after a night of drinking, i was absolutely starving, and the butter chicken hit the spot like nothing else i could've gotten.  the people here are friendly too! they always ask if you enjoyed your meal, and seem to really care."}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken, very friendly staff. Great disvovery in the neighborhood. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is a little watery but made with good ingredients and still deliciously authentic! Good stop for good food at good price."}
{"text":"Wow ! Belle découverte:-) un dal authentique et délicieux et un poulet masala savoureux. J'y reviens, c'est certain . Parfait pour le lunch du midi. Et la musique style indi-folk juste à mon goût. Le jeune sympathique chef prends les commandes de groupe pour emporter et on peu aussi apporter notre repas take-out."}
{"text":"This was actually my first Indian food and it was delicious! I had the  Thali Chicken which consists of butter chicken, rice, Naan and cucumber tomato salad. The curry the chicken is in has the most complex flavors and it is slightly spicy which I loved, everything was fresh and so delicious. The service was very good, nice polite. Price is about 10 cad per meal very reasonable for what you receive."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best food I've ever put in my mouth. Never would have thought that such a small place could turn out world class food. I would recommend everyone try it."}
{"text":"Really nice place in the McGill Ghetto, especially during the cold months. Make sure to pickup some samosas on your way to class!"}
{"text":"Very bare, spare and to the bones decor with only 3 tables, which can seat 4 each, plastic cutlery, melamine thali plates, and the great piece de resistance,...... brown paper towels as napkins! You need to go up to the counter, order you choice of dish, wait, then pick it up at the said counter, all in the wonderful melamine plate  sitting on a brown ugly tray. Take  your plastic cutlery from the box near the cash, tear off a strip of brown paper from the roll next to the cutlery box, go to your table, and you're ready to eat. I ordered a masala chicken, not much chicken, but the naan was good and hot,  the rice was fine, but the salad was just  stewed chickpeas! I asked about that, and the gentleman behind the counter informed me that this is due to all the McGill lords and ladies not being used to Indian -style salad,  would leave it on their plates, so hence, no salad. Boo Hoo! They got tired of wasting all the uneaten food. He did inform that they will experiment with a salad more suited to the western palate, I do hope so , as I LOVE salad, any style! They are  only open at certain hours,and days,  so best to check BEFORE going, and make sure to arrive before the rush, as obviously, due to space, or lack of, it fills up FAST. If you're the take out type, this is better suited then; prices are reasonable for the downtown/plateau area and you're given a\"points\" card after your first order.  Collect a full card of \"points\" and get a freebie."}
{"text":"Average fare at high price. Samosa was cold. Curry was okay and naans were store bought. Not worth the price in my opinion.."}
{"text":"I don't have enough stars available for this place. We found namaste cafe by chance. This place is simply awesome, the food is homemade and the energy is postive and very contagious. Kapil the guy who runs the place is generous and kind. I hope this place does well. Eating here was one of the best experiences in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you are nearby, you should definitely try this place. Price, quality, quantiy wise all 5 atars. The owner is a student at mcgill who seems down to earth."}
{"text":"The menu is as small as the location but it's perfect for an informal meal or take-out. We went after hitting the Botanical Garden hard for most of the day and needing an unfussy meal to eat, Big Bang Theory-style, around the hotel sofa while we put our feet up. (My sister-in-law bagged Sheldon's spot.)   The chicken and vegetarian dishes were both excellent, and the naan bread especially so. Welcoming, counter-style service, no wifi (talking to each other when eating in the restaurant is, instead, encouraged) and no credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"A really cute and inexpensive stop for a quick meal - while it wasn't the best Indian I've ever had, it certainly was worth the low price point."}
{"text":"This was my go to for takeout in the ghetto. It's quick, affordable, delicious, and a pretty healthy option. Staff have always been friendly and they prepare the food quickly."}
{"text":"As an ethnic not-Indian-in-any-way, I may not be qualified to give a fully-encompassing review of Indian cuisine, but I know what I like.  Over the past two years I've been on a journey trying to explore all the best Indian eateries Montreal has to offer, and contrary to some of the previous reviews, this place is not it, in my opinion.  I ordered the Vegetarian Thali which comes with a choice of 2 curries; I chose Shahi Paneer (cheese in cream sauce) and Daal (lentils), and I asked for no rice or salad so they gave me an extra naan.  Shahi Paneer is my guilty pleasure when it comes to Indian food; it's basically Indian cottage cheese (paneer) cut into cubes, cooked in a cream sauce (usually the butter chicken sauce) (shahi).  Yummm!  Daal is lentils cooked in onions, ginger, garlic, and tomato curry.  I'm not a super lentil lover, but I like to try to have at least a few vegetables :-P.  Usually I get my balance of rich, creamy, delicious Shahi Paneer, and more savoury, healthy Daal.  Unfortunately, this time I was disappointed by both.  The Daal was spicy but not overly so, so far so good, but there was no real substance to the flavour.  The texture reminded me of over-boiled vegetables, just mushy and tasteless.  The Shahi Paneer, on the other hand, had none of the creaminess I've come to expect, and instead reminded me of the texture of ketchup.  I was really glad I didn't go for the rice and salad after this, and was looking forward to the naan, but as soon as I saw it, warning bells started going off in my head.  I'm guessing due to the cramped quarters, they don't have room for a real tandoor oven.  The naan was really thin, and had a bad taste of oil that I've had before with store bought naan.  I'm pretty sure it was warmed up on a pan.  I finished with some Kulfi for dessert, this was also store bought, but at least the quality was decent.  The price of the entire meal was $13, which is perfectly reasonable, but I can say I've had far superior meals at other Indian restaurants for the same price.  Namasté looks cozy, but also quite cramped, and I really enjoyed the decor, but sadly the gustatory experience left me wanting.  I'm rounding up 2.5 stars to 3, because it wasn't *bad*, just disappointing."}
{"text":"The moment you walk into Namaste Montreal you're enveloped in a warm rich smell that blows you away.   After 3 years in Montreal eating very average Indian food I was delighted to try out Namaste! Their food is perfectly spiced but not spicy and absolutely not oily. The value of their meals makes this place a real winner. I got a plate with daal (lentils), sabji (vegetables), naan and rice for $10!   Namaste is a real keeper. My advice is call in advance and do a pick up if you're in a larger group or sit in and enjoy some bollywood beats, solo or with a buddy.   Tip: order the mango lassi to temper the well spiced Indian meal."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 starts simply because it's just straight up good. The place isn't meant to be a large fast food or fancy date night type of spot. It has 3 tables and has a cozy vibe to it. Enough options to please everyone. My ultimate favorite is the vegetarian Thali which also comes in non-dairy, since I'm intolerant to lactose. :)) The gentleman who served me was very polite and took the time to ask me how the meal was. Super affordable and two blocks from home. Most importantly, place is clean. No need to spend too much for a quick hearty meal. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had heard about this place from friends. Came for a quick lunch one freezing Friday and we were greeted by a smile and great service. Food was awesome and we had the pleasure of tasting the spiciness before selecting our dish as it was very quiet before lunch rush. It will be our \"go-to\" Indian place in central Montreal now.  Tip:   If you are expecting lavish surrounds this is not for you. It is rustic and homely and \"rough-and-ready\" but I have no problem with this when the focus is on the food"}
{"text":"Meilleure soupe dhal à vie!!! Intime, sans prétention. Aliments frais, prix plus qu'abordable. J'adoooooore!"}
{"text":"This place offers authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. In fact, food here is better and cheaper than anywhere in the neighborhood. A great and cozy place to enjoy a nice meal.  Plus point: The owner/manager (his name is Kapil) is a very friendly guy and would always improvise the food to suit your taste."}
{"text":"Such a convenient, cute and affordable Indian place! The owners are so nice, and the food is authentic and so so fresh!! On weekdays, I recommend their naan samosa wrap for lunch (a samosa wrapped in naan bread with veggies - YUM!!) Only downside is they only take cash :("}
{"text":"The chicken butter Thali was really good, the staff  friendly and the gulab jamun an excellent desert. Yet simple and small the restaurant is rather charming with a nice and cosy atmosphere.  Go there, it's worth trying it ;)"}
