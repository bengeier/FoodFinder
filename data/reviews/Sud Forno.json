{"text":"The pastries are great(cannoli, canoncini, bombolone) and the pizza by the slice is very good. Can easily have a nice quick meal here for under 15$. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Favourite place!!! no bullshit, all the cakes and sandwiches are amazing, and their whole whey bread is the best i ever had, now have to eat them every single morning.

The girls work in day shit are kinds of bitch... love the ppl who works in the night, always give me half price off if I go there before they close."}
{"text":"Had seen this place before but didn't realize it is operated by Terroni until a friend mentioned it. I have been impressed by the restaurant before so I figure its bakery / cafe must also be top notch; but boy, how sorely disappointed was I?

We ordered some dessert goods and pizza, which the latter was delicious; the desserts were nothing spectacular. What upset me most were the complete lack of professionalism and poor customer service my friends and I experienced. The day we visited not all items had labels in front of them so as my friend kindly asked the employee at register to help, it appeared as if we were wasting his time and he was reluctant to slide to the bakery side to help. He seemed disinterested in describing any of the items or generally helping at all. The final straw for me was the fake half smile, the kind of smile that servers provide as they interact with customers but as soon as they think customers are not looking, they immediately look disengaged. For that gentleman, it was more of a disgruntled look than anything else. 

Terroni offers such amazing service and to be treated so poorly in its sister cafe, it was shocking and frankly, a huge shame. I will never step foot again in Sud Forno."}
{"text":"Im gonna try and be fair and square. Starting from the positive: the atmosphere is cozy and nice. The music is not too loud. Im thinking you can potentially meet people here. 
Now the bad and the ugly: the bad is the fact that the coffee is not special at all, i can fix myself something way nicer at home. As for the ugly, i ordered beigenets for desert and when they were brought over to my table, one glance at the horrendous sight of the amount of sugar they had drizzled on top of the little balls made me want to return them instantly. However, I decided to be a good sport and try them and I can honestly say Tim Horton's has done a much better job with their Tim bits. Not likely to come back here again."}
{"text":"Great place that stands out on Queen st.....sweets, coffee, bread, pizza ...just like nonna used to make...amazing"}
{"text":"From a quick peek inside earlier this afternoon, my partner and I were delighted to discover that tonight was the opening of the location on 132 Yonge Street.  It was not our intent to return; as we are in Toronto only for a few nights.  However, upon later discussion of how impressed we were with the design and vibe of the space, we decided to give it a try for dinner.  While it was well understood that this was this location's opening night, the service, food, and overall experience simply underwhelmed; motivating my desire to offer this review.  The specifics:

Service:   Our waiter, Ricky, was efficient and not very engaging, especially with this being the opening night.  In particular, descriptions of menu items by Ricky were lacking and little was done to make for a dining EXPERIENCE that would warrant a return.  We also noted an abundance of staff and management on hand with little of their attention and time allocated to diners; especially, those of us, seemingly, not known.

Food:  An appropriately executed and presented sea bass dish, Branzino, and adequate pizza, N'Dujana, made for a decent meal; however, so not worthy of the price.  An antipasto, the \"U Pesce Frit\", as presented, were not well thought out or executed.  Problems with preparation and presentation were evident.  The kitchen seemed especially challenged with seasoning (the antipasto - under seasoned; with the sea bass - slightly over seasoned and salty) and \"harmonizing\" a plate (i.e. dish components not coming together in a cohesive manner - e.g. the potatoes with the sea bass were beyond a disappointment).    

Overall Experience:  Again, we were so underwhelmed.  This is your opening night and opportunity to, simply, WOW.  No aspects of the evening created a WOW moment.  
Throughout our meal, I was so frank and candid with our server about hits and misses and little was done to either correct or compensate for misses.  In essence, with expectations of a great experience, we walked away with an overall sense of complacency.  I am sure that this was not the intent of the night."}
{"text":"What I bought and tried yesterday was very tasty mostly because of the admittedly fantastic bread that was used for this sandwich called \"The Stracciatella\". As far as the products go you've come to the right place, but the customer service ....... Here's why I will easily resist the temptation to return. 

The manager (I presume he was) had just given someone instructions on cleaning the entrance and then left soon after I entered the bakery. It was striking how many people were standing behind the counter, but they seemed friendly enough. Only one of them finally ended up showing she was capable of handling customers. The same cannot be said for the brunette woman - not young not old - nor the young man behind the counter and definitely not the ill-mannered aggressive young woman (blond with wavy long hair in a bun). My question whether the sliced meat in the sandwiches was cruelty-free or not was met with eye-rolling. That's when one of them peeled away and decided it was best to disappear. The young man actually got on the phone (not sure calling whom for information), which I told them was not necessary guessing that it might take longer and that it was probably good charcuterie, but essentially from mass-farmed animals. He insisted to stay on the phone. In the meantime, I found a good vegetarian option with the help of the only decent employee in the bakery. After a long time, the young man gets off the phone to let me know it's \"Italian Prosciutto\". I thanked him and jokingly said hat we still didn't know anything about the origin of the meat, so therefore I would just go with another very tasty looking vegetarian sandwich. After all, he had tried to help. 
I thought that part of the conversation was concluded and on top I was now talking to the only nice young woman who was helping me with the vegetarian sandwich. Well, for some reason this young man decides to say out loudly that he doesn't think anyway such meat exists. I do consider this common knowledge. All sorts of good restaurants pride themselves with seed to sausage practice and buying their meats from farms that operate strictly cruelty-free like Beretta Farms. Their hot dog sausages and deli meats are sold at Whole Foods for anyone who's interested. Independently of the fact that this can be considered common knowledge for someone who works in the food industry in a cosmopolitan city like Toronto I was shocked to hear when he started a little sarcastic conversation with the female colleague behind the cash register. While this rather unappetizing young woman keeps staring at me she jumps in to ape my words and mock me with her colleague. A little back-and-forth ensues about cruelty-free and what a cruel world it is and all sorts of garbage really. I finally decide to challenge her.  At this point, her male colleague decides to stop with the sarcastic comments said out loud into the bakery. She goes on with a smirk to hurl a self-righteous \"I'm a vegetarian!\" at me. Firstly, in China a sack of rice just fell over. Secondly, I am not helped, but on top of that mocked and then guilted by the staff? She would have tried to bully me, which by the way I would not have stood for, but her manager came back in. I don't like dramatic scenes and on top of that it was my birthday. Would it have been worth the headache to try and prove a point to an ignoramus? 

However, I do hope that the manager of \"SUD\" realizes the powerful potential of sites like these. There is a lot of room for improvement here and perhaps if he reads the comments here including those that speak to an existing problem of poor customer service among his staff he may decide it's time to sit these creatures down for a performance evaluation. As courteous customers willing to pay for their product our happiness in his bakery should matter to him. I'll say it once more: Their breads are out of this world, but my values are important to me, so I have no trouble resisting the temptation to ever go back in there. A lot of customers like me will matter."}
{"text":"Wheat belly diet followers are sure to fall off the wagon at this fantastic bakery. Watch the bakers bring goods out from the kitchen and do your best to not be mesmerized by the sight and smell of the great selection - breads, deserts, sandwiches, pastries, gelato...One of the best bakeries in the City."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday brunch here recently. Spacious and comfortable spot with elevator access to upstairs where brunch is served. It seems to be a popular spot for families as most tables near us were full families with kids and relatives. 

My friend and I ordered one of the brunch sandwiches that had a sausage patty and rapini and side salad. It was a very generous serving and tasted decent. 
Liked but not loved, so probably not returning just yet."}
{"text":"The gelato dissolves in you mouth before it even touches your throat. The flavours are suttle, and not to sweet, adding a rare kind of depth to the pastry. Will be back, with friends
!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite pizza and gelato place. However it's very chaotic in there on the weekend. Their sourdough breads are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Unique and amazing place. We sat at the bar and, on this particular day and time, as long as you are ordering alcohol you received a platter of appetizer tastings for free. There is an Italian market in the back of the room to peruse and purchase snacks to bring back to the bar if you wish. Great unique wine menu and a make-your-own gin and tonic menu. I ordered the dillons rose gin, q cucumber tonic, and basil garnish... best gin and tonic I've ever had. We purchased the potato and octopus cold salad to try and the Caprese salad, which were both delicious. 
The bartenders were a bit slow and the bar wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"I've been here before for a slice of pie but on a rainy afternoon I was after a bowl of soup and decided to check and see if SUD had anything warm to offer. While the soup was good and the vegetable offering was just the dose of greens my day had been void of, it wasn't hot enough and was quite a small portion for the price. The bread that came with the soup, while it didn't look like anything special was excellent (as it should be- this is an Italian bakery after all) and a great welcome to my healthy soup. I also purchased two small biscotti and my meal came to $10.31 without a drink. A little steep but what you come to expect at this Terroini owned spot."}
{"text":"Truly excellent food, fine service, homemade desserts, homemade sandwiches, and gorgeous bar seats looking over Queen St. W. I eat here for lunch all the time for about $10 including a sandwich, espresso, and dessert. Truly yummy."}
{"text":"Love the coffee, bomboloni and service.."}
{"text":"Sud Forno has good pizza and good desserts. But for me they are only \"good.\" Coupled with the fact that I never get a warm feeling from any of the employees, I would never go out of my way to go here or recommend this spot to any of my friends. Not only do they give a cold vibe, but they also do not seem to be very knowledgeable about the product they are selling. I have been here a couple of time since they opened because they are so close to the park, which I frequent. Each time I am hoping that something will change because they WERE brand new workers at a new cafe but sadly things remain the same.  I hope the people that work behind the counter realize that they are a reflection of the owners/management/product and begin to value their customers. They never seem genuinely happy to be gaining your business and with other cafes like Nadege close by they should realize there is some steep competition."}
{"text":"Visited Sud Forno during a birthday trip to Toronto. It was recommended to us, and we followed the recommendation to try the Nutella bombolone, which was excellent - and I'm not even really a doughnut person. We also enjoyed some pizza and the interesting ambience of the upstairs seating area, with its big communal table and storage of various ingredients and dry goods around."}
{"text":"Delicious canoli and bombaloni. There's always a lovely buzzing artsy feeling to the communal seating area upstairs.

A must when having a day out on Queen West."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a coffee and a bombolone (Italian doughnut) from Sud! If you are a Nutella lover, the Nutella filled bombolone is to die for!

Sud is also a great place for sandwiches, pizza, gelato and Italian baked goods (biscotti, cannolis, etc). They have $7 lasagna on Sundays which is a great deal. 

In terms of the venue itself, there isn't much seating on the first floor but the second floor has some communal tables. The best seat in the house are the stools near front window where you can enjoy your coffee and dessert and watch the happenings in queen street."}
{"text":"spectacular sandwiches, pizza, panini, fresh baked bread, and desserts. fresh ingredients. delectable and stylish. great window-counter view of queen street. tons of room for big groups upstairs. coffee depends on who's pouring it. be sure to request the smallest cup for americano or your coffee will be drowned in hot water. counter staff are often surly and too cool for school, but fortunately it's cafeteria-style ordering so interactions are brief. if serious coffee is your primary goal, keep walking to R2 a few doors down. if not, enjoy great food and acceptable coffee in sud's trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"The same great bread you get in Terroni. The best gelato in town. Good expression, excellent pastries. A bit pricey but the products justify it"}
{"text":"If you're on Queen West and looking for some great pizza and Italian pastries, give Sud Forno a try.  I was directed there by a store owner and wished I had had a bit more time to linger and try a few sweet treats.  They also offer Campari and and Aperol to complete the Italian experience.  

Eat-in options include window seating on the main floor or a communal table upstairs where you can watch the bakers hard at work or loo out onto the street, depending on which end of the table you're sitting on."}
{"text":"Lots of personality at this place, even on a Friday night on the Labour Day LW. The margarita pizza is literally some of the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"So excited that the Yonge St location has finally opened! The location is beautiful! The first floor is \"cafeteria\" style and the upstairs is a sit down restaurant. We went in for the bombolones so we sat on the first floor. There were lots of staff members working and were super helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"All of the food is as delicious as it looks. I ordered one of the sandwiches and it was simple, fresh, and tasty. I would give it a higher star rating but other than the reasonably priced sandwiches and pizza slices, I found the desserts to be overpriced for what they were."}
{"text":"TLDR; come for their pastries, not their main courses. It's about pricey for what you get but I like the atmosphere.

Nutella bombolone - apparently the most popular pastry. Good but kind of underwhelming and expensive for the size and what it is. It's pretty much a Nutella stuffed donut that costs $3 and smaller than your standard tim hortons donut. They come in a mini size as well the size of a timbit but still costs $2.50... So obviously the regular size is a better bang for your buck 

Jam filled biscotti - this is my favourite so far. It's different from typical biscotti, not as hard. The jam is not overly sweet so it's a pleasant snack.

Jam Frangipane crostata - a bit pricey for what it is but not a bad treat. Wish it could have been warmed up a bit tough.

Antipasto Della casa - not a bad starter to share. I loved the gnocco fritto, which seems to have been subbed in for the Mozzarella. The charcuterie selection was pretty standard (salami, prosciutto and capocollo).

Farcito classico - they call this a pizza, I call this a sandwich. Literally prosciutto, Arugula, Mozzarella, and tomatoes stuffed between cold, hard pizza crust that resembled stale bread. I thought it would have been warmed somewhat but it was not.

Saccoccia - this was an interesting dish. It's pretty much a giant ravioli stuffed with burrata. The menu says it's served warm, not hot, because they don't want to melt the burrata but really it was just cold. Still enjoyable and unique though.

Astice - very pricey for the portion size in my opinion. You get one lobster claw with a small plate of pasta for $28. I did enjoy the pasta's spicy kick from the chili peppers and the strong basil taste. However when this was served, the outer layers of pasta was already room temperature/cold... 

Overall, I think I would still come here and pick up a biscotti for my coffee, but I would pass on coming to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Found it odd that they don't allow sandwiches to be warmed at request. If it's anything like Terroni's I'd imagine it's because they know how a sandwich tastes best. (*sarcasm*)

An incredibly delicious sandwich (with pretentious undertones) awaits you!"}
{"text":"This place is unspeakably beautiful - not merely nice. 

Now that the Terroni owners have achieved success it seems they can afford the pinnacle of design and cuisine. Food awesome - place great. 

BUT _ not so good if you are not of perfect health, say on crutches, a wheelchair or the like. In that case - no access which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for about 8 people for a birthday. The food was very tasty and fresh. We had different pizzas, lobster pasta, pork chops, and another pasta I can't quite remember. The pizza with prosciutto was just like any other I've had. This had gorgonzola on it which added some more flavour.
I ordered the lobster pasta, it surprised me how delicious it was on my first bite. But then my 2nd bite I realized the pasta wasn't so al dente but just not very cooked. If the pasta was cooked evenly throughout I would have given this place a 4.
For dessert we ordered the cannoli with Ricotta and butterscotch pudding I think. It was heaven in my mouth. Very light and not to sweet. 
I took a star away because of the service. It started out strong but then after we received our food our service needed to be tracked down. I asked twice to get spicy peppers which took probably 20 minutes to get. Then we had to find him to get the bills and for some reason he misunderstood and only took payment from 2 people then left for another 20 minutes where we had to ask again for the bills.
I'd probably come here again because despite the service and not so thoroughly cooked pasta, it was tasty"}
{"text":"Tried both the orange and pistachio gelato. Mmm! Friendly staff and cute little shop. Would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I have come here a few times. This weekend we asked why they don't have at least one high chair and we got a \"nobody has asked for one\" and \"it wouldn't really fit upstairs. We have managed to carry our big stroller up to the second floor countless times ( this is why we ended up asking). Basically we were brushed off, which made me feel they don't really want to make it family friendly. A staff member did come upstairs and talk to u some more and said she would follow up. 

Besides this, we do like the food, pastries and coffees. Good variety of things to choose from."}
{"text":"Randomly walked in on a Sunday afternoon. Food was pretty much as good as it gets. The pizza was crispy dough but sausy top and very thin. The croissant was just the right amount of crispy with a delicious almond with rum inside. Would always come back here for a relaxed tasty afternoon snack!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have been consistently happy every time. The food is great: quality ingredients, simple, elegant and wholesome classics. Far from bland. The pastry is also yummy! I specially love the crema bombolone :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times during the weekday. I find the staff mediocre. They don't take customers in the order that they should. I've waited long only to have staff serve the person behind me first. I find this extremely rude."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the bombolone (large: $4.75) with custard. The texture of this doughnut is lovely with the crunch of the sugar on the outside, the tender but substantial dough, and the generous amount of smooth and rich vanilla custard with a hint of lemon. It's an expensive doughnut, but I would absolutely buy it again over any Jelly Modern and some Von Doughnut doughnuts.

I also tried the Nutella bombolone, which was tasty, but not as good as the one with pastry cream. I adore Nutella, which really says something about the bombolone with custard

Only downside was when I got there, they were out of the small size of their bomboloni."}
{"text":"Had dinner on August 23, 2017.  I'd give it another 1/2 star if I could.  Overall, dinner was good.  I appreciate an al-dente, however the pasta Amatriciana was just a little TOO al-dente (almost crunchy).  I didn't send it back, but thought about doing it.  Sauce was a bit light too.  House red (Marula) is yummy.  Oh... portion size is a bit on the small side.  Two rugby-built guys left a bit hungry.  The cod appetizer was amazing!  Very good portion size.  They're 3 weeks in.  Hopefully they'll take this feedback to heart and made some adjustments.  I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Sud Forno has really amazing pastries, pizza  and coffee.
The Nutella pastry was a bit sinful but so worth the extra calories.
The Pizza squares are prefect to take to out on a picnic at Trinity Bellwoods. or alternatively 
head up  to the second floor and enjoy your  smack at the  communal table."}
{"text":"A few of us wanted to try the second floor dining room \"Da Geppetto\" given that we have always been fans of Sud Forno's desserts and snacks on the main floor. Unfortunately, we were incredibly disappointed with our entrees. Although our server was lovely and the desserts/drinks were good, the portion sizes of the main plates were ridiculously small. For a $22 plate (Ricotta Dumplings), you get 5 tiny pieces of pasta with a bit of sauce. The pasta itself was decent but served lukewarm. My other friend ordered the Casoncelli Ai Funghi Porcini and although it was tasty, there were only 7 small pieces of pasta on her plate. Would not recommend this place for dinner. For these prices, you can get a more substantial meal (same quality) at Gusto 101."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and awesome gelato! We always stop by here for a sandwich (smoked salmon!), dessert, and tea. Their pizza slices are also amazing. Can't go wrong with ordering anything from sud forno. :)"}
{"text":"Let's just say our experience was so good that the food didn't last long enough for us to take a photo. So...not sorry. We had a cream filled donut and a croissant. Both were extremely fresh and melted in your mouth. The donut was sugary coated goodness and the croissant was a flakey, buttery dream. I'll definitely be back. Multiple times. Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"I like it here! 

If you're confused by how to order like a regular, you order at the counter and/or wait in line if need be. You can pick from the desserts or prepared foods to your left, or at the back there's a delectable spread of fresh made pizza. One slice of those babies is all this girl needs to feel full, and it's particularly satisfying when it's coming fresh from the oven. The options change regularly but you'll always find a margherita, and at least one meat option and one veg option. 

Other highlights are the good coffee + espresso options, small selection of artisanal groceries, and the Italian doughnut holes. No one is mad when you show up to a party late with these guys. 

XOXO"}
{"text":"The coffee is great but slow service and you have to get and pay for your coffee at a separate station so you end up lining up twice. There are many options from pasta to pizza and salads. Also plenty of dessert options. The food looks wonderful. Great presentation. Flavour is not as great. A bean soup was bland and the eggplant parmigiana was small and overwhelmingly smokey flavoured."}
{"text":"Sud forno is trendy in every shape and form. This location is big, filled with staff running around or waiting to help you out and just overall look expensive. 

Stop by this morning for coffee and breakfast and to get some work done. Theres great space for work and its not too noisy which is great. Ordered an americano, and it was pretty decent. For the food well. I havent tried anything so i wont judge the food here, but rather my inability to purchase something that fits what i wanted. 

Something somehow healthy with protein! Thats all i wanted, i tried and couldnt find anything. I even drop the protein. Just give me something somehow healthy. I know we live in a world of eternal treats, ice cream and butter pastry covered in chocolate. But sometimes the guy need to think about his waist. So i decide to not wat anything instead. Maybe i was setting myself up for failure here. But well. Thats what it is. Start carying fruits sud forno"}
{"text":"One word bombolone. Get yourself a custard or Nutella filled Italian doughnut you'll have no regrets. There are three sizes for those that are diet conscious or on a budget; bombolini (new mini) $2 or 6 for $9, small $3 or large $4.50. The perfect proportion of filling to soft doughy goodness with a sprinkles of fine sugar on top.

Tried a sample of their flatbread Margarita pizza and it was amazing. Next on the list to try.

Don't let the small size of the shop scare you away, there is plenty of seating upstairs (one large communal table)."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is bliss. Americano was decent. The Nutella Doughnuts are unreal. Small for $3, but filled with delicious Italian imported Nutella. Their salted caramel pudding is also to die for. They just released a new pudding made with pistachio which I will try next time!

Come around 11-12 for fresh pizza at lunch. A+ for tons of seating upstairs at a large communal table. They sell Terroni's hot sauce (next door).

Grab a Nutella doughnut, pull up a bar stool, and watch the well-dressed Queen St W pedestrians walk by the window."}
{"text":"Unfortunately underwhelmed. I was pretty excited to hear that this place opened close to my office, since it seemed to offer some nice Italian choices at a reasonable price. However, the food left much to be desired. The salads were drenched in dressing and only one flavour dominated. The pizza was OK, but food court pizza would taste about the same...I haven't tried the desserts here yet, but after this experience I'm not sure I would be tempted to do so.

Service was also extremely subpar. We were super confused upon walking in - where were we supposed to order, how were we supposed to pay, where the utensils were...everything. And no one offered any assistance whatsoever. Even worse, I had to stand with my hand outstretched for quite a bit of time before any staff member even paid me any attention and could serve me food! I'm not sure if they were understaffed, or just disorganized.

This would honestly be a two-star review, if it wasn't for the fact that the restaurant was nice in terms of environment. The decor was cute."}
{"text":"Walked in and was impressed by the first floor where they had all the pastries displayed. But my friend was too hungry so we went upstairs to the dining area. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. We waited for a table...stood there for more than 15 minutes with no hostess greeting us or taking us to a table (mind you, the place was half empty). Finally the hostess came and escorted us to the table. 
Sat down, they got my order wrong! The food was salty and overpriced for the amount they serve. Later, it turns out that they are part of Terroni. 
Kind of disppointed."}
{"text":"well lookie here! the Terroni attitude is starting to show.  This place has a bar eating area at the bottom floor and a quite large table with chair upstairs (20 steps of steep stairs).  We have been there multiple times and usually either bring a \"totseat\" for our toddler (basically a strapping gadget that you add to a chair) or lug our giant stroller up the stairs.  The last time, I asked if they plan on getting a high chair in the future since it's so new.  While tiny establishments get a pass, this place has the space!  You can say \"no\" in many different ways but the answer we got is \"we're not really meant for that\" \"we don't have the space\" .  What does that mean?  you don't want kids?  this is no fancy restaurant.  The right thing to say is \"i'll mention that to my manager\" or \"we'll look into this\".  Even if you don't end up looking into it, don't brush me off.  Later on, a staff member did talk to us and say \"sorry we're still fairly new\".  So we'll see how it goes next time.   We'll probably go back and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at 8am on Labor Day as my partner had to work. The croissant sandwiches looked appealing but for $7.25 a pop I expected something more fresh. The croissants tasted day-old. I got the one with a frittata filling and my partner had one with edam and tomato. It was alright. Several people were taking selfies with their food. The restaurant is organized in a weird way where you had to get food at respective coffee, desert or pastry islands and pay at the end of each line. It seemed inefficient, and was unintuitive to newcomers. The coffee is what you'd expect from a thirdwave place."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! LOVE THIS PLACE. Wow, so happy this opened up! I was walking around and dropped in to see what all the hype was about on an regular week day. Wasn't as busy as the weekend. Run an Italian family business. Great, professional, upbeat service! So much selection! I love their modern, cozy, rustic feeling inside (lots of exposed brick and dark walls).

Tasted their cannoli (over $2 each) and tiramisu (over $4 each) and bombolones.

Cannoli: EXQUISITE! Their cannoli filling was rich, creamy, thick, slightly tangy, and had dreamy texture. I loved that they added candied orange on one side and pistachios on the other for amazing crunch and complimenting textures. The shell was hard and crunchy, dabbled with powdered sugar. So delicious!

Tiramisu: Fantastic! A bit pricey for the size I got, but wow! The filling was dispersed in between 3 very thin layers of cake and topped with a very rich, dark chocolate powder. I cherished every single bite!

Bombolones: TO DIE FOR! Crema or nutella, but I prefer the crema!

Verdict: Bit pricey. Absolutely a fan of this Italian bakery, looking forward to coming back for more (pizza, sandwiches, freshly baked bread, gelato, and bombolones)!"}
{"text":"Disorganized and over priced for what you get
The staff seems confused on the pricing of individual items versus the pairings"}
{"text":"This place has two levels: the more casual La Mensa for quick bites, espresso and cocktails on the first floor, and Da Geppetto, a cozy dining room on the second floor. This review is for the latter.

We started with mozzarella di bufala, possibly among the freshest I've had in the city to date. It was creamy yet light on the palate, a really great start to the meal. It got us excited for the next dish, what more could you ask from an antipasto?

I had to go for the spaghetti alla carbonara. I'm just a creamy type person. There are worse vices! Anyway, the guanciale added that satisfying salty bite I was looking for. The egg and pecorino just tied the whole thing together in a beautiful, creamy package.

I barely had room, but I have a second stomach for desserts. I tried the regular-sized bombolone with Nutella. I mean, it's fried dough sprinkled with sugar and stuffed with Nutella. I would've eaten half a dozen if I had less self control. It was great, A+ would order again.

I can't wait to come back and work through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Th food was too salty, but service was okay. Since they made up for it by asking us not to pay for the food..."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers I found this place to be a disappointment.  The cafe on the lower level serves up a decent variety of food but I found the quality to be subpar to the Queen street location. The pizza crust is extremely chewy and the toppings not as anundant as I am used to.

The restaurant upstairs is pricey for what you get. The plates are very small and the food itself is bland and not good at all. I ordered a pasta and it basically tasted like chef boyardee believe it or not. The servers don't know much about the wines offrred on the menu and aren't allowed to offer samples which I find to be unusual as this is the only restaurant in Toronto I have been to that has denied me a sample of wine. 

All in all would try the lower level food again but not the upper restaurant. You're better off going to terroni which costs less and tastes a lot better. Which I know is surprising as they are basically sister restaurants."}
{"text":"UPDATE:

I came here again with my wife to do some work and was a bit disappointed this time. First, there is no wifi and they encouraged me to pick up the wifi from their neighbours, Dineen. Second, there are absolutely no outlets in sight. And third, they refused to warm up the pasty I bought. Apparently their microwave/toaster is for \"food only\". I wasn't aware that pastries didn't count as food. Anyway, I still love the idea of this place but I guess it's not the best coffee shop to get work done."}
{"text":"There is a combo available for a main and side dish for $13.99. All the food is available cooked already like cafeteria style. For the ambiance and location, price is great. Food has been sitting there for a while, so it's hit or miss. Our table did not enjoy the food we had, all tasted like sad airplane food.


Unless I'm in a crunch for time, I won't be back.

Service was fast, with many people available for assistance"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Sud Forno. It's nestled amongst the many dessert places and restaurants in the Trinity Bellwoods area, but they are a Standout. I'm glad (and sad) that I don't live too close to this place or I'll just go crazy on carbs. It's a classic space to grab a quick bite or sit to enjoy your lunch or a bit of dolce. I make my way to Sud Forno atleast once a month. The walk is about half an hour each way... but Oh So Worth It! It can be easily TTC'd but the walk is much needed to burn off the calories.
The main reason I love this place is their Bombolone with custard. It's so simple but unforgettable. Perfectly soft dough filled with delicious custard. Just the right amount of sweetness. Their varioud pizza and panini are equally amazing with a good crunch. Other musts are the bombolone with nutella, cannoli and tiramisu.
The staff is always ready to help with lots of smiles. Plus... you can hear them speak italian... aahhhh... bring me back to Italy.
I highly recommend Sud Forno if you're in the area or just make your way out there."}
{"text":"So I decided to come here for a nice post workout meal. While in line I was viciously addressed by an overly impatient customer behind me, I guess I upset him because I didn't order in the .5 seconds after the person in front of me. 

After I had ordered my brussel sprout salad and eggplant parm, the disgruntled dude proceeded to harass people making sandwiches. I guess he was in a yeasty mood. 

Anyways, the eggplant parm was really nice, and I ended up getting a lovely piece with the crispy Parmesan edges. Brussel sprout salad nice and bright with great nuttiness from the toasted almonds. As Schwarzenegger once said in that movie that one time \"I'll be back\", and ya I will.. I'll be back. 

Shout out to the staff who had to deal with disgruntled dude and also told him to chill when he was breathing disgrunt in my direction. Mad props!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the margherita pizza, quinoa, the Panino Classico and a dessert pastry.
Fast service. The panino was delicious, but the bread was quite hard. Quinoa was really good- citrusy with nuts, beans, and cheese to balance out the flavour. Pizza was subpar. Pastry dessert was really yummy. It was a deep fried doughnut filled with Nutella and cream (can't remember the name, started with a b).
Would only go back for the quinoa/other salads for the price and for other pastries."}
{"text":"Make an amazing espresso just like they do in Italy. Their cornetti are as good or even better than I've had on a recent trip to Rome. Great overall vibe and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here for a coffee fix but when I saw people getting Bombolone, a fried sweet doughnut filled with Nutella or vanilla pastry cream, I had to get some too. They have smaller, bite size of those sinful doughnuts, the bombolini. We got 6 for $10 of the Nutella ones and devoured them in no time. Sugary on the outside, soft when bitten into and so generously filled with Nutella. 

If there's one thing to get at Sud Forno, it's the bombolone/bombolini."}
{"text":"We were looking for some place new to eat and decided to try this place out. We were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance, service and ultimately the food!  After checking out the pictures of the food, we wanted to try out the pizza which looked delicious.  The Calabrisella was incredibly tasty, with a crispy bottom. By far one of the best we've tasted....and being Italian, we've had many!  Two of us had the spaghetti cooked perfectly al dente, seasoned with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, basil and lobster. Others had the halibut with brussel sprouts, butternut squash and hazelnuts....also very delicious. The assortment of Italian wines was endless!  And to complete the night, coffees with bomboloni with Nutella and biscotti.

Our waitress was so friendly and informative as well. The four of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and would not hesitate to return or to refer others. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Beautiful simple paper packaging. But the inside stuff needs a little work. 

Pizza was nice reheated for a park picnic. We had the funghi and the 'nduja. 

The cookies were not the greatest unfortunately. My friend and I ordered a variety of things. Most were a similar texture - short bread esque- and not really reminiscent of \"real\" Italian cookies at all. 

Stick to cannoli or something different than cookies if you wanna try this place out."}
{"text":"Bombolone. Bombolone. Bombolone. Hands down the best thing about Sud Forno. Get the regular size nutella bombolone or you will regret it! In fact, get 2! The second best is the decor - wow this place is beautiful. That's about the only good things I have to say about the lower level cateferia-style eatery. The hot food was blah and pricey. Probably the worst porchetta sammie I ever had. Having to ask them to warm it up also killed my vibe. I was not a fan of lining up at different stations for the different types of food - bye bye lunch hour trying to get pizza, salad and a bombolone, then another lineup on top of that to pay. I heard a few other patrons confused about which food lineup they were in. That's my first experience and probably my last at this location, but I would give the upstairs a go. Hopefully the quality of food and service is better there. Such a shame since I'm a fan of the other location."}
{"text":"A great bakery! The mushroom pizza was very flavourful. The quiche with walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese was fantastic. Great atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"I was lucky to sample the Sud lunch box today brought in for a work function and it was amazing! A Panino Classico, small salad and a San Pellegrino were included. Checking out their website and can't wait to venture to their location and sample everything."}
{"text":"Great setting and atmosphere. Went there twice. Their coffee and pastries are good. Enjoyed the cannoli! Well done!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely nice even when they are busy. Try their mini pastries so you can try them all. Really good and lightly sweet"}
{"text":"Love this place. Owned by Terroni next door (also great) it began as their baking kitchen but took on a life of its own. Their pizzas, salads and pastries are delicious, they also stock delectable Italian imports great for gifting."}
{"text":"The pastries are very well made, not only they look good, but they also taste very good! I did not like the setting of the environment though, not many seats, and all are very close to one another, not to mention in order to get my coffee and pasties I had to make two separate orders and pay at different registers, I mean, the place is only so big... Also, WITH THE TAG OF FREE WIFI, THERE IS ACTUALLY NO WIFI!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying their tiramisu. I ended up getting a piece for $8 and tax. It was truly disappointing. Real shame I had to come out here. Only good thing was the service which was quick and friendly. They do have a wide selection + a pizza corner maybe try those instead."}
{"text":"Gelato from Heaven.  I cannot add to that, except to say TRY IT!!!  Thank you Sud Forno.  I see a long lasting relationship between your gelato and my happy taste buds."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food and service. Also appreciate the mini cone option for the gelato when you just need a little taste."}
{"text":"Sud is one of the best this city offers. All baked goods are extremely fresh and true to their origins. 
Staff is great. 
The interior is a bit dark for my taste but its very clean nonetheless.
Always a stop in our Queen Street strolls."}
{"text":"A latest offering from the Terroni family of restaurants. This stretch of queen street seems to be lined with them. This one somewhat different from their mainstay as its a bakery with a pizza corner thrown in for good measures. This was mainly a takeout session so I picked up a couple of Zeppoli and a cannoli (with pistachio filling). They do offer espresso based drinks and I will be back for those. 
The Zeppoli was good nice custard cream filling. I didn't try the cannoli but it did go well with the friends. 
I will back for a cappuccino and dessert if I am in the area and report back."}
{"text":"WOW, the coffee & tea drinks here are amazing. The staff is very friendly, not surprised, its Canada. The sweets are overpriced but croissants are def worth it. Tried almost every sweet from the \"bakery\" section. 
The decor here too is just very very nice. You could sit here for hours and not get tired. Its also clearly very good because its packed open to close. Had my visit to Toronto been a bit longer, would have grabbed a sandwich for lunch and even dinner on the second floor."}
{"text":"We went to grab a pizza here after going to trinity bellwoods park. They have a lot of different combination for pizza toppings and it's all fresh and you have the option to have it warmed up. It's a small store so it's better for grab and go but they do have a counter top if your wanting to sit down. My fave thing to do is is grab a slice and going to the park and enjoying it in the park."}
{"text":"Delighted to find this place again! Authentic Italian - fantastic thin crisp pizza, delicious eggplant ricotta basil sandwiches,  decadent donuts, and buzz inducing coffee. It's so good it made us super excited to be moving to Toronto - even though we were last here in the winter. (And it feels like winter in sunner because they blast too much air conditioning.) If you like rum, don't miss the Baba - it's one of the best sweet treats I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just amazing - I had the smoked salmon croissant three months ago but it still finds me in my happiest dreams. Certainly not the healthiest option for the likes of you who frequent the infamous iQ or Kupfert & Kim (which aren't really infamous at all, I'm just not the biggest salad fan!) for lunch, but tasty and indulgent. The croissant is hot, crispy and flaky and pairs beautifully with the smooth texture of the thinly sliced salmon and cream cheese - just incredible. It smells of happiness. I had a combo box that included some greens as well (note - this might just be a catering option as we ordered as a group of ~15) which I was not as fond of (mostly arugula and some cherry tomatoes, if memory serves - think some added nuts or a unique dressing could go a long way to elevate this one). The location is also quite convenient if you work in the financial district and don't mind a reasonable walk (~7-10 mins from Union) to get a great meal. All around, I'm impressed and eager to return."}
{"text":"Really great flat bread and gelato. I haven't had such great tasting pizza dough in a while ! A great place to grab a very tasty quick snack to go."}
{"text":"The mini cannoli was our preferred and regular treat each week.
The shell, ricotta, chocolate chips, pistachio & candied orange all hit the mark.  
Sadly, the experience began to diminish as they started to make them smaller.
Now, the experience is ridiculous...the size shrunk further to thumb length/one bite.
There will be no more cannoli from this place.
Either do it right and charge accordingly or don't bother.
Forno Cultura has plans to sell cannoli so hopefully they can avoid this mistake."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is across the street from Dineen Coffee and part of the Terroni group of restaurants, so many items will be familiar if you've eaten there. 

They serve pizza, sandwiches, salads and an amazing selection of bread and desserts, as well as brunch. They also have a separate coffee bar during the day so you can grab a quick espresso, latte or macchiato to take back to the office. 

For me, three things stand out: first, the architecture. This space is worth a visit just to see it. It's European inspired and very instagram worthy. Two, their sandwiches. While a little on the expensive side, they are very well prepared with simple, quality ingredients you can taste! They take you back to Europe. Lastly, their desserts. They're known for their sugar-dusted bombolone. They come in Nutella or Crema flavours. My personal favourite it the crema."}
{"text":"We went there for an office party and had a meal of several courses. 

antipasto and homemade bread 
salad, deep fried cod 
pizza pockets
cheese pizza 
pasta and gnocchi with tomato sauce only and nothing on it
ravioli with butternut squash filling in butter cream sauce 
deserts (tiny tim bit like things with fillings and panna cotta) 

Antipasto was good (not much you can do wrong with that?). The rectangular shaped cheese pizza was hard and dry like rock. 
Overall it felt like the chefs were afraid to add salt to the food in general and we didn't have neither salt nor pepper on the tables. The pasta, gnocchi and ravioli were a bit bland, like really boring. There was no garnish no nothing. You can make that at home without killing yourself.

Based on what I ate this wasn't the best Italian food I have ever had and I don't feel an urge to go back any time soon.

Note:
The food on their regular menu may be better than what we were served at the party."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of colleagues for lunch.   We had a great time and the food was fantastic.  We were a group of 5 and we ordered a plate each.  

I ordered a pizza the Calabrisella, which has tomato sauce, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, parmigiano, n'duja, basil. The smaller size is $19.00 and has 6 large slices.   The combination of ingredients on this pizza was Devine! The best part was the crust! 

For dessert we had a bombolone, this delicious doughnut was filled with Nutella.   I could not stop eating it!  I bought a mini one and I knew I should have ordered the larger portion.   

If you are looking for a great chic place to have a friendly lunch I would definitely stop by Sudforno!"}
{"text":"In addition to amazing pastries, this place has an excellent space on the second floor for private events. I hosted a 20 person dinner there this weekend and it was awesome. The food we ordered (family style) was probably better suited to a lunch (antipasto, salad, pizza, etc) but the space was perfect for our group and the staff here (in particular Alesandro) were totally top notch. Super accommodating, on the ball, and always cheerful. I would definitely do it again. Big love for this place now!"}
{"text":"First off - This review is only about desserts and drinks. Amazing selection, great service and delicious baked goods puts this spot high on my revisit list. If you haven't stopped by, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Cute spot on bottom floor for quick bite / coffee & dessert. Good for people who are on the go or grabbing a quick lunch for work around the area. Upper floor you can dine in and order more items such as pastas i believe. Overall food was mediocre - i dined in on the bottom floor but the food items were not hot. I enjoyed the latte the most! Would come back solely for their coffee and possibly desserts for a chit chat w friends"}
{"text":"I'm literally obsessed with this place. I recently moved from Italy and I've been so home sick; missing my food especially. But now that I got to know this place I'm in peace. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"I've given Sud Forno many chances to receive a higher review. After many visits I've come to the conclusion that this place is a little disappointing.

I tried to love Sud Forno, trying many of their dishes since they opened. In the past I have ordered many of the desserts as well as their pizza and a veal sandwich, all of which were quite pricey and not very tasty. 

Today I visited to meet a friend for coffee. I was in the mood for a large cup of joe and ordered a large drip coffee with a splash of lactose free milk. I was disappointed to learn that there was no drip coffee available and no lactose free milk. Instead I received a small \"coffee\", that was mostly foam.

Sud Forno, if you want to steal business from local competitors, you should offer a variety of milk options and better food & coffee. I'll be visiting Dineen for my next coffee date."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is a great lunch spot for whatever you are feeling. A large variety of sandwich, salad, flatbread, hot meal, and dessert options, you can't go wrong! Although there are cheaper places to grab lunch in the downtown area, you can't beat Sud Forno's ambience. 

It does get pretty busy around lunch time, but you can generally find a spot for one or two. Larger groups might be trickier. Maybe not a spot for every day lunch, but it's a treat!"}
{"text":"Bread, baked goods, coffee, treats, yum.

Sud Forno kind of reminds me of a really nicer Panera if that makes any sense.  Their baked stuff is on full display behind the glass just asking to be purchased.  The displays are attractive sure but they sell themselves by looking the way they do, almost within reach but you can just look and not touch that is unless you buy them.

I ended up getting a couple of cornettos  for my wife because she loves them so.  The last time she had them was in Chicago at Eataly I think and that was a while ago.

Italian stuff yes just like that mashed up red pepper in olive oil in jars by the entrance.  That stuff is must have on pasta etc.  The stuff I get is usually Tutto Calabria though.  Nice place if you like good things Italian."}
{"text":"This place looks much better than what it really is.  

Today I ordered the lasagna and a small cannella (cinnamon roll).  

Took my meal to the park.  My expectations were high since I've been to this place a few times and the food has been 4 stars.  As I ate the lasagna there was a chunk of something solid in it.  Like perhaps a bone fragment from the ground beef/pork.  Whatever it was, I couldn't finish it because also the flavor was so bland.  Did they forget to sauce it?

At this point I had the small cannella which I was exited about.  I mean their pastries look really good on display.  And I had the nutella stuffed before, it was fluffy and sweet.  

However this time when I broke apart the roll, I noticed a hair inside the pastry.  wtf!! I wish I had a DNA test kit to identify who's hair is it and I could yell at them to stop putting hair on the pastries!! I have been using yelp for years, but was never motivated enough to post a bad review.  

Until now!"}
{"text":"Picture this- a sugary donut-like baked good, coated in a generous portion of sugar, filled up with an even more generous portion of Nutella. This is precisely what I continuously come back to this bakery for! 

As much as I'd love to review every baked item they sell, I am one of those customers who always comes back for their Nutella bombolone. It's just that good!!"}
{"text":"Carbonara With the Lamb Rugu was tasting great but small portion for the prIce. Service was good. 

Also went a second time for beee with a friend and the first floor was really cozy to be late evening and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Carbonara With the Lamb Rugu was tasting great but small portion for the prIce. Service was good."}
{"text":"Really lovely cafe in Queen West. Everything from the delicious pastries and pizza, to the friendly staff is a great experience. 

They have a few bar seats downstairs with full windows looking out on to Queen street, or a communal table upstairs where many people work or have meetings. 

I had a London Fog. I don't know if it's on the menu but when I asked the staff were happy to make their version. And we got a few of the smaller pastries to split, they were filled with cream or Nutella, highly dangerous! 

I can't wait to come back and spent more time sampling all of their baked goods. I've heard wonderful things about the pizza as well so that's most definitely on the list too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dessert bombolone after dinner on a Friday. 
I was obsessed with walking around and around the counter...every time I noticed something new and delicious! 
We got nutella and crema bombolone and they were AMAZING. I am still craving them. They were super fresh and really soft and tasty. I would like to return and try their pizza/other offerings sometime as well."}
{"text":"We ordered squid ink pasta el dente, Carbonara and flatbread pizza. It is a hipster Italian restaurant and its atmosphere is very cozy and nice. But the core of the squid ink pasta is too hard to bite. The Carbonara is flavorless."}
{"text":"Yummy pastries and cappuccino. Perfect spot for an afternoon break and chit chat. Will have to return for lunch to try the flatbreads and sandwiches and maybe a glass of vino."}
{"text":"Good spot for all things Italian except for the pizza. My friends and I really enjoyed Sud Forno. The service was excellent and attentive. Note there are two sections to this restaurant, a casual dining/cafeteria style downstairs and a seated dining upstairs. If you made reservations, it would be for the upstairs section.
We shared a few dishes and all loved the eggplant, Capunti col sugo della domenica and the dessert (pistachio gelato bar and tiramisu)."}
{"text":"???????1?????????????????????????

?????"}
{"text":"They serve delicious gelato flavours. Recommend the hazelnut one!

Would come back to try their pastries as didnt get a chance to since we just ate dinner."}
{"text":"The food was nothing worth the price charged. The pasta was not fresh and undercooked, then it was replaced with a pizza. This was the worst meal I've had all year and have been to quite a few places. I would not recommend or ever return. If you do, please do so at your own risk."}
{"text":"I was strolling through Queen West with a friend and came upon this place. Having seen pictures of their Nutella bombolone (essentially a donut), I knew I had to go in and grab one to try myself. Apart from a selection of sweet offerings, they also have sandwiches, pizza, fresh bread, and coffee. 

It was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon, but service was relatively fast. It didn't look like there was much room to sit inside, but it didn't matter to me since I was taking my bombolone to go. 

The Nutella bombolone is essentially just fried dough with a heaping amount of Nutella stuffed inside, which I won't complain about. Definitely give it a try if you love donuts. It certainly satisfied my craving for one. They also have a pastry cream version, which I'll have to try for next time, along with some of their savoury offerings."}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch!! Enjoyed dessert more than actual lunch. Pizza was okay, the crust is really good.
Cannoli was amazing! Took me back to my trip in italy.
There are also Nutella bombs (forgot the name) which ARE AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale bakery with unique baked goods with a nice dosage of nutella and gelato."}
{"text":"We only got the \"Fig & Ricotta\" gelato, but still amazing flavor, super creamy."}
{"text":"We came into this cafe while walking along Queen Street. Sud Forno is an Italian Bakery that sells delicious treats for your sweet tooth such as biscotti, cookies, cannolis, bambalones. In addition, they also sell sandwiches and other savoury foods for cafes.

The upstairs seating area is comprised of a huge table with a large window- definitely a place to check out if you want to host an event fit for roughly 25 people. It's got this rustique, hipster feel towards it. Upstairs, there are cups and water available for guests with no time limit - also a great place for students to come and study.

Food: We got the nutella bambalone which is like a donut with rich nutella squeezed inside. Of course, who doesn't love nutella? They also have the custard option, both for $3.The chocolate cookie was a little dry for my preference and was less than a dollar for a super small cookie. I've never had a cannolli before, but for something roughly the size of a USB, it was a little over $2 and had pistachio nut on one side and was filled with cream.The last one was the sfogliatelle, it was definitely hard to pronounce, but that one was my favourite as the texture was flakey and crunchy and baked perfectly."}
{"text":"Excellent Classico sandwich with prosciutto crisp, tomato, basil, and fior di latte. Heated to perfection with a crispy crust, chewy bread and perfect balance of savory, salty prosciutto, smooth fresh mozzarella, and fresh burst of tomato. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had and if it wasn't for this darn lactose intolerance, I would be living off these. But as is, I can only eat 2 at a time. Life...

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Terroni's but never heard of this offshoot until my cousin met someone who works at the Queen Street location.

I ate at Terroni's last night at their Adelaide Street location with my cousin and others. Usually, we'd cap off our meal with their tiramisu but this time, we decided to ask for the bill before dessert and head over to Sud Forno instead.

When we arrived at about 7:15pm, the main floor was relatively busy. Apparently, there is a dining area on the second floor. There was a large crowd around the main floor bar area but we went straight for dessert. I had the butterscotch pudding and rum cake and the others had different cakes as well as a gelatto popsicle.

At the end of dessert, I checked out the other parts of the ordering stations and they had a variety of salads, pastas and pizzas, some that I recognize from the Terroni's menu.

Since I work in the area, I foresee myself swinging by to pick up many lunches either to dine-in, eat outside at the park on Temperance, or to take back to the office. The concept is like a cafeteria but the food is gourmet. This is going to be good."}
{"text":"Italian desserts, fresh coffee and snack-sized pizzas. A holy trinity of food and drink.

If you can't decide like we did, go for the bomboloni! You can't go wrong with chocolate or cream. The americano was delish.

The decor is a delightful blend of old world European with modern finishes. Head upstairs for nice open seating. There's also a patio upstairs in the back for when the weather's good!

Sud Forno is part of the Terroni restaurant family - so you know it's legit and good."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful new spot in the Financial District!

I have only tried their lunch, or to go food, and it is delicious a good option in the Final district, it definitively competes with Forno Di Cultura!

The pizza is delicious, the perfect dough and sauce! Nothing to envy to Libretto. Also, the salads are creative very good and fresh ingredients!

The desserts are from the proper Italian cuisine, really tasty and the presentation is beautiful! Perfect to take to any gathering.

I am looking forward to having some drinks there, love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice spot on Queen West, and I originally came in on a recommendation from a friend.  I've been here a few times since then just for their delicious bomboloni and would recommend these to anybody with a sweet tooth.

On my last visit I was snapping a photo of the bomboloni display and was told that photos were not allowed inside. Considering how many photos are up here on Yelp, I don't see the fuss. Perhaps it was my using a camera rather than a smartphone. The lady asked if the photos were meant to be put up on a blog, and I said no these were just travel photos. She didn't bother me after that, but it soured my experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful warm atmosphere. It looks like they spent an enormous amount of money on the designs and interior decoration. We dined at the restaurant upstairs. The short run tomato sauce pasta and the ricotta filled white sauce pasta was was absolutely to die for. And that wasn't even the best part; their desserts! Nutella filled donut and cannoli was crazy good. Although best cannoli I have had is still the ones from Ardo restaurant on king east. Super nice and lovely experience. Ate with so much appreciation, forgot to take pictures. Next time!"}
{"text":"The food is average. I came by around 7ish so the pastries I had were kind of stale. Hilariously and obnoxiously the music was WAY TOO LOUD. It's like a club in here. Pizza was average.

I've been here twice, once mid afternoon and it was the same thing, except they were blasting techno and deep house at 2pm. LOL.

Please lower the music, it's really obnoxious. I think the food could had been amazing if fresh. The wine and service was very good and friendly in the front so props for that (although the girls in the back seemed a bit off, kind of snooty and seemed dismayed I ordered only 2 pastries and repeated twice if that was all I wanted- uh, yeah I'm on a diet and wanted to save room for coffee and booze....). I guess you can't control human nature. 

Improve the food and turn down the music!"}
{"text":"Love the mid day Dj, beautiful ambiance and great cappuccinos. It's exactly like the cafes in Milan with the hustle and high bar tops. The foods a bit on the pricier side for what it is (i.e. $10 side salads) but it's worth it for a treat. I'll be back again to bring Friends."}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch spot for me. The food is good, lets get that out of the way first. The lunch box combo is tasty and filling for the price. Their bread is excellent.

My problem is how inconsistent everything costs and how every person behind the counter seems to have a different idea of what to charge. I ordered a lunch box, but having had the Classico a few times I wanted to change it up. I asked to get the Toscano sandwich instead, as they are the same price ($8.5 on the sign in the store and on their website). The lady said sure, and charged me the regular price for the lunch box ($12). The next day I go back and ask for the same thing, lunch box with the Toscano instead of the Classico. It's a different server behind the counter this time and she says no, they can't do that. I ask why and she says the Toscano costs more. Confused, I ask how much more because yesterday it wasn't a problem and the cost was posted as $8.5 which is the same as the Classico but today there are no prices on the sandwiches in the window. She tells me it costs $3 more for the Toscano. I said ok, thinking maybe the lady who served me yesterday was just being nice or something, and offer to pay the difference because I actually prefer the Toscano to the Classico. She tells me, no, they can't do that and I'll have to buy each thing separately ($11.50 for the Toscano, $5.50 for the salad, and $2.00 for a drink) which is over $20. So I just get the regular lunch box with the Classico because that is more than I want to spend on lunch. I go back the next day and sure enough, the prices are back up and the Toscano is costs the same as the Classico ($8.5). What the heck? I ask and this time they just say no, and the only thing I can have with the lunch box is the Classico or the vegetarian sandwich (which is posted as costing less than the Classico but whatever) and they are giving me a lot of attitude for asking. 

I understand that some of their sandwiches cost more money, that is fine. I'm not asking for their more expensive smoked salmon for the same price as a cheaper sandwich. I'm happy to pay the difference if they would let me. But the two sandwiches cost the same amount (depending on who is at the till apparently). I just don't understand why they are giving their customers such a hard time with ordering a meal. Their prices make no sense and I get the impression that no one behind the counter knows what to charge.

Ultimately, I'm left feeling disappointed and confused every time I leave their shop but keep going back because its them or subway when it comes to getting a sandwich in the area. At least at subway I know what I'll be charged when I reach the till."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: Charming communal table on the second floor with self-serve water. Great place to catch-up with a friend! 

FOOD: Opera cake is lovely and the brownie isn't sweet either. In small doses, the salted caramel pudding can hit that sugar-craving of yers. The pizzas are alright - nothing mind-blowing.

NOTE: Don't forget to take your trays to the bins once you're done! So many people leave and forget to do their part!"}
{"text":"Good Decaf iced americano.
Cookies had nut shells in them. Really over priced for what they are."}
{"text":"I was waiting for MONTHS for this location to open! I was freaking out as I entered.

It's right across from Dineen which closes ever so early and sells out of everything after lunch. But this Sud Forno is huge, open late and has a wide variety of food, even at 8:30PM. The open venue had me in awe the whole time because the marble, woodwork, intricate mosaic floors and of course the balance of traditional and modern design was just so stunning.

This is a beautiful venue with separate food stations that functions like a cafeteria. I had the pizza, lemon tonic water + mini custard donut. Everything on the menu is pretty straight forward with a modern Italian twist. Can't wait to go back and enjoy their sandwiches and salads next. Great location, venue, and food + service was excellent. Most instagram-worthy of 2017 in Toronto. 5 stars indeed!

p.s. Their 2nd floor is also their Italian restaurant, Terroni."}
{"text":"Their new location is on Yonge st. and it is gorgeous. This place is not just a cafe, they also have a bakery and full service restaurant upstairs. The atmosphere is always buzzing and it makes for a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch or coffee break with friends"}
{"text":"Noticed a few good reviews online about this places pizza slice so gave them a try.

To start the slices are bigger than average and $5 and under. They also really hook you up with toppings.

It's pretty hard to find good pizza in Toronto so I'm glad I tried Sud Forno but they still weren't amazing or good enough for me to recommend going out of your way for this place.

If you are close by their slices are a good cheap meal."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place for a date, catching up with a friend, or coming on your own! The bakery treats are to die for. I ordered the Nutella-filled Bombolone and it was delicious! I also wanted a caffeinated drink, wanted a soy latte, but they only have regular milk. No big deal- it's not really known for it's coffee anyway- so I just ordered a regular iced Americano. Not great, but again, I didn't have high expectations for the coffee.

I would definitely come back here. Great ambiance and vibe!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. You walk in, have a sample of their delicious pizza. Talk to some of the staff. Grab a nice cappuccino. You sit at the stay by the window OR go upstairs and wow! What a surprise!

You got this big long family store table. Find a seat wherever! Is beautiful!

Their pizza is amazing. And all you gotta get is the $3 margherita pizza to be happy.

Then you see those donut like desserts. Comes in large, small and timbit size! But don't say they like timbits, they'll get offended.

So why only for stars? Wish they had more samples! Nah. With so many pizza options in the city I feel while I do love eating here, there are a few places that have even better pizza. But I'd still see come back here."}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch. Reasonable prices. Gets busy past 12:00 pm. No reservations required to sit on the first floor. Nice communal tables and also booths on the side. Love the dessert area. Nice pizzas and sandwiches. Great for a coffee as well."}
{"text":"Walking in, it's not entirely clear what you're supposed to do. There's a lovely bar in the front and then an impressive wall covered in bread in back. We started walking toward the carbs and came upon the food bar. There are many options here: you can get a salad (or combo), hot plates (combos also available), or pizza. There's also an entire side with beautiful pastries. The staff were very helpful in explaining everything to us newbies, serving our choices, and quickly reheated my friend's chickpea soup when she requested it. The eggplant parm was very good, and the bread is fresh, made in-house. We closed our meal with mini bombolones - cinnamon sugar donuts filled with Nutella or cream. Heavenly! The space is beautiful, especially when decorated for the holidays, and there was even a DJ in the corner spinning some beats during lunch. This is a fun little trip to Italy with a Canadian twist. Grazie, Sud Forno!"}
{"text":"Went there for a slice of pizza, as recommended by a friend. Turns out it was more just a slice of pizza. The atmosphere is very casual and it is more of a cafe/bakery; however, I was told that they have another restaurant close by that is run by the same owners. The slice of pizza was served hot and it was delicious! Will definitely go there again to try some of their other flavors."}
{"text":"The Queen st location is also great, yet much smaller.  This location has a really nice design, Yonge St used to die south around Queen st, additions like this help a lot. Great pizza, sandwiches, coffee, pastries."}
{"text":"Awesome idea. Walk in, grab QUALITY slices.. Fresh desserts, coffees, etc. Plus great sandwiches.. Nice to see more of this type of set up in the city."}
{"text":"Good food, but quite expensive.
Pretty nice place, and it's closer so I don't need to go the one on Queen st anymore.
One of the staff was a bit rude. She looked so bored with no smile when I asked some questions, it seemed like she just didn't want to answer it."}
{"text":"Really liked this bakery/coffee shop. Nice decor (with a large communal table upstairs) and great baked goods. Cafe latte was good, the selection of teas, while small, was quite diverse, but the Italian doughnuts and cookies were incredible. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating for this location to open. Extremely excited when I passed by and realized it finally opened. It was very crowded when I stepped in during the afternoon, many people in the area were grabbing hot foods to go. A lot of the food trays were half empty, I can imagine they are selling everything relatively fast since it's a new lunch option in the financial district. 

This location looks very nice, and it is huge. the bread wall also looks amazing!  There are some tables near the bakery section, but there is additional dining area inside. I picked up a few bakery items including a classic croissant,  cannoli,  and biscotti. I wanted to buy more variety but their bakery section had some empty trays since some stuff were already sold out in the afternoon. I will definitely return and hopefully most of the trays won't be so empty next time I come."}
{"text":"My son and I got the gelato here. He really enjoyed the vanilla. I liked the lemon. The lemon is very refreshing and taste natural. The service was lovely and kind. The seating isn't great as no where to sit but they have a cute bench just outside the shop to sit. So during warm days, this is a gem!"}
{"text":"Strolling on a sunny weekday afternoon, I decided to go inside and order a coffee. My decision was quite easy since the place was practically empty, unlike weekends.  I ordered the cafe latte, which comes in a unique size, for $4.50.  It was actually tasty! Very delicious espresso.

The cashier was very lovely as she entertained all my questions and explained the differences between the various coffee drinks. I am not a coffee drinker, so I tend to forget what is what.

They also sell the most beautiful looking pastries. But I was a good girl and stayed away from fat, for one day.

I enjoyed my cafe latte sitting on the bar window staring at the world outside pass me by. I spent a good quality 30 minutes, at least."}
{"text":"Ate upstairs at the sit down restaurant part, unfortunately the food was very disappointing.  Being part of the Terroni family I expected the same bold, unique flavours but instead got bland, meh pasta with the most interesting thing about them being the complicated names in the menu.  The carbonara had a large portion of lamb in it but unfortunately lacked flavour or taste.  One of our dishes was supposed to be al dente but was basically served raw in the middle.  I hope they review the menu and maybe bring some help in to save what is otherwise a great looking location and vibe. Music was amazing though..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous cafe with actually really good service and food and drinks. The fresh baked Italian sugary goodness are so worth indulging on 
They do get busy - so maybe not best for first dates, but great place to catch up with friends for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times (its close to my work and central) and they never disappoint me with their pastry options. This review is not about the food but about their service. I've dined both on the second floor and the main (self service) and find the cashier on the main atrocious to deal with. After paying 12.00 for a cold egg omelette dish, I went back to ask to have it warmed up and was treated with such attitude as if I had insulted her. I mean seriously, who eats a cold egg omelette?!? I asked if it could be popped into the microwave or warmed up as it's cold to the touch and she told me   We don't have microwaves. I'll have to put it in the oven for you! Took my dish and walked off. Upon returning I thanked her and she said nothing. I'm sorry did I do something to you???

Left quite a sour taste in my mouth. Unfortunate as there is no other way to get the food and you have to deal with her. She should not be working front lines in customer service."}
{"text":"Very good food (a bit overpriced though) and good location. The cool thing about this restaurant is that you can choose a quick lunch downstairs or a more. sophisticated lunch in a served table upstairs"}
{"text":"Seems to be a highly recommended spot for a quick coffee and pastry, but my experience was a sit down lunch in the upstairs service area. 

We were sat pretty quickly after a staff noticed we seemed a bit lost downstairs. :) 

My cousin ordered what I think was a meat filled Tortellone. It was incredibly soft and well seasoned! I ordered the Carbonara, which is pretty much my go to pasta dish. It was delicious with generous cheese and bacon bits inside. I did find that it was a touch too salty as I was reaching for the water pretty much every other bite. But the portion size was great and I enjoyed the meal :)

My boyfriend ordered a pizza/sandwhich which was the Farcito Classico i believe. It was incredibly fresh and came as more of a sandwhich style. We've never had that before, but it was delicious! The mix of flavours made it taste really light. 

It's definitely, no questions, on the pricier side, but if you're looking for a nice pasta fill, this is a pretty great spot to hit!"}
{"text":"Got some \"take away\" Valentines Day baked goods here. Tasted delicious. Though the smaller mousse-based bakery sweet creations do not \"travel well\", I wish they would reinforce the more delicate creations with some extra hard paper so they stay a bit more sturdy. Look forward to going here again for the vibe and some traditional yummy cookies."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I come here for lunch quite often.  Such a cute spot for a coffee or some food.  Everything I'd tried here has been so fresh and delicious.  From the pizzas, the panninis, lasagna, salads and the pastries.  YUM!  

It love the European feel and vibe that htis place.  

There's an upstairs, sit down restaurant as well.  Haven't been there yet, but I look forward to checking it out."}
{"text":"You know, I really want to like this place...I really do....

That part of me that longs to like one of those err hipster places, hipsters right?

Came here in person finally and I have to say, I really REALLY want to like this place.  There was a review by food critic Amy Pataki about the eggplant sandwich being so good.  There was a reference to the Sopranos but I dun watch it cuz its too violent.

Anyways, I came here for the eggplant sandwich and got two of those bombalones.  They were made fresh which was a plus.  Asked for them with a light dusting of sugar.

Alright, onto the sandwich...now I really tried my best to want to like this sandwich.  But I was hoping for something like egg plant parmasian, I knew it'd be fried but I was hoping that it'd be hidden from the goodness of the eggplant.  Boy was I wrong.  I found the sandwich to be tasteless, the tomato (a whole roma without the skin) but I didn't see any seasoning.  The bread at the bottom of the sandwich was soggy.  Even though the bread was tough as nails, it lost it's strong dryness after sitting there a while.

They do not reheat any of their sandwiches so it's served at room temperature.

Why did I get egg plant parmasian? I don't even like european egg plant....

Oh well...some of the prices may seem steep (if your buying for someone else, then definately) but if your just ordering for one it's ok.

The staff there (who are all tall girls, hmmm...are they related to someone) seem nice and are informative."}
{"text":"A new bakery/cafe on queen street west.  That as an upstart has a lot going for it. It's from the folks next door that brought you terroni. You will see that name and its products everywhere.

Th interior area and display cases are lovely.  You can't help but want to try everything. I Settled on a square slice of cappricosa pizza. The biggest surprise for me was the crust. You can put anything on this crust perfection. It was thin and crispy yet had this softness to the bread to compliment the ingredients and the crunch of the base. Best pizza crust I have had in this city.

However, I had one of the worst espressos here. I love my coffee. Bitter can be from over-extraction, fines in the coffee, too high a brew temperature. Real espresso is an experience hard to describe, but it's neither bitter or sour.  It should be wonderfully full, deep, slightly sweet, and depending on the blend it leaves an after taste either on the edge or back of the tongue (that isn't bitter).    (I went to dark horse right after, to try and get that espresso taste out of my mouth).

I know they just opened. So like any new place they may need time to work out the kinks. IN addition to the above, there were so many people working behind the counter yet not a single person helped me until  two people walk in. What is up with that?  I know I am short but seriously I was standing in front of your staff?  On top of that, the woman ringing me in overcharged me and completely did notice though she was staring at the screen for the longest time.  


As a new place it needs a little time to find its wings with some things except the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a workday since it's very close to my office. We sat on the first floor and it is \"self serve\" style. They have great salad selections and most importantly great sweets selection! I like they let you pick two kinds of salad for one order. They have a lot of other food selection such as pizza and pasta - wanted to try them next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food on the go! There is a great selection of pastries, bread, sandwiches, and other baked goods. I would highly recommend coming here to grab for on the go, or to bring back home. Although the food here is bit pricier, it's definitely worth it for the quality.

There is a small seating area where you can watch the chefs/bakers make the food. It's a neat place to check out when in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've not had any meals at the new Sud Forno so this rating is just for the desserts... and those were really good! I've had:
- Bombolone: I've had both the nutella and cream ones twice now and cam safely say the bombolone is the star of Sud Forno's sweet offerings. The bread is airy without being dry, the filling is very generous (the nutella or cream both just oooooze out when you take a bite), and it comes in small or big sizes to cater to your appetite. I hope though that the quality continues to be good - last time my husband had the nutella bombolone, there wasn't as much filling.
- Babamisu: Tiramisu with rum was nice and moist
- Sfogliatelle: Ceam-filled pastry tart with strong cherry flavours

I've seen reviews on the meals which aren't been great. Again, I haven't had any meals at Sud Forno but I'd come back here just for the desserts - definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I really tried to like Sud Forno, but I don't think my palate is \"advanced\" enough... It's one of two sister restaurants to Terroni and has a casual cafeteria-style lower level and a more upscale dining area upstairs. For dinner, it's a trendy and dim spot (think candlelight and low hanging lights)... and we had an intimate window seat looking into Dineen Coffee. 

My main beef was that I didn't enjoy the food...I think dessert would've been the saving grace but I was too stuffed. My party of 3 and I shared fluffy room temp bread (why don't they serve it with balsamic vinegar? Am I missing something? The oilve oil was quite bitter, maybe grapeseed?), the antipasto ($25) and the che te mangi ($19 for white pizza w walnuts, honey, pear and prosciutto). I also sampled some of my friend's squid ink pasta, which was supposed to be served warm instead of piping hot...

I think I ordered the item I would have liked the most from the menu (they wasn't a wide variety to choose from) but was pretty disappointed, especially because the food was so overpriced.

All in all, cool atmosphere. If I *had* to come back I would just order desserts."}
{"text":"Picked up some amazing deli meat around the corner and wanted some fantastic bread to go with it. My better half suggested this place as it was within a 5 min walk from out home. 

The bread is dope but the attitude is not. The waitress had complete bitch face syndrome. Like ease up and do your job of servicing bread. 

The other disappointment was that they don't slice bread. Like why the hell not? Get to work, invest in some machinery and slice the bread for your customers. This though, is typical Terroni mentality. Start listening to your customers. You don't live in Italy. Sheesh."}
{"text":"It's not easy or always fair to rate an establishment based on just one or two items but there is more to be said about Sud Forno than just the espresso and one-bite pastry that I had. Yes, they were good. My companion also enjoyed her cappuccino and similar pastry.

The atmosphere in this place is really nice and upscale. The food, not just the coffee and pastries, look fresh and very appetizing. Sud Forno is nowhere near my usual routes but I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nice stop for a morning coffee but is not your ordinary cafe where you can get a pastry & coffee for $5.  I found the selection on the expensive side, even more costly than starbucks but is good once in awhile if you want a morning treat!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing (part of the Terroni family). It is a great addition to the financial district core offering a variety of food options, such as salads, sandwiches, breads, pizzas, hot food items, desserts, drinks and your caffeine fix. 

The interior of this place is beautiful. To the uninitiated, when you walk in, you're a bit confused. On the ground floor your eyes will likely gravitate to the bar, the high ceilings and in your peripheral vision, you will see the glorious bread wall. Is it a restaurant? Yes, but the restaurant is upstairs. On the ground floor you get your caffeine fix, alcohol (at the bar), and to-go food items (go to the bread wall). If you opt to buy their to-go food items, you can sit on the ground floor (they provide cutlery and water) - highly recommended to dine in because this place is beautiful. 

I came here on a Friday around 1pm to eat lunch. While it wasn't packed, there was a good amount of people sitting to eat and a good flow of people coming in and out. I went straight for the bread wall. If you're buying a lot of items and you're going to eat in, grab a food tray before you begin. 

After much deliberation I opted for some type of sandwich ($6.50). It was like a very crispy flat bread (which I believe they make in-house) and in between were arugula, prosciutto and cheese, and cherry tomatoes. For dessert, I ordered a bombolone ($3) with crema filling. The best way to describe a bombolone is an Italian doughnut. 

Both were satisfying but I wish the filling in the bombolone had more flavour. Next time, I'll try the bombolone filled with hazelnut filling. However, the texture of the bombolone itself was very nice, light, had a moist interior and optimal amount of chew. 

I will be back for more Friday lunches."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is own by Terroni, so needless to say, it's delicious. Especially their croissant. A little pricey, but it's a treat. They also serve Sloane tea. It is a beautiful space, picture worthy, mostly their tile work! Just magnificent!"}
{"text":"Wandering around the streets of Toronto on a sweltering weekend can make you hangry. 

I just follow a crowd of people right into this place where it was packed.  It took me awhile to scan the place simply because of all the deliciousness going on (mmm samples). 

Extremely well priced (which is rare in this town), we got a porchetta board with a goat cheese-arugula  sandwich and it came with a potato and gorgonzola flatbread plus two drinks came to about $30.  Perfect portions, nailed it. 

Go here if you are looking for simple food, done properly.  Didn't have a chance to try the pastries, they also looked incredible... but hey, now I have another excuse to go back!

Definitely dropping in again, cheers."}
{"text":"A bakery/breakfast spot off Yonge south of Richmond. This review is from the cappuccino/desert perspective. We came mid morning on a Sunday for a cappuccino and desert. The person who took our order was rushing us and we had to sit in a back room because seating was limited.

The place was really confusing, depending what you are ordering you have to go to different areas. I got the feeling that because they are so busy based on the area they dont care about service and quality.

We got Cappuccinos and croissants. Everything we ordered was average and way too small for the price."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick casual lunch on a week day! Nice vibe and they have some space to sit upstairs that's bright and roomy! Food was okay but their desserts and cookies were amazing. Will definitely come back for some coffee and dessert, maybe not lunch.."}
{"text":"I really liked the cannoli because it wasn't really sweet. Now, granted, I ate something sweeter than it so perhaps it dampened it but I will try it again. The hazelnut donuts are delish."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The pizza and sandwiches taste deliciously fresh, and it's immediately obvious that the ingredients are top quality. Their desserts are to die for, and their gelato is unparalleled. Their Crèma is a must have; It's like a vanilla pastry cream turned into gelato. An excellent place to stop for a quick bite or an extended stay."}
{"text":"Ok. Five stars are insufficient. This place is fantastic. We just stopped in for an early dinner and were blown away. The service was exceptional - attentive, polite, suggestions at the ready - and the restaurant itself was delightful - modern, simple and elegant. We had the carbonara pasta and the Calabrisella pizza. The pasta was cooked perfectly - not over-cooked - and the guanciale (cured in-house) made it extra special. The pizza reminded me of a lighter, airier version of my mother's recipe. So good. We had dinner upstairs in the dinning room, and then espresso 
downstairs at the bar. The espresso was perfect, and served in proper thick cups. We got a budino and a baba to go, and I can't decide which was better... I think I'll have to try them once more to decide..."}
{"text":"Loved their mini doughnut with chocolate it it!yummy!i also loved their upstairs room with Ling community table,great for having birthday gathering there!will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cutest lil bakery slash lunch place ever. Only complaint, need more space for all your customers lol

I ordered the pizza slice ($5.50 and they cut it into 2). Delicious, new and fresh flavours, a super experience in my mouth!

For dessert, i chose the torta Caprese ($4) which is a gluten-free dark chocolate cake. It was a tinge on the dry side, but since it had the main ingredient (dark chocolate) it was still easy to consume.

It was a fun experience. They had a communal table upstairs with trendy/industrious bar stools for the dine-iners. Oh and free water (self serve). 

I really enjoy the atmosphere and decorations of this place. A++"}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is beautiful, food is amazing. The cream filled Bombolone is one of the greatest desserts I've ever had!!! I HIGHLY recommend you try them, Pizza is also really good!"}
{"text":"Pastries and desserts here are to die for...I WISH I COULD EAT THEM ALL THE TIME!

This place gets BUSY, so try and make a reservation if you can. The downstairs area is a cafeteria style bar, with the upstairs being the sit down menu. Staff is very friendly and full of recommendations, if you need the help. They have a fun build your own G&T, which instantly won me over as I LOVE G&Ts. 

The pizzas are made with fresh and vibrant ingredients and the dough is soft and fluffy, while not being soggy. They offer red and white pizzas which is a nice change for anyone who doesn't like tomatoes. The fried fish appetizer is small, but tasty with perfectly fried and battered fish and assorted pickled veggies on the side. The cuttlefish salad is interesting conceptually, but pretty unmemorable in terms of flavours, and was definitely missing the fresh crisp bite of fresh veggies. 

The desserts were the real stars, and I honestly believe (after having come back for just desserts) that they are all good. We had the tiramisu (which comes in a cup, and looks small, but is packed with cream and cake), the doughnut (which was fluffy, and light and has a fancy name I cannot remember), and the cannoli (which was beautifully flavoured with hints of orange in the ricotta filling and a crispy shell). I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK FOR MORE DESSERT!"}
{"text":"My happy place! Great coffee, nutella donut balls, pizza, salads, wine...The layout is a bit confusing at first, but the staff are helpful and will guide you through it."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. This bakery knows how to make every person happy. They have a wide variety of baked goods and I recommend trying each and every one. My father usually picks up a new type of bread to allow us to try them all. Go
Go go!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. We had the mushroom pizza and small desserts to share. The pizza just hit the spot. The deserts were also delicious - we had the Nutella filled Italian donuts. The service was amazing. They were kind and helpful. The upstairs has a small quiet seating area where you can watch them make their freshly squeezed orange juice. Loved my visit I would go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal. I like the option to eat at the restaurant or have more casual dining downstairs. I had a salad which was delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is a great option for fast, good quality Italian eats in this neighbourhood. Grab a panini and take it to Trinity Bellwoods Park, or enjoy the quiet seating area upstairs. Their pizzas are made fresh, with interesting topping combinations and generous portion sizes. You can't go wrong with their classic prosciutto sandwich. They always have interesting veggie side dishes and salads too. Of course, the sweets and baked goods are amazing, and I have also tried some of their breads to take home. The presentation is really nice too. Food is served on a wooden tray (which also makes it easy to bring stuff upstairs). Service is usually efficient and warm. I come here when I don't have time for a sit down meal, but want something more than the typical grab and go options from other cafes/take out spots."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon looking for a donut. Success! We tried the bomboloni, which is pastry filled with either cream or nutella. Very delicious (although expensive, I think around $3.50 for the large size). 

The Interior is really nice and has a cool vibe, was pretty busy. Happy to have found this place, both for gourmet donuts downtown and maybe for lunch or dinner another time!"}
{"text":"Right by the Terroni on Queen West, this beautiful, newly opened Italian bakery is everything great that the Terroni brand represents. They of course sell espresso drinks, panini, pizza, pastries, bread, cakes, chocolate and gelato. We sat by the window bar drinking our delicious espresso, and I felt relaxed and taken away by memories of Italy. Tried some of their pastries and they were excellent too (too bad I couldn't try them all). Would love to come back for lunch sometime. Even the floor tile is beautiful!"}
{"text":"I took my two friends here for a birthday dinner and called before dinner to see if the restaurant can write a happy birthday message when we order dessert (many restaurants do this - write it on the plate with chocolate sauce). And at the beginning they said yes, but then called me back and said they can't because they don't have the utensils to do so...Anyway, no biggie, they said they can put a candle on the dessert which works for me. So by the end of the meal, we ordered dessert  and there was no candle!!! They had completely forgotten about it!!! I also ordered a pear nectar as my drink when I got there and was given a peach nectar...I could have said something but didn't want to waste the drink that was already opened (it comes in a bottle).

Food wise, we ordered a bunch of food to share. The Cacio e Pera salad was really bitter. The pork chop was not cooked fully and we had to send the piece close to the bones back to the kitchen. The N'Dujana pizza was not bad - make sure your spread the n'duja on the pizza for flavour. The Saccoccia was good. The tiramisu for dessert was the best out of the whole meal.

Overall experience was not that pleasant, probably won't come back for the restaurant, but might come back to try the bakery."}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends for coffee and snacks earlier today. It was my first time coming here but my friends have been before. What a cute place! 

Upon walking in, there is a long display case of several delicious looking fresh pastries, cookies, donuts, and around 5 different flatbreads. So many yummy looking choices that it was hard to decide what to get! I settled on a latte, pistachio candied orange cannoli and nutella with cream bombolone (donut) this time. I didn't regret any of these fresh and flavourful choices! My friends each got a flatbread slice: one with sausage and the other with mushrooms. I tried samples of each of these downstairs and they were good but I didn't  feel like having a large slice of flatbread before dinner at the time. I can see why this place is so well rated!

Upstairs, there is a long communal table to sit at and a patio with seats too. Most people seem to get take out from here though and the line up was continuous, even around 6:30 pm! Staff were polite and efficient at taking and filling orders though. I enjoyed my experience here and will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend works here and she recommended this place! There's store made gelato, coffee, baked goods, pizza and more!

The interior was nice and it had a very casual atmosphere. There's a bench to sit outside in front of the store and a table you can slide out in front of the bench. There is also an upstairs area and a patio out back. I was a bit confused on how to get there since I had to go through a work space a few employees were in. One of them noticed my confused look and said it was okay to go through.

The patio was small and cute but my favourite place is the seats on the main floor by the windows which can open up. I was sitting there eating my baked good and sipping on an iced latte while watching cars and people go by on Queen Street W.

The food is a bit pricy but it was delicious! I was amazed by the quality of the ingredients and how tasty and sweet it was in my mouth."}
{"text":"Really great croissants and croissant sandwiches! Loved the pistachio cannoli. Would have liked some milk options for espresso drinks. (Lactose intolerant)"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot if you want to grab a slice of pizza, sandwich or some salad. I met a friend here for lunch and it was super packed on a Saturday afternoon so don't expect to easily find seats! They have a seating upstairs for customers who want to sit down. My friend and I split a sandwich: Panino alla Norma which had eggplant, ricotta, tomato, basil, and a pizza slice: Farcita all'Erbe - white pizza stuffed with braised rapini and dandelion. Both were really good! We finished our meals with a cannoli which was super tasty. 

Overall I'll definitely be back here to try more great foods. The vibe is nice if you're just popping in for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this cafe/bakery - quick lunch for those just passing by or on their lunch break. From their assorted salads, sandwiches, pastas, pizzas and desserts - there's plenty of options. You grab a tray and make your round! They have combo options for those who like different things. 

We loved their string bean salad with tomatoes and the flatbread with prosciutto. The flatbread was toasted to warm and full of flavor. The string bean salad was also addicting - nomnomnom. 

They have a separate dining area for those that are looking to order off a menu vs. picking their food through a glass. It was pretty packed for that so we weren't able to do the waiter service.

GET THE NUTELLA BOMBES. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee with delicious pastries. The decor is beautiful as well. One of my regular spots for coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"Went over there for lunch based on recommendation from a friend.  

Food: I ordered a salami sandwich ($9) and a fruit tart ($3).  Both of them were delicious and were presented really well.  They were served on simple yet fancy wooden treys. 
A friend ordered two pizza slices (combined $9.50), they were cut into half and placed in arts way on the wooden treys.  He confirmed they were good.
All the food had fresh ingredients: salad in the sandwich, greens on the pizza, fresh fruit on fruit tart.

Locale: When you walk in you get the feeling of a proper bakery.  The fresh smell of dough is present.  By the prices you know the place is upper scale. They have seating upstairs (but I did not go there).  We sat on the bar facing outside.  

Extra notes:  Half way through the meal, we realized we had to go to a meeting, and the staff was happy to pack the remaining of the food in fancy boxes."}
{"text":"Other than Italian baked goods, Sud Forno also sell a variety of savoury food from pasta to porchetta as well. I only tried their pastry though. A good thing about Sud Forno is that if you are on a budget/diet, they also offer miniature version for some of their pastries as well. 

-Cannoli:  It had a crispy shell filled with sweet ricotta and lovely hint of citrus from the candied orange.

-Bombolone with nutella - $3: Fluffy pillows of rich and tender fried pastry dough rolled in sugar and filled with nutella pastry cream -yummmmm

-Sfogliatelle  - $3.8: The crunch and crackle of the pastry layers was beautifully contrasted by the smoothness and creaminess of the filling. The sfogliatelle was not too sweet and just simply irresistible.

-Cannella (cinnamon and custard pastry cream) - $3.50: There was just a lovely hint of cinnamon with a not too sweet pastry cream filling. I normally don't like cinnamon in pastry and I'm glad the staff convinced me to get this!"}
{"text":"Super cool and unique interior with very friendly staff. All the Italians and decores give off a very vintage-y European vibe - not something you see every day in Toronto.

I tried some of their pastries and a green tea. Grean tea was averaged, and overpriced - I think it was around $5 for a small cup. Pastries were not as sweet as I expected them to be, sweet still, but not to the point where I reach for a sip of water after every bite. Bravo for Italian pastry. Price is also on the higher end, but it's a selection you won't find elsewhere. 

Unfortunately I visited Forno after lunch. The pizzas smelled amazing so I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Only had the donuts, but will be back to try other things. Donuts were okay, wish there was more filling. The nub of filling at the top of the donut is basically it.

The space is very nice and has a huge communal wooden table upstairs. Tho the upstairs kinda feels like a storage room, where theres just a bunch of boxes on one side and random signs leaning against the wall."}
{"text":"When in Toronto, go here. I wasn't sure if I was in Italy or Canada as they have great Italian dishes and pasta. They actually have a DJ spinning tracks while you eat lunch. They have a fresh buffet or food to order. We had the marinara pasta, cole slaw, and salads and I really liked the strong espresso. Great place to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ah overwhelming when you walk in to order because there are tooooo many delicious baked goods on display. Large variety of coffee, tea, pastries, salads, and pizzas. They kind of have everything here! 
As far as seating goes, there's one long communal table upstairs that can get crowded. But if you find a spot it's a great place to do work or read. Theres also a small bar of seats by the window downstairs, and overall its a very beautiful space."}
{"text":"We were walking along Queen Street looking for a place to snack on some sweet treats. When we walked past this store, it caught our eye since we don't eat too many Italian sweets. Even though they sell a variety of foods from savoury to sweet, we only tried 4 types of sweet treats. The price was really good because it was just $10 for all these sweets.

They were all interesting and pretty tasty. My favourite was the nutella filled bambalone, it was like eating a fluffy donut with a nutella filling. I like the carpet of dessert we got because it ranged from crunchy dry to sweet and creamy. From like chocolate and nutella to fruit and creamy. I dont think it's anything out of the ordinary, but it was decent and what I'd expect.

It's hard to compare to other Italian places because I don't go too many Italian places and try their sweets. I usually just have the pasta or entrees at Italian places. But coming to Sud forno makes me want to try the sweets at all the other places.

I'll definitely come back and try the other sweets and meals they serve here.

The environment is really nice, the staff is polite and they have an upstairs area where you can sit and lounge around for a while!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here....I ordered a short rib pasta dish and it was a hefty 25 dollars with a tiny wizy peice of meat (like 3 cm by 2 cm and 1 cm thick) with pasta tossed with tomatoe sauce...

My gin cocktail had a basil garnish that was part black/dry and wilted, seriously that's a 13 dollars drink?

The atmosphere was nice though, service was okay too but the food is not worth it for the money."}
{"text":"I came here for a chill solo dinner Saturday night hoping to find a quiet atmosphere with great food where I could get some reading done. Their up stairs with the big communal table was perfect for me (although the wooden stools aren't the most comfortable seats). The playlist was a fun mix of oldies but goodies at the perfect volume level.

I had the Torta Salata with the small Beet Salad combo for $8 which was really an amazing deal. The \"small\" Salad was very generous and I was super satisfied. The Torta Salata was excellent!! The thin crispy layers of squash on top with the creamy ricotta and spinach were absolutely delicious. I recommend you ask for it to be heated up.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and I will definitely come back with friends to try the nutella and custard doughnuts! The only bummer for me was the lack of WiFi but this place still gets a 5/5 from me as a hang out/chill cafe, just not a study cafe."}
{"text":"Great espresso and an extremely enticing selection of fresh baked Italian pastries. Stopped by after dinner one evening and just ordered a macchiato and some mini bombe. The pastries were light, fresh and fluffy, and I couldn't resist taking a couple of slices of pizza home for breakfast. Let me tell you, that did not disappoint. I'm definitely going to make my way back."}
{"text":"You will easily be drawn into Sud Forno by their amazing display of pastries and sandwiches. You will not be disappointed. The pizza is a must try! Bread is phenomenal. There is a quiet seating area on the second floor and an outdoor patio (ventilation outside can be bothersome)"}
{"text":"Cash registers closed 22 minutes ahead of official closing hours. No reason provided by employees, quote \"cash closed\"."}
{"text":"Great meatballs with lots of flavor! Coffee is always good as well. 

Really enjoy the atmosphere as well as the queen location which I feel is slightly more authentic"}
{"text":"imo, dineen across the street is one of the most beautiful cafes in toronto, but sud forno gives it a real run of its money. that's saying a lot. the space is airy, bright and pleasantly appointed. 

the coffee and pastries are well made. like many others have said, you must try the bomboloni, but the other bake goods are delicious too.

personally, i think the food is a great value. it's thoughtful, fresh and capably executed. for example, porchetta, carmelized onions with a poached egg on a fresh croissant... if you can pull it off, there's really not much better than that for breakfast. 

it's mostly self-serve, but service is still friendly and attentive. 

sud forno is a gift to the financial district."}
{"text":"This is the most happening place for anything coffee to any thing food related. I came here for an iced caramel macchiato which was off the hook. The crowd is swanky, business professionals, to hit ballerinas, cool vibe, great energy during lunch time--I am definitely going to come back here to try their desserts and pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible customer service. The place is run by teenagers who need a lesson in basic courtesy. Too bad, cause otherwise food selection is decent and ambience is hip"}
{"text":"Overpriced, confusing service and not enough food options. 

Met my boyfriend here after work, and there were very few options at the salad and sandwich bar. Apparently they close the salad and sandwich bar at 6pm. We asked if we could order bread with cold cuts and cheese, and were told to go to the bar. We went to the bar to order a drink and the bread with sides, and were turned rudely away - apparently you have to find a table then wait for a server. So darn confusing! Why so hard to order a bite and a drink?! 

We sat down and ordered drinks, but bread plus sides is not an option available - though you do get a small platter with bread, pizza and cheese if you order a drink. Mind you, it's a tiny portion. 

After our stop here we went across the street for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Too pricey! For my Italian desserts I normally go to Tre Mari, but I had heard good things about Sud Forno, so I gave them a try. I could not believe the price of a mini baba - it was the same price of a large one at Tre Mari. Seriously? I spent $26 on desserts that would have cost me $15 at another bakery. That said, the desserts, except for the $7+ one that came in the jar (rip off), were tasty. Though tasty, they are not worth another visit."}
{"text":"This place is a nice change up if you're looking for something a little unique and different from the usual coffee spots on Queen West. 

I ordered an Earl Grey and a \"cornetta\" (I believe it was called) which is like an Italian version of a croissant. The Earl Grey was wonderful! I can't remember the name of the tea company but it was really caramelly and rich, just as it was described on the tea menu. The cornetta was very big and pretty yummy. The only problem was that I ordered it \"for here\" and it was served on a little wooden cutting board lined with a napkin. I thought it was a very cute presentation but the cornetta was almost bigger than the little board and was not a practical serving device at all for a flaky and crumbly pastry like that. There are lots of nice food offerings including pizza and pre-made salads, and gelato! I'd like to try something else next time. 

The staff are pretty new and are learning, which is nice, but there was someone in the back area near the pizza counter talking very loudly; sounded like they were training a new team member. It was kind of unpleasant to hear about all the procedures and rules about the job... It took away the illusion of a seamless bakery business the way a theatre performance would be ruined if you saw the dirty tricks behind the scenes... It wouldn't be so impressive after that. 

It was nice, but I might just take my Earl Grey to go next time, or skip it altogether and head to my usual spot where I can sit comfortably and undisturbed."}
{"text":"Stopped here one night in search of Cannoli's after a recent trip to NYC. My fiancée has the most ridiculous sweet tooth so we basically stop into anything bakery related. Got some Cannoli's, a Tiramisu, and a double long espresso. Ate at the bench table upstairs.. was pretty quiet. Cannoli itself was a bit moist, and wasn't as crisp and crunchy as I would've liked. The filling was decent but a bit too heavy for my liking. Tiramisu was a cake style, and average. Not the best, but certainly could've been a lot worse."}
{"text":"I go to SUD regularly because of the amazing food (seriously the bombolones and pizza are no joke). 

Every time I go we are always greeted with the nicest staff. They are always pleasant and happy!

The upstairs has a beautiful long wooden communal table to sit at which is quite nice or a few seats at the front window. 

It is my neighbourhood spot and easily one of my favourites in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Lots of options from pizza to salad to dessert. Good spot for a quick bite or dessert. You must try the bombolinis they are THE BEST. It's a great spot to hop over to especially if Dineen cafe is packed."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. The service could use some work.

We went for a sit down lunch in the upstairs restaurant as opposed to the quick service portion on the lower level. The server greeted us nicely enough and brought drinks out right away. She then read us the specials. Listing the ingredients of each item. I ended up ordering the pizza on special. I asked to have honey drizzled on it. She said she would have to check as they don't make substitutions. I said, just bring me a side of honey and I will add it myself. Problem solved (she could have offered this solution herself, but obviously that was too complicated for her brain to handle.) 

The Pizza arrived with prosciutto on it. Which would be fine if I had been told it had meat on it. I did not want meat on my pizza. This was surprising because she went to great lengths to explain to my dining companion that another pizza they ordered came with meat and to make sure they were ok with that. Ugh. My companions ate the meat off my pizza and I did enjoy the rest, but still very disappointed about being misled.

The servings are quick large (but I would say adequate given the price). The pizza was delicious despite the miscommunication in ordering. I felt it could have used some chilli oil or fresh parm to liven it up but none were offered and I did not ask.

Dessert was a cannoli and truly it was divine. I also tried to order a vanilla cream tea to go with the cannoli, but shortly after we ordered, the server advised that they were all out and offered a different flavour of tea instead. Not what I wanted but ok. Again just another disappointment.

So the rocky service makes this place loose points. Especially if servers do not advise on what is in the food they are serving. The food was delicious, and perhaps the quick service area on the ground floor is the way to go here. But the sit down restaurant service on the second floor is not up to the standard of the price point charged. I will not be back."}
{"text":"considering the reviews that this place gets, I'm disappoi yed by the quality and service of this place. everything is too expensive in my opinion. I've given this place 3 tries and pretry sure i don't like it. I tried their bombolino (both nutella and custard filled pastries), almond croissant, and their fruit cake - they didn't taste special or superb; rather the taste was meh.  Each time i went there I felt pressured to buy something the staff was eyeing me as i walked up and down the store looking at the baked good and their pizza + pasta stations"}
{"text":"The newest addition to the Terroni family had me at the first moment I walked in.  Terroni spared no expense on creating this gorgeous restaurant, market, bakery, espresso & wine bar, and fast casual eatery.  Yes, it's all that... and more.  

This place is 2 levels and it exudes a modern luxury vibe with so many natural details... large caramel wooden paneling cover the walls, thick leather straps holding the unique light fixtures that look almost vine like in their twists and turns along the wall, more gleaming wood details arching overhead the main floor area, and the incredible wall of bread loaves all with perfectly made darkened ears.  Even check out the floor with it's cute tiled mosaics ... I liked the one that says Amore.  I could do so many shots and each instagram worthy.  

The main floor has many tables to allow people to grab a quick bite from the main floor.  The bar seating is generous for any wine & snacks before dinner or an cappuccino and sweet bite in the morning.  The central area is mostly glass cases showcasing plated food that all look delicious... fresh figs and proscuitto salad? or freshly made pizza slices? or their own 'nutella' filled bombolone (aka great doughnuts)?  It's all here for you.  

I came here to mainly eat upstairs in their new restaurant ... I've been to a few Terroni and I love this place.  The table spacing is generous compared to other Terroni (No bumping into other tables) and since it wasn't quite filled like their other places, kitchen pacing and service was great.  Usually other Terroni places are a fun, loud, and more laid back casual spot, I would say Da Geppetto (the 2nd floor) is their cooler, more refined, affluent, and worldly cousin.  

As mentioned, service here is great... in addition to our designated server, we had 2 table runners and people who just cleared the dishes and provide new cutlery with each course.  Sud Forno menu still has all the pasta and pizza that other Terroni focuses on but they also have a lot more antipasto and secondi.  

Bread Basket - Don't turn down the bread basket!  See those delicious looking loaves downstairs?  You get a generous helping (and offers of seconds!) of these with their Terroni olive oil (which is very herbal and peppery but great).  The bread here is delicious... perfect crunch to the crust and flavour while giving way to a soft large pocketed interior.  For all those who hasn't dine before at Terroni... don't ask for balsamic vinegar with your olive oil  4/5 

U Pesce Frit (fried cod) - 4 medium slices of cod filets were plated nicely along side several vibrantly coloured pickled vegetables.  I normally wouldnt have thought to pair pickled vegetables with the cod but I loved it as the spiced acidity pairs nicely against the hot crispy  fried yeast on the fish.  The texture of the crust was so close to tempura like in it's lightness and crispiness.  The tomato sauce was a nice addition as well to give it another hit of flavour.  It is on the pricer side for an antipasto but it is well done  4/5

Cartoccio di Dentice (red snapper & seafood in parchment) - A generous amount of mussels, clams and a large piece of squid added to the snapper and many cherry tomatoes.  The steaming process released all the nice shellfish juices to make the sauce.  I feel the squid a bit on the rubbery side and the mussels weren't very meaty but I think the red snapper was tender and loved it paired with the tomatoes.  I would have loved to have more of the herbs thrown in as I felt the mussel and clams didnt add enough brininess or flavour 3.5/5

Filetto in Crosta di Pane (filet mignon) - This was delicious ... I normally don't eat steak but I was wondering if a carnivore could part with more than one piece of this.  In addition to being perfectly cooked medium rare and being tender, they added a gorgonzola topping that added such a huge flavour hit.  It was salty with the right bit of blue cheese bite that paired so amazing with the beef.  The prosciutto crisps just put this over the top   4.5/5

Cappuccino - I did ask if the had alternative milk and their answer (true to Terroni style) was that they only had whole milk.  I recently had some amazing old school Italian style espresso drinks in the USA and I've been dying to find it again in Toronto.  Bold, rich, and smooth... This is the best in the area... better than Dineen 4/5

Assorted selection of sweets from bakery downstairs - In our selection, we had fruit tart, baba rhum, nutella bombolone, vanilla bombolone, and cannoli with a bit of fruit. The fruit tart had a buttery crust that was delicious.  The nutella bombolone is a chocolate-holic dream.  And the cannoli is super crisp, light, and not overly sweet.  Perfect ending with a lot of different flavours to try and indulge.  4/5

Even though it is only less than 2 weeks old, it doesnt show it.  Simply said ... Fantastico!"}
{"text":"Part of the Terroni family of restaurants, Sud Forno is their bakery cafe that offers really good Italian classics.  It could be as simple as a rich and smooth cappuccino, crispy shelled and perfectly lightly sweet cannoli, or a nice slice of pizza.  

Just one caveat ... Terroni comes with a particular mindset (or attitude depending on who you talk to).  They believe their experience and expertise makes them understand how best to treat their ingredients to give you the best tasting bite... aka.  NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING.  I know a lot of people have 'eye rolled' so hard on this that they can see back of the head.  Personally, I treat restaurants like someone who is an artist.  If they feel completely passionate about it... I'll definitely try it their way first.  After that, I can make my own decision to agree or disagree.  

As for the store... check out the floor.  No really.  It's really quite a beautiful mosaic and that attention to detail is really echoed in all the rest of the store.  Clean lines, warm wood tones, lots of great looking baked goods and hearth style breads.  Service here was good for us... quick and efficient.  We didnt get any attitude.  

Cappuccino - Note: There are no alternative milk at all ... none.  It's part of their mindset to not offer it.  I am not deathly lactose intolerant.  I can handle it in occasional and small doses.  Seeing how I was dying for a coffee drink and this was the only thing opened late nearby, I decided to get it.  And ... yes... delicious.  Smooth and bold.  I remember why I liked cow's milk texture in espresso based drink now.  Just too bad I can't have this too often.  4/5

Tart with berries - This was quite amazing... I think there was more berries and jam than actual tart.  It wasn't blindingly sweet... a nice fruit flavour.  A touch tart but sweet.  Nice snack between meals.  4/5

Italian cookie with Pistachios - Oh I liked this.  Cute little bite of light nuttiness.  I would say that this was the lightest in flavour but it had a great tender texture.  3.5/5

Cannoli - I was kinda worried about buying this since it was the evening and I know pre-filled cannoli are 90% terrible.  These ones were really good.  Crispy shells that break easily to the creamy smooth filling that has notes of sweetness and citrus.  4.5/5

Espresso Caramel cookie - If you love coffee flavour, GET THIS.  Honestly one of the best cookies I've had all year.  Strong and delicious coffee flavour that gives way to a deep caramel note.  The cookie itself was crisp on the edges but tender in the middle.  Might be my perfect cookie 5/5

As for me disagreeing or agreeing with Terroni's mindset of 'their way' & their choice of offering no alternative milks... yeah, I agree it is good tasting.  Maybe they do know what's best for their ingredients ... especially with the cannoli & espresso caramel cookie."}
{"text":"Went in for work lunch with colleagues and found out Sud was in fact a sister concern of Terroni. The menu has resemblance but the pizza selection is not as extensive as Terroni. The decor is not as rustic as the old court house location of Terroni east of Yonge, but rather had a more polished professional look for a Italian eatery. Easy to see this is to to cater to the Bay St lunch crowd. Service was prompt and to the point. The first floor is more of a café and bakery while the second is more for sit in dining. Reserve ahead if you are a bigger group of 4 or more during lunch hour. I ordered the \"ravioli di granchio\" which is essentially crab stuffed ravioli in an EVO based white cream sauce with wilted spinach, capers and black fish eggs. My order had four large raviolis and you can tell they were hand crafted. Cooked to perfection and the quantity was perfect for a light lunch. Will be back here for the coffee and bakery goodies next time. Arrivederci Sud Forno!"}
{"text":"Great concept. Lovely staff, great food options and cool bar. Definitely want to come back here with friends. Such a sweet friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"Delicious! Sometimes a bit busy during lunch and can be a bit confusing at the cash but the food is fresh and authentic Italian cuisine. Coffee is good. A bit pricy for what it is but it's downtown so location plays a role."}
{"text":"Great pizza for vegetarians! That's all we need to know because we anyways struggle to find good food!! We have 4 amazing options for pizzas and all of them are delicious! I also got a couple of Italian desserts like sfogliatelle and millefeuille which could have been better and thus 4 stars! But given a chance I would definitely visit again for the great pizza that they have!!"}
{"text":"Came here just before lunch time and there were fairly a good amount of people. The way this place works was a bit confusing but you will get the jist of it just watching how people worked. I went to pizza/bread section and got a slice of margarita pizza and they have me an interesting piece of wood with a number on it. I also got a Nutella bombolone, which is what they are featured for and was given another number. I paid at the cash and since there was no space, I asked if they offered space upstairs but they said it was for a restaurant and so they let me sit in their VIP room since it wasn't in use. Overall, I had a good experience, good service and that the food was well prepared but quite pricey. The VIP room was really pretty, great natural lighting and very roomy. I'd come back again!!"}
{"text":"Sud Forno is a classic Italian bakery with a slightly upscale look and feel. I came to check them out after weeks of curiosity and they didn't disappoint. It was very busy around the noon hour, with quite a lineup forming near the entrance. There were many staff on hand and everything was orderly and under control. They're really polite and helpful.

I was saving my hunger for afterwards, so I only tried the gelato. It had an awesome flavour and texture to it. I'd have it again and again.

The pastries, sandwiches, coffee, and everything else they serve here looks enticing. This a great additon to the strip of businesses on Queen West in the Trinity Bellwoods hood."}
{"text":"I've been to sud forno a few times, usually during the work day to peruse the wide range of offerings. Normally I grab a croissant or bambolini... Nothing fantastic and once the pastry was actually pretty stale. 

However this time I went to get an afternoon slice of pizza, the mushroom one in particular as I've been eyeing it for some time. They warmed it up for me as I had to take it back to the office. When I finally got to try it out, I was met with disappointment. Fairly tasteless and bland, I actually felt pretty sick after. 

One day I might try the food there, but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"A perfect Italian lunch spot. Pastries are delicious and premium quality but too pricy for what you get. I'd come here again for lunch. They have sandwiches and pizza slices. Seating upstairs. A bit chaotic ordering system though. Overall:

CHEAP LUNCHES
PRICEY DESSERTS"}
{"text":"Lovely cafe/bakery joint that seems to be part of terrroni. Tried their small donuts which were amazing! Was expecting dense typical donut consistency but was airy yet rich with cream inside. Would return to try their other baked goodies! They also sell La Colombe coffee those who are fan of the philly coffee"}
{"text":"I love the set up of Sud Forno. The interior is spacious with high ceilings. Tons of windows at the front of the restaurant a good place to have coffee and meet up with friends.

Cappuccino and Mini Bombe! Perfect combinations as a snack anytime of the day. But anything tasted good with a generous filling of nutella?

The experience though is on the pricier side. $8 for that privilege. You do pay for the location which is right in Downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Sud Forno is a brand new bakery that opens by Terroni. 

I have no idea that it is that new as it just opened around 2 weeks ago!

Walking by I saw all these artisan bread and pastries and I could not resist walking and get myself some treats!!

Biscotti and some cookies for 25 cents and some other pastries are priced individually. There is also pizza squares if you want to have a quick bite!

Staff is super nice and helpful. Since most of their baked goods does not have description and pricing on them, I have to ask quite a lot of question before I decided on what I want!

There are a few seating downstairs facing Queen Street and upstairs there is also a large communal table that can fit 10 people+!

Opens from 8 am - 11 pm, so great option to drop by for a coffee and a snack!!"}
{"text":"Mangia Mangia this! After making a reservation for the Friday date night, we were seated upstairs in the 'off the menu' restaurant section upstairs. The server, Kristi was really good and made sure we got our water, bread and menus right away. 

We ordered the Calabrisella pizza $19 and the Spaghetti alla Carbonara $18

The pizza has tomato sauce, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, parmigiano, n'duja and great basil. It was light and crispy on the bottom- just the way I like it! No, just the way I love it!!

The Spaghetti Alla Carbonara had the perfect guanciale. It was unlike any other that I have tasted before. The waitress said they cute it in-house so wow is me, I can't snack on it this Christmas by the fireplace that I also don't have! 

We paid our bill and went downstairs to partake in the stare-at-the-deserts experience. They have all these mouth watering things staring you in the face and the butterscotch budino reached out, grabbed me and said, 'EAT ME' ....so I did! Damn did I eat it ....every last drop! 

To end, a macchiato for me and an espresso for the lady in those thick nuovo pointe cups! If you go to Dineen for coffee, you might as well stop and just get it from here! Five stars, deserved every one and we are going back!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite spots in Toronto for coffee and snacks. Their sandwiches and pizza are incredible. They're simple, but full of flavour. I'd suggest the Classico or the sandwich with prosciutto and hard boiled egg! Top anything off with a bit of their hot sauce too."}
{"text":"So delicious. Visiting Toronto and we stopped in for gelato based on yelp reviews. Ice cream was amazing and the double chocolate Nutella biscotti were INCREDIBLE. Took 4 to-go. Definitely will be back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I tried to get a table here for lunch, but it was so busy. The main floor offers serve-yourself dining while the upper floors offers regular dining. Instead of having lunch here, I came back for dessert.

Unfortunately the line for desserts is also the same line for cashing out, so while you're ready to pay, you may get stuck behind someone ordering dessert. There were so many things to choose from. I ordered a nutella crostata to go. It definitely had that distinguishable nutella taste to it. The tart/pie part was tasty but a little bit dense.

I'll have to come back for lunch and try some of their other desserts."}
{"text":"Sud Forno has a nice charm to it, great food and little hectic ordering and seating process. 

For a quick bite this place is great. Light sandwiches and pizzas will satisfy your taste buds, but probably not your hunger. I am a fan of the pizza; crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce and a good variety of toppings. 

Their demise is the service. And its not all down to the staff, it lies in the design of the place. No real lineup or way to the cash, its more of a free for all to order. But this doesn't completely take away from the whole experience.

Oh, but don't buy the bread, unless you're a millionaire. I know its good and all, but close to $10 for a loaf?"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their pastries!! 

Really pretty place once you step inside. You are surrounded by pastries and the smell of something baking and coffee brewing the moment you inhale. 

I ordered takeout to try some pastries at home. I ordered an almond crème filled croissant and another flaky pasty with vanilla cream inside. I also ordered a small bottle of tiramisu. This cafe/restaurant is definitely a cute place to hang out but the pastries were mediocre. The flaky pastry I brought home was hard and not crispy at all. When I bit into the pastries, I didn't feel the freshness of the pastries where I get the soft textures and the chewiness of the pastries. Tiramisu tasted alright but wasn't anything that I wasn't expecting. 

LAST TIP?!

Maybe the pastries will taste better if eaten in the shop. I would suggest asking which ones are freshly out of the oven so you can be a judge yourself!"}
{"text":"After trying this place I can tell for sure: i had the worst pignolli cookies I could possible think of.
Dry. Hard. No almond paste at all. Did I mention dry? Expensive.
I had pignolis and their \"gelatto\". Both made me think \"WTFH THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN MIND?\"
Veeeeeeeeerrrreryyyyyyyy overrated and overpriced. If you feel like payin close to 9 dolars for 4 \"pignollis\" and a ball of a sugar free gelato, be their guest."}
{"text":"Overpriced average food. I wasn't expecting to spend $18 for a small portion of pasta and a slice of pizza. The decor is really nice but this isn't really worth it in my opinion. The location offers a lot more palatable options at that price point. 

I wouldn't come here again for lunch but maybe I'll drop by for their bread and pastries."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch on a nice day on Queen st. Didn't get to try any of the pastries (nutella donuts) or pizza, but it all looked amazing. We went for the flatbread sandwiches next to the pizzas with prosciutto and arugula. Similar style to the sandwiches in florence! 

The only downside was I couldn't find a menu with everything they offered. Behind the pizza counter was a huge pork butt of porcetta for making sandwiches and if I didn't ask about it I wouldn't have known. 

Overall the place has a nice cafe type feel and the authenticity is def present in the food. I'll have to come back to try their pizza and pastry."}
{"text":"It's a cute place to grab a nice coffee or a snack, but it's kind of annoying when you want a milk substitute and they can't offer that? They don't even have lactose free milk! They don't make any specialty coffees either. 

For lunch I had the quiche, which was very tasty. However, I also had the rapini salad and it was overly salted that I could only take 3 bites. My friend had an eggplant lasagna and it was extremely salty. 

Overall, it's nice, great for a quick in and out coffee, but don't come here if you want specialty coffee or have any milk restrictions. Very disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"Strictly on the gelato alone this would have been 5/5 for me. Authentic Italian gelato with the right texture; I tried the nocciola (hazelnut) flavour. Small cup for ~$4 - yum!

However, couldn't find the price for anything in this store which was a tad annoying and the employees were too busy cleaning up to provide better service. Would also skip pastry items as I saw a couple of fruit flies. Just come and get the gelato!"}
{"text":"First time here for a birthday party, unfortunately, I've never had any of their pastries, other than the small doughnut I got for dessert - which was simple and delicious. 

The main I got to was their Tonnarelli All'astice, it was extremely hard pronouncing that name to the waitress, clearly , I'm not Italian lol.  I honestly think the food was great, it was super simple but brought out all the natural flavors of the ingredients, the sweetness from the fresh lobster to the slightly tanginess or the cherry tomatoes, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 

To be fair, the reason for the 4 start is because I think the value for my money isn't there. It's on the pricy side for the whole experience."}
{"text":"Past this place a few times when most of their pastries had sol out.
Finally today I stopped by when it was still full.
Wholly chaotic. Everyone walks in and wants to browse the counter of what's in store - I did the same until one gal kept asking about a line.. She looked kinda stressed. 
Despite all this the staff are very patient and helpful and friendly. Everything looked so good. 
But as my usual, I had to test out their almond croissant. It was cut in half and there was a filling. I must say it was pretty good, though not what I was expecting. I can't really compare it to my fav a.c @ cherry bomb. The filling is actually like a cake. The texture intrigued me. Quite delicious. The right amount of sweetness without over doing it. It had the right flakiness on the outside and soft in the middle. Not as moist nor chewy as cherry bombs but I wouldn't call it dry. Almond croissant would be a 7.5-8.5/10 ( cherry bomb is a 10). 
Any hoots , got some pasta salad as well - so yum! And what I like the most is the home made pasta. Right density and flavor. 
It's a great place to stop by and have a snack or a quick lunch to go. It's great there are still a few seats if you want to say in. 
If I'm in the area and wanting a quick bite - I'd stop here again... Seems there's just so much things to select from I'd try something new. Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally found some good Italian food in Toronto. Everything is great about the place. The food, the atmosphere, and the people working there. 

I have been trying to find a parmigiana and finally found one that taste like Italy!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice now, the first time food was delicious. However this time, I got a bomboloni and it was definately not fresh. The taste was stale and day old. I had a fresh one last time and it was light and fluffy, not impressed with my second visit."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for little European shops with walls of groceries and delicious premade treats, so naturally the Italian goodness at Sud Forno stole my heart.

I popped in with my fam on a Saturday and grabbed some sandwiches, sweets and fresh pasta as groceries. I will be back for olive oil, pizza squares, espresso and more cuteness soon. 

Watching your wallet? Unlike more casual, similar shops, Sud Forno is quite pricy."}
{"text":"Was walking by one night with my fiancé and it was one of the few cafes opened on Canada day. I ordered a pistachio gelato. It was so tasty we ended up staying and had a few more pastries. It was delicious! Even though it was late at night, I expected them to taste stale. But it was fresh!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  I had a dream about a place like this here for years and its walkable from my office.  Time permitting i may become a regular.  Its super high quality ready made food with classic Italian flavour.  The space is gorgeous and there is a restaurant upstairs.  I got the Bolognese lasagna and it was delicious.  Satisfied my craving.  I also got the pepperonata.  A nice cooked pepper mix reminded me of my mom.  I got a hazelnut croissant for a snack later.  They had nice salads, pizzas and a bread wall.   My food dreams finally answered.  Only thing better would be if they are open late.  I hope more of these appear around town because its what this city is missing."}
{"text":"Endroit très convivial avec une belle atmosphère.  Beaucoup de choix de nourriture.  Au premier étage, on choisi aux différents comptoirs ce que l'on veut, on paye puis on se choisit une place pour manger.  Seul point négatif: vraiment trop cher."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. They really nail every aspect of a good pastry shop... atmosphere, service, coffee, and food are all spectacular.

I interacted with several of the staff, since I went back and ordered a few different things and they ranged from very nice and professional to outstandingly nice and professional.

Also, the presentation is perfection. They really sweat the details here, and most importantly, the food is sublime. Really gives you a good feeling to be in a place that takes care of you so well."}
{"text":"Lots of options to choose from in the buffet part. Got an eggplant parmesan and it was super yummy but the portion size was not worth the price. 
But to make up for it, the restaurant itself is gorgeous!"}
