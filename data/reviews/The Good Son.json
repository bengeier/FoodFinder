{"text":"PROS: 
Great food, great atmosphere.

CONS: 
-We had reservations at 9:30, didn't get our table until 10pm

-SERVICE WAS EXTREMELY SLOW, didn't get out until 12:30am!!! 

- We had the most UNPROFESSIONAL server ever. His name is DAVE. Upon arrival, we mentioned we would like to be out at 11:30pm as we had to be somewhere else to be at that time. DAVE'S response was \"Not gonna happen!\" And walked away (completely unprofessional). He continued to give attitude ALL night. DAVE also forgot to bring out some drinks that were ordered. When it came time to pay DAVE tried to say only 4 people could use a card to pay with and everyone else had to pay cash (we were a group of 15 celebrating a birthday). At this point it's so late there is hardly anyone in the restaurant. I could possibly understand that \"rule\" if it was prime time for dining and they were trying to save time and get people out quickly, however, this was NOT the case. It had already taken 2.5 hrs to have a meal. Even if, it's 2016! You cannot expect that from your customers.... Especially when no one was made aware of this 'rule' ahead of time. DAVE continued to be extremely unpleasant saying \" Well it's going to take EXTREMELY LONG for me to process this. You all should have known to bring cash.\" I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SERVER TREAT CUSTOMERS SO POORLY!!! 

Overall, GREAT Food-- HORRIBLE SERVICE! Toronto has MANY restaurants with great food and provide exceptional service consistently,...and for that reason I WILL NOT be returning or recommending The Good Son!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here, loved the french toast they had and the breakfast pizza. Our server was great & the place definitely looks different and unique."}
{"text":"New to yelp, i have been writing reviews for all places I love, and this is another one. I love almost everything about this place. The decor is AMAZING!  it's sophisticated, complex and cozy at the same time. So much going on and to look at...I love it. The steak tartare is one of my favorite in town. It's supper garlicky, which I love, but not the best option if you are on a date lol. The steak I had doesn't disappoint, but quite pricey for 12oz. Cocktails are on point too...last time i was soo impressed with a cocktail with beet, thyme and apple brandy that a week had passed and I could still taste it and crave it. My only problem is the inconsistency with service. Sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much. It seems to be getting better though. I come back whenever craving steak tartare and a good cocktail."}
{"text":"We ordered several items to share: A charcuterie and cheese board, apple bacon pizza, chicken liver parfait, organic watercress salad and the oxtail cappelletti. All of these were fantastic, you can't really go wrong with any of them. I will say though, I found the oxtail cappelletti a bit too salty and rich for my liking. As the evening went on, the sauce of the dish became quite thick and heavy.  We also had a dark chocolate gelato for dessert, which was delicious as well.

The restaurant is beautiful decorated and the atmosphere is splendid. The wait staff was wonderful and very accommodating to the allergies of my party (one person severe shellfish and another walnuts). He was also nice enough to take off a few items from our bill as a kind gesture since they didn't have one of the desserts we wanted (and he hadn't realized it wasn't available)"}
{"text":"Have now eaten here four times (twice brunch, twice dinner) and every time it's been fantastic, wowing those I bring. Steak tartare, green bean salad and pizzas are standouts. I live around the corner, and in a neighbourhood full of great and trendy restaurants, this is emerging as one of my favourites."}
{"text":"We went to this place for brunch. I would not call it a traditional breakfast place. Not  many eggy options. I tried the southern deep fried chicken and it was amazing. The French toast smelled great and the taste was ok. Here they have an oven so the pizza is cooked in a wood burn oven and there are few pizza options that come with an egg! Great combination. The service was great. The decorations were a fantastic. Very rustic but clean and cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way out for Christmas shopping and wanted to try out a local restaurant.  I've always wanted to try the Good Son and we were so happy we did.  I love the d√©cor.  The space is bigger than I thought and the chandeliers are fabulous.  
Anyway, the service was impeccable.  Very friendly and attentive.  It was nice the see a list of \"Temperance\" for the DD.  The caramel Sazerac reminded us of our recent trip to New Orleans, so we had to have that.  All our food was very tasty.  We started with the charcuterie board, than our mains were the Sopressata pizza and scallops.  Dessert was pecan pie. 
We will definitely go again and bring along our friends."}
{"text":"Went for brunch yesterday. Service was exemplary. Ordered cocktails to start the day off right.  My son had a drink with Chartreuse. Like a sour that was great.  I had an old Fashioned which was okay.  The ceaser I followed with was exceptional. Shrimp Cocktail in a glass.  

With respect to the food, I had meal envy. The burger was killer and the fries were perfect. The pattie was medium and seasoned well with pickled shallots.  The Eggs Benny was well executed.  

I had wood fired Chorizo, fingerling potatoes and poached eggs. While delicious it just seemed short of something.  A biscuit or toast perhaps would have rounded the dish out.  

We will be back though. All in all good food and a great vibe."}
{"text":"So far, I've been to The Good Son three times: twice for dinner and once for brunch. It's a solid go-to spot.  

The decor is beeeeautiful. I kind of feel like I'm chilling in some well-off collector's fancy library/study: it's relaxed and cozy but not drab or stuffy in the slightest. 

Brunch: 
The eggs benedict is the best I've had -- like, ever. The bacon was crispy (& for another reason I can't quite put my finger on, was hella amazing), the English muffin was fluffy, the poached egg was runny & the hollandaise sauce was creamy - a perfect combination. Definitely recommend! 

I had a slice of my fellow bruncher's breakfast pizza. It was good, but nothing particularly special. I wouldn't order it again myself. 

If you're a fan of Caesars, do not miss out on the Smoky-Red with mezcal. I totally regret not ordering a second round. 

Dinner:
The brussels sprouts are to die for. The hand-cut fries with malt mayo are a surprising stand out. The dinner pizzas are generally great as well: my top favourites of them all is probably the wild mushroom with taleggio & pesto and the spicy sopressata with anaheim chill & sun dried olives. Was underwhelmed by the bulgogi short ribs. 

Excellent for groups and great service.

Make note that The Good Son can often get a bit loud: if you're looking to have some deep convo or catch ups over a meal, this probably isn't the spot to do it."}
{"text":"It was okay ... And that was sort of the problem, hard to justify the prices here for just \"okay\". I went in for brunch, I liked that the restaurant makes use of local ingredients, and I ordered a chicken and waffles which was actually pretty good, with attractive plating. But my friend ordered an eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce was thin, runny and off tasting. Very sour and unappealing. I also ordered a Caesar for my drink, which was almost undrinkable and disgusting, not to mention expensive. While the decor was nice, the service was not so great-- just a very rude and distracted server who broke a glass right next to us and spilled water on our table. She could have been having an off day, but it definitely didn't help the experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place and give it 5 stars but unfortunately my eating experience didn't measure up to my expectations in that both parties' meal were cold. I would love to try it again though because it was a cool dining experience. If my meal had been hot, or even warm I would have given the place a 5. 

The decor and ambiance were fantastic in that the place was awesomely decorated and made for a great dining experience. It has the feeling of an old country style lounge, with leather all over, portraiture on the walls and a wall of old clocks. 

The food was delicious, however when my gf's steak arrived, it was cold, as was my cod. I think this may have something to do with both being served on wood planks as opposed to heated plates. We considered sending both back because they were that cold, however we didn't want to be fussy as it was still delicious. For the price we paid, you would expect more. 

Our server was decently attentive but left my gf's empty plate in front of her for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Chose this place based on Yelp reviews for a rare night out alone with my husband sans kids...and we LOVED it!  There were so many delicious sounding dishes on the menu that we couldn't choose...so we ordered 5 dishes between the two of us :).  The waiter suggested we needed to try everything we were looking at but suggested if we were really worried it would be too much we could lose the ceviche...but we decided to go for it anyway bec we love ceviche! So...we ended up getting: steak tartare, ceviche and jerk shrimp as apps and the octopus and scallops as mains.  YUM!!  My personal faves were the jerk shrimp and scallops but the hubby said he liked the tartare best.  I'd say the waiter was right about the ceviche..a tad underwhelming - could have used a tiny bit of heat to balance the sweetness.  The tartare was really good but very mustard-y.  I thought it would have been nicer with a bit less.  The jerk shrimp was the highlight for me.  Crunchy, salty, sweet, spicy...soooo good!  The octopus was cooked perfectly in their wood oven and had great flavour but the rest of the plate didn't really do much for me.  And finally..the scallops.  For a main I was surprised to see only 2 scallops on the plate but what it lacked in terms of quantity it made up for in taste. The raisins surprisingly added so much to this dish...I only wish there were more scallops! The ambiance and service were great, prices reasonable and food was great!  Will def go back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Honestly, It was a huge DISAPPOINTMENT , we went for sunday brunch 5 of us we ordered the Eggs and Benedict , and all of us got cheesburgers. The Eggs and Benedict was so bland no taste or salt or seasoning the hollandaise sauce is bland it sits on some \"hash potatoe\" wanna be thing and it was gross the salad dressing lemon and sugar !!! and the burgers , were ordered well done since my friend was Preganant she spat out her burger it was so pink not cooked nor were the others. When we told our waiter he looked so nervous he didnt even know what to say they didnt even comp us for anything which you should . Decor does not make the place if the food is crap. left a gross feeling in my stomach wish i could stick my finger down my throat and yaaak. !!!! Harsh but True .. justice is served"}
{"text":"5/5! It has been awhile since I have given the restaurant 5/5- but not surprising since this belongs to chef Vittorio Colacitti (of Top Chef Canada fame), We were told that the decor was inspired by his worldly travels. Pros: we were able to make reservations, the service is great, the cocktail list is unique (I recommend the Run, Tommy, Run), and the food is really good! Food recos as follows: Jerk Shrimp, saarsaparilla side ribs (must have), ash roasted eggplant, wild mushroom pizza and D.O.P. . I have also heard great things about the hamachi crudo - so I will definitely be back to try that. Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Love this resto!
Great spot to being a group of friends to :)
Very trendy atmosphere/decor. 
Great service-- have always been friendly and efficient. 
The food has always been mouth watering. 
I recommend the margarita pizza & salmon entr√©e. 
I wish they would bring the eggplant dip back-- it was beyond delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. I would recommend making a reservation as it was pretty busy around noon. 
The breakfast pizza was just delicious. A bit on the salty side since it is covered in prosciutto but still really good.
The french press coffee is pretty pricey ($5) for the small cup that you get, but it was also really really good.
I liked the batter on the fried chicken that my friend ordered. The waffle was just okay, nothing about it stood out...
I also thought the ricotta cheesecake was really good. Creamy and tasty but not heavy.

Our server was really nice and we did not feel rushed despite sitting there chatting for nearly 3 hours. The two pizzas we ordered came out well after the other 2 entrees (maybe like 15ish minutes after) so that could have been timed better, but I'm just nit picking at this point!

I will definitely come back here, as I want to try the dinner menu too!

The decor in this place is a 10/10 - I loved the look!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for dinner last night (Sunday night). Was ok. Not bad. Nothing special. Shrimp was really good. Soup was ok. Pizza was fine. Ribs were very good. They have a wine special on Sunday's which was nice. Half price for any bottle of wine. Maybe I'll be back. Maybe not."}
{"text":"Situated on queen west by Queen and Dovercourt lies The Good Son.

Once you step inside, the ambience is extremely nice with the vintage decor and the dim lights.¬† Perfect for the hip queen west, yet classy at the same time. It can easily be either a casual place to have drinks or also as a perfect date night. Perfect for groups or couples of all ages.

¬†

The streak tartare is the best I have every had! ¬†Melt in your mouth delicious.¬† The combination of the garlic and onions in which it was marinated with was perfect. The quail egg served on top added additional flavor and was a perfect complement. I have had steak tartare in the south of france and this one was just on par with it!

The guacamole and chips are perfect to much on while you decide what to order.

The margarita pizza, Neapolitan style was delicious. It tasted extremely fresh as it was cooked off the visible wood open stove. ¬†Its will fill you up quite nicely after a few appetizers.


¬†Service was great and definitely a place I will return to in the new future when I am in the queen west area!"}
{"text":"I came here twice for dinner. The food was good, the service was even better (they're very attentive), and the decor, well, that's just something else. No idea where they get their furniture or frames or clocks, but it's like walking into a different era and I'd eat there more often just for their decor and furniture. It's a classy spot without being pretentious. Great spot for an event or simply meeting with friends."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a billion times (literally 1 billion times), and have never been in. Yesterday evening I passed by on the south side of Queen and I saw the beautifully lit room from from across the street and it sang to me.  I literally jaywalked (illegal by the way) and had to go in.  (Here comes the bad part)  I entered and a not so friendly, not very welcoming, less than enthusiastic girl reluctantly \"greeted\" me, now already I had second thoughts, but went with my gut.  Was just going for a drink so wanted to sit at the bar.  I turned left and entered the main dining room and my jaw dropped.  One of the best, most beautifully decorated, best lit, best sounding rooms I've seen in the city.  Like absolutely gorgeous.  Bartender was 10/10, went over and above, really friendly, super knowledgeable, overall just exactly who you want running the bar, and an extraordinarily good dude.  While I didn't eat, I did snoop everyone's meals, and they looked and smelled top notch.  The Good Son literally made my evening, what a phenomenal experience.  I can't believe I've been passing it by for all this time.  This has instantly become one of my new go to's!  Don't be like old me, don't pass this place by."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! The service is always friendly, atmosphere is perfect, and food never disappoints. Tried out this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. Super hipster decor so it fits right in with the ossington strip. 

Because of it's amazing review, decided to order the jerk shrimp ($17) and thankful I did. It was delicious. The presentation was almost too pretty to eat. The shrimp is wrapped in potato shreds then fried. It comes with a mango/peanut slaw and the crisp slaw pairs so well with the shrimp.

Also ordered the steak tartare just because I love tartares. It was also delicious. It comes with a quail egg in the middle so it adds just the right creaminess to the already flavourful tartare. You can either eat it alone or pair it with some sourdough bread.

The owner also came around to say hi and ask how everything was doing. An small order of brussel sprouts was also on the house. Finished the whole bowl, never have I liked brussel sprouts that much. 

Highly recommend this place. Will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"3/5. Great atmosphere. The food was well made, just lacked the little bit extra. Steak Tartar was a slightly spicy, and pretty good. The prosciutto pizza stole the show. The level doesn't quite make reach 'must have', but you'll enjoy a leisurely dinner with drinks.  However, the pizza rivals that of any Toronto Neapolitan pizzerias. On pizza merit only, 4.5."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great with cool decor in a massive dining room. 

Food was OK. I went for brunch so wanted the southern fried chicken and waffles (none on a Sunday at Noon) as well as the apple upside down cake (apparently off the menu now), so I was a bit disappointed. Opted for the cheeseburger and breakfast pizza. Cheeseburger was on a nice bun and came with exceptional fries. Breakfast pizza was decent. 3 stars for outdated menus and slow service."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food and the ceviche was amazing! The cocktails are very good as well! Definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a date-night dinner a few months back.  This place left such a great impression on me, I had to make sure I wrote up my review.

I had been looking forward to checking out The Good Son ever since it opened. As a Top Chef Canada fan, I was keen to see how Executive Chef and owner Vittorio Colacitti would live up to all the hype.  He delivered in spades.

A couple of dishes really stood out. Steak tartare - meat was so finely cut and perfectly seasoned. Honestly the best steak tartare I've ever had (and I've had many). And the grilled octopus - so tender and flavourful. The server told us it is marinated for days and cooked sous-vide. Bar Isabel's octopus comes pretty close, but The Good Son's version is my favourite.  My hubby had steak frites which was really good. I had the ribs which were tasty. 

Service was very attentive and friendly. Venue is very hipster yet cozy. Food is exceptional. Highly recommend, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time in at Good Son last night with a party of 5 celebrating a birthday. We kept it simple in the beverage department ordering bottles of Syrah and draft beer so I can't comment on any of the cocktails. 

The group started with the sopressata pizza - delicious, thin crust pizza - gives Libretto a run for their money. Perfect, really.

For mains we ordred 2 steaks - deliciously crusted and cooked to perfect medium rares, the ribs - very tender and coated in a really tasty sauce, scallops - good, not much to them and 2 sides of brussel sprouts and cauliflower - brussel sprouts were amazing! 

Service was attentive and friendly without getting too familiar - we really enjoyed Tyler."}
{"text":"Cute decor, decent service. Brunch food was underwhelming and not appetizing. Eggs Benedict tasted off and pancakes were too deep fried. Likely would go back."}
{"text":"Extraordinary pizzas with imaginative, well-chosen toppings on a light Neapolitan crust .. expensive, for pizza, but when something is expensive and very good the expensiveness seems to count for less than when it is cheap and bad, in which case the cheapness does not make up for it being bad ... that said, the house wine was expensive but unexceptional, somewhat skewing the overall ratio of expensiveness to quality."}
{"text":"Extremely loud place. We were seated on a uncomfortable stool at that counter in front of the window, without being asked for our opinion, even though we had a reservation. Understaffed, hence terrible service: 45 min to get our drinks, no water on the table, over 1h to get 10 oysters, we got some of our order a good 20 min after (2 hours in total for 3 small plates). The food was good, but nothing outstanding. Overpriced, fancy small plates to share, like many places in Toronto. The setting is nice though."}
{"text":"I love the candle-and-Edison-bulb lit atmosphere of this place. Service is great and food is fantastic. Go ahead and get yourself one of their signature cocktails-- the Kentucky Guido is really refreshing in a frozen brass mug. Or just get wine by the glass, jar or bottle.

The dish options are plenty but not overwhelming. Try the fish of the day-- the whole dish changes based on seasonality and the chef's inspiration."}
{"text":"Great pizza and I love the decor. The drinks are on the pricy side and the bartenders are snooty as hell."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunday morning and the place was packed (just like every other restaurant in Toronto on a sunday morning), we walked in and stood awkwardly in front of the entrance for a full two minutes before somebody came to recognize our existence. Granted they were obviously quite busy. We got seated at the bar (we did not have a reservation) which was not ideal but fine. All of this would have been okay if their food delivered. Unfortunately their food was mediocre at best and there are very little choices. This place is ok if you are just extremely indifferent to what you eat or can find nowhere else to eat. Otherwise, there are countless other restaurants in the city that serve better food."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and reasonably priced. although choices were limited. However all else was not great, thus the low rating. Our complaints include the noise, the reservation system and to a lesser degree the table service. 

My husband made a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. A few hours before that, he received a call telling him that for since we were a party of 8, we would have to order from their prix fixe menu, plus make our choices in advance. Imagine, trying to coordinate that at the last minute. 

As it happened, one friend had to arrive late and there was a bit of uncertainty as to whether he would make it. We were able to legitimately change our reservation to 7 people.  But, we were then told that we could then, only get a 7:30 p.m. reservation.

I was not able to finish my dinner and was looking forward to the leftovers. The waiter grabbed my plate without asking if I was finished and did not ask if I wanted to take it home. Before I could say anything he had stacked a couple of other plates on top of my dinner so it was too late to rescue it. 

since we live in the neighbourhood, might consider a return visit to sit at the bar - close enough to hear each other - with my husband. I was not able to hear what he was saying across the table. Had a sore throat when I left. Would not come here for an evening out. Our group left quickly after dinner and went to have our coffee at Starbucks.

I'm reposting this as the previous version has dissappered from the list of reviews for Good Son. I've heard that it is possible for restaurants to hide bad reviews."}
{"text":"This place was gorgeous inside. The decor was spectacular! We got the jerk shrimp, really good!, the spicy pizza, amazing! And the ribs and corn with fries. I would not get the ribs again. And definitely not the best in the city. They were fatty and oddly long with no meat on them. All the presentations were spot on. All picture worthy. People beside us got the bed tartar with the oysters all looked great. We got the velvet devil wine. Really nice. I hated the waiter. I think she was on a bad mood or that she had to serve girls, not sure. It was my birthday! And she brought down the mood. Want excited and I had to pay for my dessert which was 2 scoops of gelato. I would go back there again and order food and drinks with friends. A great place for a big party as well"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for dinner last week and it was really great. The food is reasonably priced and large portions. Everyone needs to try the prosciutto pizza!!  Our server Dave was great and very attentive and the cocktails he suggested were fantastic. I will absolutely be going back!"}

I haven't been to any newly opened restaurants lately so when a friend asked me if I wanted to check out The Good Son, I was glad to tag along. 
When I walked into The Good Son, I immediately fell in love with the restaurant. It was quite spacious with lots of leather furnitures that reminded me of 'grandpa's library'.
Even the high chairs had back support, horray! You know how I feel about uncomfortable bar seats, ugh.
We arrived pretty early in the evening so getting a table was pretty easy. There were 3 of us so we were seated at one of the tables located in the middle of the restaurant.

Ordered: Jerk Shrimp 4/5

* Crispy potato, green mango, fresh peanut for $15.00
* 3 fat shrimp pieces were covered up in deep fried potato string pieces
* It was served hot and the shrimps were super juicy
* Green mango pieces on the bottom was nice touch
* I thought it was tad bit expensive with each shrimp being $5 
* But overall it was a nice appetizer to start our meal

Ordered: Wild Mushroom 4/5

* Taleggio and pesto pizza for $17.00
* Obviously I picked this pizza to fufil my mushroom obession lately
* Pizza was decent size, good for one meal or to share with everybody for a bite
* I found the pizza to be quite oily due to pesto
* Dough was thin and overall it was very flavorful

Ordered: Steak Tartare 4/5

* Soft boiled quail egg with steak tartare served with grilled bread for $19.00
* I heard good things about their steak tartare so this was a must order
* This dish was served to us after the pizza and the ribs which I thought was kind of weird
* Steak tartare was very good quality, creamy and melt in my mouth
* I thought this was one of better steak tartare I had in awhile

Ordered: Sarsaparilla Side Ribs 5/5

* Beef ribs served with sunchokes and scallions for $19.00 (half) or $35.00 (whole)
* We ordered half to share since we wanted to try other dishes
* I wasn't aware of the fact that these were beef ribs when we ordered it
* I love beef ribs!! Yummmm
* This was so good, fall of the bone and the bbq sauce was so delicious
* Slightly charred on the outside, I couldn't get enough of the ribs
* I would def get this again if I went back

Overall I really enjoyed my meal at The Good Son. All of the dishes we ordered were delicious and you could tell they put a lot of thought into each dish. My only complaint was that the service was sooooooo slow. It took forever to flag down our server near end of our meal that to get our bill and pay for them- it took more than 30 minutes! Which I sort of understand because they just opened recently but still. Anyways, I left pretty satisfied and can't wait to go back. Next time I go, I want to order a bottle of wine and spend some time enjoying all the beautiful decoration at The Good Son."}
{"text":"The overall look of the place is stunning, the atmosphere is cozy. Our waitress was impeccable; super friendly and knowledgeable. The food was good, but one of our plates was under seasoned (it tasted a little bland), and the other came without one of the key ingredients, which was only brought to us once we finished our plate. Our drinks were well-balanced and tasty. 

Overall, a nice experience, but I wasn't blown away!"}
{"text":"5 for the food, 5 for the ambience, 2 for service. 

the food here is amazing. i've been here once for a dinner for 7 and once for brunch for 2. on both occasions, food was consistently delicious. i HIGHLY recommend the steak tartare- it's the best i've had in the city. the quail egg definitely helps also. it's a must-try! 

service here as also, disappointingly, consistently sucked. on our dinner reservation, the server was very slow and it seemed like she had too large of a service area to keep all the patrons happy. she didn't take all of our coats (it was a small booth- we needed the arm space) even when we asked her to, and was slow on the water refills. the food came out at a descent pace. 

for brunch, my friend and i noticed that we got the SAME server (her name was Mel) who again, was slow on service. our food also took a much longer time to arrive- so perhaps they had less kitchen staff for brunch. we also wanted to try this dining payment app called Tab, which would have given us $10 off each of our meals as a part of a promo that Tab was offering. when we asked our server about Tab, she had no idea what it was and went to ask the manager. and then when she came back, she said that we couldn't USE the app because the restaurant's iPad wasn't plugged in overnight and had no battery. 

it APPEARED as though she just didn't want to let us use the app, or that she was not very well-trained on the details of the app. either way, she could have used her basic problem-solving skills. we could have WENT to a nearby outlet with her so that she can TURN the damn iPad on. it was very frustrating. if i ever come back here, i will request to not be seated in her service area."}
{"text":"Very surprised,

Make sure you double check your reservations.  This place has no problem turning you away and not taking your business.

Don't be fooled be other reviews, be weary and make sure that you confirm your booking 3x over.

Made a booking a week prior, then got the confirmation call a day prior to the booking.

Showed up as promised and advised by hostess, after a line progressed, that there was nothing that could be done!...not even a manager came out to talk to us about THIER MISTAKE!

Walked out looking for another place, found a great Cuban Restaurant near by (thank god)...review to come on that place (loved it)

Will not reco this place to everyone we know!!!

Thanks to The Good son staff for helping us find La Cubana!!!"}
{"text":"Food and cocktails were good, but the decor is overdone and the service was not friendly. Order timing - we were warned food would come out as it's ready, but this isn't great for small groups and makes for some awkwardness. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I would probably go again, but I'm
not in a rush to return. The food was good but over priced for the portion size. And the service was friendly, but being charged for champaign that they brought to the table because it was our anniversary, turned a nice gesture into something that left a bad impression on the overall experience.

That said still an nice location with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Incredible spot...even if you aren't hungry this would be a great place just to stop for a drink to appreciate the ambiance.  We went for brunch on Sunday morning...it wasn't too busy so we didn't have to wait.  My husband and friends both ordered eggs benedicts and I had the pancakes.  It's been a few days and he can't stop raving about his food. My pancakes were good but I was not full after.  I wanted their apple cake but they said it wasn't offered eventhough it was still on their brunch menu.  Great spot nontheless, I'd like to come for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Loved my beer and food here the other night. 
Brussel sprouts are way more spectacular than anything I could have imagined. Sweet, spicy, salty! 
The brew was a winter ale that was complex and tasty. Perfect warm up for an evening at Canadian Music Week."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for diner without a reservation. No biggie, we took a seat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails which were really good. We shared a cheese burger and prosciutto pizza which were both amazing! 

The burger's cheese and bun are made from scratch in house, and the burger chuck is ground with veal bone marrow which made it really juicy and full of flavour. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium doneness and The fries that Accompanied it were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and tasted really good.

This place has a wood burning pizza oven and The prosciutto pizza that came out of it was amazing! The thin crust was crisp, and nicely charred, and the combination and amount of prosciutto, arugula, basil, tomato, mascarpone was well balanced. A few drops of the chilli oil took it another level.

The service was really good, and I really liked the ambiance. It's unpretentious, and warm."}
{"text":"I went on a date here and I chose the restaurant so I was keeping my fingers crossed it would work out. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, the decor is great here. It's warm and interesting and there's plenty to look at. In fact, I got distracted a few times by something cool I noticed on the wall. Anyhow, the food was also great. The brussel sprouts really are amazing and you need to order them. They are coated in delicious sauce and then panfried (I think?). We also ordered the steak tartar which was really yum. For mains I had scallops and he had the fish. Fish/seafood can really go either way in Toronto and fortunately both of our meals were well-prepared and delicious. Drinks were good too. Service was excellent and everyone was helpful and friendly. Overall, it was a great meal and I'll definitely be back! We ordered 2 apps, 2 mains, 1 dessert and a few drinks each -- our bill came to $150."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks with family. Service was impeccable! 
I drank the non alcoholic raspberry drink. If you like tart drinks it is great. We had the ceviche which was awesome! Also tried the cheese platter that was good. The french fries were yummy. The scallop dish was amazing and the chicken dish was good too. Cool vibe! Great artsy neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and okay food. 

Steak tartare, jerk shrimp, spicy Brussels sprouts. 

The Brussels were the highlight - saucy and delicious. The shrimp itself was nothing special, but the mango salad it's served on brought in some nice flavour. The steak tartare didn't do much for me, seemed to be lacking in the flavour department. 

A nice enough meal, but won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews since for the most part I don't have much to complain or rave about.  However I felt compelled to write a review about my experience at  the Good Son on June 25, 2016.   Overall Food was good, the wait service was good.  I write this review to point out the service of the hostesses.  I am not sure why there needed to be two hostesses since they didn't seem very busy and one of them kept walking in and out of the restaurant every minute while we were there without assisting anyone.  It seemed like she was just a busy body without being very useful to anyone, This really is a distraction for those who are seated by the entrance.  This ruined our dining experience as we were seated right by the entrance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"MAKE NOTE: Decor 5/5, 6/5 even if I could. Food 3.5/5 

DECOR, DECOR, DECOR. Love, absolutely love. Walls covered in old cuckoo-clocks, a plate wall, a book shelf wall, a picture (frame) wall, all visually appealing. There's always something to look at and you can experience a different section every time you go. Highly recommended as a place to dress-up for, for a chic dining experience. 

The food on the other hand needs some improvements and may I add the service as well. The first time I went the wait-staff were overly attentive and were asking us how we were enjoying our food before we even given a chance to taste it. But, the next few times, I couldn't tell you who our waiter was, or who to talk too because everyone was flying around not really attending to anyone at all. The cheese board, versatile, but very small, especially if you were hoping to share. The moules frites were a good portion, but the mussels were small and lacked flavour and the frites could have been cut smaller (they are frites and not fries after all). The tarter sauce accompanying them was divine. Our waiter (one of them) recommended the brussels spouts, which had a unique sauce and would definitely consider ordering again. One thing I can say is I'm very impressed with their oysters, and accompanying mignonettes. Might I add they have been advertising $2 oysters every Tuesday! 

They do make fantastic cocktails. I am very picky with my martini's and I can honestly say they make some of the best in the city and delivered exactly what I was hoping for. They do try to design a seasonal menu (food and cocktails), which I understand and can respect. But don't take off some of the best items!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this restaurant so it was on my must-try list.  

On Thursday, I booked a last minute reservation on OpenTable for 4 people, at 6:15pm, for Friday night.  I'd rather eat early than wait until a 9:30pm time slot.  

Beautiful space.  A nice buzz in the restaurant but not overly noisy.  The chef was definitely doing his thing, making sure everything was running smoothly.  

Since this was our first time here, we wanted a sampling of as much as possible so this is how the ordering went:

Pizza with housemade sausage and rapini.  We really enjoyed it.  I wished the chilis and the oil had some heat, but the pizza itself was a great starter.

Dupuy lentils with pork belly.  Very tasty.  

Steak tartare.  Really good.  The portion looked a lot smaller than the photos posted but what can you do?  That's how things go, portions seem to shrink at many restaurants over time. 

The special of the day was lamb pappardelle.  If you're not into lamb, this might be a tad on the game-y side.  I would've liked the pasta to have a bit more resilience in the texture.  Overall, still good.  

Sarsaparilla ribs, half rack.  Can people seriously eat a whole rack?  These were really flavourful ribs!  I liked the grilled scallions with the meat.  The pur√©e was smooth as silk.  

Brussels sprouts.  These things were caramelized so they had a bit of crispy sweetness.  Delicious.  

Roasted squash.  It was a good accompaniment to our protein-rich dishes.  I liked the cranberries.  

I would recommend asking for a low table.  The booths looked comfy too.  We sat on the high stools at the higher tables and they weren't very comfortable. 

The service was really good.  Our server made some great recommendations.  We never felt rushed either. 

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and great ambience. Food is damn good, son. Knowledgeable staff. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience from the ambiance to the food we love loved this place. 
Eclectic style /decor delicious food. We had Jerk shrimp and Branzino fish and my friend had lamb. All of us enjoyed our time"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my parents last night and it was a very nice experience. The service was great, we were seated right away at a central table. They also have comfortable booths that are intimate for group gatherings. The food is slightly pricey but the quality is well worth it. I recommend the sweet potato soup. The amount of food you get and the portion size is worth the cost without a doubt. It is conveniently located right along queen west near  dovercourt an easily ttc accessible spot."}
{"text":"Serious flavour, seamless plating, delightful ambiance. Ah-mazing cocktails. I ordered the scallops and although you only get 2(or maybe 3), you are completely satisfied due to the complimentary flavours and textures on the plate. Staff was casual yet friendly, well versed in the menu and conversation. Would definitely come again to try the rest of the menu and cocktails :)"}
{"text":"Came back on Saturday night - so many months later, did not see our horrid server from the last review and had a great experience. This time, the service delivered - with trendy man bun and all.

Food was good, no surprises there. They have since revamped their menu and removed the brussel sprouts, which I am so sad about. The tempura mushroom is okay, not really my thing because of the maple marinade that pushes it too much into the sweet zone. The kimchi fried rice is a really solid interpretation and a generous portion size.

All in all, I'm glad I came back. They should be up and running with Tab Payments now, as I've noticed a promo code for this Wednesday, I think."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for \"the perfect brunch\" craving! 
Went there on a Sunday and had a great time.. not only is the food tasty and fresh but the interiors are Amazing as well.. very warm and cozy! 
The staff are friendly and attentive.. 
We had the chicken and waffles and we chose right, the people in our group had eggs Benedict and vouched for it as well.
Give it a try, I guarantee your will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I came for date night and we made reservations in advance. 

Overall I would say the experience was good, service was good, but food was just ok. We went in expecting some pretty damn good food, and as you'll see, not consistent enough to get the 4 or above stars. 

Steak tartar: as many mention, this will blow you away. Definitely one of the bests in the city. They start with a incredibly well seasoned, mixed, and perfectly textured steak tartar mix. On top, there's a raw quail egg, which when mixed with the tartar, gives even better texture and more depth and flavour. The finishing touch that makes this dish awesome is the toast. The toast is done in their wood oven and gives it this smoky flavour that pairs perfectly with the tartar. 

Jerk shrimp: would skip this. We ordered based on recos and reviews, but it certainly did not live up to our expectations. They come as 3 shrimp on top of a mango salad, we added a 4th for $5 more. Overall the shrimp were not very flavourful. They were wrapped in a potato string covering but they really lacked any sort of seasoning, and should definitely not be called 'jerk'. Either rename or re-season. 

Bulgogi short ribs with kimchi fried rice: as some mention below, the rice is bomb. Delicious and totally the star of the dish. However, the ribs left much to be desired. They were sliced ribs (not your rack-style) and were way overcooked to the point of dryness. The marinade was nice and balanced between sweet, salty and sticky, but the dryness of the ribs killed the dish.

Octopus and fingerling potatoes: we've had lots of octopus in many different places and countries. This was good but could be better. Portion size was amazing, you get a whole tentacle for a good price, but the thicker parts of the tentacle became somewhat tough. The tip of the tentacle was the best, seasoning was good, but again, the thicker parts of the tentacle were less seasoned relative to the amount of meat. Very filling dish though and you definitely get your moneys worth of octopus! 

We didn't end up getting dessert as we were completely stuffed. Overall dishes were very satisfying, but there was definitely something missing from most of the food that could otherwise make this restaurant a home run."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of 16 for a birthday celebration. We were told we only have an option to do a set menu that was served \"family style\". 7 of us arrived about 50 minutes late (the birthday girl has an indoor cat that got away outside, we had to find it). They skipped our first courses, we had to ask for it to be brought out. They brought us 1 pizza, which was pretty good, but it was to be shared between the 7 of us. The portion sizes were tiny. 2 regular plates of pasta to be shared between 7 people. The server told us he couldn't bring more as he \"already brought all he has for us out.\" So my question is, if you see half the table is missing, why did you bring out \"all you had\" to serve? He also had a terrible attitude. In the end he comped the birthday girls meal, which was the least he could do since she literally ate nothing. He got upset with us because we ordered a bottle of wine and rather then asking who should be charged for it and splitting it he slapped it on my friends bill. So after paying $85 a person we all headed over to McDonald's since we were starving. Wouldn't recommend this place! Terrible service with a terrible attitude!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food!!! Very cool decor. Certainly stands out from cookie cutter restos in TO. Highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"Great group atmosphere. Service was good and food full of flavour. Love the open kitchen concept and the way the dining area is separated into smaller cozy spaces."}
{"text":"If someone were to tell me to choose my last meal. I'd choose the sopresseta pizza. Went here on opening night and the vibe, decor, food, and staff was absolutely amazing. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite spots in the city.  Excellent food. The blends of the flavours make the most simple dish exquisite. 

Awesome service. Great location. Hipster atmosphere. 

Would love to come here more, but I guess once a month is a good start."}
{"text":"This place was great! Things I had:

-boulevardier cocktail
-wine
-oysters
-charcuterie
-olives
-steak frites
-octopus

split all of that with a friend - left stuffed. oysters were huge and delicious, charcuterie was good. the octopus and steak were both perfect, although I found the frites were super crispy and not awesome (maybe we got the end of an order or something).

I didn't find the service slow at all - they paced it out really nicely. it did take a few minutes to pay our bill, but what do you expect on a busy Friday night?

really nice inside, didn't find it super loud, plus they were playing awesome music that really made a difference (Nick Cave!!!).

next time definitely trying the burger and/or ribs."}
{"text":"Pains me to give it 2 stars since I fell IN LOVE with this place last year. Sad to see good quality decline. My favorite dish was the Korean Short Ribs and kimchee fried rice, the last 2 times I was here the way was fatty and chewy - unpleasant. I would have just ate the kimchee fried rice and be happy. It's outrageous great. 

This was was based upon today visit. It was very busy and we waited about 15-20 min before our waiter came by and offer us water. Service felt rush, short and no matter how busy you are...don't dish attitude (dark pony tail, beard and glasses). 

Probably will not return anytime soon"}
{"text":"1) Make a reservation
2) The pizzas are huge - for a girl
3) The pizzas are deeeeeeelicious (I had the margherita)
4) I wish the menu was a little more extensive however, I'm convinced everyone could find at least one item to love."}
{"text":"5 stars due to our waiter Chris who was very attentive, entertaining and knowledgable. Brussels sprouts rocked our world. A fun night was had. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about this place. Service, fantastic. Let's go in order. Table was ready right as we walked in. Our server hit it perfectly with his wine and cocktail selections. The food.....it was incredible. Apps, shrimp something w/ mango, coconut maybe some red curry. I can't remember but it was phenomenal. The sweet potato and lobster soup couldn't have been better at a Michelin Star whatever! What also killed it were my ribs. Half rack of sticky, sweet and salty goodness. But that's not it, the best thing I ate was the side dish of brussel sprouts. WOW! Even if you're a hater of sprouts like my wife, you'd fall off your chair eating these little candied tamari marvels. 

I highly recommend this place. It is a massive step up from the white room that was Nyood. The decor is warm and trendy and I didn't feel out of place with my lumberjack beard ;-)"}
{"text":"Impeccable service.  Interesting and curated interior atmosphere. Like the mad hatter found anti psychotics and opened a industrial rustic bistro. So I swooned.  
The drinks... the menu is really interesting and after choosing two superb cocktails that just didn't hit the mark, the bartender gladly whipped me up a non menu bevvy, corpse reviver #2. And it was lively, balanced and refined. I asked for his number. We went out. I got pregnant. Jking. But I would date the drink for sure. 

Food: perfect balanced choices of veg, carb and meats. We had the chicken parfait, alone, would have been very good. But with the jerk shrimp, which are knee melting, it failed to do much for us. The cheeseburger was cooked just right. Toppings are carefully thought out, just like every other aspect of the restaurant. 
Had the olive oil cake with rhubarb, I hate cake and rhubarb,  date loves those things. I ate it, could tell it was well made and delicious, but yuck, I hate cake so it's saying a lot that it was edible to me. 

Overall, a fastidiously put together experience. Not a single disappointment. And the ambience and service make this place a must return. Don't go here, I never want to have to wait for those jerk shrimp and perfect libations."}
{"text":"A night out on a warm summer evening. The place is walking distance and reading the menu online didn't really give me much of an indication. But let me say this, decor amazing, location great, drinks creative and generous and the food was straight forward in it's composition but of high quality and taste in delivery. Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"The place definitively has character!  And even on a Sunday night was rather on the loud side - but I guess that is just part of the vibe. 

They had a nice (but small) beer selection I tap - but more interestingly had a couple of house cocktails which where pre-mixed and stored in small barrels to let it rest - kind of a nice touch. 

For the meal I went with what seems to be one of the more popular item (that's not a pizza that is) the short ribs with kim che rice. 

Although everything was expertly seasoned and the quail egg on top was perfectly cooked, I must've met that I was slightly disappointed with the cut quality of the short ribs - it was quite a lot and ends and silver skin to deal with. 

For dessert I had their take on the ice cream sandwich - which was quite tasty although maybe someone over sweet. 

In the end, I definitely enjoyed myself and still give them a solid four star mainly for the atmosphere and service which helped overlook some of the food prep issues."}
{"text":"Came here two nights ago as we stumbled across the restaurant looking for a place to have dinner while strolling down Queen St. The standout element of the restaurant would definitely be the decor - very vintage and classy at the same time. We ordered some oysters and spicy brussel sprouts to start, while I had the halibut for main and my boyfriend, the ravioli. I found the menu misleading, as the brussel sprouts turned out to be not spicy at all. Instead, they were fried and placed in a sauce that was more sweet and sour than spicy. Also, did not enjoy that the brussel sprouts at the bottom of the bowl soaked up all the sauce so the spicy and sour were quite overpowering. It was also kind of weird that our mains came while we were still midway through our appetizers. However, despite those minor mishaps, their overall food and drink quality was quite good. I really enjoyed my halibut and the date night atmosphere was very relaxing. I look forward to coming back again for another date night or a round of drinks with friends."}
{"text":"This is the best place. I don't know why I've never lined up to get in. The bartenders are the best in the city, the food never disappoints and the decor is inviting. Always ask for a wine recommendation with your meal!"}
{"text":"We heard many good reviews about this restaurant so we decided to check it out. I was a huge fan of the decor immediately. The lighting is a bit dim but it definitely sets the mood for a quiet date night.

The service was excellent, as our waiter immediately greeted us and took our drink orders. There was two of us and since we weren't that hungry we decided to share a Wood-Oven pizza (proscuitto). Do not underestimate the size of the pizza for the price. It is a very large pizza. The crust was aromatic and just the right amount of dough. The toppings complimented each other well, I mean how can you go wrong with prosciutto and arugula, classic. We didn't end up finishing it, only because we were stuffed! 

I have walked by here many times and have seen the whole restaurant booked up for events and after dining here, I can see why many people would want to host big events such as birthdays and engagement parties here. 

Great place!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday around 1 p.m. with a group of five friends. Had the burger and Caesar - both absolutely delicious. Didn't wait in line - we made a reservation but it wasn't necessary. Great, attentive service. Good spot, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but service took a long time for brunch and the place wasn't that full.  Friend wanted a cheeseburger, was told they were out (really?) and then we see people around us eating cheeseburgers.. just weird. 

The Apple/Bacon pizza is great, and the Breakfast Pizza is a work of art. The chicken & waffles is OK - the chicken is better than the waffles, but you don't get a big portion of either.  Inside decor is awesome.  Would go again"}
{"text":"I've tried almost every dish on the menu. Hamachi crudo, eggplant dip, jerk shrimp all stunners!!!  I had the du puy lentils with glazed pork belly which was phenomenal ! 
The cocktails are all executed very well and I found myself ordering more cocktails than my usual drinks."}
{"text":"Overall a 3.5

Food - 7.5/10
Service - 5/10

Food was pretty good. Jerk shrimp a bit average. Steak Frites very good - very nice and tender albeit slightly pricey at close to $40 per.  Creme Catalan dessert also good but wasn't very exciting by any means. 

Fell down on service however. Food was slow - found out later the appetizer was sent to the wrong table hence the wait. They were out of the bottle of wine we chose, recommended something 25% more expensive. Service was friendlyish but we were waiting at very portion of the meal - get menus, drinks to arrive, and all courses to arrive. For a $250 meal I would have expected much more."}
{"text":"Color me impressed when you can make reservations for brunch. Although an asterisk should be denoted as they only serve brunch on Sundays (which I discovered when arriving on a Saturday without a reservation the first time I attempted to come here).
That said, I was quite pleased with the experience when I made it in the doors.

Damn fine chicken and waffles on their menu grabbed my attention. 3 pieces of chicken (1 thigh, 2 drumsticks if memory serves correct) on 2 pieces of waffle (aka half of a large waffle) with some syrup and a berry compote of sorts in the mix. I could've licked the plate clean it.
Everything got good reviews, and from creeping on other tables meals I'll say the breakfast pizza and the Filipino breakfast options both looked quite good while unique. (EDIT AFTER RETURNING: Fillipino breakfast is solid if drenched in hot sauce, but the white rice is kind of boring otherwise)

Drink selection was a bit less impressive, including $12 caesars and an unimpressive but adequate tap beer selections. 

On an atmosphere topic, I'll say that I like how the place has a darkness to the room, as since the ceilings are so tall here is actually keeps the place feeling cozy. All in all, a nice new addition to my Queen Street West brunch list!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great for groups but it can be really loud, so just be okay with that. 

New Zealand Spinach salad to start which was great, and the pomegranates were so fresh. The grilled octopus was delicious, but a few initial bites weren't as warm as id like. They were very busy, but I think it sat for a minutes too long. But the flavors were excellent.  

Very nice staff. No wifi."}
{"text":"ANTHONY ROSE YOU HAVE OUT DONE YOURSELF!!!!!!  This place is everything a Queen WEst restaurant should be- from the eclectic interior, the palatable mouth candy and thirst quenching fountain of craft cocktails comparable to the elixir of life.  I would rate 20/10 stars if I could.  Anyone (and I mean ANYONE) who tries to compete with The GOod Son will be a sad son, for they will lose badly.  There is NO competition whatsoever so nice try NOT to those who dare try to battle you on the field of restaurateurs."}
{"text":"I dropped into The Good Son two Fridays ago with some girlfriends, interested in checking out the old Nyood space and beckoned by the attractive pseudo patio bar seating at the front promising potential people watching opportunities (say that 5 times fast!).

Inside, the walls are a mishmash of clocks, old mirrors, framed paintings and books and the place has an overall vibe of polished coziness. I think I spotted a gold clock that my parents still have sitting on their mantle at home from the 70s, nice.

We tried one dish from each section of the menu (which is divvied up into hot, cold, pizza and wood):

-Ash roasted eggplant - great smoke flavour to the eggplant and a very creamy texture, the naan i wouldn't say tasted the most authentic but that didn't really detract from the dish necessarily either

-Steak tartare - nice bigger chunks of meat here, for a tartare, which I enjoyed texturally along with the stronger caper flavour

-Spicy soppresata pizza - you know how sometimes pizza described as 'spicy' ends up being 'mildly tongue tingling but otherwise uneatable', so this was ACTUALLY spicy (in the best way possible) + quite tasty

-Depuy lentils with pork belly - yum yum yum, couldn't also get enough of the sauce that accompanied the lentils

All in all, everything we had was delicious which was quite a pleasant surprise (for a first go at any restaurant that is). Our waiter was also quite delectable and charming.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid 4. Loved it. We walked in on a sat with no reservation so we're surprised to be accommodated. Front of house staff were super friendly and squeezed in at the window. Even came back later to offer is a table but were liked the people watching. 

Awesome cocktails, including virgin options for this preggo lady. 

We had the shrimp and I had a burger.  Both were great and interesting. My husband's pizza was the only miss. Sauce was way way too salty. Our friend had the short ribs and they were delicious. 

Crowd was hip and well dressed. Lots of groups and dates and energy in the room. A nice buzz to the place. 

They have the Soho house, westlodge, old lpc look going with the dark leather, gentlemen's club decor, but the windows and tall tables switch it up nicely.   

We will go back again soon."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant a couple weeks ago as I had read a couple good Yelp reviews, and have a love of trying new restaurants in the city. 

I wish I was able to try more of the dishes but here's what I did try: 
jerk shrimp - I was really excited to try these as they were hyped up online. I didn't find them that exceptional - small shrimp, and the sauce was below par. 
scallops - these were fantastic. serviced with citrus. 
Pizza - LOVED The pizza. 
My dinner mate ate the burger, and loved it. 

I loved the vibe of the place, and the service was good. It was nice to see it so busy only a couple weeks after opening and on a Thursday night. 

I will consider going back with friends so I can try some more of the dishes :)"}
{"text":"Took a chance on coming here without a reservation on a Friday night. They squeezed us in before the next reservation and we comfortably sat and didn't feel rushed at all. 

Service was great. It started to falter a bit near the end when we needed the bill. But all through the beginning and during our meal, our server felt earnest and excited to help us enjoy our time there. 

Food was tasty. The pig face and chimichurri pizza was flavour and garlicky. The lamb farfalle had a bit too much orange peel in it for my liking but the pasta and lamb were cooked really nicely."}
{"text":"Came here this past Friday evening and had a great time! It was my first time here and I will definitely be back. The hostess was very friendly. I walked in without a reservation and she told me I could have a table until 8:45pm, at which point there was a reservation. That gave my date and I about an hour and a half to eat dinner which was plenty. She hung up my coat for me and took me inside. The server was really nice too, a younger guy with fabulous curls. I arrived before my date and sat by myself for a little while but he was still super attentive, asked if I wanted to wait, I said yes, and then after ~5-10 minutes came back again and asked if I wanted a drink while I waited, great service! The food was also great, they had a double smoked bacon pizza and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Six months ago I would have gave this place 4 stars but I have recently discovered I have a gluten allergy. Most restaurants have not been much of an issue but the Goodson falls short. Nothing \"good\" on the menu is gluten free and the server/kitchen didn't offer any suggestions/solutions."}
{"text":"I was beyond impressed with this restaurant. I came here for my birthday and was blown away with it all. First of all the decor is just beautiful, it felt like I was in New York with the seating and decor. It definitely set the mood and tone for the night. We were greeted by our lovely waiter and ordered mulled wine. The mulled wine came in a le creuset coffee cup with the saucer, I absolutely loved how they served it. The mulled wine was delicious, it was the perfect drink for a cold day. We ordered 4 dishes for the 3 of us to share, although we thought we could handle 6 but our waiter politely told us 4 is enough. I am really glad they are honest with us instead of allowing us to order too much food and not finish it. We ordered the charcuterie board with cheese and it was to die for. It was the perfect size for an appetizer. After that we had the mussels with frites and oh my god were the French fries the best I have ever had! It was crispy but fluffy at the same time. It was definitely one of our favourite items on the menu, highly recommend trying it. After that we had the scallops. I was beyond impressed with the scallops, it was seated perfectly. Our final dish was the prosciutto pizza with mascarpone cheese. That pizza was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Of course we had to order dessert, we shared the ice cream sandwich and creme caramel. The ice cream sandwich was chewy and the ice cream was very creamy. The creme caramel was very delicious as well, personally I liked the ice cream sandwich a bit better. Overall my experience here blew my mind and I would definitely be coming back here again. 5/5 for food, decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved dining here with my husband. The decor was incredibly inviting. The food was great and our waitress was even better! Will definitely be coming back when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Everything is okay at best. The food was extremely  under seasoned (we had a featured pasta and the chicken) and the portion sizes were also quite small. 

If this were a a 1 or 2 dollar sign, it would be a 3 star but at the price point, we really expected a much better food experience."}
{"text":"First off I would like to note that I made a reservation for 8:15PM but we didn't get there until 8:45. They sent me a text at around 8:30 to reconfirm with me if I was still going to be there. I thought it was one of those automated do-not-reply-to-this text but my friend suggested that I should just reply to it with a \"yes\" just for the heck of it and so I did. 

When we got there we were very embarrassed for being late but they said they still had the table saved for the two of us so I was like \"SCORE!\". They actually read the text and kept the table reserved for us even though we were almost about half an hour late. 

Now onto the actual review...

The decor is amazing. Had a really rustic feel and a steam punk feel with old wooden walls and a lot of old victorian black and white photos. Each wall was filled with a bunch of vintage victorian-esque items. One wall had a bunch of clocks and another wall with a bunch of random items. Well decorated restaurant for sure, by far one of my favourites. 

The atmosphere is very laid back with a formal feel to it, great for dates or eating out with a group of friends. 

We heard that one of the Top Chef Canada contestant is the owner of this restaurant so right away we knew the food would be amazing. Everything on the menu sounded fantastic but my friend and I chose the SALSICCIA PIZZA and the BULGOGI SHORT RIBS.

The BULGOGI SHORT RIBS were perfect. The marinade on those bad boys was spot on. It came with kimchi fried rice, fried quail egg, grilled green onions and some kind of sweet and spicy garlic aioli that was brushed onto the plate. The presentation was great. Well plated, it looked great and it also tasted great. The kimchi fried rice was just kimchi fried rice but when it was paired up with a piece of bulgogi and everything else, the flavours were bold and rich. Definitely get this!

The SALSICCIA PIZZA had three toppings, their housemade sausage, rapini and scamorza. Another great dish. Very strong and rich flavours as well but the rapini helped by infusing that nice bitter taste to cut the richness. What can I say, a well done pizza indeed.

Overall, this restaurant has become one of my favourite go to spots for dinner. Beautiful decor, great food and the service was great. I felt bad for making the waitress refill my cup with water so many times, haha but she was a trooper for noticing my empty cups!"}
{"text":"They hooked us with the Wednesday deal, when you can get any of their pizzas for $10 including the purchase of a drink.  The pizza was VERY good.  We had the Mauna Loa, which was a fun twist on a Hawaiian.  Drinks were delicious too.

Call me cheap, but the rest of the menu was quite pricey in my opinion, so I think I'll stick to the pizzas.  However, the pizza was so good, I would pay full price for it ... better than the equally-expensive Terroni.

Service and interior decor were great, a welcome bonus!"}
{"text":"Nice food, great service (Some of them very funny), great decor, and good pricing. 

Would return in the future. Saw some people snacking on the main courses, and the burger looked great."}
{"text":"I went to The Good Son on a Thursday night with two girlfriends and no reservations. We felt like it was our lucky day when we got seats facing the street with the windows open to enjoy the nice summer weather. That changed quickly when all I kept getting was wafts of cigarette smoke. Definitely not the most appetizing smell to say the least. It also took a while for our server to take our orders. The girls and I were praying for the experience to get better. And luckily it did. Thank God for the drinks and food. I had the Pimms cup and the short ribs on kimchi fried rice. It's the best meal I have had in a long while. The guac and chips were also delicious. I just wish they brought this out before our meals came out instead of with our meals. The high rating is obviously because I was blown away by my meal. Such a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"We go out a lot so I figured I should start reviewing places in our home town and not just when we're travelling.

My first impression was a little off putting.  We walked in around 6 PM on a Thursday and saw and empty restaurant.  When we asked for a table we were asked if we had reservations.  We politly said no and were then told by the hostess that she \"would see what she could do as long as we were out by 8:30\".  A little ridiculous if you ask me.  You don't turn away people at your door.  You make the room which in this case was very easy to do.
We were seated at a table near the front window which had a bench seat on one side and a club chair on the other.  Not the most ideal when you're having dinner but I can seen for drinks and apps that it can work.

Our waitress came by and was very polite and up beat.  She explained the menu was more situate to small plates and sharing which we love to do. We decided to go with the jerk shrimp which were very tasting but very small portion with only 3 shrimp.  The not so spicy sopressata pizza - extremely good, crispy thin crust. And the burger which was average at best.  It lacked any flavor what so ever and was very messy to eat.  The fries that came with it were good despite being over salted.  It's time restaurants stop with the \"gourmet\" burgers.  At $16 it was hardly worth it.  It's a burger FFS.  Mc D's is doing pretty well with their Big Mac and it's only $5.  Don't be snarky, you enjoy Mc D's on occasion too.  

All and all it's a pretty nice place.  It would probably be more at home on King St. rather than Queen but I guess Queen West is changing too."}
{"text":"Went to The Good Son for brunch, which they only have on Sundays. We got the Eggs Florentine and French Toast. The Eggs Florentine was alright, not bad by any means, but just wasn't spectacular. The French Toast however.... Let me just say it was probably the best French Toast I've ever had! The flavours worked so well together and the toast (brioche) itself was perfectly fluffy. It came with a creme anglaise sauce, with a berry compote and roasted apples. It was just fantastic. I would highly recommend if you're coming here for brunch. Otherwise the service was excellent and the vibes of the place felt really relaxed and homey. I'd love to come back again to try their dinner menu, which I hear is pretty great too."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! For us, a good dinning experience is about a nice balance of food, service and venue and this place combines all 3 to perfection. The venue is beautiful! Great style, clean, nice lighting and cozy. Service was a tad slow, but to be fair it was almost a full house. Other than that everyone was kind and helpful. And best of all, the food!!!! We loved it. Portions were perfect in size, and it was absolutely delicious. Very fresh and tasty. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food! We went for brunch and the food was amazing but the service was very dry and cold.
The drinks are comparable to the ones at Weslodge. You'll get a variety of summer cocktails infused with whiskey.
The steak tartare is to die for! I would greatly recommend it for a light lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner last Friday night and perhaps my expectations were very high but I found the food, simply okay. I ordered their steak tartare, after reading other reviews, I was hoping that it would be out of this world. I found the quantity very small for $21 and there was to many flavours going on. I was hoping for more meat. I then ordered their cod as it was their fish of the day and it was seared nicely. Their fennel salad was dressed lightly and their potatoes crispy. Overall, the service was top notch, very cool environment and fun decor. However, for almost spending $150 on a meal, I was left feeling hungry."}
{"text":"The Good Son is a great place for a casual dinner. Here are a few things to note as you plan:

1. Pizzas. They specialize in pizzas with a drier (not greasy) crust. The Moana Loa is delicious.
2. In addition to pizza, they do comfort food such as a jerk shrimp appetizer, steak frites, steak tartare, burgers, salads, etc. This is the place to come with a group when you are not sure how to please everyone. 
3. The place has a fun/strange vibe (lots of 100 year old photos all over the walls) that attracts a youthful crowd from Liberty Village and other nearby neighbourhoods.
4. The restaurant is loud. If you want an intimate conversation, best try elsewhere. It gets loud in here at dinner.
5. Service is very good. The staff are attentive and quick with refills, cheques, etc."}
{"text":"If decor was edible, I would like to eat at this place often. I was fascinated by the the multiple themed walls, and definitely stared at the old school clocks and faded miniatures for most of the dinner. Service is friendly, came by often to check on us, and made sure we had everything we wanted. 

I ordered the lobster tagliatelle from the specials menu. Fresh pasta mixed with cashews for extra texture and chunks of lobster and shrimp for flavor. I would definitely order this again, since it was a perfect balance of all my favourite things. Hopefully they don't take it off the menu anytime soon."}
{"text":"More like The Okay Son. The service was good - a bit hurried - but our server was friendly and very attentive. We ordered the jerk shrimp, steak tartare and the octopus. The jerk shrimp while good, was quite small, only three shrimp. I guess that's why it's on the appetizer page! The actual steak tartare was delicious, I would have preferred larger slices of toast but all in all, it was good. I would not suggest the octopus - I'm fairly sure it was undercooked. All in all, it was an okay experience. Most likely will not be going back. With a few tweaks, this place could be much better."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and headed to The Good Son for lunch. In terms of service I had low expectations based on the reviews I had read. Although the restaurant was 15 minutes late opening (give me a break! you know what timeyou open, so I would think you would prepare accordingly) Our server was actually great. He was right on time with drink refills and very friendly. The freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice was delicious. The OJ tasted funny (though this could be a weird pregnancy moment). I ordered the pork and apple pizza and my husband ordered the fried chicken. The pork and apple pizza was okay. It was nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about. The fried chicken, however, showed up with a short curly dark hair (shivers). The server was kind enough to take it away and off our bill. Unless I want to play detective and figure out where that hair came from -- maybe a beard, or maybe a more intimate place -- I cannot imagine eating there again."}
{"text":"Meh, it was just ok. Nice looking bar and staff (like out of a Frank&Oak ad... startling.) Easy to get a spot for two at the bar for a late Sunday brunch. Food took a super long time to come out (they apologized) and when it did arrive the chicken in the chicken and waffles was still bloody and pink and raw. The waiter was very professional and apologetic and offered me a complimentary cocktail while they fixed it so it was handled well, but in general the food was just ok, fine you know? The coffees were really not great and really over priced. 

The enormous manly man casually chopping hot peppers for our entire meal, and the other manly man who threw two pieces of bread backwards over his shoulder to land perfectly on the grill on the wood burning stove were the definite highlights."}
{"text":"Not only a good meal but an overall amazing experience.  The bar staff expecially was keen to make us love our visit.

If you are not sure what you want the recomendations are a great place to start.

Will definately come again."}
{"text":"I want to love this restaurant, but I can't. I feel that this is a perfect example of a restaurant that doesn't care about its patrons. Firstly, buyer beware, refills of your 8oz iced up fountain pop are $3.25, not something they will tell you. Also, this is the priciest wine menu I have seen outside of your typical Jacobs style steakhouse. When you get past the prices, the service has some to be desired. Two cooks, and 4 servers for the whole restaurant made for slow and impersonal service. I was terribly disappointed. 
The food itself was ok. The Neapolitan Pizzas are very good and would be the go to on this menu. My suggestion to anyone thinking of this restaurant - do yourself a favor, grab a bottle of wine at the lcbo and order take-out from them."}
{"text":"Very nice and spacious place, great place for a group dinner and for social events! Pizza was great, especially with the Wed $10 deal with purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing! Beautiful location, great and friendly service. The food was amazing. I had the cheeseburger and my friends had two sharing plates which looked marvelous. They claimed it was some of the best food they had. We had the toasted marshmallow dessert which is god sent. Highly recommend. Really enjoyed out evening there."}
{"text":"The Good Son is definitely worth a try. I've been meaning to visit this place for a while and finally got to do so recently. We ordered the following:

JERK SHRIMP [Crispy Potato, Green Mango, Fresh Peanut (3-piece)]
- i found this a bit bland and not really 'jerky', but more of a Thai influence

SARSAPARILLA SIDE RIBS [Poblano Peppers, Hominy Grits, Jack Daniel's (3-piece)]
- very tasty - fall off the bones goodness. the sides complimented the pork well

SPICY BRUSSELS SPROUTS [Tamari, Maple, Sambal Oelek (serving for two)]
- i like the Brussels sprouts a lot - would order them again

All in all, I had a good experience at the Good Son - both with the food, service and overall ambiance. 

FYI: It's recommended to have a reservation setup beforehand. 

I think most would find the prices a little steep, but that's what you should expect with any place in the neighbourhood..."}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday night as a group of 4, we stopped in for dessert and drinks around 9.30PM. Had a great time and awesome service - the server gave us lots of recommendations and spent a lot of time explaining the menu to us. We tried the flourless almond cake with gelato which was delicious and a decent-sized portion. Interior is really nice - lots to look at with really tall ceilings, but still feels warm and cozy. Looking forward to going back again for dinner!"}
{"text":"2nd time back and it did not disappoint anyone! We shared the beef tartare (delicious to share), prosciutto pizza (great the next day) and short ribs (good but I doubt I would order them again). I would highly recommend all. Great eye candy too, there's lots of male workers looking fine, which is nice compared to the typical place where it's primarily good looking females next time I'm trying the jerk shrimp"}
{"text":"Their wood oven pizza was delicious! With a great selection of wine and cordial atmosphere you feel at home here. If you're not sitting at a booth be prepared to have a rickety chair though!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch this morning at The Good Son, which is in our 'hood.  They celebrated their first anniversary this month and this is the first time we've been.

We both ordered mimosas .... Gord got an Aperol-Orange and I got a Blueberry.  Yum!

I ordered Southern Fried Chicken.  It was delicious!  The chicken had a bit of spice and the waffles were soft and sweet so it was a nice contrast.  I'd get it again.  I dipped my waffle in the blueberry compote and creme fraiche (it wasn't spicy).

Gord ordered a Breakfast Pizza.  I've never seen a heartier pizza ... there was so much stuff on it.  Gord said it was delicious and brought some home.  He said he'd get it again.
 
Martha was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I went here last night to celebrate a friend being in town. It was all and all an awful experience. We had a reservation which they had forgot about so we stood around for 25 mins waiting for a table. Then we sat at a clearly makeshift table that was cramped for the five of us. The service was awful! No one came to ask us for drinks, it took over 20 minutes to settle the bill. On top of all of this, the food was awful. The pizzas were so salty that you couldn't taste any ingredients. SO DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"There's something this place is doing right - everyone's recommending it, everyone's loving it and there's hype. I just don't get why though. 

I think i'm missing something here. Two visits now (with a many year gap in between), I think the menu is decent, nothing to make me crave a visit back, and the cocktail list is very interesting, but not very balanced in my opinion. The food I have had here was ok. Pizza burnt, things i've eaten before, you get the picture. 

The best part about this place is their bar and the selection they carry. That perhaps might warrant repeat visits from me."}
{"text":"Fun decor. Big space. Green waiter and ill-timed mains :(
Oysters with cucumber was a highlight, as was the Haida Gwaii Halibut. The spaghettini was way too oily - and I like me some oil.  Jerk shrimp were alright, but the mango slaw they came with was better. Decent wine list and good-looking cocktails. All in all, a decent night out in spite of their timing issues. This place probably needs a few more months for its staff to gel."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time last night and it did not disappoint. I am very picky when it comes to pizza. I don't like the doughy crust they serve at Libretto and QMP but love it when it is thin and crispy like it is here. I had the spicy soppressata pizza with the pork belly and lentils appetizer. Overall it was too much food. The pork belly is more of a sharing plate for two but it is so good. The ambience is great. It's clean. The service is excellent. It's well worth checking out. We'll be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Very chill atmosphere and I really like the decor. Beers are around $8. Tried their lager and it was pretty refreshing. 

Grabbed the cheeseburger and it had the softest bun! $19 delicious .. came with fries and overall a good meal!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: excellent, Decor: vintage hipster, Service: exceptional. Food: High quality. I highly recommend the tartare."}
{"text":"My friends and I originally stopped by for a quick drink but ended up staying here because it was such a cool atmosphere. There are a lot of quirky little things hanging on the walls - like the clock wall. Food, drinks and service was great too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went to the Good Son for my birthday dinner.  I live in Yorkville but decided to go somewhere on Queen West that I had never been to before.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was somewhat English rustic I guess I would say--very nice but a little dark.  It was quite busy and a little loud but conversation was easy.  We had the East Coast Oysters and Jerk Shrimp to share for appetizers.  Both were excellent and the service was prompt, friendly and professional.  They had Goose Island on tap which is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I had the homemade Cheeseburger for my main.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare.  The burger is a little messy but it was simply delicious.  The fries were absolutely amazing as well. All in all the three of us had 2 drinks each plus appetizers and 3 mains for about $150.  Given the quality of the food, service and overall atmosphere I consider that money well spent."}
{"text":"Easily made online reservations the day of thru their website. 

Cocktail: My Pimms Cup ($14, 2oz): delicious, Mojito-like drink topped with mint and thinly sliced peach. I would prefer it with less ice and more...content. 

Steak Tartare: The best steak tartare I've ever had. It has a very strong flavor which I had trouble pinpointing. I want to say garlic and onion, but I know how that sounds. It was just REALLY flavorful, and shareable between 2 people, or up to 3. Two of us quickly consumed the initial toasted bread provided with the tartare but still had the tartare left over. Our server noticed and brought over more complimentary toast. Awesome!

Jerk Shrimp: It comes with 3 large shrimps wrapped in fried potato strings, on a bed of slaw. Seeing that we were a party of two, the server offered to bring us four pieces (for $5 extra. Default serving costs $15). This. Is. Delicious. The seasoning has a bit of a kick to it but not too hot. The only point of reference I had going into this was jerk chicken. This tastes nothing like that. The fried strings add a real nice crisp to the succulent shrimp. It looked like it'd be messy to eat, what with having to navigate shrimp and the wrapped strings and the slaw, but it all combined together really well. 

Short ribs with Kimchi rice: Very flavorful rice with standard short ribs. Although the taste was great, it was probably the most \"standard\" offering I tried. Along with everything else we ordered, the rice was a good size to share b/w two. 

I was surprised at the vastness of the space. It's done up very cozily, with dark green walls heavily adorned with grandfather clocks and a mish mash of dinner plates. Seemed like a good date venue. I would bring friends here. 

With 3 drinks b/w two people and the aforementioned, total worked out to about $50 per person."}
{"text":"This is such a hard review to do... I want to give it a 4 star but comparing it to Sabai Sabai, L'Unita, and Gusto 101 (which I gave 4 stars each), The Good Son doesn't quite match up.  It's close but too many small quirks just made it less welcoming and great for me to come back.

I booked on opentable and once arriving into the lobby area, the hostess was quick to recognize us and put us at a table.  I really think it was smart of them to have an actual lobby area and another door for the dining area in Canada.  Not only does this block out the bitter cold wind (never felt it once), it actually keeps the dining space a very nice vibe without having standing and waiting people stare at you while enjoying dinner.  This little thing definitely made me hopeful for a great night... small details make the difference between a great 4 star and an amazing 5 star.  The restaurant itself is impressive.  Open and incredibly intricate fun details... the wall of mirrors on one and clocks on the other.  The beautiful chandeliers... the stacks of impressive bottles in the bar area and the open kitchen with the wood burning stove for their pizzas.  Just give yourself a minute to take it all in... it's a great setting for a night out.

The atmosphere is buzzing cause the music is just a little loud where you do have to speak over it. It's dark with candles. It would be romantic except for the constant music and louder tables who are trying to have a conversation.   So more of a fun vibe.  The tables along the wall are mostly for 4 + people and if you're a party of two... you're mostly stuck with these odds and ends in the middle where you do get bumped a lot.  We were first given the most awkward table in the place... first table in front of the lobby door and out in the open.  Uh no thanks.  We watched as the hostess tried to give that table to a few other people... each saying no.  Funny thing ... seeing there was many other 2 tops empty in the place.

As for the service, this is where the first little misstep starting to happen... our waiter was a bit of a sarcastic jerk.  I'm not sure if he was having an off day or he thinks sarcasm is a great way for \"humourous\" service but it just didn't go over well.  Comparing this to the Michelin Bib Gourmands in Chicago, Gusto or Sabai Sabai in Toronto... this was a definite service gap.  Other places had funny but also welcoming staff.  Half the time we'd actually wonder... did he think he was funny or was he being an ass?  Seeing how he wasn't really smiling with us... I think ass.  Maybe it's cause we didnt order any alcohol... not sure.  Either way, he wasn't welcoming and seeing him laugh and joke around at the bar with his colleagues, it made me realize this was going to be an interesting night.

The other misstep was the food... don't get me wrong, some of it tasted very good.  We got the prosciutto pizza, sambal brussels, scallops, and PB gelato.  There was just something amiss with each except for the pizza.  The pizza was freshly made and served quickly... the pizza had a nice leopard spot to it.  It's thin crust and had a lot of prosciutto on top.  It's slightly more expensive than Librettos but it is somewhat close to it.  The brussels was nicely made ... crispy on the outside but still tender to bite through.  The sauce was interesting... though someone did say it was salty.  And when you get the bottom, oh god, VERY salty.  Maybe they just need to do more tossing so it coats the sprouts more and leave the sauce out of the dish.  The scallops was probably the biggest disappointment... it's under the main section for $25.  I would say the cook who did it... did a great job cooking them.  What was disappointing was that it was 2 scallops the size of twoonies and minimal amount of sides.  Maybe going to Sabai Sabai and Gusto skewed my version of main.  Other places didn't have large portions but still enough to be a main.  I think if they put the scallops under apps, it'd be more suitable and forgiving.  Thank god we ordered the sprouts or I'd be starving.  

Between the poor service and questionable value of food and some unbalanced flavours, I dont think it was at the same level as some other good fun and hip places in Toronto. It's too bad cause there are some great things here... it's just not consistent or good enough to be a 4 star."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner after our daytime wedding. The food was REALLY delicious, the space was lovely but the service as charming as it was, was super slow.

I had the mushroom tagliatelle and it was so over the top delicious. I love mushrooms and this dish was loaded with them. My husband had the mushroom pizza and he seemed to enjoy it, he barely shared!

We happened to mention we had gotten married that morning and the server bought out two gelatos - the strawberry and pistachio - for us, on the house. I thought it was a really sweet gesture. The gelato was super creamy and topped with the most delicious olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt. I enjoyed the pistachio way more than the strawberry but both flavours were on point.

I really hope they speed up service but everything was well worth the wait. I want some more mushrooms now, yum."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group (~15 ppl) for a $50 prix fix 4 course menu. Food was 4 stars but the time it took them to get our food to us brought them down a star. After an hour from placing our order, we still had only received our first course. Smaller tables seemed to be doing better so maybe that is the key. 

I had the 4 pc oysters (tasty and fresh - ask for the homemade hot sauce), watercress salad (basically just a big pile of greens with very little other ingredients), side ribs (super moist and big portions), and the gelato (rich and smooth). I also had an order of fries which were delicious but at $8, I hope they were cooked in truffle oil. 

Overall, great food and hopefully the timing issues will get sorted out in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Really like this spot.  It's great for a couple, for friends ..but not kids.  It has a great buzz but an provide enough ambiance for a romantic dinner.  Food feels Canadian, though Im not sure what that means.  It's flavourful, creative and fresh.  They have great specials which is what I usually opt for so it's hard to recall what's even on the regular menu!

A neighbourhood gem- reservations needed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at the Good Son. 

I love the open space, and the decor of this restaurant. It gives off a really relaxing vibe and it is the perfect dinner spot.

My friend and I were craving pizza so we came here for the wood over pizza's. We ordered the Spicy Brussels Sprout to start and then got the Prosciutto Pizza and the Capricciosa pizza. The Prosciutto Pizza was my favourite because it had Arugula on it and who doesn't like Prosciutto!!! The Capricciosa Pizza was a little bitter for me because of the Artichokes (but still super tasty). I highly recommend the Spicy Brussels Sprout and the Steak Tartar (even though we didn't get it, I saw other people eating it and they looked very pleased LOL).

The staff at the Good Son is friendly and attentive so it makes the entire experience even better. Keep in mind that if you're planning to go for a late dinner you need to make reservations. We went right when it opened (6PM) so we had an hour and a half to eat before all the reservations came in. 

They also have delicious drinks, happy hour consists of $4 off of every drink."}
{"text":"The Good Son is one of those restaurants I'd been wanting to try, so when a friend suggested going there for dinner, I jumped at the chance.

I don't usually talk about the ambiance at a restaurant, but I have to admit the appearance of The Good Son's interior is pretty impressive (and jaw-dropping, frankly). High walls covered in paintings and an eclectic layout, The Good Son is certainly one of Toronto's more unique-looking eateries.

But onto the food. We decided to start with the Steak Tartare (\"Soft-Boiled Quail Egg, Grilled Sourdough\") and I have to admit, this was one of the best versions of this venerable dish I've ever had. The meat was mixed with perfect seasonings and flavors, while the tiny quail egg sitting atop the tartare was an ideal accompaniment. Seriously tasty.

For my main, I went with the Mauna Loa Pizza (\"Smoked Pork Cheek, Compressed Pineapple, Habaneros\") and again, this was delicious. The smoked pork cheek was amazingly addictive, while the other toppings were perfectly utilized and spaced out. (Seriously, this is a problem with a lot of pizzas. The toppings have to be evenly placed!)

I was too full for dessert, but I certainly look forward to returning and sampling their sweet wares."}
{"text":"Brunch was fantastic here. Definitely massive and high quality in terms of food and service. The decor is super cool as well. Only complaint was the waiters - we asked maybe 3 times to move (as it was very dark where we were seated) and wanted to sit near he window. Everyone was either too hungover or too tired to care - but thankfully the manager? Saw that we were alone in the dark and moved us."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant yet. I am here 2/month.

Amazing atmosphere. 

Friendly staff.

I love their d√©cor. When you walk in, you feel like you've entered 1920's. It's awesome.

Let's talk about the food now: prosciutto pizza is to die for. Salads are to die for. Steak & fish are superb. Their Chef Colacitti is a great chef. You can definitely see his passion for food in his food. 

They made a customer for life."}
{"text":"Loved our server. He was super helpful and friendly. The restaurant is cute and there are open parts of the kitchen so you can watch the magic happen.

A lot of the food was very spicy, so not my favorite, but the flavors that I could taste when my mouth wasn't burning was very good.

The spicy sopressata pizza was actually really spicy and I needed lots of water just to get through a slice. We also shared the steak tartare, octopus, and short ribs. Everything was good. I didn't like the warm olives though. We really wanted to order the large format steak, but there was a big party that ordered all the steaks they had for the night. 

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"You know I am a big fan of Top Chef Canada and last season I have been rooting for Chef Vittorio Colacitti but unfortunately he didn't win. But lucky for us. he opened up The Good Son (@thegoodson_TO)

 Chef Colacitti previous resume includes some pretty well known places like Lucien, George and Didier, if he learn anything form those places I am sure this will be an amazing meal.

Love the gorgeous space with all the dishes and coocoo clocks hanging on the wall. Love how it's divided into different area with the leather wingback chair by the front and more industrial metal highchair to the 18 seats harvest table at the back near the kitchen. Love that the table are very well spaced out, no bumping into each other.

Jerk Shrimp $13
~ Crispy Potato, Green Mango, Fresh Peanut
~ This just look so pretty, perfectly crispy potato shell and a yummy perfectly cook shrimp against a sweet juicy mango salad. 
~ It was so good even without the fiery jerk aioli but that completed the dish.

Wild Mushroom Pizza $16
~ Taleggio, Pesto
~ Made in a wood burning pizza oven, the crust was light, crispy and pretty sturdy (no soggy crust here) but the dough didn't have much flavor to it if you know what I mean. ~ Not sure if it was pesto, the pizza felt rather oily and my slice didn't really have any mushroom on it.

Sarsaparilla Side Ribs (Half) $17
~ Sunchokes, Scallions
~ Love the sweet root beer flavor of the Sarsaparilla sauce with the fall off the bone tender ribs.

Steak Tartare $19
~ Soft-Boiled Quail Egg, Grilled Bread
~ No idea why this came last, heard everyone raving about this so we just had to try it. It was delicious, love the chucky pieces with the spicy mustard. 
~ Wish the egg was a tad more runny so we get more yolk to mix up with the tartare.

Cherry Tart $11
~ This took over 30mins to arrive but I did love it with a super thin crust and under sweeten cherry which allow you to taste all the natural flavors. 
~ It tasted like it was made fresh and arrived hot which explain the long wait.

When you enter the restaurant, you will pass by the storefront \"Pantry\" where you get to but some nostalgic items including Chef Vittorio's father's cold pressed Olive Oil. This also double as a pizza takeaway counter.

 Verdict :
~ Love the space here and we really enjoyed our food, will definitely be back.
~ The night we went, they were a bit understaff with our waitress taking forever to come by.
~ The space got rather loud at the end of our dinner when the space was packed."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere.  I was last here on a warm spring day and the windows were left open to the city with walls decorated with clocks and vintage oddities.  Everything about the space has character, it is unique and fun and yet the energy doesn't overwhelm; it is easy to carry a conversation.  I am a huge fan.

My concern, what holds me back from rating it higher, is the food itself. I liked the warm olives but the octopus was disappointing both in the amount offered and in preparation.  I am a huge fan of octopus but it was mediocre and while advertised as coming with chorizo only arrived with two extremely small bites.  I've also had the scallops which were again good but not particularly memorable.   The jerk shrimp were particularly good but note that it only comes with 3 in the event that you are looking to share.  

I've given The Good Son two tries because I really wanted to like it more but, for me, it comes out as just being average when compared to other places at a similar price point in the city."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

Started with the charcuterie and cheese plate - incredible tasting cheese especially that soft brie like one, charcuterie tasted normal. Green bean salad was tasty too. Main meals were the cheeseburger and bulgogi short ribs with the kimchi fried rice. WOWZA. I usually share my food but this time, there was no sharing. I thought the portions would be tiny as with a lot of nicer restaurants but not in this case. I would like some of the fried rice right now...

Bonus points for being able to make reservations, and by the look of it, they accept large parties too. 

On another note: Will Smith, THE FRESH PRINCE  was dining there the night I went. Guess he heard of their good reputation too :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The ambience was great and the decor was so unique! They had a wall of clocks, a wall of empty frames and bookshelves filled with books. It made me think of one of those big houses in movies that would be haunted. I think it'd be scary if I was alone in the restaurant but with all the life and buzz going on inside, it was a very unique vibe! 

The food was so good. We ordered a charcuterie board and pizza. I loved the homemade jelly that came with it and the liver was surprisingly very tasty. It was very rich and very smooth. The pizza we ordered had clumps of mascarpone, arugula, prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes! The combination of it all was so flavorful! 

We also had a wonderful server! He made sure our drinks were always full and went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met! I will definitely be back!"}

This place is my new brunch locale. My partner and I came in for brunch before an excursion to the grocery store. Have you ever gone to the grocery store hungry? You end up with the weirdest stuff, and we weren't going to let that happen... again. We cozied up in a booth, and ordered some breakfast cocktails. I had a spicy Caesar, which came garnished with olives and dill and he had a hot buttered rum. He definitely won the cozy award, since he was sipping a warm apple rum beverage whilst wearing Uggs. Ugh. 

For food I had the lentils with kale and a poached egg add pork belly and he had the apple, bacon and blue cheese pizza add an egg. Both were excellent. Our breakfasts were a little slow coming out (this place is new, growing pains), which our server noticed without us saying a thing, and he offered us each another cocktail on the house. We  had the maple dark and stormy and I had a fresh grapefruit mimosa. This little attention to detail is why this place is a five star establishment. The food and drink is great, so is the ambiance, but they really go the extra mile. Incroyable. 

Who'd have thought such a huge brunch joint on W Queen W could be so hospitable and so cozy? They just made a custy4lyfe."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch over the weekend with a group of 5 friends since other reviews had mentioned the good food. Reservations were made ahead of time and our table was a booth which was nice. A few members of the party were late and we trickled in slowly. From the very beginning we experienced poor customer service. Waiter did not introduce himself nor did he inquire what we wanted to drink. It was like he was giving us attitude and service was just awkward. It felt like he didn't want to serve our table at all. 

The food was delicious, our party ordered the eggs benny, chicken and waffles, and the french toast. All were delicious. However, the service was lacking. Even though we liked the food it is a shame because customer service is also a huge part of the dining experience. This will be the first and last time I try The Good Son."}
{"text":"Not going to lie the decor is very nice and classy. I love it but when it comes to their service, it's horrible. Me and my friends waited 25 minutes for the food and another 10 mins just for the bill."}
