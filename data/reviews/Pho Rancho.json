{"text":"Amazing! The staff is always very accommodating!!! I am a very picky customer as well!! I always get the well done and rare pho and a shaking beef for my boyfriend. I brought my family in a few months ago... All of my family members are pho enthusiast from Los Angeles mind you! They thoroughly enjoyed the food. It's not greasy and packs a flavorful punch! This is my favorite pho spot in Las Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have big servings and I love their Pho Combination with Spring rolls. The staff are very accommodating and they have fast service. They always run out of Boba when I come, obviously a big hit during the day. The environment is clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Do you love pho? Do you live in the Northwest Valley? Yes? Then why are you wasting your time and gas driving to Chinatown?! You can get your fix here. The pho here is amazing. I usually use a generous helping of chili and hoisin sauce wherever I pho, but let me tell you I loved the taste of the broth so much here there was no need. Throw in an order of those deliciously porky ground pork rolls wrapped up with the vegetables and fish sauce to dip in and you are good to go! The restaurant is very clean and the service is very friendly, not like a lot of the establishments you will find on Spring Mountain, which is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Ok so this was my first trip back here after the new owners took over. Me and my sister wanted to order and the one waitress said it would be 15 min. We said no prob and waited.  Two more customers enter and immediately get their orders taken and helped right away. So i asked could we order and yet again i was told 15 min. Needless to say me and my sister left. I will never ever come back here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no clue how the old management was with regards to food quality, but I know one thing: I'm sure glad this place is open.  I have tried a plethora of pho places around the valley, and I have to say one of my favorite places to go is Viet Noodle Bar. No other place had been able to live up to the quality that, in my opinion, is offered there.   It was, therefore, an extremely pleasant surprise when a place only 3 minutes from my home offered me one of the best bowls of pho I have ever had.  The broth had a perfect, rich beef taste that needed no add-ins to improve. The noodles were your standard pho noodles, but with the broth, they seemed elevated to a new level.   My only qualm was that the meats (I got the combination), while delicious, were not as plentiful as I'd like to have seen.   Overall, his bowl of pho was priced like any other pho restaurant, but provided a delicious flavor that few restaurants can.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! We ordered the pork rolls, beef pho, shrimp pad Thai, chicken fried rice, and beef chow fun. It was all delicious!! I'm so glad I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown now! :)"}
{"text":"Its not a great place to eat. I've been here 6 times this last month. Just because I hate waiting in lines.  My 84 year young mother ate her entire \"Tempora\" lunch. She rarely finishes any of her meals. I wanted to try just a little bit too. We have had \"Curry Chicken\" also. The reason the Curry is so bad is that it is prepared after it the order is taken which means you are served with a fresh meal every time. No steam table food here. I've kinda got used to steam table food anyway. All of the food there is excellent. Darnit!!! They spoiled me.  Go to McD.......ds. For the same price you can have a B.. Mac. Or pay more and get a square burger at We..dys.  Don't come here please. It's a secret. I love no waiting in lines. I'm sure once the word gets out that will change. The good places do."}
{"text":"This place used to be our go to viet place in north vegas until today 20 feb, 2015. We ordered the charbroiled beef with steamed rice or com bo buong as usual and saw piece of hair. Normally we dont mind until the second one. Then a third one was found which was as long as my fork. Told the waitress and she apologized and took the hair. she came back later and asked if there was anything else wrong with the food besides the hair. Of course everything about it is wrong! We lost our appetite! We werent even compensated or anything. Its like they didn't even care. Pho rancho just lost a weekly customer."}
{"text":"Service  is good, waitress  was very attentive. Location  is great as there aren't any other Pho restaurants in this area. Food was good... its no \"Pho Kinh Do\" but when you don't  feel like driving down to Spring Mountain \"Pho Rancho\" can hit the spot. Floor leading to the restrooms was sticky... I HATE STICKY FLOORS."}
{"text":"Springs rolls were alright. Pho was a bit too greasy and broth was bland. Service super slow even with only 2 customers already there. Waiter thought he had good memory and didn't write down our order. My pho was missing because he forgot my order. There was only 2 pho ordered.. smh. So had to wait another 10 min for it. Probably won't be returning. Will just drive another 10 min down to spring mountain for my pho fix."}
{"text":"Is this place under new management? The staff looks unfamiliar to me....anyway...  I'm giving them a 4 star only because their smoothies are GOOD! The guy who makes them did a great job!   We ordered #14 pho with extra noodles. I'm sad that the broth wasn't as deep in flavor as the pho places in China Town. It tastes watered down. The broth is what keeps people coming back!   The service is great though.... Wish the pho was better."}
{"text":"No need to drive to China Town anymore for Pho. The restaurant is clean, staff very friendly and the food is very reasonably priced and very good. We had several starters like the pork egg rolls, salt and pepper wings, pot stickers and rice paper rolls and they were all very tasty. The Pho was hot and flavorful. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Convenient, cheap, if a bit eccentric. The egg rolls are nothing to write home about, the pho, even plain, is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed my sliced beef dish, but it was a bit slim on meat portion, not a bad deal given the price.Their bun needed a little more roasted garlic flourish but its almost there. The nuoc mam could stand to be a bit stronger but I guess they want to maximize their potential customer base; personally I have no problems passing for a fish market after some excellent Vietnamese. Have yet to try the Chinese dishes on the menu but they do look mighty appetizing. Service is still getting sorted out but its not bad, just a work in progress. Later hours on weekends as well as offering broken rice would be nice."}
{"text":"Haven't been to too many Vietnamese restaurants, so this review is from the \"average joe\" perspective.   Walked in about an hour before closing, there's a sign that says to wait to be seated, but you really just seat yourself and the waitress comes to you. The menu is very simple to read, with nice big pictures that show what your ordering. The prices are very cheap compared to some other places I've been to, but the quality was the same, if not better. My total came to around $7.50.   I ordered the Beef and Broccoli. The food was great! The broccoli was crisp, yet soft at the same time and the beef was cooked to perfection.   Overall, don't expect too much. It's not a five star, fancy restaurant, but a good mom-and-pop family owned restaurant. Will most likely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Don't know how many times we've been here . . . Pho is amazing!! So glad there's a Pho place so close to home! Service is always fantastic and the food is just as fantastic. So glad they are in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and it was okay.   Food - The combination pho was pretty good. I ordered the pork eggrolls as well, which was okay to say the least, it tasted premade. My biggest complaint however, was the thai tea.. Most of my drink was nothing, but ice! A few sips of it and you're pretty much done! I wouldn't order it again, not for three bucks..  Service - Not sure why, but it felt like I didn't get that good of a service? There were empty booths, but I was seated in the middle of the place. The empty dishes were not taken away and my water wasn't refilled? Everyone else around us had pretty good service and had their stuff taken away and water refilled.. Not sure what was going on, but my bf and I were pretty quiet, we didnt even make a ruckus or a complaint so I don't get why we were excluded? The only time we were noticed is when our food was brought to us and the bill. OH and did I mention the workers were arguing about a money shortage? Yeah, that should not be done out in the open for your customers to overhear.  Will I be back? Maybe."}
{"text":"let me start by saying this BY FAR THE BEST PLACE TO EAT PHO IN VEGAS..... i have eaten pho at many places on spring mtn and around las vegas nothing to write home about folks i never finished it all, that is until i came to this Marvelous place. The Pho is outstanding to say the least i can never have enough the place is very clean and the staff is nice but the food man oh man i cant wait to go there again and again :)"}
{"text":"First, I'll say the food was delicious.  Thai Tea on fleek.  That's where the fleekness ended.  EVERYTHING else was off fleek.  This place has absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  To start off, our water came without any ice.  Then it took at least 10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink and appetizer order.  I'm fairly certain that the only reason our waitress took our order then was because another patron seated near us, who came 5 minutes after we arrived, went to the register to ASK for a waiter/waitress.  The appetizer arrived AFTER our entree and the plate of veggies which always accompanies Pho never arrived at all.  We then waited at least 20 minutes to get a to-go box and check so we could leave. No one checked on us during our meal. I made gestures at the waitress at least twice in that 20 minutes, she nodded as though she would return and never did.    Only when we retrieved a to-go bag ourselves and looked to be leaving did they acknowledge us at all.  Do yourself a favor.  If you like Pho get takeaway at this place, because the service will ruin your appetite."}
{"text":"Very prompt and the food is so fresh. I have had the chicken pho, the combination pho, spring rolls, and Vermicelli pork & shrimp. They have all been good. Wish more people knew about this place."}
{"text":"Love love love it here!!! Great service. All of the employees are genuinely nice and that always helps. I have recommended this place to many people now and come here every couple of weeks. Love it :)"}
{"text":"Food here is very bland... I Don't recommend it!  Not even if you're craving it and don't wanna drive too far.   Pho, uhhh. My 7 year old says it doesn't taste good. I agree. I asked for fish sauce (aka nam pa) but they brought me dipping sauce for egg rolls. They had no clue what I was asking for.  Pork egg rolls, ehhh.  Spring rolls... Why the hell is it so big? Chow fun, wth?Charging ten bucks?! Where's the flavor!? Why does my box look so empty?! I had to drown it in soy sauce! I ordered this based on the reviews (pic) but it doesn't even look like that! Thai tea, the tea to milk ratio is so off!!!   Seriously, idk how this place got four stars! Came here twice and highly disappointed. They're overpriced for the amount of food you get, but taste would make up for it. However, in this case, nope!!! I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The rare steak pho is the best! We always have great service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite photo restaurant in Vegas. Everytime we come here we are greeted and waited on with 5 star customer service!! The normal sized pho is packed full with noodles and meat so you definitely get your moneys worth! And there boba is the Thai tea, delicious! Amazing business"}
{"text":"Not bad for the area. Service is hit or miss, but is always good if the owner is there."}
{"text":"First time here pho was good but definitely not hot enough which didn't cook the steak enough so it was chewy. My husband got the chicken curry and was extremely happy with that. So at least one of us walked out satisfied l."}
{"text":"It's Pho! It tastes great, this place makes it. They don't mess it up.That should be enough."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here in a week. Food and service was great. Happy they're open late on a Sunday. Again, so happy that we don't have to drive to China Town. We had pot stickers, shrimp rolls, two bowls of pho, and it was only $27."}
{"text":"I loved their vegetables w/curry but they no longer have any sort of curry :( very sad. Especially since they assured me it had no meat/meat broth/fish sauce as well.  Their boba is good as well but.. the curry... Bring back the curry!"}
{"text":"we've been coming to this place since they've opened. food is excellent, and a few months back it was taken over by new management.. and since then, the service and food have been the best! the chef never fails to welcome us with his warm smile. i think he's one of the reasons we will always eat here!"}
{"text":"So clean and smells like fresh mint and Vietnamese food. Ordered to go and the portions are huge, fresh and full of flavor! Great to have this in the northwest!"}
{"text":"Waitress wasn't too friendly and slightly rude. They got our drink order wrong but they fixed it. The only reason I didn't rate it a one star because the gentleman named Johnny was very helpful and friendly towards us. They need to teach there staff about customer service. The food and broth was very good  I'll be back for the food but not the service."}
{"text":"First time visiting and won't be back.   Everything on the table was sticky. My hands got crap on them from using the condiments. The seat was covered in food from other diners. I ordered a drink on the menu and was told that no one in the restaurant knew how to make it. The waitress we had could use a lesson in service. She was nice, but didn't really know how to be a good waitress.  I ordered a Pad Thai, but asked for the shrimp on the side. When it came out, my dish was covered in shrimp. I've eaten a gazillion Pad Thais: all over the city and in many different countries. This was the most flavorless and soggy version I've ever eaten. The chicken was really poor quality and I didn't want to take my left overs home. Sooooo disappointing.  My friend ordered the Combination Pho and said it wasn't very good either. The appetizers came out when we were half done with our mains. C'mon! Really?  Such a shame. We were hoping that this place would be a new staple in our lives."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is fast, and the restaurant is clean! That's all I really ask for from a one $ sign restaurant! The beef pho and short ribs were both really good."}
{"text":"Clean place with excellent pho broth. The portions are just right and the price is fair.  The killer is the garlic wings. The staff told me it's the best thing on the menu and that was no joke! Love them!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"ok so i have eaten here a few times and it hit the craving without driving to china town. this is the first time i have been back in a few months. first off i noticed the staff and menu had changed. ordered the egg rolls and rare steak pho same thing i always get, the egg rolls and pho arrived at the table at the same time. tried the egg rolls first they were disgusting not fully cooked, and had no seasoning. definitely not the same as they used to be. i put them aside to try the pho.   the smell of the broth was very different not savory like it was before missing something. the meat was well done (as in not rare) i was tempted to send it back but on a limited time so i tried it. it was very salty like someone added a hand full of salt to it. i asked the server if the owner or chef had changed she said yes then i asked if they used beef bullion powder for the broth instead of making it from the bones like they did before (and like all good pho restaurants) she said i don't know i can go ask. i said please ask if it has MSG in it also it would explain why it was so salty. she came back and said yes bullion powder with MSG in it. which is great as my body doesn't react well to MSG. i paid my bill and left! i will never go back there or recomend this place to anyone again.  hãy cn thn ca các mui  As a trained chef and married to Laos wife i know what authentic is and that ain't it! We never use MSG or bullion to thin out the stock. . and always mince vegetables and seasoning with meat in our eggrolls!  i will pass on the free food and go to viet bistro on lake mead. tm bit!!!"}
{"text":"The utensils, cups, and condiment containers on the table were sticky. The servers were nice, but our waitress forgot to place our order for pork dumplings so we had them at the very end of our meal. The main course came out fast, but the pad Thai was gooey and greasy and did not taste good, the teriyaki chicken was served ice cold though the white rice on the side was cooked well, and the vermicelli noodles were also ice cold served with luke warm pork. This is not an experience we will be repeating."}
{"text":"Great tasting Pho. Received it to go but walked in because there is no menu online. I found the restaurant to be very clean and comfortable (I did not use the restroom), the overall sound/music level comfortable, and the staff was above and beyond courteous and accommodating. I receive my food 5-10 mins after ordering. I would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"We came here, because we found out there was a new pho place rather close to our house and not all the way over in Chinatown. Nice clean place, with lot's of space! The place was run by Chinese and Vietnamese owners. Service needs work, as the wait times were a little long for a bowl of pho and us being the only customers on a sunday afternoon. We ordered pho, the broth was good, amount of meat was decent, but the noodles were hard and chewy. The noodles need a little work, before I come back again. If you're looking for a quick pho fix around this area, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Pho Kim Long but I live by Aliante and I didn't want to drive as far so I found this place on Yelp. Their spring rolls were really good, but their pho was okay. I was excited when I saw they put tripe inside their pho because Pho Kim long didn't have it, but they charged me $3 for extra meat and I feel like there was barely any extra and I found myself having to look for more in my bowl. Their broth to me tasted kind of sweet to me, which I didn't like. Also, my husband and I ordered Thai tea with Boba and their boba tasted mushy like it had been sitting out for a while and the tapioca also had zero taste. It was gross. Service was mediocre. It wasn't a terrible place to eat, but definitely not my go to pho place."}
{"text":"I will recommend Pho Rancho for its cuisine to all of my friends. Legitimate Asian cuisine and the use of fresh ingredients were dancing on my taste buds! I will defiantly return and look forward to the other menu items. #17 was delicious and put me into a great mood! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Was on the way to the Vegas  strip  and decided try this place out .the food was great and service excellent .I would come again.if I was in vegas .I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Hit the spot, not the best I ever had but even at that place it still isn't as good as that one time.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We stumbled in from the street, and were pleasantly surprised by the caliber of food served here! The egg rolls were crispy and not oily. The chicken wings were extra crispy  and the mango salad was a huge portion for $9. (seriously you can feed 4 people with it) my husband got the rice bowl with crispy pork belly and Chinese sausage. The pork belly was crispy on the outside (not though but perfectly crispy) and tender in the middle. Service was fast and friendly. We especially appreciated the fact that out waiter was honest with us. When we tried to order a different rice bowl he said the cook that knows all the sauces for that dish was out for the night and he didn't want to serve us something bad. We will be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim. This is my first experience with Pho and I wasn't disappointed. The Pho Nam was very flavorful, yet light and satisfying. Staff was friendly and price was very reasonable for the amount of food. I will be returning with my wife in the near future."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, we took PHO rare beef steak and couldn't eat it. Broth is made of a concentrate, but not of the real meat. After this soup the stomach very much hurt. I don't recommend anybody this restaurant.I demand to return me money for disgusting food."}
{"text":"It's great to find good Vietnamese on the northwest side.  Finally visited after passing by so many times.  Yum!!!!  Tried the summer rolls...packed full of cold noodles, veggies and shrimp.  Peanut sauce for dipping was just right.  Love spring rolls wrapped in lettuce with fresh bean sprouts.  Spring rolls came hot...very hot...right out of the fryer.  The sides of fresh veggies were perfect.  Has the beef ball pho, split  with my wife.  Plenty to split...taste was yummy with some peppers was just right.  Left with a bill just over $20 (including tip).  Atmosphere was ok, nothing fancy.  Clean but basic.  I think with a little bit of time, this will improve.  Total repeat!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! The staff here is always friendly and take good care of us. The food is fresh and healthy as well."}
{"text":"Very satisfied customer so far. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Special thanks to the owner for my free tea!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed I went in for lunch with my wife we waited for 15 minutes nobody came to give us menus i finally went and grabbed my menus came down waited for another 10 minutes nobody came to grab the order nobody came to check up on us finally I went asked them why they're taking so long she said I'm shorthanded I'm shorthanded while I was waiting somebody walked in went to the counter she immediately grab the order in the system  and when I went to ask how that was all you can order here or you can wait order here we couldn't eat waited for about 25 minutes total decided to leave without ordering nobody apologize or anything like that"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great food, clean establishment and all for a very affordable price. We both had the shredded pho chicken dishes with egg rolls and it was great. I think the misses and I will make this our new Pho stop."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Friendly staff and great service I'm totally coming back!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food for being up north! Definitely making more frequent visits here."}
{"text":"Like other reviews, I am just glad to have a decent pho place in this part of town. The service was okay. The food was just ok. The broth was not quite flavorful enough but it was acceptable. They have a good selection of items. I wanted to love the place but it just does not quite measure up to other places near Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"So they cleaned up the restaurant,  it's once again fresh and clean,  the menu has been revamped and now includes more choices of vietnamese dishes.  I ordered the combination veggie stir fry on rice noodles,  and a veggie egg roll.    The servers are great,  they know the menu inside and out."}
{"text":"Menu is simple, straight to the point and not overwhelming. We had pho special with rare beef on the side, fried rolls and fresh rolls. Food was good. Simple flavors, nothing bad. Thai iced tea tasted like it should, and definitely not watered down which is a plus. Everything tasted good although the pho special didn't have as much meat variety as I would expect, based on many other places I've tried, and I always order pho special with rare beef on the side."}
{"text":"Situated in a small town outside of the strip this place has some of the best Pho I've had in awhile. The broth had that authentic Vietnamese taste that wasn't oversaturated with oil. Only reason for 4 out of 5 stars is that I like to eat at a place twice before giving it 5. Very good first impression though"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying good bye China town hello pho rancho! came in here earlier with my buddy bud to eat some pho for our Halloween hangover, the service was fast! Amazing tasty food and in love with their Thai tea!!! Our server chick was nice so was the water dude ;)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, the staff were friendly and the place is clean. I had the rare beef and flank steak pho. It was pretty good and came with the usual sides of limes, basil, and jalapeño  (other stuff too but I didn't get it). I enjoyed my food and will be back."}
{"text":"My family enjoys eating Pho and this place does it for us.  The servers are friendly and attentive, always a good dining experience.  We've been here quite a few times and had pho, fried rice, rice bowls, wings, and noodles.  Portion sizes are huge!  While I prefer to go to Chinatown for pho, this place is closer to home and not bad.  I've also enjoyed their thai tea with boba."}
{"text":"I had a problem today-- I was craving Vietnamese food but I was in North Las Vegas. My usual spots were in Chinatown so of course, I opened up my handy dandy Yelp app & found Pho Rancho. The reviews consisted of a lot of positive reviews and a couple of mediocre/negative ones. I didn't want to add another negative review but unfortunately, I have to do so after our visit today.  We walked in with no greeting from any worker and were confused if we had to wait for a table or just sit anywhere. Decided to sit ourselves in a nearby booth and waited for a server to help us. We got our menus and decided on our orders but we had to wait a while until someone came. A group of diners who came in after us were helped first and we could not flag down the other server because he was busy preparing a large to-go order for a customer standing and waiting by the cashier desk.  After a few minutes, we finally had the server put in our orders and then we received our waters, which had no ice and were only partially filled up. No offense taken then, maybe he was just rushing.. but 4 more times throughout our meal, I had to flag him down for more water and I had to always ask to have my water filled up to the rim and he'd go, \"To the rim? Oops, no ice. Oops, I spilled it.\"   Our food (Vermicelli Noodle Bowl, Cripsy Noodles and Stirred Beef w/ Rice) finally came, none of which were warm. Our hunger won though so we started eating our semi-cold food and tried to enjoy them. They were tasty but I just could not get past the coldness of the food. The only warm items were the white rice and our waters because, yes, there was no ice in them.   The servers were nice but seemed to need a little bit more training. Perhaps we'll come back again when we crave Vietnamese food again when were up North but for now, we will just drive the extra 15 minutes for good, warm, authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to dine and the service is really good. I went there with the fam and we got seated right away, drinks were brought quickly, and the order came pretty quick. We all had Pho and it was pretty tasty and flavorful. I would go back if I'm around that area. Good place, good food."}
{"text":"Stop by this place to get some take out PHO.  It was delicious. U have never had bad Pho.   Everything was separated for the trip home.  We were able to have the same experience with creating our own style.  There were plenty of toppings.  It did take a little long to get our take out.  People were getting their food before us and they came after us."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if management/ ownership changed with this place. I've noticed that their menu has changed at least 4 times since opening. We usually order pho for take out, but this last time was very disappointing. The portion size was only half the size of what we normally got the last few times we ordered. Plus they gave us the wrong order... We ordered rare steak/ well done steak pho but received meatballs and only 2 pieces of rare steak and well done steak. Guess we have to drive out to china town to get our pho fix now."}
{"text":"Food taste is what you expect from a Pho but what makes it different is the enthusiastic feel from the staff. A place that i would come back to with this 35 degree weather."}
{"text":"The food was good- I had spring rolls and Vietnamese Baguette sandwich. Service was poor and s l o o o o o w..  We had a group of six, there were 3-5 other parties there.  Appetizers came out in 5 min increments, delayed drink refills, I finally got my sandwich when everyone else was finishing up their meals. Paying took another 10 min.    I recommend ordering it as takeout if you go here."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Staff was super friendly, lots of great dishes on the menu and not over priced. Ordered the fresh spring rolls and vermicelli w/stir fried beef and lemongrass. Food was fresh and tasted great! Large amount of food, priced just right. Can't wait to try more dishes from this place."}
{"text":"Excellent broth, good food, exceedingly clean restaurant, and a nice owner - we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I loved it! (Please keep reading)  First time here, I walked in to find several tables not cleared and cleaned. I didn't see the sign that stated to seat one self. So, I walked to the front where the nice guy said I could sit wherever I wanted and that he would bring me a menu. At which point, I got a quick glance of the behind the scene look, yuck.   The gentleman suggested upon request the #50 char pork with eggroll vermacelli. I agreed and quickly looked for others reviews.  Had I not seen so many good looking women rating this joint I would have walked away. I asserted myself and thought, \"No germ a Budlight can't kill\".  To my astonishment, the dish was DELICIOUS. I completely forgot about the messy dining area. The gentleman did begin clearing tables after I ordered.   I would gladly return, the whole dish was scrumptious. I couldn't suck the noddles fast enough, the mint leaves gave it such a fresh taste, yum."}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas and found this pho place nearby this neighborhood.The price is reasonable and food is delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Love me some Pho, but this place is definitely not the place to go.  When entering we sat ourselves as indicated on the posted sign, and we could tell there was something wrong with the AC.  There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the menu and pricing didn't look too bad. They had my favorite Pho with rare steak. Our server Jonathan greeted us, no smile and it seemed like he was not happy to be there (bad vibe). He was pretty speedy and did check back, but his body language and chewing gum was difficult to get past. Our food came out and the quality of pho is way under par. It tasted like it had a beef bouillon base and the steak....well it wasn't rare.  It looked old.  I went to get chop sticks and a spoon and that is when I noticed all of the dead bugs on the windowsill just above the silverware.  I was disgusted at that point, so needless to say I just wanted to leave at that point.  Jonathan ran out check and he was talking to a coworker where he confirmed he was not in a good mood as he was telling his coworker he wasn't happy and used a few f-bombs. I do not recommend this place.  Go to china Town to Pho Kim Long. Same pricing and the food quality blows this place out of the water. Here's hoping I'm not sick in the morning, and I will be doing a first....calling the health department in the morning."}
{"text":"Saw this place while driving back home so today I gave it a shot.   I had the dac diet B1 and my girl had the padtai.   The food came deliciously presentable and tasted great!  Prices are great.   Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place. I was craving pho and was happy to find another option beside Viet Bistro in my neck of the woods. I guess I just wasn't in the mood for the cigar stench emitting from the business next door on that particular evening. Here you won't find a cigar shop next door, but you will find The Love Boutique. So for those of you who want to get your pho fix and pick up some sexy (or trashy) lingerie, it is your lucky day.  We arrived around 7:30pm and the place had several patrons. It is spacious, well lighted and appeared clean. We enjoy the fact that they also have booths -- it's the little things, I guess. The server was friendly, but initially a bit overzealous asking if we are ready to order before we've even had the chance to properly open our menu.   Unlike many other pho restaurants, the menu here isn't 17 pages with 700 different combinations of pho. It is pretty straight forward which I actually like. If you are an indecisive person with an attention span of a fruit fly you get it. They offer pho, vermicelli, several fusion dishes like pad thai and fried rice. Obviously pad thai in and of itself ins't a fusion dish, but it is fusion for it to be offered at a Vietnamese restaurant.  The prices are very reasonable. We had shrimp spring rolls, a bowl of combination pho and pad thai all for $22 pre tip!  The shrimp spring rolls were pretty standard, but enjoyable nevertheless. The pho broth here is much sweeter. It is unlike any other place I have tried in town. I wasn't sure about it at first, but grew to really enjoy it midway through my meal. There was a generous serving of meat in the pho, but the noodles were clumped and slightly soggy/soft. My husband's pad thai was too sweet for my taste. I won't knock stars off for that because I am judging it based on the pho and not filler dishes it offers.  For now, I think it is A-OK and I do intend on going back and sampling more of their pho offering."}
{"text":"Second time at this place and I'm still impressed! The service was much better and the chicken pho still tasted excellent. We tried the fried wontons this time as an appetizer and I must say that they have to be one of my favorites now! It had a very fluffy pastry texture to it, different but good all the same. I'll keep coming here if everything stays the way it is (:"}
{"text":"I was so glad that I discovered this place. I used to have to drive all the way to Viet Bistro because it was closest place to me that was good and jasmine express was ok. This restaurant is big and very clean. I'm not sure what people are taking about when they say this place stinks because it was very nice when I went in. The staff was very nice and I liked the layout of the space. I ordered the combination pho and rice w/ spicy chicken with lemon grass. Their broth was a little sweeter than what I'm used to but still very good and the chicken was very moist. Overall, very happy with this place.          The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is the service is a little slow. It took 20 min to get my take out order and I could tell the people sitting down were thinking the same thing. I didn't mind too much because I'm usually very patient but other than that, I will come back :)"}
{"text":"Lousy service!  Didn' t know if I was supposed to sit myself or wait. Only one table was available, although there were only few customers. Many tables were uncleaned and the server was taking his time clearing them. It took 30 minutes before a server attended to us and gave water. They service to-go customers first before sit-in customers. A group of customers came in and they also had to wait for a clean table before they were able to sit.  But they were given the menu and I was still waiting for one. At that instant, I left but I told the staff that this is the worst service I ever seen."}
{"text":"I don't know what these idiot Yelpers are talking about, this place is great! I got the papaya salad (which you never see at a Vietnamese restaurant) and the shrimp Pho. Both were spot on delicious. They brought out 2 little fried dumplings as an app. That was a nice touch. Service was friendly and efficient. I live in Centennial and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Close by and pretty darn good! Pho Rancho you had me at Hello. If you and I are friends, you already know I'm overly excited we have a pho restaurant in our neck of the woods now! Yes, driving to Spring Mountain was very inconvenient but there really wasn't any other choice for good Vietnamese food nearby. I'm glad to say I can now get my pho fix in North Vegas. And there's one thing you should know about me, I am a Pho snob. So I wasn't expecting it to be as good as my beloved Pho Saigon but what a pleasant surprise for me that it's a very close second. So delicious and not to mention kid approved.   The restaurant itself is very clean, equipped with flat screens which are usually set to the food network. The portions could be a tad bigger but the prices are fair and the staff is very friendly. They will refill your drinks before you happen to notice your glass is half empty (or half full if your the optimistic type). And I also like how they come by periodically to remove empty plates, you don't usually see this type of service at other Vietnamese restaurants.   They definitely have the right idea and will stand out from the bunch. Making sure customers are happy is the best way to ensure they will be back and often. Case and point, the restaurant just opened in November and I've been back twice and that is only the beginning. 4 solid stars. ; ) PhoLife."}
{"text":"New ownership and now my 2015 review just doesn't sync up with our recent visit. Yes, they were gracious with extra appetizers and drinks because service was slow. Yes, we had a sweet server and the people working there were nice.  But sadly, no, we did not enjoy our orders. And there's the rub. The food in a restaurant still has to do the talking for the place.  Our favorite go-to when it's hot outside is something grilled. So we ordered the bun tom thit nuong, the chargrilled pork and shrimp over cold vermicelli with a green lettuce base. We also tried their cha gio (eggrolls), which should be a slam dunk at any Vietnamese restaurant. We were so disappointed here. The cha gio was passable, but we've had better and the dipping sauce was diluted down to no personality. The pork should have been well marinated in a good sauce, thinly sliced so you can easily eat it with chopsticks, and grilled to a nice char. They should have been, but they were not, although there were grill marks on one side of meat.  The pork was in large chunks and did not taste marinated at all. The shrimp was not memorable. The pickled radish/daikon and carrots should have been julienned or maybe even grated, not cut like french fries. And the nuoc cham--the sauce than can elevate nearly any dish--was watery and oh so bland. (Sad sigh.)  We were prepared to celebrate that this place had reopened. We did not celebrate and we won't be back."}
{"text":"So much flavor, nice and quiet place to eat pho. The waiter greeted us once we walked in and I had the chicken pho. It's nice and flavorful without adding any seasoning to it.  This place is bomb!"}
{"text":"Just like all the previous regulars I was so happy to hear they had opened up again. Sadly, it isn't the way it used to be. They don't have an online menu, so guessing through an order on the phone was rough. The menu on the yelp reviews is the old menu. The food is not the same. Fresh spring rolls only come with shrimp and doesn't have any noodles in it. It's 90% romaine plus skinny shrimp slivers (almost seemed like they took one shrimp and sliced it into three).  The pho broth was bland. Our fried noodles were super soft and clumpy.  The only redeeming points were the free drink and an appetizer. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Amazing food in moderate prices. The restaurant has a variety of items other than Pho. The list of appetizers has a great choice to start with. This place also offers a great list of juices and smoothies. Lots of seating, very spacious, clean and very friendly waiter. Definitely returning back."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Clean. Service is pretty slow. Definitely not authentic Vietnamese but fine if your in need of a quick fix of pho. Pho isn't as flavorful or full of beef + noodles as you would find  in china town."}
{"text":"We came here because we were craving pho and we were very disappointed in the service and the food was the worst Vietnamese food we had ever eaten. The pho smelled bad and tasted bland and the spring rolls were tasteless and were made way too big with no Vietnamese mint like how it's suppose to be made. The dipping sauce was more like peanut butter and wasn't a sauce at all. Overall this was a total fail on this restaurant. People were waiting over 30 minutes for their order and the quality has slipped from when they originally opened up."}
{"text":"Really good stuff. Living up to the hype! Staff is really welcoming. Food is great, good presentation, good portions and best of all really fresh. Now we need more asian foods here at northwest. We need korean bbq, ramen places, etc."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food. I'm giving it two stars because I would still like to try the food. We came in around 7:30 pm on a Saturday and were seated right away and given menus. The server left us for about ten mins and returned to tell us that it was going to be a twenty min wait for food because they were receiving a lot of phone orders. That was fine by us, but then he left, didn't take a drink order or food order even though we knew what we wanted. We waited about another 15 mins with not even a second glance and got up and left.  Maybe will order pick up next time since service is awful."}
{"text":"Food is great!  We usually would go down to Chinatown to get good Vietnamese food but this pace does justice to their great distinctive cuisine and flavors.  The plus side is that is close to our home.  Service could improve though.  That might the reason why some people don't come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were recovering from the stomach flu, and we were SO hungry. I used to eat Pho all the time in San Diego when I was hung over or had a cold, and the soup would usually lessen sick symptoms. I had a weird pain in the back of my head from throwing up so much from the stomach flu the previous 4 days, and once I finished my bowl of Pho from this restaurant, the head pain was gone. My boyfriend and I have gone here regularly since, and all their Phos are tasty. My favorite is the Chicken Pho and the mixed Pho that has beef, tripe, and meatball looking stuff that Idk what it is, lol. They also have the BEST garlic wings. And they have boba!!! (bubble tea) The staff is nice and the restaurant atmosphere is relaxing. The prices are also pretty good and reasonable."}
{"text":"There Pho soup have sweet flavor, is not taste good. I order avocado smoothie with pearl is not taste good at all, I believed they use imitation avocado."}
{"text":"I was passing by this place on my way home and decided to give it a try. Turns out this place has one of the best rare steak and meat ball soup! Would definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to go back when I'm back in town. :-)"}
{"text":"First time coming here!! Location is great, and very very clean!!! Staff was super friendly!!! If you don't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for PHO I recommend  this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to eat here again for lunch. The Pho here has improved from previous visit. The broth was not too sweet and tasted good. I still prefer the savory broth at Pho Saigon 8. They were generous with their rare steak and brisket. We still did not care for their pork fried egg rolls, too much pork with no vegetables. We also tried their lunch specials of teriyaki chicken and stir fried beef. The beef was outstanding, very tender morsels of marinated steak. They are still working out the menu but I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Well, I could say that the service is awsome with nice staff. it is improved much more when comparing with the previous times. In addtion,theor beef ball is very yumi. I was there many times and the last time is four months ago. However, there is a disapointment in me and my wife. We have 2 orders with No 19 and No. 20. When my orders was brought out, we have a feeling that there is something wrong with the way the cook a bow of Pho. First, when we tasted the Pho's soup, we easily figured out they made the soup from Beef broth in stead of slow cooking the beef bone. Second, they were missing some ingredients in their soup like grilled ornion, ginger, cinamon ... That changed the taste of Pho as I know. Third, the soup is too salty, It might be happen at the end of the day (I was there in the evening). I'm sorry when I rate you guys two stars, because I really want you guys need to improve your  cooking way. I hope you will have a better Pho soup,  and I will be back to support your business."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pho let me tell you it is the best Pho N Las Vegas has to offer .....definite worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their house fried rice! Friendly, clean and reasonable asian food.. It's not only Chinese food, but thai, japanese, Vietnamese.. And all delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! I definitely recommend I didn't really look at there menu so much but they do offer hot plates as well. My pho was just so tasty!"}
{"text":"Nice for us to not have to drive to china town when we found a great pho tai near the NorthSide. We have been looking for a pho place with boba smoothies like this"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The pho has that fresh beef soup that tasted so good I couldnt stop sipping! The gyoza was also the best tasting one I've had at restaurants. The place is really clean and the service is pretty good. The water isnt the best but it tastes better than most restaurants at China Town. I may just have found my new pho spot up North."}
{"text":"Service was slow in the beginning. Dirty dishes all over the place. However this was disregarded with TWO free appetizers and HUGE portions of the most amazingly delicious Pho! This is worth coming back! Customer service at its finest.   Turns out they were short staffed this evening. Hence the tables not being cleared when we came in."}
{"text":"Clean, nice, quick service, and delicious traditional Vietnamese and Asian cuisine! My boyfriend and I are from NY and we've been in the area for almost a month, and we've been here twice because we love it so much! Wouldn't highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hmmm...not sure what's going on today. I sat and waited for a minute But no greeting or anything. I walk by the counter to use the restroom and there's a new guy working. I ask him if I can just order from the register. He tells me it's gonna be awhile. I asked...what do you mean awhile. The restaurant was half full. He replies, \"I'm not gonna lie. It's really busy. I'm about to walk out. I'm the only one right now..It's gonna be awhile.\"  Ummm...didn't look that busy. I saw a guy in the back separating napkins. I asked who he was and he said he's a cook...ummm...this is a 30 top place...  Won't be back until they get new servers and new cooks...   Bye"}
{"text":"Loved it! I would say this place is the best pho place in northwest vegas! We ordered spring rolls and I ordered the special pho with everything in it. We will definitely come back again for sure. We also loved that they gave us a pitcher of water because between my husband and I, we normally drink 2 pitchers over dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great, ordered the combination Pho and everything was great. The soup was nice and sweet, as a soup with beef should be, the spring rolls were great as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good and close to my place. I seemed to have caught a little cold and figured some good ol pho would help me out. Service is quick and I didn't have to wait long for the food. Had the spring rolls and #21 pho. The peanut sauce that comes with the rolls is just tasty. Perfect thickness. The soup itself was very tasty had a good amount of meat and noodles. I had to ask for extra basil and jalapeño but that's just me, since I like all the extras in my phone. The broth was a little too, sweet, for me but all in all still good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and understanding staff. I always get exactly what I want. :)  The spring rolls and the chicken pho are my favorite things to order. All of the vegetables served with them are very fresh and they give you big portions for the price! Flavors of the pho can be made very spicy or very bland depending on  what you like...   I recommend everyone try out this spot"}
{"text":"Craving for pho & I found this place here in NLV nearby my house, usually we go to chinatown. The place looks clean & big. I ordered the rice pot w cured pork & sausage but disappointed when the cook came out & said their out of sausage  but promised to give me extra pork belly & he did i think. My son & my husband were happy with their pho soup & their garlic fried chicken wings & vietnamese egg rolls were also good ordered by my other son. The place wasn't busy at the time we were here but the server must be tired because he almost forgot my son's side order of rice, then we were done eating & my kids are still waiting for their smoothies, he was so preoccupied, lol. We had to remind him when i was asking for my check & finally clicked to him that he forgot to make it... Nevertheless the smoothies were good!!!! And the chef came out with slices of watermelon to make up & apologized for being out of sausage with my order. It's a nice place considering it's close to my house rather than going all d way to chinatown . I would probably give 5 stars if it wasn't for some shortcomings.."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here and they were super nice and friendly. Even offered me a drink while I waited for my food! How many places do that nowadays?! So refreshing. The place was clean and my food was packaged very nicely too. It gets better! The Pho was still hot when I got home and it tasted great! Definitely will be back for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Searching for a PHO place near NLV, and we saw this place.  The rating from the other customers didn't disappoint.  This is a good and delish place for a PHO place.  The ambiance is also outstanding.  We love this place, will definitely come back.  Ms. Tina, the lady who showed us to our seats is sooo nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I was not immediately impressed by the pho when I got it was not very hot nor the bun both were sub par and the Vietnamese egg rolls were placed on a wet plate so by the time we received them on one side of the egg rolls were soggy I have been here before and I was not impressed then either,the music in the place was obnoxious rap crap (drake) my little girl doesn't need to be listening to when at a family restaurant,the advertisements read #dontgotochinatown but I recommend #goingtochinatown From now on"}
{"text":"We've been to many pho places around town. This place has the best tasting pho in vegas. We got a take out chicken and steak pho. And if you ever got take out pho you'll know that it taste like crap usual. But this one was delicious. All the stuff was super nice and friendly. The place was clean and up-to-date. And best part is it's only two minutes away from us. I think we'll go there for lunch today now that I'm thinking of pho again."}
{"text":"I bought a certificate from Restaurant.com claiming I could order $30 dollars of food for $15 dollars.  I called ahead and ordered $30 dollars for pick up. When I arrived to pick up my food I was told that they could not honor this certificate. I was informed that the owner was attempting to withdraw there offer from Restaurant.com. Yet, am standing at the counter with the certificate on my phone. So how is this my problem? The staff was very unprofessional and unsympathetic in helping me. I paid the $30 for my order and waited for about ten minutes for them to finish cooking my order. I was not offered anything to drink or some type of discount.  When I received my order and was walking out the door. A male server yelled from across the restaurant, \"Not to come back.\" Come again what did you just say? As you can imagine this situation now escalated. I walked to the counter with my $30 order and demanded a refund. The entire time this male server stood there with his chest puffed out and wanted to fight me and was yelling at me. I am retired military and served 25 years and stood there and bit my lip NOT to go all medieval on this Vietnamese punk."}
{"text":"Great service and the best pho on the west side. They have a great menu, every time I try something new and so far no disappointment"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of deliciousness! I must say the curry shrimp is my favorite menu item. Everything about the dish is just perfection. The spice, shrimp and potatoes are so tasty. If you haven't tried curry this is the place to try it. The portion is also filling enough for 2 ppl.  The staff is also very friendly. I love coming to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened, they used to be quick and great food/prices.  They've changed their menu, raised prices, new staff that seems confused, extremely slow service and dirty.  The food is ok.  Disappointing that this is the only pho I can find near me..."}
{"text":"I got the Vietnamese eggrolls and the steak pho...it was so delicious and had so much flavor. So much more than I was expecting. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 or 5 times and every time they missed something on our order or was out of something, and was really slow.  I would not mind too much if the place was packed and really busy, but when we went we were either the only ones there or just a couple other people that were already there before us that were about to leave.  The food here not too bad when eating there, but we did takeout just recently and the pho just tasted really nasty for some reason.  This place is only  a few minutes from me but I will not go back anymore. There are better places less than 20 minutes away that have better service and better tasting pho and other dishes that I would rather go to."}
{"text":"The Pho wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either.    I had the #18 Cooked and Rare Beef Pho.  There was supposed to be rare and cooked beef in it.  It only had some very overcooked, shredded beef.  It shows the picture as a nice slice of beef not shredded.  Also, there was no rare beef in it whatsoever.  It was not very appetizing.  The broth wasn't bad..  Pho Kim Long is better by far and I use them as a baseline for a good Pho for my review here.  Service was great and the place is very open and clean.  I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"I came here for the pho..... obviously and it is my new favorite pho place to say the least! The broth I found perfect not to sweet, not too salty and they had a pretty good assortment of meats in the combo pho however, I wish it had more tendon personally, it had a ton of meatballs, and only 2 large pieces of steak. The only thing I didn't like was it had a lot of cilantro. As we all know you either love cilantro or hate it. Usually everywhere else I have been I have tolerated it in my soup but they put just a tad too much in mine giving it a slight dirt taste. That was however, easily fixed with the soy sauce and siracha sauce I always like to add to my pho, YUM!       As an appetizers we got the pork dumplings, very very good! They weren't too greasy and were crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.       Now my brother got the Thai beef salad. Who would get a salad at one of these places I don't know but my brother did. Of course he wasn't pleased he said it was very (fresh) meaning a ton of vegetables fresh crispy vegetables lol. And he said the Thai beef they put in was very good but there was nowhere near enough for the amount of veggies and salad you get.       Also the place was pleasantly spacious, clean, and our server Patrick was a sweetheart!!!       I will come here again but only for pho and I wanna try the other appetizers, negative on the salads I'll pass."}
{"text":"Had the pho with the brisket it was delicious and my son had the chicken noodle soup which he devoured perfect for a cold and rainy day, they were pretty busy and kinda forgot about us for a while when they realized they were very apologetic and gave us free  thai tea wich was good too. Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Will not be going back to this place. Ordered the Combo Pho which was ok. For the appetizer we had the shrimp rolls. They had a slightly funny taste to them, but I couldn't figure out what. Later towards end of our meal one of the servers was cleaning the tables with GLASS cleaner. And that's when I realized what my shrimp rolls tasted like."}
{"text":"Overall I would say that the food is good, service wasn't bad, the only problem I have here is the serving size. I had the beef teriyaki and had only 6 small pieces. Only have soda out of a can. If the servings were larger it would be 5 star for sure"}
{"text":"I would definitely say that I rank myself above average in the understanding of Asian food in general. Unfortunately, I would say that I rank for Rancho Asian cuisine as a much below average. Everything just did not hit on the right cylinders. We'll start with the eggroll. That was the one thing that was decent, and it all went downhill from there. We ordered the Bun Thit Nuong with Egg Roll. The fish sauce; bland. The charbroiled pork; so so. There was no cilantro. Pickled vegetables weren't pickled. One order had one single piece of jalapeño and the others did not. The fish sauce had zero flavor. Overall the dish was very bland and disappointing. This review does not rate the pho which of course their name is referenced, but after tasting the lack of flavors I would assume they can't get this right either. #micdrop"}
{"text":"My first time coming into this place it was empty at 430 in the evening. Majority of the family I came with are vegetarians so we all ordered the vegetarian pho with the vegetarian spring rolls. First disappointment was that we couldn't get spring rolls because they ran out of cut Tofu (but had regular tofu for other items) second disappointment the waiter tells us they are out of vegetarian broth. Hmm why wasn't that said in the beginning? Now our time and yours is wasted. Then he asked us if we could eat shrimp?! I really wish and hope restaurants venturing out on their own can learn to educate themselves on what vegan, and vegetarian means. This was a place I brought my family before work and ended up not being able to eat anything because I was running late. Hopefully if this place doesn't get shut down they build better customer service and educate their employees about the menu options"}
{"text":"I would consider my family and I regular customers. Normally we go during evening hours and there isn't a complaint except on few occasions the food comes out with excessive fat on the meat.   This time around I went in the early afternoon there's no customers but two workers. One female and one male, they both see me and my son walk in but they stand behind the counter jibber jabbering away. Ten minutes go by I start questioning what's going on considering I've come here on a normal basis and service is normally good. Well... I'm still the only customer and I finally here the male ask his coworker if she dropped a menu and her response was no I've been right here with you. He finally comes by after another 5 minutes and drops a menu. I stop him from departing the table and ask sarcastically \"oh my are you both so busy?\" To see if he is aware of the restaurants surroundings that I am the only guest so it did not make sense for such slow service to even receive a menu. He says oh no we were just cleaning.   Well thank you for your honesty but here's a tip, your priority in hospitality is the guest. It would be different if it were bush and dishes needed to be cleaned in order to serve guests but this was not the case. I then politely ask him will you not be taking my drink order? He replies \"what no you see what I was fixing to do was get you water and be right back\" and my response was \" why would you bring me a beverage I didn't ask for, proper service would be to greet a guest for acknowledgment and atleast ask what they want to drink instead of just assuming. He then decided to get defensive and claimed it wasn't like that that he was just gonna get it and he didn't know. At this point I am unimpressed with the service. I decide to give this guy anther shot since I've come here often... Service throughout my meal was just poor. He took forever to get an empty bowl that was asked for. I ordered a rare steak pho, this is a normal order for me. I now have an expectation and familiarity on how the rare steak pho is served here. Let me tell you, I've never had rare steak so disgusting and with so much fat on it. I've never even had fat on it before. It cooked in the broth but the texture was unbearable that I just took it out of my bowl. I'm drinking my water and I look inside the cup and its filthy!!! I'm in shock now because I waited 15 minutes for a menu when I first sat down because they were cleaning so why is my cup so filthy?  I'm ready for the bill so I've set everything aside I'm looking at the server and he's making eye contact but during my whole visit he was sitting in a booth with his female coworker and a cook. He drops the bill finally I immediately put money and lift the book upright so he understands it's ready. He just looks at it and proceeds to sit in the booth while they chat away.   For being more in the local area I want to leave a few pieces of advice to possibly help these employees.  1.) greet the customer no matter what (We understand if your busy just let us know you see us) 2.) ask the customer what they want to drink do not assume and do not argue 3.) don't sit on the job especially in the restaurant field. This is so unprofessional 4.) do not take smoke breaks in front of the restaurant were guest can see you and where we enter and exit, go to a designated area because we can see whether you wash your hands or not if you walk in from your smoke break and go to a table 5.) learn proper server etiquette PLEASE   I am completely disappointed by the service here and the food that I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the smell, this place smells like food. Not cigar smoke, grease trap, or sewer. It is clean, the staff are friendly, and (if you live in the NW of Vegas) it's close.  The Ph? is outstanding! The broth alone was delicious. But the portion was good size and HOT like ph? should be.  I can't wait to come back and try other items, but I will definitely be back for the Ph?."}
{"text":"I consider this the best pho without going to china town and usually love this place but we went in here today and ordered 2 bowls of pho. There was literally only 4 pieces of very small steak in my pho and the same with my husbands and a unnecessary large amount of noodles. It looked like the owners were there today, with possibly a different cook then when we usually go in. I was pretty upset because I left feeling like I got ripped off and with an semi empty tummy."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant lacked in keeping up with its opening standards. I've been back at least 2 or 3 more times.... First of all on one is ever here not a good sign, secondly it doesn't seem clean anymore either. Thirdly and last the food isn't as good.                                                                        The main reason I really don't want to come back is I ordered the spring roll appetizer, the rice wrap on was old and rubbery like it was pre-made. I love fresh spring rolls when they are done right. But this eww it grossed me out, I ate my pho but didn't enjoy anything with the memory of the chewy, dry rubber thing they had just fed me. I'm sorry we won't be back to see if it's any better or worse now."}
{"text":"I was happy to see Pho Rancho open again so I don't have to drive all the way to Viet Bistro for work lunches. However, I'll probably be going right back to Viet Bistro because this new incarnation wasn't even half as good as it once was.   I was seated quickly and the waiter was very polite and friendly. I ordered the fresh rolls to start, though I was disappointed they don't have a vegetarian option anymore. The menu said the fresh rolls have pork and shrimp but only shrimp was present. The rest of the roll was incredibly bland, consisting of lettuce, bean sprouts, and noodles. The peanut sauce it came with had shredded carrot in it, and I think they could have put the carrot in the rolls instead. Cilantro and/or mint wouldn't hurt either.   I usually get the vegetarian pho because I just never know what expect with meat. However, I saw their picture of the beef stew (#20) and it looked delicious. The noodles in the picture were thick and the description said egg noodles so I went with that. When the dish arrived I noticed they were the standard thin rice noodles that usually come with pho. I had to scrape them off the bottom because they were stuck to the bowl and each other. The soup was thicker than pho broth, and had a greasy mouth feel. The flavor was good though. My main issue with the dish was the amount of fat in it. I pulled chunk after chunk of straight fat, not even attached to a piece of meat. I thought for a second that it must be some sort of vegetable because there's no way they expect someone to eat all of that fat? There was still a decent amount of stew meat, but I was turned off and didn't eat much more than the noodles. I would have at least taken the fresh rolls home in a box but they didn't seem worth eating again. I may give this place another try for vegetable pho but I don't recommend the beef stew. Sadly it seems a lot has changed food wise between the last time Pho Rancho was open and now."}
{"text":"Finally a decent pho place on this side of town. Every pho place has their own recipe and concoction for their pho noodle soup, and they have a great balance between. Savory and sweetness, add a chunk of lime and a few slices of jalapeños and I have my cravings suppressed.  Spring rolls were alright with too much lettuce. Otherwise this place is my new pho hangout."}
{"text":"I'm glad there's a new pho place near my mom's house! The pho hear is actually really good and the broth is nice and tasty. I've had a lot of pho in my time, and this one sure is one of the best. Not only is the pho good here, but the wait staff is really nice too. The owner Masa is really kind and welcoming. Thanks for the great food! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has changed since it opened. Not the same people working there. I came in because they were so nice. Now, it's just a place with ok food. The food is not the same when you order it again, and not for the better either. I will drive to Spring Mountain for Pho. I thought I found a good place to come to, but, I don't like the change:("}
{"text":"Pretty decent Pho and Vietnamese dishes.  Staff is very friendly and service is good.  This is more of a place you come to due the conveyance of the location if you live close by and are craving Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was BAD.  We were told 15 minute wait for food.  More like 20 to 25.  There were only 3 other tables with people,  and they were waiting as well.  We were there at lunch time 110pm didn't leave until 215pm.  After setting food down our waitress disappeared, 15 min went by then another customer came in and basically went up to the front to find her. We were already done and out of water to drink, then I had go go to the front to get check and pay.  She was very apologetic, \"Sorry for the wait\", heard that about 5 or 6 times.   Stop being sorry and stop living in the kitchen.  The 2 star rating may be harsh because the food was good.  But you pay your money for the service.  The experience put a damper on an otherwise nice day with my daughter."}
{"text":"This place is good, no joke!   I ordered the Rare Beef with Noodles soup   ahhh it was delicious. The beef finished cooking just right in the hot soup. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times already and yet my order have been brought to me and it was the wrong meal that I have ordered, this place also charged me an extra meal that I have not ordered. it's going my last time coming here and my kids don't want to come over anymore cause the meals are all wrong and they are tired of waiting for the right ones to come."}
{"text":"It was good when it first opened. As time went by, price increased, different workers, service is okay. Dont try their smoothies/boba. It was really bad. I rather go to Spring Mtn for it. Now it's just a disappointment....."}
{"text":"I'm glad to finally have a quality Pho shop in the NW. We've been here a few times and it's always good. The soup stock is awesome. The Chinese menu items are also very tasty."}
{"text":"This is our second time here.  The pho is awesome but the dumplings were some what cold..again.  The service could have been better, they definitely struggled as the place got busy. Over all the food is good and we will be back."}
{"text":"The Thai tea on the menu says $1.50, but it's actually $3.50. They \"ran out\" of reg milk so my only option was soy milk which doesn't taste the same. The portion size was great, the food was steaming hot. The quality of the chicken in the pad Thai was poor, all dark meat fatty and tendon... just yuck. I'm not a big fan of the worker with the huge hair. I feel like women's hair should be pulled back, in a hat or hair net. When there's no business the workers sit out in the booths on their phones."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Enjoyed it thoroughly during my short stay in Las Vegas. The waitress was very nice as well."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3/5 only because they keep closing down...What is going on with this place?? It was closed, then re-opened. Now it's closed again?!?! They have the BEST pho I've ever had and I can't seem to find anywhere else to even come close to it! Very disappointing that they doors are closed...AGAIN. Hoping they regain their business and open and for good!"}
{"text":"The Eggrolls, garlic wings, and dumplings are super tasty!  Pho broth is a bit on the sweeter side which I like, and they even have smoothies!"}
{"text":"My second time here but this time we wanted to try eating here instead of to go.  Food is good but service isn't as well as their pho and spring rolls... Dayshift servers left already and my husband still didn't get his extra order of beef. I would recommend for you to take your food to go.  The male servers are more attentive so try eating during dinner instead. The food hit the spot and portions ate still good. We will try again but to go."}
{"text":"I just want to update my review to say on the food side, this place is very good. All except for the thai tea with no ice, because the server did not know how to make a thai tea with light ice.  good food, shitty service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to different places that serve pho and hands down this is the best one! Everything else we have tried is amazing there also. We finally found a place we can stick with and its clean! Marvin I believe is his name, is so friendly. Thanks for great service and great food!"}
{"text":"First and last pho experience. Very unprofessional, we asked many questions about menu items not ever having pho before I wasn't impressed to be told by our server after our food arrived and we were not pleased that she \"prefers ramen bar\" and gave us the location. We might have had a better experience of the food didn't have a ton of grease and tasted like old meat. Not looking to try pho again after that experience."}
{"text":"Wow, so very yummy! We started off with A2-rice paper rolled shrimp and veggies. Very fresh and came with peanut sauce.   I got grilled shrimp, pork w/ rice vermicelli and veggies and asked for peanut sauce. Lov having lettuce with noodles. Husband had beef meatball noodle soup (pho) which he loved especially with the hot sauces.   The extra napkins came in handy."}
{"text":"I found this place to be ok. Not the best pho I've ever had but not bad either. The service was a bit slow. 1/3 tables there during an off time for lunch and it still took ten minutes to be served drinks. The spring rolls were good, my son ordered some dumplings and liked them. We ordered some beef pho to share and it was just ok. Felt like it was missing something. With a really good pho broth, you shouldn't NEED the sriracha and hoisin to give it flavor but even with the sauces it still tasted like it was missing something. The noodles were stuck, per other reviews, I now understand what they were talking about. They were so hard to eat! Lol. The slippery plastic chopsticks were difficult so I busted out my handy dandy wooden chopsticks (I ALWAYS keep a pair of chopsticks in my purse, they come in handy so often.) and even with the wooden chopsticks I was having a hard time. I tried a fork and still no luck! Just felt like it took forever to eat my food.   TL;DR Not bad if you are in the area or don't want to drive. Noodles in the pho are super sticky and hard to grab with plastic chopsticks, wooden chopsticks and a fork."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new pho spot since it's right by the house! #winning  Service needs some work. The food took a while to come. We never got checked up on while eating and my water never got refilled! We asked for the check and she made us wait about 10 minutes just to give us our check.   The food was delish! I got my regular pho tai (rare steak and noodle soup) and I'm normally pho picky but this one was good! The egg rolls were okay... Maybe I just love pho Kim longs egg rolls. My boyfriend got the shrimp and pork vermicelli and he loved it!   Despite the slow service we will definitely be coming back because it's the closest decent pho spot to home! Also, it's a little cheaper compared to pho Kim long-- which is where we usually go for pho!"}
{"text":"We were thankful a full restaurant was Close to where we are staying! My kids and I were really excited!   I ordered the well-done steak pho and there was a lot fat and the noodles were harder than I am used to but the broth flavor was good.   I ordered the shrimp fried rice and paid nine dollars for six pieces of shrimp.   We ordered the shrimp Rice paper wrapped rolls and the rice was pretty chewy and lacked flavor that was a disappointment.   We were in the mood for pho and it was nearby so that's a plus... and it was good but not the best pho we've ever had.   They do have free Wi-Fi you just have to ask for the password."}
{"text":"I gave Pho Rancho Asian Cuisine a one star -- .5 star for service and .5 for taste.   First, the service was terrible. The inside was fairly large and a big sign says, \"Please seat yourself\" as soon as you walk in. I went in and it took 5 minutes before anyone brought a menu to me. At that rate I expected water to be brought as well, but that took another 5 minutes. Keep in mind that there was only one more table with customers besides us. The server was not nice, didn't greet us when we arrived, and never checked on us. He took the order, gave us our food, and I had to go up to the counter to pay. Wow.   Second, the food DID NOT make up for the terrible service even though the ratings were high on Yelp. I'm guessing the only reason the ratings were good was because Northside people HAS NEVER tried real vietnamese food from Chinatown or anywhere else in general. We order pho dac biet and there was NO FLAVOR. I feel like they just added beef powder with water and called it pho OR they watered down the real pho soup. Regardless, I was very disappointed. I couldn't even finish my meal.   By the way, you cannot order smoothies, dessert drinks, or any drinks on the last page of the menu that includes milk. Because they ran out.   Moral of the story. If you are craving vietnamese food, please go to Chinatown or somewhere else."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go to this place all the time, there's a waiter in there who reminds me of an Asian Mark Whalberg I think his name is Keith, he's always super friendly very prompt. I love coming here and my girlfriend makes me take her here all the time. No complaints from me!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 more chances .I was very disappointed . The prices went up and the soup doesn't have good flavor anymore either. I also got a drink , that tasted  awful. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We went to have some pho last night.  Now I'm still somewhat new to pho only been to a few in town.  Got the combo needs a lot more tendon and tripe or just a bowl with tendon and tripe.  The flavors were simple and the sauces at the table made it so I could spice it up to my liking.  It is the best one I've had on my side of town but not the best in town.  My youngest got a chicken noodle stir fry that I thought was awesome but he only wanted the chicken.  I like this place will be coming back sometime."}
{"text":"Still gonna stay at 3 1/2 stars.  Went in to Pho Rancho again a few days after the first visit to have some Asian eats.  This time around we tried a few different dishes which were overall still just OK.  House Special Fried Rice - Seasoned Jasmine rice fried with chicken, pork, shrimp, scrambled egg, peas, carrots and green onion.  This was delicious!  Great balance of salty, tart, sweet, tangy, all in one bite.  Exceptional fried rice, made very well and fresh.  Down side?  Portion!  Made for little people or people adverse to carbs!  What am I?  Like five years old?  I am not a petite!  Feed me!  We stretched this portion of fried rice to feed three people, but I wouldn't have a hard time imagining this could barely feed one.  The pile of fried rice was pretty small.  Shrimp?  Man, there was like MAYBE four shrimp in the entire serving.  They weren't jumbo shrimp either.  Only change to this dish I would make is to include a LARGER portion for the price.  Curry Chicken & Shrimp w/Rice Noodle - Noodles flavored with curry, sautéed with chicken and shrimp, onions, bell peppers, green onion, and bean sprouts.  I love curry and this dish just didn't fit the bill.  I was probably expected something this dish wasn't.  So dry!  I should have asked if the curry was a curry SAUCE, instead it was more of a curry seasoning.  Curry spices all cooked with the rice noodles, and not much in terms of moisture!  They were dry, hardly any oil or liquid used to make the dish.  If you don't like curry, you won't really like this dish because the spices tend to be strong.  This was no exception.  I can handle the spice, but I can't handle the lack of moisture.  A drizzle of olive oil?  A splash of coconut milk?  Would have helped get this dish on the right track.  Another gripe?  Portion!  I swear, Pho Rancho might have hinted we go on a diet or something.  Pretty dish, tiny portion!  This could barely feed one average sized person.  Not to mention, skimpy on the shrimp as well.  Are we in a shrimp crisis?  I found four shrimp in this dish, among a spattering of chicken pieces.  Not my favorite dish of the night.  This go round, food still average and needs some tweaking.  The House Special Fried Rice I would definitely eat again, it was yummy.  Just needs to be a bit more substantial.  The Curry Chicken & Shrimp w/Rice Noodle?  I don't venture I will have that dish again anytime in another visit.  Just didn't meet any of my expectations.    NO Curry, that's PHO-SHO."}
{"text":"If you have ever had authentic pho before, this place is NOT for you! The broth is incredibly dark, and tastes like canned beef broth.. The noodles are super tough and feel more like the consistency of al dente spaghetti than rice noodles. I would NEVER eat here again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"The food is very good. Prices are standard but I feel slightly high based on the fact I wasn't blown away by anything we ordered (5 different dishes). I don't like saying it but the service was quit poor.  We had to ask for more water and spoons (we ordered soup!).  There were 2 servers and only about 4 tables in use."}
{"text":"I come here often for their Pho simply because I live very close.  The wait staff are nice, the establishment is well maintained and the pho is good. Iv tried other items on the menu and always find that it is extremely oily.  I constantly think to myself, gesh I'd like some entree with my oil.  Will return, but only for the Pho"}
{"text":"This place literally has the best fried rice you'll ever eat. The only time I've ever had fried rice better then here is when I was in Hawaii.   The funniest thing is that when I told the server that, She told me that the cook was from Hawaii and these were all of her recipes that came with her from the islands.  Everybody here is always super friendly and the service is extremely fast. I highly recommend this restaurant for their food first of all, which is completely delicious.  Secondly, the price is very reasonable and the portions are huge.  Thirdly, everybody here is extraordinarily Nice and they have very prompt service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not as good as the last time we ate here. Papaya salad not good; nothing but carrots and bean sprouts hardly any papaya and shrimp looked old and flat not fresh. Also sauce containers on table were dirty looked like not cleaned in a year!  Very disappointed. Not recommended anymore."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. When we walked in there was one other group in there. The server seemed overwhelmed with just that and we had to wait for a few mins before she helped us.   Ordered the egg rolls and pork dumplings for an appetizer. They were good but he egg roll was dripping in grease. It also looks like the oil in the fryer more than likely has not be changed in awhile due to the color being really dark.   My wife ordered chicken pho. It was really good she said it was the best she had in awhile. You of course get all the fixing to add in as well.   My son got the shrimp pho. The only complaint was that the shrimp were all shelled still and he had to peel the shells off. He said it was good though and this was his first time trying pho.   I ordered the well done beef pho. The soup was good and had a nice flavor. The beef was absolutely disgusting. It was very fatty. I don't mind eating fat sometimes but every bite had a lot of fat so I stopped eating it and ate the rest of my wife's chicken.   The place is clean and good just don't really care for fat on my meat. I will recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Close to my house so it's very convenient when I want some Pho. The service is great, staff is very nice and the food came at a reasonable speed. The food is very tasty.. love the spring rolls and sauce. It's very clean and quiet. They have a variety of boba selections that I really like."}
{"text":"Ok food Pho Kim Long is way better quality of food. I would not return here. Prices were good, but food was not as good as I have had at other places like this."}
{"text":"Pho Rancho open again. Quick service and very friendly.  it's 93 here and I still love my pho!"}
{"text":"This as my second experienced eating at this establishment and unfortunately, I haven't been impressed. Costumer service was decent, always respectful and timely. Unfortunately,  it's the quality of food that called for only 2 stars. We ordered the special combination pho and flank steak pho, which we will get to. The first thing to come out (as always) was the vegetables. The bean sprouts were soft, the basil was browned and withered. The noodles themselves were very bland. The broth was flavorless (practically watered down chicken broth). The memet was dry and fatty, while the meatballs tasted like they were soaked in fish sauce. Definitely wouldn't recommend the place to anyone. The Viet Bistro on Lake mead is like a dollar more expensive per bowl, but 100% worth it. Definitely worth the 3 minute drive for genuine Vietnamese food and hospitality."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp pho to go and when I got home, it was still hot & tasty.  All of the sides were included and nothing was missing.  Enjoyed my pho in the comfort of my home!"}
{"text":"Soo disappointed I came here before and it was great came again by myself and it was the worst customer service ever and the food was horrible their excuse was it was a new chief crazy very very disappointed"}
{"text":"The Pho and service was EXCELLENT!  Third time was the charm!  Tonight my hubby and I brought my brother- who was very impressed with the food and service!  It was delicious and very happy with dinner tonight!  This is definitely our go to restaurant for Pho in the Northwest Las Vegas!!!  I will let all of my friends know this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Their hashtag is dontgotochinatown. Which at first I was excited to try a good Vietnamese place without having to drive all the way to china town.   Unfortunately, I did not feel that their flavors could compare to your typical Vietnamese place. Some of the pros of this place is that they have a very modern decor and the service is perhaps much better than most.   Their menu has a good amount of options from Vietnamese dishes to Thai dishes. They also carry a good selection of boba drinks. But If I have the chance to go to a different pho place I would probably do it.   Again, decent food but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Got the B3 pho. Well done beef pho. Noodles are great and soft, broth tasted great. Also had all the extras to put in. I like to make mine spicy. Great place and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"First time here and really loved the genuine  flavors, the price, and the atmosphere! Will be back pho more."}
{"text":"Their Pho is delicious, great for a hangover day or a cold day. Their wings are my fav and so are the spring rolls. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great local place when you want Vietnamese food. Inside is clean and service is good. The Pho broth is good and approved by my kids - the pho connoisseurs.  The appetizers are also very good - personally my favorites are the Fried Tofu with salt and pepper (dau hu rang muoi) and the chicken wings!  Glad to find a local place that serves good Vietnamese food in the northwest area."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has changed cooks or something . The flavors are not the same and very salty. We would like to revisit soon, giving this place another opportunity."}
{"text":"Co-worker was craving pho, so we found this place on yelp.  I think the one thing we probably enjoyed the most here was their egg rolls which was very yummy!   The place was really clean and the service was decent.  However; from there, the experience was less than what I was sort of expecting.  The pho was only a little warm when it came out and before I was done with it, it was relatively cold.  No utensils were given, but I got up and got some, which was fine..I guess.  No sauce dishes were given either, which is odd because they're usually on the tables with the spoons in like a rack next to the napkin dispensers.  Restaurant was incredibly cold and my legs were chattering because of it.  Maybe that's why my pho was colder...Maybe set a thermostat to adjust according to the climate outside.  *side note- TV was playing some Hawaiian Program which had ill-proportioned aspect ratio which was annoying to look from time to time.  This place seems to have a lot of potential, but has a lot to improve on.  I hope it does well."}
{"text":"This place is a great local pho stop! The staff is very nice and always courteous to us. I usually stick with the rare beef and chicken pho and haven't been let down. The appetizers* like potstickers and spring rolls are also great! Currently they are adding boba smoothies and drinks to the menu too! We will keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Have been here multiple times and each time, the service was great, food came out fast (and it's usually PACKED), and the food is SO GOOD. Love the pho (obviously), the spring rolls & potstickers, and the chicken and shrimp curry. Oh, and their iced coffee is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Super great place. Food was good friendly people. We ordered take out and while you waited they gave his ice tea. They alway make you feel welcome when you come in. Place is very clean. You have to come and eat here."}
{"text":"Pho Rancho is the best Pho restaurant in Northwest of LV. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. Food is so delicious and price is cheap. For sure I will come back with my family to enjoy the food again."}
{"text":"My NY relatives were in Vegas this past weekend and accidentally stumbled upon this gem! I decided to submit this post because they weren't amazed at the glamorous hotels on the strip but Pho Rancho Asian Cuisine! They haven't stopped talking about the amazing variety food they had. Pho, fried rice, teriyaki, tempura and curry all in the same place and all delicious!  This will definitely be on my must visit list for our next visit to Sin City!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see a pho place has opened up so close to me, and even more excited to see a really high rating on yelp! Before visiting, I did see some lower rating reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyway.   Came here with three friends. Three of us ordered pho and one of us ordered bun. The menu is limited so we were surprised that they didn't have chicken bun. We were at that point the only table waiting do food, but it still took them at least half an hour to bring out the food. They actually forgot the bean sprouts and veggies, I had to ask, and the waitress didn't even apologize for the oversight. They actually forgot my friends bun, and the guy bringing out the dishes actually asked out of surprise if she ordered something? As the rest of the dishes were finally brought out.   The pho tasted decent, nothing extraordinary, but not bad either. We were just turned off by the fact that the noodles were all stuck together in the broth. We were able to use our chopsticks to separate them, but that wasn't the point. And of course the entire time no one checked on us, we had to ask for our water to be refilled, and the only time anything was done quickly was in the end when we were served with the bill.   Wouldn't come here again even if it's practically walking distance from my house! I would much rather drive down to china town. Just too bad though, I was really hoping this place would be awesome and in my neck of the woods! Alas, it was too good to be true!"}
{"text":"Had the rare beef pho and it was very good.  We took it to go and they packaged everything so nicely - all the accouterments you could want and it was very tasty and satisfying.  My husband is going there weekly now for lunch.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and we ended up getting a cold while we were there.  Decided to try some pho and we found Pho Rancho on Yelp.  The place was clean and prices are fair.  The pho broth was a bit salty.  The pho came with sprouts but only one sprig of wilted basil.  Coming from Hawaii we are spoiled by our local pho restaurants and the local vegetables.  Overall the pho was ok.  The garlic wings were also good.  Customer service was good."}
{"text":"I'm still hungry!!!  Ok so let's see. Located in the plaza just after the Bank of America off of Ranch and Craig, this spot is not hard to find. Has plenty of parking.   Open and very clean inside, and not so loud. It is a seat yourself establishment, so seat choice is all yours. Our server was great, friendly and attentive.   So why the 2 stars? All soup broth and no meat or noodles.  What ordered :  2 number 19s one with no tripe   I got 3 small pieces of rare steak in my soup and 2 tendon pieces. Noodle was the serving size of a small bowl in a large bowl. For $7.95, this portion was way too small to even enjoy. The sad part of the meal was having to watch my wife slowly eating when usually she would be finished before me.   So to keep this review as short and empty as my stomach, I'd say come if it is a last resort. For us it's the closest to the house, so we'd really have to be feening to try and enjoy another bowl."}
{"text":"It is decent. I feel like the only Asian in the place every time I go eat with my boyfriend. This is just down the street from our place so it is very convenient when my pho cravings hits. The location is kind of awkward, well I think that entire plaza is awkward . make the most of the space I guess. Its it right next to the love store. Service here is awesome. They are really friendly. It isn't as clean as it used to be when they first opened but I don't really expect much from small Asian spots. Food menu has changed a few times already. Don't get any of the hot/rice pots. Really just heats up a clay pot and throws in rice and what ever meat your ordered. Not what I'm used to getting when I get those back in Garden Grove/Westminster where the rice is actually cooked in the pot so it builds a nice crunchy crust of rice. The boyfriends like ordering the vermicelli (I think of it as a rice noodle salad with meat) they don't add as much lettuce and cabbage but the meat that comes with it is always good. I like to steal a few bites here and there from him. PHO .... it will do. The broth is beefy. But I feel like its missing something, I don't know what it is. But the broth is just a-ok. Its neither bad or great. They do give you a lot of noodles with it. And I don't really eat all the meant though so I can't say if it comes with a large portion.  The rice dishes are not bad either. Its a-ok. I will keep coming back but just can't give them more than 3 stars. I hope they stick around, I hate driving to Chinatown just for decent pho."}
{"text":"I'm SOOOOO happy some Pho opened up closer to us!   We tried this place out today because we're feeling under the weather, and nothing soothes the soul better than Asian soups!!  The Pho here was delicious. We had the shrimp and beef. We ordered take out. They have everything separated for you in bags and containers - perfect.   The broth was very tasty. And as you know, this is everything for Pho.  The beef was nice and sliced very thin and the shrimp was cooked but tasted fresh.  There isn't much else I can say because Pho is good or Pho is bad.   Ready to go back and try out some of the other dishes they have. Especially for the prices they charge. It was only $15 for two large portions of Pho."}
{"text":"This is NOT a 4.5 star Pho spot.  Who the hell serves pho broth that's not piping hot??  Look at the picture...not a hint of heat coming out the bowl.  Pho Tai ($6.95): Rare Beef Noodle Soup. Simple...broth was not HOT enough, and too SALTY without a balance of flavor depth....just salt.  Noodles were clumped together (due to broth temp) and difficult to eat, with a meat portion a bit lacking. So disappointing!   We also tried the Spring Rolls ($5.95). Smaller shrimp, tasting almost unseasoned, but plated nicely with a well rendered peanut sauce.   We were also served our soup without vegetables, and our hot tea (asked for at initial seating) did not arrive until after 2 additional requests...received after our vegetables, which were served after our pho hit the table.  I'll gladly drive an extra 10min to much, much better Pho for the same money.  Pass!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a rainy day. Perfect weather for a yummy bowl of steak pho. It was so delicious and the employees here were so nice. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to several pho restaurants around the valley, and I have to say that this is by far my favorite pho restaurant. If you're in North Las Vegas like I am, this spot is very convenient since you don't have to go all the way to Spring Mountain just to get some good Vietnamese food.  Pho Rancho is very clean and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure everything was in order. The pho was very hearty. I don't think I've been to a pho restaurant that was generous in their slices of beef. Broth wasn't overpowering or bland at all. I'm pretty sure if Goldilocks ate here she would agree the pho was just right. My father also ordered the grilled beef with rice, which I have to say was very good. If you're familiar with Filipino cuisine it tasted like tocino, but beef. The ground pork eggrolls were fantastic as well.  But the one thing that will definitely keep me going are the prices. I don't think you can beat their price for the damn good quality taste they have. From comparison, I would say they're about $2-$3 cheaper than your average Vietnamese restaurant.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I have been looking for a good place to go for Pho in the north end for a long time. China town is nice but it's a long drive for me. My initial impression with the place was that it was very clean. There are plenty of tables in there unlike a lot of the Asian restaurants in the north end. I got the #12 which is the rare steak, tendon and beef Pho. It was a large portion and it was delicious. The broth had a wonderful aroma and the flavor was great too. I saw in other reviews that the noodles were clumped together and it was in my dish too. It didn't detract from the great taste though. I was promptly greeted by multiple staff members and got my drink and order taken right away. Two staff members also checked on me multiple times. Everything was great and the price for the final bill was very inexpensive for quality food. Eat here now!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Pho restaurant open in the northwest. I love love this place. The Pho is delicious and the chicken wings are out of this world!!!! I try to come here at least once a week. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Can never go wrong in ordering anything off their menu. Love all the PHO!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for lunch. Restaurant was clean, service was excellent. The food was good especially the red curry chicken.  Not expensive at all:-)"}

{"text":"January drizzly weather + being sick = pho time! When I'm sick with a cold, all I want in life is some hot soup. I decided to finally venture out to Pho Rancho to get some vegetarian pho to help nurse me back to health.   VEGETARIAN PHO ($7.95): Many reviews complained that their pho was served warm, but my pho was emitting steam and was quite hot. The pho had noodles, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and silken tofu. I added bean sprouts, lime juice, and jalapenos into the mix as well. The broth is indeed sweet, but not in bad way. I ate my soup until there was no more broth left. Yum! 4/5   BEEF NOODLE PHO ($7.95): Less colorful than mine but the husband enjoyed his pho. He said it was super filling. 4/5  TARO w/BOBA ($3.50): Husband said it wasn't as sweet as he would've liked it. 3/5  MILK TEA W/BOBA ($3.50): The plastic cup the tea was served in was warm to the touch and the beverage itself was lukewarm. It's supposed to be served cold. The tea itself was okay but the boba was atrocious. The texture was soggy, misshapen, and after one sip I wanted no more. I asked if it could be taken off the bill and the manager obliged, thankfully.  SERVICE: We were immediately greeted upon walking in. Our waitress was soft-spoken but really nice. She was quick to get our beverage and food orders. Pho was out in less than 10 minutes.  VIBE: Large, clean restaurant where you seat yourself.  *No refills for soda. It's by the can for $1.50.    Worth a Return Visit? I'll be back for the pho but I'll stay clear of the boba in the future.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #5"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat and found this new Pho restaurant on Yelp literally across the road from where we were. It's kind of strange to see ANY pho in this part of town but it had very good reviews so that was reason enough to try it out.   If you know where the Roberto's on North Rancho is (and if you're local and you don't know then shame on you) then you can find this place as it is in the same strip mall right between a State Farm and a sex shop. Only in Las Vegas. This place has been open less than two months and it looks like it. Everything is very new and clean. You can still smell the paint a little bit.  Service was great but then again we got there right after they opened and we were the first customers. Everything on the menu is surprisingly cheap. Most things were under $8 which is great. The menu is, for lack of a better word, a bit safer looking than most of the places in Chinatown. Most things had some variety of beef or pork in them and about the most unusual thing on the menu was tripe. Basically, being a boring white person, I did not have to guess at what anything was. I get the feeling that they are geared toward the less adventurous diners.    We got the shrimp pan fried noodles, the pork egg rolls and the B1 pho special which has a little bit of everything in it. Currently, Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mountain is my favorite pho place in town. I wouldn't say that the pho or the egg rolls at Pho Rancho were quite as good as Pho Saigon 8 but I enjoyed them all the same. My girlfriend loved the pan fried noodles.   Overall this place is pretty good and I hope they are successful. I know we will be back to try some other things since it all looked good."}
{"text":"It was alright. My expectations were really high, considering all of the 4-5 star reviews they got on here. To their defense, I probably just ordered the wrong thing. I got the Thai Curry because I've been craving it for a while and I was surprised to see that they had it there, and for really inexpensive too (about $6), but when it came out it tasted so bland. There was almost no flavor to it and absolutely no spice. The best way I could describe it to my boyfriend was, its like when you're sick and your tastebuds can't taste anything. And to make matters worse, the lady totally forgot to give me my Thai Milk Tea that I ordered lol. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loved his food. He ordered the charbroiled pork chop and a side of egg rolls. The only negative thing he could say about it was the portion size was super small compared to other pho places like Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long, Pho Mailan etc. If it weren't for how clean the restaurant aS and how welcoming and attentive the staff was, I'd probably give this review lower than 3 stars.  Not saying I wouldn't go back though. If my boyfriend loved it and 13 other people on Yelp love it too, then I'm sure I just ordered the wrong thing lol."}
{"text":"We saw this place was highly-rated when I was craving some Vietnamese food. Well, I was highly disappointed.   I tried my favorites: egg rolls, pho and Thai iced tea...and roast pork belly. Nothing was spectacular. The pho was lacking in flavor and it was only warm so, it got cold in a matter of seconds. The egg rolls were marginal. The roast pork belly seemed like it was nuked in a microwave so what would have been a wonderfully crunchy skin was tough, chewy and blah.  The service was just as bad. Somebody actually left this place because their food took forever. They leave the food on your table but they don't give you utensils...if you ever see the server again.  Drive elsewhere to get a good bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you have a large group! Horrible wait time. That said the food was worth the wait!!! #26 was phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone that has taste buds. Egg rolls were meaty and fresh as well. Overall this is the kind of place you would want to go in small groups."}
{"text":"Best pho shop in vegas hands down. I come from san diego with a heavy concentration of really good pho restaurants and this place is reallyyy goood. Very new and very clean and awesome friendly staff. Will be back forsure"}
{"text":"This is an average score for the Pho and some appetizers.  As far as the pho is concerned 5 stars!   I had the plain pho with no meat.  It was very good and only $3.95.  Fried tofu 2.5 stars wayyyyyyy too salty for my taste. They were $6.95. If you like salty go for it. If they had less salt they probably could be good.   Veggie egg rolls were a yuck for me. 0 stars. I bit one and left it on my plate. The filling inside the egg roll just wasn't for me.   This place was clean and had fast service. They even gave me a pitcher of ice water. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for Pho."}
{"text":"So excited to have a great Pho restaurant in the northwest! Our waitress was very pleasant and the food was great! They started us off with a complimentary pot of green tea, which was perfect for the chilly evening. We started off with an order of vegetable egg rolls. These were awesome! Nice and crispy with a great filling. The dipping sauce was yummy too. My fiance and I both got the rare steak bowl. They added the meat before bringing it out to us, so the steak was closer to medium by the time we started eating it. However, this did not bother us at all once we tried the broth! It is so flavorful that even my fiance, the king of seasoning, hardly added anything to it. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"I used to really like the pad thai here but now it is very inconsistent. Every time we go the pad thai is different. Ranging from moist, dry, different noodles, different ingredients, etc. Today we asked for extra peanuts in our pad thai but they didn't put any at all. I heard that they are under a different management now. Maybe that's why things are going wrong? There has also been a total of 4 times that we've come in & no boba. There is a whole smoothie & drink section broadcasting their boba drinks so there should always be boba. I'm still giving 2 stars because although inconsistent, the pad thai has still tasted ok. Drinks are also good...but would be better if we can finally have them with boba! My family & I will give this place another shot & if nothing changes I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"located past the BofA, around the corner, in the next shoping plaza. another pho spot look jut like the rest of em.  this one is a newer one. nice decor. large dining room. a couple LCD tvs to watch that game u might not wanna miss. wait staff is cool folks. food is descent. they USE MSG ..but a lil wont kill ya.   #10 i their combo pho.  large bowl lotsa meat n stuff inside.  Pork Chop over rice was OK, taste u fine but did not come with the fish sauce and no fish cake on the side PadThai was tasty!!!   add srarcha and ur good to go!   overall:7.5 out if 10 from me. not bad at all"}
{"text":"Again what can I say but awesome pho and the soup is hot not cold like some places and marvins service once again was on point, jus wish they had an xl bowl of pho for option hehe"}
{"text":"North Las Vegas is stepping it up with a few new restaurants and this is one worth writing about.  There are really NO legit pho restaurants in North Las Vegas, so I would say this a great addition to the area.  The next closest spot would be Viet Bistro but even that is a little further away.  So onto the food, we tried the pork egg rolls, combo pho, and charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl.  The pork egg rolls are definitely not as good as Viet Bistro, but a whole lot cheaper.  You really can't beat 4 large eggrolls for $4.95.  They weren't my favorite due to a strange salty/sour flavor.  I'll probably give them one more go, in hopes that it was an off batch.  The combo pho really hit the spot for me...it had rare steak/meatballs/tendon/tripe...all the good stuff.  The flavor of the broth is a tad bit on the sweet side but still very savory.  For $8 a bowl, the price is definitely right for the quantity.  The charbroiled pork vermicelli bowl was very tasty, but a little skimpy on the pork in my opinion compared to other locations.  Also,  I wish they offered chicken as an option instead of just beef and pork.   And where is my favorite bun bo hue....that would really make this place legit...but prob scare the non-Asian folks in this area.  Based on my observations of the staff, they are Cantonese and Vietnamese (since they speak both languages).  They also have some other Asian offerings (like stir fried noodles, curry, pad thai)....not sure if I'll venture into ordering non-Viet or Cantonese items offered.  The restaurant is fairly large and clean...for now.  Good fro groups and they were showing football games on Sunday.  Definitely will be back for a nice hot bowl of pho in the wintertime!  Hope they last in this location, it's a needed addition to the restaurants up North."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho I ever had! The workers are very nice and welcoming!  It was our first visit here and we will most definitely come back. It's a lot closer to our home.  We don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown for Pho.  This place is way better than Pho Kim long N the service is 10x better!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best pho and spring rolls  And everything I try is the best. The people here are always so kind. The fried chicken is a must always. I will always come back to this place I love it so much."}
{"text":"Was very impressed by this restaurant. We ordered a combo, steak and chicken pho. All three killed it! The combo definitely the variety it implies. The steak was great, well done and very tasty. The chicken was awesome! Was served with a boiled egg and shredded chicken. Every bowl.of pho had plenty of meat and vermicelli, even appetizers like papaya salad and chà giò (Vietnamese egg roll) were really good! They have a very large selection, service is great! Best pho establishment on the north side hands down."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We ditched the place up the road and came here. They have a great chicken Pho!!"}
{"text":"We were very excited they opened up a Pho place on our side of town! Nice , clean and friendly staff ... Definitely a great spot to get your Pho fix without having to drive all the way to chinatown."}
{"text":"This was a great find! Love Pho noodles but hate the drive to China town so I tried this place closer to my house & I LOVE IT! The broth was super flavorful, all the ingredients were fresh & the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Vietnamese egg rolls which were pretty good and pho w rare beef and well done beef. My soup was oily but pretty tasty. Not enough noodles in the pho! Clean restaurant and good service."}
{"text":"Flavorless. No limes for the Phô \"because they cost too much.\" French coffee has maybe a teaspoon of condensed milk in it. Fish sauce was so diluted that I thought it was diluted vinegar. Sad! Presentation of food was great staff is pleasant, but the food is deceiving  Sad"}
{"text":"Just left this joint after waiting 45 mins and no food in my stomach. Messed up my order twice in one seating, it shouldn't be that complicated to get a combination pho with no noodles right? They definitely need to have a better system going. I've never had to spend almost an hour to order, eat, and pay for my pho let alone just waiting for my darn order. Smh."}
{"text":"Tried the Pad Thai Noodles! It was AMAZING! Also tried combination Pho & Seared Beef and Lemon Gras Vermicelli! WONDERFUL! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. The pho was average is pretty good in flavor. My boyfriend and I both ordered the three things we normally get when trying a new Vietnamese restaurant. Pho tai bo vien (pho with rare steak and meat balls), cha gio (eggrolls), and goi cuon (springs rolls). The pho had good flavor, I would go back for that, however the eggrolls where not that great. The nuoc mam had a good flavor for dipping, but the filling in eggrolls was not typical and in fact strange. Instead of the black mushrooms, it had a strange and weird tasting white long mushroom. The meat filling would have been good if the mushrooms were taken out. AS for the springs rolls, they were average as well. They had wayyyyy too much rice noodles in it and the peanut sauce tasted like straight peanut butter. I would go back for the pho if I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown and perhaps try something new next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner on Tuesday night. Very clean, large place located near the Love Store in a newer mini shopping mall just south of Craig on Rancho.  Ordered the Pho Nam and my friend ordered the Pho Tai. She said it was too sweet, like they added sugar to the broth. I thought it was too, but I like sweet so it was good for me. Decent amount of meat. We also had the shrimp spring rolls which were presented well but a little light on the shrimp. Overall, pretty decent, not the best Pho in town but not bad for a place in the NW part of town.   Have some dinner, the do a little shopping at the Love Store for your next romantic rendezvous."}
{"text":"what I really liked about this place was thelocation, in the northwest.  As for the food, it was ok.  We ordered the beef pho which wasn't bad except the broth needed a lot of work.  You really expect a tasty broth that would seem like it's been cooking for a few days.  Also ordered the egg rolls.  They had four egg rolls but only two small pieces of lettuce that wouldn't even wrap around one of them.  The dipping sauce didn't have much taste at all.  Guess I will have to stick to Chinatown..."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty good.  Friendly fast service.  Has nice ambience to the place with good lighting and today's hits playing in the background.  Portion was just right.  Not too small or not too large with an abundance of noodles.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and pretty tasty.  The restaurant is very clean and the service is prompt and courteous.  I like that there is a Pho restaurant on this side of town and we don't have to drive to Chinatown to enjoy a decent meal. The prices are very reasonable which gives you the opportunity to enjoy more items from the menu.  This will now my \"go to\" Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Just ate here (take out) and I had the pad tai and PHÒ.... The restaurant was bright and u could tell it was new it was very cute. Service was very very friendly and prompt. Pad tai was excellent everything I expected and I tried my friends beef which was also great... I mainly went there to get phò because we don't have any PHÒ on the NW side and I was sick so phò was exactly what I needed... Boy oh boy was I disappointed!!! After reading all the reviews I was excited but when I opened the container to the broth it didn't smell like it usually smells so I sipped it and it tasted sweet and a little thick disgusting!!! It was also dark brown even though I ordered chicken phò... I gave it the benefit of the doubt and added the noodles and spices and chicken like I like and tried it again but I couldn't bare the smell and taste... Instead I drained the juice and just ate the noodles... Would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible phò... Maybe i went on a bad day?"}
{"text":"Start out by saying the food deserves a 5 rating but they dont serve any alcoholic beverages.   We both had the rare beef steak pho and both loved it.  You must try the house chili sauce (pic attached) with at least one bite;  i ended up just adding it to my entire bowl. Restaurant is clean, our waitress Cassandra was a pleasure, service was fast, will definitely be back. #dontgotochinatown"}
{"text":"The spot was so good.. we are lucky we found it since we are out of townies.   We were up the street skateboarding some sick ditches and had to yelp where's the pho spots.   Thanks for the great pho and all the hospitality.   You rule Pho Rancho."}
{"text":"Meh.  I'd like to use a better word, but meh sums it up pretty nice. I was excited that a new pho place opened up so of course I made my way down. The place looks nice, but that's it. They greeted me and say me an even though it was empty, it took about 10 minutes for someone to bring water and take my order. I had spring rolls and a bowl of pho. The doing rolls weren't good at all and I only ate half of it. The pho was decent, but nothing special. I'd like to say that I'll come back more, but it's about the same distance drive to here from Chinatown. It's not great, it's not horrible, and it's not my first, second or third choice."}
{"text":"Big serving and good service but there pho is inconsistent sometimes good and sometimes salty."}
{"text":"This was on the way home... Soon as you walk in find a table and sit ... The server came over got us our menu.. Didn't ask how our day was or what drinks we wanted.. He came back 7 mins later then got our order.. Still no drinks.. Appetizer we ordered shrimp rolls.. I was happy that the rolls are full size and there's 4 but the sauce was very limited.. All the food didn't come at the same time.. My husband and daughter's pho were nearly done before my rice with chicken teriyaki arrived.. White rice was blah.. And the sauce on the chicken was nothing special.. I couldn't even finish my rice. We had no refill on our drinks and the young guy server seemed like he was having a bad day.. I felt bad for the older lady working cleaning the tables.. She had to pick up his slack.. I'm sorry but I'm never coming here again... We spend $40 for poor service and poor food quality.."}
