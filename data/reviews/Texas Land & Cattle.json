{"text":"Possibly one of the worse meals I've ever eaten.  Took my father there for his birthday.  His steak was so dry he couldn't chew it.  Mine wasn't much better.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Have eaten lunch here several times and always good food and solid service. Last time we went there the service was terrible. Maybe a new waitress or something but she was way off her game.  Our food came out near the end of our lunch break and our drinks were not refilled. I also asked for ketchup and mustard with my burger which I didn't receive until I was almost finished eating.  Then instead of separate checks like we asked for we got a single check and had to wait another ten minutes to get separates.  The waitress did apologize for the bad service at the end of the meal which was nice but awkward.  Once we got back to work the Manager called to apologize since I guess it was obvious that we weren't happy with the service but he was very apologetic and more than made up for the one bad experience we had there. I appreciated his attempt at having good customer relations and will definitely return since they obviously do care about having happy customers."}
{"text":"I wanted not to like the place.  I avoid chain restaurants when I can, but was here on a business event planned by others.  TXLC (as it calls itself), or at least this one, does what it does quite well.  It is not fine dining.  The steaks are not of the quality of more ambitious steakhouses.  The seasonings lack subtlety.  But the steaks are properly cooked to order, the seasonings are good if a little overstated, and the side dishes are tasty.  The sourdough bread served before the meal is delicious.  The service is excellent, as is the bar."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and yet to have a bad steak. It's a step up from your local Long Horn, Roadhouse, or Outback. Staff is professional and the menu contains a bit more creativity than a blooming onion! Clean with professional service at a decent price. What more do you want. I don't understand why people bash a place for being exactly what it is marketed to be. You can't expect to go into this restaurant and get the same menu as Del Frisco's or Capital Grille and still want to show up in your shorts and sneakers and pay the prices they have. Change your shorts for some pants and put on some shoes and make reservations at one of those restaurants and pay the fine dining price. FYI, it's always a good idea if you check a menu out before you go so you don't have to be disappointed they don't offer \"your type of food\"!"}
{"text":"We've visited this location twice in a month and both times the draft beer has been \"broken,\" then they charge 6.00 for a domestic bottle. The food was cold and soggy. And the service was mediocre at best. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food was okay, not overly exciting. The daiquiri was not good at all but they did take it off the bill. Service was good and everyone was very nice. The fried jalape√±os was good."}
{"text":"It started out with some good sweet tea and a nice salad. They used a chilled bowl which is one of the things I desire in a salad. But then it went downhill...  The waitress forgot to bring bread... no big deal, she brought it after we asked for it. It came at the same time as our meal. I ordered the steak and shrimp. Upon first inspection I noticed the steak had a light brown color. I ordered medium rare and they got it right... but I like a little bit of char on the outside of my steak. It's like their grill wasn't hot enough. They had a very peppery seasoning on the steak which got old after a few bites and I had to resort to Heinz 57... something you shouldn't need to do when paying $17 for a steak. And it was the same deal with the shrimp which seemed like they could use more time on the grill.   Overall the meal was probably 2.5 stars... I'd round up if it cost less. But for $25 I don't feel like I got my money's worth so I am rounding down."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed our meal here.. had planned for a steak dinner but wasn't sure where to get one.. put steak or Texas in the Tom Tom and this came up.. we had a short wait (party of 5) but we had a chance to look at the menu.. finally seated.. we ordered drinks and appetizers..   that took a little more time.(they were busy for most of the time we were there).  really good chips and spinach dip.. onion rings where good but the sauce had no flavor.     2 bone in ribeyes , 2 boneless ribeyes and a full rack of ribs ordered..  outstanding on all accounts (died and gone to steak heaven).  The ceasar salads were good as well .  Took home 2 bourbon pecan pie slices.. good but the family said... Not as good as mine.. sorry..   another review elsewhere mentioned that the sweet tea wasn't sweet.. it wasn't. . But it was delicious (some places it can be overly sweet).  Overall I'd say we had a great dinner here. We don't live in the area so likely will not be back.. but will recommend it to others.."}
{"text":"Service was great. My steak was a little overdone, although I ordered medium. My husband's (who ordered the same) was perfectly cooked. Both were very delicious. Fries were great and kids meals were reasonably priced for the portions. Half priced bottles of wine on Weds which is nice. We would definitely dine here, again. Oh, and they'll let you sample the steaks!  Very nice way to decide, if you're unsure about which you'd like!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. Three piece appetizer was very good, especially the spinach dip which is awesome. Our group ordered a rib eye, filet mignon, and the snokeded sirloin which were all fabulous. I would make the 1 1/2 hour drive just to eat there again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were curious and in the mood for a good steak on Mothers Day weekend so we hit up this joint.  For us,it was just okay.  Hubby got a trio of shrimp, BBQ chicken and steak. Surprisingly, he only enjoyed the chicken.  I got the chicken fries steak with garlic mashed potatoes that should've been called mashed garlic with potato seasoning.  All the food was heavy on the seasoning, which I found strange.  The server was friendly and attentive and we were seated right away (5p), but overall I'd prefer Bob Evans chicken fried steak to TL&C."}
{"text":"Great service. Not so great food.  I had the  cowboy ribeye. Which I am well aware is a very marbled cut of meat, but this would best be described as fatty grizzle.  My daughter had kid sirloin that I had real trouble cutting. The best part of the meal was the wedge salad. Overall I would have been happier With a pizza and would have a lot more money  in my pocket."}
{"text":"My Visa was overcharged by $71!  My bill totaled $60.20; I sent my Visa to pay that bill, but when the ticket came back I had been charged $131.31. The other couple who was with us had a bill of $71.11 and they had paid the their bill in cash before I paid mine.  So I assume the waiter, Taylor attempted to reconcile both tickets on my Visa allowing her to pocket the money from the cash bill ($71.11). I discussed this incident with the manager and this was his response \"I'm sure she did not intentionally charge your visa for both tickets, this happens 10 or 11 times per day\".  REALLY you make that many \"mistakes\" a day with customers credit and debit cards--that's unacceptable.  I will never eat here again. I still have $71 tied up on my credit card and the food is not as good as Texas Roadhouse.  Beware beware beware."}
{"text":"Worst place in concord...went there tonight after a wedding we went to waited 35 min to get a burger. When it came it was warm and not hot"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this establishment for the first time and had HORRIBLE SERVICE! 10 minutes after we were seated at our table, no one acknowledged we were there. None of the servers took the time to ask what we wanted to drink or stopped by our table just to say \"I'll be right with you\". I brought this to the attention of the manager, Kelsey, who said it was unacceptable and she would send a server to our table right away. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one came to our table. My husband and I were fed up with the rude service and left. It's just a coincidence that my husband and I were the only minorities in the restaurant at the time. Everyone else was being waited on. We will NEVER go back to this restaurant. I'll be sure to tell all of our friends and family to do the same. The service we experienced at this establishment isn't even worth one star!"}
{"text":"We Tried their carry out before and loved it, so this trip we went to the restaurant. We love sitting in the bar area and this is where we sat. Lots of fun taking to the bartenders and staff. We split the bone in rib eye. It was plenty for my wife and I and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and a great spice rub. Shared the loaded baked potato and salad. The salad was good but not as good as the potato and steak. They had a nice wine selection as well as a nice draft beer choice. Highly recommend if you are near the Charlotte race track."}
{"text":"Not good at all the bread was hard the salad had brown lettuce.dressing tasted terrible. Filet mignon not tender or good at all very dry sweet potato. The only reason for a star at all was the waiter was good. I wanted ribs but was advised against it by the wAiter. I will Not return to this restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"Horrible.   The soup taste like brown gravy, the macaroni was dry and flavorless.  The bone in rib eye at 31.00 was horrible. After i asked for extra seasoning and medium well. Half the steak was rare and still flavorless. Taste like black pepper.  The waitress asked if. Wanted them to put it back on grill. Really."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Friendly staff, but took forever to get our food on a Monday night with only 6-10 people in the entire restaurant.  My wife ordered a sirloin cooked medium well.  It came out way over cooked and tough as leather.  It took so long to get thaf we didn't have time for them to redo it.  I ordered a medium rare ribeye.  It came out cooked to the correct temp.  But the steak was average at best.  No grill sear.  Bland meat.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 with no waiting, lots of different items tried, chicken fried steak looked like the best, nice sized portion good looking gravy the brisket sandwich was good looking but a taste disappointment, pulled vs sliced meat could have been anything, and served with a Carolina BBQ sauce, not what I'd expect from Texas. The ribeye dip was large and tasteless, not sure where the get the meat, looks the part but no flavor to speak of. The Tuna looked great and was cooked to order with a nice mixed greens salad on the side, quite the surprise. The peppercorn ribeye was cooked to order well encrusted with cracked black pepper corns, loaded smashed potatoes were OK, again the beef looked the part but lacked taste. The bone in ribeye was the greatest disappointment, it has grill marked but is very very greasy not what you'd expect from grilled meat. Overcooked and tasyless, hardly worth the effort to complain. The toffee bread pudding was the only item worth returning for, oh well don't waste your time."}
{"text":"A little better than some of the steakhouse chains out there but could use improvement. I had salmon with broccoli, the salmon was great but broccoli was like mush. My other half had a dish with chicken, I don't remember what it was, but he seemed to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Terrible. The ribs were good but my wife's filet was the worst she ever had. I tried this place once before was sorely disappointed. Gave them another chance.  Ribs, filet, two drinks $71 plus tip. What a rip off never again, ever"}
{"text":"We visited the location around 3:30 to grab an early dinner. We and two other couples came in around the same time. We stood at the front for almost three minutes without a soul greeting us. There were two tables in the restaurant, but no server, bartender or hostess could be seen the entire time we waited. We ended up leaving, but I decided to call the restaurant and call the manager. While he was very apologetic and offered to purchase something if we returned, we decided not to based on past reviews of service."}
{"text":"This place needs some work. The booths are dirty and the food leaves much to be desired. My steak and shrimp were over cooked. The lettuce in the salad was wilted, tomatoes mushy, and cucumbers frozen and thawed out. I would not recommend this place. Not worth your money or time. Service and drinks were good."}
{"text":"Now I have seriously high standards for a steakhouse, especially after eating at Prime in Providence, RI where the steaks MELT in your mouth.  I don't expect many places to come close to as good as that. And I have to be completely honest with you, when we walked in and I saw the decor - branding irons, paintings of cattle heards, cowboy boots.. I was a little worried that perhaps we were getting ourselves into something we didn't want. We ended up staying despite the decorations and the loud noise.  We got there about 7:30 and waited about half an hour, which is to be expected on a Saturday night. Our waiter, a very very handsome fella sat us and took our drink order. I ordered the Sangria Margarita, which I won't do again as it was basically red wine and crushed ice. We decided to skip the appetizer and just eat some bread while waiting. The rolls are ok, albeit it was lukewarm and not particularly soft, it wasn't terrible. I ordered the Cowgirl's Ribeye with Garlic Butter and Shoestring Onions, a Loaded Baked Potato and a Caesar salad. It smelled fantastic. The waitress that had brought our food asked us to cut into the steaks to check the doneness. We didn't have to as both steaks, ordered medium rare, were practically bleeding onto the plate. They were perfect.  Keeping in mind that the steak wasn't going to be as good as Prime's I took a bite. I was shocked. It was delicious. Of course, I was right, it wasn't quite as good as P's but holy crap this was a good steak. It was the right temperature, perfect texture, the garlic butter and onions made it even better. My husband was green with envy. His filet was good, but not as good as my ribeye.  I enjoyed the fact that the food is great, dress is casual and the price is right - a little under $50 for the two of us which was well worth it. The service was great, the dessert menu (which we unfortunately had no room for) sounded fantastic and the temperature of the restaurant itself was pleasant (which if you've read my other reviews you'd know is a big deal to me).   I definately recommend Texas Land & Cattle. (Or as my husband kept calling it, accidently, Lexus Tanned & Cattle.)"}
{"text":"Bad. That was the general experience we had at the Texas Land & Cattle. Id' give it 1.5 stars if I could, but it doesn't deserve 2.  We went early on a Saturday evening. The waitress was entirely inept. She showed up late to our table after getting \"reamed out\" (her words) and everything was late. Our French Onion soup finally showed up AFTER we had our meals! she told us it's because the first order had gotten cold. Well, your job is to get our food out while it's hot. Getting our drinks was like pulling teeth. The service to the table next to us was a different waitress, but with the same results.  The food wasn't much better. My \"12 oz\" ribeye was a pathetic 1/2 inch thick steak. So was my son's. The lettuce was wilted, potatoes undercooked and just most everything was pretty bland. The house special sirloin was pretty decent, but that was about it. And the soup - when we finally got it - was probably one of the worst renditions of French Onion soup that I've ever had. Overall, the food was overpriced, poorly cooked and relatively bland.  This place isn't worth your time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there on 6/23/16 around 6:30 pm. Once seated, we were informed that the draft beer system was not working. If I want a bottle or can, I'll drink my beer at home. We both opted to go with ice water. It took quite a while for the waitress to take our order. Once our food came out, I was informed that the baked potato I ordered with my dinner was not available. Then she said she could make a potato, but it would take another 15 minutes. I ordered fries to keep my sirloin from getting cold while waiting for my baked potato to bake. Getting refills on our water was an act of God. All in all was not a good experience.    The only positive note was the smoked sirloin was exceptionally great.   The negatives outweigh the positives. I would not recommend this place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"My experience with TL&C was horrible.   It didn't last very long however.   I went after work for an early dinner and there were about 10 tables in the entire restaurant that had people sitting in them.   The hostess was nice and sat me at my table and then I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited for my server to come over and greet me and take my drink order.  After about 10 minutes, I needed to use the restroom so I got up and went to the restroom.  I came back expecting my server to be ready to greet me and take my order.  You guessed it, no server so I waited, and waited, and waited for about another 5 minutes.  During this time a server walked past me twice and helped two of the tables that were near by me.  I don't do this very often, but I had enough and walked out."}
{"text":"Smoked prime rib and lobster... Nothing more to say than WOOO DOGGIE  If you have not been here, I seriously suggest giving it a try. The service is what took it down from 5 for me.   They seemed to be a little overwhelmed the three times I have been. BBUUTTTT, I will not let that deter me from going back.   That lobster was absolutely cooked to perfection and the prime rib was melt in your mouth good."}
{"text":"First time I have written a review on yelp.  This experience was that bad!   Out of every type of alcohol you could conceive of.  Food took forever.  It was decent though.  Getting check was horrible as my card was ran on my bill and someone else's.  Don't worry though I will get it back in 5-7 days.  With no proof it was ever returned.  Not once did we have a manager come over and apologize or anything.  Zero star rating if it was possible"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of hamburgers in a lot of places,  but the BBQ Bacon and Brisket burger is without a doubt the most flavorful I've ever tasted. The burger was cooked to perfection ( medium ) and the brisket melted in my mouth. The bacon was candied and added an absolutely delicious flavor to a burger already bursting with mouth-watering flavor! If your looking for an absolutely amazing burger, go to Texas Land and Cattle, they will put a smile on your face as big as Texas ! I had the shoestring French fries and they were crisp and delicious as well, fresh and hot, just like the burger !"}
{"text":"The steaks are absolutely fantastic!!  The decor is a western rancher type of theme and it's very dimly lit.  We stopped here around 7pm on a Saturday night.  It didn't take particulary long to get seated, maybe 20 minutes.  The place was busy but it didn't seem to be overwhelmingly busy.  Service though,  was slow.  It seemed to take awhile for a server to come take our order for drinks and then come back for our appetizer/dinner orders. We had about a 2 1/2 hour drive ahead of us and I thought we'd be in and out in about an hour's time.  It ended up being 9pm before we were able to get our check paid and get ourselves out the door.    I ordered steak and potato with a side salad.  The salad was crisp and the blue cheese dressing was very good.  The steak was excellent.  The baked potato was \"eh\" like it had been in a steam table for several hours but that was okay.  The worst part of the visit was partly our own fault, my daughter left her jacket at the table in our hurry to get out the door after we realized how long it had taken to get in, get served, eat and get back on the road.  We didn't realize it until we stopped for fuel about an hour and a half later.  I came back a week later to see if they had the jacket in the lost and found, but nobody knew anything about my little girl's brand new purple jacket.  Nobody claimed to have ever seen it.  4 1/2 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service, 0 stars for the lost and found department"}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO good. The food was amazing (best steak I have had in awhile), great kids menu and wonderful service.  We loved it. We were staying at the Great Wolf Lodge and ventured out for dinner...took a chance on this restaurant (it is SO close to the GWL)..and so glad we did.  Not sure why they have meh reviews on here...it is REALLY GOOD. My 8 year old wants to go back to Concord so we can eat here (forget about Great Wolf! ha!)."}
{"text":"Yes it's a steakhouse but the best part of the meal was the wedge salad, the blue cheese dressing is phenom. The onion soup was good too. But the steak lacked flavor and my lobster was slightly over cooked and had too much \"char\", so tasted burnt. I was disappointed, maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch yesterday, the food was fine, nothing too special as my steak was a bit overdone and my husbands was under but our server was FANTASTIC so based on that I gave this place 3 stars. I have been here before and really had a fantastic meal but this time it didn't quite measure up food wise. I would however go back in hopes to experience the food we had had the first time"}
{"text":"Ate their 12oz Smoked Sirloin. It was awesome.  Tender and flavorful. We ate here for lunch and service was great."}
{"text":"Yay: The wedge with blue cheese is a-maze. Insanely yummy. Servers are friendly.  Dealbreaker: steak is perfect one night, impossibly crappy the next. Service is a crap shoot (although still friendly, yay?).  Last night I ordered a medium-rare 14-oz ribeye. I got a beautifully marbled and perfectly cooked hunk of USDA Choice AWESOME. So tender, so flavorful. The meal made my night.  Tonight (I see you, judgy face!) I ordered a medium-rare 14-oz ribeye. I received a medium steak that was tender and well-seasoned. An awesome meal if you like medium steak. But I don't eat medium, so I asked for a new steak, rare. Maybe the grill dude/ette didn't like that, because I ended up with a flavorless and largely unchewable slab of just-seared...I don't even know what it was. \"Choice ribeye, they allege?\" LOL probs not. What is all that unchewable crap in the meat? EW gross. Where is the fat????? Just a real, real bad piece of meat. Let's just say I once had a Ruby Tuesday's steak that was leagues tenderer, better marbled, and more flavorful than this one. As in I could actually chew and taste it.  Whatever, anyway. So disappointed, so hungry. (Because I am not going to risk the possible consequences of sending back a steak twice.) Hello, who let this person touch the grill? And where the hell are you sourcing your meat, people?   Ugh, off to Five Guys for some due consolation. At least they give you what they say they'll give you. I'd prefer $6 of reliable satisfaction over $22 of fail any day.  P.S. In case it isn't already clear, I am never, ever coming back."}
{"text":"We are the only one sitting at a booth at the bar. There is literally no one behind the bar. We haven't seen our waitress in over 10 minutes. My parents had to get up to find the waitress to get more beer. (Actually we just had contact with the waitress and she was still pssiy at us. Oh, and there's some blonde chick standing at the very end of the bar on her cell phone.) This is just a wierd place altogether. There isn't anyone here as far as patrons go. So yeah. I'm not a huge fan of this place. Good steak though."}
{"text":"Six of seven of us got what we wanted and it was very good food. One of our orders was missed and never came until we told the waitress. But they were apologetic and the manager and waitstaff came out and personally apologized. We would go again."}
{"text":"This is my 1st and last time at Texas Land and Cattle. I used a mobile coupon for a free appetizer from the Survey Mini app and they treated us like criminals because they had never heard of Survey Mini. The coupon was the only reason we tried the place. They came to my table 4 times to verify the app and coupon. We didn't even get an expensive appetizer. We got nachos and cheese. The manager kept eye balling us like we were going to walk out on the check. It was not busy but our server got our daughter's order wrong which I don't understand because all my daughter wanted was a cheeseburger. They brought her a steak. The tea was nasty and watered down. The bread was stale and hard.  The hostesses were rude as soon as we walked in and I think that just set the tone for the bad experience.  Do yourself a favor when you're in the Concord Mills area and don't go to Texas Land and Cattle!!!  There are plenty of other restaurants in that area. If you have to have a steak, Texas Roadhouse is across the street and they have better bread, better service, better food and better prices."}
{"text":"Great place to eat their was 4 of us and And four really enjoyed our meal  the service was great good lace to eat"}
{"text":"We arrived on Monday after a business meeting with 6 people at about 630. We had a drink at the bar and then asked for a table. We were seated immediately when asked but very close to 4 other tables on both sides of ice. I asked the hostess if we could sit at a different table as we were still discussing business, that was a little less crowded. She looked at me rolled her eyes, did not say one word, not one!! Then proceeds to walk to the other side of the rooms, drops 6 menus on a table and again does not say 1 word to anyone at the table that was just getting ready to spend $300. Not a good way to start our evening. Note to management, we just need the staff to make us feel welcome and like you kind of care, that's all, it should not be difficult to smile and sincerely welcome customers if you would like them to come back. My NY strip was cooked correctly medium rare, but the plate was cold, steak was cold, mashed potatoes were cold and asparagus was cold. The lights were full bright which is not cool in a fine dining restaurant and you could very loud music and laughter coming out of the kitchen. Only bright spot was our server who did a very nice job. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"The service was poor and the food was even worse.  Our food came out all together with the exception of our daughters plate. We waited an additional 15 mins for her food so ours was cold when we finally ate.  I never received my salad or some of the sides we ordered, which was fine because it was gross. My daughters steak was way over cooked.  She ordered medium rare and it came out well.  If you want a good steak and good service, don't stop here!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ribs, great experience!   My first visit to Texas Land and Cattle and we waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night with a party of 8.  Waitress was friendly and attentive and our glasses never got even half empty!  We shared appetizers of spinach and artichoke dip and jalapeno bites. Both were okay, but nothing spectacular.  I had the half rack of ribs and they were fall off the bone tender and perfectly seasoned!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Waiter gave me a sample of the smoked sirloin.  Told him I was a ribeye guy.  I tried it medium.  Said it was too chewy but tasty.  Then he brought me another sample, this time medium well.  Melted in my mouth.  I'm impressed -never had it smoked like this.  The Brussel sprouts were disappointing -small and they looked like the frozen kind.  Bread was meh.  But that smoked sirloin was wowza."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. ****Just try not to come here during nascar events *** I'm pretty sure that's self-explanatory."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with co-workers and both times have been super enjoyable. The waitresses are very friendly, and both times the salmon was excellent. It's very well seasoned, as well as the green beans and baked potato that accompany it. You get steakhouse bread for the table that's a mix between french bread, and round white bread. Very soft and great with butter.   Just a note, the green beans are spicy. It was not something I was expecting, but non-the-less I ate all of them."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service the burger was great to the last bit. And the short ribs was awesome. Very tender"}
{"text":"New management have recently amped the place up. Nice friendly blonde manager. Service is excellent. Been there. Few times and you get to know who to ask for (suggestions: lizzy, jessi, Amanda, Jordan. Craig, Kimberly) very busy on weekends. But offers call ahead seating. Wait is usually on time or only a little over. But the place is definitely coming along. Very classy. A lot better than roadhouse"}
{"text":"Food is very good here and worth the money.  They can be inconsistent BUT when I voiced my concerns to management over very poor service and dinner they immediately apologized and offered a free meal!  Crap happens but good places make up for it.    Much nicer ambiance than a texas roadhouse with comparable food."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever encountered.. After an hour of sitting at the table with my main entree still in the kitchen somewhere .. I got up and left.. The manager decided to give me the meal for free.. In which I drive home and went to bed... Ruined my evening plans.. Missed my movie I was planning on seeing with my girlfriend... NEVER will I go here again!!!"}
{"text":"The food for this franchise is great. The location is great, but unfortunately the staff here is neglectful I feel. It may have been understaffed but I don't understand why when I was there is was for Father's Day weekend so you would think a restaurant would be on the'r A game for a celebrating weekend.   Our waitress was nice but she was also working the bar? I have never been to a restaurant the bartender also waited tables; typically the bartender tended to patrons at the bar with food and drink. Ittook a long time to get our drinks- water. Then when we ordered a beer it took about 7-10 minutes after our food arrived to even get the beer.   Not impress with the staff and I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Great service! Got the son of a biscuit chicken sandwich for lunch and it was awesome! Fresh cooked biscuit & crunchy/juicy chicken!Bartender was friendly and attentive! Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic!! I mean best service I received in Charlotte thus far. That's says a lot considering southern hospitality is at it's best here in CLT.   The hubby and I decided to go for the 2 for tweenty something deal. I choose the wrong steak. I failed to notice that it was a chopped steak and not a regular steak. Totally my fault. The waiter noticed I wasn't really eating my food. He asked if everything was alright. I told him everything was fine since it was my fault that I ordered the wrong entree. He came back again in a few minutes and gave me a menu. He said he knew I didn't like my steak so I could go ahead an order something else on him. He even brought the manager over to apologize for the chopped steak. I couldn't believe how well they treated me and how attentive they were. I eneded up ordering their special smoked steak. All I can say is that I was blown away by their great service.   The food is good but the service is what will keep me coming back! Thank you Texas Land & Cattle!!   p.s. the smoked steak was so good! Specilally with a loaded baked potatoe! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair, we didn't get past the hostess stand.  We arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday for lunch.  There were three cars in the parking lot.  We have never been to this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try.  However, we were a bit concerned that it wasn't busier at lunch time.  We walked in the door and we were impressed with the atmosphere and decor.  We waited at the hostess desk for someone to greet us.  As we waited, we saw two servers taking care of their tables.  Neither one of them greeted us, much less acknowledged us.  We kept waiting for someone to greet us, and seat us.  I guess it wasn't the servers job to greet people and/or acknowledge them.  We continued to wait for a hostess and the two servers continued to walk around the restaurant.  We finally decided to leave because if being ignored was any sign as to the service we were going to experience.... we didn't want any part of it.  I cannot comment on the food because as I said, we didn't get past the hostess  stand!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Nice atmosphere and the wait staff was fantastic. I ordered the shrimp and grits which was decent but pretty bland. We ordered a steak as well which was great. What made the meal was the great waitstaff. Food was good, not great."}
{"text":"Hamburger Steak or Chopped Steak to the more classy, was cooked to perfection.  Waiter was perfect and helpful with menu.  Great  service, good food, great table for an all in all 4 star rating.  Good place to go before the race!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice meal in pleasant surrounding. Service was excellent very attentive, knowledgeable and all done with a smile. Steak soup was ok not great and Caesar salad was also soso. When mains arrived another story steaks were very good. Cooked as we wanted and tasty we had 2 different cuts and equally good. The quail got good reviews as well. French fries nice but the steamed broccoli was soggy and without the garlic on it would ave been awfull."}
{"text":"Once arriving- was told by the waitress that she was \"very busy but would provide her full attention to us as soon as she could\" and took our drink order. There was a large table of 6-8 beside us and maybe 3-4 tables with people at them, it was a dead zone honestly. We ordered 2 waters, kids sweet tea, and a beer.  Waitress comes back with a water, sweet tea, kids water, no beer. No big deal.. things happen. We tell her, she fixes it. Order our food (2 steaks and a kids meal) and it takes about 30 minutes to come out. Ordered the steaks medium, came wayyyy undercooked. Rest of our food was cold. Waitress never comes to check on us, doesn't fill up drinks, etc. After waiting about 10 minutes after we are done eating (and there's only one other table with people at this point) we flag down a waiter to please ask our waitress for our check.  She walks in the front door with another waitress and they were outside smoking!  Got our check and we were charged for the adult sweet tea we never ordered. We just paid for it to get the heck out of there... pretty pricey dinner for mediocre food and absolutely horrible service. Oh, and still didn't receive the beer.. Save some money and get better food- go to Texas Roadhouse! There's always a long wait, but it's worth it for the food and service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Seriously. Best service. Best food. Lizzy the manager/bartender/server/everywhere lady is truly a blessing. My glass was never empty. Everyone was super nice. The brownie and ice cream was out of this world."}
{"text":"Great steak restaurant the waitress was very nice and helpful with describing menu items the rice was tasty. I would recommend stopping in for dinner if your in the area"}
{"text":"After seeing some other reviews we were skeptical however the server Brooke was excellent I ordered the filet Oscar and my boyfriend had ribeye both were incredible. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I am from MA. In July 2010 while in San Antonio I stumbled onto a Texas Land & Cattle and was pleasantly surprised. My steak was cooked to perfection.  A couple of months ago I was in Charlotte for a conference. I took a trip to see the race track, and to my surprise just happened upon the NC restaurant. I just had to go, and part of that reason was to see if my memory of San Antonio was correct. Well, it was, Again my steak was cooked to perfection and tasted awesome. Friendly atmosphere, great service, reasonably priced.   Works for me!!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place is empty at lunch hour.  Each time I've visited the staff is super nice, the food fresh and tasty, and how can you beat their lunch combos at $8.99?  Today Hannah recommended a spicy Caesar salad and a 1/2 brisket sandwich.  The salad was crisp with a jalape√±o doing some back talking; moreover, the brisket was smoky, saucy, and tangy.  Hannah was spectacular in her delivery and kept refilling our tea--she's a keeper.  Do you want to bypass the madness at some of the eateries surrounding Concord Mills?  I say Give 'em a Whirl."}
{"text":"We stopped in mid afternoon on a Sunday, they have a nice Sunday Steak 4 course special that we didn't notice until after we ordered, but that's okay... The service was very good, the food was cooked just the way we ordered, seasoned very well ... we'll definitely be going back again, we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since my last visit to a Texas Land & Cattle...and it will be a very, very long time before I return again. Knowing that a large group of us were going to meet here, I felt like a proud Texan to go somewhere with Texas in the name (I lived there for 7 years, how could I not get out without some pride?). However, this place would make Texas ashamed.   The space was great and they had a room reserved for our group. It provided a great intimate setting for us! The service was good.  The food was its downfall. The appetizers were average and seemed factory processed (you know, open the box type). The steak was dry, hard to chew, and salty...blah. For the price per entree, they should step up the quality.   Good night out with the group, great location...not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"I loveeee this place.  We always request Elizabeth (Lizzie) as our waitress because she is so attentive and so great.  The smoked chicken tortilla soup is fabulous, the braised beef ribs melts in your mouth and the house steak is superb.  The drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great for a date night or a family dinner.  I've probably visited this place at least 10 times already and that's in the last 3 months :).  Try it, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"This place is pricey but our food was good  they do have a good location right next to great wolf lodge not to mention it was t very crowded so that was a bonus"}
{"text":"Just came back from TXLC. It was one of the worst dinning experience that I ever had. My wife and I actually went there quite often actually because she loved the Texas bone-in-ribeye. My mother in law was in town so we took her there and ordered the same thing. They both had the bone-in ribeye and I had the regular ribeye. However, as soon as the bone-in-ribeye came to the table, you can tell there's an unpleasant smell when it got close. They smells like they have been sit there unfrozen for a while and rotten, not fresh at all. My Ribeye came out ok. We notify our server and she took cared of it and got us two new ones, but when the new ones came to our table, one of the steak had the same problem again and I was really pissed. I mean....you have to be kidding me if this happens....not once but TWICE.  The manager apologized to us again but she was not very sincere and thought we were joking. This is a terrible place in terms of food qualify and consistency. We will not go back again and I used to recommend my friends to go but please don't go anymore. Unless you are not worrying about going to hospital from food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food is ok and our waitress was not pleasant. I had the southwest grilled chicken salad... Can't really mess that up. Hubby got the brisket sandwich. I tasted it and thought it was awful, he thought it was ok. All you could taste was salt. What are you trying to cover up?! My parents steak, streamed veggies and mashed potatoes were cold."}
{"text":"A step up from your traditional chain steakhouse. Quality of the meat was exceptional, though service was lacking.  Stopped in as we were touring the Charlotte and Concord areas. Tried the shrimp and avocado appetizer and it was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend. Was loaded with shrimp and and has a nice bite to it. Our party ordered the ribeye, filet, and the new hickory smoked sirloin. Very impressed all the way around. Steaks were cooked exactly as ordered.   Now the hickory smoked sirloin is something these guys should be VERY proud of. Ordered it medium rare, and it came sliced in gorgeous pink with the most divine hickory wood flavor popping out of the meat. Absolutely tender and bursting with flavor.   Our favorite side item had to be the garlic broccoli. Perfectly steamed with real bits of garlic in and around. It went very well with the meal. The sauteed mushroom and onions were as hit as well.  Service here was lacking. Not sure if we had a new server or what, but forgot items, no refills, multiple visits to bring basics like salad dressing, etc.  Food here is worth returning. One of the better restaurants in the Concord Mills area."}
{"text":"When we first walk in the first thing that hit us was the place smell like they killed a dead cow and didn't clean it up. Second, it was dark and still smelly, third, no one came to ask for drinks after sitting for a while and it was still smelling, and fourth it was smelly!! The smell was so overwhelming we had to walk out. We would not been able to enjoy our dining experience. It's a shame but the place needs a good cleaning. I really wanted to give this place a try."}
{"text":"We ate at this location a year ago. It was so good, we wanted to visit again this year. Our experience on this visit was totally different. We walked in just after opening, and the booths needed a good cleaning. The table we were at was sticky, as were the menus, and crumbs were on our seats. Our meal was disappointing, but our server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Service was horrendous and on a Friday night the place was pretty vacant. Food just okay, dark and depressing on the inside."}
{"text":"Here for business and wanted to do a steakhouse! GREAT CHOICE!!!   Got the Smoked Sirloin and was blown away.  Probably was one of the best tasting meats I've ever had.  Wanted to go back but we didn't have time. So bummed.    I got a twice baked potato on the side and that was just as good. I recommend it if you like blue cheese. I also got the creamed corn and it was good as well.  Not very creamy but still do-able!   If you're around here I suggest you stop in! Yu can't go wrong...at least with their Smoked Sirloin!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are very good, but not anything special. Bbq shrimp taco with kimchi and the barbacoa and caramelized onions were good. Flour tortillas were ok. Decent."}
{"text":"After the NASCAR race on Sunday afternoon on October 11, 2015 we wanted a good steak after eating junk food for the last 3 days.  Since this place was down the road from the speedway it was ideal.   The ambiance when we walked in looked like we were going to get exactly what we wanted.   We ordered an appetizer of crispy onion strings,  which to say the least was good and the portion size for the price was good.  On to supper I ordered the txlc trio (which consists of 3 bacon and scallion wrapped shrimp,  bbq chicken and 6 oz of sirloin steak plus a side which was loaded mashed potatoes and a choice of soup or salad,  I opted for the smoked chicken tortilla soup), my fiance ordered the porterhouse (which was a 20oz steak with a side of loaded mashed potatoes  and he got the tortilla soup as well), my father got the filet mignon (which was a 6oz filet with mushrooms and he decided on 2 sides which were cream corn and 5 cheese Mac and cheese), my  step mother got the steak Oscar ( which was a 6 oz steak with a lump of crabmeat and bernaise sauce she got 2 sides as well which was spinach and garlic mashed potatoes).   Our soup was gross.  It was very very smoky flavoured the chicken in it was very chewy and the broth tasted like tomato with smoke in it.  Yuck   We got our supper.  It looked great my shrimp was to die for the chicken was great,  potatoes were awesome, but as I took the first piece of juicy steak made perfectly medium rare, it tasted disgusting. My fiance ( who is a chef in a big chain of upper class family restaurants back home in Canada called jack Astor's),  he thought it tasted odd like it was going bad but they grilled it up anyways. That was the first thing wrong.  My fiance cut in to his steak which he ordered rare it was more medium rare to medium then anything.   And my step mother who ordered her steak medium rare got hers rare.  So they got the steaks mixed up.   We sent his steak back to be done properly and she just ate hers as is.  I complained about my gross steak and asked for extra shrimp instead of another steak which was done.  Or waitress was great she was very helpful about everything,  she was just very low speaking.   So my fiances 2nd steak came out the waitress even said it looked too raw now so again it was sent back into the kitchen to cook more.  And now the manager was coming to our table because being a chef he wasn't too pleased. As the 3rd piece of steak came out the manager was there this time the steak was raw on the bone and medium rare for the rest of the steak.  She knew it wasn't right so she asked him if he wanted something else so he got a filet mignon rare.  4th time the manager came back out arms crossed looking quite pissed off standing there telling him to cut into the steak.  It was raw again so she again brought it back.  5th time the chef now came out with the steak just heated slightly.  So my fiance decided to give the chef a lesson in cooking and tell him how the temperature was supposed to be for a rare steak.  By the 6th time he finally got it right 3 hours later.  He started eating it took 2 bites and ended up throwing up  that continued a few more times that night.  So needless to say he didn't eat his food.    So I recommend not going to this restaurant for the steak you will either be sick or strongly disappointed."}
{"text":"My family decided to try your restaurant for the first time tonight and it will most definately be the last time.  Our party was 7 and a high chair and a sling, we were quoted a wait time of 25 minutes, but didn't get sat for an hour.  There were some parties before us, but nontheless, it shouldn't have taken that long.  Our server, louis, took good care of us, bring us waters before we started ordering. We put our order in and waited.  And waited. Louis brought some more bread and told us that the kitchen was a little backed up. We finally got our food about 30 minutes later.  My wife ordered the 6 ounce sirloin with broccoli, I had the full rack of baby back ribs with black beans and mac and cheese. I started with the macaroni,  which was lukewarm, along with the beans.  My wife hands me a piece of broccoli on her fork with something attached to it, a maggot.  Louis comes over along to see how everything was and I showed him what was on the fork, a manager walking by took the fork, screamed \"Oh my God!\" and left.  A couple minutes later a kitchen manager comes out to talk to us and to apologize.  He said that he was going to take care of the meal, and asked how my meal was.  I told him that Im not eating anything else from my meal, and he was going to take care of our whole parties food.  The front of house manager that ran off screaming never came back by to apologize or to check up on us.  She was even at the greeter stand when we were leaving and didn't say a word.  I know that my family and I will never be back because of one, there's bug and maggots served in the vegetables and two, the management doesn't know how to take care of guests. We didn't feel just because the meal was comped,  it was taken care of, but we left hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our meal. I had the 9oz Top Sirloin with the Cheesy Jalapeno Grits and the Balsamic Brussel Sprouts. I scraped the bowl of the grits they were so good. I liked the atmosphere (but as I say in most restaurants, turn down the music). Our waiter was attentive but wasn't in our faces ever 5 seconds. That is a real plus to me since we wanted to talk. Our food came at a reasonable pace and not one thing right on top of the other.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I try to find the positive in any restaurant, so I'll start with what I did like:  The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is very friendly.   Now, what I didn't like:  The wedge salad was topped with stale croutons, chewy bacon, and mealy tomatoes. When the salad was served, I was not offered fresh black pepper even though the pepper mill was 2 feet away from the bartender. The pork chops were thin, extremely salty, dry, and full of bone chips. The creamed spinach was watery, had big lumps of cream cheese, and was overpowered by nutmeg. I was never asked if the meal was satisfactory, if I needed anything, or if I wanted dessert. When I pushed away my entree that was only 1/3 eaten, the bartender presented the check and never thanked me for my business. The manager stood on the bar next to my plate so that he could get his football game on the television above my head.  Overall opinion:  This is redneck fine dining."}
{"text":"My first yelp review ever - downloaded the app just to review. While the food was all cooked well enough, the restaurant was disgusting! I'll preface the following comments by saying I'm not a germaphobe, not a picky person about dirt, etc - almost the opposite. Often times my husband will say \"aren't you going to wash your hands??\" when I hadn't thought about it.   Walking in there was a slight odor, but not terrible, just like dirty carpet. When we were seated in our booth and handed menus I immediately noticed that there was butter or grease on the back of my menu and the pages of my husband's stuck together from something sticky. The table also felt a bit sticky, but with those sealed wood tables that happens even when clean sometimes depending on what they use to clean. When I asked the waitress for a new menu she brought me one that wasn't much better, clearly they never get wiped down. The outside of my glass was sticky, perhaps from the drink spilling over when being filled, but that also should have been wiped down because my hands felt sticky the entire meal. The glass just looked dirty. I will say, with everything else the silverware was at least clean.  The booth we were in was next to a faux log wall and you could tell the log wall hadn't been dusted in months, if ever. The ledges between booths and under the murals and the lighting fixtures were also covered in dust. I'm sure if we were sat near the Knick knacks and rising gear those also would have been dusty. It was very apparent that cleanliness wasn't a priority in the dining area, which naturally raises concerns about the kitchen.  With the slightly higher prices, just OK food, and dirty/sticky/dusty dining area I'm not surprised that the larger Texas Roadhouse literally across the street had a 30 min wait while there were more empty than filled tables at the Texas Land & Cattle. Next time, and all future times, we'll take the wait."}
{"text":"When in Concord I often eat here and have yet to be disappointed. To be clear, there are better steak houses but in its segment it is top rung. Two different sized filet available, can top I them with something like 7 different toppings including Bernaise, blue cheese crumbs, etc. Salad selection good. They could use a good light beer added to their selection. So tired of Coors, Bud and Miller being the only lite beer choices when there are Amstel, Yuengling, Sam Adams and Heinekin lite options available that cost about the same. They're   not alone here.   Overall a very nice place that you can get a good steak and a couple glasses if wine for $40."}
{"text":"The good.  The food was excellent and the staff friendly. We all had steaks and though they were out of their signature ribeye, their other selections were available. I had a porterhouse cooked rare and it was excellent, meat quality was par for this type of restaurant. Those in my party had a boneless ribeye, a sirloin and a new york strip. Each was perfectly cooked and hot. We also all had grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes and they were really good as well. My brother had the blood orange margarita and it was perfectly balanced, i had blue moon and it was cold and frothy. Dessert was great!!!!  Now the bad We waited 5 minutes at the door and were not seated, or even greeted, when we were seated, our table was not clean and we waited and waited for our waitress. When she arrived she took our drink order and brought us bread promptly, however there was an extended wait for the alcoholic drinks. When my beer arrived, she had forgotten my orange wedge. She took our food orders but did not seem interested in asking about add ons or extras. She also did not bring the pitcher of water to the table that everyone seemed to have. She consistently neglected our drinks and when she did stop, she did not ask about refilling. Finally, though not very busy, the staff seemed slow. We went at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening and the crowd was light to medium."}
{"text":"Revising my previous review.  This place was banging around 2008 when I left my last review.  I continued to patronize the place up until 2010ish when the menu changed. At that time a lot of the regulars started to leave as did the wait staff, most of whom (surprising in this industry) had stuck around for several years.  I stopped recommending this place around 7 years ago, and I just couldn't let my glowing review hang around."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day. Extremely disappointed. Totally overpriced for poor food. Two adults got salmon and it was over seasoned with pepper. The asparagus seemed to be grilled but tasted raw, which we had to pay extra for as a side. The broccoli was totally over cooked. We asked for a replacement side and ended up with DRY garlic mashed potatoes. My sons cheese quesadilla was hard as a brick on the edges. Service was just ok. Wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money here...after we finished our meal my family decided that McDonald's would have been better."}
{"text":"Chose this spot over Texas Roadhouse (and Longhorn).  I regret I didn't get a burger at nearby Sonic.  Where do I start?  I found a seat at the bar, and as I indicated on the check, felt very neglected.  Granted, it appears the bartender had just settled down after being busy, however I sat at the seat for more than 5 minutes before she took my drink order (I was one of only 5-6 at the bar).  I pretty well went unnoticed until she said \"I'll be with you\" and then the 5 minute clock started.  Grabbed my own menu on the sticky bar and quickly selected the 12oz boneless Ribeye-one of my favorite steaks.  And there I sat.  5 minutes.  7 minutes.  9 minutes.  Waiting to be asked if I knew what I wanted.  I put the menu open in front of my.  Closed the menu in front of me.  Got on my phone and surfed Facebook with the menu in front of me.  Nothing.  Then, a person who appeared to be in a supervisory role turned to me and said (as I stared right at her)-\"Is there anything you need?\" to my reply, \"yes, I'd like to order\".  She turned to the bartender and let her know I was ready to order.  REALLY????  Once the bartender stopped figiting around on the cash register, she took my order.  It was 7:55pm.  At 8:00, she brought a huge loaf of warm bread.  No silverware.  So I sat there for 15 minutes before I finally was so hungry I tore at the bread and dipped it into the butter.  Was she around for me to ask for silverware?  Nope.    The second drink I ordered was not made correctly-lime instead of a lemon in my vodka soda.  I know it sounds petty, and that mistake is made 50% of the time, but I took the lime right out and put it on the napkin.  Finally, I asked a server who had gone back to make drinks for her customers for a lemon.    8:35pm-here comes my steak.  The 12oz ribeye looked just like the sirloin the guy next to me ordered, and was the thinest steak I've had since a steakburger at Steak and Shake.  Enough fat on it to take at least 4 of the 12oz.  The creamed corn had no cream, but was rather cooked frozen corn in butter.  Garlic Mashed potatoes were good--but no better than had I ordered them at Longhorn.  The best service came from a server who was working the bar for a moment, and who made my final drink (in a smaller glass than the two I had ordered).  I pointed it out and she went ahead and made the change.  She also indicated she wasn't working the bar, but I still told her it was the best service of the evening.  Maybe they were busy before and trying to recoup?  Ok maybe--but the lack of service and quality of food when it finally came out has no excuse.  I was a single diner at a bar where 3 of us were eating.    I am kicking myself now because on a $47 check, I tipped $5.  I should have tipped nothing, but must have calculated my math wrong.  $2 tip would have reflected the service better.  This TLC is NOT like its other restaurants in TX and around the country.  I expected the same quality and level of service, which at best was 1 star."}
{"text":"Liked the steak and loved the service...Knowing nothing about the area (driving by on the way to Atl) and haven't had steak for more than a month, we followed the suggestions of our hotel, due to our stay at, we also received a free appetizer there.   We really did not need the appetizer as all steaks seemed to be a lot of food, but we got it anyway and instead we shared a 20 ounce porterhouse and two sides: broccoli and a Cesar salad. Well, all that was a ton of food and in terms of price great: for that plus two drinks we paid $40 (it would've been $49 if it weren't for the free app)...I don't think that is bad considering the huge quantity...  But the quality was also very good, especially that of the steak which was perfectly grilled and seasoned,,,The broccoli was...broccoli (can any body screw this up?) and the salad was average and forgettable. I personally did not go gaga over the appetizer, shrimp and avocado cocktail...it was pretty much a martini glass filled with spice salsa with several large chinks of avocado and some shrimp served with tortilla chips... Others might like this version of a shrimp cocktail but I didn't like diving into the salsa in order to find the shrimp, especially since the salsa was spicy for my taste (but again, others might like spicy).   Our server was fantastic: very attentive, friendly, and smiley!  I'd definitely go again!  (BTW it was a Sat night and a 25' wait, so we sat in the bar area -immediately...In addition to the bar stools there are also a few booths in that area, so check it out if you don't want to wait and you are a small group)"}
{"text":"We pulled in @ 9pm with a parking lot that was empty sign said 10. At first it seemed like we where an inconvenience to them even though there was an hour before close. Or waitress didn't have much of a personality and made us feel a little rushed. Or food was very good over all. I would highly recommend the Cajan ribeye along with the twice baked blue cheese potato. The waiter who was not serving us was much more entertaining for our children than our own waitress was. Other than that was an over all good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the Queso as appetizer.  It was only $6.99, but the Queso is a really small dish not even a cup and it was cold.  Also, the chips were crumbs from the bottom of a chip bag.  Steaks and entrees were grossly overpriced.  Who is going to pay $33 for a ribeye at a $$ restaurant.  At beginning of meal, the server very awkwardly asked if wanted bread.  The two round bagel like bread pieces were served cold instead of warm.  Server forgot to give us straws until we requested them. We each ordered a burger.  The brisket burger had about a tablespoon of brisket on it.  The steakburger patty was way smaller than the bun.  Our broccoli and cheese baked potato substitutions for 99 cents each were the best part of the meal but by far not big enough to be an entree.  The potato could have been improved if the broccoli and cheese were at a higher temperature.  The service was sketchy at best and instead of refilling our drinks as we ate, she would come to the table and say \"is there anything else you need?\" which was awkward.  She should've refilled our drinks without asking.  So a cold Queso with crumbs for chips and 2 burgers later, the total was $47.79, an astronomical price for what we ate.  I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and each time has been disappointing.  The first visit a few months ago was lackluster at best.  All four of the guests in our party had undercooked food.  My hamburger was pretty raw in the center even though I ordered medium.  We had our food sent back.  Yesterday I went again and we got two rolls for six people.  The chicken on my nachos was cold.  I don't think the prices at this restaurant can be justified.  On a positive note, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good steack joint!  Usually if the service is just so-so, then no matter how good the food is I just don't like the joint.  This time, however the steak was the star attraction and more than made up for the mediocre service!  Don't get me wrong, the staff were quite friendly, just not very attentive & we had to repeat requests; our waiter didn't even mention any specials or make suggestions.  If you want a fantabulous steak then head here....very much worth it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during race weeks and I really wasn't impressed. I got a steak and my co-horts had chicken. Everyone's food was ok, but no one was really wowed and it was pretty pricey. Next time we'll try Tx Roadhouse across the street and hope thats better."}
{"text":"It seems like we were not alone in our wait. (Read other reviews) there were very few people in the restaurant which should have been a sign. We waited for about 45 minutes from the time we sat down till the time we got our food. There are very few people around to help or talk to about the slow service.   There was a table that got sat down and left because no one came and spoke with them.  The food was decent once it came but some items were lacking."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try and was very impressed. The burgers are fantastic excellent appetizers and the service was really very good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today for lunch. Food was great, and more than enough. Next time, my husband and I will share because we each brought home enough for dinner. I got the fried chicken steak with mashed potatoes, and hubby got fried sirloin. We will definitely hope back. The server was super friendly just a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"Every once in a while we venture to Texas Land and Cattle. Yes it's a chain, and not particularly authentic, but they crank out a good burger and a solid steak. We've never had a problem with the service and it's always been prompt.  Unfortunately this is becoming the kind of place where kids are parked at tables in front of tablets, which I find extremely rude and distracting to other patrons, but this is somewhat expected given the proximity to the mall.   Overall I'd say if your in a pinch, Texas Land & Cattle is a safe bet for a good burger or sandwich."}
{"text":"Worse food ever! Steak was burger meat.  Chicken SW soup was watery.   Sampler platter was super salty and you can taste the oil in the chips.  Yuck!  Never again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere  is nice.  The smoked meats were good and the sides were lack luster.  Th beef soup was over salted along with the broccoli and mashed potatoes.  The brisket tacos were good if love salt.  The service was great.  The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I won't be back.  The food was horrible. I had the Texas brisket sandwich with a soupy Cesar salad.  The brisket was cold and flavorless and the salad had limp lettuce with to much dressing.  When no one else is in the restaurant that is your clue"}
{"text":"I definitely needed to wait to write this review until I was well removed from the dining experience. It was beyond horrible. Horrible service, raw food, uncaring management, and just an all around bad experience. There were 11 of us dining, including 7 kids. Our kids are very well behaved in restaurants and they were great the whole time.  We arrived at 6:00 pm a Sunday night, the restaurant was a little busy but not too full. They said 30 minute wait. 45 minutes later we were seated. We had taken the 45 minutes to look over menu and were ready to order when the waitress first greeted us. This was at approximately 6:55 we placed our order, food and drinks. Around 7:15 our drinks came minus the wine. Around 7:55 the salads and wine came (note, this is an hour after we sat down). We threw some croutons at the kids, asked for bread and were told they ran out. They didn't offer us anything else. I'm thinking, damn, I should not have ordered my salad minus the croutons at this point. At 8:10 the waitress offered the kids some croutons. Said the food should be around shortly.  Our food finally came at around 835, this was 1 hour 40 minutes after we sat down. We were annoyed but everyone had food so no big deal, right? WRONG, they decided that serving the kids RAW burgers after waiting 2 + hours  (between wait for table and wait for food would be a good idea. 6 kids ordered burgers so 6 RAW burgers were served. We had to send them all back thinking really they will rush this at this point right? WRONG again, nope, we all ate, I gave my kids my steak (the steak was actually pretty good. We were done eating and ready to leave when the burgers come back out. We left without them, we had given the kids our food and all got a little mac and cheese from the one kid that didn't order a burger and some fries. We all left hungry and so disappointed. The manager tried to make excuses. The server didn't even put our food order in until 7:42, almost an hour after we sat down.  People all around us had been seated, ordered, ate their food, and were done while we waited.  It was beyond horrible. Attaching pictures of the raw burgers (unedited) that my kids were served."}
{"text":"My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were good. The service wasn't perfect but not bad.  I would give 4 stars if the price was just a little lower.  Very similar to longhorn steakhouse."}
{"text":"I came here recently and the only thing good was the service other than that I wasn't pleased at all my chicken was very dry and bland"}
{"text":"Whole place smells bad, like a bar bathroom. The carpet is disgusting, please replace it. I didn't even want to risk using the restroom. Service was super slow. Ordered my steak medium-well, got medium rare. Two other orders at our table were wrong. We've eaten at a TL&C before and had an excellent experience, but this? This was awful. We saw several people walking out as we were walking in, and we should have followed suit."}
{"text":"Texas Land & Cattle is a steakhouse chain from...you guessed it, Texas. There are 18 or so locations across TX and 1 each in 3 or 4 other states out west, the one in Concord is the only one east of the Mississippi. Word on the street is the only reason it's here in Concord is because Charlotte Speedway owner Bruton Smith has one by his Texas Motor Speedway and likes it so much he wanted a TL&C by his Charlotte speedway, so here ya go.   As you would imagine, its got a Texas ranch style theme to it, they have a bar area with seating and a flat screen tv or 2 besides the regular dining area of booths and tables & chairs. The hostess takes your name when you enter and calls you when your table is ready, our wait was maybe 15 minutes on our visit.   I went with their signature \"Smoked Sirloin\" and Mesquite Grilled Shrimp, both were perfect. The Smoked Sirloin had a great smoke flavor to it with a peppercorn type crust on it cooked medium rare, it comes already sliced in thin slivers which I thought was great. Very juicy and tender, definitely doesn't need any kind of sauce, that would just ruin the great flavor the steak has on its own. That Smoked Sirloin was definitely one of the best steaks I've had from a restaurant.   The menu has alot of great sounding items, I'll definitely return at some point to try more of what the Texas Land & Cattle has to offer."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area for lunch today with a group from work. Service was great, friendly and attentive. We had a dip appetizer which had queso, guac, and a spinach dip which was tasty. Each of us had salads and they were huge. I had the cobb salad with steak and there was plenty!"}
{"text":"We had a large group, so it's somewhat understandable that the service left a lot to be desired, but we were stuck with two brand new guys who were slow and inattentive. As for the food, it was pretty underwhelming. I ordered a Sirloin medium rare that came out cold, the baked potato was cold, and the salad didn't have much to it other than lettuce. Charlotte has tons of places for steak, so skip this one if you can."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I am wondering if I am at the same Texas Land & Cattle restaurant.  For starters, the place was empty, so it could be possible that this is the same place, but after we were promptly greeted, seated and introduced by our server Kristen, I am sure that the reviews have been outdated and are not relevant to its current rating based on my experience.  Our server, Kristen, was by far the best waitress / server that we have had in a very long time.  She was very prompt in greeting us, and took our drink order.  Of course,  we stick with the sweet tea and water, as tea is very important to my wife, and since I am a little chintzy, I always request water.....this is a 10 year habit that is very hard to break.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have carafes of tea and water that is left on the table. Some may see this as a form of being lazy, but I see this as the single best simple idea to provide the absolute best in customer service.  After all, what is your biggest complaint usually......exactly, not having your drinks refilled,  thus, they have solved this problem.  Our tea was fresh, and since it was so fresh, Kristen actually brought an additional ice cup, to help enjoy the drink as it was still warm.  There is something to be said about fresh tea in the south. This was excellent sweet tea.  The bread was very soft and warm, and unlike the other chains whose crust is almost too hard, this was just a perfect way to start our meal.  Now, when we placed our order, Kristen listened and repeated the order afterwards, and unlike other places she did not write anything down.  She listened to the order, repeated the order, and then we acknowledged that she had the order correct, no mistakes!  My salad came out in a very nice chilled salad plate, just the way I like it, no tomatoes, no eggs, no onions. Add extra cheese, no dressing.  The croutons were plentiful, the cheese was perfect, and the lettuce was fresh, no dark spots, no hard core center or white pieces.  This was one of the best house salads I have had in a while.  Now for the meals. My wife had the Signature Sirloin Dip Sandwich, which comes with shoestring fries, a pickle and the au jus dip. She requested an extra pickle, and it arrived as ordered.    I had the *NEW* Mesquite Grilled Quail, which comes with the house salad and garlic mashed potatoes, and this was much better than expected.  It is not that often that you can have such a meal at a nice location, especially a chain restaurant of this type.  As usual, I have added photos of our meals, as this is only fair to show the quality of the items we received regardless of the taste, but this will help solidify my reviews.  The location was not busy, but people were constantly being seated and the tables were being turned very quickly.  We were not rushed, we were tended to, and the food came out in a timely manner.  The food was fantastic, the quail had a hint of mesquite smoked flavor, the mashed potatoes were awesome, hot, garlicky, and fresh.  The Sirloin Dip was excellent, the bread was toasted, the fries were shoestrings which we do not have often and the au jus was great for the dipping.  We did not have room for desert, but let me say this in my yelping voice......C'Mon people give these guys a chance....This was one of my better dining experiences, and that says a lot!  I am stingy with my stars, but this is a solid 4, give it a half, but I have rounded down, due to my education in the CMS system.  Thanks Kristen, for reviving my hope in the service industry.

{"text":"I wish there was a 2.5 I could mark.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  It was just okay.  The food was decent and so was the service, but nothing to get excited about.  However there were a couple things that just made me scratch my head:  I got a bowl of soup and it was brought to me with a plastic spoon.  No explanation was given as to why.  Soup was a little tough to enjoy with the smaller than average plastic spoon.  Secondly, I received two refills on my beverage.  Even though she brought my original drink with ice in it, both refills had no ice at all.  When I looked around the restaurant I saw other glasses with ice, so I am not sure why... Again, no explanation. As I said before, the food and service were adequate, but when I go out to eat I am really looking for good to great.  This was simply okay."}
{"text":"Sorry.  Not impressed.  I've had better meals at Long Horn and Outback....& those bars are not that high."}
{"text":"I ordered togo. My burger was cooked perfectly. The waitress forgot a few things on my order incorrect, but corrected it with an apology. I would return."}
{"text":"I came here recently and the only thing good was the service other than that I wasn't pleased at all my steak wasn't good quality. The place wasn't member at all"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place, especially after reading some of the previous reviews. Yes, the service was slow.  It was race weekend and we expected this, but it gave us enough time to look over the menu, enjoy each other's company, and get caught up in Facebook."}
{"text":"This used to be my all time favorite restaurant. We've moved further away and hadn't visited in about two years until tonight. I was surprised to see it so dead on a Friday night, each server only had one table seated in their section. I'm not sure is management has changed, but the entire place has gone down hill. The menus were tattered and taped together, the menu selection is cut in half, and the facility is extremely dirty. The upholstery on every booth and the carpets were extremely stained, it looks like sofa soills. Nothing looks clean. They removed the porterhouse from the menu (What steakhouse doesn't sell a porterhouse?) and my filet was terribly cut and seasoned. Disappointing, definitely not the TXLC I used to love and look forward to."}
{"text":"We arrived and waited 20 minutes for a table, so we ordered drinks at the bar. Good thing, because once we were seated that was all we had to drink. We ordered our appetizer and meal at the same time. Eventually the appetizer showed up. Thirty minutes later our salads and entrees arrived. Service was super slow, we would have appreciated the opportunity to get more drinks. Food was ok, but I have had better. We will not return."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I actually get to one of these steakhouse type places.  In fact, I try and avoid them.  I will say that if I have to choose on looks alone, Texas Land and Cattle would likely win.  They are pretty nice looking places.  No peanuts on the floor here.  Or at least not if you're the first in the door - maybe later in the night the nuts pile up, but I'm thinking not.  This is definitely a higher-class place than your Lone Star or Longhorn, at least on looks.  Unfortunately they seem to have spent so much time getting ready for the dance that they forgot to learn how.  It's not that they are bad or anything, it's just that they aren't that good.  Now as I mentioned, I don't normally go for this sort of place, but when my parents come to town, they like a steak, and there aren't that many options, and they aren't as adventurous as I am, so when they see the shiny new place just off the highway, guess where they will pick?  For that, it's not a bad choice.  But if you want somewhere else, you are probably better served if you keep digging a bit."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, each time hopeful that the poor service was just a one time thing. After the last time of sitting at our table for almost ten minutes with no acknowledgement of service we left and choose not to return.  I gave two stars because the food is not horrible. It is your average corporate chain meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a very limited menu. They did not even have a drink menu because it was \"under construction\". The roadhouse steak I had was just hamburger meat formed into a big patty. The chicken bean soup had neither chicken or beans in it. Absolutely terrible restaurant. I even overheard the employees talking about then putting in their two weeks! Absolutely unbelievably terrible. Please don't go here."}
{"text":"Traveling through Concord late last Wednesday evening I really needed a good hearty meal. To say the least I was extremely disappointed with Texas Land and Cattle. The Ribs were just ok, and the price was way too high. Even though I have my expenses paid, and this meal was free to me, over $28 with no achohoI consumed for one person too much.   The service was adequate with most servers appearing to be college age or slightly older. Tough way to work through college so I can't give them too hard a time. The waiter was kind enough to get me a sample of the steak he recommended and it's a good thing he did because the meat was way overseasoned and left a bad peppery taste in your mouth.  I don't want to be the male version of Debbie Downer, but this place is just not worth the money."}
{"text":"To avoid the crowd we came here with the kids Thanksgiving evening. Staff greeted us very kindly and took care of us in a very professional manner and the food was not any less to rave about. Between the four of us we tried all different kinds of meals, ribs, ribeye, filet, salads and all of them were excellent, even the sweet tea was great. Everything fresh and flavorful. We are pretty particular about our food and this is a place we will come back to."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Texas Land & Cattle since it opened in Concord had experienced one night where the service wasn't what we had grown to expect.  Our visit last week went very well with my wife ordering a fish dinner and I had the Signature Smoked Sirloin (12oz.)  The smoked sirloin was excellent, but might not be for everyone.  The chief had me taste a sample piece just to make sure beforehand and I was glad I ordered the 12 oz.  Waitress was very helpful and courteous throughout."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab a bite to eat. On two occasions the steak was purple in the middle not only did the manager come and comp my meal but replaced it with a free steak which was filet for free and gave me free drinks. I understand when your busy that you try to fly out food as fast as possible and the only problem with that is make sure that the meat is cooked. The manager made up for everything though and the food if prepared correctly is great"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Too many people standing around socializing and not servicing. Meal was decent but the appetizer was terrible and after one bite, we left it untouched but were never asked why. Bland food and watered down drinks.  I'll even complete their online survey to help them get a clue but wouldn't return for the freebie for doing so."}
{"text":"It is not often someone knows how to cook chicken and it juicy and not dry. Plain chicken with no topping or sauce. This place does it right. I expect wait at a steak place. It goes with the territory. Love this place."}
{"text":"I would have given them 2 stars but no half-sies on Yelp. VERY average food. Very pleasant restaurant. We were a table of 11 with five elementary school ages kids and Sarah the waitress was great. No question, the service rocked. The food, not so much."}
{"text":"We will never go back again, service terrible and the food was just ok,,, it was a dirty place. Service was horrible - nothing to drink while our appetizer came, we had no silverware or napkin to use until after twenty min. I asked a hostess for utensils. I do think our server was over worked so I did tip well. I observed many employees talking and joking around and our server and another guy looked like they were trying to do all the work. We got one refill for tea the entire time - we were there almost two hours just to eat dinner. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My husband I come to this location at least 4-6 times a year.  Their signature smoked sirloin and house dressing are so delicious! The staff is always accommodating and the meals are pretty large and affordable."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit I'd never choose a steakhouse, but while in Charlotte on NASCAR business, this was the chosen place.  I am not a huge steak eater do I teetered between the seafood options. All sounded amazing, but I went with the salmon. It had a delicious smokey flavor, however it was slightly overcooked and not as flakey as I like. The bread was warm, crusty and very good.   I ordered an IPA (huge beer snob) and was delivered some type of wheat. I didn't have the heart to send it back because the service was superb. All three servers helping us were sweet and attentive.   Everyone in our party of 18 seemed to enjoy the food and most plates were clean.    While this is not at all my jam, it was a nice dinner with the team."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life. The service was slow and every member of the staff seemed more incompetent than the last. Our poor waitress was obviously doing her best but there was an obvious lack of training. The dim witted bartender even put ice in my beer. That's when it crossed the line from merely bad to spectacularly disappointing."}
{"text":"We were searching for a steakhouse for my boyfriend's birthday, and after seeing how long the wait was at Texas Roadhouse, we decided to give this place a shot.  We were NOT disappointed.  They bring you out soft, round rolls with whipped butter.  They were hot, fresh, and delicious.  We got the crab cakes appetizer, and although we thought they would be bigger judging by the menu picture, they were still amazing.  The aioli sauce they were served with was a great complement.  I was pretty impressed that you have a choice of 3 side salads- house, Caesar, or wedge.  The wedge did not disappoint.  It was loaded with blue cheese & bacon.  My boyfriend got the Caesar, and also loved it.  For our entrees, I got the Ribeye encrusted in peppercorn, and topped with creamy sauce.  It was full of flavor.  He got the top sirloin and also loved it.  We were impressed that our steaks were cooked to the perfect temp.   Our server, Shawn, was very attentive.  We never had an empty drink.  Overall, a great experience.  $60 for 2 (no alcohol) is pretty great for a steakhouse. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday.    Not crowded but service was horribly slow.   Ordered Cajon burger.   It was very undercooked.    Doubt I will patronize again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I think that some of the bad reviews were a mistake on the reviewer's posting to the incorrect restaurant. There are two restaurants in the area that start with Texas. I don't think this one even has soup.   Our experience was great. Good service, good food, good atmosphere. All in all, everything tasted great! No complaints.  My nine year old insisted we set the record straight with a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Musky smell ! Soon as we walked in !!! Carpet needs replacing bad !! Hostess walked to our table and laid the menus down and walked away never acknowledged us or said our servers name or would see us soon! Waitress was real nice and had good eye contact and was pleasantly nice and made some good suggestions  I had the so called smoked steak !!! Which was prime rib slow smoked and sliced in a good amount !but was cold even after they made another order which would have been better going back to the grill for 5 mins asparagus wasn't cooked to perfection and made it perfect the second time with a new so called smoked steak again which was in same order  Had them just not worry about but waitress insisted I try the sirloin cooked my way medium rare , which I. Fact came back well done needlessly to say I would rather them Not charge me for my half of the meal!!! But instead try something I didn't want so I doubt I will be going back again ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and appetizer. After someone helped us the drink I order was wrong. Definitely was not Kettle One that I ordered. Told manager and they blew it off and did not offer anything else."}
{"text":"Garbage food - even by chain restaurant standards.  Check was incorrect, food was cold and the whole place needs a good cleaning.   My sandwich had obviously fallen off the plate and was hastily reassembled between kitchen and table.  Fries are Ore Ida at best.  Crab cakes were fishy, small and lukewarm.  Too many other choices to bother with Texas Land and Cattle."}
{"text":"Smoked Sirloin! Hands down the best smoked meat I have ever eaten.  The portions were huge and the price very good.  Service was quick and friendly.  If you can get by here make sure you stop.  It will be well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Ordered the large sampler platter and got a tray with mostly tortilla chips, a small bowl of spinach artichoke dip, 2 small chicken tenders, 4 small jalapeno pipes and 2 small portions of (total 8 very thin) ribs that were too tough to chew and were left unbeaten for $35! boo. Then, we waited forever for our food, only for it to be so awful, as hungry as we were, none of us could eat much of it. Awful experience."}
{"text":"The place is practically empty and we've waited 20 min for food.  Then it arrives and the meat looks like it spent 2 min on the grill. Steak salad but they forgot the dressing. There is no genuine effort to put out a good plate. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Was with the wife at the mall and we decided we were in the mood for a steak lunch.  We had the ribeye and the brisket sandwich. Both were ok.   The first inpression is not very good either. As you walk in, the first thing you notice is a smell, characteristic of old places. Musky, with a tad of humidity.  Overall, an ok place. Nothing great. Definetively better options out there."}
{"text":"First time here. Wonderful service and food !  We sat in the bar area and the bartender was fantastic and running her tail off!  She was nice, super service and happy. Very refreshing !  My steak did come out over cooked but the manager had them cook another one immediately and it was melt in my mouth perfect!  Highly recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Sept 11:  Wanted a steak for dinner. This place came up with some good reviews. Was hesitant because of another review two days ago about a really bad smell. So when we get there, we are seated right by the door. It's 5:30 and the place is NOT busy. With two families we ask for a table in the back. So the host brings us back to a booth. Not a table, so whatever. We get seated and the host comes back later with straws and says or waiter will be with us shortly. Six min later the waiter comes and gets our drinks. He comes back a couple min later with bread and the two beers. No water for the other four. Finally get our order of appetizer and meals. Salads come quick. Appetizers finally show with our meals. I ordered the top sirloin done medium. My plate came out with a medium well. Should have ordered it med rare. Other couple ordered the house steak which was really good. Good smokey flavor. At the end our bill was wrong and mixed up between the two tickets so we had to wait a while for our waiter to correct it. All in all it was an ok place."}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting the Great Wolf Lodge! The smoked sirloin was recommended and was a WINNER. Kid friendly, great experience in the Concord area!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak houses. I prefer my steak cooked on the rare side and they nailed it perfectly. Our entire meal was perfect. Our waiter was polite and courteous. He was attentive to our dining needs. I would recommend eating here. Prices aren't as bad as I have read in other reviews. They are very reasonable for the dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was average, beer on tap was warm, service, while friendly, was ridiculously slow for 3:30 on a Friday with 2 other tables occupied.  Highlight was the fried pickle appetizer...perfectly fried with great dipping sauce.  Lowlight, other than snail service, was the steak nachos, which was actually like 10 chips topped with a little cheese & a cube of steak.  Burgers were average & fries were not hot.  Ludicrous 30% tip added to bill!  If I'm going to waste 2 hours of my life and $200 (party of 5), I better be wowed...and I wasn't."}
{"text":"We recently held a large dinner for clients at this restaurant. The service was pretty good considering how large of a group it was. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was nice and casual. I was surprised to find that the women's bathroom did not have any toilet seat covers. If I am in town again and need to host a dinner I will definitely be considering this place."}
{"text":"Just ok. I came here to Charlotte for work and nearby was this steakhouse. I would say the inside is nice, has a typical steak chain ambiance like Outback or Longhorns.  I had the Shrimp & Grits with a side of asparagus. I wasn't into ordering the steak but the group I went with ordered it and liked it. If you're a vegetarian, there are some salads or veggie options too. Limited but available.   if you're staying here I would say worth a try since it is better than TGIF or Jack and the Box. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I got the 9oz top sirloin steak with a side salad & fresh green beans. The flavor on the steak was excellent & the meat was tender. My mom got the same thing & said it was good. Mt dad got the salmon & said it was some of the best he's ever had. Service was fast & the chef even came out to check the meal was prepared correctly. Over all I'm impressed.  It's not like the typical chain steak restaurant."}
