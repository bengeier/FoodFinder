{"text":"To start, this catering company has great BBQ! I've heard about this company from a friend of mine and decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised and will be ordring from this catering company in the future. The brisket was very tender, with the fat at the top adding a really nice texture to the meat. The baked beans were great of course and I would order the mac n cheese again. Can't wait to try the pulled pork BBQ with their Texas and Carolina sauces next.

PS. Even though there's an address listed for this place, this is a catering company and the owner may have a different location for pick-up than what's listed."}
{"text":"I just ordered from them today. This wasn't my first time eating there food but it was probably my last.I order the same thing every time I go to this food truck and I usually always get what I want or need, when the regular people that I am use to are working there. Today I ordered the Chicken nachos I asked them to add extra BBQ Salsa which they did but when i put an emphasis on PLEASE NO BLACK BEANS I end up getting exactly wheat I stressed I didn't want and I find pork in my nachos when I specifically only ever eat chicken I had to pick thought ALL of the black beans that shouldn't have been on there and I had to pick through the PORK that I can't eat. I won't be going here again just because it shouldn't have been that difficult to just put in what I ordered correctly."}
{"text":"I didn't know it was really possible to cut cooked meat with a fork until I had sliced brisket from T2C's food truck. That's right, the best brisket I've ever had came from a truck! Mind. Blown. Add their homemade Carolina sauce (it's vinegar based) to it and O M G! I had mine with sides of mac&cheese and baked beans--both homemade. SO good, y'all! They cater, too!"}
