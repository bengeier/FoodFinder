{"text":"Neighbor stopped by and asked me if i wanted a gyro from this new place down the street, said sure. I am a loyal Salim's on Centre Ave. But gave it a try. All I have to say was.. delish. The cucumber dressing was different, not a cool taste, but a more of a zing. Wasn't overrun by the lettuce, but the actual meat. Havent personally been in there, but will be going to see whwt other surprises they have."}
{"text":"I live two blocks from here and just ate here for the first time yesterday. The owner was so nice and made the most delicious falafel sandwich for for me. Very vegan friendly too!! Everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients. I'll definitely be frequenting the spot more often! Support this small, locally owned spot!"}
{"text":"This little diner is definitely a hidden gem. It looks a tad cheesy on the outside, but the food is amazing. The owner is really friendly and would gladly tell you about how he got started in the food business if you ask. The diner offers brunch, sandwiches, burgers, pizza and salads. Everything is super cheap and under $10. Portions are great and definitely worth it. The food took a while to come out though since it was a one man show.  My favorite sandwich on the menu is the Cajun chicken sandwich. It has a kick to it and the Cajun mayo adds that silky smooth touch. I also had the chance to try the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the beef fajita Panini, which are both amazing as well. The sandwiches all came with a side of crispy seasoned fries. The best part about this diner is that everything is freshly made by the owner himself. Even the greens on the sandwich come from his garden. You can't get more fresh than that.   Overall, my dinning experience at New Way Gourmet was wonderful. The food was yummy, service was friendly, setting was clean and the prices were affordable. My next target on the menu will be the burgers and pizza, which I'm confident will be equally delicious."}
{"text":"All of the food here is delicious and very fairly priced. Yum! Yum! Yum! My faves have been a special philly cheese steak wrap and the gyro. The fries are not amazing but are good enough. The soups are wonderful."}
{"text":"I can't sing new way's praises enough. I live a hop, skip and a jump away from this gem and checked it out for the first time after some Arsenal workers recommended it on a night they didn't have a food truck. The owner is super friendly, makes everything from scratch and gives you substantial portions at an extremely low price. The place is never too crowded so he is always able to whip up your delicious meal in no time whilst you window gaze at the busy strip of Penn Avenue outside. The tuscan chicken sandwich was awesome as well as the hot italian sausage sandwich when it is on special. You really can't go wrong with anything you get there, though. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I stopped in again today and had their Big Kahuna Burger which is topped with cheese, avocado butter, a pineapple glaze and fried onions. They describe it as being \"famous.\" Well, I'd never heard of it, but it was pretty sweet burger, in flavor and as in, er...cool.   Y'know, \"dat burger wuz sweet,\" like the kids say. Or do they still say that? Anyway, I may go there again tomorrow or Friday. Like a good album, this place beckons repeated visits.   Oh, the burger came with sweet potato fries too, which were chunky,  Thanksgiving- plunged-in-hot fat gooood.   Also, it bears mentioning that their food is not only good but DIRT CHEAP!  My burger, fries, and a nice chunk of their Black Forest Chocolate Cake cost me less than 8 bucks.     These are the kinds of eateries I like to see in our city neighborhoods; places that defy gentrification and offer tasty and reasonable food for regular people on a budget."}
{"text":"I have passed this place lots of time but never gave it much thought until I read the reviews. So I went today expecting something great and was not disappointed! I got the gyro meal and a slice (more like a slug) of the chocolate cake and everything was delicious! The gyro had plenty of meat and the tzatziki  sauce was really nice with the veggies. The prices were almost as much of a treat as the cake! It may be the oncoming food coma but I am sure my bill was only a little more than 8 bucks. You can't really get tasty real food and be full on 8 bucks at too many places. Go now!"}
{"text":"New Way Deli is a chill spot to go to. When you want some quality food that is not fast food, but not fancy shmancy sit down food, New Way Deli is a place to consider. The owner, Sam, is a good dude that makes good food. It generally takes a while to make because he makes it on the spot in front of you, but when it's ready you won't be disappointed. I would recommend the gyro (pronounced jee-rohs according to a sign in the store) because that is what the place is known for.   I used to never go here because their hours were 9-5 Monday through Friday, which coincided with my work hours, but they just changed to stay open until 7 most weekdays. As far as a sandwich goes, Grateful Deli does not hold a candle to this place. Butler Street Deli is good but doesn't have as flexible hours and New Way Deli has more options for their menu.   Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Seriously, these sweet potato fries. It seems the trend on Penn doesn't stop at Spak. I stopped in randomly and had a great chat with the owner to the tune of the Phantom of the Opera soundtrack (courtesy of a radio station he once found accidentally and has since tuned his car, home, and work stations to).  I saw sweet potato fries advertised as a sidekick to the day's special, and decided to take the plunge. So satisfied! As I carried them over to where my cohorts were standing outside, across the street, everyone perked up and demanded to know where the incredible smell was emanating from. The taste, I can assure you, lived up to the olfactory hype, and the spicy ketchup (although not the best spicy ketchup I've ever experienced) was a nice addition to break up the practically never-ending stream of potato. (Trying to convey to you that the serving size = ginormous) I hope this incredibly limited review helps convince you to barge in there and order everything on the menu, immediately."}
