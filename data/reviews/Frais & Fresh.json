{"text":"When I first entered the store, I did not have high hope. Compared to Mandy's the decoration was a bit plain. I ordered beetroot and couscous salad and it turned out to be surprisingly good. Tempeh was perfectly seasoned and the dressing is flavourful too. The price is more friendly than Mandy's as well."}
{"text":"We simply loved the place and the food. The owner/manager is very generous and the salad plate is impresivly large."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick takeout lunch while I was in the area. I usually pick up salads at Mandy's but decided to check out Frais & Fresh because I was close and I heard the prices were so reasonable.

It turned out to be true! My salad was only $9 and it was the perfect size for lunch. While the ingredients may not be as creative as Mandy's, they really are fresh and delicious. I especially loved the use of grapefruit. I've never thought to add grapefruit to a savoury salad but it added a nice kick to the dish.

I will definitely be back!"}
