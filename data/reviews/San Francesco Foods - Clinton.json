{"text":"I have seen the reviews for this place and I'm must have missed something? We had the veal and pulled pork sandwich and a pizza slice. Both terrible! And the pizza was just ok. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich in the Little Italy neighborhood.  There are new owners there, but the food is just as great as it was before.  This sandwich is my father in law's reason for coming to visit us.   $6 bucks and you are stuffed!"}
{"text":"They advertise being a pizza place however rarely seem to have pizza anymore and when they do it is only pepperoni. They used to offer cheese & veggie slices as well which was great since Bitondos across the street only sells pepperoni slices.

I like to support local places instead of going up to college to get a pizza slice from large chains so it's a shame they have gone the route of Bitondos and aren't offering any pizza options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"End of an era.
My beloved San Francesco has changed hands and in spite of me giving the new management 3 chances to ensure the food is the same old school Italian style as before, I've realized the old San Fran is gone forever.
My goto 3 topping Party Size Pizza has gone from $16 to $22.  Not a big deal, as $16 was way too cheap, but they have cut the amount of toppings dramatically.  I was wondering why they only cut it into 12 slices instead of 24 like they used to, until I realized if you cut it into 24 slices, 1/2 the slices would have no toppings at all!
The sauce (the core of the San Fran pizza) is not the same.  The whole pizza is just a bland, toppingless  piece of dough.  Sauce on the veal is also  not quite the same.   They now have \"Dipping Sauces\" on the menu!!! Sad..sad..sad.  You may as well start having 2-4-1 specials. 

The tables are a welcome change though.  And the olives are just as good as ever.

I am now forced to do what was unthinkable for the last 20 years...Try out Bitondos to replicate the old school Italian taste and vibe.

Hopefully all the Bitondo aficionados I trash talked over the years won't see me there!!!"}
{"text":"Three words: hot veal sangwich. Sauce, hot peppers and nothing else. I've tried them all, and San Fran has the best around.

Pre-cooked meat and hot tables make an inferior sandwich. Pickled or oil-preserved hot peppers are just wrong. And a sandwich has to be the right size - big enough to satisfy, but not bigger than your head. This rules out Mustachio, California and all the others.

San Fran's lightly-breaded veal is fried to order, topped with a delicate tomato sauce and roasted hot peppers, and not so big that you're stuffing yourself at the end.  Simple and perfect.

Dec. 1/ 12 Update: I visited for the first time in a few weeks. San Fran is under new management, and they redecorated, adding more counter space for diners. The sandwich was as good as ever, though."}

{"text":"Just picked up some sandwiches here but just had to leave a review even though I usually don't do this but I experienced very bad customer service! The young female cashier with the many piercings on her ear was extremely rude for no reason. We are always nice people and I work in customer service and love dealing with people but the way this employee talked to us, I will not want to come back again. She talked to us like we are dumb when asking about the sandwich and prices of the toppings. I have never experienced customer service this bad and it was throughout the whole interaction. The sandwiches were delicious though!  Too bad they have her on cash.."}
{"text":"The veal parm sandwich is great! Would for sure come back. Have heard it was good so I had to see for myself. I definitely did not disappoint. Staff appeared to be all family, which made you feel at home. I love small hole in the wall places."}
{"text":"Hygiene is zero.

I ordered the eggplant sandwich. I stood in front of the counter to to see how my food is prepared. Unfortunately, the girl didn't wear gloves and she is putting the ingredients with her hands. Moreover, the boy how took our order left the cash register and started to cut some raw meat,then, he grabbed my bun ,again with out gloves so disgusting!
 I couldn't eat my sandwich and I don't know why I didn't say anything, I think I was shocked. 
piece of advise: use gloves!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say that my rating is not regarding the food, the veal sandwich is always delicious! I grew up coming here with my dad and now I still pop in at least once a month to buy it. My rating is for the customer service that has changed drastically over the last few months.

I don't know if the place has changed owners, but the front counter staff has definitely changed with some new faces. But one in particular just needs to pack up her apron and go. Don't know her name, she is a malato girl. The first time I saw her there was a few months ago, I found her to be a bit unfriendly towards myself and outright rude to another customer. I thought perhaps she is having an off day (we all have them, although that shouldn't be used as an excuse). On my second visit, she came out with the same unpleasant demeanor. Today I was in there and I'm sorry but she is just outright miserable. I greeted her with a hello as I came in and she didn't  answer - never does. On my way out, I said 'thank you, have a nice weekend'...she didn't even budge. Its unfortunate that this is the UNwelcome that customers get, if it weren't for the food - nothing would drag me back in there."}
{"text":"I had all intention of heading to Bitondo's today after my workout, but when I arrived there was no one at the counter and I didn't make an effort to wait too long or peek into the kitchen as I was hungry, so I simply decided to go across the street to San Francesco where I know I will be greeted right away and served a delicious sandwich.

I was greeted immediately after I entered as expected and since I knew exactly what I wanted, I ordered the veal sandwich with mushrooms and asked for medium which equates to a few hot peppers added to the sandwich.

I've been coming here for many years (since my high school days) and there always seems to be competition between Bitondo and San Francesco, but in my hungry state this place serves the purpose with customer service.  Both places serves great sandwiches, but with Bitondo's being known as a Pizzeria, I'll give San Francesco's my vote for best sandwiches especially their veal and eggplant sandwiches.

The bread is always fresh (no crusty or day old bread here), the veal lightly breaded and fried to a nice crisp,  The veal always tender and tasty, plus the sauce is flavourful and sweet, not salty tasting like other places, mushrooms are freshly sauteed, plus the hot peppers adds a nice little kick to the flavours which blends all so beautifully together and taste oh so good.  It really is as good as it gets.  Woohoo!

I have to admit after all these years, I have yet to try their pizzas or other Italian foods as I only come here for their sandwiches, so review is strictly based on the veal sandwich and fact after all the years, the sandwiches still remained consistent  with every visit and taste exactly how I remembered the sandwiches as a teenager.  

Located a little off the beaten path on Clinton just south of College Street, this place is really a neighbourhood hidden gem."}
{"text":"Killer Veal Sandwiches! Tender, excellent sauce, nice fresh buns and generous serving of cheese with it. A Toronto landmark, tucked away in little Italy. Worth seeking out for a bite. Must indulge in more of the menu when I get the chance"}
{"text":"This place makes the best take-out veal sandwich. For eat in, it's probably the worst because there is only room for about 5 people to stand in a line in there. I even bought one of those shitty baseball caps they sell above the proscuitto (4 bucks, by the way). 

Bitonodo's across the street is the same price ($6.50 after HST)  and there is seating but their sauce is a little sweet and the feel of the place seems less authentic. 

Get it spicy with a large chocolate milk. You're in heaven."}
{"text":"If you like your olives hot and spice this is the place and they sell the best Pepperoni also no one can beat this place."}
{"text":"The most amazing veal sandwich. 
I can't say it better than Dil. F. But I will add that I have been enjoying this place for about 25 years. I usually get the sweet veal sandwich with no toppings. But please don't let my nostalgic routine stop you from adding mushrooms, cheese, spicy jalapenos, whatever your pleasure. 

Take it out or you can go upstairs to the Monarch Tavern and enjoy it with a beer. 

If you haven't tried this place yet, you are really missing out."}
{"text":"Service, Service, Service. It's still, and always will be the heart of great business. 
And San Francesco's has got it figured out. It may have something to do with spending your whole life in a family business. But I always feel welcome and like my business is appreciated. Oh and I can't complain about the sandwiches. Always on point. I love this place."}
{"text":"End of an era indeed.  I feel like an old friend just died.

It's really hard to give this place an accurate rating.  I've been coming here since I was a baby potato and its now gone...tear :(   My dad introduced me to the amazing veal sandwich and I've been coming here my whole life.

I passed by recently and noticed the new layout...they opened up a seating area by removing the deli counter.  Smart move.  Then I noticed some new girl working, new menu...and I got scared.  Oh God! Please dont change the recipe!!   And sadly, they did.  You can tell they tried to keep it the same, but it didn't taste the same.    

I've always said this place should expand...I'd love to buy the business and sell the sandwiches to compete with California...because this place is a hidden gem.  But the key is the recipe.  And the new owners obviously didn't get it.

So, if its your first time here you'll most likely enjoy it.  It's not bad.  If you've been coming here for years,  you'll be heartbroken."}
{"text":"Thanks for the stale bun, it went well with the over cooked veal. Sandwich fail. 

I ordered a veal sandwich and poutine for delivery (Foodora) and was disappointed by both. The bun was stale, but oddly only the bottom half, and some of the veal was over cooked. The poutine tasted like frozen fries, canned gravy, and mediocre cheese curds. I won't be ordering from them again. 

I'll stick with California sandwiches from now on."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about the nearby California Sandwiches and I'd be remiss if I didn't write about San Francesco also. I said that California was the best but this place is pretty much even for their sandwiches. Either way, you can't go wrong. If I'm in the mood for sandwiches, I often feel like getting a sandwich from both of these places so I can get both their flavours. Yeah, I'm a pig but you only live once!"}
{"text":"Lots of options in comparison to some of the other Italian sandwich shops.  I love that they have a whole wheat bun option.   Bonus points for having a good recycling facility.   They have options for payment other than just cash only like some places.   People come from far away, and there is a fairly constant lineup here.   I like that they have about 12 chairs so that at least some people can sit down, and there is a 2 person bench outside as well.

I like that they have the option of grilled chicken, it is a lot healthier than crispy chicken, and lets people decide.    I added mushrooms and eggplant to mine, which were a dollar each extra."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich is so delicious! I got it spicy and it was VERY spicy! The veal is so tender and they give you so much! I don't usually eat veal but I found myself enjoying every tasty tender bite. Service was friendly too which is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute institution. My father has gone her since he was a teenager and I have gone my entire life. 

There is nothing better than their hot veal sandwiches which you can get 'sweet' with no peppers or 'medium' or 'hot' with peppers. 

I don't indulge often, but the hot cacciatore sausage is the best. 

The restaurant changed hands in the past year. While I miss the old faces and the old set up, the new people have cleaned the place up and are still making the same great food. The only thing is I have noticed that at time they do not add enough sauce and dip one side of the sandwich fully in the delicious sauce. This can be solved by simply asking for extra sauce."}
{"text":"Best steak sandwich I've ever had hands down. 

The five star review is based solely on the steak sandwich. If you're looking for a veal sandwich I'd recommend California sandwiches around the corner (Cali for veal, San frans for steak)

Back to the sandwich: the bun is amazing, great steak, add in peppers and onions and you're in sandwich heaven. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"If you're going to San Francesco Foods, be sure to wear a hair tie in your hair, for when you go to San Francesco Foods, you're gonna encounter some dripping gravy there and you don't want to get it all over your hair, even if you are a hippie from the 60s.

What to get: The Veal Sandwich... yumm.
What else: Well, it depends on how you Veal.

Their famous Veal Sandwich is obviously not that famous on Yelp, but it should be, because it's one of the best and juiciest sandwiches in Canada's largest metro area. It wasn't the best thing I've ever tasted, but in a city which has often thrown underwhelming food at me (literally, when I performed on stage, usually in the form of rotten vegetables), this was a real treat. I was starving, and every drop of the juicy gravy and vivacious Veal (oh crap I just misused that word) went down well.

The sandwich didn't save very well (I got another one for later), got very soggy and wasn't as much fun cold... so eat it right when you get it. And I'd recommend adding some peppers and onions and stuff to it, otherwise it can be a bit bland. But every visitor to Toronto and lover of juicy sandwiches, should stop by here one evening and check it out. It's worth it, even moreso than Fifth Harmony.

And no Moez, the sandwiches have just the right amazing delicious amount of oil. Putting a ton of oil on something is never a bad idea, and I'm not just talking about food.

Wanna take a trip with me? I feel like they might have good Veal sandwiches in France-le'sgo!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best veal sandwich in town. Nice, large, tasty and quick.

Sam said it all in his review. This is simple quick lunch or occasional fare. Bring your appetite, it is ample!

Nicely spiced too....not too hot."}
{"text":"Panzarotti big enough for 2 plates and 2 people. $5.50.   Spicy olives.  Hot sausage.  A fixture in Little Italy, a place like this couldn't be opened today."}
{"text":"I don't know how to write this review without being bombastic and ridiculous.

Don't let the fact that this is technically a chain fool you: the Clinton San Francesco is god-tier Italian sandwiches. The sausage and meatball sandwiches are to die for, and the price is so ridiculously low that if you haven't yet tried it you are basically dead to me.

Let me put it this: I would be willing to pay so that the \"Daym Drops\" dude would come to Toronto just to try the sandwiches here, because it would likely result in an all-time favourite episodes."}
{"text":"Best hot veal sandwich in Toronto. Specialty meats and import Italian goods.

You owe it to yourself, to your humanity and sense of self-worth, to visit San Francesco's deli and order a hot veal sandwich, and ask for cheese and mushrooms as add-ons. Oh dear lord we've reached the mountain top of hot meats.

FOUR effin' layers of breaded, tender veal are draped in an aromatic marinara sauce and piled high into the freshest kaiser roll you've ever sank teeth into. If you go with the add-ons, you're looking at two slices of fresh provolone and juicy plump sauteed mushroom halves... yes! mushroom HALVES!  This sandwich is absolutely divine. Because I'm a weakling when it comes to heat, I always ordered mine \"sweet\", but you can order \"medium\" or \"hot\" which will include a small (or large) pile of fiery hot jalapeños, seeds and all. I watched my dad, who loves hot food, weep like a baby - which recommends the sandwich. 

The kicker is that you can take (actually you're encouraged to take) the best veal sandwich in Toronto right next door, up the dark and gloomy flight of stairs to the upper-deck Monarch Tavern, where you can order some classic English and Irish ales (in addition to your two-bit Canadian lagers) while you scarf down your tender veal.

The deli has a few other like-sandwiches on the menu (meatball sub, chicken parmesan, etc.) but the veal is the best. You can also get some locally baked breads, a lot of rare Italian dry sausages, and some prepackaged import baked goods, like cookies.

If you don't live in Little Italy, I recommend a thorough Google Maps study. It's just below College St. on Clinton, but the one-ways and dead-ends around the area can frustrate your first attempts at locating this small miracle by car."}
{"text":"On a day trip to Toronto, I had to stop at San Francesco. The last time I had San Francesco's veal sandwich was in 1978. The 2018 version did not disappoint. It was just as tasty good as I remembered them to be and the sandwich transported me back to my 8 year old self for just a moment."}
{"text":"My favorite place anywhere to get a veal or steak sandwiches, their pizza is great too but I love thier sandwiches. My family have been eat at this place since I was a kid, everyone I bring to this place loves it."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the breaded veal sandwich. The breading is very similar to milanesa and it comes on a great bun which has just enough moisture from this spicy tomato sauce that's slathered inside, though not so much so that the sandwich is terribly messy. Still, I wouldn't wait too long to eat it since sogginess could really become an issue probably pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Not fancy, not expensive, delicious! I don't generally like Italian food, but I've heard so many good things about the veal sandwich, even I was excited to try it. This place is tucked away on a side street, so you know the food is solid, given the number of years it's been in business. 

Came here with my fiancé, his cousin and the cousin's gf. We all got veal sandwiches in varying heats. I tried the hot sandwich, and it was delicious! The peppers give it heat, and I'm pretty sure the difference between medium and spicy is simply the number of peppers on the sandwich. It was hot, flavorful, and very filing!

They offer other menu items (mostly other sandwiches and pizza), but from what I saw on other tables, there's no reason to stray from the veal sandwich."}
{"text":"Not expensive, not at all. $6.5 for a huge sandwich with real steak.. And It Is Delicious!!! If you live somewhere close to this restaurant, come and check it out, you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"You can tell the food is retro the mozzarella on the frozen pizza tasted like the 60's 
I would never recommend their pizza~coming from NYC     It SUCKED or the grilled chicken ~ it was dry that I choked on it.
I'm so disappointed because it's a cute town to visit but not to eat. Walking in I should have realized it wasn't the right choice because of the owner's lack of personality :("}
{"text":"Can't get enough of these veal sandwiches. Add in the peppers and you've got yourself a treat. I stumbled across this place trying to take a shortcut and decided to try the sandwiches because I saw a billboard of it before. The bread is on point and I could eat them on their own. The sauce is true to Italian sandwiches and full of flavour. The veal is delicious and is cooked well. All in all, great place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing meatball subs. Havent tried anything else yet but hear the pizza is also great! Super cheap, super friendly, super deelish."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
You could say this is an interim review until I try San Francesco's again, but on first try I was slightly disappointed.
Maybe they were ready to go home that Saturday night, maybe the halved mushrooms that had ran out could have made all the difference, or maybe the poor veal that ended up in the sandwich was fed something unsavoury. Whatever it was, the sandwich was not that great. The cut was fine (not chewy), the cheese was barely detectable, the jalapeno had the most personality, and the kaiser roll was just a kaiser roll (obviously. I always get surprised at people getting excited for kaiser rolls)

That being said, the staff are super cool. The girl at the register almost made up for the mediocre sangwich! She informed us that San Francesco's has been open for more than 60 years and her family has operated it for the last 30 yrs. We also got to try some of the packed dried sausage (looks like chorizo), which is made in house and tastes great. I'll definitely pick some up the next time I visit.

Again, I look forward to hopefully updating this review after a few more tries b/c I do love the people and the space!

Note: the only seating space is a bench outside the shop"}
{"text":"My Father came here back in the 70's, and every time he comes to visit the first thing we do is grab a breaded veal sandwich from San Francesco Foods. Some new kids bought it out but it has the same feel. This place is fantastical and I look forward to eating there for decades to come."}
{"text":"Ah, I feel a little terrible giving three stars but I think that's an honest rating at the end of the day. 

My girlfriend and I decided to make a trip to Little Italy because neither of us had been before, so we jumped on Yelp and decided to find a good place to go. San Francesco Foods is what we decided upon after reading the ratings. What we were expecting was a little family run shop with great Italian sandwiches. We got the former, not so much the latter. Don't get me wrong, it was good; just nothing special. 

The place was small. One larger table and two small ones. There was one person behind the cash and after going over the sandwich menu, we decided to order a veal sandwich and a small grilled chicken one, both with hot peppers, mushrooms and onions. The girl seemed a bit confused and rushed with the orders she was taking, running back and forth between the cashier and the kitchen. Eventually we got our food, and the orders were correct, so I can't complain about that. 

One major problem we had with the sandwiches were that they were way too oily. They definitely tasted good, but the oil was dripping all over the place. On the plus side, the sandwiches were nice and big and would make for a very fulfilling meal. Also, the mushrooms and onions were grilled which is always a positive. In the end, we decided that the grilled chicken was probably better than the veal sandwich (even though the veal one is what they're known for). 

Oh, and both were under $10. 

Side note: while we were there, two-three people walked in just to buy their olives. There's probably something special about them."}
{"text":"Very tasty veal sandwiches.  If you've never tried one, are in or around Little Italy, and looking for a satisfying bite, I'd recommend picking one up.  It's 6 bucks and it is a pretty good size.  The bread and butter of this establishment is the sandwiches, though they also sell pizza and other Italian foods.

As for a bit more detail about the sandwich - its all good - see the pic - bun, bun to meat ratio, sauce quality/amount, meat quality/amount, spiciness.  The bun is white kaiser.  The meat is breaded veal.  Sauce is tomato.  The picture is of the spicy veal 'cause that's how I roll- the green things are peppers.  You don't have to get the peppers, but c'mon, live a little.

Other points:

- Service is efficient - usually takes 4-5 minutes to make the sandwich.
- You can call ahead and have it ready when you pick up.
- Nowhere to sit inside, there is a bench outside.
- They also serve other sandwiches - but I rarely hear anything but veal or steak being picked up."}
{"text":"I had a veal sandwich with onions ($0.39) and jalapenos (free). It was ~$10 and not great. There was a lot of food, but the veal wasn't particularly tasty. Both of the toppings were kind of gross. The bun was good, I guess. Very greasy, but I know that's part of the appeal of these kinds of places.

I really think it should be some sort of crime for these Italian sandwich places to charge an extra $2 for cheese. I didn't even realize my sandwich would be cheeseless until it was too late.

Anyway, if you want a $10 sandwich there are plenty of better places."}
{"text":"I had the veal sandwich and it was disgusting, stay away if you know whats good for you."}
