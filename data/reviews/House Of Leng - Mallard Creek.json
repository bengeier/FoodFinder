{"text":"I love the food at House of Leng.  it's a great bargain at lunch... quck service and huge portions.  The dinner menu is more pricey and the portions are slightly bigger, but lunch is the strong point here.  I've tried almost everything on teh menu and I love it all!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Charlotte from Chicago 2 years ago I've been looking for a good Chinese take out place.  Back home you could find one every couple of blocks and my absolute favorite is Wing Wah (Oh, how I miss you, cue the water works.)    I had tried a few places here and nothing came even close to my most cherished Wing Wah.  I'm used to fried rice being brown thanks to that yummy, salty soy sauce, not white like what I'd gotten here.  Fried rice should not be white!    After being let down so many times I just gave up on finding Chinese take out.  Then, one day I was informed of House of Leng.  I scoffed at the recommendation because my heart  nor my taste buds could take the potential disappointment.  However, one evening when the Chinese food craving bug kept biting me I decided to give House of Leng a try.  I ordered the Orange Chicken with fried rice.  Yes!  The rice was actually brown and tasty.  The chicken was okay just not my favorite.  Naturally I had mixed feelings but did at least have some place to go to if I just wanted fried rice.  A couple of days later my co-workers were going to House of Leng for lunch and invited me to go so I did.    Based on a recommendation, I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken with, you guessed it, fried rice.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  The chicken was delicious and went perfectly with the fried rice.  Portions were large yet I ate everything on my plate.  My co-workers all starred at me in shock because they are always teasing me about my picky eating habits.  Even better was that my meal was only $8 or $9.  Say What!?  I still miss Wing Wah, but the longing isn't as strong as it once was.  Finally, I've found my Chinese take out place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing great. The egg rolls they served my girlfriend and I tasted freezer burned. The service was very unprofessional. Our server yelled from the table next to us to the cashier asking to bring them to go boxes. Probably will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. It as a good clean taste. Only thing is many of sauces on the dishes taste too similar."}
{"text":"Always a solid meal when I visit Charlotte. Lots of options and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   Eaten there 2x and was not impressed to say the least the food is bland and have left disappointed both times."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like. When getting take-out, it is easy to get in and out. Will definitely keep you coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'd consider it more fusion than Asian.  But whatever the car the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I enjoy their good which is why I drove there today in the pouring rain. I ordered soup and shrimp Lo mein to go. That evening I opened my Lo mein only to discover there was not even a single shrimp to be found. I called them to complain and they said being it back. Extremely annoyed I returned and all they did was apologize, give me another Lo mein and added one egg roll as my compensation! Never mind the gas and additional 30 minutes out of my life because of their stupid error! Who does that...how the hell you forget to add shrimp to shrimp Lo mein? They showed poor business ethics to a loyal customer, plus they reused the noodles because when I plated them at home they were broken up. I must pass 4 or 5 Chinese restaurants on my way to theirs. Needless to say everyone makes mistakes but I'm extremely disappointed in how they handled the situation and may not be returning again. They didn't show they cared about the mistake so I no longer care to spend my hard earned $$ there. They will probably delete this review."}
{"text":"Love, Love,,Love the food here. I found them while staying on that side of town. I live on opposite side of town and still drive up there when I want Chinese food. Yummy"}
{"text":"Truly my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte but also close to 20 miles from home but well worth it for me when I'm in the area. Menu could be a bit overwhelming with so many good choices but have yet to be disappointed.  If you love noodles, try the beef chow fun, one of my favorites along with Chicken and green beans with black bean sauce."}
{"text":"The food was good but the staff lacked personality and drive. A little pricey for what it is. Basic take out.  Was somewhat warm inside"}
{"text":"I do not understand the reviews that they have been given so far.  I ordered the chicken with chili sauce.  The chili sauce was simply sweet and sour sauce with very little heat, if any at all.  The rice was fried earlier in the day and just kept warm.  If you are not from here, meaning Charlotte, and you have experienced Chinese food deeper south, farther north or further west, you will likely be disappointed.  I do not believe I will return. Just to give you an idea of how bad it was, I had a lot leftover that made it's way to the trash.   As far as service is concerned, they seemed pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Going out to eat is also about service and the experience, not just the food. This place used to be great at it all. We have been coming here for 10 years. Now it's a high turnover nickel and dime place. No one stays. It's always a new waitstaff these days. I was shocked at the level of service here, especially when one of the older waitresses took back my check and hand wrote an extra 1.20 for rice. Never happened before. It's not the 1.20, it's the way she snarled back with the check making sure we saw we got charged for that extra bowl of rice we asked for. Horrible taste in our mouth.  My husband and I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or leave in disgust and frustration."}
{"text":"I've dined at House of Leng numerous times, as it is conveniently located across from my office park. I am not an advocate of this place, as the food here is less than average. The quality is fair/average; however, the food is not pleasant or tasty.   I really wanted to enjoy this place because of its convenience. I've eaten here about 5-6 times with co-workers and ordered different dishes each time. It's doubtful that I will return here unless attending a group luncheon."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the House of Leng since it opened a few years back. My parents usually eat there about once a week and never have any complaints. I have tried everything on the menu from the Chicken Lettuce Wraps to the Garlic Scallops. The Lo Mien is great and so is the Sesame Shrimp. I could name off quite a few delicious options but you should try it for yourself. I recommend going during lunch which is served until 3:00. This is an inexpensive way to sample what they have to offer and with each plate you get an egg roll and fried rice."}
{"text":"Decent average Chinese. Entrees are pricey but large. Entrees come with white rice. They don't deliver though."}
{"text":"Last two visits service and food were spot on.  When it's good it's the best Chinese food in the University area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food places in the area. Take out is quick and sit down service is usually fast as well. A little more on the higher price for Chinese but it is worth it and quality is overall better."}
{"text":"Disagree with reviews!!! I ordered General Tso chicken. This dish wasn't hot nor sweet at all. I ordered fried rice versus white rice. The rice seems stale and old. Yuck, yuck, yuck."}
{"text":"Meh is right. Although this is probably the best of many poor options in North Charlotte, it's still not much to speak of. We ordered the Peking Duck which was overwhelmingly salty, and it came with tortillas instead of pancakes. Tortillas!   I think they probably either ran out of the ingredients, or whoever made them was out that day since it took so long I think they ran to the store and bought them. Why turn down a perfectly good $30 order if you don;t have the ingredients? Just pile some slop on a plate and send it out. Any restaurant that would do that is not worth going to in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ate here constantly when I lived in the University area. They're a great break from your run-of-the-mill Chinese food. Much fresher and tastier.  Decor is contemporary, prices aren't high, if you're there for dinner you'll always end up with leftovers and service is friendly and attentive. They'll even wrap your moo shu for you tableside, which is a show in and of itself.  My personal favorites: chicken lettuce wraps (amazing), eggplant stir-fry, house lo mien, anything involving broccoli (but I love broccoli).  You can stay under $10 for lunch, dinner with an app will cost you a bit more, depending on what you're in the mood for.  Take out can take a bit, but wait times aren't extraordinarily long."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst food I've had in a while. From the noodles to the shrimp it was like they just made it quickly. The taste was bland as well and I will not go here anymore. I used to go here often but there food has fallen off big time. Find a different spot to go to hands down the food was nasty."}
{"text":"Between my mom and I, we eat here about once a week.  The food is always great.  I haven't tried a thing yet that I didn't care for.  The chicken lettuce wraps are very good.  They are served with a plum sauce.   The general's tofu is amazing if you are vegetarian!  Lightly fried, crispy, and served with a sweet, mildly spicy, garlicy brown sauce.  Yum!  The ginger chicken and curry chicken are also other favorites.   After eating here, other local take-out Chinese places wont' cut it anymore.   If you choose to dine-in, the wait staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I put in an order for delivery here.  When I got it, the food was still hot and you can tell they didn't leave it sitting around for a long time. I ordered the orange chicken, steamed pork dumplings, and a spring roll.   The spring roll was fried nicely, very crisp the way I like it.  The chicken was tender and there was so much, I could likely have three meals out of it.  Dumplings were good."}
{"text":"My husband and I work very close to House of Leng and eat here at least once a week, with each other or with our friends from work. The service is quick and the food is delicious. Hands down the best Chinese spot in the university area."}
{"text":"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CHINESE RESTAURANT!! I have been a huge fan since the first day I went years ago. I can't find another Chinese restaurant that compares. The food is always fresh and full of flavor. A nice variety as well. The inside has a nice dining atmosphere compared to a lot of Chinese restaurants. The staff/owners are very nice. I really couldn't say anything bad about House of Leng. A huge recommendation for anyone who loves Chinese food as much as I do!"}
{"text":"the best chinese restaurant in town. the crispy scallion chicken is amazing! you get SO much food for the price you pay and I've never had anything bad. one of my favorite restaurants in town"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but seems that it may have changed hands or management. The service is extremely slow and the food is not as good as it once was. Also whatever they clean the tables with is causing them to become sticky making the place feel dirty. It is sad as this WAS the best Chinese place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Time to update my review.  It's only fair to give a higher rating to a place that I routinely frequent.  Recommended menu items:  VEGETARIAN- Spinach Dumplings Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (add broccoli or other veggies for more well rounded meal) General's Tofu (ask for extra extra crispy - even non-vegetarians will like it)  NON-VEG- Chicken Lettuce Wraps Anything with Spicy Garlic Sauce (ask for extra, it's delicious) Orange Chicken or Sesame Chicken (ask for all white meat if you prefer that - they're happy to accommodate)  Dine-in is SIGNIFICANTLY better than take out, especially for fried items.  Service lately has been a lot better and friendlier."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place! Excellent food. Quick service. And it doesn't break the bank. The asparagus and chicken is delightful. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Its kind of hard to differentiate the generic strip mall \"Chinese\" restaurants these days, but this one was a step above.  Decor was nice, the service was quick, and the food was good.  When I walked in I really liked the decor.  Tall ceilings, nice warm colors, and more of a restaurant feel than most places of this genre.  As soon as I walked in the door a man who looked like he owned the place, walked right up to us promptly to ask us how many.  As soon as we were seated we were asked what drinks we wanted.  This was for lunch so they had no problem getting us in and out quickly.  The food, AKA what really matters.  I had the general chicken, yes it was called general chicken, not general's or general tso's.  The sauce was a  little different than what I was thinking, but it was good.  There were some somewhat \"real\" Chinese dishes available, which I would like to try, but will save the for next time.  Most of the lunch dishes were either 5.79 or 6.99 and came with an eggroll/spring roll.  All in all, nothing amazing, but definitely edible, especially if you work in the area.  I won't go out of my way to eat there, but will definitely pay them a visit again."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! The specials are very inexpensive and you get a lot of food! I always have leftovers for the next day. Very classy looking inside.   The mood of the staff varies. One time my friend and I ordered different meals, but they both came with rice. They waitress just gave us one plate of rice to share, and it definitely wasn't enough for two people. But another time, I had great service from one of the other waitresses. It just depends I guess.   But the food is amazing and worth everything. My favorites are the chicken lo mein, the new t-chicken, and the crispy scallion chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The fact i can quickly order exactly what I want and set the time I want right online is a win! Food is always fresh and piping hot."}
{"text":"My family and I used to eat here all the time. It was our go-to place if we wanted Chinese food.   We had been long standing happy customers until one evening we decided to order take-out. When I arrived to pick up our food, I was surprised to see that the food was ready and waiting (we only live 2.5 miles away).  Not thinking much about it I paid for the food and went home. When we began to eat we were once again surprised that our food was cold, disgusting and wrong.  At this point, no big deal as we have always had great food at this location.   Here is where the biggest suprise of the evening occurs...  My wife called back to management to let them know what had happened. We figured we would get an \"I'm sorry\" and replacement of our food. Not too much to ask. We were polite and understanding about the whole thing.   The response we received was not even close. The guy started by saying that if we would not have waited a half-hour to pick up our food, it would have been fresh.  This was not the case and blew my mind as it my have taken 10 minutes at the latest.   My wife goes on to mention that her chicken did not taste right. The manager then says that maybe they served her \"duck\".   So, my wife asks for our food to be remade. The guy refused. My wife then asks for our money back and the guy tells her no, reiterating that is our fault we took so long to pick up the food.  On top of his refusals to make things right, the man is rude regarding the issue.    Looking back I believe we got someone elses food who failed to pick it up. That would explain the duck order vs. the chicken dish ordered.  So, rather than wasting food which is money out of their pocket, they passed it on to what were loyal customers who they had seen many times eating at their establishment.    Then when we called to complain (at this time we were not upset or suspecting anything out of the norm) we were met with a less than a professional attitude.  Not good for business...  Never again.    Try Asian Cafe in Kannapolis (near Target shopping center beside Buffalo Wild Wings).   Great food, good pricing, nice atmosphere and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying fried rice should NEVER be yellow...it should be BROWN. House of Leng is thee only Chinese place I have found in NC that makes brown fried rice, and the taste is a testimony to the difference between the two. I have ordered here twice now, and it has been great both times. I got orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, veggie chow fun, and some fried rice. All was very delicious, and reasonably priced with large portions. Their crab rangoons are lacking in size, and there is not enough filling, but other than that, this place is on the top of my list for go-to Chinese places.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is always consistently good. I always get the sesame chicken with sweet tea. I'm a huge Boba tea fan and the past 3 times I've ordered their Boba tea the pearls are barely edible. They are the consistency of liquorice instead of gummies. The food though...can't beat it."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a visit to the House of Leng.  The sweet and sour shrimp is the best.  The quality of the food and service is consistent with each visit.  Kids love the chicken with mixed veggies."}
{"text":"Look no further when you're looking for a cute and casual sit-down chinese restaurant that offers good food with quality efficient service. The atmosphere is really nice since the place is clean and the walls are modernly decorated.   The food is delicious. The portions are hefty.  The value is great. Mmmmm...."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for either dine-in or take-out for last 10 years. The quality of service has gone down. On top of that, the service always sucked and got worse in the past few years. Last time I dined in, this young server's demeanor was extremely rude and street-like"}
{"text":"I JUST order take out f pod earlier. When I got to my job, realize that there's no silverware. I called back, and their response was \" we give out silverware for dinner take out\". Wow that was the first restaurant that I will never do business with again. Cheap ass business owner..."}
{"text":"Yum, my mouth waters when I mention House of Leng.  I've been to a variety of Chinese restaurants  and I have to say that this place is by far the best one in Charlotte.  The price is great for the amount and quality of food you get.  Dinner may be a little more expensive but the portion is well worth it.  The food always tastes great and the service is outstanding.  I actually think the host/waiter/bust boy is pretty hot.  As far as take out, I have not had any issues. I live approximately 15 minutes away and by the time I get home, my food has always been hot. My favorite is the Shrimp Lo Mein, it is to die for!!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been coming here for years. We love in the north end of the county, so we always consider it a treat to come for lunch or dinner. Well that was the last time. Service was horrible. One of the Wait staff were dressed in ripped jeans and a tank top and another was dirty and disheveled. Food was greasy and not the usual good taste. The owner looked like she had pink eye or some kind of eye infection, while eating corn on the cob behind the counter (gross). The final straw was spotting the 90% rating posted after my hubby was commenting how dirty the restaurant was. The tables were sticky and the soy sauce container was crusted over on the outside.  We will not be back. We will stick to House of Taipei."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick lunch while waiting for dr. appt. Just told to take any table. did so. Waiter comes along takes drink order. Then another waiter comes along takes drink order again. My husband orders Icehouse. They are gone for about five minutes. Then we are told no Icehouse. So he orders a Heineken. My tea comes, a bottle is put on the table. We ask for a glass. that comes we say we are ready to order. The place has a couple of tables filled. We order. More people come in, order, get their meals. Us. Nothing.  After about 15 minutes my meal comes out, but not my husband's. We wait. after about 5/6 minutes I go up to the counter and ask because the wait staff keeps walking by but no one comes to our table. Nothing. We wait. I go up again! Finally after about 10/12 minutes his meal comes. I am done with mine. No offer to refill my tea. Waitstaff just zoom by our table until my husband grabs a waitperson as they are going by for boxes and the check.   The check is almost tossed on the table with a \"sorry for the delay.\" If there was anything less than a one star, this place would get it!  The food may be good--but the service left a lasting bad taste. We go often to this area. This will not be one of our stopovers--ever!"}
{"text":"Food taste is standard.  Dont expect great  Little salty overall.  Waitress isnt friendly."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and ordered the sesame chicken and chicken fried rice. I've eaten here in the past and it was nothing like it used to be! The rice was greasy. The sesame chicken was okay but nothing special.  The service was terrible! I never got a refill on my drink and when I complained as I was leaving the manager said they were short staffed despite the fact there were only 3 tables in the restaurant and waiters rolling silverware! We never had the waiter come back after bringing the food. Between the mediocre food and bad service...I would find a better chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and consistent. Love the noodles, chicken and seafood. We stop here every time we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible. The teenage waiter and waitress was rude and seemed the annoyed the whole time he was serving us. It made it uncomfortable to enjoy the meal. Every time my friends and I asked for something they would give us an attitude. I don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Food is great, this is my \"go to\" Chinese food spot, but the young guy that answers the phone to take To Go orders should sound a bit more energetic. He sounds like you are bothering him when you call, speaks really low, and is unprofessional. Paying customers should feel like the restaurant they are calling wants their business."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in North Charlotte.  Whether you dine in or carry out they will always get your order right and the staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this brief b/c I'm pissed at myself for even going - ah, it was my own laziness, so no one else to blame but myself.  I work across the street and wanted Chinese food.  So I stopped and got my usual take out order.  It's enough food to have probably 3 full meals.  It consists of:  steamed dumplings, garlic beef and Chinese donuts.  Here's where the laziness comes in, I usually get delivery from another place closer to my house, but I didn't want to wait...gut must have food NOW.  So I figured let's try House of Leng.    Firstly I believe I got gypped out of a egg roll.  Don't dinners always come with an egg roll?  2ndly, the price was about 5 bucks more than my usual place for LESS food.  Finally all of this being said I'd have been less pissed had the food actually been good.  but it wasn't.  Sigh...live and learn.  Next time the gut begs for Chinese food I'm just going to go with old faithful, even if it means I have to wait for delivery."}
{"text":"House of Leng is always my go to restaurant for dine in or take out Chinese food in Charlotte. Great portions for a good price. I never have to wonder if the food is fresh or \"real\"meat I always see the owner buying ingredients at the Harris Teeter next door :)"}
{"text":"I will never go back customer  services  was horrible. They fix the  wrong   food  . they didn't  want to give me my money back.the food  was horrible and over price."}
{"text":"Perfect for a lunch place... Especially since I worked at TIAA-CREF, this place is one of the favorites for everyone there trying to get a quick lunch and back to the office. I ordered an easy dish when I came here, sesame chicken with an eggroll as well as an appetizer of pork dumplings. (which are better in my opinion if you get them get it pan fried!)  The waiter was very nice and helpful. (This also includes the whole staff!) Anyways, in short.. if you're craving for a quick chinese cuisine lunch, then this is the place to stop by!"}
{"text":"I love house of leng! Best Chinese food that I have eaten. I blame my 35 extra pounds on HOL. Amazing food and excellent service. I would recommend the spicy chicken with eggplant, chicken wings, sesame chicken and generals gau's chicken. I miss house of leng!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed when I ate at the House of Leng. I had a pretty large order that consist of a family of four and $60 worth of food. I felt bad because the family wanted to eat at another local Chinese restaurant and I insist on this place which I thought was going to be REALLY GOOD. I was wrong. I haven't been here in a couple of yrs. It was really good back then.I don't know if they changed management but I will not be returning back. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli w/ garlic sauce and brown rice. Is it me but how come when I ask a Chinese restaurant for brown rice they think I'm talking about fried rice. NO!!! The rice was kind of hard and stale. The shrimp and garlic sauce was a bit on the salty side.   The rest of the food that the family ate was nothing to write about. You would think since it's conventionally located in a popular shopping plaza they would keep you coming back for more. Sorry house of Leng I'm no longer a fan. Where can I get some descent Chinese food in north Charlotte?"}
{"text":"Ever since House of Leng grew & expanded into a second location it seems that the quality of the original location has been diminishing weekly.   I used to love this location but lately the quality & service as been off.  The older lady at the front alway looks like she has BEEF with you! & the teenager waiters act like they have better things to do then serving you, not friendly.  The food is a complete downgrade from their other location off of JM Keynes Dr.  I always promise not to ever go back to this location, but I find myself trying to give them a second chance for my love of the chain! . . . Recommendations= drive 10 more minutes to \"JM Keynes Dr.\" for a better experience."}
{"text":"Good Resturant for lunch! I've been a customer for 10+ years and will continue to patronize this facility."}
{"text":"House of Leng is a great lunch spot--the lunch specials are super cheap. The sesame tofu is really good."}
{"text":"My family started to eat at House of Leng about 6 years ago. We fell in love with the food and house fast they are willing to explain what is in what dish. We moved a year ago and can not find a great place such as House of Leng."}
{"text":"This is now my new Chinese spot! Their wings! OMG I LOVE THEM! I DON'T EVEN EAT WINGS! They also have the best spring rolls in Charlotte! I'm sure whatever you order there will be delicious!"}
{"text":"House of Leng is my favorite Asian restaurant to visit in the Mallard Creek Church/Prosperity Church Road area. The friendly service and tasty food keep me coming back . I also love the University City Boardwalk location as well. The lunch and dinner portions are big enough to make two meals, which is a plus."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese place. Pretty much everything is good. Chicken & Shrimp w/broccoli is my fave."}
{"text":"Love this Chinese food! Always good- For years!!! Crispy scallion chicken, beef a. And broccoli, shrimp fried rice. I look forward to being in this vicinity as I make much effort to visit!"}
{"text":"It's very convent spot right next to Harris Teeter. One of the cool thing about this place is I never had to wait to be seated. I like to go here for lunch however I been here for dinner as well. This is cute little Chinese place which gets full pretty quick as Bill pointed out.   My favorite is Veg Lo mien  with garlic sauce and mix veg with fried rice cooked in garlic sauce.  They make great food, service is good and they try to keep it clean."}
{"text":"This place is top notch and food is as good as you can get. I haven't been disappointed yet, and at this rate I don't think I ever will be."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, but that didn't matter. The staff was the same, and so was the food and service! Very good! Better than their sister location near the hilton off harris and tryon! All the food came out Hot & fresh full of flavor. It seemed to be more of a take out spot because the orders were stacked up behind the counter. No matter if you eat in or take out this location shouldn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in charlotte university. Amazing dishes with huge quantity. Love the sesame chicken. A+++"}
{"text":"The food was not very good. The veggies in my sweet and sour chicken were completely raw. I felt like the ladies working there were giving me dirty looks, but I shrugged it off as paranoia. I hadn't given them any reason to dislike me. They brought me the bill and I gave them my card. When they brought it back, I noticed that they had \"accidentally\" added $100 to my bill. Wtf?!  I brought it to their attention, and thy refunded me without apology. Bad food. Bad service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After finding some white, fuzzy stuff that looked like mold on my dumplings, I called the restaurant. I was told there was nothing that could be done and did not even get an apology. I will not be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The first time was good but the 2nd time was my LAST.  Last friday, on 3/2, I ate lunch here and suffered from food poisoning.  The pork fried rice ruined my entire evening.  It was CIAA weekend and I never used so many public restrooms before.  I had diarrhea the entire night.  I truly believe the pork was spoiled but they cooked it anyway and tried to cover up the rotten smell by flavoring the rice.  I plan to file a report to the health department.  Service was great and ambiance was decent too but the food was old."}
{"text":"Chinese food is one of those things that you don't eat a lot, and when you do, you look forward to it. I was extremely disappointed in what I ordered. A co-worker had suggested this place so I was curious to try it out. I ordered the sesame chicken, and general tso for my S/O, along with a side of spring rolls and crab rangoon. My dish had absolutely no flavor to it, there wasn't even really a sauce to it and definitely not crispy. My S/O dish also had no flavor, not spicy like usual. The spring rolls were mediocre (that's being generous) and the rangoons just had no flavor whatsoever.   Perhaps a different cook was here today, I'm not quite sure...and maybe their other dishes are better, but I won't be taking that gamble after this experience, especially considering the price (sesame chicken with brown rice, General tso side of fried rice, 3 springs rolls, order of crab rangoons and 2 20oz sprites = $42.77). I would've given this 0 stars if that was an option.   My suggestion, eat in if you decide to go here so that if its not to your desired liking, you can send it back..."}
{"text":"Good lunch place... seems to get people in and out and can sometimes get pretty crowded if you don't get there at the right time.  I like the General Chicken, but usually get the spicy eggplant dish.  Staff is usually friendly... depending on how busy it gets, but I can relate to being busy and trying to get through a lunch crowd."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  This is my sister's go-to resto for Chinese in Charlotte, and I can see why: House of Leng's serves tasty rice and lo mein dishes, as well as fantastically crispy and flavorful chicken wings, and it's next door to her favorite nail salon.  Whenever we get a mani/pedi, which we almost always do when I fly in for a visit, we usually do take-out at HoL before heading back to her home.  I'd probably rate today's visit 3- or 3.5 stars had my take-out order not taken more than the eight minutes I was told it would take for the wings to cook, which the guy even apologized would be the reason I'd have to wait a bit, and had I received the shrimp lo mein entree (for Mom) I'd asked for, rather than the shrimp lo mein combo that Mom found after we'd already arrived home.  (Btw, the wait for the order was around 25 minutes.)  Still, Mom and sis enjoyed the meal (the eggroll looked so delicious and had a very delectable-sounding crunch!), so three stars will do.  However, I wished I didn't have to suffer the blame for HoL staff getting the order wrong..."}
{"text":"I like the quality of the dumplings here.  Also plenty of vegetables in the Lomein even the meat based ones.  The prices are higher than average but the food portion and quality is on paar."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food in Charlotte. The crispy scallion chicken is absolutely the BEST EVER!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the House of Leng for over 8 years now and I have to say that it is one of the Best places for fast Chinese food. Its hot fast service and exactly the way you order it - the staff is fantastic and courteous I definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"The food is awful and the servers are rude! If you ask a question about the menu item, they frown at your face! This place is 5 minutes from my house but I would never go back!!"}
{"text":"i tend to lean more for japanese food but if i do want something in this spectrum this is where i would go. Ive eaten here often and do enjoy there chicken fried rice as well as there lo meins and beef fried rice. My wife loves the orange chicken and no one ive ever taken here has not left happy. great place"}
{"text":"The food was Fantastic!  It is so hard to find great take out in this area of Charlotte.  I ordered Chicken Chow Fun.  Large portions, great flavor and very nice ladies at the front.  I can't wait to try another item on the menu."}
{"text":"Owner was extremely rude when we spent over 100.00 in there and had to return wonton soup with undercooked noodles. She had the nerve to ask for the complimentary soup noodles back. Hateful woman! I guess she didn't take the class on southern hospitality and could care less that we picked her place on my sisters recommendation since we are in town from Ohio. There are a lot of similar restaurants and I would pass on this one because of the service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We were treated very badly just becuse we came in at 9pm and they closed at 10pm. While we were eating they started putting the chairs on the tables at 915pm wtf? They refused to seat anyone  else until one other couple stated that the sign said 10pm. The wait staff was too young and immature. All wearing street clothes, no aprons or mathing shirts. The female night manger/owner is a nightmare .STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Didn't know this was the original. Did you know this House of Leng was the original House of Leng? I think I even met Leng himself. I don't know. I think it was him. So, I asked him, \"is this the original House of Leng?\" And he said yes it was.  Okay, so if you're not following my rant, there's another House of Leng not so far away near Boardwalk Billy's at University Pointe. I remember the first time I had the Crispy Scallion chicken there. It was awesome. So when my wife and I went to the one at Arbors on Mallard Creek Church Road, we were sure they would be the copy and the Crispy Scallion chicken would be less... awesome. But it was! We also enjoy ordering the Veggie Lo Mein. The two and the two of us met often.  And now we know how they Crispy Scallion chicken and the Veggie Lo Mein at both Houses of Leng are so good. It's made by the same guy. Or at least the same recipe. He often moves from one location to the other. In fact, some of the hall managers also switch locations. I guess it's a family run business. In any case, we had no problems with the food and just full stomachs. Ya, I'm a fan. Thanks, Mr. Leng. Or whoever he was."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese joint! You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This was just a quick stop for take out on my lunch break.  It is within walking distance of my office, so it is very convenient.  I ordered plain lo mein with onions ($1 extra) and extra sauce.  They were a little busy being it was lunchtime, so the service was just ok.  They made my food very quickly, which was a plus, and it was a good portion size for the price (small).  I wouldn't recommend anything larger, it was PLENTY.  It was good!   I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend to anyone for a good, inexpensive, quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I order Sa cha chicken with no onions 95% of the time I'm here. It's consistent and the dinner portion size is easily enough for 3 people. This restaurant is a well oiled machine. The service is always quick and the people are friendly. My vegetables taste fresh and crunchy. I have no complaints. If you want your money to go further, get the Sa cha chicken with only broccoli or without vegetables. They still give you a full container of chicken."}
{"text":"Always great food, attentive service, they know what my son wants from memory.   Customer for six years."}
{"text":"2nd time going to House of Leng and today was trash. Food literally has no seasoning and I'm putting duck sauce on everything. There is no interaction really when you place your order and I just didn't feel like I mattered as a customer just another number in and out."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with everything about this place. When you walk in, it is a small, quant place. But still big enough to fit our party of 12.  The portion sizes were awesome - and our server went the extra mile to make sure that our food was made to our liking (chopped into tiny pieces and blended together). We had an amazing all vegetarian dish, and they even had eggplant. We also tried the chicken wings, both fried and steamed rice, the scallion pancakes, and a few chicken dishes. My husband ordered the egg drop soup and was loving it as well.  All in all, the service, the prices, the food temperature, the TASTE (OMG it was SO good), everything met my 5 star expectations. Now, if only I could move this place to Chattanooga so I can have it more often."}
{"text":"Amazing food at amazing price! Service was very fast! Some of the best Chinese food I've had in the US"}
{"text":"I really don't ever eat Chinese food but we had a client lunch in the area so a co-worker and I decided to check this place out.  It was a casual/cafe type environment...it was clean, bright and packed with business professionals on their lunch hour.  Typically I picture take-out chinese to be rather grimy, dingy and where everything basically tastes like baked salt.  But, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and atmosphere especially since the prices were right!  You expect \"high end\" chinese to come in the form of a PF Changs but I'll tell you what...House of Leng was holding its own!!  The service was good, friendly and the food came out fast (not always a positive but my expectations were realistic).  I ordered the broccoli and chicken meal, with steamed white rice and it came with a springroll.  Everything was very tasty.  I won't say the sodium wasn't alive and well but the overall dish had great flavor and it was a nice portion.  It was even presented nicely on the plate.  The broccoli was fresh and bright green and the rice was nicely stacked on the plate.  The brown sauce the chicken and broccoli came in was thicker than \"normal\" so it was a pretty rich flavor.  The springroll was pretty basic...fried cabbage more or less.  It didn't have any other vegetables in it so it didn't make or break my experience.  Overall...I would say this place is a nice hidden gem.  It will certainly satisfy any chinese-food craving and exceed your expectations if you are not a typical \"take-out\" person."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant around. The best pork lo mein! I eat here once every 1-2 weeks. I haven't tried anything bad on the menu, everything is very delicious."}
{"text":"House of Leng is the 2nd best Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at. Im not a huge Chinese food expert but my family has been going here and the old House of Taipei for years and we have yet to find anything better in Charlotte so it's definitely worth a shot for anyone who hasn't been.  Our favorite dish is the Sa-Cha chicken, we get at least one order of it every time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and food   My gut instinct  told me not to come here , but  since I was somewhat close to home and didn't want to drive to my favorite spot in Mooresville  , I decided to grab a bite to eat .   I ordered  a couple of dishes .. but the dish that forces me to write this review is their \"Honey Walnut Shrimp \" . My mom loves  the lightly battered shrimp coated with a creamy honey sauce and tossed with walnuts  which is how MOST  restaurants prepare this dish ( google Honey walnut shrimp and see for yourself ) .  Anywho back to this disaster I  received . This restaurant has the most DISGUSTING excuse for HWS and also has an incomplete description of the dish on the menu . Picked up my takeout and drove home , once my mother opened her dish , she sees soggy shrimp tossed in a bright orange/ red sauce with broccoli and red peppers and not a walnut in sight ...  think sweet and sour  shrimp , got me .. yeaa ewww . Definitely wasn't expecting that , so I call the restaurant back and explain  how the dish I have has red peppers in it and  no walnuts . The young male advised \"the back probably cooked the wrong dish and to bring it back\". I'm frustrated and starving since now  I have to hold off eating my food and  head back  but  I was also relieved  , like whew ! they made a mistake .. no way the \"from a can\" sweet Mumbo  sauce looking soggy shrimp with red peppers could be HWS. Boy was I wrong .. according to the super rude  , no sense of customer service   female Owner/night manager , this was the correct dish . She informed me that this was their  honey walnut shrimp , they just forgot to give me the  walnuts . No sorry or nada !  I inquired why does the dish have red peppers and the menu doesn't include this ? We don't eat red peppers and would not have ordered this dish otherwise ( points to menu description  that says (Lightly battered shrimp stir fried and topped with honey walnuts along with broccoli ). She had no response, and refused to refund me my 15$ dollars for the untouched food . After requesting 2x  for a refund ,  she  offered to make  another dish . At this point the whole experience  was just  leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Seemed like asking her for my money back was the equivalent of her giving me her arms and legs......lol ..  as a previous reviewer wrote  .. the customer service here is TERRIBLE..  Should have listened to my gut and not have  stopped at this place . Ultimately I picked something that nobody wanted to eat to just get out of the place  and received the difference of the price back . She never apologized  during the entire transaction . On a positive note though , she didn't have to give up  any limbs for  the refunded $ difference ."}
{"text":"I'm at a crossroad with this place. I really like House of Leng, but they also seem to lack consistency.   At dinner time, sometimes the food is good, sometimes its so so.   Lunch  though is the opposite. Lunch is always good from my experience. The chicken and string beans, great asparagus, always excellent. Today is no exception.   But why is dinner so inconsistent?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places in Charlotte. Both locations are pretty good. We usually drive about 20 minutes passing a ton of other places just to order here. The fried rice can be hit or miss - sometimes the rice is undercooked which is always a disappointment. Other than that, the flavor is great and quality is usually in point."}
