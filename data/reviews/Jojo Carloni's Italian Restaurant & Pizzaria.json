{"text":"First visit here and it was amazing!  Great service, great rolls, soup everything. Between our table we had lasagna, Mac and cheese, penne and rigatoni. No complaints. Thanks for handling a larger group with ease."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would.  Absolutely the best..... Anywhere.  You will not be disappointed.  Priced right and the quality of food and service is unmatched."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT
Expect to be treated like family and eat like you were in mama's kitchen!
John does some fabulous cooking!"}
{"text":"Best Italian place I've ever been to. It's a charming, family owned restaurant that serves the most delicious Italian cuisine and pizza. Nearly everyone I know in Olmsted Falls has had JoJo's and loved it. 

I've been to JoJo's COUNTLESS times, and the great atmosphere and the astounding food never cease to disappoint."}
{"text":"Found Jo Jo's on day 3 of them serving lunch. Great little place.  The pizza was excellent, and even though I think I misspoke when ordering , the owner,John, remade the pizza the way I wanted. That's customer service the way it should be!!I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight.   Absolutely awesome.  Homemade rolls are 5 stars all by themselves.  Great pizza.   Everything was authentic Italian.  Unlike many chains.  Tomatoes are even flow in from Italy.  5 star lasagna.   Will make this a regular stop for when we want Italian entrees or fabulous pizza."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Took 5 minutes to be acknowledged. Even then, the owner just yelled through the takeout window that we could seat ourselves. Waited another 10 minutes while the waitresses and other staff completely ignored us. It was another 5 minutes before we got menus, another 10 before the waitress took our order. My boyfriend sent his flat Pepsi back twice. He finally asked for water but the waitress went on to serve a bottle of wine to another table and never brought the water.  We had to ask the owner for it, as he stopped at the next table to chat with his friends, who by the way, arrived 20 minutes after us and got their food before us. The salad was some lettuce, a grape tomato, two thin cucumber slices and a pile of thinly shaved carrots. And they forgot to add the cheese we requested.  The spaghetti was bland. The meat in the sauce tasted like cardboard. Furthest thing from authentic I've ever had. Finally, the waitress offered us free dessert because of the poor service. We got the chocolate cake and cheesecake to go. (We had already spent almost 2 hours there.) So glad we didn't pay for the dessert. They were both bitter and the taste was inconsistent throughout. By the way,  $8 for a slice of cake? It wasn't worth a dollar.  We'll never return."}
{"text":"OMG fabulous!  Truly one of the best meals we've ever had. Impeccable service and great food at a great price - how can you go wrong?  The calamari was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. Everything tasted fresh and homemade, perfectly seasoned and the portions are more than generous."}
{"text":"Love this place!! They have the best pizza. We especially love the stuffed pepper pizza. We had friends over from Sheffield for dinner and served them the stuffed pepper pizza a few months ago, and the other day they stopped by after driving all the way over to pick on up the liked it so much."}
{"text":"Go to JoJo's !

First time,eat in and had what may be the best pepperoni ,black olive ,and red onion  PIZZA I have had in 45 years of eating pizza.

Great service,will go back for a traditional meal for sure."}
{"text":"From when you first walk in the door, you feel like your attending a family meal. John is a down the earth guy passionate about his restaurant. The food is awesome and the ambiance is authentic Italian."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very friendly service, excellent food, and reasonable prices! So far, I've only tried the pizza but I always hear people rave about the rest of the menu as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! 
Awesome Italian food.
The bread was warm and soft, the special homemade butter made me want more bread. I usually try not to \"bread out,\" to save room for later but even I couldn't resist. I wish I had tried the hot cocoa. 
They were showing football on the big flat screen tv on the wall. 
The clam chowder soup had wonderful flavor and texture, the caprese salad had huge fresh basil leaves and one leaf for each tomato/mozzarella, which was also a huge piece of cheese. Many other restaurants skimp here and Jojo's did not. 
The calamari was a little tough for me but my wife liked it, and I  didn't see any tentacles, which are my favorite part. 
My pasta carbonara was fantastic, not to oily like at other restaurants. I was already full by this time but loved the pistachio gelato dessert and got take-out homemade cannoli, which was a gigantic piece. 
My wife did not like that her water was not refilled. -1 star for service.
I highly recommend this restaurant!
We met the owner who was gracious and his wife and 2 children who work there; they were sitting down to have dinner at their own place, what better recommendation?
This is my first review ever, just because I thought the food was really great, especially because I love Italian food. 
I would much rather support a family-owned local business than a huge generic chain restaurant any day. 
They were also open Sunday, which is a huge plus.
I can't wait to try their deep dish seafood pizza...and seafood pasta...and homemade ice cream coffee cake.
The owners seem to really care about fresh ingredients and that unbeatable homemade food experience. 
I can't wait to go back even though I'm still full from just having eaten there.
Kids eat free on Thursdays, which is great to encourage families to come out.
They cater as well, which I will use them for work and private parties.
Happy 2 year anniversary soon and hope for many more to come!"}
{"text":"Delicious !! . I had the Penne Vodka with Italian sausage, my son had the chicken parmesan. Both were fantastic The Italian wedding soup was seasoned perfectly and if we weren't in a food coma after that we ordered the Chocolate mousse and Tirmasu - both were delicious and homemade. We will definitely make a reservation nexttime . It is a small restaurant- but was worth waiting for a table.

So nice to have a great restaurant so close to home.   Everyone was very nice and welcoming.  We will definately be back.  Oh, and on Thursdays, kids 12 and under eat free with the purchase of an adult entree."}
{"text":"Amazing veal Marsala & clam linguine.  Homemade shrimp bisque to die for!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best quality Italian food in the area! Best pizza in Cleveland! Great homemade crust!"}
{"text":"After moving to Olmsted Township last week, we were looking at our dining options in the are?  We noticed Jo Jo Carloni's on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  We were slightly surprised at the small size of the dining room, but were seated right away.  The server was very welcoming and the menu looked to have a great variety of food.  I had the homemade meat filled ravioli, and my partner had the lasagna.   We ended our meal with tiramisu.  We ordered two cannoli to go.  We had a wonderful meal and experience. We enjoyed it so much, we went back the next night to try their pizza.  Another great dining experience.  Definitely a local favorite."}
{"text":"We do not live nearby but would drive the hour for some great Italian food! This place is family owned and operated and is delicious! We had spicy pickle appetizer, shared an antipasto salad and pizza! The food and hospitality cannot be beat! 

Pizza is delicious, I wish it was closer so we could enjoy more."}
{"text":"Jo Jo Carloni's is pretty much everything you think of when it comes to an Italian eatery in America. The feel of being in mama's kitchen is very much with you as soon as you are seated. The checkered tablecloth, the candle set into the top of the wine bottle center of the table, the pictures of Italy along the wall. It's all there.

I had the Italian mac n cheese, because why break from a good thing right? I had had it at Matteo's previously and felt like comparing. It was so very good but I have to say that the version I had at Matteo's was far superior. Our kids ordered lasagna and spaghetti and each of them loved their meals. 

It was our daughters birthday and the server overheard us chatting about it. As all good Italian mamas would do they brought her a cannoli with a birthday candle in it. She was thrilled as she was so touched by their kindness and absolutely loves cannoli! The cream inside was to die for! True rich sweet mascarpone with mini chocolate chips inside. Yum! 

We will definitely be back for more of their delicious dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Family owned local joint and it's fantastic. There's only a few tables so be prepared to wait a bit for a seat but the food is excellent, service is great and personal. The owner also talks at the kids' schools and does a lot for the community. A+"}
{"text":"Hey Berea!  These's a real authentic home made Italian restaurant not 10 mins from 237!

Three generations making everything from scratch every day.  Pastas, meat dishes, pizzas, wings soups, salads, wine & beer.

Extremely reasonable, owners are very personal and they've got Dean, Dino and Tony playing all the time.

Finally, real Italian food close to Berea that's not a highway chain."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends on June 18, 2015.  The food was excellent!  Being Italian, I am pretty hard to please when eating out; I often order eggplant parm anytime I eat out at an Italian restaurant; the entree arrived piping hot and delicious.  The place is small and quaint but the atmosphere friendly, the pizzas look amazing!  We are planning to return.  Joe came out of the kitchen; was friendly and very funny.  We enjoyed our entire experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and went for dinner last night. Great little (and I mean little) place. Call for reservations if you don't want to wait. The owner and his wife were there working tables. Our waitress was exceptionally nice. I got Meatlovers Rigatoni and my wife got Chicken Marsala. Fantastic! The garlic bread was out of this world. I brought home leftovers for two days. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Just got back from a nice birthday dinner at JoJo's Italian Restaurant in Olmsted Falls.

Excellent pizza, attentive wait staff and an owner who personally stops at every table to be sure everything meets their customer's expectations.

We started out with complimentary rolls and olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. I'm not a big fan of bread and rolls with my meal but I really enjoyed their presentation. We enjoyed a deep-dish pizza that was piping hot, with plenty of cheese and toppings.

It was nice to take a break from the chain restaurants and enjoy the intimate atmosphere of this family-run eatery."}
{"text":"Love this little gem! I have never eaten inside because it is a very tiny space, but this is the best place for pizza and Italian carryout in the area. Great staff, great food, the few times we had issues the management/owners took care of it right away. No one is perfect, but JoJo's makes it right every time. 

They make everything homemade so it does take a little longer, but it is beyond worth it. Everything we have ordered from here has been delicious."}
{"text":"My second time here and a little disappointed from the first time. They seemed to be out of everything, but not really. Waitress said they were out of lettuce, but then they weren't. Told us they were out of all pizza sizes except xl and 1/2 sheet, but then the girl helping customers at the window said they had small. My boyfriend wanted to try a pizza so a small is what we wanted, but had to pay an arm and a leg for xl. They also put olives on the pizza which we asked not to be. My eggplant was ok, very cheesy, not the best I've had as this is my go to Italian dish. Rick got the penne vodka and he said it was good, but didn't taste like it did when I ordered it our first visit. The pizza he took home was not the best either especially for the price."}
{"text":"Really disappointing visit the other day.  Food wasn't exactly \"authentic\" as advertised - was about as authentic Italian as Taco Bell is Mexican.  Would've actually enjoyed more if the owner wasn't such a pompous-ass.  Am guessing he knows his food is that of an amateur, and needs to take it out on his customers.  Such a shame."}
{"text":"Recently discovered that this spot is now offering lunch service, so went with a few work colleagues to give them a try.  Wanting to try a number of dishes, I convinced one of them to order multiple dishes and go share-sies.  We settled on chicken Parmesan (my favorite \"staple\" Italian dish), a meatball sub and I also decided to try their pizza (available by the slice).

Our server took our drink orders and quickly brought out an order of their garlic rolls with an oil and red wine vinegar dip.  The garlic rolls were warm and delicious.

By ordering the chicken parm we also got a side salad.  It was a standard salad (iceberg lettuce, tomato, carrot, shredded cheese) with their house dressing (Italian, which was light but flavorful) and was pretty filling.  Then out came the main dishes.

The single pizza slice had an unusual pepperoni arrangement and the crust was on the doughy side for my taste.

The chicken Parmesan had a rich sauce and nice cheese ratio to go along with the pasta.  Their sauce is hard to explain...not really sweet and not overly vinegary either, more like \"rich\" (maybe made with veal stock or something?).  It was not my favorite style of sauce...not really bad per se, just not a taste I care for.

The meatball sub bread was crispy and the meat seemed more like ground chunks than actual meatballs, with the same sauce described above in the chicken parm dish.

We were well taken care of and had a nice chat with the owner as well ( a very personable guy!).  Reasonable priced for lunch, a good choice for the area."}
{"text":"Love their pizza; however the young girl answering the phone is rude and acts as if she is doing you a favor by taking your carry-out order. I asked her a question and she dropped the phone on the counter and yelled for her mother to answer the question. Obviously the owner's daughter- that explains it all."}
{"text":"First time here even though we used to live behind this place. Small, but cozy. Food came out promptly. The garlic Parmesan chicken wings were excellent. Nice and crispy. The Italian Wedding Soup was the best we ever had. Eggplant rollatini is very good and pizza is delicious. Nice intimate place!  Wine and beer served also."}
{"text":"Just as great on our second visit. I got a little adventurous with my pizza selection this time and got the abiatta which had kalamata olives, Italian sausage, banana peppers, laid out on pesto sauce on pan style crust. My wife had the eggplant parmesan which comes out on two plates. The portion is huge! We felt bad for our server. They were really busy and she had some very pushy and rude customers. We took our desert to go so they could fill a table. It's a small dining room and they get a lot of return business. Their canolli is fantastic! Very rich, and fresh, because like everything else it's made in house from scratch.  We will be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Took my wife and son to the new and improved JoJo's.  The food is great! Had perch and home made perrogies that were delicious! The pizza my wife had was excellent also. The new owners are doing a great job! Keep up the good work. We recommend this to anyone looking for great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"Love everything about about the place.  Food is out of this word.  Owners are awesome and friendly. Only bad thing is way to small!! 

They need to go to the old #1 Buffet on Lorain and Sterns.  Better location hi traffic ten times the space and parking out the wazoo."}
{"text":"South Beach Bake is the best of Italy without the pasta!  Great service. Chicken JoJo is a winner as well. Watch for them in their new location April 2018 - 627 W Bagley Rd in Berea"}
{"text":"Meh - fairly average. Had take out, pizza was very unremarkable, cheesy garlic bread was terrible, and wings were surprisingly decent, for a pizza place. There are better options nearby, like Angelina's or Barbarinos."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.   My wife and I love the Vodka Penne.  Great atmosphere and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"2nd visit was not a favorable one. Danielle wasn't really happy with her Eggplant Parm. My Penne Vodka tasted fine - good even but lacked the kick that Danielle's dish had the first time we went, though i got mine with shrimp and she hadn't. maybe the sauce on hers was different as a result.
We were also told that it was \"Saturday Night\" so they'd run out of things... regular lettuce (for salads that come with dinners), the soup of the day was gone and we were also told they were out of small and large pizzas but we could order an extra large or a 1/2 sheet. how do you run out of a pizza size? it' starts with dough. you just use less dough, right? 
I wanted to try their pizza as I'd been told it was great. so, unfortunately, i ordered an extra large Pizza Arabiatta - their signature pizza - to go. I'd asked for no kalamata olives and got them all over the pizza anyway. the pizza is supposed to be spicy and even has a fiery graphic next to it on their menu to let you know, but it wasn't in the least. in fact, i couldn't taste the sauce at all. all that is fine. shit happens but the thing was $22. 
maybe they were out of the smaller sizes because they'd messed up other people's orders earlier and had to redo them. who knows? long and the short of it is, i'm in no hurry to ever buy pizza here again and I guess if I go back for dinner I'll do it on a Friday and cross my fingers that they aren't running out of anything because \"it's Friday, you know?\""}
{"text":"My family has been looking for a yummy local Italian place and this restaurant definitely takes the flourless chocolate cake! 

I definitely recommend making a reservation for dinner, especially on the weekend. This location is quite small but I learned that they are moving to a new, larger location due to their success (and they deserve it!!)

The staff here is a group of the friendliest, most caring people I've experienced while dining in a long time! Our server was fantastic: she was attentive, super sweet, and helpful. I also saw both the owner and the chef going around to check up on tables to make sure they were having a good time. 

The food is also delicious, rich, and plentiful. My family ordered two appetizers: the fried mozzarella balls and the bruschetta. Both exceeded our expectations. Every single entree we ordered was on point. The entrees come with soup or salad and delicious warm, fresh garlic rolls. You can tell while you're eating the food that there's a bunch of love baked into every bite! Afterwords, we had cannoli and tiramisu - both of which were also amazing. 

The price point for quality and portion size is unbeatable. Their reasonable prices, amazing service, and stellar food options will definitely guarantee that I will be a repeat costumer. I can't wait to see how they expand into the new location!"}
{"text":"This is a benchmark for tastes of Italian cuisine in the area. The Italian wedding soup is the best. I followed with a perfectly prepared veal Marsala and finally tiramisu. I would like to thank the wonderful family who own and operate this fine establishment your love for what you do is in every dish!"}
{"text":"We got to go service twice the first time they called us 4 times to confirm the order and when we picked it up gave the cashier a 2 dollar it and as we were walking out they made a smart as remark. Then the second time we ordered a 16 ounce soup when we got home  it was 12 ounces and the pizza was wrong. This is an Italian restaurant what's up. When we called it was the owners daughter  working the phones."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The owners are always walking around and get to know you by your first name. This place is tucked into a Plaza, but is the best Italian food around. The mozzarella balls for an app are my favorite! All the entrees are huge portions and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I recently had Jo Jo cater my Christmas Eve party. When I picked up the food the staff was very friendly and appreciative of the business. The food was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and I got a lot of good feedback from my guests. Reasonably priced and tasty food. What's not to love! I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a restaurant. 
Friendly, owner operated , clean, great meal,good price. Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't know how I've never heard of this place. Was working today and my boss mentioned this place and said it had really good food. I needed a chicken parmesan and decided to try this place. This place is yummy. I ordered the chicken parm and my friend ordered a pizza. My friend said her pizza was very good and my parm was delicious. The balsamic and oil they served with their bread was so good I had to ask the server where they got the balsamic vinegar and she said it was housemade. The pasta that came with my dinner was flavorful. Some places tend to ignore the pasta side and it's usually bland, but the spaghetti sauce was flavorful. The chef came to our table and asked about our dinner which is always a nice touch and our server was great too."}
{"text":"Love the family, love the food. True authentic Italian! My husband and I eat there at least once a week, it's just like home cooking. Thank you for great service every time!!"}
{"text":"We live in Olmsted Township and eat here once a week!  The owners are friendly and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Guess I didn't realize it was upscale Italian prices. Prices high for portion size ..just like Brio, but without the classy ambiance.  Ended up w/ Pizza since we didn't want to drop 18-20 each on entrees. 
Pizza was just normal. Nothing stood out, about as plain as possible. Ave amount of sauce & cheese and crust was normal. $13 for Lg cheese. Specialties were over 20. 
$8 for 2 Stuffed Eggplants (app'r) which was good. Kids meal $6 for pasta + meatball.  Rolls were complimentary but just ok.  Decor was pretty plain but nice & new. Server was nice & very attentive!  But long gap btwn app delivery & entree, pushing 25 mins.  Overall JoJo was just Average Jo."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was top notch. First we tried the Mozarella Balls, which are handmade on site. Then I had a house salad and garlic bread, which taste wonderful.  Finally for the entree (we were already quite full!), I had Penne Vodka with shrimp, which has a fantastic sauce and finely cooked shrimp placed on top. My girlfriend tried the Fettuccine Alfredo and loved it as well! They also have a great beer and wine selection, and the atmosphere is calming, relaxing, and cozy. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Happened to find this little gem in a small shopping plaza in Olmsted Falls. The place is small, and also does food carry outs, including pizza. There are only about 6-8 tables in the restaurant. The ambiance wasn't fancy by any means. The food makes up for any lack of atmosphere however. The Alfredo sauce was so creamy and plentiful. My chicken parmigiana was tasty and the portions were huge. My husband enjoyed the baked manicotti as well. We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was really a pleasant surprise. The owner greeted us at the door and everyone was very friendly. The dining room is small but the food and service were top notch, way above what we were expecting. 

Everything we had was expertly prepared.  Every dish tasted exceptionally fresh and flavorful without being overly sugary or salty. The meat lover's pizza was delicious as was my wife's fresh perch and pierogi dinner. Even the cole slaw was homemade and you could really taste the difference. 

Dinner cost a little more than your average pizza place but it was way above your average shopping plaza Italian food. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I placed a large to go order and when I picked it up I had my 3 yr old with me. The owner helped me carry everything out and put it in my car. They also accommodated a different salad choice for a family style dinner. Everything tasted AWESOME!  Thanks again, and can't wait to come in for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here based on yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Had garlic bread with cheese, Mac and cheese with shrimp, and pepperoni & sausage pizza. All of the food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the Italian wedding soup, which was divine, along with a slice of pepperoni pizza. Small place so I imagine getting a table during busy goes could be tough. We breezed in and out because we came very early for lunch. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The rolls are absolutely heavenly. Generous portions of great marinara sauce with your choice of pasta. Amazing pizza. Can't wait to go back again and try something new on a fantastic menu with choices galore!"}
{"text":"Again, a wonderful meal!  The service was great and the food came out HOT!  Love it!  Most restaurants food comes out luke warm,  but not here!"}
{"text":"Good pizzas, lacked EVERYWHERE else.

Came in here with my fiancé to check it out. 

We sat at the bar and the service was slow and poor. I ordered a glass of wine and my fiancé a cocktail and I felt like we waited forever to receive it. The bartenders just  moved so slowly and had no real urgency for anyone or anything.

My fiancé and I ordered a couple different items to try the menu. I started with a house salad, and him - the house made wedding soup. Both were great. We then shared a seafood deluxe pizza, and eggplant Parmesan.

After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, the food finally arrived. The pizza was perfect. I give JoJos credit here. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, amazing all around. 

The eggplant looked and tasted like vomit on a plate. Gritty, lacking flavors, it was so disgusting. My fiancé tried to be polite about it, but it was truly horrible. 

The sun eventually started to blind us, and we were baking under the hot windows. Poor architectural design. 

At one point the owner, John, came over to chat with us. I just have to laugh out loud at his terrible excuses for our poor experience: 
He blamed his bartenders (I'm a bartender- not cool dude. They were trying, just slow)
He blamed his kitchen.
He blamed the contractor.
He blamed whoever he could.

At one point he said to me \" this place would be perfect except for my staff\"

Ummm okay? This place is only happening BECAUSE of your staff. The people YOU hired. Again, I'm in the industry and take insult to the discredit he gave his own employees. My fiancé and I left with a \"wtf just happened\" feeling. My fiancé  actually said to me: \"that dude is an A hole\"

Not worth returning, but I may order the seafood deluxe pizza for takeout."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place!  Food was delicious and the staff was great.  They squeezed us in without a reservation and it was worth it!!!  Can't wait to come back and try something else.  

It's nice to find a nice hard working family owned business!  Great job"}
{"text":"2015/05/09 
Came back 1 week after our initial visit. 
John and crew did not disappoint. 
They had perch this time, something I can't find in SF. 
REALLY GOOD. Nicely breaded and although fried, not at all greasy. 
Pierogi at an Italian place?!? Don't even question it. 
They're good. I over heard a conversation John had with another table. 
I'm sure he'll share the pierogi and pizza connection with you. 

We got the large thin crust seafood pizza with garlic butter sauce. 
Care was taken when topping the pie. Each slice in perfect symmetry. 

Finally, the cannoli. Crunchy shell, prepared to order and not cloyingly sweet. 

Our glasses were constantly being filled. 
Since we a drought in California, you actually need to ask for water. 

Jojo's don't change a thing! Everything is perfect. 

We will be back when we're back in the North Coast. 

Went to Jojo's for their perch and pierogi. No such luck since they were out of perch. But they had pierogi. 
It's basically impossible to find them in San Francisco. 
You have to settle for the frozen commercial variety. 
The pierogi are nothing like that here. They are incredibly good. 

The calamari were really good too. Crunchy, then soft and tender. Not chewy. 
Our dish was clean. Nothing left. 

The pizza, seafood with a special request for butter garlic sauce. 
That was on point too. 

The cannoli are filled to order. No soggy shells here. 
Not too sweet either. 

Wish we have a Jojo's in San Francisco. 

Family run, the crew really nice and friendly. 
Real cloth red check table cloth, changed for each sitting!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. We've tried several different entrees and pizzas. We've enjoyed them all. My favorite is the Penne Vodka Pasta. My sons favorite is the deep dish pizza. The pizza looks like a work of art! Entrees come with Jo Jo's homemade bread. The bread is amazing!

The staff has always been nice with excellent service."}
{"text":"A little expensive but pretty good food. Stuffed banana peppers were amazing! Salad was average. Margherita pizza not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Went with friends for my birthday.  We all had different entrees and all were excellent!  Portions are generous, and everything is handmade and homemade daily. Prices are very reasonable.  The owner came out to every table to make sure that everything was good.  We were full but couldn't resist sharing the lemon cheesecake--not to be missed!  We all said it would be worth another trip.  Fabulous meal!"}
{"text":"True hole in the wall, but such a hidden gem!  The pizza is really good, and the staff was very nice. 

I can't want to take friends and family. I also found out they deliver!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My fave local destination for authentic Italian cuisine. The dining room is small but intimate. Portions are generous so anticipate taking leftovers home with you (but leftovers that you'll actually eat!). I gave gift cards to my neighbors last summer after they helped me with some storm damage at my home and they loved the place, too!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and being a new resident to Olmsted Falls I had to check this place out. My girlfriend and I went there last night and this place did not disappoint. Hands down the best pizza and wings in Olmsted Falls! On our way out we met the owner and it turns out that his mom was my Sunday School teacher when I was a kid (small world). 
The only reason for 4/5 stars was our server could use some training. She was a little inattentive, but we did get there close to closing time, and I think she may have been new; I give her a week and she will be an All-Star.
All said and done, I can guarantee we will be headed back!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a negative review after eagerly anticipating the amazing food I read about in all these other reviews.  We have tried to eat here two times recently since they opened in Berea.  I love Italian food.  The first time we arrived around 5:45 on a Friday.  Close to busy but not quite.  There were open tables everywhere and they could not seat our party of 4 for over an hour due to reservations.  This was after the hostess debated for 10 minutes if there was space or not.  We chalked it up to needing reservations even though they appeared unorganized, and we left to try again.  We tried with reservations and we were told as long as we arrived on time for our 5:45 time we could have the space because they had another party at 7:15.  We arrived on time if not early.  They sat another group in our table and told us we had to wait for another group to finish.  They didn't know how long.  Mind you there were still empty tables in the restaurant.  The collection of hostesses also seem to ignore you once they realize they can't seat you.  We left again.  Not sure we will try the unorganized mess again."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant I've ever ate at. You can close your eyes and pick anything. Seafood pizza, veal Marsala was great."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service!  We love everything about this place...from the cozy atmosphere to the wonderful staff and of course, the great food!  Since the dining room is small, I would recommend making a reservation (they are very accommodating)."}
{"text":"Love the place and they make you feel like you are part of their family.  Great food great service.  Sincerely the Whole Dailey Family!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to write a review based on a single visit consisting of a pizza and some drinks, but this new place is a steep upgrade from the old JoJo's in Olmsted Township with a full bar, patio, and modern dining room, and for that alone I thought I'd get the word out. 

My girlfriend and I stopped in on a Thursday night to watch some playoff hockey and check out the new place. If I'm being completely honest, I thought we were going to the old place, and first drove to their former location, but I digress... 

To say that I was shocked walking in to see the new digs would be an understatement. It has a classy,  \"upscale\" Italian vibe, but not pretentious at all. 

We ordered their seafood pizza and a selection of cocktails from their comprehensive house cocktail menu. The pizza was delicious and the cocktails exquisite. Pizza starts with it's crust, and JoJo's is up there with some of the greats in that regard. 

I was also able to spend some time taking with the owner, John, and learned that all their Italian dishes are family recipes. I definitely want to stop in again for an actual dinner. I'm always skeptical of Italian restaurants, as I generally see their food as merely pasta and sauce that I could easily duplicate or even surpass at home, but I have a feeling that JoJo's may be the exception to my generalization. 

For now, however, I can only tell you about their bar and the overall atmosphere of the new JoJo's. And while they still have some minor issues to overcome (e.g staring directly into the sun while sitting at the bar inside at sunset) let me tell you, I will be back; soon and often."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, we wanted to try a new place and we thought Jo Jo Carloni might be a casual good Italian place.  We were so impressed!  Reservations are recommended,  as the capacity is small.  The friendliness of the owners and staff was welcoming. With the aromas from the kitchen, we were willing to wait.  A crowd gathered with more incoming diners,  as well as many \"to go\" orders, but it wasn't too long before we were seated.  We tried the mozzarella balls appetizer, which was delicious with 6 large chunks of fried fresh mozzarella.  The salads were very fresh, and the Italian Wedding soup was loaded with mini meatballs.  For entrees, they were all hot and very tasty.  My favorite was the Eggplant Parmesan, although the Meatlover's Rigatoni and Penne Vodka with chicken were delicious.  Portions were large and we enjoyed the leftovers for another meal or two!  As our first time, we sampled the housemade tiramisu and a scoop of spumoni ice cream.  

We were so impressed with the quality of the meals and service.  John told us about plans to move to a larger space in Olmsted Falls soon.  We'll definitely return and follow to a new location.  My family is happy to have found our favorite Italian hang out!"}
{"text":"First off I need to tell you this place is very small inside.  Maybe eight tables. While I was there they were doing a ton of carry-out business thru a dedicated counter.  The food was very good. Great flavor, well prepared, and a outstanding value for the price. 
I had a excellent spicy blackened chicken pasta dish. Ralph had the spaghetti - he was delighted. 
I'm proud to be the first to review JoJo's"}
{"text":"We came, we ate, we'll definitely be back!!

Located in a little strip of stores, at the end. ample  parking.  

Small, cozy, clean.  Only about 8-10 booth/tables.  We got the last available table.  When people left, others came in.

Friendly & attentive staff.  The husband/wife owners are working but make sure to chat with just about everyone eating there!  Super friendly folks that care about serving up a good meal!!

They start you off with garlic butter rolls.  Yum, but I could have used either a little more butter or some marinara dipping sauce(I could have asked for butter as it was not served with it)A little bready, for the brush of garlic butter just on top.

My 15 year old son got the arabiata pizza.  It was delicious!  The only down side was the super strong olives. We didn't care for them as they take over the flavor of the pizza.  All I have to say is, move over all the #1 pizza places in northeast Ohio, there's about to be a new #1 pizza!! No lie!! 

I got the Jo Jo chicken. You have a choice of breaded or grilled.  I got breaded.  It was a nice light breading.  2 tender chicken breasts (had leftovers for lunch the next day that was just as yummy warmed up).  It sat on linguini all in a lemon sauce...delicious!!! 

Then you can't leave without getting a dessert. We shared a cannoli.  It was good and super stuffed!

I couldn't believe it, but I was overjoyed to see they had homemade potato/cheese pierogies!!! We got an order to go and they were very good!

It will take a little longer to get your food then other places, but if you want it made fresh and with care, that's what happens! 

I can't wait to go back to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out JoJo's after reading the other Yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. We had their pizza (which has a wonderful sweet sauce) as well as their wings. They hand bread the wings and make their own sauce and it shows! We will definitely be going back for more! We live in Olmsted Falls and are happy to find a good pizza/wing place in the area. We didn't realize they had a full menu as well and are looking forward to going back and eating from their full menu - I'm sure it will be delicious after everything we tasted this evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the restaurant for the first time over the weekend. We were surprised how small the restaurant is maybe 7 or 8 tables. The food was good, but we felt over priced for a strip plaza restaurant.  We think this place is better suited for take out. Yelps rating of two $$ should be changed to $$$."}
{"text":"This place certainly has the heart of a good restaurant. The atmosphere is typical of a family type Italian restaurant. The staff was friendly and attentive, although they seemed very overwhelmed and disorganized on a busy Friday night. 
We waited about half an hour to sit at a table, ordered a plain cheese pizza and waited about 40 minutes for it to come to the table. I understand pizza places aren't quick service, but they are usually worth the wait for fresh out of the oven pizza. This pizza however was an extreme disappointment. We ordered regular crust( they also offer thin and deep dish) and the crust was unbelievably dry and tasteless. My husband noted that it was actually cracking out of dryness. It seemed as though the crusts were previously pre-baked and then the toppings were added later and then re-baked. This is the opposite of what you expect from a pizza place. The result was a very dry, unimpressive pizza. Cheese and sauce were okay, although the sauce was very very sweet and had way too much mediocre dry Italian seasoning on it, giving it a very cheap flavor. 
We were in the restaurant for nearly two hours total, and left very disappointed in a place that had great potential."}
{"text":"Their specialty is pizza and pasta, but if you are a soup lover like me, you will love Jo Jo's!  Their Bacon Jalapeno Cheddar Soup basically changed my life. I was looking forward to ordering it on my second visit, but they didn't have it =(  I was so disappointed because I planned on having a big bowl of that with their awesome house salad (tons of cheese, awesome dressing) and garlic bread (yeah I know, it's only garlic bread, but not at Jo Jo's!) for dinner.  However, the disappointment did not last for long because instead of the Bacon Jalapeno Cheddar Soup, they were featuring a Spicy Pumpkin & Sausage Soup.  I was skeptical at first because I'm not too keen on pumpkin flavors, but WOW was I impressed!  The creamy pumpkin base was subtle,not overpowering at all!  It paired well with the mild heat from the sausage.  I fell even more in love with the soup when I found out that all of their soups were made from scratch =) They also have a nice selection of craft beers that weren't too expensive either.  A lot of beers from Brooklyn Brewery.  I had the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, which is now my favorite stout....better than Southern Tier's Choklat (which is hard for me to say because I am OBSESSED with Southern Tier Brewery).  Other things to mention are the mozzarella balls (made with fresh mozzarella not previously frozen) and the calamari (the breading is authentic and flavorful).  I just can't find a negative thing to say about this gem.  I guess you will just have to try it out yourself, but I know you'll love it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  We are from the DC area and stopped here on a road trip bc the reviews were so good.  They aren't lying!  It was delicious and the owner was such a cool guy.  He is 1/2 Italian and 1/2 polish so eat the pasta and garlic bread but don't miss the pierogies!!!"}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to this establishment. My coworker and I was in the area working and decided to visit on a week night based on the Yelp reviews. This restaurant is very cozy and welcoming. Chelsea was our waitress and she was very nice and attentive.

I ordered the calamari and my coworker ordered wings as appetizers. For our main meals, I ordered the special - tetrazzini with shrimp instead of chicken. My coworker had the lasagna. Everything was excellent. Chelsea brought out some garlic rolls that were oh so delicious! Both of our meals came with salad. I wasn't able to eat my entire entree. My food was excellent!! I would definitely visit this restaurant if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. If it were not for the word of mouth this place has, I would have never gone. Its very cramped indoors, but the food makes up for it even if it takes a little while longer to get. My pizza was very different and quite good. It is very expensive, keep that in mind."}
{"text":"My husband and I have traveled all over the world, Italy and Sicily included. When we travel we always use yelp to find what we call \"diamonds in the rough\".  We decided after becoming tired of our favorite local restaurants to yelp in our area and found this \"diamond in the rough\".  Based on the reviews we had high expectations. They exceeded our expectations. There were so many wonderful things on the menu we had a hard time deciding but settled on the mozzarella balls and stuffed eggplant as an appetizer.  That could've been our meal. But we didn't stop there.  Our friend ordered the chicken Parmesan, my husband had a thin crust pizza and I got the penne arribiatta. If you want to be transported to Italy/Sicily you must visit this restaurant.  There are only seven tables, they do take reservations, and you will want to go back again and again and again. The owners are charming as is the restaurant and you can see their passion for food and their customers.  Nothing is frozen here. You can taste the freshness in every bite. Everything is made to order. If you have to jump off the highway and drive a few miles to get this place you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Soooo love this place! Great people and the best food ever!! Found this little gem about a month ago and had to come back to celebrate my birthday. I would eat here everyday. Decor is cute, cozy and give you that authentic Italian feel, so even if you aren't Italian, you can pretend for a while. Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to go to a great family owned Italian restaurant ...check this place out!  We've been going there about 3 years now and it keeps getting better.  The owners are hands on with every part of the experience.  And you never walk out of there hungry...it's like going to your cousins house for a family dinner...."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!
Came here last night. Didn't even know this little place existed. 
It's quite small. There are two tables that fit 4 right in the door then there are 5 booths!
That's it. We didn't wait long for our food.
There were two rolls with oil for us to enjoy while we were eating our soup and salad before our meals came out. I didn't eat any because I'm dieting =( but they were devoured. 
I got the chicken alfredo and a sausage and bean soup instead of a salad.
The pasta was cooked perfectly, chicken was great, not tough. 
And there was enough sauce on it, perfect amount.
Some places either overload or not enough. 
I had to take a to go box because I had so much left over.
The place was clean, tables not sticky, staff was great and booths are fluffy people friendly.
The waitress kept our drinks filled, and checked on us. Not a long wait obviously for the food which was great. My dinner was about $16. Kinda pricey, but I had leftovers so worth it.
Can't wait to go again.
I did notice quite a few people coming in and out throughout our trip getting pizza at the window right when you walk in. So obviously their pizza is good. Will have to try that one day."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! My fiance and I get pizza every Saturday and I wanted to try an authentic, local pizzeria. I read good reviews on Yelp and drove to Jojo's from North Olmsted because I am out of delivery range. It was worth it! This is REAL pizza! I plan to come back soon and dine in and try more items."}
{"text":"So excited to find this hidden gem. Great service from everyone that works here. The food is outstanding!  We have tried fettuccine alfredo,  veal parm, penne arabiata, and pizza. Hands down the best Italian  food on the West side."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing.   We even got to meet the chef after ordering the food.   Everyone here is really friendly and homemade.  Even the dessert is homemade.   I will come back here again."}
{"text":"Favorite local restaurant. Have eaten in house and taken food to go and each time I've been impressed with the service and quality of food. The owners are an incredibly nice couple that greet guests with a smile and offer a no-rush comfortable dining environment. I absolutely love the margherita pizza and my wife is a huge fan of the eggplant parm sandwich (not on the menu but they've made it for us twice now). A definite must try if you're on the west side (and also worth the drive)."}
{"text":"Awesome food. It's a tiny place and I've only ordered \"to go\" but I've tried their calzone, chicken parm, chicken marsala, and lamb marsala. I recommend the chicken parm and chicken marsala! For personal taste I preferred the chicken marsala over the lamb even though I usually enjoy lamb. The calzone is good but I have other favorite pizza places. I just really like their Italian entree meals!"}
{"text":"Came about a month ago in an effort to explore the restaurants in the Westlake-type area. Had a pretty weird and underwhelming experience. 

One: It was a weeknight and just to be safe, we called ahead and made a reservation. When we arrived exactly on time, they seemed surprised to see us and had us wait for a table for a little bit, even though there were several open ones. Why offer reservation options if you don't understand the concept? I also heard the owner loudly bitching at his staff for not letting him know that someone had made a reservation. 

Two: When we placed our order, I went to order my entree along with soup AND salad, which was written clearly in black-and-white on the restaurant menu I held in my hand. The fellow who took our order (who I assume may be an owner), snapped that you only get soup OR salad, not both. I calmly explained to him (and showed him for good measure) that the menu clearly stated soup AND salad. Despite my cold, hard proof, he continued to argue with me that the menu was wrong, and \"most places don't even offer salad or soup included, let alone both.\" My argument is that Pepper's in Lakewood gives you salad, rolls and PASTA. Marconi's in Huron gives you salad, endless bread and PASTA. I'm totally fine if you only offer one appetizer, just stand by how you represent your business and have a little integrity. 

There were  also a number of weird, rookie mistakes they made like bringing us our meal with no silverware, so we had to flag them down to bring some. The rolls were great, but that's all I got. Everything else was confirmation that we should stick with the Italian we know: Pepper's in Lakewood (atmosphere) and Marconi's in Huron (value)."}
{"text":"Jo Jo Carloni's is so much more than a pizza joint or a hole in the wall.  I had been to the old location many times and kept coming back for the food (not so much the very 'quaint' [aka: really small] atmosphere).  

I tried the new location last night with a few girlfriends... and was very impressed with the location, staff, service, and yes... the food.
We started with salads and then ordered the cod with mushroom risotto and lasagna.  Both were excellent.  You can tell that attention was paid to the details and that everything was scratch made.

We were checked on by the owners... and even other members of the service team as they passed by with water... or to clear plates (even though they were not assigned to our table!). 

I had known where they were moving to and wondered if they could transition from such a small intimate location to a much larger location... keeping service and food at a high level...  To my delight... I think the service and the food are even better!  

Would recommend reservations especially on a weekend.  Our table was waiting for us. 

I think I have a new favorite... definitely a new local Italian favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Loved it!  My husband and I came here on a whim and boy, am I glad we did.  Jo Jo Carloni's is currently located in a small strip mall and you can easily pass it by without knowing that it's there. They will be moving to a much larger place in Berea this winter and I'm glad to hear that.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Even the staff on the younger side were very professional.  I really didn't know what I wanted to eat and quite honestly, we weren't expecting much when we walked in so the amazing menu caught me off guard. There were several appetizers I wanted to try (calamari, mozzarella balls, and stuffed banana peppers were the three I will be back for) as well as several main dishes that looked amazing so it was hard to decide.  I finally went with the Veal Marsala and it was to die for!  Probably the best I've ever had.  Dinners come with either soup or salad but do yourself a favor and get the Italian wedding soup.  It was delicious!  I loved it! Dinners aren't cheap ($20 for my Veal Marsala) but the portions are large and I felt you got your moneys worth.  I didn't feel like having a drink that night but they had a wine list consisting of Italian wines that was hard to pass up.  I will save room for those next time.  I also saw that they take $10 off bottles of wine for take out or delivery.  That's a bargain!  My husband had pizza. I took a bite and really liked it as well. As far as dessert goes, we took cannoli's to go and they were excellent. The other desserts, all home made, looked fabulous too.  I will be back and when they are closer to me in Berea, I'm sure I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Love ,love,love this place. The food is amazing and fresh...  (My favorite is penne vodka). Everything is homemade. You come here,you feel like part of their family. John and Jen are great people, very personable and always coming out to talk to you .  If you're in the area,give this place a try. You WILL NOT NE DISAPPOINTED!!!! I would eat here 5 days a week if I could."}
{"text":"Jo Jo's has really come along way.  They added many new items to their menu.  The sauce is delicious.  They have gnocchi.  You can get it in pesto or regular sauce.  The owners really go beyond to please their customers.  The wait staff are very friendly and professional.  We go almost every weekend.  Seats are starting to get filled up quickly on weekends.  This place is doing great"}
{"text":"Four words. This place is fire. The food is made from scratch and the owners are top notch and actually care about the customer experience. With all the chains that exist for dining, it's hard to remember what it's like to dine at a restaurant where the establishment actually cares about your experience, but this place definitely cares and makes it a point to show it. They truly are genuine people and love what they do. If you are looking for stand up, quality food that rocks be sure to stop in. I know I will be. Oh, and they serve Chill Wave :) can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This place was just okay when my husband and I tried it out. I wish I thought it was better since it is locally owned, but all of the food we ordered was just mediocre. I didn't care for their sauce or cheese on their pizza and for me that is a no no. It's nice that hey deliver and that it is an option when in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"Back again...this time for pizza and beer. Spicy hot pepper pizza and frosty-mug-cold Italian beer (Menabrea) win win win!"}
{"text":"Finally ,I found Italian place worth every inch of the drive. The best Italian food in Cleveland is here. 

Deliciouso.."}
{"text":"What a gem! First off I will say my wife and I eat out about 3-4 times a week, ranging from Cambodian to Korean. We moved here about a year ago where we were used to hand made wings, homemade sauces, and pizza. We have been disappointed until tonight!  The boneless wings were chunks of chicken breast twice the size of normal bone in wings with crisp breading and spot on honey mustard, my favorite. The honey bbq was tangy with a slight kick. The regular wings were jumbo with a little less flavor and moisture but better than Bdubs. Pizza was an explosion of flavor. Sauce was on the sweeter side with both mozzarella and provolone cheese to give good depth. Crust was handmade and tossed with mix between a thin crust and hand tossed at pizza hut. Not too doughy or crisp, just right. Nice selection of beer at a good price, 5 bucks for chimay blue. Met the owner and was more than helpful and friendly.  Can not wait to try the soup, dessert, parm, and homemade periogies."}
{"text":"This is by far, the best Italian restaurant in the area.  It's a small place tucked away in a little plaza.  The owners are super nice,  down to earth people.  Very relaxing atmosphere.  Their food is amazing.  We stop at least once a week.  Everything has exceeded our expectations.  I love their lasagna; his sauce is amazing.  They aim to please."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a small town, authentic Italian restaurant, then look no further than Jo Jo's!

Every time I visit this place, I have the hardest time figuring out what I want because they have SUCH a delicious-looking menu. Everything I have ordered from here has been so wonderful and clearly freshly made--which is hard to come by in Ohio sometimes. 

The portion sizes are pretty big, but that just means leftovers! Which is also pretty awesome since the price of the food here is really affordable. And don't think about skipping dessert! Man is Jo Jo's dessert good. My husband and I were so full, but couldn't pass up the tiramisu and boy did we eat every last drop because it was so flavorful and delish!

The only downside is the size of the restaurant, which pretty small and only holds a few tables. I would go early or call ahead to make sure you get a seat in this can't-miss spot."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews - this is a hidden gem! Eggplant parm was fabulous as was the penne arrabiatta - advertised as spicy, and it was right on point. Homemade warm starter rolls, just big enough - eccellente all around! Moving soon to a 140 seat spot, surely to fill also !!"}
{"text":"My experience was a bit different, last august, I was staying at a local motel, called Jojos n ordered chicken parm, it came with soup n salad n bread. But NO UTENSILS! When I called the restaurant to tell them n maybe have them bring me some, I tipped driver $5, but alas No! The man who answered the phone said I should have asked for utensils, I said I'm at a motel, hmmm May I speak to the manager please? I'm the owner! He told me and hung up the phone! He was short and curt and rude and very proud of it! Maybe an anomaly? You decide for yourself..."}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish pizza! Ours had the pepperoni and black olives and it was perfect.
Jo Jo's was a little busy when we arrived but we were seated in less than five minutes.
Will be returning soon to try other dishes. Wait staff was stellar!"}
