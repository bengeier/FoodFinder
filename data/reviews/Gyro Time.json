{"text":"Nasty!!!  The lamb/beef \"gyro\" from Gyro Time belonged in the garbage not on my plate.  The first time we received our gyros, the meat was cold.  We sent them back.  The replacements were warm, but the meat tasted rancid.  The \"tzaziki\" sauce did not resemble sauce so much as congealed glop.  The tomatoes and onion on the gyro looked tired.  The pita bread was thick and soggy.  Overall, a very disappointing and costly experience.  On the upside, the fries were tasty."}
{"text":"If only it were possible to give zero stars..... Ugh......A zero is too generous. This place is really deserving of a negative number! So easily the worst gyro I have ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever had! It was actually some of the worst food that I have tasted period!!! That says a lot because I have had some REALLY BAD GRUB from all corners of the earth!  The place was clean and the service was very friendly...... but the food? NASTAY!!!!!!! I had the gyro combo with a side of grilled zucchini and my friend had the felafel combo with fries. My meat was extremely dry and it didn't even come how the menu described it. The zucchini was obviously frozen and placed on the grill before defrosting. It was unseasoned and had the consistency of an uncooked piece of eel. Super tasteless and slimy! My friend's felafel was more like \"feel awful\"! It was extremely dry and tasteless as well. We also had what I guess was supposed to be hummus and tzatziki? EEEKKK! I have tasted soiled paper towels with more flavor and better mouth feel! Needless to say neither of us finished our food despite the fact that we were both extremely hungry prior to recieving our orders.  It is really sad when the best thing at a \"Greek\" joint is the ketchup packet. The fact that they offered a \"Barbecued Gyro\" dressed with barbecue sauce and American cheese should have been our que to exit.   If you are in the area, and you are dying of hunger......just go ahead and die! This place is the best endorsement for anorexia and bulimia that I have run across in a looooonnnnngggggg time!   If Zeus were real, he'd send a lightening bolt to this joint tout suite!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this location often.  I would order the Junior gyro and a side of gyro meat that I would take home and have with a salad and my doggies!  The staff was always young but friendly and nice.  Today I went and ordered my regular.  I immediatly noticed that it was about $3 more than in the past.  I balked and the black girl behind the counter said that they had raised all their prices apologetically.  I commented that the side of meat must be a huge portion for that price. The food came and it was LESS meat than I have ever received before.  The side of meat was pretty much the same as the Gyro.  The girl apologised and offered to make me some more.  I said that would be fine.  A minute later this young white girl came over to ask what the problem was.  She said that was the amount of meat that was served and I could get a refund if I wanted.  I told her I used to come here a lot and the portion had gone down but the price went up.  Her response was that she had worked there for 7 years and it was always the same amount.  I again commented that I am a regular ( never seen her before) and that this is not what I usually got.  She told me she is the general manager of several locations and quoted what she probably learned in fast food supervisor training in a tone of voice that you get out of an exasperated teenager that thinks they know best. At this point out of principle I said I would take the refund.  I hope they did not reuse the meat!  Even though their food is decent it is now priced on par with a restaurant.  If I wanted snotty teenaged managers I would just go to McDonalds.  You will have a better experience with Paymons or Stephanos where they have a great atmosphere and booze. Just read the other reviews and I will add that it is usually fairly clean and with the exception of the \"manager\" the staff has usually been pretty cool."}
{"text":"The food doesn't get any fresher or better than this place offers.   It was soooooooooo delish"}
{"text":"We have been coming to all the Gyro time locations in Vegas since 1978 at the old store on Desert Inn! This has been one of our favorite restaurants ever since then ! If we know we will be on the west side of Vegas we go to the Charleston/ Decatur location, but most of the time we go to the Eastern & Russell store! The regular gyros are great! I do miss the little kids versions of the Gyro's, as they were just the right size if I wasn't too hungry ! I would love for them to bring those back!!! The staff / service is fine, but we come for the meat & the sauce which tastes so yummy! The fries are good too! We will keep coming back ! Sure wish they were open on Sundays for after church lunch, and wish they had a location closer to Henderson / Green Valley! Also they close at 8pm so that eliminates any late night gyro run ! In a 24 hour town like Vegas , they should try to cater  to the different shift workers!!!! Many a night a gyro sounds so good BUT they are closed!"}
{"text":"Why do I remember Gyro Time as being the place to go? What has happened to the Gyro Time I remember on West Charleston that at this location is missing? Well for one no one is slicing your gyro meat anymore...microwaved? Is that what I saw? Anyway the place was clean....so clean that they at 2:00pm on Saturday afternoon they were scrubbing and mopping the floors with wet soapy (bleachy) water as food was being prepared and a place full of patrons. Not something I wanna hear or see when my food is being prepared. It must be nostalgia I remember - not the gyros. Easily forgettable."}
{"text":"Just pulled up at 7:26p.m. Sign on door says open til 8! Neon open sign off and door locked! Way to run a business! Just lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating there and the grilled chicken gyro was excellent I recamend eating there every chance you get the food is AWSOME ....."}
{"text":"Get the gyro time! It is loaded with lamb and is so delicious with the Greek yogurt, onions, tomatoes, and hot sauce. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"So I contemplated on even writing a review the FIRST time they screwed up but my boyfriend would still come eat here so I didn't. Now that we will NEVER be returning, I'll go ahead and share. So about two months we went to get a gyro and a falafel, we said, on the gyro, no tomatoes or onions. We get home, and there's onions on the gyro. We called, they gave us credit. Two weeks later we decide to use our credit and get again, the same thing, a falafel and a gyro. We get home, no hummus. Which the falafel comes with. We go back, \"hey do you guys messed up again only on a different item.\" The blonde girl with the side ponytail said \"okay we'll write your name down for next time\". So today we go to get two chicken salads, come home after a long day, excited to eat. MY SALAD HAS A HAIR AT THE BOTTOM OF IT. We then called and the blonde girl answers and says \"well if you're not going to show me the hair in the salad I can't do anything about it\" we said well \"you've done it before cause you guys have messed up TWICE BEFORE\" and she says \"well there's new rules so...\" So my boyfriend says \"can I speak to the manager?\" And she says with the smartest tone \"I am the manager!\" We were appalled that a \"manager was talking to us with that kind of attitude.\" My boyfriend said \"well how come the guy who was there had \"manager\" on his name tag?\" And she goes \"he's another manager.\"  We were so fed up and just told her to have a good day. Instead of her saying \"I'm really sorry about what happened today. I hope you guys do come back to our establishment.\" She says \"thanks! You too!!\"  Hair in food, crappy customer service that can never get anything right. Figure it out."}
{"text":"The food is a perfect combo of pseudo greek food and crack. It's addictive and will piss off a gyro connoisseur. It's so good I eat two and sometimes wish I had a third one. I could drink the sour cream I meant cucumber sauce. Love this place for what it is! Addictive and delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best gyro's in town!  The tzatziki sauce is the best in town for sure!  Gyro with extra meat is the way to go!  Dinner was great."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Exceptionally clean bathroom. Delicious Greek salad! I'm hooked for life!  Friendly staff. Really nice place and consistently good quality."}
{"text":"I went to Gyro Time today and ordered a gyro for takeout...extra onions. I told the cashier I was going to go grab an ice tea. (There is a Starbucks two doors down). I walked over, ordered my tea, and was walking out the door and who is walking in?? Jorge, the cashier from Gyro Time.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE great customer service. Jorge went above and beyond.  I didn't ask, nor imply I wanted him to bring me my sandwich over to Starbucks.  I more implied \"I am going out and coming back for my gyro...don't let someone else take my gyro while I am gone.\"  What a wonderful surprise and a very big WOW! I am so impressed! Thank you Gyro Time for hiring such a great guy to represent you. There is more to brag about Jorge...but let's just say, he is a very big reason I will be going back time and again!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! This place gave my husband food poising! He is violently ill! He ordered the gyro and I got the grilled chicken gyro. I feel fine, but his meal made him go to the hospital.   The health department needs to take a closer look at this restaurant's food handing procedures.  Again DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"This location is okay. The falafel sandwich was nothing amazing but it was filling and a bit too pricy. Their gyros are what you come for with this place. The baklava was very chewy and greasy too, very disappointing. Gyro time seems like a one trick pony."}
{"text":"Nice big gyro for your money. The meat was the usual shaved cone meat, (lamb and beef) but good nonetheless. The french fries were hot and crispy and the tzatziki was really good. Make sure to order an extra sauce to eat with your french fries."}
{"text":"Food is average and not too expensive, service is fast. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a gyro sandwich for lunch. They were very fast and the food was served hot. The gyro meat was very fresh and the meal was very good. I'd recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"The people are friendly, the place is clean, I've  only had the Gyro Time because I haven't wanted to try anything else yet. I go about twice weekly to get this for lunch. The only improvement I can see that's needed is a drive thru, somehow. Unfortunately the Starbucks on the end of the mall stores has it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I walked out satisfied or not. Lately I've been having crazy pita which is almost like gyros and their pitas have a good balance of veggies and meat and it comes with fries. I ordered the gyro time as is. If I knew lettuce was an option then I would've added lettuce. Overheard a girl order and add lettuce to her order so if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have known it was an option because it is no where to be found on the menu nor did the cashier ask or mention it.  $9.67 for a gyro and a drink. I guess its a reasonable price being that the gyro was stuffed with lots of meat. The gyro was flavorful but it was missing something for me which was the lettuce. I'll be back again because I don't know many places in south LV that serve gyros."}
{"text":"It was good! The cashier was friendly and the place was seemingly clean. We didn't stay to eat, but placed our order to-go.  The Gyro was simple enough but flavorful and I thought the meat was good enough quality. They were fast and efficient and I have been back since! I think this place gets overlooked a lot."}
{"text":"I walked in craving for pita bread and the person who took my order is nice and friendly. I think I may have met the manager when he made a suggestion for the person to smile more. I thought it was rather funny because it totally caught me off guard, but it is nice to see good management. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($7.65) which comes in a Greek Pita Bread filled with lemon-marinated chicken breast, onions, sliced tomatoes, lettuce, and it's serve with a side of their creamy cucumber sauce. I like that they give a generous amount of meat, the chicken is juicy and very flavorful. Also I got an order of French Fries ($2.59) and it was serve hot and crispy. I like dipping the fries in their cucumber sauce, it taste way better than ranch. What I am most pleased is that the food is delicious, it's reasonably priced for the amount they give, and this place is well worth coming back to. I'm definitely going to try other items on their menu. My next visit would be the Barbecue Gyro and Falafel, it looks savory and tasty!"}
{"text":"great place, we love the food here and the service. we were very sad to see the eastern location  close."}
{"text":"I am very dissatisfied with your owner and managerial skills. I recently bought three baklava they were very oily, not flaky and not sweet, they usually are great. I was told by one of your managers to contact her to discuss the baklava so I went into the store she was already gone and your other manager that never would come out of the back decided to call the owner and the owner decided he wasn't going to do anything besides replace one baklava. This customer service is un exceptable especially    for an owner. I have been going to gyro time for over 20+ years but will not go back again. I don't think $7.00 was worth losing a lifelong customer. How much do you think they are worth? I am in business for myself and would never treat my customers as if they were a liar.  Keep up the great work in running customers off."}
{"text":"Not what I was craving but not bad.. Baklava was not made correct but also bland..gyro had no flavor at all.. Cucumber sauce craved dill or something just tasted like sour cream n yogurt.. Soda was crisp n fresh staff friendly and place very clean.. Grilled zucchini was good but lacked salt sorta reminded me of the bland food they serve when I visit my grandmother in her retirement home. .. Won't come back but wasn't the worst"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Good Memories of Gyro Time on W. Charleston have all faded. Gyro Time was once tasty. Now just serving overpriced calories with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"I'm on vacation from Hawaii and always looking for a great Greek place, believe it or not, comparable to really good ones back home. First of all, we were greeted with a friendly smile by Aria. First impressions work well with me. A generous sample of their delicious spinach salad also got me. So we ordered 2 lamb/beef gyros, a spinach salad with feta, walnuts,cranberries & fries. Then she bought our food to our table, still being pleasant! Awesome! The entire experience made the delicious food taste even better & the portions were huge. Definitely satisfied!! Everything can't be perfect because there's always room for improvement & such but Gyro Time is definitely worth five starsShari & Char"}
{"text":"Great tasty gyro ,sauce and fries.  No meal deals available.  Clean areas and very friendly staff!  Ice teas are very good quality also"}
{"text":"I don't always buy the hype, and try and give them all a try for myself, even if it's a bad hype.  This place is good when your near by and in a rush. Never busy, and quick enough. I would have given it a fair 3.6 stars if it was like 1/2 as cheap or twice the quality or quantity. This place would be the shit in Bridgeport Nebraska!"}
{"text":"The McDonald's equivalent of Greek/Mediterranean food. Everything about this place oozed chain location. The lamb/beef was very salty, dry, and seemed like it had been sitting out in a heat lamp all day. The tzatziki sauce was a bit flavorless, as was the pita bread. Avoid this place if you like flavor, quality, and authenticity."}
{"text":"Best Gyro I've ever had. Is a little pricey if you get a drink & fries. Usually I get the Original Gyro & share the fries with a friend since the basket is HUGE!  The Original sandwich has Lamb & Beef in it. Yum. Tzarziki sauce is good!  They get busy during lunch so expect to wait."}
{"text":"The hummus plate is my favorite!  Great garlicky hummus, wonderfully sautéed veggies and the pita bread is soft, warm, and chewy!  The only downside is the tomatoes, it would work better if they were cherry or grape tomatoes like they used to have instead of whole tomato slices"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, but sometimes you just need a gyro.  And if you're willing to eat a gyro with microwaved lamb meat, tasteless tzatsiki sauce and decent pita . . . well, it is possible to do a lot worse."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for a while, I go a few times a year. I went today and the meat tasted different and wasn't really hot. The people working weren't as friendly as they normally are .. it was a change.. they really didn't give eye contact and some of them didn't seem happy. The sauce is classic and one of the best parts of going..."}
{"text":"So for the first thing wrong with this place, the food is expensive and they do not offer meal deals so if you want to get a gyro with fries and drink it will be over 10 bucks.  Now on to the food:  pretty awful.  The gyro meat was dry and really had no taste and the tzatziki sauce pretty much tasted like yogurt.  It, as well, had no taste.  The spanikopita was bland. If you want good gyros go to Yannis Greek Grill"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for \"The Original\".  Large portion of lamb. Love the \"Z\" sauce. My order was ready quickly, out the door and on the go. Didn't order fries but they ended up in the bag. When I asked if it was my order, they apologized for the mistake. They asked if I'd mind just having the FREE fries. My kids didn't mind the fries! Everything happens for a reason. :)"}
{"text":"Okay. Food is prepackaged frozen falafels. Don't have any tahini sauce. Very generic. Not worth the $7 a plate not including $2.25 for French fries."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place ... It's one of my first gyros so therefore I compare to here ... The meat is always tasty their tzatziki sauce is delish and their Greek salad is huge and yummy as well plus comes with warm pita bread I once had an employee that irked me wrong and had a tift with but she is gone now .. I like to stop by for lunch pretty simple and fresh"}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied with the yummy meal I just had. Fast & great service. I also noticed the establishment was very clean. Thumbs up - recommended 100%."}
{"text":"A lunch break spent at a nearby store brought me here, actually my second trip but for some reason it was closed the first time I tried.  I was really looking forward to a good Gyro  and they delivered.  I got the chose the Gyro Time Sandwich.  The Original! Charbroiled mixture of beef & lamb mixed with a flavorful blend of spices. Sliced thin & wrapped in a grilled Pita bread with fresh tomatoes and onions.Served with a side of our famous creamy cucumber sauce.  It was delish defiantly took care of my craving!  The in side is clean but a tight space they have outside seating as well for nice weather.  I will be back for my next craving!"}
{"text":"TRIED SOMETHING NEW  I recommend coming here and trying a gyro! It was my boyfriend's first time eating a gyro, and he really liked it. This place had delicious food! Their fries are amazing and fresh. My boyfriend tried the \"Gyro Time\" and I had the \"Grilled Chicken\". Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Best place in town to get a gyro - hands down.  We (as in my sidekick hubby and me) go here about once a month.  Everything is made to order, fresh and consistently good.  Like really good.  The gyros are out of this world and the french fries are the best around.  They're those fries that aren't shoestring but aren't steak fries - the perfect thickness on fries without a doubt.   The gyros are the star of the show here - lamb, tomatoes, onions all in a soft, warm pita and that freaking marvelous tzatziki sauce.  The hubs spices his up with some hot sauce but I like mine as is.   I've also tried the grilled chicken sandwich - holy mother delicious.  Perfectly seasoned and grilled chicken along with lettuce, tomato, onions and feta cheese (is there anything on earth betta than feta?!) inside a warm pita.  So good. We usually get a piece of baklava to go and that satisfies our sweet tooth and then some.  Layer after layer of sweet, sticky, flaky goodness that's just too delicious to pass up.  Suggestion: take it home and nuke it for about 15 seconds.  You're welcome.   The place is always clean, never super crowded and the employees there are so wonderful.  Very personable, cool, easy to talk to and always treat us like friends coming over for dinner, not just random customers. My only complaint is that they close kind of on the early side (I think 8pm) and they're not open on Sundays.  But at the same time, I can appreciate that they're closed on Sundays to allow employees a day of rest.  Right on.   If you're looking for low key, honest to goodness delicious food - gyros, fries, pita sandwiches, baklava (I could go on and on but you get the point), this place is for you!"}
{"text":"This location is on Russell and Eastern in the McCarran Marketplace between Starbucks, Port of Subs and now in the process of building a new Chipotle right next to it. I came lunchtime and it got pretty busy around 1:30. This review is more of a 3.5 out of 5 but not quite a 4. We ordered the gyro time gyro (beef and lamb), the grilled chicken gyro, fries plus feta and one drink. They don't have combos, everything is ordered individually and it cost around $20. A little pricey but that's okay. Everything was fresh and had good sized portions. The fries were pretty large, you could definitely share them. Now onto the flavor. I don't want to say bland because it Did have good flavor but it needed a little \"umpf \". Maybe they did that to appeal to a larger group of tastebuds.I feel like it would have been better if they put feta inside the gyros, maybe I'll try that next time. Each of the gyros came with a pretty big side of tzaziki sauce however, there was No tang to it at all. Very creamy and good texture but again I wish it had more \"umpf \". Meat was tender but not softest I've had and the onions they put with the beef/lamb gyro were very sharp tasting, had to take a few out. Overall, if I was in the area and craving a gyro or craving something healthier than a burger I would definitely come here. It was good, and hit the spot, just not the best."}
{"text":"First time here and I was not happy with the customer service, very rude. I ordered the chicken gyro and it did not taste like anything needed way more seasoning. Will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Good service but a bit pricey 4 Gyros, 4 Drinks & 2 fries $50!   The Tzatzaki sauce could use some flavor, tastes like cucumbers mixed in sour cream."}
{"text":"This location has the absolute best employee working the front register. He is so charming and always has a great attitude & friendly smile. Great gyros & excellent service!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Horrible .... Worst gyro I have had, pita was soggy meat was microwaved . Dog food tastes better... Sorry no stars neg 5..."}
{"text":"I visit Las Vegas a lot, and there are a few places that I go to eat every time I am there. Gyro Time is one of those places that I love to go to. The food is really good, the portions are large and the price is right. The place is nice and clean, and the services is fast and friendly. I really like the cucumber sauce and the baklava. This is not a Vegas tourist trap, it's more like a local lunch stop, so it's not crowded or packed with hungover, loud or obnoxious vacationers."}
{"text":"The gyro might be huge but huge isn't always a good thing.  The pita bread is delicious however everything else is subpar. You can't really mess up tomatoes and onions but the meat was super dry, almost to the point of eating beef jerky dry. The tatziki sauce was bland, if you're going to call it your \"signature cucumber sauce\" it better be something good.  It tasted like plain Greek yogurt, no spices at all.  For an $8 price tag it delivers with $2 flavor. A huge dissapointment."}
{"text":"Great gyros.   I'm a big eater so I wish there was a super size option.  Lol.   Good fries too"}
{"text":"Good. The hummus was really good. Close to Homemade.  Not enough lamb flavor in the meat. Perhaps more mutton is needed.  Good value."}
{"text":"Really?1978 how is this place still in business ? They call it a gyro shaved ultra thin meat that looks like arbys.some sliced tomatos and a few onions.no tzsiki dressing or feta.the sour cream dressing is on the side.unbelievable going to greek festival tomorrow .if they show up they'd  be laughed put of the festival.the help there were very nice.ic you want a real gyro sandwich go to stephanos"}
{"text":"I'm am very disappointed in this store I have always had good service here. I ordered 2 gyro salads they gave me Greek salads no meat for 12 dollars. I've gotten salads here with meat. I got all the way home before I saw no meat. If some one orders a gyro salad you would think they would at least ask if I wanted meat. If i would have wanted a greek salad i would ask for a greek salad. I said gyro.When I called them on the phone they were not too nice. I'll be finding a new gyro place. There's one by my post office I guess I'll give them a shot"}
{"text":"There is something about there Gyros that I just crave.  I really like the smell when I enter the store.  The staff was very friendly and the service was fast.  While I don't go all of the time when I am craving a Gyro.  this is the place"}
{"text":"Overall, I'm not impressed. The food was very bland in flavor. The pita was not great. Just won't be returning."}
{"text":"I like this place, I'll totally keep coming here.  tbh I wasnt expecting much from a place in a strip mall manned with a couple younger peeps, but it was actually really good!  The guys working there were nice and the place is super clean.  I got the regular basic gyro, and I was surprised at how tasty it was!  They use super thin meat, a nice soft pita, and it's pretty big... I'm a big boy and I can eat, so yeah.  Their frys were super hot and fresh outta the fryer too.  Overall, fair price for the portion, tasty, and hot.  Good place to grab some quick food, totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fast and very friendly. Franky was amazing and I will be back often just to have such friendly amazing customer service. Thank you Franky for being so awesome."}
{"text":"This place is BUSY!   Honestly the Gyros are really great here!   If you are looking for a quick lunch. Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"This Gyro Time location is the best in town, the food is always fresh & made to order! It's consistently delicious every time I order lunch from here. The staff is super friendly & pleasant, Sadie & Frankie are awesome! So if you like steak gyros & not to mention really good fries then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this location during work as I travel the whole city . This location was very clean . As an owner of a window cleaning service I always notice how clean or dirty a place is. I was always a fan of the bar b que  gyro but today I tried the steak . It was awesome . The French fries are awesome as well . My order may have been a dollar or so more than other chain fast food , but at least at Gyro Time it was real food."}
{"text":"This place is decent if I got a craving for Gyros. Stay away from the Chicken Gyro though, that was not good at all.   I dont think I would go back since I found one that was so much better in the Galleria mall in henderson. Kyklos is so much bettter."}
{"text":"Overall a solid gyros sandwich. Taste great, nice portion size. The price, while a bit high IMO, is in line with other places serving gyros sandwiches so I can't complain too much about that. Everything \"fast food\" in general has gone up a lot in the past few years.   The one thing I will complain about is that they close at 8pm. How do you close a restaurant so early in Vegas? Are they afraid of vampires or something? Just dumb and throwing away money IMO."}
{"text":"For a mom, the drive-thru is pretty brilliant. When I'm very busy, I don't have time for sit-down restaurants but I LOVE gyros. To have the option of grabbing a quick gyro instead of Chipotle, or worse...McDonald's etc. is refreshing. The tzatziki sauce is great and they give you the perfect amount on the side. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The cucumber sauce is normally mixed in the gyros in my experience. Here it was in a small container as a side, which in the big scheme of things it worked out just fine.   The meat was tasty, but I love the taste of the lamb and beef blended together in this fashion.   Service was super fast with a smile.   Seems to cater to the take out crowd or the working crowd. We were here during the lunch hour though."}
{"text":"The meat was pretty good and filing. If you need a high calorie meal this is a good place.   So far I cannot find a truely good GYRO in the west."}
{"text":"Wow the other reviews are pretty harsh.  We saw it when we drove by and decided to go in.  Pros:  Super clean, really friendly young man at the counter.  Really big portions.  So big, the three of us couldn't finish one order of fries after eating our sandwiches.  Which brings me to the next PRO.  They have a Junior Gyro.  That was perfect for my 8 year old! And he is a gyro maniac.   $10 for lunch for good quality food is ok in my book.  The junior gyro is $4, and they got an extra star just for that. I hate having to pay adult price for an adult size meal.  My son loves to eat good healthy food, and after a 90 minute session at Sky Zone (look it up), he KILLED that gyro.   Cons.  The tzaziki was a little on the thick side, and more sour creamy than yogurty.  It could have DEFINITELY used some garlic, dill, and yogurt.   The gyro didn't have any cucumbers in it, but it was full of tomatoes and onions.  I suppose if I had known, I would have simply asked for some.    The young man behind the counter was authentically friendly."}
{"text":"Ugh, nobody listens to me when I say \"check it out on Yelp first.\" My dad was dying to go here since he saw their billboard advertising gyros.   The location is clean but had a funky smell that dissipated the longer we were in the restaurant. The service was fast and friendly. The gyro had a lot of meat in it (always a plus in my book!) but it lacked any real flavor. The tzatziki was bland and, I believe, did not contain cucumbers. I had a small sliver of a tomato or two in my gyro - overall, the friendly service couldn't make up for the flavor lacking in this gyro."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken Gyro was juicy and very flavorful.   My only gripe is that the fries are WAY over priced at $2.25 for the amount of fries you get.  Will do business again, but skip on the fries!."}
{"text":"Everything is good when I come here I LOVE their gyro salad! I always get the BBQ Pita too.  The hummus dish is pretty good.  So far so good!   a little pricy sometimes I'm  surprised at my total after I order a gyro and salad.  I tried the falafel in my salad instead of the gyro meat. The falafel they make is wonderful but not worth the price added to the salad. 3.00 to add three falafel nuggets to the salad.? damn.  Its not made of gold.  The price can come down a bit. Especially if you are feeding two people.  Also wish there were more locations. I also hate that they are closed Sunday, I have tried to go 3 times, and forgot they were not open."}
{"text":"So my family and I decided to try this place out on a lunch break one day and it was all right.  We've never been there before and the woman behind the counter didn't speak much at all.  I know we can all read and see what's on the board, but based on the pricing I had assumed there were combos.  So I ordered a turkey hummus sandwich and she typed it in and then just stared at me, so I asked if that came with any sides and she shook her head.  Having to order things individually kind of irritated me but the food was decent once we got it.  Hummus was decent, but certainly not the best I've had.  If you don't mind dealing with catatonic cashiers then the food should suffice for a quick lunch break meal."}
{"text":"If you want a real gyro, go to Greece. If you want an \"Americanized\" gyro, this is the place to go. Yeah, it's not cheap, but if you want cheap, I'm sure there's a Taco Bell, nearby. I've eaten tons of gyros back in New York, and this place comes VERY close (lots of Greek restaurant owners with Greek accents back East, so I think I know what a gyro should taste like). [In response to a jingoistic poster who posted about the staff] I can't say whether or not the kids working there were \"illegals\". I didn't ask them for their papers. What we need are more LEGAL aliens here...like MILLIONS more...the kind who wait on a list to get in, who work hard, and who speak not a lick of English. Yeah, MILLIONS more sounds good to me."}
