{"text":"Excellent lunch service ordered all this for $14.99 sashimi bento ;) we asked for fast service as we were in a rush to get back to work, and they did not keep us waiting. Frequent visitor for lunch as I work nearby, it's always consistent don't think I ever had bad service or poor food quality. They also have veggie options and lots of parking for the lunch rush! Takeout is always ready in 15mins, how great is that? :D"}
{"text":"The food is good here - but it's pricey.  Service is good, but very leisurely, and the place is usually quiet and only moderately busy even at peak hours, so be prepared for a long relaxing meal as this is no place for a quick lunch (strange considering its proximity to the airport).  As this used to be a pizza hut, I am very surprised how well they've managed to re-decorate the place and the overall visual ambiance is much better than a lot of sushi places I've been to. That being said, for some reason they usually decide to play annoying pop music from the radio (which means there are commercials all the time) at a volume that is too high, which definitely kills the mood.  Also, the menu is a little on the pricey side and does not compete with downtown/Brampton prices. Because of this, it's hard to choose lots of different things without spending too much, and there aren't many good combos that have a bit of everything, which makes this place not so good for a first time sushi-goer.  The food is actually really great. I can't vouch too much for the Korean side of things, but all of the Japanese dishes are top quality, and the sushi chef is extremely traditional with presentation (even when you get take-out). However, the staff were unwilling to make a simple substitution usually common in downtown sushi places, even though I offered to pay for this substitution. (I wanted yam tempura roll instead of California).  In conclusion, this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for, but it's one of the only sushi places in the area and definitely is not the worst I've been to. For take-out, I'd definitely recommend Sushi-Ya across the street instead as they are faster and better quality, but if you want to sit down and have a meal (or care for some Korean food) Sushi Dragon is better."}
{"text":"Wanted Sashimi box - not available. But showed me another dish and said it was the same, but $8 more. Never asked for drink order. Had to ask for bill, never came.  Service, not."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Service was fast, their takeout options are just as good and inexpensive as dining in and the Sushi was fresh. Loved the quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"With the nasty weather today we needed some Korean soul food on the way home, so we popped into Sushi Dragon because I remembered it had a combination of sushi and Korean food.  I ordered the Chicken Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap (rice with mixins in a stone bowl) and the hubby ordered LA Kal Bi (marinated short ribs) and to start we had an order of spicy salmon rolls.   (We like to judge all sushi restaurants based on thier spicy salmon rolls-we LOVE them).     The rolls were standard, decent for $6.95 but not memorable.  My rice dish was just meh, but the hubby enjoyed his ribs (though I have to admit, he rarely has a bad meal when it contains red meat).    My main complaint is that they didn't serve the side dishes (Kimchi, bean sprouts, beans, etc) right away.  I had to ask for them when I realized we weren't getting them.  The waitress said nothing, turned around and returned with 3 dishes.  UH HELLO PEOPLE.  When we order two dishes that are Korean and that I ordered in near perfect Korean (thank you very much), you figure we know a thing or two about Korean food....GIVE US THE DANG SIDE DISHES!!!!    This is a HUGE pet peeve of mine at Korean restaurants and because of this I probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst attempt art sushi I have ever tried.  The fish smelled, there were flies in my saki and the server literally disappeared after dropping my food.  I would avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I personally didn't like their sushi combo. It was not fresh and it was like $20! I would recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"My SO and I stopped in to Sushi Dragon for dinner tonight.  I remember stopping by this place for lunch a few years back whenever I was in the area.  Being close to the airport, we expected the place to be a bit more packed for dinner time, but we were one of the few patrons when had dinner tonight.  While skimming the menu, we were shocked that this place was expensive; for a moment, I thought of suggesting we leave and go elsewhere but we were both hungry.    We opted for the individual dinners - he got a Salmon Bento Box (the Matsu) and I got a Sushi & Maki combo (Dragon Combo #1).  The food was quite good.  We both were satisfied with our meals.  With the limited sushi in the Airport area, this place has descent lunch specials.  I would consider coming back for lunch.  For dinner there are other reasonably priced food in the area."}
{"text":"Well im from NY and i thought trying sushi HERE would be good but i thought wrong the sushi was weird NO ONE BEATS SAKURA!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant thinking it was an AYCE restaurant and found out it was no longer one.  Spacious inside with warm ambiance.  Disappointing that the lunch bento boxes didn't have dinner versions as our group really wanted that.  Food was typical standard fare, nothing remarkable.  Service was a bit on the inattentive side as we had to request water."}
{"text":"Came here after a massage because it was close. Thought we'll try a new restaurant.. what a bad decision. Now only did the food took 30 mins to come, the sushi was not fresh at all. The portion were small, even for a lunch portion. I would not recommend coming here.   I believe it's family own business, so when it's busy - they are lacking staff to attend to the customers."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't that good. I got Miso soup, Spicy salmon rolls, rainbow rolls, green dragon rolls, and assorted sashimi. Took 15 mins to get someone's attention to order our food. Short in staff, only had one food server. The rice on the sushi was dry and hard. But the staff was very sweet and you can tell she was trying her best to serve the whole restaurant during lunch hours."}
{"text":"I was here on a quick work lunch. The outside building looks generic and not like a place you'd go for good sushi. The interior decor was really nice and felt like a well designed pseudo-authenic dining experience. The food was delish...... I had a bunch of rolls and tempura. Tasty! The only negative is that I had to ask our waitress 3 times for water, and she barely made eye contact..... but hey, I'm from Manhattan....so I'm kinda used to that.  I'll never be back in that part of the world..... but it was a decent lunch"}
{"text":"Ho-hum. I had a business lunch here a couple weeks ago and ordered their sashimi box. This is a bento box style lunch with salad, nigiri, tempura, sashimi and maki. You do get five different types of food in this box but the portions are not too large, so you won't get too full. Is this a good thing or a bad? I haven't made up my mind.  The service was pretty quick but then again the patronage was a bit sparse given that it was the lunch hour.   I would come back only if I couldn't find a better sushi lunch spot in the area using Yelp."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I have to say that I love this place..it's very fresh and the food always comes quickly. If you want sushi and a soup w/tea it's very good."}
{"text":"Great Bi Bim Bap at this location but then again I'm new to the 'Bi Bim Bap' Korean food world. I had the steak one and my partner had the chicken and I must say the steak is by far the best!  I would not go for the sushi as it's overpriced and not good at all!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good food wise. The miso soup is nicely flavoured, the salad was ok (the dressing was a little overpowering). My friend and I got the love boat, $45.95. Which I thought was pretty pricey. The quality of sashimi was really good. One of the only cons is that everything is so pricey, I mean a bento box is $20 when most other sushi places charge $12-15. Even the special maki rolls seemed really expensive compared to other places. Another con is that service is pretty slow, after a while our waitress stopped checking up with us and it took so long to get our bill. Pretty good food, but not enough to make up for the price you pay and the service you get."}
{"text":"It looks shady from the outside. And usually quite empty. I have been there twice, one time I tried their bento combo, another I tried their korean bibimbap. It's actually better than I expected. The lady server/owner provides good service, although a bit reserved (which is fine with me, I am not a chit-chat kind of person). And unlike the sushi joint across the street, this place is way more spacious."}
{"text":"Our favourite place on the Airport Strip for sushi and sashimi. The chef knows well that I'm crazy about tobiko and puts it on the small boat sashimi platter and the maki rolls (whether they are supposed to come topped with tobiko or not). My kids vacuum up all the sushi and the Iro Iro tempura plate, which is always steaming hot and never greasy. Recently I saw how well the staff care not just about us but their neighbourhood. The Anime North convention was taking place across the street and \"our\" place was full of young hungry cosplayers looking for Japanese food (natch, anime fans are all Japanophiles). Was Sushi Dragon phased? No sir! They brought in a bunch of extra staff to take care of the weekend's convention crowd, they put a note on the door \"for better service, one bill per table please\" which makes sense and they gave out $10 menu specials for the convention goers. 3 of the staff also checked on us to make sure we were still getting good service."}
{"text":"Food is good! We ordered some Korean items here, and we're impressed by the food quality and size:) recommend!"}
