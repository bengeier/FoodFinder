{"text":"This place is a gem hidden on Avenue du Parc. The service is amazig with always a smile. Whatever I ate either upstairs or downstairs I never said a bad wprd about it. They always find a way to surprise their clients through new taste explorations. The wines are great since the owner is also the owner of a wine bar next door. You should definitely try the cocktails and the juice of the days. In everything you see the reflection of the hardwork of a team and dedicated manager. I would definitely recommend more the upstairs since there are more selections"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the Mornay pizza. Delicious!! Probably one of the best I've ever had. Just wish there was more of it....

Great ambience and perfect spot for people watching..."}
{"text":"Le cadre tout comme l'offre de pizza sont très originaux."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza ( sauce was one of the best and freshest I've ever had), great decor but bad service. Our waiter was rude to us from the beginning and forgot our drink orders."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Wood fire pizza is delicious! Their tomato sauce is sweet, fresh ingredients. I could eat here every day! 
Decor has the \"unfinished\" looked, so you feel as though they are in the middle of a redecoration project. 
The basement bathroom also feels unfinished. 
Haven't tried their upstairs section that has a different pricier menu. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for thin slice, recommend the pizza margherite, very simple and delicious. Tomato sauce is phenomenal- great combination of sweetness and acidity. Pizzas are baked well in a beautiful looking oven. Attentive service. Price is higher than average and only critique would be that the pizza bottom was slightly soggy- may just be a matter of preference. Otherwise would highly recommend."}
{"text":"After looking up the most trendy restaurants to visit in Montréal, I had high expectations of this place. After my fabulous experience at Rubirosa Ristorante in NYC, I have acquired a fascination toward small restaurants with craft Italian thin crust pizzas and I thought this was going to be one of them.

Moleskine definitely is small. With a few table and mostly bar seating options available, parties larger than four will definitely need some luck to sit with each other for dinner. The restaurant seemed to be pretty empty at around 6pm, right after they opened, which could be a prime time to visit to ensure immediate seating.

I found the concept of paper underneath our plates and pencil to write on the paper to be cute. It reminded me of a game I used to play as a child connecting the dots with my mom. Helped the time go by fast. 

Since the place was empty at 6, we ordered pretty quickly. Our pizza of choice was Salsiccia which had tomato sauce, sausage, arugula, peppers, fior di latte, and grana padano cheese sprinkled on top. Considering the price of the pizza, we were expecting a large thin crust pizza for two, but what came instead was a tiny pizza that could have easily been consumed by a 10 year-old child. 

The tomato sauce made the thin crust pizza so soggy that the pizza was falling apart in our hands and upon consumption of one slice each, we looked like babies who got their food all over their hands and faces. The sausage pieces were few and far in between and the rest of the ingredients were just meh. 

With empty stomachs, instead of preparing for another disappointment with yet another pizza, we decided to save our 20 bucks and feed ourselves elsewhere. 

Despite the emptiness of the space, the waitress was quick to offer us our check upon our informing her of our decision not to get another pizza. I found such service a bit sloppy."}
{"text":"ADORÉ ma visite au Moleskine. Nous avions réservé une table en bas, dans la partie pizzéria/crémerie. 

Le four à bois décore la pièce pour le plaisir des yeux. Des crayons tombent du plafond pour dessiner sur vos menus. Pour vrai, je pense que je rêve de la pizza 4 saisons depuis ma visite. La pâte et la fraîcheur m'ont séduite complètement. De plus, comme c'était une occasion spéciale, on a pu manger plusieurs entrées en groupe : salade de champignons forestiers complètement EXPLOSIVE en bouche, je recommande. Le ceviche de poisson blanc et la salade de betteraves jaunes nous ont rassasiés juste à souhait. Nous avons eu aussi la chance de partager différentes pizzas : la funghi (champignons et sauce mornay, la moins bonne à mon avis), la margherita (exquise et simple), la 4 saisons, la piquante, etc. 

Samedi soir, c'était plein. Service rush, mais de bon coeur. On remercie Mathieu pour son excellent service. 

A bientot !"}
{"text":"J'adore! Le menu change, la pizza est extra (toutes) et l'ambiance est superbe! La sommelière est FAN-TAS-TIQUE!!! On se sent spécial à chaque visite!"}
{"text":"Bon mais rien de particulièrement spécial. On a goûté aux entrées et aux pizza, c'était bon mais il manquait toujours un petit quelque chose aux plats pour dire qu'on se régale pleinement. Pas assez unique et bon pour me convaincre d'y retourner. Le décor était différent, à se demander en fait si le travail était terminé considérant le look pas fini avec des fils qui pendent ou des trous non couverts. J'ai bien aimé les fils de téléphone qui pendent au dessus des tables."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Montreal and had this referred to us by a friend. Great atmosphere, fabulous food, and superior service. Highly recommend. 

Upstairs is excellent."}
{"text":"2e visite pour essayer la pizza: On a choisi la pizza classique Marguerite et la pizza aux champignons Mornay. Les deux étaient vraiment excellentes. La pâte était d'une texture parfaite. On a aimé la sauce tomate, mais qui était peut-être un peu trop en grande quantité. 

On a pris deux cocktails en apéro qui étaient corrects. 

Le vin blanc est servi dans un erlenmeyer et un petit verre, au lieu d'être dans une coupe: spéciale, mais étrange quand même de ne pas le servir dans une coupe."}
{"text":"Ask for a delivery form 3rd party. However, the pizza was burned. Don't think the staffs would give this kind of food to their family. Totally wast time and money."}
{"text":"Very torn about this place. The pizza was good, but thats just it- good. For a price of 22$ per pizza, I was expecting better. I had the culatello pizza, which was very flavourful but the use of hazelnuts on it just made it taste like nutella during some bites. Very cute decor though!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian style pizza

Its very good but there is still room for improvement

Has a nice selection of wines to go with the pizza."}
{"text":"Small portions, good food , great ambience, attentive service. 

Drinks seem inexpensive but really iced down.
Pizza dough is amazing but the toppings could be a little more varied."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner (upstairs) and once for brunch, and I can say that it is one of my favourite Montreal restaurants, especially in the Downtown/McGill area. The cuisine is both creative and delicious, not to mention beautifully plated.

As is usually the case with such restaurants, the menu changes constantly to reflect what is fresh and in season. Regardless of when you go though, you can rest assured that the food will be delicious.

For my most recent visit, which was for brunch, I had the crab and shrimp omelette with béarnaise sauce, which was absolutely decadent. They also inadvertently served me the mushroom and spring peas omelette, of which I had a bite, and it too was bursting with fresh spring flavors. Both were prepared with exquisite care. These were not your garden variety omelettes.

The ambiance here is very relaxed and casual, and the servers are very helpful in explaining everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Some of their pizza are simply amazing. But let's start with the entrées.  Took a tataki de bison which was really good. It had cheese, tomatoes and nuts with it and it was a perfect combination. We took 3 pizzas: an American (lobster), a mushroom (with truffle oil) and a piccante (spicy sausage). They were all good but the mushroom one was simply incredible. The truffle oil on the pizza was just the perfect quantity for a great taste. My second choice was the American one. In addition to the lobster, there's some horseradish that adds a little taste. The piccante was good but a spicy one is something you can have elsewhere.  We were three and in addition to the food listed here,  had a beere (total of 3) and took a wine bottle and it came to 145l4 with the tax. Average of 50$ per person with alcohol, which is reasonable. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. Pizza was incredible, but the pear pie with homemade ice cream was the big surprise. If it's on the menu, get it! I will go back anytime I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The pizza and appetizers are awesome. The pizza dough and sauce are both perfect ! The service is slow but other than that I have no complaints. Will be coming back for more pizza."}
{"text":"There used to be an old family-style Greek restaurant where Moleskine now stands. When the new owners moved in, they transformed the slightly tacky interior into an aerated, modern space with an industrial feel. Some details from the past remain: the original blue door, rough cement floor and parts of the ceiling/walls.  

We went to Moleskine early on a Friday evening. The restaurant was still empty, and from the front windows came a light breeze, mixing agreably with the subtle smell of wood fire. We shared an entrée (grilled zucchini salad with lemon and crushed pistachios), and each ordered a pizza (margherita and chanterelles/prosciutto). We were fooling around with the funny pencil dangling from the ceiling when the food came. The zucchini salad was like a summer dream. The lemon and pesto made it fresh and vibrant, the zucchinis were on the verge of being raw, and the ricotta added richness and density. The portion was relatively small, but left our tastebuds satisfied. 
The pizzas were served one after we finished the other, starting with the margherita. I hadn't asked for this, and was initially surprised we would not be served at the same time. Perhaps they knew that we would share? Anyways, it worked out great for us. Speaking of the pizzas, they were pretty much everything you could hope for. The margherita made the most of its simplicity. Although thin, the dough remained crispy at the bottom and delightfully moist on top. The second pizza was in my opinion even better than the first. It had the classic Italian combination of chanterelles and prosciutto, where the fattiness of the meat was counterbalanced by the fava beans, green peas and mint. Goat cheese was added on top of it all. 

After such a great meal, we sat for awhile at the windows of the restaurant, thinking that our neighbourhood was definitively getting better and better. Moleskine's first floor reminded me of Pizzeria No. 900, which I tried last week. Both places have a fancy pizza oven and are in the same price range, but I think that Moleskine's food is just that tad better - not only are the products amazing, the flavor combinations are bolder and better thought-out. 

Can't wait to try their other goods!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great music, great thin crust pizza coming out of the oven in front of your eyes. Sit at the little bar at the back so you can see the chefs work.  The entries are usually really good too, the root vegetable salad is exquisite. We usually get the gravlax too (4th time ordering it last night) but the one we had last didn't seem fresh and less work was put into presentation (half the ingredients missing) perhaps because McGill is on study break and we were one of the three couples dining in the restaurant that night. 

That being said the pizza is absolutely delicious and the place a must try! 
We will go again but probably not order the gravlax again"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place on their official day open I believe. 

The decor stays a five star. It's a beautiful restaurant. It's cool and trendy. It utilizes the space perfectly. The seating is comfortable. 
But I will ultimately give this place a 3. The food is delicious but the service was a bit rusty. Which makes sense because this was their opening. 

The cons:
Someone who came in after us got served before. There were no napkins on the tables. They forgot to punch in our order so our food took a little too long to get here. 
I felt like they overlooked us because we looked younger than other people there. I don't like that they judged us so quick. They basically dismissed us. 

The food:
I ordered the frittata and my boyfriend ordered a pizza. The portions were small for the price and we ended up having to go somewhere else because we were still hungry. 

The frittata was lovely though. Really tasty and fun to eat. There was a side salad and it was good except the dressing was a bit too sharp and sour for me. 

The pizza dough is perfect. And all the flavours work together. You can tell it was made with care and attention. It was fresh. 

Overall, an ok experience. The staff was nice and it's not a bad place to eat and talk."}
{"text":"A lively, vibrant place with a mixed clientele. I immediately liked it when I walked in. (I sat downstairs.) Unfortunately, the food is unremarkable. My tomato soup tasted as though it had come out of a can. The beet salad with chèvre sounded promising, but the taste was elusive (and very small). And everything came very slowly. A disappointing experience, especially at the price."}
{"text":"Small, cosy, intimate atmosphere. Friendly, helpful service. Good for 2 people as it's mostly bar style seating, a few tables for more. Wouldn't go as a large group. Delicious, well dressed and interesting salads. I LOVED our pizza - various mushroom and truffle. It was perfect; great thin crust, evenly and generously distributed toppings, great flavour. Loved the tastes, loved the vibes and will go back for sure. 
For 2 salads, a pizza and a fresh mint tea is was $70 with tax & tip; which I thought was a little on the pricey side but it wouldn't stop me from going again. Probably something to do with the location...so that's where the star is docked. I also cannot comment on the pizzas with tomato sauce - as ours didn't come with any - I'd be interested to know if it made the base soggy...next time. Overall, a big big thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Rude service and uncomfortable seating. Decided to give it a chance and have a glass of wine regardless and unfortunately the selection was limited. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Je n'ai testé que la partie du bas, mais je peux déjà dire que j'y ai goûté la meilleure pâte à pizza EVER! A égalité avec Prato peut-être. La déco est superbe et on a vite fait de s'amuser avec les crayons suspendus au plafond et les sets de table façon Scrabble. Le tataki de bison est à tomber, les autres entrées plutôt bien faites. J'ai beaucoup aimé la Margherita, mon mètre-étalon en termes de pizza, les autres garnitures un peu moins. Service en général attentif, parfois aléatoire. Jolie carte des vins, mais pourquoi servir dans des verres de cantine ? Petit bémol également, l'attente pour les pizzas (le resto était quasiment vide et nous étions 4 à table), il nous a fallu plus de 20 min pour que tout le monde soit servi"}
{"text":"Great place upstairs and downstairs although two very different menus. Great atmosphere and music! Only downside is the slow service! The staff is knowledgeable and polite but it took a while (both times we went) to get rid of our empty plates and be giving the bill. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 like before is that the service was the same, all 3 times I went...Slow.

{"text":"I was in the area attending a talk at McGill's New Residents Hall with my Mom and we got twitchy hungry after and needed to find a nice dinner option. I was so happy I chose to bring Mom to Moleskine!

We moseyed in and got seated close to the warm first pizza oven right away by the super kind and friendly staff. Everyone was chatty and accommodating and the vibe was lovely. I'd come back here on a date for sure, or with a friend, the lighting layout and decor were all welcoming and beautifully done and we loved listening to the old vinyl records while we waited for our food. 

And the food was great. I think you could have quite a fancy pricey meal here, but we just had a pizza each, thin and with awesome quality toppings and big enough for a couple slices of leftovers each. My mushroom and truffle oil pizza was heaven, and Mom loved her vegetarian so much she ordered another to bring to my sister. 

I have to admit, I think I subconsciously avoided this place because I find the name deeply unappetizing. I'm really glad I looked past it and got to have this lovely friendly delicious experience with my Mom."}
{"text":"Moleskine is between a three and four star for me. I liked the pizza, but it definitely is not the best in Montreal, especially for the price. That being said, it was pretty good quality and the wine list is good. The room and the atmosphere are casual, with good energy. 

Although I would recommend Moleskine for a casual dinner with some friends, it would not be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I ever had. Although is was a little pricey, it's worth the experience and yumminess !"}
{"text":"Suchhhhhh goooood pizzzaaaaaa my lord. It's  pricier than most places, but the pizza is worth it. It comes with a salad which to be frank was just okay, and the portion was tiny, but when the pizza came I totally got why. it's because youre gonna wanna stuff it all in your face. Service was a little too slow but they were also really busy. Big groups are a little harder to accommodate because the space is tight, but they managed to fit two big groups in there when I went. Décor matches the Avenue de Parc aesthetic, and it's in a really accessible spot if you're walking or commuting."}
{"text":"Do you remember or still experience your bets Sunday night dinner in the kitchen with your mom, dad, uncle etc? Well this was exactly what we experienced at Moleskine! My cousin came into town so we decided to try this out and it was exactly what we needed to have our intimate conversation. It's really cozy there. If you have personal space issues then this may not be for you BUT it is worth a try. It's a bit pricey but for a cute date night, it should be on your list. The food was delicious! Honestly it was a 5- star service. We sat right next to the kitchen (open space) and we not only got to experience the food and flavor, but we also got to experience and witness The chefs in their natural element and it was both a beautiful symphony and a lovely moment. Get prepared to spend a few hours eating good, talking and enjoying the time with your company because this place is it!"}
{"text":"Great place for a pizza and drink! I had an amazing cocktail while waiting for my pizza pie, and got to people watch while sitting at the (downstairs) window bar. 

The ambiance of the whole place is great  - dark and modern, with neat functional decor (the pencils)! Everyone was really friendly and helpful. 

The pizza itself is the reason for only 4 stars - while it was tasty, I was unable to eat it like a real pizza. Each time I tried to pick up a slice, the toppings would just slough off because the crust was so wet/weak. Still delicious when eaten with a fork, but less satisfying as pizza. I would visit again if in the area!"}
{"text":"My fiancé & dinned here for a casual lunch in Montreal nine months & still talk about the pizza. It was the best pizza we have ever had. Fresh ingredients & delicious crust. The space is industrial yet chic. Service was prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"I would add more stars if I could - this was beyond a 5 star experience!

Charles (our exceptional server) really created an absolutely memorable dining experience!

You could just say this is a high end pizza place but embrace a culinary experience here and don't let the brief menu here deter you - portions are small and this place is best enjoyed tapas style starting with a few appetizers (yes a few even if you are dining alone or as a couple and ask for them one at a time) - if you come with friends just order one of each of the appetizers and have them serve in sequence you will each get one amazing bite that will leave you craving more. 

Start with the amazingly delicious zucchini salad with ricotta and pistachios with a delectable (perhaps shallot?)  infused vinengarette.  Certainly one of my favorite dishes of the night - not to be missed. 

Next the sashimi style sea trout (kinda like salmon) (just 3 pieces or so)   delivers some interesting contrasts within the dish  that includes grapefruit and an absolutely delicious marinated grated fennel. 

Then a absolute must try is the beef appetizer  - it's very very finely sliced carpaccio style beef with a wonderful high grade parmesan and nuts with a balsamic reduction. 

Charles recommended a wonderful light but peppery French red that for the quality and taste was refreshingly inexpensive ($45 bottle). It was absolutely wonderful pairing with the food!!

We then had a simple margarite pizza - usually I like more ingredients on my pizza but Charles recommended this simple pizza as a end to the main meal because of its simplicity and it was a perfect call. Light delicious tomato sauce, high quality cheese and a very thin and wonderfully artisanal crust. 

Don't miss the dessert here - order the chocolate flourless offering - again a culinary masterpiece of flavor and textures - a perfect ending to a perfect evening!!"}
{"text":"Situated close to McGill, the place offers some incredible soft-crust pizzas. The interior is cozy and the open kitchen is fun to watch. Besides their delicious pizzas, they also offer a range of dishes including duck and grilled fish. :)"}
{"text":"This place will continue to be one of my favorites. The menu changes frequently and will vary from the first to the second floor, so it's quite hard to grow bored of this restaurant. You have the pleasure of choosing depending on your craving. As expected, this place is high in demand on weekends and during summer. So be sure to reserve. For those who are vegan, don't be shy to mention it and they will accommodate. Small note, you can ask for the upstairs menu at the bottom and vice versa. *wink wink*"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new pizza place on du parc street. I eneded up here with my supervisor for a work lunch. The place has a rustic charm, old-fashioned style with open kitchen. You can observe the chefs making your pizza while you wait for your order. Their pizzas are exclusive, each order comes with a side of salad. I really enjoyed the lunch. The service is okay too. Definitely would go there again when I want to have a deliciuos pizza experience."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour l'anniversaire d'un ami en soirée vers 21h. Le restaurant à 2 étages. Le premier étage sert de la pizza gourmet cuit au four de bois et le 2ieme étage ils ont un différent menu à la carte. Au premier c'est plus bruyant. Le 2ieme c'est plus intime et à mon avis, plus agréable.

La menu n'est pas très grand mais on y trouve de bonnes options italienne. Pour ma part j'ai mangé la pieuvre, c'était vraiment délicieux.  Vraiment une endroit où je retournerais sans hésiter."}
{"text":"We are in our 50s, Yanks and love Canada. We were a little apprehensive when we walked in as it was a very eclectic vibe. We soon took in the vibe and found it also creative, interesting and fun. 
Lobster Forzetti was fabulous with shaved fennel, pancetta  and delightful sauce with big chunks of lobster.
The lamb was prepared three ways and again the sauces were absolutely fabulous.
We noticed the individual preparing salads was not wearing gloves and at one point took a handful of nuts he was chopping, ate them, then proceeded to plate a salad using the same hand.  This didn't sit well with us. Otherwise, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I first read about this restaurant on eater and I really wanted to like it but it was so mediocre. Pizza is my favorite dish so you can understand why I was so excited to try this place. Plus the reviews on yelp are so good that my expectations were high. It definitely did not live up to my expectations. 

My aunt and I shared the pizza of the day and the Mornay. The pizza of the day had corn and chorizo. The Mornay had mushrooms and cheese. First of all the pizzas were not very warm. Also we sat next to the window and it was so cold. Second, the pizzas were super thin! I like thin crust pizza but this was almost too thin. Third, its not cheap! It is not worth the $18-$19 that we paid. If you want thin crust wood fire pizza go to il focolaio!! It's the best!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant is packed with personality. Between the music and decour this was one of the most interesting places I've dined at. The pizza was very good, and the service was beyond exceptional."}
{"text":"Le petit frère du Pullman est arrivé, bienvenue au Moleskine ! Ambiance sympa et relax, nous étions assis au comptoir en bas avec vue sur la cuisine. Déco moderne. Les crayons qui sont suspendus au plafond sont originaux. Les vin en fût n'étaient pas encore arrivés/installés lors de notre visite (ça faisait juste 1 semaine que c'était ouvert). J'ai commencé avec une bière Charles-Henri (6$), grignotines popcorn (3$), on a poursuivis avec l'entrée de saumon / pamplemousse / fenouil / menthe (14$), délicieuse et fraîche, j'ai continué avec un verre de vin Aglianico Ocone (9$), il est servit dans un petit bécher. La spécialité du Moleskine est la pizza, avons donc optés pour la  pizza salciccia (17$), succulente pizza. Comme dessert, avons pris une crème glacée/sundae cerises au sirop (9$), bonne et très cochon. Le serveur était très aimable et serviable. Prix raisonnables. On y retournera pour sûr lorsque les vins en fût seront là, ainsi que de goûter à une autre de leur bonnes pizzas.

4/5 visité en mai 2016"}
{"text":"Maybe this is Canadian pizza. The crust was so thin and uncrispy that the toppings just slid right off. The service and atmosphere were great but I can't get past the crust."}
{"text":"J'ai bcp aimé l'ambiance , la cuisine visible au milieu, les lumieres tamisées, le gout de la pizza fraiche mais moins le choix de musique de radio.. je retournerais certainement pour la pizza et l'ambiance :)"}
{"text":"so this is a place that i had been meaning to stop at forever 

i kept forgetting it was pizza so every time i decided to go and saw that was what was on the menu i decided against it

then i finally took the plunge and i was happy i did

limited menu with a couple of specials thrown in for good measure

i am very hard to please as far as pizza goes and this is one i enjoyed immensely

hipster ambiance which i would normally poohpooh but i am a woman of a certain age and do love listening to vinyl just like when i was young

loved the decor but the pizza was the star"}
