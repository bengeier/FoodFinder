{"text":"We came for my nephew's recent marriage. The place was very packed as it's apparently the popular place during spring training. Hubby ordered steak. It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality. The guy did remove my hubby's steak dinner from the bill so that was good and we appreciated that. We did pay fifteen dollars for the baked potato and my side salad (our table had 18% gratuity added) but I was grateful to not have to pay for his entree."}
{"text":"I was taken to this restaurant as a \"must see\" place during a business trip. The first 5 seconds of the experience was negative as I was very put off by the poor cow that was eating grass heartily by the entrance to this steak house. The restaurant was a good size but finding a table didn't require a reservation on a Monday night around 8:30. 

Also, if you don't like kids, this should be the last place for a choice of dining for you. There was a slide *in* the restaurant. A mob of kids were screaming and running around wild when we came in.

We got a seat by the window, which had a beautiful view of downtown Phoenix. But the service was painfully slow. We had to look around and flag down a server... any server everytime... from ordering to a refill to asking for the check... 

One look at the menu.. and again, I was disgusted with the \"fried rattle snake\" listed under appetizers. The food was \"eh\", but not great. 

Oh and they had a live county music band...which added to the deafening noise from the kids.

The exit was separate from the entrance so the jury is still out on whether the cow was still up and eating by the time we left. Not to mention the gross display of dead rattlesnakes on the right side of the exit.

If you don't mind seeing your meal alive before you sit down... or better yet, seeing dead snakes around, I still say go at least once.. just for the bizarre experience.."}
{"text":"Can I give this place like 100 stars?!?! The western atmosphere is FUN for the whole family, the food is great, you get a ton annnnnd they have fried rattlesnake (haven't tried it yet, but it is on my to-do). This is my \"bring the out-of-towners\" place. The views are spectacular, too!"}
{"text":"**Buyer Beware**. If you plan to make a reservation, don't expect to be seated at the time you reserve.  When we reached the the hostess, she informed us that it would be 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great for groups with live entertainment and wholesome food. They can handle huge groups and do a wonderful job with a chuck wagon meny. Also a fun place to take out of town guests with kids."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely location and a great atmosphere. Their food, however, is tasteless and over priced. My family and went there twice, the second time to try different dishes to see if they were better but nope. I like the place enough that I'd probably be back for drinks or appetizers, but I've given up on dinner there. Sorry, please fix up that menu!"}
{"text":"We were from out of town, and this was the best restaurant we hit all trip. The dining experience starts off with a quick hello to the huge cow outside the restaurant. Once inside, after checking in, you are guided to a slide you can go down to enter the downstairs/eating area of the restaurant. There's also stairs, but the slide was fun :) all the staff is dressed in cowboy attire, which is cool. We go an awesome table at the window with an awesome view. Our dinner started with a bang...
1. bread/butter: they brought it out, Indian fry bread (which is SOO yummy) and biscuits, which are also great. there's a normal butter and a delicious cinnamon butter, or honey to top it off with. 
2. salad! it had a lot of dressing but it was good. served family style 
3. THEN we ordered... among my whole family, we were able to try a lot of foods.. I got the grilled chicken and I loved it! bbq'd to perfection with great sauce. the corn was great, and my family was all very happy with their meals too (ribs, shrimp, etc). overall awesome food. 
4. finally they brought out complimentary cotton candy! it was funny to get, and you can't go wrong with cotton candy. 

just remember..
- Come early or make reservations! (We tried to go on a Monday night during spring break, around 6:15 pm and there was a 45 minute wait. We made reservations for Thursday at 5:30 and it wasn't crowded, but I'd still say reservations are a safe bet, or arrive early!)
- Parking will likely be full in the upper lot, unless you want valet parking, the lower lot is good. there's a shuttle that goes up and down too, but it's a quick and easy walk too. 
- It can be loud, if they have a band playing. 

Quirks we loved:
- the cow outside
- the slide
- the views
- the Indian fry bread
- cinnamon butter
- the cotton candy 

Overall it was an awesome experience and had super BBQ. Great family restaurant, fun time, amazing view... loved it all!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.

One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.

My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.

If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, view. could have better beer selection. new york strip and ribeye were delicious! courtesy warning: rattle snake appetizer only 2 oz of rattle snake to 6 oz of prickly pear for $21!"}
{"text":"Use to love this place. Use to! Not busy Friday night and now I may know why. Ordered a filet and was tasteless. Server reordered it and had it chard. Took forever, our table was almost done eating. STILL NO FLAVOR! .......REALLY!!  This is a steak house for Pete sake. Spend some money on a salt and pepper shaker. Sister and spouse tried it too and agreed. Manager said they season with salt and pepper and are usually heavy on that, then followed up with \"a filet usually has little flavor\". Huh?? Asked him to try it but he refused. But just continued to argue the point but would not try it. He Just liked to continue to say I was wrong. So I was done! Sooooo done! And manager did nothing to make it right I mean NOTHING! But he got out of there quick. Maybe he was not the manager!  Just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill. So after we left our party. We went back to our hotel the Wild Horse Pass Resort so I could eat something. I was so starving since I had only bread and my husband sat and watched. REAL FUN NIGHT!!! So maybe the General Manager should call us if they care."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome. View is one-of-a-kind. Service isn't bad. Food SUCKS! Been here two times recently right when it opened for dinner, and both times the food was terrible. For being one of the first tables to get food you would think it would be fresh. Nope! The salad is iceberg lettuce out of a bag with cucumbers that had to be cut days ago. The $21 Filet was tough and fatty with no flavor. Blah! The experience is great, but only if you're coming for dessert. The \"cow pie\" dessert was great. That's IT! :("}
{"text":"Two stars for the view and ambience.  I ordered the half slab of pork ribs and they were not good.  Way overcooked and dried out.  My husband had a burger as did his brother.  That was pretty good.  The prime rib my sister in law had was so so.  The salad starter was good as were the cowboy beans.  The corn on the cob was a soggy overcooked mess.  The potatoes were not done correctly (some overcooked, some undercooked) and the veggie mix was just ok.  

The beer was ice cold and yummy and the slide was fun!

Loved the complimentary cotton candy for dessert!  We had to ask for it though.  

So, go for the view, the beer, a burger and some cotton candy."}
{"text":"We dined here for dinner with a large group while visiting Phoenix over Memorial Day Weekend...

PROS:
-Awesome view of all of Phoenix, like super awesome view.
-Ambiance, the place is decorated to the 9's in complete western and country swag. There is a live country band playing music on stage, a dance floor, livestock, and just a cool floor plan overall. 
-Kid/ Family friendly, including a slide for the kids to play on all night as well as an arcade area
-Separate bar and dining area, was able to accommodate our large crowd of 30+.

CONS:
-Staff, not very attentive, I understand we had a large group, but you also had notice of our reservation... staff up.
-Food, nothing special. It was by no means bad, but for these prices I've had way better. The free biscuits and cinnamon butter were the best thing I ate all night.
-Lack of vegetables or other alternatives on the menu, although I am a proud and happy meat eater, this would NOT be the place for your vegetarian friends, or friends that prefer to have some greens.
-Waitressing staff at the end of the night went back and forth for what seemed like an hour, on whether or not they could split the check. Either way, we just wanted to go home. She finally split is by table and comes up and tells us, \"so these aren't 100% accurate but this is what it's supposed to cost.\" I kid you not. She charged us for what she \"thought\" the bill was supposed to be rather than what we actually ordered. Major fail. 

Clearly the cons outweigh the pros. If you're going here for the food, don't. If you're going here because you want an awesome view and atmosphere and you don't mind the mediocre food and service, just know what's in store for you and your party. From the other reviews on here it doesn't look much different if you're a party of 2 or a group of 30+."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Terrible food, terrible service. 
We went to the Rooste last September when we were staying at the Grand for my husband's birthday and were disappointed from the moment we walked in. We went to the hostess stand and stood there for 3 minutes (I timed it) before one of the four hostesses even looked up to acknowledge us. The girl that helped us acted like she was doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. It was a busy saturday night, so we had to wait a bit for a table. No problem, because we could grab a drink at the bar and then let our kids go down the slide a few hundred times. 
We get to the table, order from a very nice but stressed out waitress. After much more endless sitting and waiting, and joking with the table next to us about the ridiculous wait, our food gets dropped off by a food runner. Not dropped off to our table, mind you, but the runner puts the tray of food on a stand nearby, and tells us that our waitress will be by to serve us momentarily. After more waiting, we served ourselves, ate, and put our dirty dishes back on the serving tray before our waitress came around to see us again. Glad we didn't wait to be served. The food was airline-quality. We both ordered the steak and enchiladas (a weird combo to offer but it sounded good at the time). I could have easily made something better at home. Maybe the point of having you wait for so long for your food is to make you starving enough to choke it down. 
We were so over the whole experience by that point that we asked for the manager. What a mistake. Most managers in a customer service setting are cordial to the customers and care about their business. Not this guy. He stormed over to our table and practically yelled that they were very busy that night, and we should be more patient. We hadn't even explained our issue by that point. As my husband tried to explain the numerous issues that we had encountered from the rude hostesses down to the nonexistent waitress, the manager seemed to get angry with us and again told us to be more patient. To which my husband replied \"Are you f***ing kidding me?\" Well, that didn't sit well with the manager, who said he wouldn't even speak to us further if we were going to cuss at him. I took over and asked us how he would feel if he were in our shoes. How he expects to be treated at a restaurant, and what kind of service he expects when he dines out. He simply said that they were just too busy that night and there was nothing he could do to help us. We weren't asking for anything, we were just trying to make him aware of all of the issues that we had encountered so he and his staff could try to improve. 
I've had poor service at other restaurants, but I've never had a restaurant manager act like such a jerk. It's no wonder that place has such bad reviews. It's terribly run, and the food is terrible. The only thing it has going for it is the slide and the view. 
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Its a long haul to south side of Phoenix by South Mountain but is was worth it . Great views from patio or even from inside dining . My T-bone was excellent as was all of our groups food . Great atmosphere  inside and out with good service  Place was packed  and   people were having a great time into the evening as sun set in the west ."}
{"text":"The view was nice and the coin magician was an added enjoyment.  UNFORTUNATELY,  the begging waiting no reservation process was difficult.   The snake bites lacked flavor. With a party of 8 and the complete sampler platter, the quality of the food was VERY POOR !  Dry beef, low end salad.  The restaurant provides a fun atmosphere but our adult guests were hungry and felt that the food lacked in every way.  So if you just want to kill both money and time....this will do it !   It was much better years ago but now they have allowed the quality to deminish.  I am hoping management reads this and makes a serious improvement. ...food quality for a 2 hour meal would be appreciated. .   This is the only review I have ever written. ..but I can't apologize more to my 7 guests that I convinced to dine there...:(..."}
{"text":"Loved our sever Kyle Perkins please ask for him when you come.
Every thing was good but steaks while cooked to the right temperature had no flavor"}
{"text":"Wow if you want to go to a western restaurant that serves excellent food with a gorgeous scenery, this is the place.  Everywhere you look there was eye candy!  There are tons of rattlesnake souvenir's to purchase, the slide was a lot of fun going down (the menu tells you why they had one --  it was used as an escape route back in the days), the lights used pans, they used jars for cups, people dressed up, a band, your appetizer plate was a small aluminum plate, etc, and etc.  It was FANTASTIC!  :D 

This place is pricy and reservations are highly recommended at a weekend night.  The rattlesnake appetizer was good.  With the cucumber sauce, it.. tastes.. like... chicken, lol.  But I was brave and I tried it and I liked it!!  I highly recommend coming here for the experience and to try rattlesnake!! :)

One side comment, the bull outside the restaurant needs a friend.  I think he's lonely."}
{"text":"The best! Never had such a steak. A real event! Live Country music, reasonable pricing and the great view over Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"This is a place that I would NOT recommend to anyone. Upon arrival we waited for 5 minutes just for the hostess to acknowledge our presence. She took us to a table against the rear wall when most of the tables by the window were open. She left us standing there while she returned to the hostess podium. We were finally seated at a window table. We waited 10 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks and our entrees. Five minutes later our server bring out a bowl of salad and some bread. The bread had a burnt taste to it and it was not able to be covered up by the butter. We served ourselves salad and tried to decide if there was any dressing on it or not. If there was any dressing it was so little than it definitely didn't touch every piece of lettuce and it was very bland...basically tasteless .My guest had ordered a filet mignon done medium rare. When he received it, the meat was so tough that he could barely stick his fork in it. Another 10 minutes trying to find a server...finally got a server and explained the problem...ok several minutes later he brings another piece of meat that isn't much better than the first but he manages to eat it. I ordered the prime rib medium rare but by the time I received it...ice cold! The vegetables that were served were overcooked and pretty tasteless.  The one redeeming quality of this place is the view but good dinner should be a part of it.
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"The meal was not fresh.  We ordered the Cowboy Stuff and most of the meal seemed to have been cooking all day.  The bbq chicken was dry and tough to eat.  The ribs were also dry.  Both of the kabobs were much better than the rest of the meal.  Even the garnish and cru de te was old.  The lettuce garnish was dried out crispy, the radishes were soft and mealy, and the celery was soft and bendable.

I would not recommend this dish at the end of the day."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix recently on business and was taken here by my boss with a big group of people. I thought it was pretty neat for the atmosphere with a big long horn outside, the crazy decor, a live band playing country tunes, a big slide for kiddies to goof off on. I could go on and on, the place is just neat in a silly sort of way.

The food was sort of meh. We ordered the rattle snack appetizer which tasted like fried (insert whatever here). I would have to like to have found out what rattlesnake really tasted like, I already know what fried (insert whatever here) tastes like thank you very much. The stuff was like 20 something dollars too, phew glad that work was picking up the tab!

For my entree I had the rib steak. It's wasn't very good quality but it was passable. I thought a place like this would have had better quality steaks though.

The place is pretty cool though. If I ever find myself back in Phoenix with my family I would bring them here because the place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Horrible fat filled steak. Carrots were under seasoned. Beans and fried mushrooms were good. Corn mushy and over cooked. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Perfect for tourists who want the \"Old West Cowboy\" theme...decor is cheesy, honky-tonk style, right down to the live Longhorn penned up at the entrance to the restaurant. There was a live country band when we visited which was fun. The food is hit or miss, some of our steaks were cooked perfectly and others were overcooked. They serve a big bowl of iceberg lettuce salad family style with a tiny bit of dressing already on it. Mixed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) were served with our steaks as well as a small corn on the cob. Baked potatoes or fries are an extra charge. Skip dessert (especially the apple pie with the toughest crust you'll ever put your fork in)."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for dinner. But the next time my boss is in town we'll go somewhere else.
The appetizer was nothing fancy. Nachos with beef.  Not very flavorful or extravagent.  We both ordered steaks.  Any modification to the standard issue of sides was an additional cost or not available.  It reminded me of Black Angus.  Sure, it's a sight to see with the live bull outside and I'll bet the place rocks for the C&W crowd.  But steakwise I would suggest BobbyQ's everytime.  
$100 dollar for dinner for 2 without alcohol."}
{"text":"My family enjoys coming here occasionally. The food is good but the seating is cramped and the noise level is too high. The building is awesome so it is a cool experience for first timers, so we like to bring visitors here but it is not a good setting for having good conversations if the band is playing. If you get to sit by the windows the veiw is pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a venerable Phoenix tradition.

Many people have come here and had a great time.

I last came here for an event with former students from my college, so my experience is probably atypical.

Our event was part update on whats happening on campus, part memorial, and quite traditional.  We do it every year.  This was perhaps, the wrong venue for us.  We did not have the solemn atmosphere that the memorial part of the event demands, and the other groups around us were having so much fun that I could barely hear the speaker.

No wait staff were required for our group, so I can't tell what service might be like as a regular diner.  Our meal was a buffet style bbq chicken dinner, which I probably would avoid if I could. It was a bit overdone, to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans (bland), corn (waterlogged cobbettes), rolls (good for crumbs, but not much else), and the afterthought salad.

If I didn't know that much of my fee was going to scholarships, I'd think that I got ripped off."}
{"text":"One of the most overrated steak houses I've ever been to.  I had the bone in aged ribeye....all gristle and chewy.  It was almost inedible.  Long waits to get a table and definitely not worth the price. 
I give it two stars because the bread is good and so is their cookie desert."}
{"text":"We had dinner at RR last night and it was the worst food I've had in a long long time.  From the time we arrived til we left the only thing we enjoyed was the view.  When we arrived, we had to stand at the hostess stand for a few minutes while three hostesses talked a among themselves-they never even looked up.  Once we were seated, it was soooo dark in there, we had to get our phone flashlights out to see the menu and the again to see if the steaks were cooked correctly. Out of 4 steaks ordered only one was cooked correctly and all four were luke warm. The veggies on the plate were cold (the butter would not even melt on the corn).  Everything seemed like it sat in the kitchen for a long time before being served.  My steak was really tough and I watched everyone pouring salt on the food trying to find some flavor.  We had brought out of town guests with us who were buying us dinner and I didn't want to complain in front of them so I excused myself to find our waitress.  I told her about the food and that was the last we heard about it.  Go there for the view and a drink.  EAT ELSEWHERE"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this place after golfing one Sunday. We arrived at 4:30 thru the strong smell of cowdung and respected the sign that told us to sit in the bar until they opened the restaurant at 5. As we sat uncomfortably, we watched three groups of people be seated in the restaurant. My husband asked the hostess why they were allowed to be seated and was told they must be friends of the wait staff. Well. all right then. We finally got seated and soon realized we should have simply left at that point. Our server was as close to useless as one can get. We learned most of what we needed to know by eavesdropping on a competent one at the table beside us. Then our food began to arrive. The buns were good, the salad mediocre and the \"grill mix\" so bad we barely ate any. The tenderloin was not tenderloin at all, the ribs were a strange red colour and smothered in a barbque sauce that returned to us over and over all night long and the swordfish scared me so badly I chose not to eat more than the first taste. We also had a side of mashed potatoes that were gritty and watery. On top of everything else, all the food  was so highly salted, we thought it should be declared a deadly weapon. We declined dessert and the cotton candy as we were just wanting out at that point. We did not stay for the music. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"worst place ever!! food is inedible, facility old and dirty, service under par.  nothing good about it except for the city view.  we ordered a vareity of food and EVERYTHING tasted awful - chemical and preservative laden, over salted, bland, dry, no flavor.  how this place can stay in business is beyond me.  never returning!"}
{"text":"The first time I ever went here (possibly three to four years ago) I thought the steak was the best I ever had.  This time, just average.  Background:  This is definately now a theme restaurant, complete with a slide, loud ambiance, smelly bull outside, all sitting on a hill with a great view.  My steak was good, not great, it was hard to hear my coworker inside, and it must have been everyone's birthday, there was a clatter each time.  I can recommend going here for a family, or for a group of people, it's very large inside.  It's not as special to me as the first time I visited."}
{"text":"More of a tourist attraction.  Food is better elsewhere for the cost."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here and thought it would be a good experience but we were sorely disappointed.  I ordered a steak and asked for medium well.  The first steak came out rare so I sent it back.  The second steak came back rare.  The third time was the charm, but the steak was dry after being reheated.  The manager brought the steak out and I thought he would offer to comp my meal, but he muttered a weak apology and there was no adjustment to our bill.  The only reason to go to this restaurant is for the view."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but food was below average. Had Hines in my turkey dinner. Food was cold when served had to ask for it to be heated up.

View is amazing
Food is over priced for quality
Employees were great"}
{"text":"The attitude of the staff was unlike anything I have experienced in this area.  And I don't mean good!  We  were met with by a rude hostess who directed us to the bar where we waited 20 for a drink.  There were 5 other tables - all of whom seemed to be getting attention.  We returned to the hostess when the restaurant dining opened and were told to pay our bar tab and wait by the railing.  We did that.  We requested outside seating, but were told by the hostess that she \"didn't have her sheet yet\".  Not sure what that meant, but we were not seated at any of the many open tables outside.  Several parties were seated out there  as we dined inside and watched.  We also sat and watched as all the tables around us were served bread, but we did not get a bread basket until we were 1/2 way through our entrees.  Two people in our party of 6 were brought the wrong meals, so rather than giving them the option of eating the mistake or waiting for the correct meal, the incorrect meals were whisked away..  We were told we could only put  everything on one check....which is ridiculous! They seemed kind of angry that we even suggested  a check for each couple.  The food was  ok but  sub par compared to other restaurants .  If you want to see the view, drive up and take a look, but skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"Jus went to Rustler's Rooste last night.  Party of 4 on a Wednesday night.  No wait to be seated.  They had a live band which was nice but also made it hard to hear each other at the table.  All 4 of us had \"a little of this, a little of that\" which was 2 fillet medallions plus your choice of shrimp, swordfish or 1/2 rack of pork ribs.  Between the 4 of us we had every combination.  The meat comes with corn on the cob and either rice pilaf or green beans depending on your add-on meat choice.  Baked potatoes are extra $2.  Salad is included with the meal, but no choices of dressing.  It came pre-tossed with a ranch dressing.  It wasn't very good.  They bring baskets of rolls and biscuits.  They were ok, not nearly as god as Texas Roadhouse.  Our entrees were good and the view was beautiful.  The ambience was very nice other than being a little loud and we would definitely go back again.  We each had 2 beers and our total bill was $150 for 4 people."}
{"text":"Had better steak in the lunch room at high school. Really disappointing as I'd heard rave reviews about the place. Almost booked a company dinner for 500 here too!

Got the T bone steak which comes with flavorless sliced carrots and corn on the cob. Also tried the rattlesnake as an appetizer. It was tasteless and way over cooked and way over priced. 

Only reason I gave the RR a 2 star
Rating is for their beer. Big and cold!

Save you're money folks....you can get a way better meal just about anywhere in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"View was awesome, atmosphere very fun but loud. Steak was great , but the salad was pretty bad and the side of carrots and beans did not justify the price. I would still recommend the trip but just once."}
{"text":"Food was poor. Nachos were burnt. Waited 50 minutes for check. 1 star is generous. Not sure but I think the ribs were coyote."}
{"text":"Decided to make a reservation  a week early for MOTHER'S DAY.

My Mom brought this place up because of the great view. I called and asked the young lady on the phone if anything was going on for the Mother's Day, and that I preferred an 11 am. She replied that the restaurant didn't even open until 4pm and 4pm was the earliest we could come in EVEN ON AN THIS SPECIAL DAY. Hmmmm okay fine, since my Mother loves the view , I told the hostess , alright if that is the earliest you guys open for MOTHER'S day put me down for 4pm right when you guys open.

My family and I sat at home, anxious for a yummy dinner! Waiting for 4 pm!


Now the four of us show up, I approach the hostess, without receiving eye contact I inform her we have a reservation, she says (while looking down) \"name?\" I reply with my name and she looks up and says \" Alright, move to railing and a host will come grab you\" No smile. No greeting. Not even in a nice tone! I think to myself, it is fine, I am not going to acknowledge this, I am here for  my Mom and I do not want to ruin the mood.

We are led to a SMALL table. Great view. TINY table. Oh and ALL booths are EMPTY.  

My boyfriend is very tall, therefore he goes back to the host and asks for a booth, IN A SASSY manor replies to him that those are only for guests of 5 or more. 

He comes back saying we can't move. HUH!? Our salad and bread comes out and now his legs are hanging out and the food wont even fit.

My sister gets a manager , THEN we are able to move. Unbelievable !!!!

We get our drinks, And the waiter explains he has been on the clock since 9 am...


UM WHAT!? YOU GUYS WERE OPEN?!

AFTER BEING TOLD ABOUT THE MIMOSAS AND OMELET BAR I AM PISSED! MY poor mother is bummed!

We order food, it literally comes out in about ten minutes FASTEST food I have ever gotten brought out. I assume it is not fresh. Literally in ten mins everything was out. 

The bill came out to $140.00 for four. I tipped our server generously. 

The Brunch was $34.95 with a buffet AND MIMOSAS. 

Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Very interesting looking place. Very rustic, cowboy type theme, great atmosphere, great service, and a great place to go with a bunch of friends or on a date. A good culinary experience."}
{"text":"Can't believe people are giving high ratings to this place.  Rustlers Rooste was a huge disappointment compared to the past visits.  We waited 45 minutes for a table when sitting in the bar and saw no less than 8 tables empty for 20 minutes and not being bused. They were intentionally making people wait to make the place seem busier.  When i checked on our table the hostess checked the time we arrived then her clock and told me we had 15 minutes more to wait.  She never once looked at how many were in front of us making it clear there was a prescribed wait time and it didnt have anything to do with how busy they were. From our point in the bar we watched in amazement as one of the hostess staff kept pulling a burger and fries from a cupboard to eat while people were waiting to be seated! The fry bread and salad came quickly but then it took forever to get our meals we had to ask twice for a second drink.  When our food did finally come it was just okay.  The burger looked the best but the ribs one of our party ordered was disappointing and the \"steak\" fries were really only one potato cut in four wedges and deep fried - they were just terrible.  And did I mention the forced cheerful cowboy ya'll of our server?  It was clearly faked and odd.

The view is great and the place is fun for kids under 10. That's the only reason i didn't give it a 1."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I wanted this to be a great restaurant....I really did.  However, contrary to my wishes, Rustler's Roost was a grand ole disappointment.  The bull on the way in was probably the best part of the whole experience, though he did look slightly mortified to be seen in such an establishment.  First off, the place is huge and filllllled with kids, which I was willing to accept.  We sit down and immediately order beers and snake.  The snake comes out ASAP, but instead of reveling in a new tasty delicacy, I am confronted with some room temperature, chewy pieces of a once noble creature.  Oh well.  Then some fry bread, biscuits and salad.  The butter was odd tasting (the reg one, not the cinnamon one), the biscuits were incredibly dry and tasteless (how the hell did they manage to pull that off?) and the fry bread had seen better days.   On to the meal...I ordered BBQ pork ribs.  I took my first bite, and bingo!!!!!!!!  I got a prize.  I reached into my mouth, to extract it from my teeth, and I pulled out a lovely blonde hair (I happen to be of the brunette persuasion).   That was the straw (hair) that broke the camel's back.  We immediately called for the bill and told her to remove our entrees, which she did.  Then, the icing on the cake...the dude busing the table had the balls to say to us...:Better luck next time\".  I called him a douche bag, and went on my merry way.  The only thing this placed rustled up was my disdain and a bad yelp review."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait for a table on weekends- but it's so worth it! You can hang in the bar while you wait.  If you have to park in the bottom parking lot= just wait for the shuttle because it's a steep climb up.  SHINER BOCK on tap!!!!!!!!!!!!! served in mason jars. First you get a big basket of fry bread with cinnamon butter. Don't bother with the rattlesnake app- unless you have $20 to burn. Then you get a huge bowl of house salad. It's very addicting due to the saturation of ranch dressing. Steak and enchiladas were phenomenal. Very fun atmosphere- go ahead and get loud. Never had so much fun at a restaurant before"}
{"text":"Coming to rustler rooste since I was a kid tonight shows why they use to be a great place to eat. Ribs were stringy & season badly also had a tbone it was chewy & tough was suppose to be medium, was almost well done. My sons burger was burnt, greasy & disgusting that a 12 year old boy wouldn't even finish it.  Still they got one of the best views in phoenix just wish the food was as good."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants! On top of the hill w/ a great view of the city. I think the best bargain is the Cowboy platter. For about $20 a person, you get ribs, steak, chicken, fish, fries, corn, and sides. Plenty of leftovers since you will be snacking on the Indian fry bread. The staff are always friendly and service is fast.

There is live entertainment and very family friendly. A great place to take out of town visitors.

I recommend making reservations if you want to sit by the window which has the best view."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town guest. Also apparently for birthdays. Nice view, fast little slide, big bull, country music live band, and cold beer in a jar. Steaks are prepared perfect, tender and flavorful. I tried the cheese enchiladas, very good. Beans are BBQ sweet. Chicken came with sause on side. I like it cooked into it, but it was good. They have generous portions and friendly people. A fun crowd."}
{"text":"Located up on a hill with an excellent view at dusk of planes circling for landing at the Phoenix airport, Rustler's Rooste is my choice for rattlesnake. Why? Because it comes with the snake's deep-fried SKELETON! 
I give it 3 stars because although it is a superb spot with unique food and even a slide (embarrassing or fun, you decide), the decor is overboard western kitsch. The hanging skins and taxidermied snakes are ummm...ok in smaller doses. Plainly put, it's not a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant, but the rattlesnake was mouth-watering."}
{"text":"We waited an hour to be seated. Once seated, we waited 20 minutes before I finally decided to ask when our waiter would be taking our order. We waited for nearly an hour for our food. When our food did come, it was cold. Yes, cold steak. The mashed potatoes were hot, but that was the only thing hot in our meal. I was really disappointed and I was so looking forward to new years Eve dinner 2015 making a happy memory... The plus side? We did get a table by the window and the view was great. I don't feel that they had enough help to accommodate the crowd and the service wasn't adequate."}
{"text":"they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse"}
{"text":"This place is super cute. The slide is a blast for kids! The food is alright. Just alright. The service is not good at all. We came for my best friend's birthday and upon arrival we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. We asked if we could sit in the bar area to order a drink and we were told we could order drinks and appetizers while we waited. So we ordered some snacks and drinks. We were hungry! About three minutes later they said our table was ready! We wouldn't have ordered all the snacks if we'd known the wait would only be three minutes! We asked the server what happened and she was rude and dismissive. Totally not apologetic. The service in general was unappreciative and smug. Definitely didn't feel appreciated at all. We ordered dessert to go and they didn't give us napkins or utensils. Bummer."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Went on a Sunday evening to celebrate my son's HS graduation.  7 adults and 3 children were there. Ordered the rattlesnake for my son and I and got maybe 6 nuggets.  At $18/plate, we got short changed.  I ordered the 1/2 BBQ chicken.  The corn on the cob looked liked it was sitting in water all day, but thinking it was from Saturday nite.  The waiter brought back 2 more corn on the cobs and still looked the same.  I looked at him and said \"Really?\"  The broccoli was raw.  The chicken looked like it was cooked last nite and finally got fed up with this BS service and food.  The manager came by and asked what the problems were and I told him that he should be ashamed of himself putting out crap.  He told me that he would check into it.  Never came back.  Should have gotten monetary compensation.  

I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN THAT DUMP AGAIN."}
{"text":"The Good: ambiance - there's a live bull in a corral at the entrance, a walkway created from the side of the mountain, a slide to go down to the dining area, live band, great drinks although serving size is small.  

The Bad:  food - the salad comes pre-made with ranch dressing.  The lettuce is wilted because it's been sitting at a serving station drenched in ranch making it soggy.  It wouldn't be like that if they'd put the dressing on the side or put the dressing on right before they serve it.  The carrots are overcooked.  I had the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye.  Their seasoning is lacking and the steak was bland.  

This is a great place if you've got kids since their kids menu looked good plus they serve complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  It's good for a drinking crowd and tourists too, just stay away from the steaks.  You'll have spent your money more wisely and with better food at Texas Roadhouse.

They have call ahead seating.  This place gets a lot of people going through there, so you'd think the food would be awesome, but it's far from it.  I had such high hopes."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last Friday night. For being a steak house I would have figured it to be above average, but the steak and enchiladas that I ordered had no flavor as if they didn't take the time to put any seasoning on it. The enchiladas that came with it were so hard that I had to use a steak knife to cut into it and even that took some strength to do. Being from Colorado and just visiting Phoenix I don't know if this is the way they serve their steaks, but here we take pride in our steaks and I wished that I experienced the same."}
{"text":"So.....I've eaten here 4xs over the past 2 years.

They kind of have the balance between kitschy and authentic just right.

 The food is ok too. You can mess up ribs....they don't. 
You can mess up fried chicken...they don't (actually really good).  
How the salmon is good is beyond me.....but it's not bad. 
You can over eat....you will. 
I defy you to leave a piece of fry bread in your basket...you won't.

The place is PACKED. It's loud. There will be random groups of people line dancing. Your drink will come in a mason jar. You WILL wait for a table unless you call ahead. 
You WILL also order the rattlesnake and the cactus fries. You will balk at the price but you won't really care. You won't understand why you like them both.

You'll probably come back when you're in the area and want to get your snake on."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the neatest restaurants in the valley that doesn't get enough pub. Yeeeehaw!!

Located on the top of a little hill in the middle of the Point, you get a great view of the valley. This is a Western style eatery, with a real bull sitting outside pretty much every night. Gives it the \"authentic\" smell i guess. When you enter, you can decide to choose the \"fun\" entrance, which is sliding down this slide instead of walking down the stairs! haha...I loved that, definitely makes you feel like a little kid again.

There's a nice live band playing on most of the nights, so pretty lively place. When you get to your seat, it's in these traditional wood benches. Along the floor, you have the typical western style hay thrown about. Nice touch to it.

Their menu selection is the classic Western food. If you are adventurous, I recommend trying the Deef Fried Rattlesnake as a starter. They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake, which is also deep fried. Meat is nothing too unique, just a tad bit chewy, however very neat presentation.

The rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food: steak, beans, etc.
After a hearty meal, I recommend standing outside the patio (when the weather is cooler) and enjoy the view of the valley. 

 If you are looking for really high quality food, you probably won't come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food. However, this place gets excellent ratings for the atmosphere. Perfect place to take any guests that visits the Valley for the first time."}
{"text":"One word: AWESOME!

We had a great waiter named Kevin, who was helpful with the menu, funny, and made sure we were always happy and having a good time.

The bread is phenomenal, the family style salad is huge and unlimited. I got the all you can eat beef ribs and they were great. Had a couple that weren't very meaty, but that's okay because I ordered more. My next plate was out about 2 minutes after ordering them, which out waiter was constantly asking.

Went on a Friday night, and the place was packed. Live music. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars because the idea and ambiance is really good. My date and I had Long Island ice teas which were really watered down and it wasn't a great start. Tried the onion rings and they came out burnt. 

On the meal she got the filet and I got the rib eye. Her steak was good and cooked well while mine was dry and over cooked. The cowboy beans were dreadfully awful compared to steakhouse or western standards. The salad was watery from too much ranch. The corn on cob was very nicely done though. 

Service was slow but adequate. Adrian just seemed overwhelmed by the busy atmosphere. He was really nice though and did what he could to make the experience better. 

I would say that you can come here for the ambiance and great views from the patio but if you are expecting above quality service and good you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm originally from Montana - and sometimes the cowboy theme just calls my name.  I've been to the Saddle Ranch many times in L.A. on Sunset Blvd.  This place reminds me of the Saddle Ranch, but less pretentious and less party-party.  

Good food...good times...good view.  4 stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"Really awful food. I mean the service was decent and the band was fun, but seriously food was absolutely terrible. Everything I ate was not good."}
{"text":"Great Views of the city!
The food is Okay but overpriced for the quality.
Do not go here for a romantic date it is loud and there are TV's everywhere to distract you.
neat experience just not for an anniversary!
Do not wear a tie! you were warned!"}
{"text":"Bar selections,  slim pickings for craft beer. We waited over 30 minutes for a table.  Waited over one hour for one hamburger. Fries were dry and the onion rings over cooked.  Doubt we will return. Unable to look at view."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I wish there was an option for  a 1/4 star rating.
Went here with another family during our \"stay-cation\" at a nearby resort. It was HORRIBLE! First, you can't miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn't very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said \"it happens\". SPEECHLESS! At least he was consistent with the rest of the night.

We had better service, treatment, and food from McDonald's the next day."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with our dinner at Rustlers Rooste. Got a T Bone for the first time in a long time. Very good !  The sides were small portions for our group size. Average at best. Loved the cotton candy at the end. Really enjoyed the country western band. Will surely go back."}
{"text":"Looks like it has potential. Came twice.  Rustic theme would be ok, if I thought it was clean.  The longhorn steer trapped in the 12x12 pen is sad.   They should find a new home for it.  Waitresses are nice, but don't pay much attention. The tables were dirty each time.  First time got a burger.  It was big but not flavorful.  Next time ordered wings and potato skins.  A runner dropped off fried mushrooms and we let the waitress know it was not ours.  He then dropped off wings to some kids that sat at our table when we got up to play shuffle board.  Kids ate  2 of the wings and left.  The waitress got us a new order and they were good, but no way close to 5 alarm.  The skins never showed up, but at least they were not on our check."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:00 pm for our reservation and were seated immediately The kids immediately donned the longhorn hats. Mr. Bobby was our server and he was great!  He spoiled our birthday group and played along with all the jokes.  Great-grandma was ready to take him home with us!

The restaurant is definitely great for families!  With the live Longhorn, waterfall, wooden bridges and of course the SLIDE! We had a blast as well as a great meal. 

We started with the rattlesnake appetizer, drinks and fry bread. Our table enjoyed the biggest cut of prime rib, hot wings, fillet, pasta, chicken fingers and ribs. Talk about stuffed!

We celebrated two birthdays with the giant eclair!  They clanged the dinner bell and announced to everyone as well invited them to sing along!

If you have kids and live in Phoenix, this is a must!  Traveling to Phoenix for vacation, make it a point to enjoy the Rooste's Hospitality!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I were looking for a decent steak or slab of prime rib last Friday night. To ensure a table, I called Thursday and made a reservation with a resounding \"Sure thing!\" from the girl on the other end. After arriving and giving them my name, however, they said it would be about 45 minutes until we'd be seated, and that they \"don't do reservations.\" Apparently, it's more of a waiting list, so whoever took my \"reservation\" probably should've said something.

A bit miffed, we sat in the bar area being bombarded with a deafening roar of country music. I had to yell to the server that I wanted a Blue Moon, and she said they don't serve it. (Really? It's a full bar; at least get bottles.) About 7 minutes after getting my sad replacement, our buzzer luckily jumped to life and we were off. Evidently, my unintentionally blurted-out comment of \"WITH a reservation?\" to the hostess after she told me the 45-minute wait-time suddenly made the line much shorter.

On our way down to the table, we kept bumping into kids who were literally running up and down the staircases and crashing into the hostess leading us. (The look on her face was priceless!) Apparently, people just let their kids run rampant through the restaurant and nobody tells them not to, and that's just normal -- you've been warned.

We were relieved to find that our table was along the edge of the restaurant, right next to the windows overlooking the valley. It was a bit quieter over here and the view was great, but then we realized our server hadn't seen us and it had already been 8 minutes or so. Isn't the target goal to make contact within 2 minutes or less as wait-staff?

She seemed overworked and was taking quite awhile to come back and take our order/check on us throughout the night. She was still polite, though.

We had a coupon from their email club for a free-ish appetizer, so we chose hot wings. Some random dude brought them out to us and couldn't tell us which were hot and which were mild. As it turned out, 10 of them were hot and 2 were mild; go figure. They were okay; nothing to die for and I definitely wouldn't pay $10 for them.

The salad was dismal. It was pre-bagged iceberg mix with some sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh-from-the-box croutons. I tasted zero dressing whatsoever and wound up using the leftover ranch from the wings. The biscuits were a bit dry and needed butter desperately. The frybread was actually tasty, but the cinnamon-butter it came with was really unexpected, and the flavor combination with my meal once it came was awful.

My fiancée and I both ordered the prime rib. The prime rib itself was decent (again, like the wings) but I've had much better for less money. It was tender but definitely past medium, which I ordered. It was pretty dry, too. There was no juice even puddled under the cut. Any true fan of prime rib sees this as a warning flag. Sides of seasonal veggies were blah; overcooked and needed salt and pepper. Their tacky, little pot of ranch beans just tasted like hot ketchup and brown sugar. We barely even touched them. Corn on the cob was waaayyy over-boiled. Pro-tip: Fresh corn on the cob only needs to be boiled about 3 minutes. Any more and you're killing it.

Portion sizes were huge, but I would've much rather had less food and actually enjoyed it thoroughly. Large portions at average quality make me kinda feel like I'm being bought off as a customer. The worst part about that is they're still charging you a lot of money for the average quality you get.

With children running by us every 2 minutes and jumping all around the booths without anyone telling them not to, we got fed up by the end of our meal and had enough. Check took awhile to get to us, but again, our server was polite and apologized. I get the feeling either their management needs to be more proactive or someone didn't show up for work that night.

PROS:
- awesome, valley-wide views
- live country music with dance floor
- seems like a great happy hour place
- polite server

CONS:
- no reservations and is absolutely PACKED on weekends; be warned
- average food at steakhouse prices
- big portions of food you won't fully enjoy
- kids (like, not one family's, but a ton) running around everywhere like they own the place

BOTTOM LINE:

Feels really touristy and tacky and forced. Another restaurant pretending to be a casual steakhouse but sacrificing quality food for a family-restaurant atmosphere. Might try it again on a weeknight, but I'm not exactly dying to go back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing view, cool atmosphere, and live music this it it! On our first visit two years ago we loved it. Second visit I took my parents when they were visiting, with my two kids. We got there twenty minutes before dinner was served and the staff was rude about not being able to sit until the dining area officially opened and made it known we were less than welcome in the bar area. We went back again last night just my husband and I. Terrible service again. Waited eight minutes for a greeting at our table, then saw our waitress once to order, when food was delivered, and then for our check. The steaks looked great, nice quality, but zero flavor. I was embarrassed to ask for steak sauce because in my opinion a good steak shouldn't need it. Bottom line is I would maybe go again in another year or so but just for a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Burger and was sorely disappointed. The burger patty was over cooked, soaked in grease, and tasteless. The fries were nothing special nor were the onion rings. The atmosphere was loud as to be expected, the waitstaff was pleasent enough; however, most barley spoke english. At least the free cotton candy was good....that's about it. Super disappointed and I will not be returning anytime soon. This place needs to focus less on the decor and atmosphere and more on the food."}
{"text":"Great place for all ages! music and decor was wonderful. Food was a little late getting to us, but we had fun waiting."}
{"text":"Six of us dined for dinner after a recent Angels exhibition game.  The restaurant is on a hill with a beautiful view. We were greeted cordially and seated.  Our server was the best art of our experience. He was efficient with a good sense of humor. As first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions. Bread and butter arrived quickly. Ou orders were promptly taken. So- so iceberg lettuce salad appeared shortly there after. 

There was one order for Prime Rib medium rare and five orders for various steaks. The meal came with green beans and corn on the cob. There were two orders for baked potatoes.  

The food came in a timely manner. The Primr Rib came medium well, was dry with little or no flavor. All of the steaks were over cooked. All of the food was Luke warm at best. We came to the conclusion that ths is a VERY LARGE restaurant; and it is difficult to individualize orders. We are not likely to return to this restaurant. The view, the magician and server were the best parts of our dinner and not the food."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Animal cruelty is the first thing you witness when walking in the door. A beautiful Texas Longhorn bull shoved into a tiny cage in the baking heat is bad enough, but the bull is obviously being neglected, extremely. He has open wounds that flies are festering, overgrown nails that he can barely walk, dirty green water, etc etc etc. I was so disgusted with this abuse I didn't want to enter. I did only because it was a friend's bday - and the food and service were awful to top it off. Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff made the dinner.  Obviously not gourmet but traveling with three kids under ten makes for an adventurous outing no matter the place. Melissa made the vacation dinner stress free and fun.  Cheers to her and the view."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this place. The staff is on point, the view is amazing and the cooking is great! I had a party of 450 people that was executed very smoothly. They go above and beyond to make your experience a fun one. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but had some friends visiting from out of town and we thought it would be fun to take them here.  First I called in the morning to see if they took reservations.  They said no, but I could do call ahead seating.  I said I'd call back after I confirmed a time with my friends.  We figured out a time and I called back only to be told they were not doing call ahead seating tonight. Ok, so we go anyway because you'd have a wait most anywhere.  We get there and the hostess asks if I did call ahead seating.  I tell her I tried but was told they weren't doing it tonight, so we get on a 40 minute wait.  60 minutes later they finally seat us.  We got menus and water right away.  30 minutes later they still haven't taken our order!  We flag someone down and get told they seated us in a closed section.... We order, get out food, which was so,so.  One order under cooked, carrots and corn over cooked.  No discount offered for the hassle.  I'll skip the tourist trap and take friends to a better place next time."}
{"text":"Very large parking lot, I was wondering where they were going to seat all those people but the seating is on two levels with an outdoor patio, seemed to be plenty of room.
We were seated fairly quickly for a Saturday evening. My only complaint about the seating is the restaurant is so dimly lit with low power bulbs that we all had our phones out with the flashlight feature on to read the menu. The live band that was playing was good, they played many cover songs of older country music.... the kind I think of as country, without the new age hip hop mixed into the song.
We all tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus appetizer and although the cactus had a nice tang to it, what they say is true, rattlesnake tastes just like chicken. 
The salad came out and it was just ok, not as crispy as I would have liked. The rolls and biscuits are good and the cinnamon butter is very good on them.
I had the small filet and the texture and tenderness was great, very easy to cut and chew. It was cooked just right but definitely needed some salt to help bring out some flavor. The carrots were ok but the beans, I really liked the flavor of the beans that went along with dinner.
We didn't have dessert but the kids got the cotton candy and shared some of that.
All in all, not the best steak meal I've had but certainly not the worst. Next time I'm in the Phoenix area I would be willing to try this place again."}
{"text":"The two story slide is fun for the kids. The cotton candy dessert is a nice touch. The food is not bad, but not great. It's a little pricey for the quality. However, the view of downtown Phoenix is nice."}
{"text":"When we arrived the place was packed and it seemed like it was going to be loads of fun.  However, they brought me the wrong meal and I had to wait 30 minutes for them to bring the steak that I actually ordered.  By this time my husband was done with his meal.  So I sat and ending up eating after he was done.  While the waitress appollogized - it didn't seem to be that big of a deal to her.  In the end - they are too busy to have good service.  I definitely would not return - you can get better food and better service loads of other place near-by."}
{"text":"Prime rib Taste great Pepsi that good and very cool for little baby's - adults you get a great view of Phoenix !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Steaks were really good, theres so much stuff too look at, and the views at night are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Took a cab from downtown Phoenix for about $30 each way. Hardly worth the drive. Nice western decor, good live music...don't go for the food."}
{"text":"I am a meat eater and I love anything juicy and fulfilling!!!!  I decided to wonder in, after a day basquing in the sun all day at the resorts waterpark.  the View is amazing, the smell of the damn cattle in front of the door, unpleasent.  But once you pass that, walk in thru a mine like entrance , almost upwards a tight shaft, then you are greeted my sweet gals that offer you to either walk down the stairs to your table, or slide down the slide.  I chose to slide down the slide, in short shorts..oooopssssies camel toe.  ;)  Old wood floors covered in sawdust and men in cowboy hats.  There is a live band playing while kids are dancing around having a blast.   The theme is working....  We have a great seat over looking central phoenix.  AMAZING!!!!! 

Geoff and I decided to order the HUGE SAMPLER which almost bascially has everything on the menu.  21.00 a person.  Great choice and damn I was full!!!!!!  I would actually love to take someone on a date here.....great atmosphere and positive energy!!!  Btw you have to try the snake!!! to die for!"}
{"text":"For first time in Az,place was an adventure from the parking down the hill (they have shuttles to the restraunt) to the entrace!!! horny! Lol we got there a lil after 5 and it was packed! Great food and service! We ordered all you can eat beef ribs $16.99 didn't even finish the last 1 lots of meat! They start you off w/biscuits yummy-cinnamon butter than salad also yummy. Huge Restraunt! Awesome view!"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I have been in Arizona a little over a year and I've heard such great reviews for this place. So, for my husbands birthday I thought lets give it a shot. Well, the atmosphere was good,but that's it. The rolls and fry bread hard, the salad socked with dressing and not crisp and the chicken blah and lastly the steak would be better if I cooked it at home!! Nice view and atmosphere wish the food tasted better."}
{"text":"1- Loud, had to be the loudest restaurant I have ever been to.
2- Food, on par with Chili's or Applebee's, nothing special.
3- Service, waiter was nice but very rushed and stressed.
4- View, the view is excellent if you can get it.
Personally I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Waited an hour for a table, then waited 20 minutes before a waiter came to our table. The hot rolls he brought were hard as rocks. We ordered a steak which was tough and cried chicken that was dry.  Very disappointing for the price and wait. Never again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out of town guests to. It's your classic Arizona cowboy kinda place. The food is good but a little pricey. I have been here 3 times and always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner DISAPPOINTMENT! WORST SERVICE!  Every year my family cooks but this year we decided to eat out and try out this restaurant. The thanksgiving dinner special  is $139 feast for 6 to 8 people, a little pricey but we thought hey it must good portions.  We were only 6 adults and a kid. Before getting into details of the experience.  I would like to say I have been in hospitality and have been in restaurant business for 10+ years for major hotels.
So our experience begins with a  \"reservation\" for 7 people at 4 pm. We get there and there is a line out the door. No separate lines for  reservations and for walk ins. They said sorry its not a reservation but priority seating only. We will have to wait for 30 min +. It ended up being an hour!  No really apologies and the hostess were completely disorganized and lacked good service.  There was actually one hostess that was amazing and kept her composer.  I apologize for not getting her name but she had straight hair and I believe she is African American. She deserves to be hired at a fine dinning restaurant.  If she reads this post I hope she applies to a fine dinning place. We get seated and our Server Dale is beat already.  But he was nice and we tried to be positive. He brought us the first course with no utensils.  He apologized and we understood they were busy and I bet the dishwasher was running behind. We order our drinks and a few were alcohol beverages.  He never asked if we wanted more drinks or check on us that frequently.  Again I am a part time server so I kept positive.  The food i do have to say was delicious but the portions were really small. Not sure really worth the price. When my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser. He didn't say excuse me. So rude. When my family and I wanted to split the check a certain way he rolled his eyes! We were going to give 20% or even a little more but soon dropped it. Then we asked for foil to cover our leftover pie he just threw it on the table and walked away without asking how was our dinning experience.  We informed the manager/owner Karen I believe and she seemed genuine but only said sorry and next time just ask for her and she would make sure we would have a different experience.  I live in California. I highly doubt I will ever come and if I have friends who visit Phoenix area I would never suggest this place.  I would probably warn them. I honestly think they need to hire a new restaurant manager and reevaluate their staff."}
{"text":"SO FUN! The food wasn't special, save the steaks, but the atmosphere was amazing! Music, dancing, hay, cotton candy, fun! Would love to come back! Great service too"}
{"text":"It is highly recommended by my colleague down here.  The atmosphere is great, cowboy themed restaurant and this is a great band playing.  We are seating by the windows and you can see a great view of Phoenix.  I ordered a T-bone steak but I have to say the the steak is good except it is not hot enough.  It will be much better if they can heat up the plate a little bit before they served the steak."}
{"text":"Great view and great food all ten times I've been but the service unfortunately really lacks even on a slow weekday night. I know there are always unforseen obstacles a dinner crew faces at a restaurant but in Rustler's Rooste case things will happen such as a server dropping the food on a tray stand in front of the table without any word of what to do when it is clearly your food and then walking away. Almost every time I've been they forget someone's entree or side and the last time they outright forgot my entire table's salad. Basically you'll see your server about ten minutes and then be stuck to fend for yourself."}
{"text":"We were directed this way from the concierge at our timeshare. We are happy that we took her suggestion! This is a  definite must-see  if you're in the Phoenix area. We enjoyed live music as we had cocktails and appetizers. The service was slow, but that's okay because we were on vacation. Besides, the overall experience outweighed the slow service and mediocre food. The fry bread was awesome though!!! A definite repeat if we're back in town."}
{"text":"Great experience, good food, good service, fabulous atmosphere and gorgeous view from the patio.
I would suggest this restaurant to all food lovers. The rattlesnake was tasty (first timer :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun place to go, this is it.  Absolutely beautiful view of the city. Get there early if you want a table by the window because this place is huge and it fills up.  You don't get dressed up to come (unless cowboy boots and jeans is dressed up) and you have a good time.  Entertainment starting early in the evening.  If you want a really good steak, go to a really good steak house.  Food is OK but you come here for the fun.  Priced right and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I went to rustlers with my entire family last night for my grandparents 50th anniversary!! I am an arizona native and personally have never seen the place I call home look so pretty and almost big! I personally enjoyed the food we had a set menu and the food just kept coming out everything from their biscuts to the cotton candy was excellent. I thought it was never gonna end, everything was served family style but out of the 27 of us there not one of us had a single complaint, all of our main courses came out at the exact same time no complaints, we got the kids meals first which I found nice since kids can get restless in a place were your trying to actually dine! The casual attire is nice, kids love the slide, my daughter loved looking at the city lights also, workers are very hospitable all in all one of the nicest places I've been to and I would love to go again whether its for another family outing or just my husband and i. The only thing I would have a complaint about is the steep walking if you don't do valet and its defanitly not easy if you have to carry a seven month baby up hill so I recomend getting a babysitter for the tiny ones but two and older I would say your good to go!"}
{"text":"There was an hour wait to be seated. Which I can deal with if the rest of the experience would have been better. So we went downstairs to thebar to get a drink while we waited. The bartender was super swamped, I felt bad for the guy. He was trying his hardest to keep up. They finally got him some help but it took 25 minutes to get our drinks. After that we went upstairs to the other bar and were completely ignored by the bartender and he definitely saw us.( the drinks were way over priced anyways! ) We finally got to our table. The waiter was nice and very attentive. The food was absolutely terrible. Ordered the all-you-can-eat beef back ribs but when they came out they were all fat and charcoal black. We were there a total of 3 hours almost 
 
NOT worth the wait 
NOT worth the price
And definitely NOT worth the food.!!!
Cool atmosphere but
Won't go back"}
{"text":"Mr memory of this restaurant was much better than reality. The atmosphere is rustic with a good view, but the food was poor. The BBQ ribs were very dry, the corn tasted old   The cotton candy for the kids not only was a surprise but maybe the best thing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here as often as I can with friends and family!! I love starting off with their freshly made biscuits and fry bread and applying the most amazing cinnamon butter on them!! Their house salad is by far my favorite house salad since their home made ranch is delicious, which typically I do not enjoy ranch but here I could drink it! I also recommend their onion rings that are amazing, yet another item I don't typically enjoy at most places!! Their steaks are amazing! My favorite is their tenderfoot filet! For dessert I would recommend their Cowper which is my favorite or their chocolate cake! The view here is incredible! Especially for the sunset! They have a live band which sounds amazing! They have stairs but I recommend taking the slide ;). When you first walk up to the restaurant you are greeted by a real life steer!! The atmosphere is very lively and family friendly! Hey also have a magician and balloon maker that will come around the tables! Overall I highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"They don't make you feel welcome, and it's always crowded. The servers act like you're bothering them most of the time. The food is ok, but not great. It's a very touristy place, but I also can't recommend it because the nearby resort recently removed all of the Pokémon Go stops in the area. This leaves kids with nothing to do, and shows a complete lack of respect to Go players. They don't want you there, so don't bother."}
{"text":"Old AZ brought to life in a barn. Great food, live band and a metal slide to entertain the kids! Fun relaxed pace, felt like we were in Texas."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  The multilevel parking lots were full, so I knew the place was popular, but I began to have second thoughts upon walking up to the sight (and smell) of an actual longhorn.  Great views, though, and really good food, including a pleasantly surprising veggie burger.  Lots of kids, so it's loud, hence the four stars.  If you have kids, it's probably five stars for you."}
{"text":"I had been there before years back. Great location , live country music something different , but the food was too bad to give it more than 2 stars. Service was quick and friendly but what they served was awful . Seemed like everything was old and flavorless. Like it was sitting around for hours before serving  even the baked beans made canned super market beans seem gourmet . Dried out ribs, something that was supposed to be steak and seafood that was a war crime . Pass on this place and enjoy many of the other fine places in town. They clearly don't care"}
{"text":"I normally don't write bad reviews but I took my girlfriend here. We sat with a dirty table the whole time the waitress never check up on us just dropped the tray of food by our table and left the food isn't as good for what I was paying for it i don't think I will ever be back. I originally came in for the Mountain view but I couldn't even enjoy it I was to busy trying to get someone's attention. I feel like I was robbed the best part of the night was their shuttle driver"}
{"text":"Last night my party of 6 arrived at 5:30 and was told there would be a 70 minute waitwhich we decided was acceptable because i had visitors from out of state that were anticipating this wonderful experience that Rustlers Rooste had been hyped up to be. After waiting 70 minutes I checked with the hostess and was informed the wait would be seated shortly. After another 30 minutes I checked in  to no avail. My party had become restless and Hungry. We did contact a manager who said he would get us a table next, but after 2 hrs waiting without being informed of  any extensions in wait time or reasons given, we left and will not be returning. I am soo disappointed that what was supposed to be a fun excursion with family and friends went so badly and ended up going home without dinner. Driving in from the West valley and friends from Mesa  left empty bellied and disheartned. Please review your protocol for seat times so others are not given a false hope"}
{"text":"This is one of the strangest places I have ever been.

This restaurant has a cow that lives at the front of the restaurant. He looks concerned.

The space is split into two, but I'm not sure how. I know this because when we asked for a table, the lady said that we could sit in some seats now, but other seats weren't available until later. I wasn't clear on which seats were available and which weren't, which concerned me greatly because then she said I could have a seat, and later I could have a different seat, which meant I had to figure out which seats were ok so we just sat near some other people. Eventually we switched to other seats, at which point, luckily, someone showed us where to sit.

The entire theme of this place is like, inside a barn or something. \"Western Cowboy\" or something like that.  Lots of wood, lots of steaks and meats, and people dressed 'country' style or something like that. People were wearing boots and I don't think it was because they were outside hanging out with the cow.

The food was pretty good. People complain about their meat not being done like they ordered it, but for the love of dog, you're sitting in a giant barn and there's a cow outside - the strangest thing going on here isn't your meat being cooked a bit off.

The service was ok - they weren't busy at the time, but when we needed a spoon to dish out the sides with, that took about 5 minutes, which isn't a long time, but it feels like a long time when you've got food sitting in front of you. I'm also not saying the waitress didn't have something better to do - she did a good job - I don't know what was going on during those 5 minutes. Might have been problems with the cow or something. Just saying - it wasn't speedy.

But hey, the place has a great view. I'd say to check it out, but it's not the kind of place I'd bring a date unless I was already drunk. More of a family place or maybe there's some whole kind of country-western thing I don't know about, so if you're into that you might like checking it out too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is bad all around.
Parking is bad, wait time is bad, service is bad, food is bad, and you pay way too much for everything bad.

I've wanted to come here, seeing it on top of the hill everytime I pass by it driving I-10 going somewhere else. And now that I've experienced it I warn you this place is bad.

The good thing I can say is that the view is good."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. .. after spending $92 for a t bone, that was grilled and sat for some time,  with old corn on the cob,  old glazed carrots. ... and a hamburger not worth the money.....the only saving grace is the view!"}
{"text":"Tonight our family of 13 dined at your restaurant to celebrate my daughters 12th and my cousins 9th birthday. We dine at Rustlers Rooste on a monthly basis; but unfortunately, today will be our last. Dan Garcia (restaurant manager) ruined our daughters birthday by yelling at her with his finger in her face to get off the slide because she was sitting on a sweatshirt while going down. After my daughter explained the her father said it was ok he then said \" does your father own this restaurant, is your father the manager, I didn't think so\". After having words with him he proceeded to be a complete ass and ruined the night for the entire group. We all got to go boxes and took our dinners to home to enjoy. 
Dan Garcia should not be in a position that he deals with the public."}
{"text":"I'm so happy my husband found this place for our family to eat. The service was good, our toddlers enjoyed the food and actually ate, and the atmosphere was very fun. I ordered the Rustler special and the steak was cooked perfect, medium rare!! This place is my new favorite restaurant. It's a taste of home."}
{"text":"Pretty annoyed at this place... Had reservations for 6:30 didnt get sat until around 8 pm . Service was fast but got undercooked steaks and sat by a open cold door ..... Hostess girls  were rude and not helpful. I definitely do not recommend this place. if you want flavorless steaks and staff that don't care about the guests , then yea ..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous city view and fun ambiance.  There's a longhorn steer outside just so you get the message and you have the option of sliding (a slide!) into the restaurant.  Loved the country & western band playing and watching people dance; also loved walking out on the patio and watching the sun set.  Now for the food and service: we had a crabby waitress but even she couldn't ruin our great ribs, tender rolls and interesting prickly pear cactus fries appetizer.  

I'd recommend this place, as long as you know what you're in for!"}
{"text":"Service was average, food average, meat was cooked to a crisp when we ordered medium. Our bread basket literally consisted of hard as rock bread. Our server wasn't seen much, drinks were empty a very long time. 

Best part of our very pricey experience was Clyde the magician. 

This used to be our go to place for out of town guests. We won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't tell you this because it just makes the place that much harder to get a reservation, but Rustlers Roost is AMAZING on the 4th of July! 
Not only can you see almost every location of fireworks from their outdoor veranda, but if you have the right seat, you can dine and watch from indoors as well! 

My fiancé and I love to swing dance and it is typical for a waiter to come by to deliver our food and we are off on the dance floor, swinging to live country music. 

I do love the free biscuits and fry bread they bring, as well as salad. And the drinks come in mason jars! 

Basically, this place is an experience-not just a restaurant. So if you want a great time, have loud kids, love to dance, eat, talk- go to RR! 

And get your free cotton candy before you go!"}
{"text":"The view is awesome. Great service! The food is really good.  The kids love the slide. Great time!"}
{"text":"Well they told us a 45 min wait and that turned into an hour and a half. If you ask them how much longer they will tell you your next... Again and again. They sat our party of 7 in a booth for six and told us we would have to wait longer for a bigger table. Oh, wait... What about all the other 8 person open tables. Well those sections are closed. We have been sitting at our table for 20 min. now with little sight of our server.... Keep you posted. It has been 30 min now and 9:05pm the kids are pretty hungry. Wait there goes our server again... Well maybe next time. Dinner ordered its 9:15, let's see how long it takes. So the dinner came pretty quick 9:35. 3 in our party ordered chicken fingers and onion rings. The server failed to tell us the onion rings only come as an appetizer, so we have 3 full baskets or rings and plates of fries and chicken fingers. We also got a garden burger, steak, and 2 kids chicken fingers and fries. The steak was pretty good and my wife said the garden burger was good. It is now 10:00 pm. We are waiting on the bill now... 10:05, we are walking out. Very bad experience! Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Great steak! I highly recommend the huckleberry Margarita. The carrots that came with the meal were meh...guest staff was awesome...I will visit next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Five stars for the atmosphere and views.   Three stars for the food.   Cool place to visit if you are looking to step back into the Old West.   They had old country band playing some tunes and Shiner Bock on tap for Happy Hour.   We had an amazing view of Phoenix/Tempe area out the window.   Before dinner, they bring bread/biscuits and a big salad.   The salad was very ordinary at best but the bread was pretty good.   I ordered the Prime Top Sirloin for my main course.   It was cooked perfectly and was tasty for a lean cut of meat.    It came w/ cooked carrots and a small piece of corn on the cob.   While the food was not bad, it did not taste any better than what I could make at home on my own..."}
{"text":"I have taken some REALLY FABULOUS pictures from Rustler's Roost of Four Peaks on those rare occasions when the snow in the high country has left a significant dusting on the Peaks. Truly a fabulous experience to see and to capture with a telephoto lens - a photographic moment for my memory and on film and digitally !!! A MUST see and do!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night, 2/8/13.  Food was AWFUL!  My husband had a \"medium well\" steak that was tasteless and OVERcooked (like rubber).  He couldn't eat it.  I tried it and couldn't chew it. 

I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and it was TERRIBLE.  DRY!!!  Ate three bites.

My daughter ordered a cheeseburger which was okay.  Fries were cold.

We all had the salad which wasn't anything special.  Head lettuce with their \"own\" ranch dressing.  The biscuits were dry and cold.  The green beans were cold and mushy.  The corn was cold.  The baked beans were gross.  The fry bread was good.

After waiting an hour for a table, I'm convinced that our food was sitting under warmers, hence the results.  If we'd been wasted, as many patrons were, we might of thought the food was acceptable, but we weren't.

Also, the bull in the front of the restaurant didn't exactly help my appetite. The smell was unbearable, even inside.

We will NEVER go here again.  The restaurant was cool and the band made the atmosphere but the food was simply BAD!  The view was really pretty.

*We didn't complain to the waiter simply because we didn't want to try ANYTHING else.  Figured we'd pay and NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such bad reviews. We are staying at the Arizona Grand Resort and came here twice in 4 days. We were pleasantly surprised by everything about this place. The bull in front was fun for the kiddos. The slide was a hit! Kids eat free all summer long!! They bring you free salad and rolls AND free cotton candy at the end of your meal. Not to mention everyone who works there is SUPER nice and friendly!! This will definitely be one place we will miss when we go home! Thanks for making this a place that my kids will NEVER forget!!!"}
{"text":"This rating should be 0 out of 5. 
They ruined our close friend's surprise birthday party with their 'call ahead, and when you get here you'll only wait 25 - 30 minutes for a table, rather than an hour like the folks who have walked in' policy. The worst part of this experience, is that we called ahead to verify we would be seated by 7PM so we could surprise our good friend on his birthday. No one stated that there would be a wait to get seated, being fully aware of the situation, and that this is a surprise birthday dinner. They dropped the ball with communicating this. We spoke to the manager, who provided useless solutions like \"we'll get you a table as soon as possible... yeah... sorry. Terrible service. Please don't bother with eating here. It's way over priced, the management is terrible, and not worth the crappy atmosphere, and experience.
You've been warned."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is tourist-ie and yes, you do smell the longhorn on the way into the restaurant, but, as a tourist in Phoenix, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience (and food).  I went there with my wife, in-laws and three 11 year olds.  The kids actually donned their menu (which converts into a longhorn crown-like hat) on their own and went down the slide several times.  All of it (including the fried rattlesnake) is a bit gimmicky, but the gimmicks worked on us.

Their BBQ sauce was very smoky and savory.  I actually would have bought a bottle but forgot to do so before I left.  The rattlesnake tasted like chicken only tougher.  The steaks were cooked as-ordered (i.e., a medium rare = medium rare).  The service was good, and the kids loved having the balloon artist (he made a fire-breathing dragon, an armadillo and a sea turtle).  He was very personable and even provided a one-night warranty on blow-outs!  Of course, we had a nice view of the city, including a lightning storm. Was the food the best I've ever had, probably not, but the overall experience is definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews before eating at the Rooste.  I was worried, to say the least.  The reviews I saw were terrible.  My parents, my son and I went together at about 5:30 pm on a Monday night.  Here are the points:
1. Our waitress was attentive and very adorable.
2. We enjoyed seeing the longhorn at the front door.  He was lying down, so his odor was at a minimum.
3. The \"mine\" entrance was fun, and my 14 yo had just toured a mine the day before, so that made it more interesting to us.
4. My son wouldn't go down the slide, but my dad and I both slid into the restaurant.  The little kids sliding there were adorable.
5. The upstairs bar area looked nice, and had a better view, so next time I might opt to stay upstairs and just go for the appetizer menu if that's what they serve there.
6. We were seated quickly at a window seat down stairs by the patio.  The view is good.  We could see Camelback Mountain.  The view upstairs would be a lot better, in my opinion.
7. There were a lot of small children.  A lot.  But they were well behaved and it didn't get too noisy.  Some have complained about the noise, but being early on Monday, the place wasn't full
8. The live band was good and where we were seated it wasn't too loud for talking to each other.
Overall, we enjoyed the Wild West theme.  It isn't too overwhelming if you are ready for it.  The view and the theme are the reasons to go to this place.

Now for the food.  Remember that this place is more about atmosphere, and less about the food.  And the food is meant to be simple cowboy food, not gourmet.  It was good for me to start with very low expectations.
1. We were served a bowl of bread.  The Indian Fry Bread was really pleasant.  I would like to learn to make those little breads.  The biscuit was not good.  It was dry and hard.  I ate mine.  It was a waste of space in my stomach.  I recommend skipping the biscuit.
2. A family bowl of salad came next.  It is pre-tossed with ranch dressing.  The salad was fine.  It is like a standard iceberg/red cabbage mix.  We thought it had just the right amount of dressing tossed on.  It was not drenched in dressing.  Thank goodness.  After all the terrible reviews I had meant to ask for the dressing on the side, but forgot.
2. I ordered the Big Burger  It was definitely good.  I ordered medium-rare and it as perfectly cooked, and was large and juicy.  It came with fries and onion rings.  I love onion rings, and I felt the onion rings at the Rooste were very good.  The french fries on the other hand, were just OK.  I didn't finish them because they were not really crispy.   
3. My Dad ordered the veggie burger.  It was just OK.  Unless you are a vegetarian, don't get this.  It was more expensive than our delicious real beef burger.  He said the vegetarian chili was good.
4. My Mom ordered a steak and vegetables.  Her steak was medium-rare just as she ordered.  It was big and juicy.  She loved it.   Very good.  Her vegetables were steamed, not seasoned, but she said they were good.  The corn on the cob was good.  Not over-cooked.
I wanted to order dessert, but was too full.

I doesn't get a four or five star because the food is western, which to me is rather plain.  There was nothing outstanding or exotic about the food.  Plus it was a little expensive.  $14.95 seems like a lot to pay for a burger.  Although, it was huge and came with a lot of bread and salad...

Overall we had a great experience.  When we left there was a cowboy roping metal calves on the patio, and the band was singing pleasant country music.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate a family member birthday.  We sat at the windows and had a wonderful view. The slide and bull on entry were a hit with the family. I had steak and it was good, but typical fare for a mid-level steakhouse. It came with carrots, corn, salad. The table received a basket of biscuits and fry bread which went over well. Service was quick and our server was nice and informative. When the check arrived it came with cotton candy. I thought my youngest was going to hit the floor, as he loves cotton candy.  Overall, the evening sights of the city, western decor, decent food, and kid friendly atmosphere made it a keeper for this family. We will be back again."}
{"text":"It was a really cool and the views so nice! I have been their twice, so I'll tell both of my stories:

The first time i went was after a friend told us about it and said that is was great so we went with just our family as a fun family outing. We enjoyed the bull and the walk inside and the slide to get downstairs. We had a booth seat for the four of us right next to a window to see the whole Valley! We ordered our food and since it was a Saturday night and it's usually busy so it took a while, but they filled in with different types of bread and butters! After about a twenty five minute wait, they brought out our food and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfect and the fries were so crunchy and yummy. After they entertain you with cotton candy for desert! The cotton candy was a surprising grape flavored which was amazing since I'm not a big grape flavored candy fan. There was a live band and we danced and had fun time at the photo booth and since it was near Christmas was able to take a picture with Santa! Our family outing was awesome and we had a great time!

The second time wasn't as great as the first time though. So here's the story: our friend was in town from Virginia so we decided to show her a recommended restaurant popular in the valley. When we told her about the amazing view, the slide, the bull and the comfortable booths. Well... We had the opposite experience. When we tried to go see the bull, he wasn't there because of SICK. So we decided to ignore that and go in and and eat. It took a long time for the waiter to come and finally got here. We got a table on the top floor so we couldn't go on the slide and had to go on it after we ate. We had a table with chair and the chair were to close for comfort to the person behind us. We were also next to the arcade were a bunch of crazy, drunk people were screaming and having a \"blast\". It was pretty annoying. Well after that tragic welcoming, the food was fast on a Thursday night but the portions were small. We finished eating and enjoyed the usual grape flavored cotton candy and then left. We decided not to complain about the little flaws and enjoyed the rest of our night. 

Anyway every restaurant has flaws and we always don't have perfect experiences! I love the food and the great costumer service and definitely will eat here again!"}

Go for happy hr - reg. food prices not worth the value (or lack of it)"}
{"text":"We had a rocky start, but the manager, Tom, heard our concerns and turned the night around. Thank you Tom!"}
{"text":"Wife took back steak twice due to no flavoring. Was told by manager the steaks are salt and peppered...
Recommend Texas Road House. Cheaper and they season their meat. Wife not compensated for anything, left hungry..."}
{"text":"Great cowboy ambiance and night time views.
Horrendous food. 
Not sure that I can recall a worse NY Strip steak."}
{"text":"Screw this place.  No substitutions, no flexibility, poor customer service."}
{"text":"I'm amazed this place is still open. My wife and I decided to check it out because neither of us had been there in about 15 years (since we were kids) and we were excited to go back. There's a bull out front in a small pen that looks pathetic and smells like poop. Let the poor thing live a better life somewhere else! After the 45 degree hike up to the hostess station we were greeted with silence and staring. We initiated an introduction with Hi!!! They silently asked, \"just you two?\"  Then another exploration up and down stairs and slides and weaving in and out of 43 kids to our table it was almost impossible to squeeze into the seats. And we're not big people. The menu was still all gimicky from the 80s in a newspaper style that was hard to understand. The live band was loud and terrible. We left before our server came. Horrible experience."}

{"text":"Had a great dinner for our twins 13th birthday !!!! Service was was awesome, fast & friendly. 
Food was good & worth the value."}
{"text":"View was incredible. Service was quick and nice. Fried bread was delicious.  Steaks were mediocre.  Vegetables and sides were awful."}
{"text":"Blah!  Our family came to celebrate a birthday dinner in a fun atmosphere!  Rustic is a kind word to describe the setting. The appetizers were fine, $20 to try rattlesnake and cactus that was over-breaded and then deep fried....and that was the highlight of the meal!  Then there was the dinner. There was seven of us so we ordered a variety of items off of the menu.  Steaks were chewy and lacked flavor, burgers were blah, fries were soggy, and the corn and carrots were like what I used to get in the school cafeteria!  Our biscuits were literally rock hard, the rice had an awful taste and the swordfish was dry and tasted fishy.
I suppose they have a great gimmick going and don't necessarily need to have good food to keep people coming in. Maybe I'm just too much of a city slicker to appreciate this cuisine!  
I could only imagine what sort of business they could do at a location with so much potential!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Rustler's Rooste, and I must say that it left its mark. The food took a while to come, but if you have trouble waiting, you may consider the fault in your company and converse. The drinks were fruity and refreshing, with The Clooney Margarita having a nice balance of easy to drink and bite to it.

When the food came, the portions were enormous. I had difficulty finishing a fraction of it. 
Best fish I've had, better than either coast. The steak was juicy and soft, and the beans and corn were some of the best I've ever had. 
Here's where I speak on the mashed potatoes. 

They were legendary. I've never had any their equal. Such a flavorful dish is rare. Garlic, butter, salt. All the usual suspects, but in a balance you've never quite experienced. Art. Do not pass up the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after a relative suggested it. They had been here years ago and said it was cool. They were right, its kinda cool, rustic, especially the views from up there but the food is nothing special. High priced for what you get. Lots of kiddies running around so its not a place you would want to go for a special occasion. Unless its your kids birthday party. Wont be returning. Just not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"Crazy, over-decorated, huge, kitchy, tourist-trap kind of experience. Should preface with the fact that we are vegetarian and were meeting a friend here who has wanted to check it out for a while. 

Drove up on a Saturday night at 7pm (apparently can't make reservations until after 8pm) and couldn't find any parking by the restaurant, weren't feeling in the mood for valet, so went down a decently sized hill to the extra parking lot. This resulted in us basically hiking to dinner, up a steep sidewalk with no stairs. Not sure how a family with any disabled or elderlies would handle this. Would have to pay for valet, I suppose. Walked to front door, hit with wall of \"cow smell\", and sure enough there was a HUGE longhorn just chillin out about ten feet away. Walked in, more ramps to hike up, finally made it to level ground at the front desk area. All the hostesses were basically wearing American flags for shirts and the servers were decked out in cowboy gear. We had a hard time getting the attention of the hostess taking names which was a little frustrating. We were surprised to be seated immediately having no reservation on Saturday night, but I suppose this place is SO HUGE that it isn't much of a problem for smaller parties. It took a couple minutes to get through the labyrinth and find our table, on the way passing the oh-so-popular slide that you can take from floor 2 to floor 1. 

Sat down and tried to start a conversation, and were immediately interrupted by the triangle-wielding server army that came to the table next to us to sing Happy Birthday. Lots of banging and clanging served for a poor conversation atmosphere, and this was only the first of several birthday celebrations throughout our meal! We ordered a pitcher of the Arizona margarita to split between two people, and it was pretty darn huge. However the margarita was quite disappointing - all sugar and no alcohol. We finished the whole pitcher and felt nothing except slightly ill at the sugar content.

We ordered the one veggie menu item, the veggie burger. Our friends got the prime rib. The meal started with a large basket of fry bread and biscuits with regular and cinnamon butter, pretty standard but yummy. Then the server brought a huge salad for the table to share, tossed with ranch dressing. That was a nice touch that we didn't realize was included. The meal came, and we were pretty shocked to see that it included green beans, corn on the cob, steak fries, veggie chili, AND the burger!! We couldn't finish one meal between two people, and we are good eaters. Everything was good, but nothing special. The green beans seemed fresh though the corn did not. The steak fries were yummy. The burger was good (housemade I believe) but nothing special. Our friend really liked his prime rib. It looked well-prepared and gigantic, just like everything else in the joint. The meal ended with the server bringing a tin can full of cotton candy. Man, they just don't want you to live past 40 around here!!!

For vegetarians who never go to places like this, I'd say we had close to the best experience we could have expected. It is a loud atmosphere and everything is pretty pricy - however, you are paying for a MASSIVE amount of food, so I suppose it works out. Our takeaways: Definitely split a meal, do NOT get the margaritas, and don't come here for a classy place and intimate conversation. You are coming for the experience (and the pretty spectacular view!). We won't be back, but can't say the same for our meat-eating friends!"}
{"text":"Went there for Easter Brunch - great food and fun atmosphere. Nice views for family photos."}
{"text":"Overall Rustler's Rooste is a very unique place with an authentic cowboy environment and a slide down to the main floor for all diners. The view of Phoenix and the surrounding valley is amazing. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Live country music was a bonus. Food was decent but steaks needed a little more seasoning. Would have given 5 stars but it lacked overall cleanliness."}
{"text":"This is a great place for steaks and outdoor bbq.  If you are into meat, this is a fantastic spot.  They have the smokers, outside grills and everything that has to do with meat.

Why do I emphasize this?  Because people complain (in the reviews) about the tuna and/or other unrelated food item.  I came for the meat.  Plain and simple.

Great ambiance and great music.  All the staff was kind and courteous.  It might be a little to tilted toward tourists but the night I was there there were a ton of locals.

All in all, this is a spot that looks different, smells different and it will surprise you.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Moderate food, poor service but unbeatable views and family friendly location. Go here with out of town guests but not for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"The theme of this place is amazing but unfortunately their food is not that great.. I expected something really good and it was nothing close to good. I was so disappointed to see that the cactus that was served to me was from a can and not fresh..  for about 20 dollars Smfh I hate this places \"food\" everything was bland. I expected more for my buck because it's not cheap."}
{"text":"Rustlers rooste has been one of our family stay vacation favorite restraunts.s it so close to the resort we stay at, the atmosphere at this restraunt is awesome and the people are very nice. The food is good ad well."}
{"text":"brought friends from out of town here. The food was good..The Prime rib was straight out of the Flintstones. Just huge. Kids had a good time. Not fine dining but it has a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Once is an Accident, Twice is a Coincidence, Three Times is a Pattern

This is my third time here and it was just as bad as before.  Service is not good.  We ordered a plain cheeseburger for my son.  Waitress said that it will still come with veggies because the cook staff gets it wrong and will put then on the plate.  Really?  Try to save money on veggies and they aren't smart enough to keep then off the plate?  Food is pretty awful.  I had the New York strip this round and it had zero flavor.  Good thing for horse radish.  Corn on the cobb had been in the pot since yesterday all mushy.  Did us served in hospital type trays and that is what this tasted like.

Atmosphere is fun with great views as others mentioned and I am guessing that is why this place stays opened."}
{"text":"Wow... seeing high marks for the food is insane!  Yes atmosphere is fun with live music, great views along with fun decorations but the food is horrible and customer service is only a bump past that. 
I ordered a hamburger witch had zero flavor and my wife got the trout that was terrible. They replaced with fried chicken and that also had zero flavor.   The house salad was a joke. 
It's a tourist destination and apparently that is enough for them to not worry about the things that count. Food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"*** oops, didn't see that I had previously reviewed this place, so sorry if it sounds repetitious***

Went there the other night with family visiting from out of town.  This is definitely the go to place to take visitors and has been for a long time.  Being a near native, I practically grew up here and it is still a wonderful experience.

The food is just okay in my opinion but the ambience and view more than make up for it.  

On our last visit, we started with the potato skins.  They make the best I've ever had.  Perfection.

I had the big burger and it was just that - big.  I made it through half of it before calling it quits.

Very cute that they give complimentary cotton candy at the the end of the meal and the kids loved getting balloon butterflies. 

Loved that we could go outside, relax and visit with family at the end of the night.

Our visitors always end up leaving with one of the $35 rattlesnake head keychains.  Pretty unique from where they're from."}
{"text":"Poor food baked potato not done.  Very disappointed poor quality and poor preparation on food. I complained to the waitress that the potato wasn't done and she just shrugged and walked away.  The corn was so over cooked it was hard to eat and had no flavor.  We will not go back  This was such a disappointment for a special day"}
{"text":"Go here if you're visiting Phoenix. It's a great one-time experience. The kids will like the slide, the adults will like the music and everyone will enjoy the view. The food is average for the price you'll pay. They do have rattlesnake as an appetizer and a chocolate eclair for those celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight on Christmas! Our server was great, Brennan, Brendan, Brandon? (I couldn't hear from across the table lol) but I know it's something like that. He was very attentive and everything flowed so smoothly. Our food was really great too! Loved the prime rib. 4 of us at the party ordered prime rib \"med-rare,\" and we wanted it to be cooked a little more \"done\" when it came out and he did take them back to be cooked a bit more for us without a problem. He also made sure we tried the cotton candy! Great service. There were very reasonable wait times on Christmas which was really nice too. It was super busy by the time we left. This is the spot for my family on special occasions and we love it here. Request our server!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  A total dining experience and the magic show at our table was the BEST any of us had ever seen!"}
{"text":"This place is considered a steakhouse?? More like a child care service with mediocre food. Noisy, no dress code, extremely slow service and really disappointing. Stupid kids running everywhere. Our server was a low talker, which made it hard to hear what he was explaining on the menu. Steaks were tough, shrimp was dry and a dinky bowl of beans for a table of 6. I just can't right now."}
{"text":"Yes it's touristy but I think that's the point. The view is amazing. The food is ok, nothing special. But we did enjoy trying rattlesnake for the first time. We actually liked it. That and the cactus fries. Both were not bad. The salad is basic and enjoyable. The lettuce was crisp and it wasn't over dressed. The side of beans were lacking....maybe some good salsa would have helped them. The pork ribs were the best thing we ordered. They had a good amount of meat and BBQ sauce. Personally I prefer to taste the meat a bit more then all the bbq sauce but again this is a touristy place. The carrots were completely over cooked but my daughter has braces so she liked them. The nachos were very basic, the jalapeño made it work. My group enjoyed the slide and the magician. He was very entertaining. The live music was also enjoyable. Again it's touristy and there was a bit of everything including the live bull out front named horny. Service was good. It however must have been our table location as two servers tripped at our table when bringing us our food. One ended up with the dip all down him. He never did bring us more dip, now that I think about it. The second server almost ended up with the tray on her also. When we left I notice they were cleaning up broken glass. So I'm not sure if there is just not clear walking paths or what. Portions are good sizes however it's a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Back in town and invited friends to join us. Seemed to be under staffed. Waited quite a while for a table. Quite a while for a server, to get to drinks, to order, and a very long time to get our meals. Food was generous portions, tasty. Atmosphere is so enjoyable we didn't mind at all, we were visiting and catching up and the off night for us perfectly. Not sure when we might be back in the, area but will recommend and keep on our radar"}
{"text":"This place gets two stars because of the view. 

I was visiting from out of town and was brought here by some locals. We had a reservation for 8pm.  We did not get seated till 8:35pm with no apology. When we were be walked to our table we saw lots of empty tables so not sure why we were made to wait. 

The food is quite mediocre. 
My med. rare tbone was sent back the first time as it was cooked med well. 
It was also the thinest tbone i have ever seen. 

I guess I shouldnt have expected better since it is a tourist trap but cmon, the food should at least taste good."}
{"text":"Poor service... Actually horrible service. The band was great. The atmosphere is great for out of towners but the food is subpar. I recommend checking it out if you're a tourist, just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and was about what I'd expect from a steakhouse but the view is amazing and the atmosphere was really cool."}
{"text":"The food wasn't spectacular but the atmosphere absolutely makes up for it! Our family had such a great time here."}
{"text":"Steakhouse? This term is used loosely at the Rustler's Rooste.  This is a \"cowboy\" themed restaurant with a very casual atmosphere and great views of the valley.  But surely no one comes here for the food, let alone the steaks.

I ordered the \"USDA Prime\" 10oz. sirloin and had a hard time believing it was anything better than Choice.  There was no flavor to this steak. There was plenty of food, so no one went home hungry, but this place is nothing to write home about - thus, this entry! ;)

Oh, and despite the novelty, don't bother with the rattlesnake appetizer. It has to be one of the worst things on the menu.  No, it doesn't taste like chicken.  I'd rather eat alligator any day!

Pros:
- Great views of the valley
- Attentive & courteous wait staff
- Reasonably priced with mostly ~$20 entrees

Cons:
- The food
- The noise"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a lot of fun and a great place to bring people who are visiting. We got the Cowboy Stuff and it was tasty. The salad and bread was great, the meat was all very good, the swordfish was flavorful, corn was perfect. And the cotton candy at the end was a nice cap to the end of a great meal.

I just wish they had more side options, i.e. broccoli, asparagus, etc."}
{"text":"So bummed!  We had been waiting to hit this place up- the fam was excited too!!  We called to find out if they accepted reservations this particular evening they were doing walk ins only, which was fine. But our hotel clerk said make sure we get reservations. The hostess over the phone said, \"as long as your here in the door seated by 10, you will get service.\"  WRONG!  We got there at 9, our waiter was super bugged we were even there. Offered the special- which was fish or something then he proceeded to say, \"well- it was the special, but we're all out.\"  Then brings out bread and salad with no plates, says he will be right back and doesn't come back for 7-10 minutes So we eat bread and biscuits off napkins as the kids (2 of em') were starving. Finally brings plates gets our order and about 20-25 mins later brings our food. It was pretty good, we finish and he TELLS the kids,  hey kids do you want Cotton Candy- comes back and tells the kids. Sorry!  COME ON!?!  don't tell the kids your bringing it and then tell them never mind!!!!!  They get a balloon made, which was pretty cool and the server is quick to push us out the door. We tell them we are staying at the resort so they can call us the shuttle. We wait outside for 10 mins, go in and tell the bartender that we have been waiting. He proceeds to tell my husband, \"just look for him, he's out side. I know if I call him he's just gonna tell me he's outside.\"  He wasn't. We waiting another 10 and finally made it back. Service sucked, people except the balloon maker sucked, food was pretty good. I guess my suggestion is go in the middle of the day or not at all!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Skip the rattlesnake tho. Unless you love breading dipped in ranch dressing. Cactus fries were pretty good. 
Bartenders just this side of rude. 
Gimmicky cowboy schtick they never quite pull it off tho. One time stop at this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a horrible disappointment.  In short, wish I'd never been.

We went there because some in our group liked the place and said it was a must do.

First off, the service was lacking.  We had made reservations for a party of 6 (for a weeknight) and arrived on time.  We were told by the hostess that the wait was 20-30 minutes.  It seemed beyond them as to what a reservation was for.  Thankfully we only waited 10 minutes before we were seen to our table.

I appreciate what they're trying to do with the lamp lighting but it causes an issue.  No one could read the menus.  We grabbed another lamp from a table that wasn't being used, fished out cellphones and a lighter, then made our dinner choices.  I observed many tables later doing the same thing, so it wasn't just us.

Noise was another issue, as we couldn't hear each other talk.  Now it might seem considering the area and how we were having problems with seeing and hearing each other, that we might be some old grouchy people.  This isn't the case as my wife and I are 30/29 and another couple is in their 40's.

Our waiter showed up pretty quickly but seemed absent several times throughout the night.  They started us off with as many rolls as people and had to ask twice before we got any more.  This was a trend, having to ask for things more than once, as we had to do this for refills (the glasses hold about 1/2 a liter and still went empty), things we ordered that didn't arrive with the rest of our food, and to-go boxes.

Most everyone thought the food was alright, definitely not worth the price tag.  My steak was better in an omelet than as a steak.  Someone else bought dinner for my wife and I and we still didn't think it was worth it.

This is one of the few places I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"It's kind of a neat place. Southwest style food servers in cowboy gear with live country music. The food was good a bit of a bar food menu. They serve rattle snake and sell shirts saying you ate the snake. Between that the live band and the slide inside I'd say thats the draw to it.
Overall pretty dark in there and loud kids kinda run free all over but its one of those places everyone goes to at least once.
Alot of people don't care for the pen beside the front door but we thought it was neat. 
If you are looking for a typical steakhouse this probably isn't the place.
The service was good but can be a little slow, seems hard on the servers just because of how the place is laid out they are walking miles all shift. I'd say It's not them it's the building."}
{"text":"The only draw here is the view of the city lights.  I used to kiss the boys here in the parking lot during college, but now that I can pay to eat here... it ain't all that.  The music is way too loud, we could not talk or hear each other with a group of 8.  And you definitely get 'tourist' feel, especially when you see the buses pull up... though luckily they seat them in an adjoining room away from view.

Get the cutesy steer horn paper hat from the hostess, it was sort of the highlight for our table.  That said, 'nuff said."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Atmosphere, the band, food, and views, and service made this place a great experience. I can't wait to take my friends here! I will be back."}
{"text":"Rustler's is located up on the side of a hill.  This location has great views, especially at nights, and hosts a lot of great events, as well as bands to play.  

The food is sub-par.  My friend and I had the cowboy platter, which is an array of dishes--steak, tuna, shrimp, corn, vegetables, coleslaw, beans, chicken, etc.  The flavor all the dishes that came with this dinner was bland and not good.  The coleslaw, in fact, tasted and smelled spoiled. 

Although it was a lot of food, it is still not worth the price of $25.95 per person.  Bland food, high volume, but great views, good hosts, live music."}
{"text":"I want to like it here... it's a nice view, I love meat! But this is the third time my wife and I have ordered medium rare prime rib and it comes out well done. Still tender... I hate to send food back to waste food or to get it spit in. But come on your a steak destination!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on 5/3, tried to get a reservation for 7 but they will only take \"preferred seating\" whatever that means.  My girlfriend cannot climb stairs very well due to a disability & I was told she could wait downstairs, but would still need to come up once the table was called (?).  

After being seated at 7:15, we ordered drinks & then food.  Their one and only localish beer (Grand Canyon) they were \"out of.\"  When my lady friend asked if green chile's could be put on the side for her burger the waitress said \" I guess so\" my girlfriend smiled and said that'd be great, the waitress said \"that wasn't funny\" and walked away (???).  

The \"authentic Western band\" was playing that well known cowboy trail song \"The Theme From Dukes of Hazzard.\"  Yes, I'm not making this up.

A couple was then seated behind us and within 15 minutes had their food and were eating.  8:10pm our food arrived, a hamburger and a steak.  The couple seated long after us had already eaten their steaks and gone home.  The food was lukewarm and nothing memorable.

After dinner we placed cash with the bill and set it on the end of the table.  The waitress looked at, made eye contact with me, then kept walking.  5 minutes later, she did the same with my girlfriend, another 5 minutes and she did it for a 3rd time with me.  

I normally tip 30% for decent service and 20% for bad.  But this time, I scooped up the tip, left the exact amount for the bill and we left, for the first time in years.  When you open the exit door the lovely smell of fresh cow dung wafts into your nose from the steer they have in a pen nearby for the tourists to do... whatever they do with cows.

There are 20 better steak places I can think of off the top of my head in Phoenix.  If you want an \"authentic\" Western experience, well...try Rawhide in Phoenix or Triple C Chuckwagon in Tucson.  The West from TV is gone and never really existed but you'll have a better time, service, and food at either one than this place."}
{"text":"This is a must see for its views and atmosphere. While you're waiting on your food, you can boot scoot boogie on the dance floor, kids can ride a slide by the front, and you can get some good pics out back.

I was w/ a group. We tried most of the apps...potato skins, fried cactus, fried rattlesnake,  etc. They were just ok, but definitely not if you're trying to eat healthy. 

I'd say go once to say you went."}
{"text":"We love it here! Anytime we're in Phoenix this a must! I love their all you can eat ribs.. The only place I can find fall off the bone beef ribs"}
{"text":"Horrible night. Wife and I got a break from the kids and decided to go to Rustlers Roost. Shortly after being seated, a girl behind us passed out and had a short seizure. Over the next 15 minutes the servers and management did nothing and avoided the scene. My wife and I stood by and didn't know what to do. The parents didn't want us to call an ambulance but pretty sure management should have as soon as she passed out; I would think this to be protocol. 

During this incident, I lost my seat to the girl's father who was taking care of her. The mother was panicking and crying. Her friends didn't know what to do. Why didn't management come out and assist? So strange. 

To top it off, our server let us stand to the corner without a table and didn't once offer to seat us somewhere else. In fact, the server only came by one time throughout this ordeal even with a girl and her father on the floor...

I finally flagged down a different server and asked for a seat since ours was occupied. To top it off, the quality of the food was low and overpriced and they made a bad drink for my wife. I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Entertaining spot for my 6 year old, but the food was bland. We ordered the combo appetizer (wings, nachos, fried mushrooms), filet, and sirloin. All of it was oddly tasteless. We each had two bites of our steak and left the rest. Save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ehhh....just not my thing. Our server was very personable and attentive, but the food is just average at best. It's a nice view and the theme is fun, but I just can't think of any reason to come here unless you have kids. Okay, maybe for the cotton  candy at the end of the meal and the massive slab of chocolate cake for dessert. Definitely more of a tourist attraction, but there are plenty of other restaurants that have far superior food, ambiance, and views."}
{"text":"Horrible steak if you're an actual \"steak person.\" I had the filet, and it was very much below average. The atmosphere is really fun! We took a slide downstairs to eat, and took our drinks out to the patio. I also thought the mason jars were cute to drink out of. But I wouldn't ever come here again (even if it was a free dinner). The food was just...not good."}
{"text":"The view is amazing. Pretty noisy environment so if you are looking to have a quiet conversation or conventional 1st date (I'm not exactly conventional but most people want that), this might not be the spot. Otherwise, it is a fun environment with great food and drinks. It is definitely something different! I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"My mother and I always go here when I am in town. The food is excellent and the view can't be beat!  Last night I ordered the steak and enchiladas and it was amazing! The beans that came with my meal are the best I have ever had... A tad bit spicy, but awesome!  My steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. I was completely stuffed. At the end of the meal, the server brought out a can of cotton candy. Funny... There is always room for cotton candy!  I inhaled it. ;)  The only negative thing that I can say about this place is that the band is way too loud. If you want to have any sort of conversation at dinner, ask for a table away from the band."}
{"text":"Food doesn't have any taste. You only get the view.  French fries are burned and the food was really bad."}
{"text":"Went for a business related dinner with four colleagues on a Monday evening. Three of us ordered the nightly special - a 5 oz prime rib and 3 scallops. I ordered mine rare, and a server brought out all of the meals and set them on a tray, then disappeared. After five minutes our server came to put the food on our table. My rare prime rib was medium well done. After explaining this to the waiter my order was replaced. Instead of prime rib I was given an extremely tough piece of meet - not sure what cut. It was rare, but the quality of the meet was poor. Service was slow and food quality was mediocre."}
{"text":"This has been a Phoenix destination for visitors & natives alike since opening in 1971. It's a gorgeous view year round. The slide is always a blast for the kiddos & adults. If you want to kick up your heels there's country music every night. The restaurant portions are GINORMOUS. On a recent visit I actually shared the burger & ordered a side of the best bacon jalapeno mac n cheese. Every entree comes with biscuits, fry bread & their amazing cinnamon butter, a salad, veggie, beans, corn & potato. So you will not leave hungry. The table also gets cotton candy for a sweet ending.They have beyond giant portions of delicious cowboy food.  Can't beat this for a special occasion with the fam, romantic views for a date night or an event. This place can hit all of the marks for a cowboy steakhouse."}
{"text":"We have been here twice with a large family and we have had mixed experiences which led me to a lot of trouble with reviewing this restaurant.

First of all, lets talk about the ambiance (because that is the reason you show up).  The view is spectacular.  The magician that shows up at the table is amusing and fun - kids love it.  Now the slide.  First time we showed up a year ago, my kids (4, 6 and 8) slid happily for an hour.  The second time there were new rules and a mean woman that yelled at my 30 pound daughter and made her cry (yes, I carried a child out of the rooste crying).  

Food.  Well, its pretty bad - very fried.  The side salad and biscuit were decent.  Everything that followed was overpriced and nasty.  First of all, I had kids that didn't want the normal hot dog and chicken fingers kid's meal so I had to pay $3 for a meal share for each of them (really????).  The steak was not good.  The kid's spaghetti was sent back (and the butter noodles that replaced it were welcomed).

They couldn't bring us the check quick enough and we are done with our annual trip there."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very disappointed with our experience at Rustler's Rooste last night. We were there to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary and our visit there was our first experience at the establishment.

We ordered the big cowboy dinner platter that came with many different options from the menu. Our fried shrimp were burned, the ribs were the same way. The fish kabobs were raw and the beans were cold. The coleslaw, the fresh vegetables and the dipping sauces were warm as if they'd sat under a heat lamp the whole time the rest of the food was being cooked. All of this food was served on a bunch of warm, wilted lettuce that made the dish look unappealing to even eat.

Our waitress did an ok job. She was busy as it seemed like she was attending to too many tables so it took long periods of time to get to us. Not her fault. We should have said something last night but our waitress was so busy that she didn't have time to come over to ask about our meal so we asked for the check and left. 

Having spent $22 per person on this meal we expected much much more. Yes, the view of the valley was great but the meal and the service received a failing grade from us. 

I submitted feedback to the restaurant through their website last night and received a call this morning from the manager. I was impressed that he called me back so quickly. He asked if we would give the place another chance so that they could make it up to us and offered us a VIP experience AT A DISCOUNT.  I called my wife and asked her if she would be willing to go back to which she replied \"No Way\". I asked the manager for a refund instead of the opportunity to return and his response was that they do not offer refunds. I appreciate his attempt to make things \"right\" with a discounted meal if we were to come back but pretty sad that they aren't willing to make things right with a refund. 

I hadn't planned on writing this review until after speaking with the manager and hearing that they do not offer refunds for a horrible experience and that he wanted to have us back for a DISCOUNT, not a complimentary meal. No need to go back and spend more money on a poor quality meal."}
{"text":"The location is cool near the resort giving it a great view of the city on the patio. And the price of the food was very fair for the quality and our server was on top of everything. I would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"This place was a joke from start to finish.  First off, I took my wife here for her Birthday.  I was looking for unique place that had a good view and I came across Rustler's Roost.  As far as the view goes, it definitely delivers.  The place is very cool and has nice \"date night\" atmosphere.  Unfortunately that's where the positive experience ends abruptly.

We were promptly seated at the table and given our menus.  The place is very dimly lit and the menu, for some strange reason, seems to be printed on brown paper.  As a result, you need to use your cell phone in order to read the menu, without holding it directly to your nose.  It was comical to see everyone else doing the same around the room.  Hint: this might be where, oh I don't know, a manager has the menus or lighting changed in order to avoid future embarrassment, but that is small potatoes compared to the issue they have the food and kitchen.

Our order consisted of an app of the Buffalo wings and steak entrees (both me and my wife) with a side of mash potatoes.  The Buffalo wings appeared at the table within 3 minutes of ordering, which immediately had me suspicious.  You guys really can't cook wings to order?  Seriously?  They were soggy, luke warm,  and tasted very bland (this will be a theme).  We actually got our appetizer a full 15 minutes before we got bread to the table.  Was the fry bread and rolls warm?  NO!  Why did it take so long to get out?  Crickets.

I tried to remain positive that the steaks would make up for the starters and bread, but alas I was struck down.  This was literally the worst steak I have ever had in a \"restaurant\", for one very basic reason.  IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO SEASONING!  NONE.  Wow, not only did I ask for it medium and what they brought was rare, but it had zero seasoning.  No salt, no pepper, anywhere.  The plate had a large amount of mushy cafeteria carrots and corn on the cob that tasted like it was microwaved.  Oh and, no seasoning on any of those items either!

I have seen a few positive reviews on this place, and I am dumbfounded.  Our meal came out to $85 before tip and we hardly touched anything on the table.  I took 3 bites of steak, 1 bite of carrots, and 3 bites of corn and that was all could handle.  You would think the waitress would notice that our plates were still full when we asked for our ticket, but she said nothing, which tells me this is a common occurrence 'round these parts.  

I walked in on a date with my wife and walked out dejected, having been robbed of $85 and still very hungry.  I mean for that money you would think I could have gotten at least a little salt and pepper, but no.  Owners/Management need to take a closer look at who's in their kitchen and serving their food.  Or maybe themselves, I'm not sure who's responsible but when you find out, tell 'em I want my $85 back."}
{"text":"I love Rustlers Rooste & I think every person who lives in the valley or visits should go here! We go here every few months and love it!!! The only reason they are getting a 4/5 stars is because every time we go there we don't get the best service, and have to ask several times for whatever we need & it's a tad bit expensive. Other than that it is always a great time, great entertainment, and great food! I'd definitely recommend it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rude hostesses and staff. Also do not say \"60 minutes\" it sounds too similar to \"16 minutes\" pretty common sense but I guess they don't have that here."}
{"text":"First time, last time... Lousy service, overcooked meat, overpriced.  Medium prime rib was shoe leather, the potatoes were cold and hard, and the service was slow and rude.  Even the view can't save this place.  I wanted to free the smelly bull from the shame of working such an awful place.  Beef suppliers should cut these butchers off! It's a waste of meat."}
{"text":"Better people watching. My steak was over cooked but it was cheap enough to not care! A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Be careful of this place. We made a reservation and showed up only to be told that they don't make reservations for parties of our size and that we would have to wait. I even called the morning before to confirm the reservation. Because of this one I our party had to leave before we ate. 

This is completely unacceptable and we will never be back!"}
{"text":"We are staying at the resort and my husband loves steak so we decided to go.  First, there is a cow at the entrance in a filthy, tiny pen and it had a bot fly on his rump that had not been tended to.  Second, we got run over by children playing on the slide.  Third, even though we had a reservation, apparently there was a party later that trumped any attention we would be getting from the hostess.

It was so dark we could not read the menus, even the waitress had to pull out a little flashlight to see what we were talking about.  The salad was pathetic, the Indian flatbread was not.  I got a chewy, nasty little prime rib with boiled carrots and a tiny piece of corn on the cob that had been boiled at least a week.  My poor husband got a tasteless, tough filet, boiled carrots that he can't eat and the same nasty corn that he wouldn't eat.  We got the prickly pear margaritas that were not, then a glass of Merlot that was skunky.

Overall, service was so, so, she probably could not see us.  Food was meh, atmosphere was annoying.  Price . . . Overwhelming"}
{"text":"We don't have the money to come here anymore. But I'm really hoping we can get enough to come back! It's a fantastic atmosphere when you walk in. The parking lot is dumb though. However, never a problem when you're grumbling for a great feast! I was skeptical at first, but the first thing I fell in love with was the bread they bring out. Not the biscuits, but the actual bread itself!! I always want to go back and just get a large order of their bread. It's sweet and just the right amount of chewy, doesn't fall apart. The cotton candy is an added extra ;) it's my fiances favorite place to eat out of everywhere we've been. We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Overhyped place.  We got the rattlesnake and it was  so overbattered, couldn't even taste it...I swear it was just pieces of extra crispy batter.  Our steak and prime rib came out medium well and we asked for medium rare...no good. The only best part was the cotton candy at the end."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Nice atmosphere and free cotton candy after Dinner. Ordered prime rib came with sweet potatoes and half ear of corn variety of breads and family style salad for the table. Also live music."}
{"text":"Good restaurant great view of the city food was good and well portioned highly recommended for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool. Very country western- square dancing included! Haha! The bull outside was cool- it was unfortunate that he was housed next to the front door so as you are walking in to enjoy dinner- you smell bull excrement....not very appetizing if you ask me. The staff seemed a little dull- the hostess was some bored twit curling her hair with her fingers and chewing gum. The waiter was a total ass. He was rude and seemed like he didn't give a shit about his job. The view from the dining room and balcony is pretty amazing-you can see the lights of the city and it looks amazing in the dark. One thing that was not so great in the dark was our table! We sat over looking the huge balcony and view of the city but the are of the dining room we were in was dark. Our table didn't have a light over it so we had to use the light of the oil lamp on the table to read our menus- lame-o! As for food- We got the Cowboy thing where you get a little of just about everything on their menu- its for 2 or more people @ $21.95 per person- a pretty good deal for what you get- there were 3 of us and we all left with our tummies satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  We had a party of 3 and were told the wait was 30-45 minutes. We waited 1.5 hours to be seated. Then additional 15 to have our order taken. The waiter even took someone else's order before us, that sat down 10 minutes after us!!

The food was about 2-3 stars. You're supposed to get bread and salad but we never received our salad. 

Basically this place was a nightmare. Crazy kids running everywhere, service is horrible, food was bland and expensive. I will never, ever, ever return. I'd rather starve."}
{"text":"We were told by staff at the AZ Grand this was the place to go for an excellent steak and to celebrate our anniversary. Nope. Nope. Nope. It took nearly 2 hours to actually get our food and when we did, both steaks were horribly over cooked. Our food resembled camp slop. The \"salad\" was disgusting limp iceberg lettuce drenched in ranch with some croutons and a couple of slices of cucumber. My steak came with an enormous pile of carrots. I don't know a rabbit who could eat that large of a pile of bland carrots.  Our waitress was kind, but rarely present when needed and never offered drink refills. I wasn't inclined to wait another hour for a new steak so I did eat my over cooked steak, as did my husband. I'm a local and was on a staycation, so I really hope this isn't what our tourist think we have to offer. Phoenix has some amazing restaurants, this one is not. It's all a gimmick, tourist trap, eat a rattle snake, etc etc. So many better places to go."}
{"text":"Wen't there for dinner with a group of friends. This is a great place to eat, it's fun and a nice menu with great service with an awesome view of the city. If you like beef this is the place for you.  Don' t forget to take the slide to enter the dinning area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Great views. Live band. Slide for the kids (and adults if you dare). Great food. I recommend the rattlesnake. Besides being unique, it does taste good! I love this place and take all family and friends visiting me to enjoy the view and great food."}
{"text":"First night at the resort and needed something to eat. Got right in and seated as we walked in. Everything was great and the amount of food you get is really good for the price. Myself and my wife both had steaks and they came out exactly how we asked them to be cooked. Everything tasted great and I had no problems with anything"}
{"text":"Visited Rustlers Roost for Mother's Day Brunch. Such a large selection of food. Little kiddos taking turn down the slide: the view is perfect. Love band! Just perfect"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money!!!
I was excited to try this place out, looked pretty cool, sits on top of a hill with nice views. That's where it stops. I had the BBQ chicken and hubby had fried chicken. First they delivered a family served salad that consisted of just iceberg lettuce that had bagged croutons on it with literally only 2 tomatoes and 2 cucumbers. Next a food runner delivered our food and it sat on a tray for several minutes with many staff passing by and not one of them served it. Our server, Amy, was nowhere to be found, in fact she was MIA for most of our dinner. We served our own dinner and then had to move the tray as well since they all continually walked by it and not 1 staff member moved it, ridiculous!!
The food, was disgusting, bland had zero seasoning and the corn and carrots are definitely frozen. I had about 1/4 of my meal only to satisfy my hunger and when the busboy asked if we wanted it wrapped I said no, it was disgusting, he said sorry and that was it. My husband had 3 bites of his fried chicken (which is actually worse then the roasted chicken). The server finally returned to see if we wanted anything else, we said no, she offered to wrap hubby's dinner we said no, and stated it was terrible, then further stated everything was actually quite bad. She said sorry and that was it. Gave us a bill and disappeared. We had to go  to the host stand to actually pay the bill since she disappeared again. 
Neither the busboy or server said anything to a mgr., but I found out why, mgmt. doesn't care either. The GM never apologized, never offered to remove anything from the bill, he only said he would be happy to make us a future reservation, I said no we would never return, he said in a snarky tone \"OK\" and then just walked away.
Don't waste your hard earned money here, go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Positives- view is great! Friendly staff, just clueless on policies and pleasing the customer.
Cons- very confusing!!! You get a different answer to every question depending on who you ask but then it always comes back to no, we cant do that. Food was bad, nothing I would expect at a steakhouse. Both steaks were overcooked!

We went there on a Thursday night as a treat to ourselves. Hadn't been there in years. We had our 2 yo with us since it was kids eat free, we thought it would be kid friendly. Saw that hh is only offered in the saloon upstairs so we decided to have a drink and app before going down to eat. The hostess let us know we could sit at any of the low top tables w/o a reserved sign or any hightop table. We chose a low top by the window because of our child. We sat there for awhile wondering if we had to go to the bar ourselves. Finally a lady comes up to us and says she was sorry and nobody wanted to come tell us but the table we were at was actually reserved. I guess if they have a red napkin it means reserved, the hostess was not aware either. So we ask where else we can sit. She says any of the high tops or at the bar. So I ask again to confirm that there is not a single low top table we can sit at with our 2yo?!? So since they can't accommodate us, we ask if we can get hh downstairs, no. They cannot do that, but we can grab our own drinks now and take them down with us, fine. So we get our drinks and take them to the table. Great view!! Skip ahead to ordering. Be prepared to pay extra if you are a meat and potatoes lover. All dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob. Both were gross! Table gets a dish of cowboy beans that look and taste like they are just a few beans mixed into tomato sauce. My husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot!! A side of any type of potato is an extra $2-5 and hopefully everyone at the table agrees on one because they are huge sides. He ordered his prime rib med-rare and I order the filet med- well. When they showed up, I would have ate his steak! Both were overcooked. Mine had no pink at all but thats fine to me but his was so tough looking for a prime rib and had a sliver of pink only in the middle. In any other moment he would have sent it back but since at this point it was such a bad experience, all we could do was laugh and so he sucked it up and ate it. To top it off, the waiter tried to sneak one by us and charge us for the child meal. When we pointed it out he says,\" oh oops I gave you the old copy\". Ya ok. We will NOT be going back to Rustlers Rooste!!"}
{"text":"My in-laws took my husband and I here to thank us for helping them move. I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and I wasn't disappointed. When you first arrive you're greeted with 360 views of the valley. It's an excellent spot to take some pictures--especially at sunset. 

We were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant after a trip down the slide. We had a great view even though we weren't right beside the window. That was nice. I hate going to a place with great views and staring at the back of the kitchen all night. 

We started with the rattlesnake and cactus fries. I'm glad I tried these unique offerings but I'm not sure I'll try them again. No trip to the Rooste would be complete without them. I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious. My husband had a burger and his parents had pork chops and prime rib. The cowboy beans are the best I've had. Everyone left happy with a full belly and leftovers to spare. The beer is reasonably priced and served in giant mason jar \"pitchers.\" The best part is that every meal ends with complimentary cotton candy. 

This is a great place for families and they have a full bar for the adults. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Phoenix and if you live here, why haven't you visited already?
Say \"hi\" to Horney the Bull!"}
{"text":"First things first- no one is too old to go down the slide! Stairs are for lame, boring people. Who cares if you're almost 30, or 40, or 50. It's fun and a must-do; just don't trample any 5 year olds on the way up. 

Rustler's Rooste is about the experience, people! Do not expect 5-star restaurant steaks. Steaks are fine (a 3.5/5), but you're there for the beautiful view and fun atmosphere. My family has been going here for years, as my mom loves the views at sunset. In fact, we threw my parent's 25th wedding anniversary party here. Staff is fun and they don't over-do the cheesi-ness of the southwest (as in, they're not saying HOWDY PARTNER all night). 

Here's what we like to order: 

Endless Ribs. Say what!?! Yes, endless ribs. And last time we were there, they were only $17. 

Sliced baked potato fries (or whatever they're called). It's pretty much a baked potato, cut into 4, and served with the most delicious ranch ever. 

Someone in your group should order a steak, just because it's a steakhouse. Good, not great, but I've never had bad steak here. 

Most meals come with salad (typical, starter salad), bread (ok bread, but the cinnamon butter is delish), beans, and I believe corn on the cob. 

If you make it for happy hour, they have a good menu as well, and nice bartenders. 

Overall, great value, and a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Complete and total garbage of an experience and restaurant. Horrible service, disorganization from start to finish, long wait of 45 minutes from the time we ordered our food to the time we got our food. Server have is food then said she read ticket wrong and took the food back off the table 3 minutes later.  Appetizers were frozen! Steaks were cold, sides were cold. Our party finally gave up after an hour and the cold steaks. The manager came over to still stick us with a tab we told him there is no way we were paying for such a poor excuse for a restaurant. He handed his card quickly and walked away in a hurry. The one thing that really upsets me is the fried zucchini that was FROZEN. A restaurant that serves frozen vegetables and up-charges the heck out of them? What an absolutely pathetic excuse for a restaurant. Learn to cut a vegetable and fry it for goodness sake. PLEASE spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is fun. The food is good. Not spectacular but always big servings and quality service. Love the view! Never had a bad time.  We have been here several times both with and without the kids.  It's great for family meal or a little date night."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant to celebrate my daughter's birthday this week. Hadn't been here in a very long time but remembered it having pretty good grub. Well times have changed. The staff were all pleasant and the waitress was attentive. 
The food, however, left something to be desired. Steak ordered-not great. Prime rib-fair. Cowboy stuff for 2-a lot of mediocre food served on a cookie sheet. With drinks, the tab for 4 was $220. For that kind of money, I would think they could serve up a decent piece of meat considering this is a steak place. Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place are the views of the city. The food is not that good and the prices are high."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! I had not been to RR for quite some time, but decided that it would be a great place to take my dad for his Bday and mom for Mothers day, two birds with one stone so to say. Had reservations for 6:30PM, didn't get seated until after 7:00. We all ordered the filet and each one came out cooked incorrectly. After notifying the waiter he says he will get us all new steaks. In about 20 minutes, the steaks arrived and were the same original steaks and nothing had been changed on them. At this point I asked for the manager, he comes, grabs the steaks and says \"6 minutes I'll have all new steaks\". While waiting, the sweet potato fries we ordered finally arrived and 25 minutes later still no steaks, I catch the waiter and ask for the check... the manager never did come back to the table. It appears that a restaurant that used to serve pretty decent food is now depending on its view and name recognition rather than food quality and/or good customer service. On a side note, when I made reservations I told them it was my dad's Bday and they said they do something special for birthdays, which I was excited about... I guess the something special is no mention of a Bday and bad food/service. Additionally, the manager never did offer an apology (but the waiter was very apologetic). I will never return to Rustlers Roost and have made sure to pass on to all of my friends, coworkers and employees about the pitiful service/food from Rustlers Roost."}
{"text":"I love me some Rustler's Rooste. It's a nice vacation from the hustle and bustle of city (or in my case, suburb) living. Great place to let loose and enjoy good friends, good food, good drinks, and dancing.

I'll admit, it's a little hokey... but isn't that part of the charm?"}
{"text":"It was good but little pricy for what ya get. The rattle snake was OK wouldn't recommend it. $18 for 10 pieces of snake, a spine and mostly fried cactus. My wife's steak was awesome though!!!! The view is why you go and the cotton candy was a nice touch but probably would pass next time I'm in town. Average is the best word. C+ at best."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday evening for dinner. I had read the reviews and I thought let's try it. 
The view in the early evening was quite nice and since we got there early we had a drink by the windows and enjoyed the view as the light from the day began to fade it was a great experience. It would have been awesome if we could have sat on the patio all night but there was private party down there.. Darn. The people looked to be having a great time down there and it was decorated festively and the grub was looking good :)
The way the tables are arranged inside allows everyone to have a wonderful view and that's how it should be. 
Ok, the restaurant is a steakhouse so for non meat eaters the selection is sparse but I found cheese enchiladas that are a side dish and you get salad and rolls served family style. We ordered the dressing on the side as others have suggested. 
My other half splurged on the porterhouse steak (he was dying for!) and when it arrived it was cooked as ordered. No complaints from his side of the table, lol. My side dish was 2 small enchiladas, so if you are a bit more hungry order 3. They were all right . I will try the veggie burger with veg chili next time.
Dessert? Wowsa! I ordered an eclair since it was for my birthday and that guy is HUGE!  We cut into it  for about \"small\" size servings and still had almost all of it on the plate! Order when you have a large party or eaters. Great part is you can take it home.
There is a band that plays at 6 p.m. and they were pretty good  There's a small dance floor that some people chose to use.  Mostly Mom's and kids and the occasional couple. 
The music is County and on the mellow side , not too wild, not too loud, so I suspect that's to let you enjoy your meal leisurely. 
Cotton Candy.. last had this when I was a teen so we both decided to try it and it was better than we thought it would be when it was delivered when we finished our meal. Not sticky sweet like we both remember. I was surprised. 
This is a place to celebrate an event, take visitors to  and of course enjoy the view with  company you enjoy.
Don't forget to visit Horney the Bull outside."}
{"text":"Second time here and I should have went somewhere else. Both times the food was excellent and both times service was horrible. I came back the 2nd time because I figured I'd give the place the benefit of the doubt. I don't think there will be a 3rd time, and that's a shame because the food is delicious. I think I'd rather go somewhere that values my business and treats me like they appreciate me being there. If you want great food with horrible service, I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a date this Saturday. The only good think about this restaurant is the view. We had a nice view of the city, other than that the customer service was ok. The food was terrible. They did not have lots of options. The buscuits they brought out were not warm and hard. I ordered the jumbo shrimp and they were definitely jumbo. So big they were disgusting, while they were hot the rice on my plate was cold. The best part of my plate was the corn but I mean, you cant really mess that up? My boyfriend got the fried chicken, it looked like an actual chicken cut down the middle and fried. It did not look appetizing at all. Sad to say we left hungry and very disappointed. Will not be going there again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I was completely satisfied with my experience here. 

Positives: really neet place for kids. There is a pretty sweet slide that takes you down into the main dining area, live music in the evening, and beautiful views of the valley. So, the ambiance is fun.

Negatives: In my opinion, the food is NOT worth the price. First of all, you have to pay extra for sides like baked potato. This kind of a side is typically included at most steakhouses. They do serve bread which is super yummy. However,  the salad is a bagged salad,  not at all fresh and tastes horrible. I ordered the prime rib, I liked the seasoning but it was not medium rare as ordered. Like my vegetables, it was overcooked.  The veggies were not fresh and again, overcooked. When you pay$20 for a plate, you expect much more. Our waitress was inattentive and disappeared for a significant amount of time. There is a magician that comes around to the tables which I find annoying and uncomfortable.  I never carry cash, so I just sat there hoping he would skip us which he did.  As he passed by I got a huge whiff of cologne...nothing goes together like Old Spice and steak.  

I will say that my son enjoyed the fried chicken and my husband liked his enchilada and steak plate.  However,  we could have had better food for less at Outback. Bottom Line: you are paying for the experience, not the food. Fun to do once, but $75 was a hefty price tag for subpar food. But hey... you do get cotton candy at the end of your meal,  so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Funnest dinner I've ever had in AZ, truly a destination restaurant :)"}
{"text":"There was an episode of Full House once where the Tanner family dined at a pirate-themed family restaurant that was completely decked out in pirate decor from the waitress' garb to a plank that misbehaved kids could dive off of into a sea of balls. Rustler's Rooste is the western version of this place. A cowboy's dream; a steakhouse for dates and family parties. When you drive up the hill to get to this place, you immediately get the feeling that you're in for a treat. As you walk towards the entrance...and get a whiff of the huge cow hanging out in front, you know this will be quite an adventure. You walk into a cavernous corridor decorated with plastic rock....sort of like the walls inside the Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland. Make reservations, as this is a popular place, or wait at the bar until your beeper lights up. 

On the way to your table, depending on where you sit, you can even choose to take the giant SLIDE down to the first floor. If you're lucky, a live band will be playing country rock jams on the elevated stage right next to the slide and you can high-five the bass player on your way down...this is truly a cheesy place...but at least the food delivers. 

Steaks and bbq are plentiful here, but I cannot recommend their prime rib or their ribeye any higher. Marbled meat that is tender, juicy, and indulgent. Good sides (I opt for the mashed potatoes and each meal comes with a tossed salad, bread, and cowboy beans. Wait staff are incredibly friendly and the view out the window is beautiful-- desert sprawl and Arizona mountains at their finest. Now this is no CUT or BOA Steakhhouse or anything so keep your fancy expectations aside. This is just a darn good place to get your fill of meat, beer, and fun while throwing peanut shells on the ground."}
{"text":"Big massive country bar/restaurant in the hills. It is OK and I'd rate it more towards family fun. A bit expensive and for the money I feel that you could get better food elsewhere.

{"text":"Went to the sold out Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers concert at Rustler's Rooste last Saturday.  It was held out in the big barn, and I gotta say it was a great venue for a concert

I should qualify that.  It's a great venue if you're on the taller side.  I'm 6'2 so sightlines weren't a problem for me, but the stage is only a few feet off the ground, so if you were a shorter person you were kinda S.O.L.

One of the nicest things was how cool it was in there.  There's plenty of AC being pumped down from vents all along the ceiling, and a great breeze coming in.  

And then there's the view again.  Fantastic to step outside for a beer or a break and have the whole valley spread out before you

There was one downside, though I don't know if it's an issue normally.  All the tickets for this concert were Will Call, so there was a ginormous clusterfuck of a line to get into the show because they had to find every freaking person on a printed out list.  If I didn't love RCPM as much as I do, I may have bailed and left

Once you were in though, I loved it.  The Rooste is a great concert venue, with plenty of beer/liquor stations so never a wait for a beverage"}
{"text":"My family and I have lived in Az our whole lives and have been going to Rustlers Rooste since I was young. I even had my mom's surprise 65th birthday party a few years ago which was top notch. 
We recently went with family friends from out of state after not going for quite a while. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the quality this time. My mom and her friends steaks were tough. I think the biggest thing we/I was disappointed with was the main dishes only included (along with the family style ranch salad and beans) was carrots and corn on the cob. There is no potatoes options  to go with especially the steaks and no substitutions were permitted.  We ended up ordering the appetizer potatoes wedges with dinner to have with our steaks. I felt for the price of each dish there should be side dish options, and I feel the carrots and corn which were mediocre and no one at our table either ate or finished.  The salad is made with iceberg lettuce which has really no significant nutritional value.  And I always feel makes for a cheap salad. 
Overall I feel like the cost of the meals weren't justified by the quality of the sides and flexibility of choices.  
The staff were very friendly and as usual it's a fun atmosphere and the view is amazing. Five stars for family entertainment and atmosphere, and staff courtesy."}
{"text":"Fun place and great food.  Prime Rib was excellent!"}
{"text":"What the hell happened?  This place was good back in the day.  Soggy vegetables, corn so over cooked it bent when you went to eat it.  I chewed of my broccoli like it was beef jerky.  And my prime rib was nowhere near a 30 dollar cook.  To finish it off the horse radish was flavorless.  Not even going to guess how long that sat out.  What a disappointment.  I wish I would have made dinner for myself.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear: this place is a gimmick.  It's a corny, western-themed place to take out-of-towners who haven't been to the Southwest.  They do the gimmick thing well, and it is what it is.  If you want an absolutely delicious meal in a pleasant environment, go elsewhere, but if you want somewhere silly to take a family member as a funny 'intro' to Arizona, this will work.

I'm definitely NOT knocking the gimmick thing.  It has it's place and is great for a laugh.  That's where the two stars come from, because they know what they are and you get exactly what you'd expect: mediocre food at a high price while surrounded by heavily-themed EVERYTHING.

As a foodie, though, I do have to knock the prices and food quality separately from the 'gimmick' side of this place.  It's not bad food, but it definitely isn't great either.  Very mediocre.  On the plus side, my steak was cooked perfectly (med. rare) which I always appreciate, but that's about the only thing that stood out as positive.  The salad was way too heavy on the dressing and the biscuits in the bread basket tasted like canned biscuits.  The real downside to this is the pricing...very expensive! It helps to think of it as you're paying for the gimmick experience and the great view, not just the food.  I've heard their cocktails and margaritas are good, so that's a plus.

Overall, come here once when you want to bring out-of-towners, but don't plan on it becoming a regular favorite.  They do what they do relatively well, but it's not really worth multiple return trips.  Come at sunset!"}
{"text":"We were staycationing at The Arizona Grand so we came here for supper. I wasn't expecting much as the reviews were just so so. It was more about the slide and the kitchy-ness really. 

Imagine my surprise when everything was delicious! From the fry bread and biscuits brought before the meal to the well seasoned veggies and the excellent steak! I had the filet and my boys had the porter house and a sirloin cut. Everyone enjoyed their meal! 

They fell short in  few areas. The side of sauteed mushrooms I ordered were not good. They were not seasoned at all. I sent them back. The potato skins we had ordered for apps never showed up. We asked about them and when they showed up they had green onions on them we had asked to be left off. Also, they had wandering balloon sculptors and card trick magicians going from table to table working for tips. It was kind of irritating when they didn't take the hint we were not interested in them coming to our table. 

All in all a solid experience though really. Better than I had expected :)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere and at least worth a visit if you are a tourist. The food is very average and definitely not worth the price. The server was great but hostess was rather moody."}
{"text":"Wow!  The wedding set up was awesome!  Mike is excellent going above and be on the call of duty.  All employees were on the same page making the event run very smooth.  Food and service were great.  Five stars were well earned!"}
{"text":"First time here, some friends brought us here and we had a good time. The food was decent and the staff was very friendly. My only complaint would be the parking. There was a concert here and the line for that was extremely long and full of drunks ! They were blocking the handicapped parking spaces And reluctant to move so we could park. When we did get parked (2 of us are disabled and could not climb the hill) we were accosted by the drunks verbally. 
We had a nice meal and when we came out there were beer cans on my bumper and some idiot had placed a beer bottle behind the rear tire of my pickup. Great behavior for an adult ! 
My wife and I ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" platter and it was decent. I think next time we will stick with a steak though, they looked great and the platter we had was a bit lacking on actual meat. it was more veggies, potato's and filler. Look forward to returning and next time we'll make sure there is not an event going on so we don't have to deal with all of the drunks !"}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars because I think I got food poisoning from here. I have been several times before and never had a problem, but this last time was a bad experience.. We went for my birthday too. I have loved this place every other time I have went. I hope this was a once in a lifetime experience for them. I will be back and hopefully I can keep my delicious ribeye down this time.. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a Californian, but I ate here last Friday night when I was in town. I had only been there once before, in 2006, and it was so memorable that I promised myself that if I ever visited Phoenix again, I'd eat there. 

I tried so hard to convince my friends, who were in town with me, to check the place out, but they were too tired from all of our traveling. Guess what? I went by myself anyway, as a party of one!

The restaurant sits on a beautiful hilltop with a great view of the city. There's a live bull just hanging out' in a bullpen near the entrance...yes, a live bull, literally, just chillin'! The place is at least two stories. You enter on the top level and have a choice to take the stairs down to the first level, or you can take the slide...yes, a slide, literally. I wish I had that kind of setup in my house. It's magical! 

There was a talented live band playing country music on the bottom floor, and there were people dancing. Good times! 

I was pleasantly greeted by the hostesses and promptly seated. I ordered the 12 oz. prime rib w/mashed potatoes on the side. A basket of two kinds of bread and two kinds of butter was brought out to me along with a delicious salad. One minute later, my dinner arrived.

The prime rib was PERFECT! The au jus that came with it was unique and delicious. The mashed potatoes were yummy. I had the biggest smile on my face the whole time I was eating. It was all very reasonably priced and high in quality. I had the rattlesnake the first time I went there. You should try it at least once, and then you can buy a T-shirt there that says you ate the snake. 

The service was EXCELLENT!

Need I say more? Whenever anyone mentions Phoenix, I rave about this restaurant, and I will continue to do so. I'm also impressed by the fact that it's been nine years since I last ate here and it's still as amazing as I remembered it to be. What a glorious dining experience!"}
{"text":"Went after a long time. The Rustlers cut was ehh. Cooked mid rare but not tasty at all for a Prime cut. Salads and breads were Ok. Jake the waiter was superb. Left rather unimpressed with my out of town guest wondering why the hoopla was about this place."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to The Rooste and I was not disappointed (for the 2nd time).  I look forward to seeing Horney on the way in and this time took the slide down to the table. We got there right after it opened on a Monday so we got in right away and didn't have to wait long for our meal either. 

The magician guy was pretty fun and he totally still has me wondering how he switched the coin I was holding with the one he was holding without touching me. I even studied it after the trick and it really was the opposite coin. Crazy!

Our server was Kevin and he was really attentive and down to earth. I ordered the filet (got the same last time) and it was absolutely amazing. Very tender and flavorful. I didn't even use steak sauce which I normally do when eating steak.  I forget which cut my boyfriend got but he did enjoy his as well.  We got green beans and a corn on the cob on the side and we ordered a side of mashed taters which for the 1.79 it cost, was way larger than expected. Although the sides were kind of average, the steak itself is what made us come back for more.  

At the end you get cotton candy! I love it! The ambiance of the place is really rustic and very country. There is a live band that plays there every night I'm guessing (they played both times we've been) and it was actually the same band as last time because I remembered the lead singer looking like Greg Brady, lol.  

The attentiveness was different than the first time we came in (it was a Saturday night) so maybe it had to do with the place not being packed, but maybe not.  I suppose we'll find out next time!

We were seated right next to the window so we got a beautiful view of the valley. Awesome!

I would totally recommend this place to everyone to try at least once."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here for quite a while, since moving to the Valley.  I finally had a chance for my 70th birthday.  The staff seemed very uninvolved with the customers.  They were all matter of fact, without any \"howdy\" greetings.  I never did see any of the staff greet any customer with anything more than \"here's your seat.\"

The food was mediocre.  Both my and my wife's steaks were less than tender.The flavor was good, but not a very good cut.  The veggies were OK, very ordinary.

The rolls were excellent.  My iced tea was weak.

Overall,  a veryunderwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Arrived at 4 with the fam for cocktails. Its a little confusing where you wait until the kitchen opens, but the servers were super polite and helpful when asked, and I can only imagine they direct traffic about 30 million times a night. 

5 stars for prickly pear margaritas, real lime traditionals, and free shuffleboard. I let the bartender: 'Fire' know it was my birthday weekend and my family was anxious about getting a 'good' table and he was kind enough to take pity on us and put our name on the reservations list even though it was a little late for that. A+! 

The slide...its cool! Not sure why parents let their kids play on it like we're at chucky cheese but whatevs....did I mention the margaritas?? :) 

Dinner was delish and served family style. Youre basically picking a meat. Band started and that was neat...a real experience for my out of towners. Servers were friendly and they sang and gave me a cowboy hat and a giant eclair for my B'Day. I love cheese! We will definitely be back. We felt welcome and the view was enthralling."}
{"text":"A couple Novembers ago....

Went with another couple who are strictly meat and French fries eaters ( nothing green, not even green Jell-O).

The big steer at the front door, well, ok. The big slide down to the next level, well, ok. The view of the city! Now you got something.

My date and I had the rattlesnake bits. You could make this your main meal.



The rest of the food was institutional style with no attempt of any elegance whatsoever. Picture, Golden Corral upscale.

One and done, no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Saturday night birthday party and this was the place to be! We were a party of 11 and we were more then ready to take on some good food! 

Being my first time here, I was excited to see what the fuss was all about. We arrived at 6pm and there was no parking in the front of the entrance, so we decided to drive down to the extra parking spaces. We walked up a very steep steep hill and by the time we made it to the top, we were sweating! Ugh! 

Walking towards the entrance you have to come across \"Horney the Bull,\" as he is right by the door to get in. I'm so sorry Horney but you stank!! You walk right on in and you then have to walk another steep hill to go up to where the hostess will tell you where to sit. 

We were pointed to the direction and told where our party was at and so we made it right on over. \"Turn left, then right, then go down the stairs/slide, take a left then keep walking then you will see them on your right.\" We sat down and looked on over our menu. We were brought biscuits (these were as dry as some feet I've seen) and fried bread. (the fried bread was so hard I almost broke my tooth) 

I decided to order the salmon that came with rice pilaf, a corn on the cob, and I got an extra side of mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of the potato skins and my mom decided to give the fried chicken a try. The food looked so delicious and I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, the food had NO FLAVOR. I became great friends with the salt and pepper that night. 

Everything was flavorless. Why? Service was great as our waitress was very attentive. We were there at 6pm so we were able to see the sunset! Beautiful! 

No entree here is less then $16 so keep that in mind. Portions are pretty big but again, the food has no flavor.. we received free cotton candy at the end of our meal! 

Our bill came out to $70.84 for the salmon, potato skins, fried chicken, and two drinks. Come here for the cool cowboy experience, not for great food."}
{"text":"Don't go here thinking its a fine dining steak house for date night. It's cowboy food. My prime rib was cooked as I liked and tasted great. All the other steaks at our table were great. My wife's ribeye was very tasty.  Some of the veggies were overlooked, they could work on improving that.

Staff was excellent. View is awesome. Kids loved the slide, the balloon guy and the sawdust on the floor. Neat place to take your family."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. So the hour wait was not at all a problem. We got drinks at the bar & wondered around to explore the place. We really wanted to try this place for my birthday. We were not disappointed. Even though it was super busy the waiters and staff took their time to ensure you felt focused on vs rushed. Everything came out super quick! Mark & Kevin our waiters were very nice & personable. The vibe is very laid back yet you can get a little dressy if you wanted. I'm from MN & cabins were a big thing growing up. I felt very much at home! Slide indoors for kids is a smart idea!!! Balloon guy and magician also? Heck yes! We were like kids again and loved every min of it. The food was AMAZING!!!! we had the rattle snake, grilled chicken, & endless beef ribs. We will definitely come back. I already text my family and friends bragging about this place! My fiancé & I are very impressed."}
{"text":"Way too strict on the kids menu rule. I eat the same amount of a little kid but I'm 16. Smh. But good food."}
{"text":"Heard about this place but never got there until last night. Oh my gooseness, we had the Cowboy Stuff platter and it was huge. We've done our grocery shopping for the week if not the month with what we brought home.
The price wasn't bad though the drinks are a little skimpy and pricey.
But you are also paying for the view, ambience and service, all which were exceptional.
Just might have to cowboy up and go again."}
{"text":"beautiful view, staff was nice, slide was different but nice for the kids and grown ups, little crowded as far as tables andcspace to move around but they made it work, danfing band playing live jot bad."}
{"text":"You force me to give you 3 stars...

It was good and bad mixed...we will be back because the good outweighed the bad. So here goes.

We get there and go in and are seated right away. 
We were unfortunately sat under the air vent so it was rather chili. We asked to move and they were more then happy to let us. Great..better seat...No freezing. So we waited and waited...finally our waitress comes. Very friendly! We order.

Tatar skins are AMAZING! Get them. They are worth it!

Got saled...very limp...like it had been sitting for a little to long...not great...but we ate it. Well picked at it..

Bread...ok...that Indian Fry Bread...good stuff...the other one...good too!

Steaks...both ordered med-well. Moms was more medium. A little to pink. Ok whatever it was eatable. Mine was well...sent it back cuz it just wasn't good. If I wanted an overdone steak I would make it at home. 2nd one was still A little to done but it was good and I moved forward with my dinner.
Mom said the corn was very tasty and beans were to spicy.
I had mashed potatoes...seemed a bit dry. Only ate about 1/2 of them. Carrots were very good! Cotton Candy was a nice treat!

Overall we left full with tons of leftovers.

The view...stunning!
The staff...Very Friendly.
The music...a nice change.
The decor...very fun!

I wish some of the food was a little freasher for those prices. I also wish they had more info about the history. I had to dig it up online. And it wasn't much.

It's a fun place. I can't wait to drag the whole family there! My kids are going to love trying the slide!

I have high hopes that my next review will be worth more stars!"}
{"text":"Don't you wish your girlfriend was Elite like me? Because if she was, she would have taken you to the OYE which would remind you how awesome and AZ Authentic this place actually is! Rustler's Rooste is THEE place to take out of town guests who need a little wild, wild west.

After attending the last Elite event, I came back a week later for the full Rustler's Rooste experience outside of the hosted event. It was a Wednesday and the place was filled with energy; the tables surrounding the band and dance floor were full of European visitors.

The sun started to set over the Valley as we enjoyed the best fried mushrooms the valley has to offer. The view from the restaurant is unbeatable. Atmosphere and view (and FRIENDLY service) is what gives Rustler's Rooste its 5 stars.

However, the fun truly begin when our dinner arrived. Yes, the Filet Mignon was great, but watching the foreigners learn to line dance was priceless. As we dined and watched, I couldn't help but think about the 'Arizona' experiences these visitors were having - and how something so simple to us very well could be the highlight of their U.S. adventure! Some even had dressed for the occasion with bandannas and cowboy hats. Adorable. As the beer and wine kept flowing the visitors got more brave and started dancing their own mixed version of the 2-step. What a spectacle!

The food fits the atmosphere. It's not fine dining with foams and porcini dust - but - considering the old barn feel, sawdust on the floor, music/band, slide, bull at the entrance (p.s. I also love the new cotton candy in a tomato can touch) I'd say yes - rattlesnake does taste like chicken.

Forget the out of town guests, I'm comin' back when I need a swift reminder of what the wild, wild west means to me!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to eat. Cool place with a great view... and the kids LOVE going down the slide practically the whole time we're there!"}
{"text":"The decor is great. The slide and the bull are perfect to keep kids entertained.  Our service was excellent very friendly and professional. This is definitely a place to bring kids not go on a romantic date.  The food was not good.  Steaks were way over cooked and cold. The beans liked and tasted like they came out of a can. The bread was amazing. It was basically like paying for the experience not the food."}
{"text":"Yesterday eve we arrived  in town to celebrate a birthday and our 24th anniversary.  The food and atmosphere with a great view truly amazing, manager Dan seated the 4 of us where we  enjoyed an incredible view of the lighted city!  My husband just HAD to try the rattlesnake and cactus fries, both were surprisingly good, yes it tastes like chicken!  His souvenir is an 'I ate the rattlesnake' t-shirt!   I enjoyed a fabulous, juicy & tender prime rib, salad and a baked potato with all the fixings.  Their food server, Brian, was attentive, friendly and just great!  What a fun place for a date or celebration!  It looks there was a big event happening out on the very large patio... My husband were very impressed!"}
{"text":"Literally in the middle of our meal right now & couldn't wait any longer to rate the experience... the best part of the meal was the music. The service was terrible, 2 of 5 orders were wrong, took 20mim to correct the order & food was average at best. Its quite unfortunate because we had such high hopes. The manager was \"kind\" enough to hear me out on my complaint, but his resolution was his business card, so that I could call him next time for a better experience.  But hey they have a nice view of the city..."}
{"text":"Of all the steakhouses in Phoenix this is probably the worst. I was staying in the Arizona grand hotel and the rustlers roost as part of their property. I saw they had fillet on the menu and asked the waiter if this is filet mignon.  His answer was it doesn't come wrapped in bacon so I assumed he was clueless. I ordered it anyway and was extremely disappointing. It was a piece of shoe leather steak that was tough.  Of all the great steak houses in Phoenix I unfortunately chose this place. Needless to say on my next trip to Phoenix I won't be going there again and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Came here for my graduation dinner and was extremely upset. The quality of food was terrible. Was served soiled steak, our platters came out cold, and wings were undercooked. There was 10 of us and only 2 people ate their food somehow we still had to pay almost 400 tab. Don't get me started on the tab. One couple split their food off and the server took their payment and still tried to make the rest of the group pay that tab. Luckily I took pictures of tabs, server ripped them off the table before we even had a chance to calculate. He stood over my shoulder while waiting for me to sign. When brought to the managers attention he told us the server has been with them for 10+ years. Nothing was done. No one but the 2 touched their food. Now my husband has food poisoning from spoiled steak. Also there's 3 extra charges on my account. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the steak. Have never been before so I had the tbone and the other 2 with me had the rib eye. All steaks were tough and not much taste. Thought about sending it back but figured if they were all so bad the next batch would be as well. Listening to others as they left they were saying the chicken was good so maybe they were locals and knew Not to order steak. I would never come here and order steak again. On the plus side the views were nice."}
{"text":"Scenery was great. The place is well worth the cost of the dinner. Steak was great but salad and rice was normal. Atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Worst ribs I've ever paid money for. All caked up with god knows what and half fat.  They were all you can eat, so I should have been wary I suppose. 

Nice view, but nothing spectacular.

Free cotton candy dessert, which was fun."}
{"text":"An experience not soon forgotten. My fault for not researching more I guess. If you have kids and enjoy sub-par steaks - this is your dream come true! The place was a total madhouse!! Balloon hats, a magician stalking tables for tips, explosive cakes, intruding photographers that let you buy a photo on the way out, and of course - cotton candy to go. The food was slow to come and SO BLAND, cocktails weak and bottom shelf. If you need your kids to be expensively entertained while you can't enjoy a drink or steak this is your place! If you don't have kids or enjoy a circus you'll get a better bite at longhorn!"}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of people and was easily accommodated. The service was great and the atmosphere was outstanding. Unfortunately the food just wasn't that great. My steak was very dry and the vegetables were mushy. Maybe the cook had an off night I don't know. If you specialize in steak you really need to cook the steak right. Would I go back, sure I would. The atmosphere and service warrant a second trip to give the food another try."}
{"text":"Fun, entertaining environment. Definitely take the slide down into the restaurant. Live music, bull outside to check out. We tried the rattle snake, it was good definitely would have it again. Macaroni was delish! The staff is friendly, great to ask for menu choices if you have never been here. My husband and I had the half chicken. Very good with great flavor. If you can sit next to the window or outside for a great night/day view of the area."}
{"text":"We went to rustlers rooste on Saturday night. We went to the bar and had drinks while we waited for our table. Are bar waitress was very busy but took excellent care of us. When we were seated at our table we had a great view outside of the Valley. The four of us all ordered steaks and they were cooked to our request. Our waiter was very busy but stopped by several times to make sure we had everything we needed.
The restaurant was very full, there were many families there and it was pretty noisy inside."}
{"text":"Went here based on a recommendation from a fellow Yelper, and glad we went! The Steak was real good, same with the beer. 
Basically here is the warning, if you come here, you better come here with a Cowboy appetite! The portions you get are pretty good size (I didnt get it, but saw they have a 2 pound steak!) the service is real good, and prompt, they had a live (I guess its better then a dead group? LOL) Country Music group that I thought was pretty good. The only negative I can find with this place is that its a little dark inside, so had to have wife use her phone flashlight in order to get the pictures here.
A huge plus in my books, is that they have Pepsi products, but this time went with a Beer, and it was the blonde beer from some brewery (I forget the name)"}
{"text":"Straight up the worst food I've ever had. Great location and views but that doesn't make up for the terrible food."}
{"text":"I don't know if there are words for how much fun this place is, so I'll just give a quick rundown of the evening of awesome. We had to park in the bottom of the hill parking lot but they have a shuttle that we didn't take. Take the shuttle if you aren't wearing sneakers.  We showed up (6 of us) around 7 and were told it would be an hour wait.  After 15 minutes they had a booth for us. We walked past the live cow and got to take the slide downstairs. The hostess waited for us at the bottom of the slide. It was a booth that fit all 6 of us easily and we are not little petite people. The only drinks on the specialty menu had tequila but the das boote was recommended as a particularly girly drink. It is supposed to taste like melon but it tasted like Jello and came out on fire and you get to keep the boot glass! We ordered rattlesnake as an appetizer and it tasted like fried whitefish. It came with the snake's spine?
4 of us ordered the Cowboy Stuff where you get everything for $22. Then the balloon man Frank came to the table. Even though we were all adults he made us balloon animals. He was fantastic! I got a giraffe with a different colored mane. My friends and BF got a T-rex, a monkey with banana and a motorcycle. I went outside to get a close up of the views and by the time I got back  our table was filled up with cowboy stuff. The sauce on the meat was delicious and the seafood was well cooked as in tasty. The potatoes made me feel as if I had died and gone to carb heaven. The beans were bland and the pineapple coleslaw disturbing but if that's the worst I can say about a place is that two of their sides weren't my favorite then I think it's all right. My friends that didn't order cowboy stuff got ribs. Deliciously tangy sauce with a little bit of heat.
I was originally terrified by the idea of their live band as usually those are so loud you can't hold a conversation but they had their own section and rocked out.
There were a lot of kids around but none I would consider obnoxious. They seemed to burn off their over-stimulation riding down the slide and going up the stairs again. Our server was incredibly fast and somehow managed to see our drink glasses  through all of the stuff on the table and keep them filled.
Basically it was fun enough we plan to come back within a month to celebrate a friend's birthday with a giant hat and an eclair the size of her head. Well worth it and the views from our table were incredible."}
{"text":"First, let's start with a few positives....
Great view!!! Yesterday, I was very disappointed in Rustlers Rooste! We made reservations for 5 pm, arrived at 4:45 and did not get seated until 6:20 pm. Many families were in same boat! It was a chaotic scene yesterday! Service was horrible, mashed potatoes were WAY too salty and pumpkin pie was super soggy / sugary! The only thing they got right was the turkey and yummy salad. For next thanksgiving, please honor your reservations! People don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes... But really an hour and a half??? You got the view going for you but that is about it! A total disappointment Rustlers Rooste... Why?"}
{"text":"Second time here. Go at sundown. Beautiful views. Love the atmosphere, but im pretty simple country guy. Got the filet mignon. Although not the best steak I had for 24 bucks you get bread, salad, steak, potato, corn, carrots, and baked beans. Pretty solid. Beer in mason jars. Just a fun local place. I'll always come back when I visit"}
{"text":"Awful...just awful, go somewhere...anywhere else the food is horrible!  The service is just bad too, rude waitress."}
{"text":"Came here on Sat right at opening (5pm) parking lot was already full, but there was no wait. Right when we walked in, we were sit & our 8 yo had fun sliding down, I wore a dress, so I took the stairs :( 

I was very nervous to come here because of a few bad reviews, but decided to come anyway since we were in the area. I honestly was preparing for the worst but everything was great! 

Our sever served as water right away and after taking our orders he served us a bread basket, my son loved their sweet cinnamon butter spread. Then we were served their house salad, which was also really delicious. 

Our food came out pretty fast, I ordered the Garden burger and finished the whole thing, it came with a very small size of their vegetarian chili which was very flavorful but I was hoping for a cup sized not a sample size, it also came with lots fries, which I did not really care for fries. They were not crispy or any flavor. 

My husband got the bbq ribs, he loved it! He finished the all the food on his plate, it came with a corn on a cob, carrots, n bbq beans. 

My son who normally don't eat, ate most of his meal (huge consider it was a kids meal) he have giant chicken tenders, fries, and a slice of fruit! He also loved the complementary cotton candy at the end. 

I'm so glad we came here, even though I was feeling discourage by a few bad reviews."}
{"text":"We went here 2 months ago. Really nice view of the valley. The service was good, the food was ok nothing spectacular. Prices were ahh, there were a lot of kids there so you hear kid noise. Differently not a date night place, unless you don't mind kids running around. 
Although the cotton candy was a nice touch. That's something you never see at restaurants."}
{"text":"Location, location, location. The view is the draw for this cowboy themed restaurant that has been around for years! From the restaurant or the huge outdoor areas, overlooking Phoenix and the mountains is special.

The food is good. The honey butter and rolls were a nice touch. Steak was good but nothing special.  Did I say the view was special??

You enter the restaurant by sliding down a huge slide which is really fun! The staff are dressed as cowfolk and the decor is cowboy themed. It's nice but nothing special.  Did I mention that the view is special?

Summary: go here for a SPECIAL VIEW of the beautiful mountains and downtown valley of Phoenix. If you know what you're going for, you'll LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"So I must have been on something the first time I went here... The second time around was a joke. The rattlesnake appetizer is a fun idea but it's mostly fried cactus and way overpriced. Our server, Brian, looked as though he would rather be dead than working there, and I frankly don't blame him. We never got rolls when we first sat down, which isn't a big deal, but we were watching other tables in the section eating them, so....? I ordered my steak medium-well (I know, I'm a monster) and it came to me rare. I mean, RARE. I had to wait about 10 minutes for the server to come back around only to get back a hockey-puck of a steak. The baked beans are disgusting, the green beans were terrifyingly overcooked and the carrots were.... well, it was all just gross.

It's an overrated hillbilly Disneyland type of themed restaurant and I won't be making this mistake a third time. Shame on me."}
{"text":"Rustlers rooste pork ribs are absolutely amazing.   I get those every single time.  If you go, you must get the cow pie.  Absolutely delicious.   Rustlers rooste is very family friendly. There is a huge slide for the kids enjoyment.  There is also baloonatics and magicians that go around to your table and entertain you.   It's extremely fun and I highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars I would. The service was awful the entire 3 hours our party was there, both at the bar seating and throughout the dining portion. We knew what to expect going in the atmosphere, it has such a fun and friendly environment but the service, again, was awful."}
{"text":"My family had a great time! The food was great. The view was amazing. The smile on my little boys face sliding down the slide over and over was priceless!"}
{"text":"If you have kids, this is a great stop.  If not, you might want to re-think heading to this joint.  

As you walk in, you have a big ol steer in a pen right outside the restaurant.  The kiddies like it so its worth the smells.  Checking in with the hostess has always been an issue and it was no different this time around.  It was about a 30 minute wait for a table and a bit unorganized to get your name in with the waitress.  

If you can get a table along the windows, you will get a fantastic view of the valley, sunset and the air traffic into Sky Harbor.  Worth the trip just for the views.

Once you get buzzed that your table is ready,  you get to walk down steps or take the slide to the dining level.  The slide is a zoo with lots of kids...and some adults who act like kids...so that is part of the fun.  

Live country music and a smallish dance floor and sawdust, a classic touch.  This is not your new country music. You will get your Johnny, Willie and Waylan which is the way I like it.

Decent menu with options for the kids.  I ordered the 16 oz. Prime Rib (Marshall), medium rare.  The meal comes with bread/butter before hand.  Family style salad and cowboy beans as the first course.  And corn on the cob & green beans with the entree.  The prime rib was every bit of 16 oz, but it was over cooked.  More toward medium than MR.  That was disappointing, especially since 1/4 of the front page of the menu was taken up describing how they cook their meat.

The sides were OK.  I think they are making a mistake by serving the meal on a plate with a metal cover.  Condensation builds up on the inside of the lid and drips onto to the entree.  It just make everything soggy.

The service was good, although I had so many plates at my smallish table, that i ran out of room to put things.  For a table of four, (two of which were kids under 3) I had 9 small plates.  We had a stack of them left on the end of the table for about 10 minutes before someone stopped by to pick them up.  Just a weird experience.

There is also at least two people walking around making balloon animals, for a small fee.  These guys/gals are fun and kids certainly got a kick out of it.  

Lastly, we were offered cotton candy as we left.   Definitely something my 3yr didn't need, but it was a nice touch.   

Overall, the food was a 2, but the experience was a 4 especially for the kids....so they get a 3 from me."}
{"text":"Get a table outdoors so you can 1) see the valley view and 2) hear the person sitting next to you 3) see your menu by daylight.  If you sit inside and you have a group you will be seated with other groups and it is NOISY and DARK and you can't really see the valley.  I played it safe and didn't order steak because the reviews were so bad; I had the Garden Veggie burger which came on a white bread bun with tomato, lettuce, something I couldn't identify because it was so dark in there (they were beans) and then some overdone french fries.  

As a group we got a huge bowl of salad which would have been better without a creamy dressing but it redeemed itself because there were cukes and cherry tomatoes.  Our waiter never refilled drinks and getting someone's attention in a dark, noisy place is hard.  I can't believe anyone would rave about this place.  No one in our group raved about their prime rib."}
{"text":"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. 

Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. 

You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. 
First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. 
From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. 

Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. 

Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. 

While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. 

The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. 

All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. 

I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste."}
{"text":"Can we post with no stars?! Honestly, this place is the worst. It was not only my table/party, but the entire crowd that came in! We each experienced terrible customer service from the getgo by having to read a sign and find limited seating while waiting for Sunday dinner. So we sat in the wrong section apparently for about 5 min and finally got fed up and asked the bartender what's up. He said we're seated in the wrong section and no one will be helping that section. So, we moved into the small area that was open.. they never closed off the other section and we watched other people sit there and do the same. So we sat and were treated as if we were the worst. We managed to obtain drinks and an appetizer, but with no silverware, plates or napkins... so I grabbed our own. Again this wasn't just our table but everyone that came in. With that in mind, we didn't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"For years I heard about this place and always wanted to go, so I thought for a \"date night\" it would be a nice change of pace. 

First off, the cell phone GPS got us lost. It took us through a community and right to a locked gate. I could see the restaurant on top of the hill but could get to it. I ended up calling the restaurant and spoke to a confused young girl. She didn't understand how I could be lost and had no idea houses were right below them. 

After a few minutes of searching, I located the place. The parking lot was packed (it was Saturday night) but there was a nice gentleman there with a shuttle to help us to the top of the hill. 

The restaurant itself is pretty rustic. There's a huge long horn steer outside, so the smell was a little strong but manageable. Inside was a live band and unique designed layout with a kid slide and all. 

We had a nice window seat which overlooked the city lights. The view was great and so was the friendly staff. The issue I had the most was with the food. 

I was not impressed to say the least. We ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" which was basically a sample of ribs, chicken, fish, shrimp and filet mignon. The sides were potato wedges, spicy baked beans, pineapple coleslaw , corn on the cob and a side of veggies. The meal also came with rolls, biscuits and a salad. Overall cost was $47 and with a tip, about $55 total for the two of us. 

Everything was pretty bland and nothing that stood out as great tasting. I would much rather have gone to Pork on the Fork, a local BBQ place two minutes from my house. Instead I drove 40 minutes across the valley for this? Very disappointing to me. 

If it wasn't for the cool atmosphere and helpful staff, I would give this place a two star rating. Save your money and enjoy something close to your house instead."}
{"text":"Rattlesnack appetizer delicious! For entree filet medium rare and jalapeño mac and cheese. Good but nothing out of this world. Dessert cotton candy!"}
{"text":"Been sitting here going on close to 2 hours now & barely received salad. Salad is plain lettuce with minimal ranch. Gross. Please do not come here expecting great & speedy service. 
Oh & only had 1 refill of water, so been sitting here close to 2 hours without any water either. Only come here for the view, please. Horrible food, horrible service."}
{"text":"Great place for out-of-towners!  This is the atmosphere they are expecting when they first get to the Valley of the Sun.  Many folks are shocked when they learn there is more than just cacti and cowboys here is the desert.  Once they get over it, I find it fun to end their trip with the vision they had in mind when they first arrived.

Ever since I was a child, I have enjoyed waving hello to Rustler's Rooste official greeter, Horney T. Bull, before walking up the ramp to the hostess stand.  Another staple is the slide to get down ground floor, hours (OK, minutes) of fun for children and adults alike.  Sawdust on the floor, country band on stage, probably some two-stepping going on the dance floor, and a spectacular view of the valley.  Oh, and don't forget to get your picture taken with your face as Horney or a cowboy (be sure to check out mine too)!

At my first Yelp event, I won a $50 gift certificate to come back to the Rooste.  We decided to use it on one of my favorite holidays . . . Christmas Eve-Eve (December 23).  Long story . . .

We started out with the fried rattlesnake.  Tasted like chicken, yet a little chewy like calamari.  The mini fry breads they brought out before the entree were one of my favorite parts of the meal.  The salad came pre-dressed with a ton ranch, but c'mon this is Cowboy food, what do you expect.  I ordered the Mixed Grill with fillet medallions and sautéed shrimp.  The portion wasn't huge, but it was enough to fill me up, and it tasted good, so I was happy.

I have also been to the Rooste for happy hour more times than I can count (way before \"check-ins\" were around, so I don't have the stats to prove it).  This is for sure an Arizona classic and will always have a special place in my heart.  From childhood fun, to family gatherings, drunken sliding during happy hour and Yelp events, I've had a blast!

Thanks again to Yelp for the $50 gift certificate I won at the Hoe Down and thanks to the Rooste for providing that cowboy atmosphere when we need it!  YEE HAW!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go eat prime rib! Service and staff are very attentive and friendly. The house salad they served also very good. Cotton candy is served after the meal on most days! And there's a slide!!"}
{"text":"Awesome family fun

We walked from Arizona Gand Resort and I was surprised that I had been here 5 years ago on a work event.  Fun with a live bull at the entrance. .  
Kids menu makes a bull hat.  There where games and best of all a slide for the kids. 
The country band was great.  
Reasonable prices and great steaks!!!! 
Our entire family had a blast and we are debating returning tonight.  
Also service was the prompt and attentive"}
{"text":"Had heard mixed reviews of this place. We had friends come in from out of town and decided this would be a great place to try with them. WRONG. The view is spectacular! The food is eh. Salad is ice berg. I felt things were overpriced, but that is my thought. Service was lacking. Dh loved the cotton candy for dessert, but that was the most memorable thing. Next time we will just visit for the view and dinner will be elsewhere. The most amusing thing that night was watching a stretch limo try to navigate thru the parking lot."}
{"text":"We have been going to RR for decades,  we used to only grow with out of town guests but have started going more often because the more than fill you with a great view, food and even some fun.  Always busy,  make a reservation."}
{"text":"We went here Labor Day weekend with my mom and dad.  Mom is now in a wheelchair, so getting around has become a little more challenging.  The restaurant is located way up on a hill, and walking inside is a chore for her.  There aren't any steps, but just because someone isn't actually in a wheelchair (she can walk small distances), doesn't mean they can walk up very steep ramps.  When we finally got up to the check-in desk, we were told that our table would be located on the bottom level.  We requested a table on the main level, because I didn't think my mom could make it back down that ramp.  They were very kind and changed our table.  The food was ok - think of Rawhide without the town - food is basically the same.  You go for the food and atmosphere - not just the food.  Steaks were cooked correctly, drinks were refilled and service was attentive and pleasant.  If it weren't for the hastle of trying to get my poor mom up and down the ramps, we would probably come again, but sorry, just not worth it - once was enough."}
{"text":"What a great place! If you want some down-home cowboy cooking - this is the place! They offer live country music most nights and the view is spectacular! The prices are a little high for the steaks, but, we thought they were worth it. The portions were just right and the service was friendly & efficient.

This restaurant is definitely a must see! It is half tourist attraction and half road house. Give it a shot cowboy!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the western atmosphere and music. The food is really good and the servers are very considerate and attentive!
After dinner the views are unreal with great photo shots available!!
I will always put a visit to this rooste on our next visit for spring training"}
{"text":"brought the family here during the holidays! Called to reserve a spot on the call ahead list and so glad we did! Spectacular views, great service, great food!!! Love the slide for the kids (or adults too)! And the cotton candy they give you afterwards made for one happy child! We will definitely continue to dine here!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun!!! Always bring our out of town guests here...impressed every time!! Last nite was no exception, brought my parents, sister and uncle/aunt. We were seated in Sandy's section. What a wonderful, friendly and attentive lady!!! She was so great we are compelled to call the manager (Tom) over, who was another gem!!! Sandy made our nite....when you go, ask to be seated wherever she is...you won't regret it!!! Great spot, great service, good food....definitely an experience. Thanks Rustler's Rooste...you never fail to deliver and you make my parents happy..so that's even more brownie points. 

Sandy you're the best..keep up the great work...we appreciate you!! :)"}
{"text":"Cute for kids with live steer, line dancing, cotton candy and atmosphere.  Kind of gimmicky.  Food was expensive and not very exciting.  You are paying for the atmosphere not the food.  Food was not worth price."}
{"text":"Simple math....  When four groups of people go out to dinner and all want to pay their portion of the bill, one would think that could be accomplished.  Much to my surprise when our checks returned and each and everyone of us had been charge incorrectly we realized we had a problem.  To make matters worse a \"manager\" came over to \"help\" and insulted the young men and women at the table and was very condescending; if he only knew that each one of the young people have professional jobs as pilots, teachers, and brewery managers.   And to further insult them in front of their parents and grand parents - very bad customer service.  Too bad, this place has SO much potential, it really is a Phoenix ICON, yet it has lost something - it is now just a cheap imitation of a steak house, with poor customer service, catering to tourist.

I would like to add a positive, the General Manager did attempt to make things right and did his best to sort the mess out...  I compliment him on his effort at trying to make things right, too bad he even had to do that in the first place...

The food was eeh, the appetizer of rattlesnake and prickly pear fries was the best part of the meal..."}
{"text":"Touristy, gimmicky, and great for kids- but definitely worth a go to try rattlesnake!  Most enjoy their first time but wouldn't prefer to go again.  Firstly, you walk up to a stinky cow at the entrance... Not a great way to kick start an appetite if you ask me.  After holding my breath and being led to our table, there is a slide you can take down instead of a short flight off stairs.  So bring out the inner kid by sliding down (and later finishing with some free cotton candy dessert).  The view is pretty spectacular and we had the pleasure of dining come sunset.  Our pictures looked like they were already instagrammed with the way the lighting hit.  The food- worst free bread I think I've ever had, no fluffiness, no texture, hard and cold.  The rattlesnake was super chewy and honestly you get more crunchy fried batter than snake in each bite.  The presentation is awesome with the rib cage for sure.  I'm just wondering if they have someone out on then hill hunting them or what?  Definitely the closest I'd ever get to a snake by choice.  Anyways, I had the prime rib special which was pretty delicious and average.  The mashed potatoes and the jalapeño Mac and cheese though were definitely something to write about.  The Mac n cheese was a perfect balance of crunchiness and a little kick without being too cheesy or liquidy.  If you decide to order mushrooms on your steak, it's a huge portion so I'd recommend sharing one order amongst the group.  Finally, the cotton candy... Such melt in your mouth goodness.  It didn't melt or stick to your hands and it's spun perfectly so you can actually tear off layers.  I don't think I can ever go back to squished, prepackaged, overpriced ballpark cotton candy again..."}
{"text":"Save your money.  Mediocre and overpriced tourist trap. Food was boring. Service was lacking. Too noisy."}
{"text":"Was rather disappointed with the food. I realized that it was \" touristy\" and being as though we were doing a staycation we thought we would give it a try. Service was friendly and atmosphere was fun, but the food was way over priced for the substandard quality."}
{"text":"Had a private event there this past weekend and everything was FANTASTIC! The food and service was top notch and every guest LOVED it! THANK YOU RR!!!"}
{"text":"Rustic restaurant with amazing view of the city! I had dinner here with a very good friend. We ordered marinated boiled swordfish and beef ribs. Each meal came with 2 sides, salad, bread and butter. The portions were very big and very very well done! We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated but we were able to enjoy our meal at a table next to the window with all city lights right there. There is a band playing country music, a fun slide and pleasant atmosphere in this restaurant. I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding. The food was great, the service was great, the drinks were great. 

We ate outside and the view was spectacular. 

I'm a little bummed I missed out on the infamous slide, but next time for sure. 

My biggest issue was parking. Even on a Thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a spot. It was tough because our car contained a toddler, and a 7 months pregnant woman and we has to hoof it pretty far. Maybe a shuttle service from lower level parking would help."}
{"text":"We went there because our sons wanted to try fried rattlesnake. They were not disappointed in that regard. The atmosphere was fun. There was a live C&W band. The band was great. People were dancing. Children were playing. Most people seemed to be enjoying themselves, including us. These are the positive points. The negative points include the quality of the steaks, the seating, and the service. The steaks were expensive, of poor quality, tough, and with poor taste. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped. The lighting was poor. It was difficult to read the menu. The service was poor.

This place is fun for a one time visit. We made our first visit, enjoyed it, but will not be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for the kids but everything else was horrible.  This was our second time going here.  We waited 10 minutes just for a server to come to the table.  The ribs were cold, corn on the cob seemed to have been cooked all day, medium steak was cooked extra well.  Not once were the water glasses refilled and dirty plates were never cleared.  Unfortunately it looks like other people had the same experience."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately. Waitress was very friendly and attentive, double barrel margaritas (~$10) were well made and had a good balance of acid, sweet, and booze. We tried the rattlesnake because it seemed like the cool thing to do. The taste and texture was similar to frog legs mixed with chicken. It was fried which pretty much makes any protein taste the same. The accompanying fried mushrooms were tasty. 

Pretty much our whole table got the bone-in ribeye (~$26 IIRC). The steaks were cooked to the right temperature, but were not seasoned well. The meat was good quality, however a little salt and pepper before grilling would have gone a long ways. 

The strangest thing was \"VIP\" parking where someone directs you to a parking space and indicates that they work on tips. Not a valet, just someone pointing you to a spot and telling you that they expect a tip. 

Overall I wasn't too impressed and have no plans to return."}
{"text":"How many restaurants have a live bull walking around outside the restaurant?  This place is crazy and lively, without a doubt.  If you're taken to the dining area downstairs, you can forego the stairs and go down the slide.  Fun for the kiddies (and adults).  They have a baloon guy making animals, swords, hats, etc for free.

The portions are HUGE!  Enough to share with 1 or 2 other people.

The outside seating area is the perfect place to get a great view of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  I first enjoyed the Rooste in 1983, when I'd flown out for a job interview.  Great steak, great view.....a highlight of my trip.   Moved my family out here a month later.

Fast forward to May 5th, 2018.  I made early reservations as we were bringing another couple and the wife was celebrating her birthday.  When making the reservation, I opted for an add on birthday surprise for my friend.  Hat, cake and staff singing to her.

The service was horrible, the food was worse and to top it off, there was no mention of the birthday.
Large salad placed on our table when appetIzers were half finished.  When we began our salad, our entrees were brought out and placed on a waiters table next to us.  The $28 bone in ribeye I ordered was tough as shoe leather, full of gristle and barely above room temperature.  The filets that were ordered were as bad.  My wife's 8 oz was raw in the center and temperature was almost cool.  I can only imagine how long those steaks sat in the kitchen before being brought out.

While Rustler's Rooste was once a place I would bring out of town guests, it has become an overpriced restaurant with lousy service.  No, I didn't complain to mgmt.  They should know the quality and temperature of the food they serve.  They've obviously lost track.   No doubt this was my last visit.   Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"FUN vs. FLAVOR
( the lowdown on Rustlers Roost)

1. They do not take reservations!  What they do take is ONLY a call ahead. 

Apparently, guest are viewed like cattle they need an estimated number of how how many are coming so don't expect to be seated for a while even with a call ahead. But like good cattle hearders they real then in and out pretty darn good.

2. This place gets  stars on fun but not food- at best mediocre. The nearly foot long piece of cake adds to the table fun and is generous on the calories. 

3.Atmosphere -The American stage with live western style music, the games, the  \"honey bull\"  that sits outside watching guests leave, the motif -  rustic and the well thoughtout option of stairs or a slide for those who may have endulged in a drop or two too many of the libations seated on the second floor was genious or a suggestion of a seasoned drinker.  Lastly, the spectacular view from the patio provides a lasting memory that will impress any guest 

4. Staff with an attitude - reminiscent of  the Old West as portrayed by Garrison Keillor stories In the Lives of Dusty and Lefty. They are true American Characters.

5. Cleanliness - ABOVE average from what I saw on July 4th 2016 while they had served 1,700 people that day it was very clean.I couldn't find a dirty spoon or glass and I pride myself on spot checks. 

6. Management approaches you with caution like a Sheriff from an Old Western Town that John Wayne might have played portraying a sense of fairness with a reasonable but not too accomodating attitude.

Passerby and Locals alike need to come here at least once to  experience a bit of The Old West and Tourist to Arizona need to ink this into their itineraries.

Price is about a 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona
I frequented Rustler's Roost over a few decades.  I have since moved to Portland, Oregon and wanted to share the experience with my kids.  After reading all of the negative reviews we almost didn't go.  I was worried it would cost a fortune and leave me feeling unsatisfied.  So glad I rolled the dice.

My husband and I arrived with a small army of kids: 2 little guys and 6 teens. Yes we travel with 8 kids. Lol.  

We all loved it.  Drinks (with refills) bread and family style table salad came out quick.  While we waited we got up danced to the live music and went back down the slide.  Portions were ample.  Even with 4 teen boys we couldn't finish it all.

We hit the jackpot with our server, Bobby.  He has was warm and friendly.  He managed the table like a pro.  He took our order with no notes and nailed it!!! For all 10 of us.

I ordered the combo platter with ribs. Super good.  But the real home run is their bacon and jalapeno mac n cheese.  It's a side and only $5.95.  I could have made a meal out of it.

A couple of my boys ordered the hot wings.  An appetizer for $9.95, they couldn't eat all 12 of them.  

Don't listen to the nay sayers. This is still a place to go.  Ask for Bobby Brown's section.   

We ordered drinks for all kids,  3 margaritas and 10 meals. Our total was less then $250 with a 20%+ tip.  Where can you have fun and eat dinner at a unquie place for that?"}
{"text":"First Time here, not only was the food delicious BUT the young lady who helped us out AMBER was seriously so nice kind welcoming and made us feel right !! Thanks Amber for your help! When the server is nice the food tastes even better. Can't complain about this place. I seriously even loved the smell of the Bull they had out side lol. I wish there was a place like this back home in LA."}
{"text":"This review is for the newest waitress at this establishment. This was my daughters 4th birthday I read plenty great reviews on this place to help me choose this place to be her birthday dinner. We walk in see the bull the kids were excited we took the slide down to our table they absolutely loved that and then we get to our seat... We sit for awhile (10 min) waiting for someone to come over and the girls have to go to the bathroom so they leave to handle that I sit for another 5 minutes before the new waitress stumbles by and finally notices me. Asks what I'd like to drink I give her my order and tell her it's my daughters birthday and I'd like to order the birthday package (cake, photo, hat=$15)  yes that's right $15 for something other restaurants do for free. Anyways I order it while my daughters in the bathroom she said ok I'll go write it down right now I say thank you and we move along with our night. We had a decent dinner great band kept the kids happy it was sort of busy so we were patient with the waitress who mentioned she was new when we asked how to get the free meal for kids that's printed on the kids menu to ask the server about the free meal lol she had no idea. My daughter order a hot dog and fries it took 20 minutes to get ketchup but like I said it was busy so we were patient anyways they brought out our check brought out cotton candy I paid the bill and waited.. After 20 minutes or so after paying the bill we finally see the birthday song coming in our direction I pull out my camera to capture the special moment and it stopped a table before us hahaha jokes on us after they got done singing he waitress walked over asked if there was something else I needed I asked if they were still going to help us with my daughters birthday celebration and she started to apologize and say she completely forgot which is ok because like I've stated twice before it was busy and she is human so things happen she then asks if we still wanted it or if we just wanted the cake lol I respond I mean if it's alright with you id still like more then just the dinner for my daughters birthday thinking I had already paid for it .. By this time both my kids heads are on the table from being tired it's 9pm and they have school/daycare tomorrow so they come back 15 minutes later sing the birthday song give us the cake and take the picture our waitress says they will be right back out with the picture and again apologizes for the mix up and keeping us waiting I say it's ok ask for a box and box up the cake because my little one was being crabby as you can see in the video so it was just best we left. We're headed out and the waitress runs up and gives us a new ticket saying that she updated the price since she forgot about the birthday I'm thinking how nice of her to fix her mistake lol she updated the ticket and charged us for the horrible celebration that she forgot. Listen in the video as they stop in the middle of the song to ask her her birthday then asks how old she is . I told the lady she could get the manager because I wasn't paying for it and she responded Rudely saying \"well I guess I'll just pay for it out of my tips\" I left her $12 on the original ticket yes you should have to pay for your mistake the worst birthday dinner I've ever seen. Great establishment but horrible waitress we will not be back. Sorry for the rant but she bummed a very important day for us. Did I mention after talking with the manager he apologized for her and also mentioned we don't get a hard copy of the photo like she said we just get to download it off their website lol the strangest $15 bday package I've heard of."}
{"text":"Terrible food, steak was tasteless ribs were full of fat, only thing good was the margarita."}
{"text":"Delightfully Dissatisfied.  A tourist attraction at the very best.  Like many other Yelpers we showed up and saw that the parking lot was surprisingly full.  I drove to the front of the building to drop off my party.  A guy came to my truck and pointed to a few open spots very close to the front door and then told me he works off tips.  It was a valet your own car of sorts.   But I didnt want to park all the way down the hill so I gave the guy a few bucks after I parked my own car.  

We walk up and yes there is a live steer roaming a stall right by the front door.  Hey kids this is where your steak comes from. 

When you walk into the restaurant it is all about the wood beams and cowboy country decorations.  We were seated immediately  despite the overcrowded parking lot. 

The view was absolutely the best part of the evening.  We arrived right at sunset and the view over the valley is great.  But that's where it ends.  

The food is terrible.  I ordered a steak that was supposed to be a filet cooked to medium and it was just bad.  I've purchased better filet from the grocery store.  And then this is where it gets kind of weird.  They dont let you choose your sides.  all meals come with corn sweet potatoes and carrots.  first I dont care for those sides and even if I did the potatoes were mushy and gross and orange (sweet potatoes are orange) and I didnt touch the unappealing orange carrots  strictly from a visual point of view it was unappealing..orange potatoes, orange carrots and red steak (ordered medium got rare)  and then the taste was even worse than the look.  Its too bad because this place could be really really good but they have screwed it up and basically made it a cafeteria with a view.  I would be scared to see the kitchen because I can just imagine large vats of mushy sweet potatoes and carrots.  Everything tasted and looked as if it was prepared the day before.  It was just a shame because like I said earlier, This place could have been amazing.  

And then there is the entertainment.  When we were dining a balloon animal guy interrupted us keeping in mind we were dining with two 14 year olds.  Last time I checked 14 year olds were not into balloon animals.  and then there was the magician.  he interrupted us twice before clearing the table to make room for a card trick.  OK i will give credit where credit is due.  The card trick was pretty cool.  But not in that environment.  

Sorry Rooste I will not be coming back!

Oh and lastly it is really expensive for junk food."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is unique. I went with a large group as part of a conference but I can't even imagine going here as a regular dinner table of 4 people. The place is huge & loud. 
When we arrived we went in the door marked handicap access with my elderly mom. There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we'd entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going \"past the slide\" & we'd come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes. 
The area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside. 
The food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I've ever tasted on a separate buffet. 
One of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition. 
Would I go back on a return to Phoenix? Likely not...this is more of a one stop novelty for me."}
{"text":"It's not for classy people. It's really for cowboys. We had ribs, and grilled chicken. There was no taste. Had the worst margarita. The saloon tender just poured margarita mix from a water galon on ice in a plastic cup, added little bit tequila. No salt on the rim. As I said, it's not a place for city people. It is for cowboys. 
Stay away."}
{"text":"Fun place with a beautiful view. However, the food is gross. I ordered the NY strip, Hub ordered the burger. Son loved his kids' burger so that's good. 
I was off playing with our son, he loved the silver slide, whe our food arrived. When we returned to the table there were those little silver covers on my dinner and son's dinner. Husband was already enjoying his burger. I uncovered my steak and was about to dig in when hub said, \"There is a huge hair wrapped around your steak.\" I looked and didnt see it right away but, BAM, there it was. I wondered if it was mine but it couldn't have been. No opportunity for my hair to get there and not exactly my color. The waitress was a sweet as could be about it and brought me a replacement burger. 
The burger tasted amazing but I kept finding bone chips. Gag!!! 
Anyway, when we got the bill, the waitress had NOT taken the steak off the bill! What?? 
My husband asked to speak to the manager and the guy was like, \"You wanna come into the kitchen and look at my cooks? No long hair there!\" as if to say that we had made the whole thing up and planted a hair! Anyway, he ended up taking the darn thing off the bill but I will NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Took my momz here with the fam for the 1st time, to celebrate her 26th bday . We had a good time. Made reservations. Sat within a few minutes in a booth overlooking Phoenix city. Food was delish. Drinks delish. Loved my prickley pear margarita. Ordered the NY strip...coulda used a bit more salt, but nonetheless, delish. Hub had prime rib. Momz had the ribs. Kids ate off the kids menu. Waitress was sweet. Buss boy was so greatful my kids were so polite. Ambiance was fun and relaxing. Kids enjoyed the slide. My mom got a kick outta the birthday cake, hat, bandana, and singing. All in all, it was a great experience. Oh! And they have a lower parking down the road. The shuttle driver was awesome...quick as heck. Would go here again. Lots of leftovers too. Yeehaw!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit. Had steak ribs. This time Ribeye. Large portions. Take out is available. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Quantity but no quality!
Regret that I went there. I should have trusted the reviews and gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went last night for a friends birthday. They love this place. I for the life of me don't know why. The food is awful. Steak no flavor at all both mine and my wife's. I know its a cowboy tourist destination but hey come on this is lousy food. Sloppy service. Melissa our waitress must have had a rough night because she didn't seem to care much. I will only go back if invited but will strongly recommend another place."}
{"text":"Love the rustic cowboy western atmosphere. Okay so it's a little kitsch with the sad lonely steer out front in the mosh pit and taxidermy rattle snakes, but it's fun; especially with the indoor slide that big boys can go swim too.  Large cavernous space with plenty of room for indoor and outdoor seating.  Live country western music every evening and dancing for those so inclined.  Love the evening view of the camelback mountain and other ranges in the distance.  Can also accommodate very large groups.  I have been here with my son several times on our annual Cactus League spring training trips and haven't had a bad meal yet.  Food is reasonably priced and generous portions accompanied by all the fixings including Indian fry bread with cinnamon butter or hot biscuits with honey. A few good choices for non red meat eaters too.  I have been satisfied with the mesquite grilled marinated sword fish; tender, fresh and juicy! My son loves the wrangler bone in ribeye. Smoked on the grill and cooked perfectly.  The compliment of cooked carrots were surprisingly good as they were crispy and slightly sweet.  Cotton candy a nice touch at the end with the bill."}
{"text":"View is good, beer selection is poor.  Service was good.  I had the baby back ribs, honestly were the worst I have ever had, and I have eaten and cooked a lot of ribs.  They were way overcooked to the point the meat tasted like bone marrow, then they were drowned in bbq sauce. 
Not impressed with the food quality at all, will not be coming back when in town, at least not for the food!"}
{"text":"Three stars?  C'mon Yelp. You're misleading people. I'm a steak guy and can stomach most bad foods with little complaint but this was bad. Really bad. Worse than sizzler. At $23 for steak you are better off going to ponderosa / sizzler / etc and saving $10 per meal for better food. Another alternative is paying an extra $10 and go to Steak44 or Donovan's - you will pay more but get a fantastic meal. 

Ordered the rattlesnake and cactus fries appetizer. All fries and very little snake. NY strip was thick bland and poor quality meat. Beans were made to hold bricks and not for consumption. All Other sides were bad. I would like to make myself throw up - I feel the food polluted my body. 

This place makes its living because of proximity to Arizona Grand and nice view overlooking town. The parking lot is full, absolutely FULL of people who love bad food or tourists like me getting picked off. On the plus side the band they had playing was actually pretty good. 

My last time here. No second chance."}
{"text":"I went to RR with my 5 year old on a daddy daughter date night on Saturday.  She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.   

I ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.

Our dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.

When we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entrée and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.

Did I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.

Overall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree."}
{"text":"The feel here is always so cobwoy-eque, and I've been going to this restaurant since I was a kid. Glad not all things have changed.

I love the $15 birthday/anniversary/etc huge eclair, cowboy hat and handkerchief, and singing. The eclair is bigger than a football so be prepared.

We paid $50 for our split meal, appetizer, and eclair special including the $3 extra plate fee (which we knew about, but didn't know it literally included extra food, too = BONUS!). The Indian fry bread was delicious with the cinnamon butter and honey as always. So were the tater skins, and all the sizes of food were humongous. We made 2 meals out of our leftovers!

You never disappoint!"}
{"text":"The hostess staff and food were lackluster. I came in excited to try the place out and it was disappointing to be greeted with someone who clearly didn't want to be there. Our server was nice. I ordered the Rustler's cut. The meat was pretty flavorless, a little over cooked, and pretty dry. I had higher expectations especially since steak makes up a good portion of the menu, so you'd expect it to  be something they've perfected over time. Truly disappointing. The view was really beautiful from the outdoor area, but overall- that was the only thing that I felt good about."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to come here for his birthday. I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town.
We had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.)
We started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...)
There's sawdust on the floor, and the décor screams \"Disney Design Company.\" All the clichés of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards.
When we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing!
This is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials.
I had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the \"B\" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an éclair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle.
We went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast.
Rustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!"}
{"text":"If I can give a zero I would. They tell us to make reservations for mothers day brunch and when I got there they told me it was a 40 minute wait. Then why make reservations? We waited, the wife got hungry and had to leave. Thank you for ruining our mothers day! I will NEVER go back ever!!! Being that it's a negative comment I bet no one will respond to make things better. Sad because I really loved your establishment."}
{"text":"If you're going to go there are two MUST do's. First go down the slide it's so fun!!! Second order a Cow Pie for dessert. The view is fantastic!!! Also the I very much enjoyed the Filet! It was very tender and juicy! The atmosphere is also great they have live music, magicians, and people making balloons. The magicians they have are awesome!! I go to Rustler's Rooste a couple times a year and have had the pleasure of watching both magicians and they always leave me scratching my head wondering how they did that. Of the multiples times in my life I have been to Rustler's Rooste I have never had s bad experience it's always a great time!! If you have people visiting I would definitely take them there as well as if you are visiting Phoenix you should for sure go!"}
{"text":"Called a week ago to get reservations for Thanksgiving and was told they were not taking reservations. Just come over and wait. I called today to say can I get on the wait list I was driving over now and I am 15 minutes from you. Nope can not do that. My grandson arrived ahead of us and he said I would like to get a table for 3. Nope, the whole party must be present to get on the wait list. So he asks how long is the wait? 60-80 minutes unless you sit at a picnic table outdoors. 

I have been in the restausant business most of my life. This is no way to run a holiday meal. Nothing scares away customer more then a 1-2 hour wait. I will never come back nor ever speak of you again Mr Rooste. You are dead to me now. I am thankful for other options today."}
{"text":"This restaurant looked interesting in the travel brochures and I was really looking for a place to eat with a view. I went here for dinner with 3 other adults and I must say, there really is a nice view of the valley from the restaurant. Other than that...well. As advertised, it is a themed restaurant with a live \"country\" band.

We were seated at a table with 4 chairs and we were very crowded with a condiment holder, butter, rolls, appetizer plates and drinks. Our legs under the table were also crowded. When the sun set it got dark in the restaurant fast with just a few high lights and a candle on the table. Had to read the menu by cell phone.

The potato skin appetizer was a simple with cheese, bacon and green onion. The dish could have been served at any chain restaurant. I ordered the beef ribs with the standard \"family-style\" accompaniments (salad, carrots, corn on the cob and beans). The others with me ordered pork ribs, fried chicken and a steak and enchiladas. The beef ribs were \"fall off the bone\" to the point that they were probably boiled or steamed. One of the ribs was a little \"gamey\" tasting but the 2 others I ate were decent tasting. The BBQ sauce that was drizzled over the beef ribs wasn't meant for beef (too sweet) and was also on the pork ribs that my wife has. The 1 steak that our table did order was cooked correctly. The pork ribs were overcooked. I didn't try the fried chicken. The carrots were overcooked and unseasoned. I thought the beans had a good southwestern kick of seasoning but others at the table didn't care for them.

For the location, I would have liked to see a restaurant that is more focused on the food and diner comfort then the western theme and unique quirks (no were did not order the rattlesnake)."}
{"text":"Great value, staff, and atmosphere. Not into country music, but they play danceable music, fun for the whole family. We asked for a table by the windows to see the beautiful view of the valley and the manager made sure we got a nice table, even with a busy night.

Looks like a great place to bring the kids, and mommy was happy as well with nice margaritas, and free cotton candy! Even noticed a \"ballon man\" walking to tables with kids and making fun ballons for them..

By sure to say hello to Horney The Bull by the front door, and close your nose if you are not used to the smell! (you can't smell anything inside)

We had the \"Cowboy Stuff\" for 2 and it was a whole oven pan full with food, easily ehough for 3.."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Loved the view of the city. They have a bull outside, a slide inside and live entertainment."}
{"text":"Ladies, don't try to be cute up in this place. Its a hard climb into the front door. The entrance is made out of stone, rocks. Very slippery. I loved the Real Live 900 ton Texas Long Horn at the front door, Was a little fragrant though. The best thing i did in this place was, take the Slide to the bottom half of the restaurant., And i was in a dress too..lol. ok very cowboyeee looking, saw dust the whole thang. i had been wanting to come here for a min. My Honey took me for a romantic dinner. My steak was WELLLLLL done shoe leather. The entire meal was luke warm. Like the forgot to bring it. It wasn't cheap, I wont go again. But I stress, be care full walking in the front entrance. its at an angle and high hill shoe friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is hands down amazing. The live country music, the steer outside.. everything! We are visiting from WA and my parents told me we just had to do a date here! So we came and were blown away. My husband got the smoked chicken wings and said they were pretty good. I got the sirloin steak and I unfortunately couldn't finish it. It was not good didn't have any flavor and bloody when I got medium. The rolls crumbled to nothing when you tried to pick them up and had a strange taste. All in all I will bring my family here for the experience of it all. 

Lastly my husband and I noticed not one staff member smiled..once. Made it a little harder to enjoy our date night. Be happy!! :)"}
{"text":"Very marginal food, service, and atmosphere.  there is a live bill out front, and it really makes the whole area smell like cow flops. Disneyland atmosphere."}
{"text":"The view is nice but the food is terrible. There's not really anything else to say. Go there and see for yourself - or actually don't, because I've already warned you :)"}
{"text":"Been there twice.  Both times the service is spotty, usually because of new serving staff who do not know what they are doing and do not understand their products.  I asked for a bottle of  San Pellegrino sparkling water and received a glass of Pinot Grigio!  The waitress had no idea of what either of the beverages was.  The food is barely acceptable, too much salt in the ribs' sauce, other things overcooked.  It is a novelty restaurant, but for a seriously good meal and service, go somewhere else.  Also, the place is so dark that you cannot easily read the menu."}
{"text":"Good experience. We made reservations for a Friday night and only waited 5-10 minutes. We ordered the cowboy meal for 2 and feasted on barb q chicken, ribs, beef skewers chicken skewers, corn on the cob, fried shrimp, pineapple cole slaw, salad, biscuits and cowboy beans. While the view is probably great during the day, at night all you see are city lights. There were several families and kids were literally running around the restaurant and to the indoor slide. Not the place for a quiet, cozy romantic dinner. But definitely good food with a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I make sure that I stop here every year when I head to the Phoenix area for spring training. It is situated atop a hill with great views. The long horn bull at the front door is neat for having photos taken with. My favorite part of entering is the option to go down a slide from the reception area into the restaurant. 

The service is great, family style serving platform. It's not a formal place, more a place that you can be comfortable (being from the Midwest). They had live music which was nice. 

The food is good, service is great, a place you absolutely need to check out."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews on the Rooste and it appears to me that you either Love this place or you Hate it. 
I will give tell you of my experience as I have no dog in this fight one way or the other. I only tell it like it is. 
\"The Facts and Only the Facts.\" The names won't be change to protect the innocent or the guilty. This past weekend 
my wife and I were in town for my daughter's graduation and wanted to enjoy a celebration dinner. We had reservations at Ditka's
That review will have to wait for another day. But moving on. my daughter recommended Rustler Rooste. Saying it was a bit more kid 
friendly. She was right on the mark. Very down home country. Not stuffy and or  upscale. Family oriented from the Long Horned Bull outside, to the entry
way access, the slide/staircase, to the country band and huge dining area. Service on our visit was prompt, accommodating, and very attentive.
As we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we had this guy hopping and slinging bread and drinks that never seemed to run low. Finally we ordered. Food came out quick, 
Hot and correct. A rare occurrence normally with a large group and large order. But it was right. Everyone enjoyed their meal, conversation and drinks. The place is noisy
lots of movement, bands, a wedding party, kids on the slide. Cotton Candy flowing out of tin cans. Just a good light hearted night out with the family. 
Serving sizes were good, price was moderate. Menu had something for everyone. Family style servings too if that's your thing. I really enjoyed it. 
The Prime Rib was on point I might add. The last item if you're going for dinner. Sunset is the time to go. The view was amazing. Definitely would come back again.
But Ditkas is still on my to do list."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a fun place to go for the ambiance, it is however not a place to go if you are interested in a good steak.

The food is typical but not at a level that I would consider a normal steakhouse to be at. The meat was cooked close to correctly but lacked any real flavor. The sides seem as though they are an afterthought and lack any real imagination or flavor as well. 

Overall, I would say that this is fun place to take your kids or a friend who likes country to. It is not a restaurant that I would take anyone who is looking for an affordable and delicious meal."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Southern California and decided on the restaurant because it was on the lot where our hotel was. We were staying at the Arizona Grand. They have a shuttle that will pick you up and take you there. The food and atmosphere was great. Great place for kids. There is a slide, shuffleboard, live country music, and a dance floor. I had the BBQ pork ribs and the meat fell off the bone, they were so tender. The view was also amazing, I recommend going at sunset and making reservations."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have had good food and a great time on all occasions. Some of the best views in town and the prime rib is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dining experiences ever! I would suggest anyone traveling to Phoenix to have dinner here! As you walk in, you pass a bull hanging out in the entrance. A real bull. If you get seated downstairs, feel free to take the SLIDE. Yes a SLIDE. The food portions were HUGE. I could barely eat half my meal. Rattle snake is on the menu with a fabulous cucumber sauce. I got a 'I ate the snake' t-shirt as a souvenir. When the waiter brought the bill, he also brought a bucket of cotton candy for us! How cool. The view of Phoenix from our table was spectacular.
However, a bit of warning. Your clothes will smell of this place for a good 2 washings. Walking around the next two days, I would pass people that had eaten dinner at the Rooste the night before. It was quite obvious."}
{"text":"I went in with family from out of town.  Parking lot had small parking spaces.  Don't take full size vehicle.   Wait time was atrocious despite lots of empty tables.  Serving staff was poorly trained.  They didn't bring us any napkins, silverware, or plates with appetizers.  Appetizer weren't cooked right.  Chips were stale. Wings were over cooked.   Eventually left because we couldn't get seated at full service table.   I won't try to eat there again."}
{"text":"My friends took me out for dinner, and it was a fun, special night.  We sat at a table by a window on the second floor, and we had a fabulous view of downtown Phoenix, Camelback Mountain, and Tempe.  Our waitress was friendly, and the service was perfect -- not rushed, but also attentive.  She brought bread (biscuits and little fry breads) and salad (nothing special) right away.  I only had one biscuit, but I ate an entire little pail of the cinnamon butter with it, because it was delicious and I have no shame.

I wanted to order the \"Cowboy Stuff,\" which has a two person minimum, so my friend agreed to order it with me.  I enjoyed getting to try a lot of different foods.  The ribs were amazing.  They were served with a side of bbq sauce, which I didn't try because the flavor of the ribs were too good to bother with sauce.  We each got one shrimp, which surprised me (I expected more), but they were enormous and perfectly fried -- nice and crispy.  (I saw the same shrimp arrive batter-free in a shrimp cocktail that came to the next table -- it's really the shrimp that are huge, not a massive amount of batter.)  The fish kabobs were just lovely.  I don't like coleslaw, so I didn't try it, but props to the beautiful presentation -- it was served in a halved pineapple, with huge spears of pineapple as fresh fruit garnishes.

I was too full to eat the steak kabobs (which I had actually planned to eat first, but I was enticed by the other food and lost track), the corn on the cob, the chicken, and the beans, so I will have leftovers tomorrow for lunch, and probably dinner.  Considering the quality of the food (very, very good), I was quite pleased with the amount that we got for the price.

Also, my old fashioned was a surprising color (rather red), so I wasn't sure about it until I tasted it.  It was so good that I commented a few times during the evening.

The live music was entertaining, and the ambiance was fun and moderately loud (my friend who is hard of hearing had a bit of trouble, but not as much as at some other places we've been to).  Being at the window made it particularly special, but I would have enjoyed the evening even if we hadn't had such great seats.  I definitely look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We brought a large party in after graduation. Our waiter was fantastic; the food, not so much. They do stick large parties in the back, in kind of tight quarters which I could understand, but the rest of the place was fairly empty as we did not dine till 8:30 pm. We would have been better off in three neighboring booths.

The slide was fun, the views are fantastic. The band was great, although they stopped playing before we were done dining. Very bland steaks and the pepper container wouldn't work. For the prices of the steaks , they should have had a pepper mill. I know I am not the only one who found those steaks bland. Diner beware."}
{"text":"ok so my pops was in town and i thought he would dig the atmosphere...so yes...i went back...and to my suprise the food was actually good this time! i hate it when i can't figure out if i like a place or not.  only 3 stars now because i have had only one great experience."}
{"text":"An extra star had been added for the excellent \"over the top\" service we received from Ricky! My niece wanted to try cactus and rattlesnake. While she found the snake too breaded to taste, she enjoyed the cactus. Ricky also showed us where to find a scorpion. She REALLY didn't want to leave the state without seeing one. Thanks for everything Ricky!!"}
{"text":"Oh Rustler's Rooste.  What can I say?  Well it got 2 stars because of its location.  It sits nice and high on top of the hill and you get a fantastic sunset from up here.  You can see all of Tempe and Phoenix.  Although, you should come here with your car and look a the view and THEN LEAVE.

We went here because we heard it was a nice steakhouse and wanted to have a nice place because family was in town.  We walked in the door and it was a kid friendly place with a slide and straw thrown all over the floor and arcade games.  What a weird atmosphere.  They should replace this with something a little nicer and they could charge a fortune for the location.  If you have kids, consider going here, and then don't actually make a trip here."}
{"text":"Came here for a company Christmas Party.. The food was plentiful but my steak lacked flavor. This is my second trip here and I haven't been overly impressed. All of our food was served cold, our waiter wasn't attentive overall this wasn't a great experience for us. Better luck next year when we return."}
{"text":"What a shame - beautiful restaurant and environment - just really bad cooks. I was part of a big group and we order almost all cuts - I order swordfish - everything , including the fish , was dry !!! - disappointing. I also tried the rattle snake, don't try it, totally frozen and lacking taste. Hope they improve their cooks so I can come back , they are in a great location , fantastic view of the city."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time last night. Although it was crowded, we knew that going in.  Saturday Night during Spring Training.  Kids loved the slide. Love Country Music being played. Band members very nice and personable. Great app to coordinate your wait time to your cell phone. 
Food was good - staff was attentive and very nice.   This is our go to place when we visit the PHX area!  Thanks guys!!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The ambience is really nice, they have live music and the view of the city is great. They have an outdoor fire pit and the decor is great for their western style theme. The service is average and their food is average. I was expecting the food to be much betterr. I had the New York strip was a bit tough to eat and a bit undercooked. The corn on the cob is just  boiled nothing special and the yams were aberage.  Other than the ambience the food is very average for the price, $23.00 for my plate."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews and a lot of good reviews on here. I won't let them influence me and I'll give it to you straight. Rustler's Rooste wasn't a \"classy\" place by any means. Some people expected a top notch eating experience, and that's not what it is. 
1.) Good atmosphere- live music and southwest feel
2.) Spotty service- felt like I was being ignored a little bit
3.) Decent food- aside from the rattlesnake, the rest of the food want special. It was nice that they kept us busy with bread and salad, and even brought cotton candy out after our meal, but the streak was subpar and the vegetables were undercooked

While this place wasn't awful, it wasn't amazing either. Little kids won't know the difference and it might be a pleasant experience for you."}
{"text":"Great view, service and atmosphere. Unfortunately the food was so plain. I ordered the New York Strip medium rare and somehow they managed to burn it to a crisp on the outside. No flavor at all I was almost tempted to put A1 on my steak (). Bread and almond butter was probably the best thing they had to offer. I'd rather go to Texas Roadhouse and spend less for a better steak."}
{"text":"Kitschy.  The view is spectacular.  The smell from the bull outside as you're walking in is not.  The bull totally fits the idea - setting the scene for the old west and showing you what you're about to be eating, but the smell is far from appetizing, particularly after the \"rain.\"  I was taken off guard when the soft-spoken server mentioned the slide, and wasn't really in the mood to try it myself, but I did see some others give it a go later.

We were promptly seated by the window, where we could get a good view of the guys who were lassoing the wooden calf out front.  It was charming to be served beer in Mason jars, even though the selection of draft beers could have been larger.  The fry bread we had while waiting for the rest of our party was good, though the chewiness indicated that it wasn't that fresh, but the cinnamon butter made up for it.  I opted for the Vaquero,a smaller steak served with cheese enchiladas.  The steak was decent, but the tortillas of the cheese enchiladas were quite chewy.  I think I should have opted for the filet, which my dining companions all got, and it came with green beans and corn.

Would I go back?  Maybe if I had kids and was passing through town.  Otherwise, I'll be looking for somewhere with more focus on the food than the theme."}
{"text":"Kevin seems to have become our regular waiter and we couldn't be happier!  Rustler's Rooste is our go to restaurant for family events - birthdays, anniversaries, out of town guests... The food is great, the slide, music, waterfall and the balloon man on the weekends entertain the kids.  The staff goes way out of their way to make sure our wants and needs are met (including accommodating a severe dairy allergy).  Thanks for another great night Kevin and team!"}
{"text":"Huge, noisy place, ideal for large groups, corporate events, celebrations. Average food, ribs are best, seafood always way overcooked. Nice slide for kids to go from entry floor to ground floor! 
Great night views of Phoenix from patio for pictures."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant while on vacation this Summer!  My family had its reunion in Phoenix and this was the location of our banquet.  We had a private banquet area outside where we were able to have a fashion show, dancing etc.  Now to the meal, we had a whole half of a chicken, a whole steak, corn on the cobb, baked beans, bread and cake! And it was all delicious.  It's a shame the amount of food that was probably wasted because people were getting steak and chicken just because they could.  If I'm ever in Arizona again I will definitely be back.  There was also a live bull outside!"}
{"text":"My family and I made a trip to Arizona a few months back. It was overall a good trip I'd say. However, we went on this adventure with another family whom we are quite close with. They had previously been to the Arizona Grand and they loved every aspect of it. When nightfall rolled around on the third day, we were dragged to Rustlers Rooste, AKA Satans' shitter. The first thing we saw walking up was a cow. The last thing you wanna see before you devour a cows' intestines Is a living cow. Now to the intestines part. I ordered beef ribs and it literally tasted like they pulled out the calfs' small intestines, sautéed them in some hot cum, put them in the microwave for 9 seconds, then dropped them a couple times before serving them to me. Let's not forget how the mashed potatoes tasted like what I assume chum tastes like in SpongeBob SquarePants. I hated this place. Everyone on here is saying the atmosphere is nice and all this shit, when in reality the atmosphere is simply a few sweaty dudes playing awful music while you look at the out-of-season Christmas lights dangling above your bodily secretions. Did I say bodily secretions? Sorry I meant my Rustlers Rooste meal."}
{"text":"Super beautiful restaurant, lovely view, and environment. My hostess was a jerk rolled his eye on his way to grab me a new drink that I nicely asked for."}
{"text":"A little background information: we went on Sunday 4/17/16 @ approximately 4:30-5pm. The place wasn't that busy, so we thought for sure we'd get excellent service and great food in stellar time. 

We sat down and the waiter seemed uninterested in taking our order and being at work all together. We didn't order anything extravagant or needy, just standard menu items (nothing customized at all), the waiter cut us off as we were ordering, and acted put-off in general. The waiter then brought us our drinks, a basket of biscuits&frybread and slapped them down without saying a word and walked away. 

When our food arrived 45 minutes later, the steaks were way over cooked (example I ordered mine to be \"medium\" and it was definitely closer to well done), and NOBODY's food was hot (and NOTHING tasted good enough to justify the price I paid). The food was on the lukewarm side, but on the cool end of that spectrum. If the service couldn't get any more subpar (at least from our waiter), we had to get out of the booth to track down different servers to ask for things like butter (simple things). To top it off, the only time the waiter ever even offered to top our drinks off was when we asked for the check. 

Needless to say, I'll never be back. I will however share my experience with my friends, coworkers, and anyone else who mentions this place. It was pretty disappointing to say the least. I hope the manager or owner will read this review and make some changes. This place definitely had the potential to be a neat experience... It fell way way short. You'll get a better meal & service at just about anywhere else.i"}
{"text":"Well - where do I start!?? Last Saturday night at 6:00 PM. Wanted a table where we could hear & see the band. Up the stairs and to the back. Almost didn't know there was a band, except we saw them when we walked in!
We sat a party of 12 at a table that would seat 8 comfortably. The chairs were wobbly and VERY uncomfortable. Start to finish was 2 hours & 9 minutes long. I am still waiting on getting my glass of water refilled. The one we sat down with was the ONLY one. 
We told our waitress we were there for my friend's birthday and she asked if we bought the package. We said no, we didn't know. She said she would go & get a pamphlet. That NEVER HAPPENED! We were never offered deserts. I see some people were posting \"you get cotton candy at the end, for the table\". We saw that many times! NOT US THOUGH! 
Both my wife & I ordered the Cowboy platter. The beef was so tough that I could not chew it!  When the waitress brought our food, we had to make room for her to put down this basically cookie sheet. Our plates were literally hanging off the edge of the table. She acted like we were in her way. I was born & raised here! I have been here many times. I haven't been here in the last 15 years or so, though. WOW, sure is different. I am saddened!! Because of that night's experience, I will now expressly recommend against going to the Rustler's Roost restaurant!"}
{"text":"The view was definitely the best part of this place! The food was actually pretty good, and the service was fine.

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, and the veggies and beans were good. A bit expensive for what you get, but I guess you pay for the experience.

The negative though is that when we went outside to see the view after the meal, there were several employees outside smoking right next to us. I realize its not illegal or anything, and people smoke, but they could see that we were not liking it, and did not offer to move, or relocate to the other side where they would not be in customer view.

Sort of tacky I think, but that really is the only negative I noticed while there. Maybe next time will be better. We still definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"We had our company party here last night and had a blast!  The view is second to none and the atmosphere was great!  We were in the outdoor, covered pavilion and had a great buffet dinner of steak, bbq chhicken, beans and corn.  I would recommend this place as a true AZ experience."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is that triangle of white lights (not the take me to your leader kind) you see on the hills in Ahwatukee at night. You park at the base of the hill or at the top if you are early enough and a van will take you to the top (if you are in heels you may want to wait for that van - although stilettos are best left at home duh). In a nutshell, the place is over the top rustic cowboy; every surface is covered in wood. The food is ok - the bread (biscuits, corn bread etc,) basket is the best part. 

You wanna order the rattlesnake? Prepare to shell out $20 for it - let me save you the money. It's little scraps of chicken-like meat (the size of a nickle) deep fat fried and served with chipotle ranch. It literally tastes like dark meat chicken.

There's a live band (we were here on a weekend) playing the old classic country western (imagine that scene in Blues Brothers - Good Ole Boys style). No chicken wire cage though - bummer. 

After several drinks (which I recommend) go out on the patio and gaze at the city below. Then after more drinks, push the kids out of the way and take a ride down the slide - dare devils go head first. 

Overall - there is much to see even if the food is \"eeeh\" - even the giant beast of a bull in a pen out front, great for tourists looking for a hokey night out, or if your family is in town, take them here and explain this is how AZ is - all covered in wood, stale booze, cowboys and old timey country music."}
{"text":"Family Fun All The Way!

Was talking to a friend about this place earlier today. I still remember it from when I was 13 years old.  Right down to the souvenir boot glass that my aunt had her drink in and the metal slide.  This says one thing.  NOT A LOCAL hang but definitely a Kid friendly place that the little cowboys and girls will remember for years to come.

Let's just say I ate the snake and it tasted like oily chicken.  WAAA!!! My skin crawls just thinking about it.

Date Rating: N/A          (haven't been here since I was a kid
Pick up Scale: N/A        so I have no idea how to rate this one)

Strong Suggestions:  Just go down the slide. Don't be a wimp!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience. There were 8 of us. Everything was over cooked and under seasoned. The management was not helpful when we shared our feelings with them. We couldn't even get water refills. They had an excuse for everything tasting terrible. There are plenty of places close by to get much better steak. Don't go here."}
{"text":"My wife has never been here before so I figured it was about time.  Every Phoenician should go here at least once.  So, last Friday night as a monsoon was \"supposed\" to roll in, we decided to pay the Rooste a visit.

The parking lot at the top was full so we parked at the bottom.  I wouldn't have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe \"saloon\" doesn't do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.

The place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style. 

Our waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.

I love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.

My wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.

I know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.

Anyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people. 

Although a monsoon didn't end up rolling in which would have been nice to watch up there, we had a good time anyway."}
{"text":"Last night my family went to dinner here for my 40th birthday, it was one of the worst experiences ever.  We had 7 people, 3 adults and my 4 small children.  The first 5 minutes were great (the only reason for the 2nd star) as my kids loved the slide.  But just like the slide, it was all downhill from there.  A server brought us water, but he only brought 6 (because our party of 7 was placed at a 6 top), when I asked for another one so all the children had one, he said \"the little ones can share\". He never returned with another water.  Our waitress was overwhelmed, as it looked like she had 4 party's of 7 or more, and obviously did not feel like dealing with my children.  Once she rushed us through our order, not explaining that you got carrots and corn no matter what, she was gone.  Food came out very quickly so that is a plus.  But the food should have been given more attention.  The kids simply had Mac and cheese (can't mess up Kraft). But the 3 adults had steak.  I had a bone in ribeye that was over priced, but that isn't the issue.  It came out and was cooked to a fair MR, but the meat itself was super fatty and grissly, had no seasoning on it and was super tough.  My wife's prime rib was over cooked.  I ordered a \"bucket\" of sweet potato fries that came out burned.  I could not get anyone to get us more drinks so the small children were not happy, this make the waitstaff want to come over even less.  The only good thing was that 3 of the kids ate free with adult purchase, so my $120 wasn't as bad as it could have been.  I say save you money and head down to the casino, you have a better chance of a winning night.  Certainly won't forget my 40th, just for the wrong reasons.  :("}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL SAD THAT THE OVERALL RATING IS NOT 5 STARS! PEOPLE ARE WAY TOO ANAL! 

I loved this place! Never looked it up before I went just decided to show up and was very amazed with this American Restaurant. 

Not giving it away so you have to see it for yourself. Make sure you see what's waiting for you close to the main entrance. 

The food was more than enough and the Rattle Snake was better than I thought it would be. This place would be awesome for a small or huge party or work function as there's lots of room. The staff is all cool.


I highly recommend this place. Peace!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat hands down! Food is amazing and the atmosphere is even better! We got the potato skins to start and they were so yummy. There are people that go around as entertainment, balloon makers, magicians and the kids got free cotton candy! The steak we had was amazing! I wish I had room for dessert cuz I saw it go by and it looked to die for! Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Food over priced & mediocre, especially the rattle snake/cactus appetizer for $17.95, deep fried & mostly all cactus.  Potatoes are ala carte. Kids screaming so loud, little to no conversation possible, and about the poor bull stuck in a pen, if they are not exercising him, I hope animal rights takes notice!"}
{"text":"lets start with your parking choices. Valet up by the front door with the disabled parking or climb up the mountain from the bottom lot. Sounds bad but I was thankful for my Mom's disabled parking tag. 

I do have to give it props for atmosphere (do people give props anymore?) the view is great, the drinks were tasty (long island iced tea) and the staff mostly attractive. 

I ordered the prime rib, it has some fancy name for the size like \"ranch hand\" it was the 16 ouncer done medium well. It was done to perfection with the exception of the fact it was cold, visualize 16 oz slices of medium well prime rib sitting in a 90% oven waiting to be ordered. 

The veggies were piping hot and the baked beans were tasty. My mom later claimed that her chicken wasn't very good and my Dad liked his steak OK, but nothing to go back for. Since it was my Aunts B-Day we all just went with the flow (she thought she was paying). BBQ? There wasn't a smokey flavor to anything other than the beans, my Dad's steak didn't have any \"BBQ\" flavor. 

There was a \"good\" (is there good country music?) by good I mean talented, live country band that allowed a few very good guests to sing, while people scooted their boots, young and old. This was fun to watch. 

For the price, I would expect much better food. But if you go, go to have a good time, around folks also having a good time and don't expect the best food ever. P.S. don't be a wuss, and take the slide down to the dining area."}
{"text":"This will be my shortest review, i swear. 

The place itself is fun, with a Disney-like vibe, live band, slide, cotton candy and great view. 

The food is pretty much the bottom of the barrel. I tend to judge a bbq place on the fries and the fries here were really just TERRIBLE. No salt, no taste, no nothing, which goes for the rest of the food as well. 

Go for the the Bull outside and maybe a square dance. Leave immediatly without spending all your money on crap."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing view. Ok food served in a southern way, and the staff wear cowboy hats. Sometimes there's country music. But there's also terrible service, an unfriendly hostess, and they have a bull caged outside as a form of entertainment. Poor bull... Hardly even moves in there. We accidentally left something that was very important to our daughter behind and the staff did nothing, could not bother themselves to help us. It was gone and no one cared to check where we might be able to find it. Too bad, this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this steakhouse. Both the food and service were terrible. I ordered the round up appetizer which came out cold and with the side of ranch spilled all over the entire tray. My fiance ordered the trail boss porterhouse steak. His meal was ice cold including the sides. The manager came over to our table to see how things were going and barely let us share our experience with him. He told us the steak would be a little cold and walked away as my fiance and I were trying to tell him that the sides were cold too. We ended up sending both our meals back. The waitress  brought the bill and I told her we wouldn't be paying for that food. The manager came back and tried to tell us that we were responsible for the bill because the food never made it back to the chef. I explained to him that we gave both meals back and that it wasn't our problem that the waitress didn't give them to the chef. The manager said \"ok whatever\" and walked off again.  Very unprofessional. 

We will never go back to this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  It's fun, has a great view, and has good food.  It's family friendly.  If your expecting fine dining, it's not for you.  A great country feel with good BBQ and big portions here.  We've been here a handful of times and always have good service.  The rolls and fry bread with cinnamon butter are yum.  The family style salad is basic but good.  The all you can eat ribs are really good.  I haven't had anything I didn't like yet.  It's fun for special events and groups. Come for the atmosphere and a relaxed country meal and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just left Rustler's Roost, chose it for my birthday dinner I should have just gone to Texas Road House! The food is better, cheaper and the service is 100% better. The view was nice but not worth the time we spent driving there. We had a young snotty waitress that completely ruined the experience for me and the food was subpar! Much better choices out there for sure. Put a damper in my birthday but over it and looking forward to the rest of my night."}
{"text":"We really do love this place.  However depending on how busy the place is, your experience can vary.  Sometimes the staff just goes through the motions and they try to rush you.

Also kids eat free through labor day!"}
{"text":"Friday night we joined up with friends for a birthday dinner. Three of my friends ordered the fried chicken. My partner ordered a burger and myself the all you can eat ribs. My three friends who had the fried chicken ended up really sick a few hours after dinner with food poisoning and are still recovering. My partner also got sick from the food the next day. My ribs had no meat. It was like they dipped the bones with BBQ sauce and cooked them. It was so disappointing. We paid way to much money for bad food. No one deserves to get as sick as three of my friends did."}
{"text":"This place was great - many years ago.  Sadly, it's a shadow of its former self. Sure, the place still has terrific views but that's it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren't cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.  

My wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it's made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.  

Then came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be \"Overcooked and Flavorless\" because the trend started with our son's unfortunate kid's meal was consistent across the entire meal.  

My son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn't even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We'll wait, thanks.  

Getting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, \"I already told her I'd replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?\"   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.  So sorry to be an interruption to your evening of overcooking and underseasoning everything.  

We won't be back again.  Ever."}
{"text":"A place that attracts out of town visitors and large groups celebrating birthdays or whatever. Food is overpriced  for the quality. Dryed out biscuits, boring house salad, served family style, overcooked, frozen corn on the cob. My prime rib was good, should have been 1/2 the price of what I paid ! Beer list ? Ha-ha. No.
Nice view of the  city at night. That's it.
Once was enough for me."}
{"text":"This place has gone down, not longer the place for great cowboy steaks! Dined here Memorial Day evening, the staff here needs customer service skills. We were seated ordered our drinks and appetizers. The shrimp cocktail was warm, not fresh looking. When our steaks arrived mine was rare, my husbands was disappointing for a T bone , sister in laws steak was also rare. Needless to say 2 were sent back to be cooked longer, well mine came back over cooked and grey looking, the other wasn't even cooked longer. 
Besides the kids running around screaming from the next table! Only good thing was the drink and sweet potato fries. Won't be returning here anytime soon for a great cowboy steak!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came early, so had to sit in saloon . Can't complain about bartender boy, he was respectful , got orders of my rattle snack with fried cactus. I went for swank to check out all place and outside. Yes, this place is super huge!!!!! Great for large parties, of course if you can afford. Quite expensive ."}
{"text":"I think the ribs here are sooooo good

Make reservations, because it gets busy.
Ask for a table by the window, because the view is great

This is a definite place to take out of towners"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful work dinner event there tonight! Could not have picked a better place to have it. Staff was wonderful, very accommodating and attentive. Food was delicious and to top it off we did Smores by a campfire!! Calf roping was a huge hit, along with old time vintage photos. Great place for large groups. View of Phoenix sunset and lights is breathtaking!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Arizona, Rustlers Rooste is a must. Always happens on my birthday. Not going to lie, I feel like the past few times, my Ribeye has been hit or miss. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside and bland.
But always a great time nonetheless.
This place gets CROWDED. This place gets LOUD.
I enjoy it still and love spending my birthday here."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all! We found the service to be prompt and courteous, the views to be beautiful, and the food to be tasty! Bonus: live band and square dancing! While I didn't partake in the dancing, I enjoyed watching for a bit. Also, the views of the city are breathtaking. I recommend asking for a window table if one is available. 

I'm taking off one star because they keep a bull right next to the entrance. The bull himself is majestic and beautiful and surprisingly tame and well-behaved. However, the inevitable smell of manure poop is a bit of a mood killer as you're walking in and then as you're leaving the restaurant.  I think retiring the bull to an animal sanctuary would be the best move here."}
{"text":"Such a fun time. We had a large group of 8 and our service was fantastic. Our server jake was so kind and fast, and even handled every special request and was very quick and efficient!!! Will refer to our other out of town friends for a visit!!! Yum!!! Loved the cotton candy as well"}
{"text":"Perks: fun atmosphere and great views. Cute slide from second floor that kids and adults alike were smiling as they went down. Probably one of the best views of the Valley and big outdoor patio that is great for photos.

Cons: the food. Ugh. My burger was overcooked and the bun was hard. The fries were barely warm. My husband wanted a steak for his birthday which he described \"was okay once he reached the middle.\" Vegetarian friend was served Mac and cheese with meat in it but server was very apologetic. Other friend said her beef ribs were pretty good, but, all in all, very overpriced for the quality of food. All that saves this place is the ambiance which, for some people, is enough. 

I personally, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I really like the Rooste. I have been here a couple of times and it is a lot of fun with a group, or just with a friend. Don't forget to take the slide instead of the stairs, it is well worth it and makes the night start of right. You can't help but enjoy your food after you go down a 15 foot slide on the way to your table. The hamburger is amazing and my bro had the fried chicken, which he enjoyed. The view is killer and it is worth the trip if you like honkey-tonk and ranch style scenery. If you are into Texas, love America, and love country style settings, this is the place for you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a popular western themed restaurant serving mounds of fried food, pineapples filled with coleslaw, fries older than time, decibel blowout,  too loud for conversation, but beautiful views....the platter meal is 21.95 per person and we decided to pass on it as it was dark fried food....My $14.95 burger consisted of salad, drenched in dressing and croutons, fries were so wrinkled and cold, they were inedible.  The waiter will charge you if you want a substitute food!!!   The burger meat was dry and underwhelming for that price!   Others at the table ordered fried chicken, white meat, for $16.95.  The chicken breast was massive,  dry and rubbery.  Included were mushy vegetables, that were unrecognizable. 

The place seems worn out and dirty.  A western band took up the rest of the sound in an already chaotic place.  The restrooms were small for such a gigantic place, two seats and the air was hot for some reason...parking down a hill, not OK!

Please don't waste your money as it was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"The Rustler's Rooste was recommended by the concierge at our resort. I like anything western or the western atmosphere restaurants, so we decided to go check it out. From the moment we walked in through the entrance door it was like going on a Disney ride. Even though the place was packed the hostess sat us right away by a window with a view. The hostess took us to our table, on the way there you can either go the the stairs or go down the slide, of course my 30 year old daughter and I chose the slide while my husband took the stairs and took pictures of us having good old time and laughing hard as we slid down.  After we sat down the waiter greeted us and took our drink order, a minute later someone brought us a big bowl of salad, basket of biscuits and fried bread to share. I ordered the pork chops, every bite I took I was in Ecstasy!  My hubby and daughter ordered the Filets and they enjoyed it too. My hubby said he can cut it with a fork it was so tender. After dinner they bring you a bucket with cotton candy in it to share. Did I mention they have a country band playing while you're enjoying your dinner and looking at the beautiful view! We had an awesome time and if we travel to Phoenix again you bet your a$$ we'll be going there again."}
{"text":"View is fantastic. The atmosphere is fun. The service could be better, but it would be hard for the food to be any worse.

Seriously you'll get better food at Carl's jr. but you'll pay Steakhouse prices."}
{"text":"A cowboy place for sure!  The atmosphere is pretty cool with the western theme. We got a seat pretty quick and our server, Amy brought drinks real quick.  We split the bone in ribeye. They charged us $3 to do it but we got a whole complete set of sides which for $3 bucks is great. Corn on the cob, carrots and cowboy baked beans. The meal also includes a salad and bread. Lots of food!  The view and the ambience is enough to stop in but the food is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We went with out of town guests and had a fabulous time. The service was excellent. They have some interesting/fun menu items like the rattlesnake appetizer as well as traditional items. They give kids free cotton candy after dinner. The adults shared one order of chocolate cake that was huge!! The views are amazing! It's a very fun place to visit because it's not only food but an experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had to wait 80 minutes for a table on a busy Sunday night as I didn't think to make reservations.  Glad I waited as enjoyed our dinner.  Kids menu is small but they found what they wanted and liked it.  I had a combo plate with filet medallions and shrimp and it was very good.  The medallions were cooked how I asked and the shrimp were HUGE.  The music was fun, a balloon guy for the kids, etc.  I'd recommend calling ahead and or making reservations to cut down on your wait.  It's a touristy place but I was a tourist so enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"overall the meal was good. however our party was starving.  cool vibe and history. dont know about smelling steer animal smell before walking in but hey i get it.  steaks we cooked on point. 2 of the party had some daily special that was stuffed with blue cheese and some other kitchen creation.  they both said it was ok.  Me on the other hand i like to let meat speak for itself.   The bad is the bathrooms. Think bus station in Deming that is probably cleaner.  Floor seemed like uneven in alot of the restaurant so elderly stay away.  Draft beer was terrible...of all the good breweries that are local in phx you would think of a tourist place would get at least 2 rotating taps.  just my 2 cents. Shiner Bock original was the best beer on tap if that tells you anything"}
{"text":"We were a walk in on a Friday night and were seated within a half hour. The slide was fun for the kids. The service was decent, our server was nice but super rushed because he was slammed with several big tables. There was also a wedding reception going on on the deck. The food was pretty lackluster for me. I had the fried chicken and it was really really bland. Which was very disappointing considering the price. Everyone else in my party said their food was ok, but nothing to spectacular. Maybe an off night with the wedding reception going on. May try again someday."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience food was great live country band customer service was great.  Had the ultimate Margarita hands down it was great.  View was beautiful will definitely recommend it.  Great for friends or a date night."}
{"text":"Out of the restaurants that I have been to, the decoration of this restaurant was splendid. Rustler's Rooste was complete with an indoor slide, indoor wall-fountain, performers, amazing city views, a photo-booth, silly cutouts that you can put your face through, and an overall western vibe. Coming into this place, I had great expectations for the food. Sadly, the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the steak, which came with beans and corn. It was alright, but tasted like any other meal. The steak was a bit too chewy, the corn was... well, corn, and the beans were just 'okay'. Something was amiss. Also, it was difficult to have a conversation because it was quite loud. I'm not sure if this was because of the location of the table.  The restaurant didn't have a sit-and-dine kind of atmosphere, but rather a louder, rowdy wild wild west kind of atmosphere (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending). 

Bottom line:
-I would recommend checking out this restaurant if you want a new experience and a fun atmosphere, especially if you're new to Phoenix or Arizona. Also, this place would be good for parents with kids to visit.
-I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're searching for restaurants with exquisite or scrumptious foods."}
{"text":"bad all around bad from the bus boy who had baked beans all over his shirt to the horrible meal.  i went to this restaurant about 8 years ago and it was ok.  i won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in my steak from here. I got the prime rib and it was not what you would expect from a steakhouse. The bread was good. The salad was good. So they give you a lot of food, but my steak was sub-par and the sides (carrots and corn) that came with it were nothing exceptional. The rattlesnake was a very small portion with more cactus fries than rattlesnake. I was disappointed from the last time we stopped here because we thought it was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good, good pricing on food, server was good also. Cons were that it was freezing so definitely take a sweater(workers did turn off fans around us after we asked, but it was still very cold). We went at 9pm(they close at 10) it was ssoo dark at our table that we had to use our phone flash lights to see the menu and even stuff on the table. I don't recommend going at the end of the night cause you'll get looks from workers as if they want you to leave (felt a little rushed and awkward). AND I actually recommended going there and took family tonight with kids and mentioned the cotton candy we can get at the end so the kids were excited about it, to come to find out that they turned off the machine so we couldn't get any. Which I would think if you see we have 3 kids with us you could make at least some for them before closing. But I guess it was just bad timing. recommended but not 1- 1 1/2 hrs before closing."}
{"text":"I like this place...Saw dust on the ground, country music in the back, great views, and a small slide to get you into the restaurant. I went last night with my son. A balloon guy and magician approached our table and made waiting for our food fun. I might normally have been annoyed because I had to tip but, because I had my son I was truly grateful. Free cotton candy with dessert! And quite possibly the best chocolate cake anywhere. Yes, I just said that! It's true!"}
{"text":"This is a fun 3.5 Star family spot to have an enjoyable dinner. The view is spectacular and the live music is usually good. 

The food is pretty good, but not up to the ambiance or service. Nevertheless, this is an inexpensive meal (sub $30 for dinner), great for kids and also large groups. The steer in the front isn't shy and has no problem posing for pictures. There's rattlesnake on the menu as an appetizer.

We have been going here  with each Phoenix visit for many years and we always have a great time."}
{"text":"Ok...you're either gonna love it or leave it. Nice view, however, the smell of poop from the cattle on site as you enter is *not* very appetizing. The service was *very* attentive and I've got mad props for any server that can refill my martini in under 60 seconds!!! Bad news is that a place that is known for steak...should NOT serve one over cooked and under seasoned. (RNSG in my eyes) Still a fun environment and a good place to take out of towners that don't know the difference between Meh vs OK."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant you would see on \"The Profit\" or \"Bar Rescue\" please save yourself the anguish. We had a party from a business meeting. The server made it a point to tell us, \"I have 50 other checks so no problem\" when he assumed my check was split, very rude to start the night. When my colleague, his wife and children didn't even get their order taken let alone there food arrived at the END of EVERYONE eating including myself after the rattlesnake they brought our was cold & the Chipotle sauce they initially forgot to bring out with the plate looks like it was sitting all day, DISGUSTING! After talking with \"Tom\" a so called manager of the restaurant, after his egotistical conversation with me I couldn't even finish telling him what happened and he went off to replace my food and still others didn't even have their dinner over 1 hour being in the restaurant. They ended up cancelling their dinner after being irritated and loss of appetite from the unprofessional & down right rude service from the server and now the manager. His excuse to me was \"I wasn't there to see it so I can't say what happened\" EXCUSE ME? So you won't take responsibility for your employees actions, not even an apology or offer to rush their food or compliment them with something? His ending conversation as the food was coming out over an hour late that we cancelled was, \" No problem, we will take the food and eat it in the back no problem\" My colleague ended up taking his family somewhere else to eat after the group finished eating. Tom, please get off your high horse, learn how to listen to your customers who have built businesses beyond your recognition and take constructive criticism because your business will fail with that attitude. I feel bad the owner doesn't know how his business is being run. Please get it together for the sake of your business."}
{"text":"While most restaurants are closed Christmas Day, Rustler's Roost keeps on roostin' with an attractive fixed menu featuring several notable dishes. Be sure to call ahead for reservations and make sure to confirm the morning of (they mixed up our time with our party size).

We arrived about 20 minutes before our 7pm reservation and hung out on the upper level near the bar. From there, you can look down at the stage, dance floor and tons of families eating with kids having fun taking turns going down the slide adjacent to the stairs. Even some young-at-heart adults were using it. Once seated, we admired our fairly scenic view from atop the Arizona Grand.

The menu that night displayed several sizes of prime rib, a New York steak, several seafood options and a turkey dinner. Three of us opted for the New York steak and my future mother-in-law had the turkey. I enjoyed the flavor of the medium rare cut, albeit chewier than I like. A dab of A1 sauce was a nice complement, or even the sauce from the Cowboy beans given to us to share. The turkey plate was the most attractive of all incorporating your usual Thanksgiving fare.

Though I'm used to a Christmas dinner hosted at home, Rustler's Roost was a highly suitable alternative that could become a family tradition."}
{"text":"The grand kids were in town from Seattle and wanted to go to a \"real cowboy steakhouse\" so I made reservations at Rustlers Rooste.  We got our table for nine people right away, despite it being Saturday night.  The place was pretty crowded and noisy but that is the kind of place it is with a country western band and lots of kids.  Our group consisted of four adults and five kids ranging in age from 6 to 11 and they had a ball on the slide next to the entry staircase and chasing around outside on the patio.  The view of Phoenix at night from the patio is really nice.  They have a kids menu and our bunch had a variety of food with no complaints.  Same with the adults who mostly ordered steaks.  The steaks were done to order and for the price were very good.  The family style salad and bread baskets worked out just fine for our rowdy group.  Our server was quite busy but made sure we had refills on drinks and anything else we requested.  Rustler's Rooste is a great place to take out of town guests with kids for a fun time.  Very kid friendly.  Just don't expect to have a nice quiet dinner and also don't expect a \"Morton's\" grade of steak at Rustler's Rooste prices."}
{"text":"I will NEVER come back here! Amber, the server, was rude and disrespectful from the moment we sat down. I could receive better customer service from a drive thru window. Our order got messed up and rather than finding a solution, she continued to spit out excuses. We received dirty dishes and never got drink refills. If I had not been sitting next to a water container, we would have been thirsty all night. She gave dirty looks after we approached the manager regarding our issues. As we were leaving, she starred our party down while walking out. The food was not the greatest. I would have enjoyed it more if I at least received satisfactory customer service.Don't bother coming. The food was not the best and the waitress and staff are terrible. They forgot out order, didn't once refill out drinks we did it our selves. Not to mention most items are 15.00 or more a plate for garbage food."}
{"text":"1st this is a true review as I just got done eating at Rustlers Roost for the 1st time.  We waited at hostess stand & a total stranger said \"the service is always bad but we over look it because the food & atmosphere are good\"   We ended up sitting at the table next to this persons party. I watched as a huge roach crawled down a guys shirt & the whole table freaked out as they saw this too.  I'm scarred for life after seeing this.   It is a pretty view of the valley but that & the uniqueness of the place are the only two things I liked.  Food was ok & service very slow."}
{"text":"Unfortunately have to give 2 stars. Third time going on Christmas Eve for our family dinner and the food was terrible! They sat us next to the window with beautiful views and we had a very nice waitress; however, there were 8 of us total and every one of our meals (burgers and steak dinner) were cold!!!!! Looking back at the reviews, we aren't the only ones complaining about food being served cold! Then the manager came up and asked to replace our meals, after we've waited for our original order. Really?! So he decides to give us complimentary dessert which was a GIANT slice of chocolate cake- ridiculous! They served us bread that could feed an army, which was hardly touched. So wasteful! The food was overpriced and terrible! None of which was discounted or taken off the bill. Highly disappointed.

Best part, views....and my nephew loved the slide and photo booth ;)

Unfortunately we will not return."}
{"text":"I head down here from time to time because it's a Phoenix landmark and the things they do right, are good. 

Sometimes they're just too damn busy.   The place is huge and when a huge place is busy it's just chaos, no fun and bad service.   

When it's less busy,  they have a good menu and a good kitchen,  the ingredients and portions are all very thoughtful and high quality.     

So they fall into that weird \"valley\" of being too big and successful to be genuinely rustic and charming,  but charming and rustic enough to become big and successful.     The menu survived that but the charm is fading - eh,  it's still tasty food."}
{"text":"How disappointing it was to return here with a friend and receive such poor service not to mention the bland food. Steaks were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Rustler's Rooste I have a foot stomping good time. The best time to get to the restaurant is right before sunset. Luckily the last couple of times I've been there I had a window seat. I love going on Fridays because it's a great way to wind down from the work week. 

I brought my college aged sons last time for their first rodeo at Rustlers (just moved here last summer). They had a blast. They didn't seem to be too impressed with Horny The Bull but did enjoy sliding down the slide to get to the dining room. I did enjoy the $4 mason jars of Shiner Bock. We also were wowed by the magician's sleight of hand. On top of that there is also a live band playing; As you are free to two step the night away.

Now on to the main course, my boys ordered the All You Can Eat Beef Ribs for $16.99. And it did not disappoint, a heaping plateful of man food was served. They throughly enjoyed the ribs. I had a taste and I will order the ribs next time. The ribs were so full and meaty that they never ordered a second plate. My Sirlion Steak was cooked to perfection. A tip for you sweet potato lovers out there is to work in the pumpkin butter into the potatoes, YUM (Pumpkin Butter is served with the rolls).

Rustler's Rooste is noisy and busy. So don't be fashionably late and get there early enough to get a good seat. Also spend a couple of bucks on the valet at the top of the hill instead of waiting for the van to pick you up at the bottom of the hill. Remember to go outside and take in the panoramic views of the city, bring your camera. Prices are comparable to any area steak house. But you'll have a lot more fun in the process."}
{"text":"Well as a long time AZ Native I have visited here several times and typically leave it to the tourists and those from out of town to enjoy.  Have not been in for a long time and enjoyed my most recent visit with my fiance who is from Chicago.  It was her birthday and this was her choice while we stayed at the Arizona Grand.  As always the food is amazing and the Cowboy way combo was perfect for us. So much food we could not come close to finishing it.

Reservations are a must, made ours a week in advance and we were seated right along the window with a great view of the valley.

Romantic, fun and delicious if I were to sum it up, a must place to go if you have not been."}
{"text":"great view. great food. rattlesnake was good. I wish it wasn't raining the day i went. It would have been great to sit out on their patio to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. I came to Chandler, AZ for work and asked a local where I should go to check out a gem in Chandler. It did not disappoint.
 First, the meals are huge. They come with a family style salad and sides. We also decided to get the potato skins. That wasn't the best idea because I also ordered a NY Steak and it came with corn and additional sides and I was completely overwhelmed and stuffed.
Second, the scenery is unbelievable. The restaurant is literally built into a rock on top of a giant hill and overlooks the whole city. Incredible.
Third, get a margarita. They are delicious and strong.
Fourth, they give you cotton candy at the end. HUGE WINNER
Fifth, live country music. AM I IN HEAVEN?

The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that when you walk in and leave you are greeted by a bull pen. There is a poor cow there giving you eyes of judgement and I felt guilty after the steak."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back here in a long time, but decided to visit for my birthday. Wanted to go somewhere different. I love Rustler's Rooste because it is a really unique place with a beautiful view of the valley. The staff was really nice, server was very attentive. Love that Fry Bread. The only knock against them is that I had to salt and pepper the steak because it was lacking, but the beef was real good."}
{"text":"Horrible. Looks like a barn. Smells like a barn. Parking was perfect but it smells like Mainure as soon as you walk up. Slide going into the main dining area was cute but the smell was overwhelming while I was eating. Thank God they had 1942 Don Julio or else I would of walked out"}
{"text":"Nice big place. I did the slide going down stairs. Awesome! We had a nice table by the window to watch the sun set. Beautiful!  There was a magician that walked table to table to preform which was very cool. Loved the fry bread and cinnamon butter. We split the big Trail boss steak for dinner it was great with the chessy jalapeño bacon macaroni.  Then finished it off with the 9 layer chocolate cake. When the cake came out our great Waitor Kyle helped my fiancé purpose by putting an engagement ring on a plate under the serving dome. What a great surprise! ! Good food, good atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"Tried having dinner there on Friday, August 16,2013. Just tried because when we checked in were told 30-35 minute wait. Ok with that even though it means standing in entrance hallway. 30 minutes later checked with hostess, she tilde 3 people in front of me. Then seated at least 5 tables. Checked in again, she told me I was next to be seated then seated 3 more tables. By now over an hour has passed, it is after 8pm. This time hostess gives me the line that she asked her manager 10 minutes ago to find us a table. Only 3 in our party, could see empty tables by the window the entire hour + we were there. Left hungry & not happy. Be prepared for a long wait....."}
{"text":"I eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed my meal. This place grills a good steak, the bread that comes with you meal is really tasty and different. A must try is the rattlesnake..tastes like chicken.The atmosphere is fun and maybe a little overboard but in a good way. The magician here on the weekends is great so be sure to have him stop by your table his name is Flash."}
{"text":"The food and view are worth the price. I came here not knowing what I was in for. It's is a unique place, I would bet you have never seen anything like it. The house band was great as well as the waitstaff."}
{"text":"We were in town for work and thought, what the hey.  We hit it towards the end of the evening so it wasn't too busy.  We were sat immediately and once the waitress discovered she had a new table, the service was great.

Steak was flavorless despite being cooked perfectly... I would like to introduce you to a couple of modern inventions:  Salt & Pepper.  

The salad was sauced perfectly with ranch dressing. Not overpowering.  The live band was awesome.  We were worried that it would be too loud but it was quiet enough we could have a conversation without screaming at each other.

A fun touristy place that I will probably never revisit."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our mothers out the night before Mother's Day, just to change things up. Unfortunately we chose Rustler's Roost. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. The place was littered with loud, obnoxious children, most of whom appeared dirty and sticky, I would suggest no adult use the indoor slide to get to his/her table! The restaurant does have an awesome view of the valley and my husband planned our reservation to take advantage of sunset.  My hamburger was good as were the ribs my mom ordered. However, my husbands filet was not cooked properly and cold when it came out, his mother's filet was over cooked and tasteless. Our salad was old, wilted and soupy. The bread basket was good as were the other sides.  The service was slow and we sat without refills on any drinks for excessive periods of time. The place was too busy and without proper staffing.  We will not be returning even for the amazing views."}
{"text":"Mostly a tourist attraction. Food is mediocre at best, and was served lukewarm. Bland flavor overall. If you are local, go once if you have kids or are showing off the vista of the valley to people visiting from out of town. Otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to come once. The view makes up for mediocre food. Kids will love the place, from the Texas longhorn out front to entering and walking into a cave like entrance. The place has a rustic feel and you can literally slide down to your table. A crusty character walks around to entertain you at your table. Too bad the music is really too loud to hear. Your food choices are vast as well as the sides. Be sure to start with the rattlesnake appetizer served with cucumber dip. The side dishes tasted canned not so good. Steaks didn't come as ordered- rare means not cooked to brown.  We went early and the wait staff was attentive.  the grand kids ( 10 and 2) had a fantastic time dancing to the live ( read loud) band.  Once was enough."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential AZ tourist spot. It has a great view of downtown. It's rustic and totally cowboyed out. There is a slide for the kids, a band for the adults, a ballon twister and cotton candy. We had a large party and I ordered the fried chicken. DRY. I also had the rattle snake and for the price, skip it. It tastes like little chicken nuggets and the portion is small. They have a bull outside, I feel sorry for it. The service is good, not too loud, not too silent. Casual dress is fine here. Try to park up at the top of the hill."}
{"text":"We have family coming in town to visit from Canada, so I thought we can take them somewhere with a bit character. It turned out was very disappointing and very embarrassing for me. 
First of all, the two stars are all for the food. The food was good and brought out in a timely manor. Now, maybe because I worked as a waitress for 5 years so I kinda have high expectations on service? But the service we've received, Not worth the three stars.
We are a party of 8, so it is mandatory to be charged at least 18% tips. Which is fine, and we expected that. But the service was not worth I would say even 10%! 
The waitress did not greet us or acknowledge us until maybe 15 minutes after we sat down, asked us if we need anything other drinks besides water, then nowhere to be found afterwards. I have to hunt down our waitress and tell her we need to place our order. During the time when we were waiting for our food, most of our water are empty. Our waitress at this point, were standing literally 5 feet away from us, just standing there, not doing anything. So if she can just stood there and not doing anything, why can't she come over And check on our drinks? I don't know. I waited for a good couple minutes until I literally have to wave at her and ask her for water. And THAT was the ONLY time we got our water top up in our cup during the whole time we were dining there. 
She checked on us ONCE after the food came and asked how it taste and THAT IS IT until she bring us the check. I mean, does that mean if you know you're getting the 18% mandatory, then you don't need to provide any service? There's more to this dining experience that we were upset about the service, and I am planning to call them tomorrow to speak with the manager since I didn't get a chance to do so because I had visitors with us and I don't want to make the situation awkward. I would not go back there again, even though food was good, but it wasn't something that I can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cold beer and appetizers this is the place. Plenty of ambiance in this old west facsimile, but stop there.
Ok, maybe impress your  out of town friends with the rattlesnake, but dont go any further.
Our meal was atrocious!
The \"family\" style salad provided us each a generous single leaf of lettuce and an entire cherry tomatoe...no refills!
The bread basket boasted of Indian fry bread on the menu, this however looked more like a turd of some sort, and tasteless to boot, (sorry about the pun).
When I ordered up my bone in ribeye, I asked for it Pittsburgh style, the server had never heard the term. (And she wasnt new in the job)
I had visions of a thick cut (it did say 20 oz.) of well done prime rib steak. 
What I got was a tepid piece of meat that was at least 8 inches in diameter and only about 3/4 inch thick, full of fat and, due to it being served almost lukewarm, the fat was beginning to solidify.
In their defense, the green beans were tasty, but I had to wait for our party of 7 to finish eating before making my rounds, inquiring, \"Are you going to eat your beans?\"
Yes, I managed to make a meal out of the green beans, since that was the only good thing on the menu.
When we left, I noticed 3 tour buses in the parking lot with what appeared to be out-of-towners lining up at the entrance. 
I can only deduce that this place is still in business because of its promise of old-west lore and the charm that goes with the scenery and view.
I will never repeat this horrid experience.
Oh, I did give it one star due to our extremely pleasant young server who was all too anxious to please...but God help her, even she couldnt fix this mess!"}
{"text":"I agree with Josh W and Yvonne D. Our food came out lukewarm at best. Our kick ass waitress and the fact that you can't give a 0 star OR a negative star rating are the ONLY reasons RR is getting one star! I have to admit that the manager did offer to replace our \"cold cuts\", cold corn, and cold sweet potato mix with warm food items like we had ordered...but who wants to wait for another set of 8 properly cooked dishes when we already OVERWAITED for them in the first place????? RR, I honestly don't know how you stay in business? Your saving graces are the views and the attentive wait staff. In my opinion, Mr. Manager gets a 0 or - star rating for his poor \"resolution\" - he acted like he didn't care that a party of 8 are spending $167 plus tip on a less than mediocre Christmas meal. RR, get yo shit together!"}
{"text":"We reviewed the restaurants, thru Yelp, in the area and my son decided he wanted to try rattlesnake so that's how we ended up trying this place. I was a little disappointed when I realized the restaurant was at a resort because sometimes it's hit or miss with service. We did call ahead seating which is a great idea and recommended. We had to wait maybe 20 minutes once we showed up but that was fine because there was lots to see around the restaurant. You could kind of smell Horny, the cow, from outside but it wasn't too bad. The bartenders were very nice and friendly. Once we made our way to the table we were pleasantly surprised with a great views of the city. Our server came almost immediately and throughout the entire meal he was attentive. The four of us ordered steaks and they were absolutely beyond delicious including the sides. I could have just eaten the bread alone with the honey butter. The vegetables were at the right temperature and the beans melted in your mouth. We took the nine layer chocolate cake home. Frosting was creamy and perfect with coffee next morning. I highly recommend this place when you have guests from out of town or when you just want a great steak. Right on Rustlers Rooste. By the way try the rattlesnake it tastes like chicken... It really does and the side sauce is very tasty."}
{"text":"We are a family of 5.  Triplet Boys that are 9 yrs old.  Staying at the AZ Grand, we decided to have dinner here.  Pleasantly surprised.  Kids loved the slide and the games.  Band was fun.  Food was good.  Entrees are large and can easily be shared.  Kids automatically get a cotton candy for dessert.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun!  There is a big slide going from the second floor to the first floor that we couldn't pass up trying!  The atmosphere was fun and friendly.  It is definitely not a place for vegetarians..which is fine by me!  I tried swordfish for the first time and it was really good.  The bread they served was very tasty and it came with flavored butter!  They also have a really great selection of beers.  The view out of their big windows was also very beautiful."}
{"text":"Lively place to bring large groups of people.  We came with a group of 20-30 employees and customers, and everyone seemed to enjoy the atmosphere.  The music was a nice touch (although a bit slow), and the food and steaks were ok.  There was HUGE table that was filled by the time we left with 100 or so people - it looks like accommodating large groups is their specialty."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while we were visiting Tempe.  The following review is based on the group meal we had in which I brought my 1yr old daughter.

-First of all, not matter what the reviews say, this restaurant is best for large groups or family gatherings.  It is quite loud and I would find it difficult to have an intimate dinner.  However, it is perfect for family and kids and should warrant a visit if you are vacationing with family/friends.  

-For the kids they have a live steer as you are walking in (just warrants a quick look), a slide (kids absolutely love it) and some old fashioned video games.  

-For the adults there is a dance floor with live country music, and REALLY GOOD FOOD!  Everyone in our party loved their food, even the vegetarian (I know how cruel can we be to bring a vegetarian to a BBQ joint).  I shared one of those GIGANTIC meals for 2 or more with a friend, and each item (ribs, chicken, shrimp, etc) was somehow falling off the bone with amazing flavor.

-The only compliant I had was the service was a little off the longer we stayed.  When we first got there the service was amazing, someone stopped by our table every 5-10 minutes.  But after a couple hours of eating and drinking the server couldn't be found.

-Overall, if you are visting the Tempe area for a couple days (like going to Spring Training) with a group of friends or family, you really should try it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing view amazing food amazing service.  Our server Ashley (Jim) was fabulously and guided us through the adventure at the Rooste.  We ate the snake and filled up with generous portion sizes.  The slide was too busy to try and the kids were dancing up a storm to the live band.

A Must do in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this was my first time at Rustler's Roost.  I have heard about many times over the years as it is somewhat of a tourist landmark restaurant but never had the opportunity to try it.  The perfect opportunity arose last night when we had family in town and decided to give it a try.

This restaurant is situated at the top of a hill at the Arizona Grand Hotel.  The views are incredible and the feel and theme are really fun especially since we are right of the I-10.  It feels like you are in a small cowboy area in the middle of the city.  This is a family friendly place that is actually really good for kids as it is loud and your little ones won't be bothering anyone.  There is music 7 nights a week and it can be very crowded, despite the fact that the restaurant seats at least 500 not including the patio.  We were able to get a reservation as we were a larger group of 10 so that was nice.  The restaurant is very dim and we needed our smartphone flashlights in order to read them.  Thank goodness for technology.

The menu is what you would expect from a theme steak house.  The usual fare; steaks, chicken and some seafood with the typical side dishes.  I decided on the mixed grill which was very tender filet medallions and you had a choice of another meat and I chose the ribs.  They were also very good and tender.  The side veggie were carrots that were tasty but some were not cooked enough so they were tough.  We also all got cowboy beans (eh) and salad for the table as well as rolls that were kind of yucky.  For dessert, we opted to try the cowpie (how could you not?) which was basically chocolate covered coffee ice cream.  The description definitely sounded better than it tasted but it was ok to satisfy our sweet tooths.  The meals that my family had they enjoyed as well.  

This is definitely a place that I would come back to.  I would say it is a place to enjoy with friends or out of town guests if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"This place is not the best food in town, but it's such an experience.  If you live in the Valley, you need to check this place out.  Especially for a celebration."}
{"text":"A wonderful place that is fun for kids and adults.  Love taking people from out of town or for family celebrations."}
{"text":"I gave it a star because I had to.  I should have known when we walked in and the place was empty on a Friday night... the only thing good about the experience was the waiter. I think his name was Bobby, then there 30 years. 

First of the salad was fresh... right outta the bag!!! 
Ordered steak and ribs and the cowboy platter. The ribs were pure fat and sauce. The steak, I wonder if it was even steak?  The chicken was so dry I had to wash it down. 
Equivalent to Applebee's with a price tag that matches Charleston's. Waste of $180.00. Save your hard earned money. 
So disappointed we don't go out often so we try and make it special when we do.  Never again, back to Charleston's!!!"}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a great place to eat. It sits on a mountain so you can get a great view of the city as you eat. The staff is great, they even have a close up magician. Food was delicious too. If you live in Phoenix, you really need to eat at Rustler's Rooste at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Just had Thanksgiving dinner at Rustlers Rooste & it was wonderful. The place was packed. We were seated right away. We got a window table that looked out over the city lights. Awesome. We met Tom, our waitress was a sweerheart. Our food was out 15 minutes after ordering. We were treated like VIP'S. I will be telling everyone I can about this restaurant for a very long time. Thanks Tom for making my Thanksgiving with my Son's one that I won't ever forget. Your entire team is awesome."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars. Neat concept. Pretty good food but it was hit or miss. Our order is as follows:

* Complimentary Bread Basket - biscuits and fried Mexican bread. It was just ok. 
* Fried Rattlesnake and Cactus appetizer - it was good, though we liked the cactus a bit more than the rattlesnake. Rattlesnake was nothing special but a must try for us since we love trying new things. 
* Entrees include Beans, Family style salad, and cotton candy - beans were not good. Salad was very tasty. And who doesn't like cotton candy?
* Mixed Grill entree with Filet Medallions and Ribs - pretty good. Ribs were tasty. 
* Rustler's Cut - definite pass! First time my steak came out dry dry dry and was sent back. 2nd time they brought it out first bite was good and manager came to ask about it. He left, I took a second bite and reached a very raw steak. I guess they tried to cook it too fast and only 'seared' the outside. At that point I was pretty full so didn't say anything. 

Service: Our original waitress was flighty and couldn't seem to concentrate. Took bf's order then ran off. Brought us the salad and I had to ask to put my order in. Come our entrees and they brought out 3 plates... Wtf? Never came by to refill anything. Thankfully another nice waiter jumped in after seeing our frustration. From then on smooth sailing."}
{"text":"Ranch, ranch & more ranch.  If you are the kind of person that really loves ranch dressing, this place is for you.

The boyfriend made a reservation.... we had to wait 30 minutes for a table which didn't make much sense to me.

They bring enough food to feed a family of five so come hungry or be prepared to take boxes of leftovers home.  Yes, boxes.

I don't exactly remember what we ordered.. some sort of cowboy mixture of everything... chicken, steak, fish, potatoes, veggies, etc.  It was all piled up on a tray.  The ribs were great.  I'm from Kansas City so I like to think that I know a thing or two about bbq.  The meat slid off the bone, it was perfection.

I didn't get any cotton candy.  I guess they forgot about us.  :(  & I didn't get to slide down the slide... it was overrun with children.  So many filthy kids.  That slide was the best form of birth control I have ever seen in my life... no thank you.

It was cool place to visit once.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's so sad that I have to give this place two stars because of the service. I have never been or even heard of this place till I Googled family friendly restaurants. I saw that you can enter the restaurant on a slide and knew it was a go because the kids would dig that. We walk up and pass a huge stinky cow or ginormous something in the front. Kids were loving it. We walk up to the hostess stand and there are 3 hostesses and a manager standing there. One of them is blowing her nose into a napkin very loudly the whole time we stand there. Um.....aren't there bathrooms for that? My stomach did tiny somersaults of protest. We sit down and our server just sucked. She completely ruined my experience. The view is freaking amazing,. You can see the whole valley. It could have been my little hidden date gem but even that is not enough to lure me back. The server was rude to both my mother and I. She never told us about the specials, she never asked if I wanted my soft drink refilled, she never asked if I wanted dessert....she just plain sucked. Bland, slow, no personality. Then I had to hear her complain that the manager wouldn't give her Christmas off and how some other guy got it off claiming he was visiting family but his family is here etc................Dude! Take it to the kitchen! 
The food was good......I had the Fillet, mom - T-Bone. The steaks were cooked perfectly.....the bread was good with the pumpkin butter, not a big fan of the green beans and beans. After the nose blowing and attitude, I can't see any super compelling reason to return, even the sparkly city views. :("}
{"text":"Over 150 reviews for you to read about this mediocre steakhouse.  I ordered the St. Louis pork ribs which were very tender but slathered in a cloyingly sweet bbq sauce. The corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob, been in hot water a long long time!  Their cowboy beans were average at best,  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken, fairly good and lots of it (3 breasts with the bone deep fried) but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy, enough to sparely cover one breast.  The salad needed more dressing but was refreshing.  Best part of the meal was the Indian fry bread. The green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned.  The place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background.  I left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $40+ meal."}
{"text":"First, our waiter mumbled. Couldn't understand or hear a word he was saying.
Before some of my party arrived they slung the warm bread and butter on our table. Not impressed with the food at all! My prime rib was excellent but the rest of my meal, from the appetizers, which were served in a disgusting greasy deep fried tortilla bowl, to our COMPLETELY cold meals being served. To the Birthday girls steak being burned beyond recognition and looking like a piece of jerky to asking for condiment and waiting ten minutes for it! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! Never again. The food and the service SUCKED. We made reservations and was not that busy when we went. Never Again!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality about this tourist trap is just the view.  

Having brought several friends and family members to Rustler's Rooste over the years to enjoy the view of the valley, the average over-priced food and carnival atmosphere (pushy magicians working for table tips) were often overlooked.  My last visit was on 4/1 and will definitely be my last.

The Rooste was quite busy for a Sunday, we had been told it would be a 45 minute wait to be seated (despite empty tables), which turned into an hour long wait, and then with a 3 month old baby in tow, we were seated above the band, which was obnoxiously loud and wasn't the most appropriate choice for a newborn.  It was IMPOSSIBLE to have any kind of conversation.  

Our waiter gave us some bread and butter and then told us he'd get come back shortly and take our drink orders, but after passing our table a half dozen times in 15 minutes, he didn't seem too interested in making sure we had beverages, so we got up and left.  

Consider checking out other local establishments in South Phx/Tempe, like The Farm at South Mountain, Los Dos Molinos, The House at Secret Garden, Amano Bistro, and etc before considering this tourist trap."}
{"text":"Are here for an event and it was as expected. Food was fair at best and cocktails were sugary.
Felt like Disney."}
{"text":"First time here and I think it's awesome! Live country music, a live bull, great steaks and service! The interior is rustic and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Beautiful city views, fun atmosphere & good steak. Can be a bit pricey but to me its worth it."}
{"text":"Took my Dad here on a Saturday night for his birthday. It was a great experience from start to finish. They sat us in front of a window with a fabulous view of the valley and the sunset. The server Nichole was so friendly and attentive. We both ordered the \"Wrangler\" (a bone-in Ribeye) and I asked for it to be cooked medium rare but with a nice charred crust - not an easy thing to execute but they nailed it. My dad's steak was also cooked just the way he wanted it. The sides were equally tasty. At the end of the meal a bunch of servers came out and sang happy birthday to my dad, and gave us the biggest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen (with candles that would not blow out!). It was rich and delicious. The manager said the cake is one of only 3 things on the menu that they don't make from scratch at the restaurant (they have a bakery they use). Apparently, they also have their own Butcher on the property. As far as the building goes, it has a lot of history and was used as a mineshaft long ago. It's on the grounds of the beautiful Arizona Grand Resort. It also looks to be a good time for kids with a slide down into the dining room and there's live bands that play on the weekends. I recommend this place and will definitely be going back soon to try their menu item \"Cowboy Stuff\" - which is a variety of chicken, seafood, & beef. From the looks of the menu everything seems to be priced at a good value."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and good food.  I had the popcorn snake cut out of a Diamondback.  Uhmmm...after a few bites, I couldn't stop thinking of what I was actually eating...the reptile that I despise the most.  But for the most part, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've only been here one time.  Went a few weeks ago with a few girls on a Sat. night.  It was surprisingly slow.  

I am NOT at all into country music or country anything, but being in here made me wish I had some cute cow-girl boots on.  (I did not eat here.)

The positives:
-a big bull outside the bar/restaurant
-a SLIDE from the main level down to the lower level!
-live music 
-decent drinks for a fair price

The negatives:
-the bull smells 
-the little kids hog the slide
-the music is country 
-nobody was there

I imagine this place would be tons more fun if you know how to line dance and there was a good crowd.

P.S. don't park in the lower parking lot and walk up...there is a ton of parking if you drive up the windy steep hill"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week for a double birthday and I have to say I was a little weirded out at first, but kudos to the atmosphere. Since we all had never been, we decided to get the Cowboy something or other and for $20 a head, man was there a lot of food! I highly recommend getting this if it's your first time because you get to sample pretty much everything they have to offer. I now know the next time I come here I'll be ordering the delish ribs. They just melt in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Rustler's Roost last night with some out of town guests.  The atmosphere and the rustic look to the place was definitely a plus and the views were amazing... I see why so many past reviewers said the sunset was to die for!

We started off in the saloon for happy hour.  Discounted prices on their appetizers ($3 each) and a brewsky.  They serve all the adult beverages in mason jars which added a nice flair to the place.  The zucchini logs were to die for...  I was looking forward to dinner!

I ordered the top sirloin that was \"prime\" that they had highlighted on the menu.  It came with homemade rolls/biscuits, family style salad for the table to share, green beans, beans (tasty!) and corn on the cob.  The steak was cooked perfectly (rare) but I didn't feel that it had too much flavor.  Don't get me wrong -- I still ate almost all of it!  

My favorite part of the evening had to be the magician that came by our table.  He really was entertaining and had me mind boggled  in the 5 minutes he was at our table \"tricking\" us.  

Definitely will be visiting the Rooste again!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have been in the mood for a place like this but I was tired and hungry and irritated that they didn't do take out.  However, I decided I'd go it alone (I was traveling for business), make my order, get a to go box and be on my way.  This is the kind of place you don't want to go it alone. Not because it's scary but because it is TOTALLY lame when you're alone.  I had no idea it would be so, hmmm, country and lively?  

The building sits atop the city on a hill.  Would love to have seen it during the daylight as well.  And it's big! As soon as you get to the entrance you're greeted by a longhorn steer named Horney.  When you enter you climb your way into the restaurant through a wooden path that looks like an old mine.  Think amusement park ride.  Then when you get in it is BUSY! People everywhere. Floors are uneven. Loud, live music.  It would have been a 45 minute wait so I opted for a seat at the bar.  However, the woman who sat me didn't explain that if you sit at the bar you can only order appetizers. Well she was in luck because that's all I wanted, but it would have been nice to know that was my option!

I came for the rattlesnake bites and cactus fries, but ended up also ordering some wings because you only get about an ounce of meat with the rattlesnake bites.  The bartender, though busy, did find the time to take my order and tried to accommodate me. Looking around at the sea of bodies, I completely understood why he wasn't super attentive.  The food was ok. I just wanted to add another unique food to my list.  The rattlesnake was heavily breaded, chewy and kind of like chicken. Not much meat in those bites, though. The accompanying sauce...ick.  There were plenty of cactus fries and they reminded me of fried pickles.  The wings were delicious!  So glad I got those because I wasn't a big fan of the fries after the first few bites.  

If I make it back to Phoenix, I might give it another go (but will try a steak or something else). Like I said, it's better with company.  If you're looking for a quick to go order on a business trip on a night where you're dead tired, I'd just avoid it.  It sounds like this place could be quite an adventure. From the website:

Rustler's Rooste has it all.  Our critter out front, an enormous long horn steer named Horney greets you upon arrival.  Open the door and enter part of an old mine shaft to the top floor to our Mountaintop Saloon.  Saunter over the indoor waterfall and take our Famous \"Tin\" Slide into the dining room. (for the faint of heart, there's a staircase).   Enjoy the live country western band and our strolling cardshark/magician.  The building is bordered on the north side by plate glass windows so there is a view form every seat in the house. Rustler's Rooste was founded in 1971 and is still family owned and operated.  The legend goes that the original site, atop a butte in the foothills of South Mountain, was a hideout for cattle rustlers.  Today it is firmly established as the valley's highest and brightest beacon of the total cowboy western experience."}
{"text":"Based on the food, I would give this place 2 stars, but ambiance and atmosphere earned it a third. It was like a maze getting to our table with the hills and turns and stairs inside the restaurant...There was a band playing country music, which isn't normally my preference but it suits this place perfectly. And the band wasn't so loud you had to shout over them, which is also nice. I ordered the garden burger and it was decent enough. I substituted sweet potato fries which were good, but not spectacular.  The rest of the table ordered steaks, mostly filets which came with green beans.  The salad the comes with the entrees is a house salad and they have one dressing, a house-made ranch. I'd have to say they definitely save the best part for last... A big can (yes, i said can) of cotton candy!!  Will I go back??  Ehhh.... It would have to be the right circumstance."}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times. I agree that the first is the best experience. The atmosphere is way different from other fine dining here in AZ. They have live band, a good bar @ the second floor with a great view of the city. When you enter the place , you might get overwhelmed with stuff. Like there's a cow in front, a slide for kids, the band might be playing or people dancing to the songs. It simple has that \"let's do party\" atmosphere!

Now with the food. For the times I ate here, I can tell that the best food that they offer is the beans. Other their beans they don't offer anything that can make you remember the place forever. Big portions but unfortunately the flavors are are not that delicious:(

For the price that your paying I think its more of the atmosphere than the food that you're actually paying. But its still something that everyone has to experience!

At least try it once I am pretty sure you're gonna love the experience."}
{"text":"My son made reservations for Mother' s day for our family and specifically requested handicapped accessible  seating.  Upon arrival we found we were seated  upstairs,  not on the main level by the handicapped entrance.  When I asked the location of the elevator I was told they don't have one...\"it called legs\".  (not a good response for an Iraq veteran in a wheelchair).  After being told to go back outside and up the main entrance to the upper level we found the seating involved steps.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training."}
{"text":"Took my family from Ohio here and we had a great experience!  Our server was great and so was the food.  My steak wasn't cooked correctly the first time so when they brought out a new one they brought a while new meal, not just the steak.  My husband and dad shared the \"cowboy stuff \" and the slung of food was amazing! Great views and free cotton candy for dessert.  Sit near the indoor slide if you want to wear the kids out.  Check out Horney the bull out front."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. First of all it's super loud in there. Secondly it's so dark you can hardly see your food. Honestly I'd bet they keep it dark so you can't see your food because if you could you definitely wouldn't eat it. My husband ordered steak. It was so fatty, flavorless and gross. To top it off my husband now has food poisoning! We will never ever go back."}
{"text":"I'm welcomed by Horny, the most pampered bull in the Valley with his diva-like attitude. I walk in the doors and I'm immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams \"take the slide you coward!!\" OK, what the hay right? After I've recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers. 

You have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler's Rooste. 

Rustler's Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you're in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I've been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it's endless hours of childhood fun. 

The food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you're really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics. 

I've been to several events at Rustler's Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It's a romantic must. 

As if the night couldn't possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler's Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the true southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler's Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler's Rooste!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn between 2 and 3 stars for this one. It had been over 20 years since it was the last time I was here so it was fun to be back. The building and slide was just how I remembered it and not much has changed over the years. 

Was recently there for my HS reunion and was kind of surprised that the reunion was held outside on the patio in the middle of Nov at night. While they did have heaters your really couldn't venture to far without being cold quickly. We arrived and received one food ticket. My boyfriend and I had the steak (chicken was the other option) and the sides were beans, corn a roll and salad. The steak looked good until we cut into it...man was it DRY and COLD! I love a good steak but I could barely cut into it much less eat it. I was so hungry I managed to eat 1/2 of it before I was so tired of chewing this tasteless piece of meat. What also wasn't good was that we couldn't get more sides so we were both hungry and after paying $70 each it was very disappointing. 

One good thing was the great view from the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. We got here on a Friday night. It was crazy busy. We had to wait for an hour for our table. We already had our drink and snack at the bar and we were full by the time our food got at our table. There was live music but it was so crazy busy that you were not able to enjoy the country music. Kids were crying and running all over the place. I have a 6 year old son but this was beyond tolerable. 

The steak was ok and very very over priced. Our host was nice and courteous. Portions are big and very American. No sophistication and no flare. Nothing especial. 

There are magicians and ballon folders walking among the guests. You have to also pay them because it is not nice to be jerk. It feels like you are in a big carnival and nobody cares for you and they just want you to pay more. 

I believe if you come in the middle of the week, you may have a different experience. This was my first and last. I can go to 2 nicer restaurant with the money I spent here. I am so mad and disappointed.

If you are someone who cares about your food and ambience, this is not a place for you."}
{"text":"I would've likede to make this a 2.5 starts.
I like kitschy places and this place is like Hee Haw on crack! For those under 40, paste this link into your browser:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hee_Haw  then go to YouTube, watch some episodes, then you will have a point of reference and finally get the joke.
The location is fantastic with incredible views. I've eaten here three times and it seems that each time I go, the food gets a little more mediocre. Perhaps the first time I went I was too bedazzled by all the kitschy cowboy-ness to realize the food was not that great. They have a massive stinky bull penned outside complete with the flies going in and out of his nostrils (whom I feel kinda sorry for) Think kid from UNICEF commercial but replace the kid with a bull with massive horns. (Bad joke I know, but hey comedy is sometimes cruel.)
There is a slide you can go down. There's a live band playing country music in the center of it all. There are cowboys and cowgirls serving. They have a gift shop where you can buy funny and gross things like scorpion in a sucker and chocolate covered horse turds. Well not really but the sucker is real. You get cotton candy with the bill. A gimmicky whirlwind of Southwestern yee-haw! Good for parties, great for kids, huge corporate BBQ's held in a massive building outside blah blah blah you get the idea.
The food: well, kinda underwhelming considering how hard they work to create a fun atmosphere.
I have tried the deep-fried rattle snake. Don't bother. It's mainly tiny chunks of tasteless mystery meat  (snake? gopher? lizard?) over-breaded and over fried. You could hack up your worn out Old Navy belt and cook it up the same way with a similar result in terms of food experience.
I have had steak, fried chicken and the beef ribs. All were just ok. The ribs have way too much BBQ sauce. The fried chicken was kinda dry. My steak was cooked just right, but sat waiting to hit the table too long and was almost cold. 
The last time we went we took my mother and her friend who were visiting from back east. It was around xmas time and kinda chilly outside. It was also pretty chilly INSIDE as the place is drafty and I don't think they even bother trying to heat it. All of our hot food was tepid by the time we strapped on the ol' feed-bags.
The salads come out family style and are literally drowning in dressing. The salad however is probably the only item on the menu besides maybe desserts that comes out at the right temperature.
Everyone on Yelp is right: that for what you get, you pay way too much. There shouldn't be anything on that menu over $20.00 a plate. It's just not that good.
However, the cocktails are good and it is an interesting place to take visitors as I said the view is worth at least one visit. I suggest you head up for happy Hour, have a couple cheap appies, then head down the mountain for a quick drive downtown to a nice steakhouse like Durant's  for the main event.
I get the impression that this place has been resting on its' laurels for many years, and has stopped even trying to put out good food. It's slop-n-drop at best.  They figure diners will be too overwhelmed by the Cowpoke Carnival going on all around them to notice the food is meh and the prices are YIKES!! Think I'll mosey on to greener pastures when I got a hankerin' to sink my teeth into a nice grilled slab of cow!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we've had here! Horrible service and just okay food. After starting out okay, it quickly went downhill. Our server forgot to order a drink, forgot a dessert, forgot cotton candy, took 15 minutes to get extra scoops of ice cream, and in general was just missing at the end of our meal. Then when the check comes, it's auto gratuity, which is calculated wrong AND calculated on the after tax total. Apparently it's done on the computer, but it's wrong. Despite all this, the manager did not seem to care. Not sure we'll come back after this experience. It's been an annual tradition, but we'll just go to Aunt Chilada's and spend less. I mentioned this to a manager who could have cared less. Such s disappointment!"}
{"text":"First time here, it's a great location , and nice view.
Inside ,it's a bee hive , Saturday eve, most of the place is reserved tables, and the rest is crowded. 
They have a band that starts at 6 and ends at ten, so if you come to hete music, get here early. The band is on a level all on itself. Sitting in the upstairs bar, can barley here them. If you go downstairs to the other bar, only two small tables. Not sure where one would go to listen ? 
But, the food is plentiful and oh so good. Filet was perfect, great bread and honey butter. Corn, tasty.
The Best, is the beef ribs. OMG, ive ever had any better. Blackened and tasty, and all you can eat. After, 10, I was stuffed. 
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to see a 3 star rating. I find this place spectacular! 
First off, the setting is on south mountain (I think that's what its called??). Point is, the restaurant is composed of huge windows so you get a lovely view of the city. 
Some nights, they have a country band playing. 
So I'm from Texas so I'm a harsh critic off \"good\" bbq (glad they brought Rudys to Phoenix)... anywho,  the bbq here is very good. We ordered the platter for 2. It's more like a platter for 4!! There were enough leftovers for the next day! I wished I could eat more because it was so good - but I just couldn't! It came with ribs, chicken, salmon kabobs, steak kabobs, baked beans, Cole slaw, veggies... 
Then our server was a complete doll. So attentive and engaging."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to this restaurant several years ago with a group of co-workers during Christmas season.  We enjoyed it.  In our quest to find some good prime rib we decided to visit again.  All the other reviewers who spoke about the view are correct and I won't repeat those comments here.  We requested and received a nice table with a view.  We were there on a Friday night at 6 pm.  Big mistake.  The place was loaded with families with kids.  I don't know if kids eat free on Friday night or whether there was a deal with the next door Arizona Grand Resort, but there were kids everywhere.  Fortunately, most of them were well behaved but there are always a few squawkers.  If you are looking for a romantic place for a nice dinner with your sweetie, this ain't it.  This is a country and western themed restaurant with a live band blaring C&W music all night.  Servers all wear cowboy hats and cowboy clothes.  Most male customers are wearing baseball caps.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that, just know what you are getting into before you go.  When our server first approached our table he said, \"I'm a little backed up so it'll be a bit before I can get to you.\"  Okay.  About 15 minutes later he came back and took our drink order.  Fifteen minutes later the beverages arrived.  Another 10-15 minutes passed before he returned to take our dinner order.  It was another 20 minutes before our entrée arrived.  We ordered our prime rib medium rare, which according to their menu has red inside.  The two slabs we received looked as if they had been under a heat lamp for 15-30 minutes with brownish spots covering the meat.  Cut open, both pieces were at least medium, if not medium well.  Reluctant to spend more time in the cacophony of noise from the kids that inundated the place, we took a few bites.  The meat was totally unseasoned and needed a healthy dose of salt.  I had a huge pile of cooked sliced carrots on my plate.  They were also bland and cooked nearly to mush.  When the waiter came back we asked for to-go boxes.  He commented that it did not seem as if we had been very hungry.  I don't usually say anything because the server has no control of what comes out of the kitchen, but we showed him our meat and he agreed that neither piece was anywhere near medium rare.  He graciously thanked us for our comments and said he was going to send a manager over.  Within a minute the manager was at our table.  After explaining our situation he stated that he wanted to bring us each another piece of prime rib and he would ensure that it was medium rare.  Within 5 minutes he was back with two full plates of food.  Both pieces of meat were medium rare!  We thanked him for his assistance and he thanked us for bringing this to his attention.  We were very grateful for the way in which this situation was handled.  If it had not been for that I would have give a 2-star rating.  We were not impressed with the quality of food, emphasis seems to be on quantity, and thought the price was very high - $100 for two dinners and two drinks, including tip (which was 20% to the server who handled our concerns with grace).  So, if you are looking for a steak house to take out-of-towners whom you think will be impressed with a \"Cowboy\" atmosphere, this might be your place.  If you are celebrating a special occasion and want to impress your sweetie with your elegance, go elsewhere.  Different strokes for different folks."}
{"text":"Dad is in town. and dad loves steak, cowboy themed stuff, and the wild west. only problem...dad is getting old and can't do any hiking or exploring some of the real western history and that's where dining at the Rooste comes to par. 
i called and they didn't take reservations this saturday night, however, when we arrived, she asked if i called ahead, which i replied no. it's an hour wait. AN HOUR!? holy moly....i wouldn't wait an hour for bianco pizza, much less a kitschy tourist restaurant....but....i could hear my father in my ear saying \"wow, this place looks neat!\" and thus...we waited...an hour....at the bar....for our table.

the bar was basically empty at 5:30 so we had a couple of beers (around 4bucks each...way too expensive) and bided our time. at 6pm, the line out the door was enormous, along with the clientele. after an hour, we were taken downstairs and seated right in front of the band, which was fun. the sawdust covered floor added to the appeal of the place and to my father. i ordered the swordfish which was cooked perfectly. my father, the T-bone, and he said it was cooked wonderfully. our dog thoroughly enjoyed the bone afterwards. 

our server was prompt, friendly, and was always available without being overbearing. even with a huge wait list to get in, we never felt rushed to finish our meal. prices are a tad high, my fish was 20 bucks. but you get a basic iceberg salad, a basket of really warm and tasty rolls and biscuits, and a pot of baked beans (with pork), so it's a decent deal for visiting relatives. 

but some things to consider....walking up the hill from the lower parking lot proved very difficult for my aging father, but they do offer a shuttle from the lot to the door. even to get to the concierge can be challenging (it also is a slight uphill walk inside the restaurant) for elderly or handicapped persons. the concierge girl is NOT friendly at all, but that's almost to be expected with the throngs of people that come here. prices are a bit high, especially for drinks. the sheer mass of people eating here can be a bit overwhelming, and there are screaming kids EVERYWHERE! parents don't bother to tend to their ill-behaved kids, and it can be a nightmare if you don't have the ability to drown out their ever present running around and screaming. 

but....the place is neat. exposed rock wall, a slide, and the view of phoenix from the hillside is amazing!"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place to go for ambiance if not food. BBQ places to me are pretty much all the same when it comes to food, as I really can't tell the difference between a $10 and $30 steak. Sometimes I even eat them -gasp- medium well. Scenery's great."}
{"text":"I had a really high expectation of this restaurant but it turns out to be a disappointment. 

We came on a Wednesday night so the parking wasn't bad and we got really good services. It's really a bummer that the food is a big turn down. Rattlesnake is way too over cooked and so as the ribs.. probably the best thing would be the beer. Really hope they can do some improvement on their food. 

It's an okay restaurant after all, giving the fact that the interior decor is fun and the view is great. But I probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Location: very unique up on small mountain side. Provides a very nice view. Decent amount of parking. 

Service: very good. Very friendly hostess and waiter. 

Food quality: rolls and salad tasted good. Nothing mind blowing but good. I ordered the rib eye. Not bad. Also not good. Imagine buying the lowest level grade steak from the store and cooking it without much thought. No crazy spices. Edible but not great. Came with vegetables that didn't look terribly healthy. I wasn't expecting fine dining but was hoping for more. Was there with 4 other people and the feeling towards the food was mutual among us. 

Ambiance: it was ok. A bit loud but I was sort of expecting that after walking past the huge smelly bull out front :) I did take the slide which was funny. 

Would I come back:  unlikely. I'm glad we tried it so I can say I've tried it but the food wasn't terribly enjoyable and it certainly wasn't cheap so there are much better options in that part of town."}
{"text":"Great place to bring out of town guests.  Food is not for a foodie.....just great views with a fun slide in the middle of the restaurant.  Sunset views on the patio.  Great for large corporate or group events that wants a Phoenix Western Style Chuck wagon cookout."}
{"text":"Go on a weeknight. It is less crowded and the kitchen is not as busy as it is during the weekends. Also get there around dusk. Hopefully, you will take a ride down the sliding board on the way to your table that provides a great sunset and evening view of the valley. 

It is not the best steak place I have ever been to, but I have always enjoyed the steaks and the prime rib is very good as well. When in season you can get rattlesnake bites as an appetizer, but I prefer the fried mushrooms. Service has typically been friendly and fairly fast. It is a western casual restaurant and is fun place to go for a good steak."}
{"text":"Well let's see, the waitress was terrible, asked for water twice, third times a charm.  The food is average at best, I think they have to go to the basement to make the drinks, not really sure but very slow coming.  Oh, the view is very nice, best thing going with this establishment.  I had a filet which should have been tender and delish , not the case, dry and fatty.  The folks behind us are complaining as I write this.  Seriously don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Worth checking out the view (and the slide) but everything -- from appetizers to drinks to entrees -- is drastically overpriced! If you have money to burn and are looking for kitsch, this is your spot. Otherwise, pick some place else..."}
{"text":"Worst service!!!! I ordered a steak medium well it came out swimming in blood :( asked to fix it and they destroyed it. The waitress and manager very inattentive and rude. Even though it is a beautiful view do not expect what you are paying for you get $5 service and good at a $25 price. The bus boy was the most attentive person at our table :)"}
{"text":"I went here for my wife's work party. The atmosphere isn't really my bag of chips. But I would have loved this place when I was younger. The slide and the music. The views are great. I had the grilled swordfish and I was actually impressed, as good seafood is hard to come by in the desert. I don't think I would go here again unless is way paid for mainly cause it is really busy and just not the type of restaurant I like to spend money on. Its a great place for tourists."}
{"text":"Great service. The food is delicious. The portions of cowboy stuff meal is big!  Plenty for 2."}
{"text":"A great place for Family!!! Wait time was 40 minutes but went by so quick. Bar, slide, music all available while you wait. The food was excellent, service was quick."}
{"text":"Poor selection of gins (3). Burger at the bar. 2 on a scale of 5. Service was good. Would not return."}
{"text":"Well let me see where do I start.....well I guess I will start with the view. The establishment sits near South Mountain here in phoenix and I must tell you the view is simply breathtaking. There is plenty of outdoor seating and that is a must do if you visit this place because again the view of the city and the surrounding mountains are not to be missed. My wife's company IKON office solutions hosted there annual party for the employees here and it was first class all the way. The gave away tons of prizes....check the photos I posted.....and everyone was so friendly.

This establishment is huge, which makes it great for hosting huge office parties like these. We had our own venue out back large enough to hold about 300 people or more and we still could move around. We didn't have to worry about disturbing other customers....because they were in the main dining hall of this establishment which is a throwback to the western days. There is live music and even an old school slide that you can ride down from the second level to the main eating level. There is also a huge steer out front as you come into the establishment....that's right a real life Texas steer....maybe not from Texas though....LOL.

Now as for the food....well they served us BBQ chicken and ribs and I must say the Chicken was great....didn't try the ribs however....sorry....but my wife liked them. There were also baked beans...while not great...were not bad either. They also served homemade biscuits....corn on the cob...and there was a great garden salad as well. There was an open bar  for everyone to enjoy.....and I must say again the service....atmosphere...staff....food presentation....and ambience of this establishment were top notch.

WARNING......WARNING.....WARNING....be advised that the parking here can be very bad. There is very limited parking on the \"Main Hill\" i will call it....right in front of the restaurant. There is plenty of parking \"Down Hill\"....which means you have to walk back up to reach the establishment....and trust me that is more than a notion folks. If your not in fairly good shape I recommend letting them valet park your car which is free....but tips are accepted....and you may have to wait awhile for you car when your ready to leave because they are pretty busy.

The other option is taking there shuttle bus....but you may be waiting for it as well. Since I am in pretty good shape I just walked back up the hill...but I would not advise that. Just wanted to put that out there because this city and state has a lot of elderly people and I would hate for them to come to this establishment and face this problem. So if your even in the mood for a little western adventure and great southwest cuisine visit rustler's Rooste and as always Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"We go as a family several times a year. The menu is pretty simple and everything starts with salad served family style accompanied by biscuits and fry bread. I always order the all you can eat BBQ beef ribs and they are excellent. I personally believe that these are the best value on the menu. I take the bones home for my dogs, and they love them. The steaks look good, as does the prime rib. Fine dining it isn't, but it's a fun place with live music ,balloon artists and a magician making the rounds at the tables. Their is a slide that can take you down to the dining room, or you can enter the more traditional way. Lighten up and take the slide."}
{"text":"What a treat!  This Western themed restaurant is as hokey as it gets.  We went to Rustler's Rooste for a rehearsal dinner and the set-up outside was pretty cool with city views.  Between the rattlesnake appetizers, fried shrimp, bbq chicken and the many libations, we had good time.  The food was only mediocre, but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining.

One plus for the family folks is that kids...LOTS of kids are welcome.  There is a fenced-in bull when you walk in and a slide with lots of screaming kiddos.  The prices are a little steep for the quality but it is a tourist trap, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Great steaks. Really fun atmosphere. Slide right in the restaurant to slide down to the dinner table. Cotton candy for dessert"}
{"text":"This place could be so good... So much potential.

Our served failed to tell us about the family style salad, and that our meals came with any sides. A sad salad was plopped down in front of us. He didn't suggest any of the fun appetizers like the rattlesnake. Shrimp was on par with red lobster. It would have been nice if the menu included a description of the dishes accompaniment. I would have never ordered the jumbo sautéed shrimp if I had know it came with wild rice and lemon. And was not actually sautéed. 

Music was great, atmosphere fun and the view was amazing. Kick it up in the kitchen a few notches please."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place, the reviews aren't that great but I had a lot of fun here.  There was live music and dancing.  Our server was awesome and a guy came by and did a magic show for us while we waited for our food.  There was TONS of food - bread, lots of sides, there's no way you're not going home without a togo box.  To eat I had the shrimp which was pretty good.  Then complimentary cotton candy for dessert!  The view was fantastic.  This has got to be one of the best places for a family meal - it's quite an experience!"}
{"text":"There is definitely no culinary maestro in the kitchen here. We have been here several times and nothing that we have ever eaten has been amazing. The food is mediocre at best.    However.... The view and atmosphere are worth the average food experience. The live music, real bull out front as you walk in, slide down to your table, fry bread and biscuits before your meal, free cotton candy after the meal and a awesome view makes this place a come back to experience."}
{"text":"What a great place to take an out-of-towner. The view is amazing. 

The Rooste has been family owned since 1971 and alot of the staff is family. They all do a great job keeping you entertained too. 

I cannot comment on the food but the staff and building/view are great."}
{"text":"My waiter was 100% wonderful I love the way he tend to us he felt a little stress I understand because of a busy night but I let them know and reassure him that everything was all right. I will always recommend this place for multiple people to go that's the best place to eat most happiest environment I've ever been in the view is very beautiful from the sky top all you see is the City of Tempe and Phoenix"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant my kids always choose for their birthdays. It's fun, it's loud, music is rockin...and who can forget the slide?! Plus you can't go wrong with their barbecued chicken or the cotton candy for dessert. It's so good!"}
{"text":"Sing it one more time Bo Brooks! :) 

Cause got friends in low places,
where the whiskey drowns (with my ginger ale)
and the beer (in jugs) chases my blues away,
but I'll be okay 

Now I'm not big on social places (yeahhhh right!)
think I'll slip on to the Rustler's Rooste
Oh I got friends, 
in great places! (my prime rib was fat and yummy!)

I guess I was right this place I belong
and yes I will return, cause everythings alright, (and scenic I might add)
and I can't say goodnight, and I'll show myself to the dance floor, (live band awesome!)
Hey I did mean to cause a big scene, (my two step ain't all that :( )
just give me more than an hour and then, 
I'll be as high as South Mountain and you'll always know!!!"}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a fun, lively place to take your family when staying at the Arizona Grand Resort.  The live music, slide into the dining room, and gigantic bull outside all combine to make this a unique adventure.  The  views from the outside patio are stunning and it's a good place to take hyper, fidgeting kids to let off some steam before or after dinner.  

The steaks are good, though I can think of a few other restaurants that have better.  The rolls and fry bread served complimentary with your meal are excellent, as are the cowboy beans.  Service can get a bit backed up a times so bring a little patience if you're going on a weekend or holiday. 

Overall, this is a fantastic place for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"I give the Rooste this rating due to location and ambiance.  All my steaks are over-cooked on every occasion, but the location is great and there is a cool cowboy band.  The kids can be loud and even get cotton candy on the house for dessert.  Oh, there is a two-story slide.  Overall, this is a Phoenix staple but don't except a four-star steakhouse and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I've seen the light from I10 for the last 3 years since I've moved to Phoenix, and I've always was curious about this place. The setting and I assumed the views would be spectacular. So when my Uncle's Family came to visit from the Midwest, I decided to treat my Uncle for his Birthday at Rustler's Roost.  Let me just say that this place is not for everyone. Certainly not for someone who is about to celebrate his 78th.  At first impression, the place is Chaotic and LOUD.  Did I mention that it is LOUD.  If you like your dinner with a side of Screeching Teenage Girls and sing a long Happy Birthday, then welcome home.  Of the 2 hours that we were there, about an hour and a half were spent listening to that musical, over and over again. My uncle was not amused! I was embarrassed that brought the family in to this spectacle.  What is ironic, is that the food wasn't actually bad at all. My medium rare filet was very tender and flavorful.  No one at the table complained about the food.  Unfortunately, the setting made you forget the nice meal."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I've come here and it's still a mixed bag. Overall, our dining experience was okay. Not bad or awful, not great, more like: mmmmmeeh leaning slightly towards a frustrating okay. The waiter was friendly but we would go 10 - 15 minutes before seeing him again, although he didn't do a bad job and was knowledgeable of the menu and when we did see him he did a decent job. I remember having a sub-par steak before and after reading the recent reviews prior to ordering, I decided to order the prime rib on the waiters recommendation. It honestly was not that bad at all and was tender and flavorful. It's not world class mind you, but it's decent. The salad and other items that come with the meal are also just okay. The Indian Fry Bread however is superb. The star of the whole meal in fact. It comes with cinnamon butter and is really good. The reason however that I am giving two stars is because the meal took two hours when it should have taken one. Everything is so slow and with young kids, the slide lasts only so long. By the time the check finally came the kids were bouncing off the walls. The bill was a lot more expensive for an \"average\" quality meal at best and it kind of felt like a final stamp on the overall experience. I just wanted to get out of there at that point. Overall - I don't see myself ever going back, which is a shame because it could be so much better with a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was very good, our order arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was if average taste. 

If you sit near the windows be careful when leaving because the restaurant is very dark, the floors are slippery and uneven."}
{"text":"Invited out of town guests to Rustler's Rooste for dinner last night. I selected the location primarily for the view and a solid menu. The website indicated that the restaurant takes reservations but when I called, I was informed that there is a \"call ahead\" list rather than an actual reservation option. The purpose of the call ahead list is to shorten your wait time.  

I arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy. I was given a buzzer to notify me when our table was ready and told the wait would be 20-30 minutes. I think our wait was around the 30 minute mark.

When we were seated, we had a decent view but the restaurant was so amazingly loud, we had to practically scream at each other to be heard during the entire meal. We were competing with what felt/sounded like thousands of other diners who were all doing the same. There were a number of birthdays being celebrated while we were there and for each one the staff would come through with an insanely loud dinner triangle, accompanied by a shouted announcement and singing. It was impossible to have a conversation when this happened.

Our waiter was clearly run ragged. He did what he could to keep up with the drink refils but that's about it. Ordering was a chore because he wasn't able to hear us over the din. The food was pretty basic. I had the salmon, which was good. My  husband had the ribs, which were good and our guests each had steak. Neither of the steaks were cooked as ordered. 

Along with being loud, the restaurant was very dark and our table lantern was out. We inquired about getting it lit and that took our overworked waiter almost the entire duration of the meal to manage. Once we got it lit, it was still very dark. 

My husband and I had been to Rustler's Rooste once before for Easter Brunch and we were pleased with the service and food. Last night, however, was a less than enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I took the kids here while on a staycation and  I'm not sure if I just don't remember it being bad or if something has changed. When asked what they were known for the answer was Prime Rib. I asked for Medium Rare, I got well done. The second attempt came back rare but I ate it anyway. I've had lots of Prime Rib, this was completely tasteless. My wife ordered the Country Fried Chicken and it too was lacking taste and was very dry. Not sure if we'll be back but if we do, I'm definitely trying the ribs."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! My girlfriends and I surprised our friend with a bachelorette party here and we all loved it!! Very beautiful at night on the balcony!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the valley for 20 years and have never come up here for dinner. My husband made reservations and we had a very short wait on a Friday night in the summer. Now in the winter not sure about the wait time.

We got there just before sunset and it was amazing. The view is beyond breathtaking and worth the drive alone. 

Once at our table the menu was a bit confusing as it looked like a newspaper with nothing inside. They charge for soda water which is a bummer...but plain water is okay. 

The salad is served family style with the dressing already on it. I just asked for more plain salad to mix with the other salad. The dressing is very good. I ordered a steak well done and I should have ordered either pork chicken or salmon. I am not a big steak eater. Of course it was a bit dry and chewy. The corn was to die for as were the steamed veggies. The cowboy beans were okay just not my thing. The biscuits were a bit tasteless but the honey butter added flavor but I wasn't wanting to eat that much of it.

They do have dessert but the stock standard is bringing cotton candy to everyone. You can line  dance and enjoy the patio overlooking the city for as long as you want too. Will come again."}
{"text":"We use to love this place.  The parking lot was full which made us regret choosing this place to eat. But when we got inside and seated it wasnt that busy.  All of the staff was very nice, our server Rebecca wasnt at all. No enthusiasm, it took forever to bring the bill so i just handed her my form of payment.  She came back with the bill, no credit card, no pen...and then decided to walk past our table a few times then chat up another table.  My boyfriend had to get up and tell her that she had my card while on his way to take our 4yr old to the slide bc we knew it would be a while.  She was tired and was getting cranky.  Rebecca looked lost for a minute then walked away to process the payment and return with a pen.  The steak had no flavor but was cooked perfect, like i have seen in previous reviews.  I use to be a server and know how to tip...that was the hardest tip i had to give."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending Rustler's Rooste for my company's Christmas party. The restaurant is really fun and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. The slide...is awesome! The view and patio are also great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the meats we were served at the luncheon. The steak was more than well done and the chicken was dry. I know if I came back to the restaurant and had the chance to order something else, I would be happy. Also, for some reason, I couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi. I would have loved to post on social media that I was there but my phone wouldn't connect.  

I want to come back sometime in the evening to enjoy music, the view and the company. I will return!"}
{"text":"What is this place?

I was attending a conference in Scottsdale and one of the night activities was dinner and line dancing at the Rustler's Rooste. On the way to the Rooste I pulled up my Yelp app and perused through some pics. If you have never been here before I can safely say that the Rustler's Rooste not only live up to but exceeded my expectations of the pictures online.

Here are some highlights:
*There is a massive longhorn in front of the rooste. You can smell it from the parking lot.
*The slide down to the lower level is worth taking. The slide is short and fast (that's what she said)
*Views from the outside are spectacular! Definietely a great venue for large parties.
*The live music is a nice touch especially for the line dancing.
*Staff was fast and friendly.

Overall I'm glad I was able to \"experience\" Rustler's Rooste. Although the banquet style steaks were a bit tough and the fried rattlesnake was a bit weird, the rooste was a fun time. I'm not sure how I'd like this place if I wasn't in a large group but for the setting it was fun. If the food was better I'd consider giving the rooste 4 stars but at least it earned a solid 3."}
{"text":"DONT waste your money. 
Inferior beef, inferior service wilted warm salad and zero appeal. What a huge disappointment. The food was TERRIBLE!  The first order was prime rib. It was served swimming in water from the unseasoned frozen vegetables and had absiolutely no flavor. That was exchanged for a piece of meat named as a fillet of beef on the menu. It was the most inferior fillet ever served   YUK! Our guest ordered a medium rare New York strip.  It was served well done. Our guest was too polite to complain. My husbands bone in rib eye was a tasteless overcooked disaster. 
The only edible thing on the table was the cotton  candy.  What a sad experience. I came home and made a fried egg sandwich as I was so hungry. Not worth going  to even for the view.  Zero stars."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are a big country fan, but not if you are looking for a good meal. 
Their food is just not the best, being somewhat tasteless. Also, the service is often slow, almost like an afterthought. All they do for birthdays is a thing of cotton candy- no cake or real dessert. 
On the other hand, the atmosphere is spot-on. It is especially great when they have a band. 
Basically, go here for the ambiance, not the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is stellar at this cowboy steakhoise. A must see for visitors to the Ahwatukee/Tempe/South Phoenix area. From the archetecture to the live bull by the front door, from the huge slide to the live country western music, from the rattlesnake on the menu to the cotton candy, this place is fun for everyone. The views are awesome too. Last night the food was even pretty good. Husband had steak and ribs, tender and tasty. Our visitor had steak and enchiladas which she said were delish. I had a hamburger with fries and fresh onion rings...burger was over cooked but still very good, the rings and fries were the best!!!"}
{"text":"Steak wad decent but not great.had the bone in ribeye.  Also, no starch included so you have to order a side for about $4.  I would go back.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Doing a little staycation at the Arizona Grand so we decided to hit up Rustlers Roost for dinner. We arrived at about 6:30 and had a tough time finding parking sober decided to use valet. It's no charge so it's really a no-brainer. We were seated right away. Server was friendly and food came out pretty quick. I had ribs and steak medallions. Flavor of the ribs was spot on but the cut was awful. A lot of gristle and fat. Steak was incredible. I was disappointed with the sides though. They didn't really give you any options. You get whatever they roll out like it or not. Anything extra and you have to pay. Kid had a burger (a $16 burger!) and it was good. Pricey but good. Wife had fried chicken. It was also pretty good. For dessert we had the cow pie which is ice cream under a chocolate shell. This thing was so frozen solid that we needed to break it apart with a knife to eat it! It was way to big of a dessert! No way a small party could eat it all. We didn't even get halfway through it. All in all dinner was OK but the service was a bit slow and the prices were waaaaay too high for the quality. Drift drinks, dinner and dessert came to $80 with tip. Next time I'll stick with Aunt Chiladas or go off site."}
{"text":"Seriously a valley staple.  You must go at least once!

Brings back old Arizona style.

Food is good.  Excellent steak!

I don't think they do it anymore but they used to cut your tie off if you showed up in one... childhood memory."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a great place to bring friends from somewhere else. 'Cuz Arizonan's will likely find the whole thing a bit over the top. But it's fun, offers live music, and is definitely not your run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. 

As other reviewers have said, the theme is strictly kitschy Old West. At least, what European tourists and Spaghetti Westerns think Old West is."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the steaks here for a while and went in the other night for our usual..a porterhouse and a filet.  Something was off though this time as neither one was as tasty as they usually had been."}
{"text":"Great food reasonably priced. Loud dining area. Poor service.  If you are parents with young, preteen children, you might enjoy this more.  Food was good, but servers were unattentive, hard to find.  There are better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Food is average, not at all a value for the price. My steak had almost no flavor. 
Service was average. The waitress wasn't as friendly as her cowboy hat and boots led me to believe she'd be, nor was she very attentive.

They were mostly able to accommodate my food allergies.  The rice has butter, the corn is pre-buttered and for whatever reason I wasn't able to sub fries for my rice, but whatever.  The steamed veggies I had were good, and obviously way healthier than fries anyway.

But this place earns its two stars based on the fun \"extras\": a slide that our kids loved, a kids menu that doubles as a hat that looks like bull horns, a guy that makes balloon animals, a band (that happened to play some of my fave Willie Nelson & Johnny Cash songs), and a spectacular view (really, all of this is where the money goes when you buy that $15 cheeseburger).

A few final words about the bull at the entrance: Really, the last thing I want to see before I eat a meal of beef is a sad, lonely bull lying in a little pen that stanks of bullshit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to visit.  A must if you are in Phoenix.  The food and ambiance help make this place a destination, not just a place to eat.  High atop Phoenix the view, at night, is incredible.  The food was yummy and not overly greasy.  I tried the fried zucchini and mushrooms and everything tasted fresh.  The fried Chicken was succulent and moist.  The beans were tasty and the corn, perfection!  Everyone in our party loved it so much that we went back a second time during our week long visit.  The people that work here are very nice and really go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience.  The lady that was making balloon hats, etc. made a spectacular Elvis, that was just amazing!  There is a slide for the kids that goes from the second to the first floor, yeah, adults had fun too :)  The live music was well played and fit the venue.  I will go here again whenever I'm back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for date night and I was pretty excited when we were driving up. Parking was easy and we headed in. First thing I noticed when walking up to the entrance was that it smelled like manure. Couldn't figure out why until I saw the cow in the enclosure literally by the front door. I thought it was kind of cool that they had a little friend there but be warned it does smell a little funky walking up. Walking inside, the place is super themed. It kind of reminded me of one the lines of the rides at Disneyland. I thought it was super cute. They had a live band playing below and that added to the restaurant for sure. I had really high hopes for the food here. I ordered a prickly pear margarita to drink and that was good. It wasn't too sweet and was nicely balanced between the prickly pear and tequila flavors.  For dinner, we decided to share Cowboy Stuff, which is made for 2 or more people. It came with ribs, steak kabobs, salmon kabobs, half a chicken, fried breaded jumbo shrimp, fresh veggies, jumbo potato wedges, bbq beans, and corn on the cob. Cowboy Stuff also came with a salad and a basket of bread, which had biscuits and fry bread. The salad was good nothing special. The biscuits and fry bread came with a cinnamon brown sugar butter. The biscuits were not fluffy at all. They were almost like little pucks. The fry bread was my favorite and it was good with the butter. The butter could have used additional cinnamon and sugar because the flavor was very light. I would say the rest of dinner followed that theme of needing more flavor. Everything we had was moist, tender, and falling off the bone, but it seemed like nothing had any seasoning or flavor. There was BBQ sauce that was on the platter for dipping but that sauce lacked flavor as well so that was disappointing.  The beans were gross. I had one bite and that was more than enough. They tasted like they came out of a can and hotdogs were added to it. One of the two things on the platter than I really enjoyed was the breaded and fried shrimp with the cocktail sauce. That was really good and I should have just ordered a plate of the shrimp. Also, I really liked the fresh orange and purple baby carrot. The portion size was huge so that was a great aspect but unfortunately, the food needed some help. 

They have fried rattlesnake and I didn't realize that until after we finished dinner and kind of wish I tried that."}
{"text":"This place is fun and awesome. We had reservations for 6PM, but arrived at 4 for happy hour where we played shuffle board for almost 2 hours before we took our table. Some of the guys in our group even took the slide downstairs to our table. After our waitress took our order a cowboy came to our table and did a few magic tricks for us. Our food was amazing and portions were more than enough. I can not wait to return to Phoenix, because this will be one of my first places to return to."}
{"text":"Although I am very particular about steak decided to give it a try. Wrong idea as the steak was not cooked to order nor was it very flavorful. I have eaten at the Roost since I was a kid and this by far was the worst experience me and my family have ever had. The first problem was the hostesses or rather queen bee at the greeter stand ( not so friendly).  Followed by poor service and steaks that had zero flavor. The beef ribs were  tough and their only  flavor was the nasty excuse of bbq sauce spread on top of them. My wife asked for lime for her iced tea twice and I ended up going to the bar to get it. All in all worst excuse of a steak house ever."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's one of my favorite places in Phoenix to eat. The last trip was great too they were very accommodating to get our big group seated."}
{"text":"This restaurant give me a profound case of chronic eye-blech and the only cure for this is severe eye-rolling.

It makes me feel silly being in here, the corniness of the grounds, down to the \"slide\" into the restaurant and the token longhorn out front.  Its one of those places that you smile at your company and pretend that the BBQ ribs are delicious and not massively fatty as if the steer was fed in the corn varietal Cap'n Crunch.

I feel slightly embarrassed as a Phoenician that THIS is the place they choose to host the participants of the Valley bowl games, as it does not represent the authenticity of the gorgeous valley cuisine.  It's beginner Texas Bar-B-Que, which, if its a style you're unfamiliar with, tastes adequate.  I'm not sure I even saw a pit or a smokehouse on the premises, so in retrospect, I would actually think about sticking with the chicken. 

But there ARE some positives to Rustler's Rooste.  The views are second to none for a Phoenix-area restaurant.  And they serve Shiner Bock on tap, into a mason jar, and down your gullet.  Their happy hour specials seem really good, and you know, when discussing the matter of your middle-aged co-workers in Friday jeans and hair buns, The Rooste's thematics actually works in a charming way.  As a bonus, you actually get to avoid the throngs of MidWesterners and their children during this time of the day.

Overall, this place is a very uncreative knock-off of Cattleman's Steakhouse in Fabens, Texas."}
{"text":"I have been here on three separate occasions.  First, my fiance had some friends that came to visit here, the second time was dinner with a friend and the last time was a company event.  I never left this place impressed and for the dollar, there are a lot better places to visit.

Meal:  I have had the ribs, ribeye, and burger here.  I almost always have a mason jar full of beer!  

Taste:  It isn't that the food is bad, but its expensive for what you pay for it.  I wouldn't grade the quality of the meal any better than say an Applebees or Chilis.  It is medium quality food that has been crafted more towards pleasing simple appetites and a board base instead of really striving for something wonderful.  7 out of 10.

Value: Meal is overpriced given the quality of the meal.  Portions wise, its ok.  But if I am paying for near Ruth's Chris or Flemmings prices, I expect better meals than what I received in the past.  2 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  I have never had bad service here but I haven't had service that really stood out either.  7 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  This is what makes Rusler's Rooste \"Rustler's Rooste.\"  The views of the city are amazing.  Even though I dislike country, the live bands make the experience enjoyable.  And how could I forget the slide?  I do take the slide to the dinning area every time I go.  And those who don't are schmucks!  5 out of 5.

Overall:  I could take it or leave this place.  I am not upset that I got a meal here, but I am not planning my next trip.  I think the only reason I would go back is if a friend or family member from out of town really wanted a different, unique Phoenix dining experience.  But if you are willing to pay an extra $10 per plate for an exceptional meal, I recommend taking that option instead of going to Rustler's Rooste.  20 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was very excited because I had won a gift basket at La Noche de Yelp Elite Event in March for Rustler's Rooste and thought well my mom is coming from Washington for a visit in April why not take her there, it would be a 1st time for the both of us! Sounds like a great plan right!

Mom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her. 

We got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.

Well 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.   

We were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs! Going to have to come back from some more of them!

I have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service, but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts."}
{"text":"Food: It was disgusting! Half of our party couldn't finish our meals. This place is overly priced.
Service: Terrible, I never got my water filled after being there for nearly 2 hours.  It wasn't even busy that night, really disappointed in our waiter.
Oh and apparently bathroom hygiene is something to be glanced over there were hygiene products strewn across the bathroom. The only saving grace is the beautiful view of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I brought my mom for mothers day brunch and had never been. It was a beautiful experience and the server Brennon was amazing... will definitely go back and ask for him!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here forever. Such a fun place to bring guests from out of town. The view is awesome plus you get to eat some wonderful food. They are only open for dinner and are busy every night. They have a live band which can get loud at times so if you have kids ask to be seated away from the band. You need to come here hungry because you get a lot of food. They always Bring out salad, bread and biscuits before your meal. After you dinner they give you cotton candy!!! 

Their prime rib is so good. You are able to choose which size you would like. They offer 4. If you are brave enough, you can have rattlesnake for a appetizer. I still haven't tried that yet."}
{"text":"Due to the fact that each time I am in town on business I get a room at the Arizona Grand, it was only a matter of time before I got to experience Rustler's Rooste.  \"ehh\" is a good way to describe this plae.  When the best part of dinner is the magician who does card tricks, I guess that tells you what you are paying for - it ain't the food.  
We ordered the rattlesnake and zucchini sticks for apps, and they were average.  While we were eating, a funny magician stopped by our table and played a few tricks on us, and it gave us all a laugh and some old school entertainment.  
I had the filet, and it came with, green beans and another side.  I have to say, my dad can cook a better filet than this place.  My steak was very bland, and didn't taste like the steak I was expecting.  Not for the price.  The portions were huge, and the experience was fun because we were in a large group.  Unfortunately, it wasn't due to the food.
The view from the restaurant is amazing!  You look out over the city and out into the mountains, and it is very serrene.  They have live music, and even a slide that gets you down to the restaurant.  It's fun for kids and adults.  So, when the company is paying, take a trip to Rustler's Rooste - you'll be in for a good time."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Phoenix and #1 daughter took us to Rustler's Rooste for Sunday night dinner.  I was not favorably impressed.

The drive to the restaurant after dark is confusing and we got turned around more than once trying to get to the parking lot.  The upper lot with the handicapped spaces is much too cramped, especially when the trolley/bus is there.  A negative.

Having the bull in a pen just outside the front entrance door was a turn-off for me.  Smelling bull s---- before I walked in the door did nothing to whet my appetite.  A real negative.

The stairs are somewhat steep and I felt very vulnerable going down the stairs (no slide for this old lady).  A negative.  We were lucky enough to be seated at a table over looking the city.  The view is spectacular.  That was a positive.

We waited for our server to arrive to take our orders.  We waited for our beverages to arrive.  We waited.  When our entrees were finally delivered to our table, they were put on a tray and left to sit for about 5 minutes before yet another server came to serve us.  It was pretty obvious that the plates had been allowed to sit for more than a minute under the lights in the kitchen, and adding the 5 minutes on the tray made for a steak that was only lukewarm.  A negative.

My filet was tough and had a lot of gristle in it.   A negative. The beans were good, but I can't say I was impressed by the meal.  I took the largest part of my steak home for the next day, and when I got it into good light to slice for a sandwich, I found a thick streak of gristle through the middle, which pretty-much negated the idea of making a decent sandwich.  

We had trouble finding someone to refill beverages, and we didn't see the same server at our table but twice--when she took our order and when she brought our check.  It was somewhat confusing to have to repeat our drink orders every time someone came to the table.  A negative.

My feeling is that a restaurant of this calibre, at the prices they charge, shouldn't have to entertain its patrons with someone who is making balloon animals.  The almost-constant popping of balloons, along with the ambient noise, was a real negative for me.

I've had a better meal at Texas Roadhouse!"}
{"text":"This was a super fun place for our party. Our company rented it out for an event. The entertainment was good. The cowboy show was great, and the costume picture booth was great. Loved the slide into the restaurant. The patio also had a really good view of the city. The food was decent. Your typical BBQ buffet options. Not the best, not the worst. Just pretty good. 

Great job accommodating our party."}
{"text":"We had a really good time. Our food was good, the service was good, our view was perfect. The only drawback was the wait time but it was Valentines...so they get a pass. I've always liked this place and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I loved the Rooste, primarily because my kids had a great time. They cruised down the indoor slide and got an up-close view of the longhorn steer. It was really a nice family experience with a great view of the city. My prime rib was tasty and my wife's steak was just okay, but if you have a family of young kids you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Food is decent. I won't go again because of their reservation policy, where you still wait regardless of whether you have one."}
{"text":"We ate here due to it being so close to the Arizona Grand where we were staying. I had eaten here before, but didn't remember it. Probably not a good sign to start with. When you first check in it is fun for the kids because they get to go down the slide which they loved. They wanted to keep going down it every 5 seconds once we sat down. 

The food and service was just meh. I should have used my better judgement and chose to go somewhere else, but this was a super quick drive. We could have even walked from where we were staying. 

I personally thought it was over priced for the quality of food you get. The portions and big and you do get a lot of food, but it wasn't worth it to me since I didn't love it.

I know my kids loved it, but only for the slide and the cotton candy which was great. I love cotton candy."}
{"text":"I recently visited Rustlers Rooste during a work meeting. Below are my thoughts:

The entrance is gross. I get that it's a gimmick restaurant. But I would prefer not to be greeted by the smell of cow pies when I walk by the entrance. 

The decor was cool. Definitely felt like I was in a ranch style restaurant. 

The food was OK. In my opinion it was a little overpriced for what you were actually getting. My steak was cooked perfectly - which I was really concerned about. The rattlesnake appetizer completely lacked any hint of flavor. The rest of the food was also OK. Nothing terrible, nothing great. 

Overall there are definitely better places in Phoenix to eat. This place might be worth a try - but don't go into it expecting a lot."}
{"text":"Been there, done this. Nice view and prime was good. Sides were meh... not so good. It was just okay. HUGE cotton candy served after dinner, we had 2 brought out for 4 of us... it was actually good too. I wouldn't of ordered it, it was just brought out."}
{"text":"Service was abominably slow. Everything was very basic and boring, cooked without passion. Tried the rattlesnake - it was so breaded and fried that it was hard to tell what it was. Was basically a fried asteroid. Steak was so so. Salad wilted and tired. Wine list poor. Seems to be good for kids and families but don't go here for a \"real\" steak."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little kid.  Loved the slide.  
Went here for a steak and a beer with some old friends after work.  Great views. Not to loud and great service."}
{"text":"Went to RR with a group of 15 and had a great time. The accommodated our group very well and we had great service. The decor was like you were in a western mine and saloon. There is a huge long horn cow out front at the entrance, and when you enter you take a slide down to the lower floor. The food was very good and portions were plentiful. There was live music and Lind dancing which made a great atmosphere. Views from the outside were nice since the restaurant sits atop a hill looking over east Phoenix. If you stay at the Arizona Grand this is a must visit. Oh and it's family friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a call ahead reservation this last Saturday.  It was for 7 pm, we arrived about 10 minutes early, there was only 1 parking spot left, very limited parking.
We checked in and were told it would be about 10 minutes. 
After 35 minutes we went to check on our table, they were still working on it.  Finally about 45 minutes total we were seated, at the very last table buy the exit door in a dimly lit corner next to the kitchen, the seat was awful.
Our food was worse, we ordered baked potatoes and never got them, the salad was drenched in ranch and soggy.  Our food was mediocre, I got prime rib and it was tough and chewy, my husband got ribs and those were good.
Both of us felt sick a few hours later, we were both in the restroom.  I do not recommend this place it was a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Great themed restaurant. You get the whole western experience, longhorn included. Again, we were there for an event, so we pre-ordered the meal, which was fantastic! BBQ and the meat was superb. They provided western themed games and the restaurant screams country. If you need to impress an out-of-towner with a western themed place, this is it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to come here for years and finally try the place but the steaks had no flavor very plain. I definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Fun family place for a large party. Nice cowboy style novelty set up. Great service and ice cold drinks. Food is overpriced for what you get and I wS not impressed with the steak at all. Food was bland and some under cooled and some over cooked."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Been here a few times but we always forget about it since it's not close to home. My husband and I came here for dinner on Wednesday night and we had a great time hanging out and listening to live music. The food was so good, we had a burger, mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything we ordered was delicious, good size servings too. Our server was nice and attentive. The best part about this place is the view at night, the city lights are so pretty and you can see everything with this restaurant being up on a hill. Awesome place to try for something new!"}
{"text":"Any place where I can ride a slide to my table AND get to eat BBQ is already ahead of the game.  Great views of the city, and an overall friendly staff, and an overall enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Obviously, kids loved the slide and cotton candy.  

We strolled in just ahead their rush on Friday night and were seated immediately.  !!!

Bread & butter and salad were good.  Ribs were unremarkable and potato skins weren't great.  

View was beautiful."}
{"text":"We actually came here twice, two nights in a row for different experiences.  First night it was a quiet date night.  Shuttle from nearby hotel was perfect as we were very unfamiliar with the area.  Many choices but we eventually settled on the swordfish and ribeye.  Both cooked to perfection.  More food than we knew what to do with but all of it so very wonderful. Staff friendly and quick.  Noticed near us at a family table there was a guy making balloon animals and one doing magic tricks.  Nice easy shuttle back to our hotel.  Next night we had a very large group of hungry gymnasts.  They had the best time, was so much fun to watch them soak up all the entertainment.  I requested the magician to stop over as well as the balloon guy.  That magician was AMAZING!  Food was wonderful, even the kids enjoyed the rattlesnake and cactus bites.  Fun slide inside that even the adults enjoyed.  The view was pretty, hard to see if you are deeper inside the building but still breathtaking.  Would love to stop again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Large bull outside? Check.
Slide from the main floor to the dining area? Check.
Rattlesnake for dinner? Check.
Cotton Candy for dessert? Check.
Live band? Check.
Excellent view of the valley? Check.

What is not to love!"}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun here! We came here for our anniversary and I was pleasantly surprised. I feel like it's more of an experience than just going out for dinner. There's live music, a slide for the kids and there's an amazing view. The food was good not great. It's a little expensive but I feel like you're paying for the overall experience not just the food. Overall I'd rate the music view and atmosphere a 5, the service a 4 but the food a 3"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review. Ever. But having read other recent posts and especially from the same night we were there, 05/05/18, I feel compelled to agree, not worth the time or money except for the lengthy and lively conversations it provided us for the next 3 days talking about how bad the service was. 6:30 reservations, got there on time, still had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes or so. The add'l bar tab while waiting for the table, must have been a plus for the restaurant's profit margin? Got seated finally, the lighting was so dark that most guests were using cell phone flashlights to read the menu. Kind of comical really that management didn't even seem to notice because the lights remained that dark. The waiter whisked salad plates out like he was dealing a deck of cards reaching across the table for the last few. The premixed salad was floppy and mostly went uneaten. The fry bread was good at least. Drink refills were not offered, had to ask. Requested a wine menu, the waiter said, \"oh that's those cards behind you if you want to grab one\". I think our order did not get entered sequentially because two tables around us were seated, ate, and checked out before we even got our steaks, at 8:10 pm. The view was nice of course, and at least my 11 year old had entertainment in playing on the slide while we waited and waited for our meals to be served. By the time our dinner arrived, two of us did not even touch our food, not hungry any more I guess. I tried contacting management as well, but oddly, the CONTACT US button on the restaurant's website goes to an \"error\" page. I think they really don't want to know what their customers think."}
{"text":"The ambiance and view is a 10. The service is a 9. The food is a 3 and this is only for the bread that comes to the table and salad was not bad. I got the filet mignon and it was a sad unflavored steak.  I have had better at Denny's. ( back in the college days) The veggies that were once frozen and when reheated were mush.  The cowboy beans were ... I have no words. I am kind upset because it was Valentines day .  
They really need to step it up and rethink their menu.  I would hate to see this place close"}
{"text":"If you have kids, this would probably be a great place to go. Very loud with live music and very mediocre food. Good view if you sit by the windows! Cotton candy for dessert was tasty and weird!"}
{"text":"The official slogan for the resturaunt should be \"The food sucks, but at least you can throw yourself off the mountain!\". We ordered all you can eat ribs, frozen margaritas, and a side of ranch fries. The ribs had such little meat and sauce, they'd be perfect for a supermodel trying to keep her figure. The meal comes with a soggy salad, Food City baked beans, and Army Surplus store carrots. The \"fries\" were 4 huge inedible, rubbery pieces of potato dong. We washed it all down with our $10 jars of salty, tequila flavored ice.

Until assisted suicide becomes legal in Arizona, eating here is the next best choice."}
{"text":"This isn't a place you go for great cuisine, it's a place for a celebration, or a family dinner, or going with friends... it's more of an experience... at least in my opinion. And yes, t is pricey.

I was there with friends and we had a great time. We had a window table with a nice view. We got beers, the shrimp cocktail, pork ribs, bone-in ribeye, and swordfish. Definitely skip the swordfish. The entrees come with lots of sides, like bread, beans (so flavorful!), and salad. They bring you cotton candy at the end.

I wouldn't go back here, but it was fun to try once.

Saving Money Protip: I'm not sure if they let you split a meal, but if so, order a meal and add a baked potato (only like $2 more). There is plenty of freaking food for two people with all the sides they bring out!"}
{"text":"Amazing time! We took our 3 kids and the service was exceptional! Magic guy and balloon man were awesome! We haven't been in 10 years and we will definitely go back with kids!"}
{"text":"Good bar food- great atmosphere. Would go back and try other items on menu. I had a salad and a few appetizers."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Took my family of 15 to celebrate a graduation. Our server Bobby did a good job with what he had to work with. However there were too many mistakes to ignore. An entire tray of food was dropped (not Bobby's fault). So when the new tray of food got brought out everyone had their food but me. I literally sat the entire meal watching everyone else eat. My food finally got brought out as everybody was boxing up theirs. So I ended up boxing up mine and taking it home. I will say Bobby was amazing with the drinks. With that many people he was smart and brought out two at a time per person. Also the check was incorrect 4 times. By the time we got done sending the check back because of things that needed to be fixed, it was almost $100 difference. It was embarrassing that I had suggested we go there for a great experience and my parents, who picked up the tab for all 15 of us spent more time making sure the bill was correct then enjoying family time. They tried to compensate with so much dessert, that everyone went home with chocolate cake for days. It really is a good restaurant and we might go back again but never with a party of more then like 4."}
{"text":"They have a steer named Horny. Seriously, a live long horn just chilling outside the restaurant. I am not sure if this is a beef freshness indicator or just for the kids, but it is a cool touch nonetheless. The view of the sunset was fabulous. This place screams rustic wild west while yielding gourmet five star fare. Thank you for a fantastic finale to our work trip."}
{"text":"A 'must-see' for travelers! Ride the slide. Eat snake and steak. Great view!"}
{"text":"An absolute must if here to visit or down for a good time this was my first time and Kevin our waiter made it one to remember. The prim rib was perfect and the view was a great treat. When you walk in your greeted by no other than alive bull. Will definitely come back and will be bringing friends family and guest that visit az."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and enjoyed it.  The music was good, great ambience but a little too dark where we couldn't see our food. The food was good and prices were fair.  We will go back on or next trip to Arizona.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a party and it was a great venue.  The views on the patio are awesome, the live band was good, the slide keeps the kids entertained and the food is at least average.  Not sure its worth going out of you way for just for a regular dinner since the food was nothing spectacular but good enough."}
{"text":"I was astonished how bad the steak was at Rustlers Roost.  I ordered the T-Bone medium rare, a $23.00 steak.  My wife ordered the NY Strip.  Both were very, very poorly prepared.  Neither were finished.

I should have known it was going to be bad when the waitress asked if I wanted A-1 sauce.  

My steak was less than 1/3 inch thick and severely overcooked.  I would have returned it but didn't see the waitress again.  It had absolutely zero seasoning and tasted like cardboard.  I really was wishing I had asked for that A-1 Sauce (which I hate) 

I have had better steaks at the Waffle House.  If you want  a steak, go elsewhere.  A Big Mac would have been a step up from the meal I got at Rustlers Roost.  The restaurant has a nice view but the food is EXTREMELY sub standard.  I will NEVER EVER, EVER dine there again."}
{"text":"We were the Hired Photo Booth Rental at an event on 12.10.16.

We came early, set up and went to the bar to grab a bite to eat before the event.
The staff was Stellar.  They all \"annoyingly :)\" followed the rules and you can clearly tell it is well managed.  We got a mix sampler and as always the food was fantastic.  We had a huge plate of food neither of us could eat half of and it was around 13.00 (i can't remember exactly)

As we worked the event the staff worked seamlessly to put on a huge event for 400 people.  Wasn't the only party there that night.  I was impressed and I recommend big events there!

{"text":"Ok, lets be fair and reasonable here.  Yes it is a tourist place but it is also a fun place to go if you live here.  My daughter turned 35 yesterday and she asked to go there for her family birthday party.  There were six of us and we had a great time.  Were the steaks Flemings quality?  Nope.  Was the salad the best? Nope again.  But the place has one of the most drop dead good views in all of the valley, sawdust floors, a bull outside, and tons of awesome old west atmosphere.  There is even an awesome slide you can take from the upper level to the lower level.   I have been to this place 20 times or so and I am never disappointed. 

People who go here expecting an amazing culinary experience are going to the wrong place.  One look around the Roost -- just being there puts me in a good mood!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, live bull at the entrance enjoyed the slide coming in!  Great view the service was good. Had the New York strip steak cooked to perfection just needed a little more flavor. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting AZ or even local folks. $80"}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food and Great Views!

I have been to The Rooste many times but have never given them the credit they deserve on a site like this. Every time I have visited this restaurant I have always walked out with expectations that have been exceeded. This is a great place to take visiting friends and family so they can get a true \"taste\" of what has been in Arizona for more than 40 years! They do it right! As others have said, this is the place that you go to if you want to have an experience from start to finish with cotton candy to finish... Nicely done Rustler's Rooste, nicely done!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night, and it was quite busy.  It helped that we had a 6 PM reservation.  The hostess seemed stressed and unfriendly, however, we were with her for a matter of 20 seconds for it wasn't a big deal to me.  Don't forget to take the slide down to the dining area!  We were a party of 4 and were seated at a table that was very small!  We had a heck of a time fitting everything and you had to be cautious were your hands and arms reached during the meal.  Over server, Joe, was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  I order \"The Tombstone,\" a margarita with huckleberry juice in it.  It was very tasty, had salt on the rim, and you could taste the tequila.  I recommend it.  The biscuits with cinnamon butter and honey are to die for!  It's their standard bread service along with fry bread.  I had the 16 oz prime rib for dinner.  Salad was served family style first...a little underdressed for my liking.  There was less fat on the prime rib than I expected which was nice.  The au jus added a nice flavor.  I expected a horseradish cream to be served with the prime rib, however, there was just a side of plain horseradish that was enough to clear you sinuses!  The meal would have been a notch up if horseradish cream was served.  The carrot coins came that with it were far overcooked and lacked flavor.  The cowboy beans tasted much more like chili.  The corn on the cob was buttered and juicy, just not in season so I thought a different side would have been more appropriate.  Their menu selection is average.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely request a booth next time!  Take full advantage of the views too!  I would agree with reviews in that food's flavor profile needs work.  Overall, Rustler's Rooste is great for those who enjoy a view with their dinner, but do not expect a huge selection or knock-your-socks-off flavors."}
{"text":"I will NEVER come back here! Amber, the server, was rude and disrespectful from the moment we sat down. I could receive better customer service from a drive thru window. Our order got messed up and rather than finding a solution, she continued to spit out excuses. We received dirty dishes and never got drink refills. If I had not been sitting next to a water container, we would have been thirsty all night. She gave dirty looks after we approached the manager regarding our issues. As we were leaving, she starred our party down while walking out. The food was not the greatest. I would have enjoyed it more if I at least received satisfactory customer service."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of family's where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding.

The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city."}
{"text":"I had fun at Rustler's Roost. I think the atmosphere, the view and the big kid slide made my rating, because the food is just ok. It's a little on the pricey side too, but this place is just super cute- drinks in mason jars and family style dining, and a western theme. I'll go back."}
{"text":"My family and I had an opportunity to dine at the restaurant on Sunday, September 4th. The atmosphere was very inviting and very nostalgic. They had a live band there and people were line dancing. We ordered our meals and the server was very attentive from the beginning but as soon as we received our food she did not come by regularly to clean up the empty plates and she did not ask if we wanted any additional  drinks when are glasses became emptied. The steak was very good as well as the cheeseburgers , but the french fries were not good at all. We ordered the rattlesnake and when we went to the front desk to get the shirt that stated we ate the snake; they only came in a size small so we missed out. We love the book in the feel of the place but I do not think we will go again."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas so I didn't expect this to be very true to the name but I was corrected as soon as I got there. First thing you see when you enter is a big white and brown bull in the bull pen. They start off with a great family style salad, and biscuits with fried Indian bread. I ordered the 10oz Rustlers Cut Steak was amazing. It was very juicy and properly seasoned. The beans they served them with were great as well. One thing that they served that was amazing were the sweet potato fries. These bad boys were sweet and tangy, tasted just like curly fries. The atmosphere is kind of like a dance hall set up. The have a slide you can ride on to get to the second level. Yes a slide. Definitely a great family place to hit up if you are in town."}
{"text":"So you don't go here for the food. The price is for the atmosphere and the view. The food itself is barely average. The chicken was dry. The steak was chewy. The burger was bland. The ribs were the best, but some of them were dry. The fry bed was really good and the honey cinnamon butter was great. My kids really enjoyed the cotton candy at the end and they loved the slide. Was it worth coming once for the experience? Sure. Will I go back? Nope. I can get better food elsewhere for half the price."}
{"text":"We take the family here every time they come to visit.  The atmosphere is perfect for families with young children.  The steaks are great and we love their cotton candy!  Perfect place for work parties too.  We had a great time at our corporate holiday party."}
{"text":"Great cowboy atmosphere, and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"3x is the charm - slide in the resturant, good band, and to top it off, view of the valley as a major thunder & lighting storm rolled in!

Its cliche, its goofy and you drink out of mason jars, but if you are looking for a bit of silly, I really enjoy it - I've been for drinks, with the family & on a date - all times were entertaining & the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Went there with my family to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday.  View is beautiful.  I would give the food 3 stars and service 2 stars.  If you are looking for an interesting place, sure, come.  If you are looking g for a steakhouse and/or great service. Don't come.   

I ordered their top sirloin, medium.  Below is the picture of my steak, from a center cut.  In my mind - Medium rare.   The waiter offered to replace it but by the time he got to me, i had eaten around the edges and didn't want to send it back.   Another gentleman (the manager) came over to offer to replace it and i told him that i didn't trust a chef in a steakhouse who couldn't could a steak medium.  He then told me it WAS medium which blew my mind.   First, even if it was which from the picture it wasn't.   You NEVER tell the customer he is wrong.  You suck it up and move on.  I told him if he really thought it was cooked medium, he needed to goto chef school."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to Easter brunch for a few weeks since we made reservations. I would usually prefer the Hyatt Compass room, but we thought we would try something different for the family and guest. Unfortunately, it was a mistake. We were met with a very long line, after we finally got to the hostess desk we were asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating. We opted for outdoor seating and were lead to a dirty, rickety picnic table in full sun. We asked for shade seating, only to be told they were all reserved. We had not been asked when we made the reservation if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating. Despite all this, as it was very loud inside we thought we would try the outdoor seating, and were told we could move if it became too warm in the full sun in our Sunday best. At first it didn't seem too bad, we went in and got our food, ok selection but some fairly rude servers who would glop food on the plate, not caring where it all went. After about 20 minutes it was becoming too warm in the full sun, we were waiting for a family in the shade to finish and leave. When they had left we asked the server if we could move to that table, since we had been seated in the sun the longest and were quite uncomfortable. To my disbelief the waiter said we could not be moved, as they would surely be seating someone else there shortly. About that time we noticed another waiter helping his already seated table move to the table in the shade. My guest ordered coffee and it was brought to her in a soda cup, with the explanation that they did not have coffee cups. She could not drink it as the glass was too hot to handle. We had made 10:30 reservations in an effort to make sure we would be there early and have better service. As it was too warm to continue to sit in the sun we did not enjoy any further food or dessert, chose to pay the check and leave. The waiter actually had the nerve to complain that he still had 8 hours of his shift left! It may be a kitschy place to dine and have a great view, but do not count on any degree of service to the customer. It was by far the worse dining experience, and very embarrassing for our guest."}
{"text":"A bit of a tourist trap but hey this place is fun and has a great view.  At the entrance you are greeted by a Steer and then walk down a hallway that feels like a mine shaft.  Inside there is a slide for the kids, a large bar area for us adults, a stage for a band down below, and excellent views of Phoenix from the balcony.  

The food here is average but its always fun coming with an out of town-er and ordering rattlesnake for an appetizer.  If I'm with locals, we come here strictly for for a drink out on the balcony or the free happy food that they have from time to time."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Rude, and tasteless. I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude but this place was awful. It's in a beautiful location with gorgeous views. It has a nice western atmosphere and the cow out front is a nice touch. Everything else was miserable. My husband got the steak and enchiladas. He was fairly happy with it. My grandma got some wings and she was happy too. I got the prime rib which tasted awful (and was exceptional chewy) and they paired it with corn and carrots for 23.95 - are you freaking kidding me? Their \"fries\" are way too big and my kids refused to eat them. Their kids mac and cheese is practically easy mac. We splurged and got some rattlesnake as well. We got 5 itty bitty pieces for almost $20. The wait staff was rude to us and the place was uncomfortably packed full of people. I'm sure other people had better experiences but I though this place was quite awful.  I might have been able to write a better review had I not paid over $100 to not enjoy my dinner at all."}
{"text":"Love the view here, especially at night. Lively atmosphere with a live bands most if not all nights! Perfect for out of towners! They have a picture booth, indoor slide, and cotton candy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!

it has an outstanding view of the southern phoenix area and if you go right before sunset you see the beautiful Arizona skies.  definitely double up on the indian fry bread- to die for!!!!!! 

if youre with a big party I would suggest getting the dinner platter it offers TONS of food and actually sits on a tray right next to your table.  very convienent for table space since theyre isn't much at some places to sit

did I mention theres a slide to get to the bottom level, if youre not feeling adventurous you can always take the stairs :)"}
{"text":"Took my better half out this past Friday night and found this restaurant somehow while looking online for somewhere to go.  It was amazing and we enjoyed every moment of it.  We will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"The fried Indian bread and biscuits are to die for! They are served with regular salted butter and cinnamon butter. Watch out, you can fill up FAST on these delicious starters! The swordfish is very good. Got the snake and cactus app, and the cactus was the best.  We sat at the bar for about 30 minutes before our table was ready and the bartenders were very nice and poured a great dirnk."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed..."}
{"text":"The night started out with us arriving right at 6pm (our reservation time), and being stuck in line behind a few other families. The hostess had to keep alternating between talking to customers on the phone through her headset, and serving people in line. Maybe they were understaffed, but she looked like she was used to having to do both jobs at once, which really slowed down the line. Despite making a reservation and only getting to the hostess about 10 minutes later than our reservation time, we still had to wait for another 15 or so minutes, which I found rather unprofessional. However, aside from that, our service was great and experience memorable. 

First, the food. Man, was there a lot of it. We got the rattlesnake and prickly pear appetizer. Probably because it's snake, but the meat was in super small pieces, and I felt like I was just eating a lot of breading that I didn't want. The pieces of meat that were bigger had a chewy texture that I quite liked. The prickly pear tasted strange, in my opinion, but I hear it's not for everybody.

For my entree, I ordered \"Some of this and some of that,\" which included 3 steak medallions (not very big, but definitely enough food) 3 large fried shrimp, corn on the cob, and rice. My steak was cooked perfectly, and the rice was delicious as well. The shrimp was overdone, and there was too much breading for my liking, however. I would recommend getting them grilled instead (or get another side altogether, I'm just partial to shrimp). In addition, we were served a house salad to share, a bowl of \"cowboy beans\" (which were delicious!), 4 pieces of frybread, and 2 biscuits. The frybread and biscuits came with an amazing cinnamon butter, which I highly recommend. We didn't realize that getting leftovers packed up was an option, so we left quite a bit of uneaten food, but we know now for next time! There's also complimentary cotton candy at the end of the night, but we were too full and didn't want any. It looked like some other tables really enjoyed it though! 

Our table wasn't right next to any windows, but I could still enjoy the views from where I sat, which were spectacular. I also got to watch the family next to me celebrate the birthday of their 7 year old little girl. The guy who made her a balloon and chatted with them awhile seemed to really make her day, so that was also cute to see. There was also a live band, that we were seated pretty close to (which I was nervous about), but the volume was just right. 

All in all, it was a good and memorable experience. But now that I've done it, I don't think I need to do it again."}
{"text":"There was an incident that occurred upon arrival that made my party and myself very unhappy, the manager Danny took care of the incident very professional and quick! Sat us to insure we were happy... great customer service provided by Ian (Our Server) and great food! Overall happy with our visit and will be back again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Its been ages since I've been here & it was good to be back - we had a great time on Friday night! Right when you sit down they bring salad, bread& butter, &baked beans, so good! Our whole party got different steaks, they were all good - not the best I've had. I had the 8oz filet with a baked potato and I would definitely get it again. The atmosphere is fun as well, country themed - there's live music, and a bull outside. Also if you make a reservation they normally put you by the window with awesome views of the city."}
{"text":"Our son chose to come here for his birthday dinner.   We got there right before 5 and we were quickly shown to a table.  Our server Brennan O'mara was fantastic!  He was on top of everything the whole night!  Our drinks, food, everything.  Our son had a perfect birthday dinner thanks to Brennan and the rest of the staff.  Thank you for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"Our last visit 06/26/2014 was disappointing. The steak, a rib-eye, was excellent and very tasty, however it ends here. The vegetables, broccolli and carrots, were smothered in peppercorn to the point they were inedible. The fact that no other vegetables were available is mind boggling. The cowboy beans were doused in ketchup. This is unfortunate because in September, 2013, our previous visit, the food was much better. This time we ended up only eating the steaks. Shame!"}
{"text":"Boy, where to start. If you are from the Denver area this can be compared to a steakhouse version of Casa Bonita. No cliff divers here, but you will find a bull, complete with smell at the entrance, a slide going from the main level down to the dining level, a live band and a dance floor that may or may not be flooded with a Sweet 16 party. The only thing this place is missing is a mechanical bull, which would definitely bump it up to four stars and guarantee repeat business from me. 

The food is average. We were brought biscuits and fry bread with two different types of butter. I found the biscuits to be too dry, but the fry bread was good. I mean, it's basically a donut, how can you not like it. I ordered checken with bbq sauce and a baked potato. All of their vegetables are pre-made and soaked in butter and the only salad dressing available without dairy was oil and vinegar. So, maybe not the best option if you are allergic to dairy or lactose intolerant. They bring a gigantic bucket of what tasted like bubblegum flavored cotton candy at the end of the meal. None of us asked about dessert, so I am no help there, sorry.

The service, live music and the view were the best parts of this establishment. Our server had been working there 26 years and was so kind and helpful in making sure nothing I ate had dairy. They also have a bus that will take you back to your hotel, even if it is not close! So go ahead and have that top shelf margarita and cut a rug!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty great here. Went with my bf, his parents,  sister, and nephew.  It was a lot of fun. I love my boot glass! Reminds me of the one I had when I travled to Texas with my family growing up. The food was decent. Location awesome.  I'm so glad we went here for dinner!!! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Looking for Friendly hostesses, live music, great BBQ, good environment, and a little bit of fun while having dinner, try this place out. Located near the Arizona Grand Resort. Great view in the evening when the sun starts to set (if sitting outside or near the window). Free wifi for your pleasure but plenty of entertainment in store. Video games are present and shuffle board available to play. Indoor and outdoor settings. Two story Restaraunt with lots of fun. 

First time at this location but Food was ok for my family tonight. I personally loved my half-a-rack ribs with carrots, jalapeño bacon Mac n cheese, with corn on the cob (definitely a must). It fell off all the bones and that's the greatest test for any ribs. That speaks volume in itself. Great flavor and epic BBQ sauce. Zucchini logs were really great as well. Had a taste of the Salmon and it was coked perfectly and tender but flavor needed a little work. Like it was missing some butter or lemon. It was still good to me. Big Burger was good. Coconut shrimp was a great size portion but seemed a little over cooked. Seasoning was perfect and brown rice was great. 

Overall experience for me allowed me to give this location a 3-star for the live entertainment, fall-off-the-bone ribs, the outside view (location), and friendly hospitality."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks with a view, primarily the desert sunset. The view was minimal and definitely not worth the antics or crowd. Had a drink and ran for the hills (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"Okay I have been coming here on and off for five years.My kids remember the atmosphere and what was awesome food and great steaks. Wait a minute did I say great steaks.?

What the heck has happened.?The last two times I have been here since a few years ago have really changed things. I could not even cut my steak. Neither could my son who travelled all the way from Montana to revisit his memories of the roost.

And c'mon guys no cotton candy for the kiddies on the Fourth of July. Well I paid for the steak but won't be spending any money here for a long long time."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy the views from this hilltop location!"}
{"text":"It's true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70's. 

I can't say much about the food since I've only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff.

Pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the rib eye steak, rare, yes it was! I ordered the prime rib-very good. Biscuits & fried bread with cinnamon butter, vege and cowboy beans, good meal for the price.  Country western music was giving us the atmosphere we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Waited 60 mins for a table even though many tables sat vacant.  Even if they were waiting for a reservation, there was plenty of time to feed us before the reserved group showed up.   In the meantime, the  waitress we had at the bar had a melt down  after dropping  a tray of drinks--as a result, she never came back to the table. Only after threatening to leave were we given drinks and shown to a table. The steak was so tough you couldnt cut it with a fork, the Salmon was extremely fishy, and everything else was average and nothing special...band avg as well. Wasted three hours of my life I'll never get back.  Additionally, get ready for parents who love to use this place as a day care service...screaming kids running around unsupervised everywhere.   Seriously? Why do so many people come here?"}
{"text":"Place has 3 stars and thats pushing it.  Good atmosphere,  but im thinking the cooks are enjoying it while their cooking.  Hands down worst steak in my life.  Apple bees would be a better option!"}
{"text":"Had our first bad experience at Rustler's on Father's Day and it was a rough one. We had a reservation for 430 and were seated right away and ordered appetizers. All the appetizers came out quickly and were delicious as usual, however, we waited close to 40 minutes for any other food to come to our table, and noticed that no one else seemed to be getting food either. When the food finally did come out we had: 2 cold steaks, 1 set of lukewarm ribs and congealed mac and cheese. That was half our table. The food was cold enough that I could feed it to the 10 month old straight away without cooling it down. We sent one steak back, and it still came back semi warm. When the manager came over to talk to us about it he did offer to take things back again, but at that point we were over it and wanted to have dinner as a family. He said he'd take the kids meals and 20% off the bill. Our bill came and he had taken a total of $20 off. Not much of a dent in a bill that was $280 anyway. It was so disappointing for a Father's Day dinner. On the positive, our waitress was nice and apologetic for the wait on food."}
{"text":"We scheduled a wedding rehearsal dinner banquet.  I've been coming here for years and it is always been an enjoyable experience.  

While the staff was WONDERFUL, the food was mediocre at best and OMG THE COST!  I wasn't provided a banquet menu until it was too late to cancel the reservation without losing our $ 500 deposit. Convenient.

We did appetizers and soft drinks (not even any alcohol!) - over $ 1200 for 30 people!  We could've gone somewhere else and had a very nice dinner for that price.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to bring people from out of town. I called in ahead of time to reserve table, and the lady was very friendly, explained everything to me over the phone. The day of the reservation i got another call confirming the reservation.  

I had a table for 10, including visitors from California, Wisconsin and Australia. We all had an enjoyable time, and our Server I think his name was Brennan was amazing and he was training another server, and that did not effect the speed of order taking and food delivery. Great Job. 

Food was a bit bland, but that is okay, we all had different dishes, and i did not take many pictures but  the highlight of the evening was the rattlesnake appetizer with cactus fries. The dish looked interesting, we all got to try some, I would say may be have a little more sneak and less fries, but it tasted OK. We were not sure what to expect and when we got it, the batter was so heavy i hardly got any meat on my bite. any way, the experience was great. Waters were filled constantly and Brennan asked us multiple times if we needed more drinks and if there was anything else we needed. 

We ordered other appetizers (Nachos, and Onion Rings) and everyone really really enjoyed the nachos. The onion rings were a bit soggy.

As for my dish, I ordered the big burger with sauteed mushrooms, and that dish was amazing. Burger was cooked to order, and I really enjoyed every bite of it. Thanks to your team for a great experience and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Ugh... Why do people keep dragging me here? When eighty percent of your menu is fried food, and it all comes out dry or over breaded, you've got a problem. And those big bad steaks they serve are so underwhelmingly boring that it's a joke. And that \"spectacular\" view isn't even that good! Nothing compared to the view at Compass Grill, which is pretty close to the same price. Goodness. One star for the only good things I've tried so far, the free bread and free cotton candy, and another star for having a slide. I'm sick of this place."}
{"text":"A fun place for cowboy food. They have a bull, and a slide, and the restaurant at the top of a mountain offers great Valley views. Sometimes mixed quality, but still a 4 Star place."}
{"text":"Been here several time ok place unless you come alone then they refuse to sit you ... Place is EMPTY but if you are by yourself it's the bar or a 30 minute wait what a crock of bull !!! Extremely dissatisfied with the service and their behavior !

Other then that nice view but the hostess sucks !!!
May not be back after this trip just because of the service ....

Really disappointed"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. By far the worst service and the food was sub par. The restaurant was not busy and our waiter never came back for refills, to check on our order, dessert, or how we liked our food. We tried to address our concerns and the manager was less than empathetic.  I would not go here unless my life depended on it. And I'm sure I would be disappointed then too."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice and beautiful view. Waite staff was nice and attentive. I gave 2 stars based on that alone. My sister, brother-in-law, my fiancé and myself all had the fillet mignon; we all agree it had no flavor. My sister likes her steak cooked well; hers came burnt on one side and red on the other! My fiancé's food was supposed to be medium and was pink on one side and well on the other. Mine was supposed to be pink throughout and was not pink at all. My niece and her kids did enjoy their food. 
One had cajun steak and the kids had the kids steak and mac n cheese which was ok!    Each meal comes with a piece of corn on the cob, veg of the day, a bowl of baked beans to share and family style salad to share as well as dinner rolls. Unfortunately we were not impressed."}
{"text":"It was a fun time. I came with a large group, which it appears a bunch of people do. The view was fantastic and the kitch-i-ness of it all was pretty fun. When from out of town, it's not every day you get to try rattlesnake or prickly pear cactus!

That said, the service was pretty poor and the family style food was just not very good at all. I remember most of it being pretty bland and dry. 

Fun for an adventure of, \"hey! You're in Arizona. Here's some rattlesnake! There's a bull! Go down this slide!\" Not much else."}
{"text":"My wife and I went went here for dinner  09-10-15 and Wont be Back...from the minute we walked in it went down hill ..and this was a Thursday night..We were seated right away and had a nice view .....Then ...Crickets.....It took forever for our waitress and when she did show up she acted put out it wasnt even crowded took forever to get drinks ,food took even longer , Ill Cut to the the Chase  ..Management needs to kick it up quite a bit the wait staff appears to be very young and more interested in talking among themselves than providing service. Its a shame as it is a great property but I guess they believe they continue on due to bus loads of tourists that are overwhelmed By Being in AZ and the view and Not knowing they are getting served sub par food and service. The new Rawhide is way Better and not very far from this place..
Get your managers inline and staff then work on the food..."}
{"text":"Amazing place to have dinner while visiting Arizona. The country feeling is great, amazing view and good food. 

The restaurant almost has the feeling of a Disneyland attention from FrontierLand!!! Good for the family and perfect for tourists looking for landmarks and a good spot to take pictures and enjoy some local food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago because my fiance and I were feeling nostalgic. We both loved this place when we were younger. Well, now that I am an adult, I finally understand why no one ever wanted to go to Rustlers Rooste but me. This is not the kind of place that you go to for the food. This should be a drinks only stop. The food was below average and took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. We ordered our steaks medium, they came out lukewarm and bloody. Nachos were generic, tasted like they had been microwaved to melt the cheese. Several tables around us made complaints and sent their food back. I will say that their saving grace is their fry bread, drinks and view. After \"dinner\" we were able to take our beers outside on the patio and watch the sunset. It was beautiful to see the valley from the top of the hill so at least the night was not a total waste."}
{"text":"We decided to visit while in pheonix with the kids. While many consider it a bit touristy it didn't feel that way. View was amazing and being greeted by the large Bull was unique and memorable. The wait was only a few minutes. The food was decent and a bit overpriced but worth considering all the other things: slide, saw dust on floor, magician, live music. Our kids will remember it for ever I can assure you. That's what is all about."}
{"text":"Ok. So. There are lots of poor reviews and a few outstanding reviews. I've been Elite for a couple years. Been to a few 5* restaurants and a few minus* restaurants. I frankly rate this place a 3*.

When you consider the history of the place (on their literature) it used to be a den of robbers, literally. The place is there for the fun & novelty factor. Def not for its culinary delights. 

The parking lot is large. The place seats almost 500. They have a live steer right next to the outside front door and he does what bovines do. But hes a novelty and lets face it people, most people have never seen a real, live cow/steer. I'm sure he doesnt have the most exciting life and I'm sure if the Arizona humane society thought it was inhumane they would make the place rehome \"Horney\". Yes, thats his name! 

When you walk in you'll be greeted by loud, live country music and some nice Hostesses. The place looks all 2x4 exposed wood beams and beer signs. The stories you've read about are true. There is a metal slide that you can ride down instead of taking the stairs to the lower level main dining area. Ride at your own risk especially if you're wearing shorts! Its a fast short ride with a carpeted landing. The Hostess waited patiently while my whole crew went down. I thought better of it and took the stairs. 

We were shown to our table down next to the windows. The area has a delightful view of the city and was a nice backdrop. Btw, we made reservations and were seated promptly. There seemed to be a large adult birthday party going on and the \"Happy Birthday to You\" was sung with gusto and a loud dinner triangle. 

The kids menus are standard and written on the back of a cute set of horns that you can put on your kids head. Mac & cheese, chicken fingers, etc for $5-8 dollars. Our Waiter Josh gave us good service. He explained the specials and was attentive to our requests. I ordered the Prime Rib Special $24 which was about a 8-10oz cut with a half corn, long grain rice and 3 shrimp. There was au juice and horseradish on the side. Josh also brought out bread with butter & cinnamon butter, a large bowl of mixed green salad and a small pot of Busch's baked beans. My friends ordered the beef ribs. So here's my critique. We didnt go to Morton's or Ruth Cris Steakhouse.  We went to the Rustlers Rooste. Lets consider & keep that in mind people. The buns were decent but the butters were tasty. The salad did indeed have a generous helping of ranch dressing applied but I would not say it was doused and limp. The iceberg  lettuce was crunchy and there were a decent amount of cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices & croutons on it.  We received our meals fairly quickly even with how full the place appeared. My Prime Rib was very rare and barely hot. The corn looked like standard costco boiled and my long grain rice was chewy. The horseradish was very full bodied and the au juice tasted like an oxo cube dissolved in warm water. The beef ribs looked decent. There seemed to be an ample amount of meat on each rib. It came with the half corn cob and boiled carrots. The carrots tasted bland and kinda chewy. My friends reported the ribs tasted decent. Afterwards they were given a nice warm washcloth with lemon squeezed overtop to wash their BBQ sauce fingers. Nice touch. Better than a dry shredded napkin. The kids ordered mac & cheese which came with garlic bread and the chicken strips which came with french fries. The portions were surprisingly large and we took home a large doggy bag. There was nothing special about the kids meals at all. But thats not necessarily bad. 

At the end of the meal Josh came back with a cotton candy in a coffee tin can for the table to share. We politely declined cuz of the hour of night. Also, we chose not to order their deserts either. So I cant speak to that. I didnt use the restroom so I cant speak to that. Sorry about that. 

They have a little Rustlers Rooste gift shop downstairs tucked away by the restrooms and they had t-shirts with Horney the Steer and another with a reference to eating their rattlesnake entree. They had kids small figurine horsies, shooter glasses shaped like a boot, hats and you could buy the button-up American flag shirts that the wait staff were wearing. I purchased a t-shirt and it was about $17. 

So, all in all, our experience was pleasant, Josh gave us good service, the food was not overly impressive but we figured \"what the heck, we'll go there for the fun\".

That, friends, is how you need to broach this place. Simply for its entertainment value. Period."}
{"text":"So, I've lived in the valley since 1996 and I just had my first visit to the Rooste. My friends were in town staying at the resort, they invited me out, so up the hill we went. 
First impression-stinky cow by the front door...? Yuck! Our wait was about 5 min. Not bad (it was a Thur, around 8). Our table was great, the view of Phoenix was awesome. 

As for the food... first they bring out a basket of strange little flatbread things that weren't very warm. Almost like hockey pucks. Then out comes a salad with wilted iceberg lettuce that is covered in ranch dressing. Not great either. 

Everyone at the table ordered steak. My friend said her tenderloin was really good but I didn't taste it. I ordered the sirloin, it tasted good, it was tender, but it was just barely warm. It was obviously sitting in a warmer, and I would have liked a fresh cooked steak better.  The meal came with green beans, which I didn't even taste because they looked awful, and corn on the cob which looked like the little frozen cobs you get at the grocery store. The best part of my meal was the baked potato. It was delicious. 
We ordered a kids meal sirloin and the steak was cold and tough.The kids burger was decent. 

Now, the end of the meal was the strangest thing I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The busboy comes and motions to us to hand him our plates. He proceeds to dump ALL our food into the salad bowl, utensils included!! It looked just plain nasty. SO weird. 

Now that we are finishing up, the THREE kids are asking about the cotton candy they keep seeing go by. I tell our server we will take 3. She says \"you only get one.\" I say \"well, then we will purchase 2 extra.\"  She says \"you can't buy extra\" I'm like fine whatever. I'm all about kids sharing, but you're out to a nice dinner.. maybe a special occasion.. give each kid a cotton candy for cryin out loud. 

Then you leave and pass the stinky cow again. Fun. If I was staying at the Grand, I'd pass on this place and hit the Claim Jumper down Baseline...."}
{"text":"We went into the dinner with somewhat low expectations. We had heard the food was mediocre and that it was touristy but realistically we were tourists and wanted a casual meal. The atmosphere was not bad. The decor was overall cheesy but not terrible.  Live music was a nice touch and the outdoor area was the best part of the place on a nice night with a great view. Food was okay, our steaks were cooked well, nothing blew us away culinarily but we weren't completely disappointed. My largest complaint would be the service. I would say my three stars are for food and atmosphere. Service was awful and warrants zero stars. Our waitress, Brianna, greeted us with a \"hey\" and before we even indicated that we were interested in more than drinking she set down a bowl of salad and a huge basket of bread (which was way too much bread for two people) then walked away. We later overheard another server explaining the homemade dressing, biscuits, fried bread and the different butter to her table. Our server did not give us that information, probably because she was way more interested in her bartender coworker. She stayed at the bar chatting with him while another employee set our food on a tray in front of our table. That employee abruptly walked away while we just starred at our covered food for 7 minutes until Brianna came back. When she did come back she didn't even acknowledge that we had been waiting for our food while she was socializing. Maybe we did just get the one bad server or one bad night but it definitely affected our entire experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food and entertaining. Great city view. Servers were very friendly!!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Having dinner out for the first Thanksgiving of my life couldn't have been better.  As crowded as they were the drinks were served quickly and the food was served hot and delicious.  The wait staff was friendly and  attentive and we had a great time.  Such a beautiful view too.  Thank you Rustler's Rooste for making it a very Happy Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"The view was great and getting there wasn't too difficult.  We got there right when it opened so there wasn't a wait and we got a good seat. There's a fair amount of kitsch here with the slide down to the main level and the over-the-top cowboy theme from the wait staff, decor, and even the menu, but that's what they're about!

The food is pretty good quality.  You get the salad, biscuits/fry bread, beans, and then your main dish.  I had the ribs/filet medallions and the medallions were pretty good.  The ribs were overcooked and the sauce was a little sweet.  My friend had the bone-in ribeye and it was cooked properly and had great taste!  I'll have to lean toward the steak next time.  Staff was really good about recommendations, having a great attitude, and clearing the table.  The cotton candy was a nice finish to give you a good attitude as you left.  Definitely a good place for out-of-towners!"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in our experience. My wife ordered a sirloin, medium rare. It came out medium to medium well. She tried to eat it but it was so tough she had to send it back. The waitress asked if she would like the filet instead. It took 30-45 minutes for her meal to come back out.  The rest of us were finished eating already.  When it came out it was closer to medium  than medium rare. Very underseasoned and bland. And still so tough she only ate a couple of bites.  I ordered the prime rib. It was cooked to order but almost 1/3 of the piece was fat and grissle that couldn't be eaten.  It, too, was bland and not seasoned and so tough I had trouble cutting it with the provided steak knife.  Our waitress checked back with us about 10 minutes after she delivered our order, then we didn't see her again for about 45 minutes when she brought my wife's replacement meal. We had to ask for water, she didn't offer to refill it.  We asked for our check and waited about 20 minutes to get it. Once we put our bills down for her to pick up we waited another 10-15 minutes for her to even pick them up.  We paid full price for our meal. There was never an offer to comp my wife's meal.  This was definitely NOT a $140 meal.  We won't be returning and I strongly suggest you find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I like Rustler's Rooste. It is for meat eaters only. That is why I do not go there much, but it is by the point in Ahwatukee and close. The views are the best in town. The bartenders are nice. It is very much set up for tourists. It has what I call, \"A tourist propaganda story,\" about it being a rustlers cabin in the old West and the slide is for the rustlers when they fled the law. The tourist eat it up. Actually it was build, I believe, in 1976. Tourists come in from the bus load. The Japanese tourist men are especially funny thinking this is the real West. Portions are generous, and usually there is a happy hr."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute blast!  
We were staying at the Arizona Grand so we were dropped off and picked up by the shuttle from the resort.  Very Convenient! 

Walking up there is a Huge Bull who's name is Horney! Fitting as he has two HUGE horns...  hehe. ;) The smell was less than appetizing, but then again it brought me back to the country a bit..  And well that is the theme of this place.  We got over it as we walked in! 
The Restaurant is decked out Country!  
We all enjoyed entering the Restaurant on the slide, YES I enjoyed entering the Restaurant on the slide!  I would have kept going, as all the children were doing, but I was reminded that we were in a restaurant so I acted appropriately (aside from the first slide where I literally shrieked with pleasure!!.) My daughter did suffer a bit of rug burn, but she got over it! 

So we sat down and ordered our food-  the girls ordered Spaghetti and Macaroni (I did remind them we were in a Country restaurant and they could have BBQ!? But they were in the mood for pasta, ok!) Their portions were very generous! 

Boyfriend and I shared the dinner for two, which came with a bunch of options.  Ribs, BBQ Chicken, Shrimp, Swordfish, potatoes, cole slaw (served in half a pineapple), beef kabob, etc... you get the picture? It was A LOT of food.  $21.00 per person but it was a LOT of food. Tons of Leftovers!  

OH did I mention that we ordered the Rattlesnake App?  We did, it was delish.  They are cooked kind of like pop corn chicken with a chipotle sauce.  And they deliver it with part of the snake bones for \"show\".  It was good, we would order it again. 

It was Khaira's bday so they gave us an option of dessert, they serve cotton candy so we stuck with that.  It was a great way to end dinner!  

They also had a live band playing, which was great for a week night! It was a very fun experience.
Beer in a mason jar, and a fantastic view! 

The best part was that we happened to show up on kids eat free night- so the girls' meals were FREE!!!  Nice surprise!!   

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I was disappointed with this experience as we have been here multiple times with great experiences tho.
This time was different we were told to go to the bar and wait, we both saw 2+ sections open and empty. We asked 3 Times to close out the one beer from the bar with no bill until we said we we're leaving.
The manger did come up and escorted us to a table. The food was basic at the best, the prime rib we both ordered was so fatty over half we had to discard. Normally the prime rib is amazing. 
We left disappointed and date night a bust. Prob won't return nor recommend friends."}
{"text":"Felony animal abuse is condoned here. No, I'm not talking about the steak they serve, I'm referring to the cow out front. I was there Monday night at 6:30 with my in-laws and when I took my son to visit the cow there was a pack of boys hurtling rocks at it while the parking lot attendant watched with a sick smile on his face. I yelled at them to stop and THEN the attendant came over. I asked him what was wrong with him? Why didn't he stop them? And he replied \"there's nothing wrong with ME - there's something wrong with YOU - you're yelling at kids.\"  Huh, ok. My father-in-law is an officer with the Tempe police department so I went and asked his opinion - turns out pelting defenseless caged animals with rocks is considered felony abuse, but yelling at kids to stop hurting it? Nope, that's just human decency.  

Yes, the view is great, but this place with its shady staff, long waits and mediocre food does NOT deserve your hard earned money."}
{"text":"3 for atmosphere and 1 for food. The view was really good, and the slide was really fun with the kids. Live band was ok and the bull was meh.. The food was absolutely horrible everything tasted pre made or microwaved it was really really bad I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Good food. Fun place for the Easter holiday with the entire family. There was a brunch buffet with lots to choose from. Tried just about everything. The ham and roast beef were excellent. All the breakfast stuff was good and the egg diablo was interesting. Never had that before and it was a bit spicy but had a nice flavor. 
The desserts were not so good. A bit dry, frozen, cold or tasteless. 
The bathrooms were small and not so clean. 

Overall, not good or bad but average. Thought it could be better for such a place and price."}
{"text":"An interesting place to go. Cowboy theme all the way here! 
Beautiful settings around the structures around the outside of the restaurant. 
They have a smelly bull outside that looks cute and pointy.
The entrance has quite an incline when you get inside.
There is an option to go down the slide but it is mobbed by kids going down it and then climbing right back up the stairs. You will have to stake your claim because that line is fierce! :) 

The prime rib was good and the Melon Margarita was better then good.
The Beef Nachos were AWESOME. I would get that for my meal and not miss a thing.
The band that was playing was a great older country band that had people dancing. It was a relaxing country, not the put on stuff. Not that I'm a country fan but there is a difference from the country on crack(pop?) music and the older style. 

They have a very talented balloon guy that makes great swords, motorcycles, hats... etc.. for kids, for free.

LOUD. VERY loud.  Lots of people, lots of kids!  Good place to take a group, call ahead.

Cotton candy is served at the end whether you order it or not. It is free and I even tried some even though I swore I wouldn't. 

TLDR: Novelty spot.  LOUD. Worth the visit to try once to see if it is your thing.  MUST try the Shredded beef Nachos. I'm a fan of the Melon Margarita. The entrance has a steep incline when you go inside."}
{"text":"This is a fun, affordable, kid friendly restaurant! I've read some negative reviews on food quality but I felt it was good for the price point. It's not fine dining but it's good food. We went during a visit to the AZ Grand hotel and walked out at $50 with 2- cocktails and having fed 4 kids, amazing! Kids eat free in the summer and you can't beat that! The slide, music and complimentary cotton candy make this a great experience for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is pretty much beast! It's original and fun and it has a beautiful view over the city of Phoenix! The food was pretty good I give the food about a 3 and a half but I was more intrigued by the atmosphere. I mean they had rattlesnake on the menu for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! They also have a balloon guy who walks around and makes balloon figures and stuff; well get this, he made me a shotgun and it gets even better, he made my friend a mini toilet. Another cool thing is that it is like inside a mountain and they have a live band. The kids will love it! They also have a slide down to the restaurant area for the kids! All around fun! They also have a bull in front of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. 

My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \"good old days\" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.

Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  

But!  You also get a cowboy hat.

I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).

As for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.

For the meal, I had the \"catch of the day\" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  

But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? 

Probably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns."}
{"text":"Oh man.. well overpriced drinks, and small portions (including on drinks) makes me laugh. One person in my party got crown on the rocks, i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses.  RIP OFF!

The view is good (not great), the bull is real. the servers are good people, the atmosphere is typical for a steak place. That is where my positive experience ends.

While scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix, it was nice to see all the \"mountains\" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah. not really mountains to me). Back to the important part everyone...the food. They were greatly overpriced...well my first thought was okay priced high food must be great!...hmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed, well they need to give a bunch of refunds. 

The burgers my friend got, looked dry and zero character. It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburger..you know that dry fake looking one. Obviously the burger wasn't that huge, but it looked lame. The pork chop was also VERY dry. Like yeah, i know we are in arizona and most things are dry, but leave the food out of it. It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it. Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible. I got the prime rib. OH YEAH! well thats what i thought. Horse radish was old, lost its pizzazz and kick. They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone.. and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot.. booo). Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money. The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob, and a skimpy helping of green beans.

And just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me.. Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse.. I've had SOO much better before. It was lacking in all areas of its life.


Want to know where you can go and get better food, same ambiance, and decent service (but no view of phx)...Texas Roadhouse...yeah i said it..i am bringing a chain into the discussion.. I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of here.

End of the line 1 star because the food was blech! 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good service...yup two stars...(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one.. HA)"}
{"text":"We were staying at the nearby Arizona Grand Resort and wanted something close. Be prepared for a very noisy, family style restaurant. Very average prime rib, tasteless bread, mediocre baked potato, don't bother with the carrots. On the other hand, the service was excellent, and the hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was very good. But overall, not a great experience. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Very eventful and fun!  The rattlesnake plate was really good... they could of added another pile in because  it was so tasty! Rolls ehhhhh  roadhouse  is better lol BUT you don't go for the rolls.  Kids had a BLAST and we had a nice view off the patio of the lighting  that night.  Woud Def go again but more for an event they have or holiday  or with out if town visitors.  The dancing  was cute but blocked a small bathroom (3 stalls)  which their was only 2 of and the place is HUGE ! That kinda was crappy  especially  because my 2 year old and j were waiting for a stall in a cramped bathroom with a bunch of drunk ladies..... NOT COOL!  Go for the rattlesnake stay for Horney  the Bull!"}
{"text":"1st time here, drinks were good and they had alcohol yes ppl alcohol, usually you order a drink and you only get a tad of alcohol and these drinks were well served ++ for them, the food portions are big, yes I did feel it lacked a little bit of salt but overall it was good, my nephew said the rattle snake was good tasted like chicken, interesting that it came with fries.. nopal fries I liked the cotton candy at the end that just made my day!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely fun for the kids.  Place is unique.  Steak was good but I enjoyed the views more.  (Both of the city and my bf!  Lol).  They have rattle snake on the menu but didn't try it."}
{"text":"The food here is a solid 3.  But I'm giving them a 5 because of the following reasons: fried rattlesnake appetizer, an actual working slide from 2nd to 1st floor (how cool is that!), friendly staff, kids eat free, an absolutely huge steer by the entrance (you'd have to pay $5 at the OC fair to see this), and free cotton candy for the kids."}
{"text":"You drive up and toss the keys to the valet while experiencing the heady mouth-watering aroma of cooking meat.

Then as you walk up the trail to the front door your nose is assaulted with the other kind of meat: alive and pooping in a pen. Dang, that  bull had the biggest antlers I've ever seen - oh, like I know what  you call those pointy things. Upon entering you're offered a choice: stairs or slide. The 11 kids in our party uniformly opted for the slide. Over and over and over again. So did most of the moms. The 2 dads and one boyfriend all stuck with the stairs.

The family style pork ribs were great. And can I have two of those delish Margies, rocks with salt, plskthx? Nummers.

The establishment itself was gracious to the point of absurdity. We had a 5.30pm reservation for a party of 22. Due to bad traffic, getting lost, missing turns, and just general bad planning, half of us were 45 minutes late. On Valentine's Day, no less! And we were the early ones! The other half of us arrived another hour later. Half of those in our party were girls between the ages of 6 and 14 and no one batted an eye. (And yes, now you all know how pitiful my life is that I spent Valentine's Day with a giant group of kids.)

The band was excellent. The dancing was fun to watch but I'd never participate due to my 17 left feet. The only thing I'd change were the gray mealy beans.

Great place to greet then eat your meat."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for people to visit from out of town.  The rattlesnake was worth a try and everyone got a kick out of it.  I went with the salmon and it was average.  Others have fried chicken and burgers.  All were good.  Service was average.  The view alone is worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Get a table near the window at sunset. Priceless. We love taking out of town guests to the Rooste. Order the rattlesnake appetizer for a unique treat.  If you are going to take a large group, call ahead for a reservation (request the window view). You HAVE to slide down the slide, yes, i said slide! you can take the stairs, but I think all first timers to the Rooste should be required to slide. Great cowboy atmosphere, live band most nights. Love this place."}
{"text":"I rarely ever write a negative yelp review, but this one needed to be done. We went on a Thursday at 5 pm thinking it would be easier because it wouldn't be as busy, boy were we wrong. First my wife attempted to ask the hostess if we could have a seat by the window, but before she could even get the words out of her mouth the hostess was already barking orders and yelling table numbers. 
Next we sat for about 15 minutes without even being spoken to by anyone. When I finally caught a waitress's eye she told me our server would be there shortly. It was at least another 5 minutes before our server arrived and she in no way acknowledged that we had been waiting for so long. She took our drink as started to leave and we let her know that we were ready (as I said it had been a while) and she got visibly irritated that we wanted to go ahead and order. For the entire night we seemed to be an irritation.
When our food finally got there it was depressingly bad. We both ordered our steaks medium rear and they were brown all the way through. When we sent them back the manager came out with the replacements and asked us to go ahead and cut into them. Mine was obviously medium well and he says \"Yeah, that looks better.\" I told him it was close enough and choked it down. No seasoning, no flavor, not worth the price. 
They've obviously decided to become a one stop tourist trap and are ok with poor quality and terrible service knowing that you're probably not coming back anyway."}
{"text":"Rattlesnake was alright because it was breaded and fried. Sorta tasted like fried calamari. Husband ordered the prime rib which was perfectly seasoned and he'd give it 5 stars. Fun place for all ages. Live music, indoor slide for playing, country dancing going on and lots of birthday celebrations. I would go back but pass on the snake but I would bring my grandkids."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was pretty good.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The potato skins and nachos were like the ones at TGIF's or BJ's.  The ribs and prime rib were delicious.  My burger was huge and I was only able to eat half.  The fried bread and cinnamon butter were so good (I had to stop myself after eating two of them to save my stomach).  The strawberry frozen margarita was so good!  Highly recommend it on a hot Phoenix day.  

The views of this place were awesome.  The live entertainment (band decked out in cowboy hats, etc.) was great.  There was a dance floor where people were twirling around with their kids.  The kids can slide down a metal slide to the bottom floor, which is really cool.  There was a balloon man who was efficient in making flowers, elmo, spiderman and princesses.  This is a GREAT place for kids.  Kids eat free as long as one adult orders with them.   Also, there was a longhorn in the front of the restaurant and you get blue cotton candy at the end of your meal (like Alexander's Steakhouse!).  

Great place!  Would come back!"}
{"text":"We had a big family get together and came here, all 16 of us, 8 being kids under 12. We had a great evening of visiting and being together in a fun western atmosphere. Appreciated that the wait staff accommodated our reservation and placed us at a big table by the slide so the kids could play, which they enjoyed.  The fellow who did the balloon art for the kids was great and had their full attention and was kind to our kids. The service was slow but we were a big group so...food was okay but not the excellence they mentioned on the menu.  Had ribs and sides served with it.  Had ribs and rib meat was tender but drowned in BBQ sauce, corn was soggy and sticky from being over-cooked and then cooled and rewarmed, carrots were-bland no flavor or seasoning.  We waited too long to order but the atmosphere and being together outweighed so I didn't mind waiting.  Will come again because it's a fun place to bring guests but I hope the food improves--it could really be much better and then I would give it more stars."}
{"text":"AWFUL! To call this a steakhouse is laughable. Best I can say is mediocre over priced nursing home food. Staff approached us as if we were lucky to be there. Went with pre teens, too noisy to chat and not a one in my party enjoyed their food. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The food is way overpriced and honestly tastes awful (especially the cowboy beans), but I rated this place 4 stars because of the experience that comes with dining here. There's a live bull out front and it's an awesome view of Phoenix. It's a casual and upbeat place with a live band, a slide, fountains, rocking chairs and a dance floor. It has a Western feel to it and is a happy place to be. I would wear comfy shoes if I were you."}
{"text":"Three stars mostly because of the view and decor. SUPPER touristy place. Nothing wrong with that but the food was meh. My wife and I shared the big sampler plate. A few of the items where good, most where over cooked."}
{"text":"Excellent experience again. The manager, Teresa G., was very attentive, friendly and courteous. She really exceeded our expectations. Our server, Keven, knew the menu and was also very attentive to our party's dining needs. The appetizers, drinks, and entrees were great."}
{"text":"Friends have tried to get us to eat here in the past but we never really took much interest until we had family visiting from out of town. We made reservations for 6pm on a Friday night and I'm glad we did. The place filled up pretty quick. 

The kids enjoyed looking at the bull outside and going on the slide the entire night. 

The service was great! However the food was okay. Just ok. Nothing to write home about. We tried the rattlesnake, potato skin, ribeye, jumbo shrimp, salad, burgers, salmon, ribs and steak combo and something else. The servings were big enough for sharing and service was top notch, kids had a blast but other than that I doubt we will be back. The food just wasn't too impressive for us to return."}
{"text":"You know it aint gonna be no good if you see buses of tourists being herded in the place. Well, i was not \"Disappointed\" - Food was blah, drinks were overdone and service was just average. Apple pie was good, but that is about all. 
Only good for outtatown tourists."}
{"text":"\"Subpar food surrounded by a great atmosphere\". 

Ate there with my girlfriend last night after we finally went to find out what was the lit up place on top of the hill was. 

Very cool setting, gorgeous view and looked to be promising but the food was pretty disappointing. 
My girlfriend ordered fried chicken, which even though was plentiful, was also terribly over cooked and dry. I ordered a sirloin that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't like. I don't know if I've ever had a rare steak with so little flavor ever before. I expected so much more from a place such as this. 

I brought up our displeasure and management gave us 1/2 off on our bill. I was ok with that at first but in hindsight it was hardly good enough and I feel it was quickly offered in order to diffuse any arguments in a very busy dining room. 
I don't see us going back again."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is a novelty.  It brings us to a place of folklore and makes us want to brand something and sing by a campfire.  The fare is overall \"ehh\". I go out of my way to bring people like Shawn M there for two reasons.  First - Great View!  Second -  the cornball notion that I might actually get one of my guests to eat its featured rattlesnake!  
To be clear, I have not taken a bite of the snake...nor will I.  But it would be neat to see one of my guests order it.

This place is pricey for what it is, but the servers were kind and there was enough to listen to and dance to.  It is family friendly but not on the pocket but... you wont leave hungry and you'll really feel like you accomplished something since you need to enter just past a caged steer of some sort that seems to have been captured there for some time."}
{"text":"Classic Cowboy food (i.e. Steak) and a great view of the Valley. 

Be sure you \"eat the snake!\""}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the space - it is huge and there is outside seating so if you are dining with kids, they have room to roam. Other than that - ewww. We had a party of 14, all of the steaks ordered were under cooked and had to be sent back. When the steaks came out the second time they were burnt on the outside and still raw on the inside. The service was very slow, they brought one of the teens food from the childrens menu when he ordered from the regular menu and to top it all off the bathroom (and I can only speak for the women's bathroom) was disgusting - the trashcan was literally overflowing. I understand that this is a kitchy kind of 'western' place and wasn't expecting Mortons or The Palm but still . . . yech."}
{"text":"I visited this place on the recommendation of a co-worker.  I love steak so the opportunity to have a nice steak sounded good.  He also recommended I get the rattlesnake app, but I didn't have the stomach to try it.

I didn't end up getting an appetizer, but the bread was nice.  The basket includes biscuits and fry bread.  The fry bread was definitely the highlight and was quite good with the cinnamon butter.  The biscuits were solid and better with the honey that was at the table.

Soon my entree arrived.  I ordered the sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak also came with carrots and corn on the cob.  I didn't try the carrots, but they looked fine.  The corn was good.  The steak was okay.  The cook on it was fine, but it could have used more seasoning.  Just a little bland.  What I struggled a bit with was the mashed potatoes.  I like mashed potatoes.  Just potatoes in general.  Maybe it was in the gravy, or maybe they put it in their potatoes, but there were onions in mashed potatoes.  That threw the flavor all off.  Couldn't really taste the gravy or the potatoes.  Just onion.  I didn't care for it and didn't finish.

The server, Brooklyn, was super nice and attentive.  Nothing bad to say about her.  The view was spectacular!  I was sat next to a window and got to look out and enjoy all during my meal.

Not a bad place at all.  Just to my taste, I wish it was better."}
{"text":"Service was just ok. My daughters both ordered filets cooked medium one came out good the other rare. We sent it back only to get a burnt steak back.  Salad tastes like a packaged salad and the dressing had no flavor. So disappointed! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Was my son's birthday and they did and amazing job, everyone was so nice and the food portions were huge and really great. The bread and biscuits were good and salad was pretty cool too. Then my son's birthday cake slice was so huge but I can say it was great experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Rustlers Rooste but I guess wanting to like something and the reality of it are to different things. Any way, the food was terrible in the fact that it was over cooked (especially the fries). I ordered the Rattlesnake starter as I had never eaten s snake before so wanted to try it, unfortunately, there was barely any snake meat in the dish! It was all batter with tiny pieces (and I mean tiny) of meat! Absolute rip off if you ask me. Anyway, other than the food, the service was just awful! It took 30 mins to get drinks, we were all constantly asking for refills as he would only bring half the table drinks. 

At the end of the meal, which had us all exhausted from waiting around, it took 20 minuets to give us our bills, and when he did, they were wrong! After another 15 minuets, he finally came back cards! 

On a positive note, Rustlers Rooste is beautifully located high up with give fantastic views of the Valley, but other than this, it's just terrible! 

Good luck."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the western theme, the view of Phoenix, and the great service. My swordfish was cooked perfectly, and the portion size was generous. Also, the prices were reasonable. Arrive early to beat the crowds."}
{"text":"This place must've been awesome in its day. I hear there's quite a view but giant parties of 20 stopped from being able to enjoy drinks outside. A group of six and we ordered potato skins, quesadillas, sliders, zucchini/fried mushrooms, nachos, and wings. The people who ate the mushrooms said they were okay at best and left many in the taco shell it was delivered in. I tried to enjoy a fried zucchini but the batter fell off leaving a limo mushy vegetable in my hand. Nachos-there were about a dozen or so chips smothered in congealed cheeses. Skins were the best plate on the table. Wings were good if you e had really good wings but weren't cooked long enough to have a crisp skin so definitely request that if you order. There were quesadillas left over because the meat 'tasted weird' the others said who split one leaving all the other pieces on the plate.
Service was great full star for that.
Skins were decent full star for that.

All the food made my stomach a bit off just a few hours later which is why I felt the need to write this review. Be picky.

Parking is tight-ambiance is strange because it wants that ranch feel but it plays off as dated instead. The lanterns on the table are awkward in the bar area because the tables are so small. 

There's a bull in a pen when you approach the front door named horney and it looked bored and trapped which didn't help lift my spirits about my birthday celebration.

Strange little place with a lot of potential for updates to add more seating and perhaps help by reconstructing the entrance to the building so it won't be so steep would be a great improvement. I hear there's a slide somewhere in there too."}
{"text":"The food and  the service have really gone downhill. I had the worst prime rib and my date had the worst steak that we have ever eaten. This used to be a staple for all my out-of-town guests but I would likely not come here again. The band was so loud that we could hardly talk even on the other side of the restaurant. The waitstaff was not attentive. The atmosphere is always nice but the poor quality of the food was not worth the price and not with a return visit."}
{"text":"Location is amazing for sunset dinners, awesome view of the Phoenix and surrounding areas. The feel of the place is cowboy and really fun, family friendly place with a live band, a slide, and a great place to bring your family. We ordered a prime rib and the cowboy dinner for two with lots of meat! The bread was great but the meat wasn't. All of our meat was over cooked and dry. Which was highly disappointing. Maybe it was the night that we chose to go, but as of right now it is not a place that I am aching to come back to. Our waitress was fantastic, she was cheerful and on top of everything.

Now, as for the bull that they keep in a tiny pin out front...not so great. Although it brings in attention, I don't think that it's a great place to keep an animal that size in."}
{"text":"Food wasnt bad but uber overpriced, and very touristy place!

I had rattlesnake deep friend and a steak. 

I would not go back due to the high prices, but they are not catering to locals, just to snowbirds...

View was pretty nice!"}
{"text":"Not so much. The Rattle Snake was the only hit of the night and they only give you a smidgen at best."}
{"text":"Got here right at 5, 2nd party in line and told a 30 minute wait (very rudely may I add). Then they sat us at a table that barely sits 8 and we had 11. They had the exact same table behind us with 8 and they were tight and tried telling us it sat 11. When I asked for an extra table I was met with frustration and attitude. Sorry, didn't know I was causing you frustration by driving 45 minutes out of my way, spending our money and bringing family from out of town. If you don't want to work here, quit, don't take it out on us. We just wanted to come enjoy the scenery and eat. But I promise you, this will be the LAST time ever. Too bad, great location and good idea. Maybe new management or someone who cares?"}
{"text":"Good fry bread.  I actually preferred it over the corn muffins that were also in the bread basket.  Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about.  Price-y menu for little young me who wouldn't be able to eat enough food to justify the pricetag.  

I'd say the best thing about this place is the view!  The resort has other restaurants with better-tasting meals, so try the happy hour here, but grab lunch and dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Highly over-priced, but a great place to take out-of-town visitors if you are rich. 
Great atmosphere and view (at night when you can see the lights and not the smog).
Went there for a work party and got salmon. Small portion size and ok flavor.
Not a place I would go if I was getting the bill.
Could be intimate and romantic given the proper seating."}
{"text":"Wow, this dull theme park of a restaurant is horrible. Kids would love it, but the prices are way too high for a family. They have a big longhorn steer in a corral near the front door, so the entrance smells like cow pies. Not appetizing! 

We were seated right by a door that kids were shrieking in and out of, and the hostess refused our request to move to a nearby clean, empty table. The waiter was fine, but the food was completely disappointing -- nothing was seasoned. The salad and fry bread were OK, but the sauteed shrimp had not seen any salt, pepper, herbs, anything. They tasted boiled actually. it came with rice mixed with mushrooms, celery and green beans, no salt or flavor in that either. My colleague's bone-in rib-eye, ordered medium-rare, was chewy and bland. I guess we should have been on alert when the waiter placed the bottle of steak sauce on the table first. Why wouldn't they at least salt a nice steak? 

Prices for their tasteless entrees were high, from $25 to $35. This place is awful. Even if you go expecting Western fun and music, you should at least get a great meal for the price. Not here."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday and I ordered the baby back pork ribs.  The ribs tasted old and were very dry like they had been in a freezer for awhile.  I was completely turned off with my meal."}
{"text":"FIRST time and LAST time. Went in for my daughter's 18th Birthday- party of 5- you might think after telling the waitress it was her birthday that she might actually wish her one.. nope:( 
Food was warm at best and none of our steaks came cooked as ordered. Waitress was too busy to come back and check on our meals- bring steak sauce and more bread  ( ask asked for) or refill drinks. Also I would've liked some paper napkins on the tables for all of the fat I needed to dispose of that came  with my Prime Rib. But.... if you like bagged salad- carrots and corn that tastes frozen.. beans that are overly sauced and over cooked steak- you might love this restaurant. Nothing has any flavor! The quality of food for the $$$ price tag was ridiculous as stated by many other reviews here. On a positive note, 2 people in our party ordered the burgers and said they were great! That poor bull covered in flies on the way in... the smell of poop does a lot for the appetite- NOT! 
Manager took 20% off of the bill and did acknowledge that the steaks looked over cooked. Worst experience!
SO SO sad that owner/management doesn't care enough to respond to any of these reviews...."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a company dinner and was extremely disappointed in the food. The bread that they give you when you first get there was really good. The cinnamon butter was a nice touch to it. Next came the salad and the salad was awesome. They have a home ranch that is awesome. I ordered the New York strip and it was the driest most disgusting steak I've ever had. We had 5 others that ordered the same thing and 4 felt the same way. There was no seasoning so we drenched it in A1. The reason it's not a one star is because the waiter and service was very good. The experience inside is fun as well. It's children friendly and even has a slide inside to entertain them."}
{"text":"Great place for a top of Phoenix view! Enter by way of stairs or a sliding board! Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent entertainment, excellent view. Just exceptional in every way."}
{"text":"THE place to take out of town guests for the Cowboy Steak House experience!
Super friendly staff, kids pet the real bull in the pen out front, as well as slide down the 2 story indoor slide.  Best sunset view from the outdoor patio that you can find, entire valley lights up and you can see it all from here.  Steak, ribs, shrimp all very good here, not tourist food.  Been coming here for 20 years and its still #1 on our list to bring our visitors."}
{"text":"Meh.  The fantastic views make up for the mediocre food, but only just.  Most of the meat at our table had been over cooked, and did not justify the somewhat exaggerated prices.  Try the (expensive) rattlesnake with prickly pear fries.  That was about the best highlight."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the worst!!!

Parking is a disaster. We had to walk uphill just to get to the front door. 

No one came to get us when our 14 person reservation was ready.

No one told us our reservations were outside in the fucking barn.

There were flies and the smell of cow shit everywhere.

We didnt get bread until 15mins AFTER we sat down. 

We didnt get salad until 25mins AFTER the bread.

We didnt get drinks until 10mins AFTER the salad.

We didnt get silverware until just before the food came.

ALL THE SILVERWARE WAS DIRTY. Dried food and dust particles were caked on the silverware.

When the food did come, the steaks were undercooked, the turkey was overcooked, the gravy was salted so much it burned.

We are NEVER EVER coming back. The service was terrible, the management didnt care, the atmosphere was god awful. Would give no stars if possible."}
{"text":"The service was fine. ALL of our food was cold. , not even hot enough to melt butter on the baked potato. Paid for the appetizer and and drinks then left. Was worth a try. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is expensive and the food isn't that great, but what they lack in flavor they make up for in personality, especially if you're bringing someone from out of town. It's got a cowboy atmosphere, a slide to get to your table, all that jazz. We started with the rattlesnake (very fried) and prickly pear fries, which were bland, but had a flavorful chipotle ranch dipping sauce. Next I ordered the chicken, which was not good, but it came with corn on the cob and cowboy beans, which were tasty. Decent drink selection and you get cotton candy for dessert."}
{"text":"Really fun restaurant! Very family friendly. The food was good. I have the veggie burger and that was surprisingly good. They give you cotton candy for dessert. They had live music. The view was very pretty."}
{"text":"Considering we had a group of 10, I was impressed by the service and how quickly the food came out,  but that is about all this place had going for it.  It is so incredibly loud you had to yell for people to hear you.  It was so dark we had our phone flashlights out to read the menu.  My steak and enchiladas were horrible.  The sauce looked more like gravy that had a skin on it,  and the medium steak wad so overdone it was black.  Several people in group had the ribs that also said they were too overdone,  ribs should be falling off the bone.  Definitely will never come here again or will not recommend it."}
{"text":"Fry bread....uh do I really want deep fried bread and biscuits with my salad and dinner  NO!!!..the entire meal was not good.  Our sever was nice and took care of us."}
{"text":"Worst place we've been to in a long time. Would not even give one star. Was told a 45 minute wait but wasn't seated for 1.5 hrs! Continued to ask and was always told, \"only a few minutes\". Was walking to be seated and there was kids running everywhere. We had to walk down the stairs by the slide to go to our table and one kid tripped and was almost stepped on and another child pushed me oitnof the way. Finally was seated and our waiter otook ten minutes to get our drink order and we received our salads before our drinks! The food was AWEFUL! I am no food snob but my chicken was dry. Oh and if you like your meal decided for you, this is the place unless you want to pay up. Your entree comes only wit sweat potatoes, gross, steamed vegetables, from a frozen veggie bag, and corn on the cob that has been sitting all day in water. Barf. Meanwhile, 2.5 hrs later we were free of that place with a fat bill overy $100. Ridiculous and I'm still hungry. Don't waste your time and money. P.s. views not that great anyways."}
{"text":"Kind of like Disneyland (Frontierland actually)  The prices are pretty low for the food described, but the quality and prep is mediocre at best.  Stuck at the AZ Grand Resort for a family wedding and avoiding the rehearsal dinner by saying I arrived too late.  Naughty me - maybe this is my punishment.
Well, it's not that bad, but I would only come here for a birthday party for a child under 10, or when I'm a captive audience, like now.  We tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries.  Definitely the highlight of the night.  Prime rib was cooked as ordered, but the meat was awfully chewy.  Sides included:
Biscuits and fry bread with butter and spiced butter:  only had it one other time, but this definitely didn't measure, and the biscuits were not very good
Green salad:  Fresh greens, but flavorless dressing and very little of it
Green beans:  Overcooked, but tasted as if they were fresh
Corn on the cob:  Watery, soggy
Baked beans:  Pretty good, but very small quantity
Baked yams:  Fresh, and well prepared, unfortunately, I'm not a yam fan
Service was very artificially friendly.

Everyone raved about the view, but I was unimpressed with the lights of Phoenix.  I think I'm jaded.

Food:  20/40
Service:  15/20
intang.Atm:  14/20
Value:  16/20
Overall:  65= D+= 2 stars"}
{"text":"Had out of town guests who loved the ambiance and portion sizes. Was definitely a hit. Had the swordfish, it was tender and tasty.  Family style salad was crisp, and cornbread a nice touch. Moderate  prices, live band, great view. Cowboy theme non dressy"}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a good place to go once at least once because of the novelty of being a restaurant on the top of a mountain. The view is beautiful. It is a neat place. I mean they have a bull out front at the entrance. Once you get in there is a slide or stairs. You can choose which you prefer to get down to the first level. They have live bands. They are usually older bands playing country music. They start you off with bread and it is delicious. The food on the other hand was decent but maybe not worth the price. It's fun to try once but the novelty quickly wears off. Parking somewhat sucks. Hope you don't have a hard type getting up stairs because you have to go up about 3 stories of stairs just to get from the parking to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I didn't take in the full effect of this place, but I definitely would like to go back and do that. This was my first experience, and the first thing you notice is the amazing view. Being on a mountain, it provided great views of the city, over looked a golf course and was even nicer once the stars were out.

It definitely had the Old West feel. Walking to the entrance I smelled and noticed the large bull outside. Ahhh Smells like Ohio...at least the part of Ohio I used to hang out in...Going into the restaurant felt like a mine shaft. Wood all around, except for the large jagged rock jutting from the wall on the left and walking up a rather steep inclined ramp. When I emerged at the top, it was really cool. I felt like I was in Paint Your Wagon...the bartender was very cool and pointed out they have free happy hour buffet apps until 6. They had potato skins, veggies and a guy was in the process of changing out ribs for little chimis...He gave me a few ribs before taking them away.

Once my friend showed up, we grabbed a table that provided a good view. The drinks kept coming, and we ordered the appetizer sample that included somewhat rather skinny chicken wings, nachos, and fried mushrooms. 

The downstairs had people in the steakhouse...and the steak smelled wonderful! Upstairs in the bar was basically just me and my friend. The waitress came around about every 5 minutes because she had nothing else to do. Not good to be that dead on a Friday night. She ended up getting to go home early because it was so quiet.

What would I do next time? Try the steak. As I said, it smelled great. Try the fried rattlesnake...never had it and I would rather bite one than have one bite me...try that big-ass slide that went from upstairs to downstairs...and after several drinks maybe join in the line dancing downstairs with the live band. 

I had a good time here, but there were definitely more to be had. I will give it another go-round in the future."}
{"text":"We went for my mothers 60th bday.  I called ahead requesting to leave a surprise cake and make a reservation and was told all would be handled.  I dropped the cake off ahead of time, explained it was a surprise cake for my reservation & gave her my name.

We arrived and was told there was still a 15 minute wait (which was pretty disappointing since I made a reservation) and then was told a reservation only cuts your wait time in half (which is still a little annoying but would've been nice to know when I made it) 

Anyway, in my opinion the food wasn't very good for how expensive it was.  I barely ate any of it.  Then when It came time to do the cake, my waiter (who we rarely saw) did not bring out my cake that I brought and when I explained I had a specific cake he seemed annoyed that he had to go back.  

Cons: Food was poorly cooked and overpriced & service was very disappointing.

Pros: the balloon guy was awesome!! Very friendly my kids loved him! Band was good. And the view is amazing."}
{"text":"The snake was so slathered in breading it could have been caterpillar for all we knew. I've had better ribs at McDonalds. The big bowl of salad was so wilted the manure encased cow out front wouldn't have eaten it. My friend's chicken breast was the size of sperm whale's breast and tasted like it was petrified. The best food was the cotton candy."}
{"text":"A unique atmosphere tucked away in the hustle and bustle of Phoenix. A unique menu and southern roots is on tap at the Rooste. The fried cactus is awesome with the fried rattlesnake. The prime rib was very good. Next time I come up I'm trying the all you can eat beef ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the 3rd annual Grooves Hooves and BarBQ event held by by the owners of Aunt Chilada's and Rustlers Rooste. What a fun event. Live music, several bars. Indoor or out door seating and great food. They roasted several pigs and also offered beef ribs. All the usual corn beans and bread etc. Staff was great, the facility is lots of fun and everyone had a great time. Hoping they do it again next year."}
{"text":"My Family really likes this place great food good service, but this year for Thanksgiving the wait was a little long but to be expected since we could not get a  reservations in advance, but the food  was not up to the standards that we are used to which was very disappointed, the staff was great and very apologetic since they were hearing that from a lot of people. I will still recommend this place to people but not for Thanksgiving when they only have a limited menu"}
{"text":"So while paying a visit to my company's Phoenix office I was taken here because its a tradition. I loved the view of the mountains and the skyline. I like the band playing a mix of country and Jimmy Buffet.  

The food was just ok. The table gets a salad, iceberg smothered in ranch and a basket of bread.  I ordered a bone in ribeye. I normally order medium my first time at a new place and the medium was well done. I really enjoyed the sweat potato fries, but the order is big enough for the table and the one next to you. The cotten candy at the end was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Great value.  So much food.  My husband and I split a full rack of ribs and my kids each had a kids cheeseburger.  We took home a fully doggy bag of food.  Beautiful views!"}
{"text":"Dinner, we were so excited to try Rustlers Rooste. A country style steak and chop house up on the hill. A perfect vantage point to watch fireworks! But despite all the hype, it was just so so. Dissatisfied and disappointed with just everything (who likes mushy carrots and corn?),  Mac and cheese was bland but the Prime Rib and the smoked chicken were Delicious. 
Our server was sweet, the band was good, enjoyed the fry bread and we watched fireworks all across the Valley! Not a total loss. 
If you go, stick to the beef and chicken!"}
{"text":"In the last couple of weeks we've visited Rustler's Rooste twice.  The first time we went was with a group of ten for Happy Hour.  It was a great place to go.  We had great seats with views of Phoenix.

The service was good and so was the food.

The second time we went was a little over a week later.  It was our anniversary and we were anxious to try the steaks.  Again, the service was good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  Our only wish was that they had been seasoned. 

We ended up at a window seat with a group of 7 or 8 at the table next to us.  It was obvious they were in the area from out of town and on business.  How did we know?  Each one tried to talk over the other and we couldn't help hearing every conversation they had.  Obviously, we moved.

Rustler's Rooste is a unique place to visit.  We love the decor and the view.  We also liked going down the slide.  The first time we did and the second time a family had several kids that thought it was a toy to go over and over again. 

Oh well, we would go back."}
{"text":"It is a bit pricey for being a barbeque restaurant. The food is good but it's not great.  if you're going there you're going for the experience not the food."}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere this place has! It focuses on one thing (meat) and does it very well. Started with the loaded potato skins (yum) and also tried the included house salad, which was pretty good. Had the NY Strip, medium, and it was cooked properly and plenty flavorful. The food, plus a nice view overlooking Phoenix, was hard to beat and makes the price well worth it!"}
{"text":"We were sorely disappointed with our meal at Rustler's Rooste, especially considering we had a less than delightful experience the last time we were here.  The food is not freshly prepared. The bread was hard as a rock!  The kids hamburgers were hard as a rock!  For the price you'd think the food would at least be decent.  Nope.  The quality has really gone down and as a result we won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Very well located with a fabulous view of Phoenix, AZ, this real cow boy booth is an excellent place for a party or a birthday celebration. The place is huge, like a multilevel barn, so avoid high heels. Better to come here with your jeans and boots. A group of staff, dressed as cowboys entertain the children too. The steaks are served with generous side plates of mash, beens and corn. I ordered my rustler's cut medium rare and it was well done. It was good but a bit dry. You can find decent wines in addition to the local brew."}
{"text":"Went here for Thanksgiving. It was a cool place to go, the kids loved it, and the views you couldn't beat. I would say the food is lack luster, the staff isn't on the same page. When we called we asked if we could sub out sides due to medical reasons, was told yes with out issue, that was wrong. Luckily we had a great server who took care of me after explaining my medical issue. The food you got a lot of it, but it was just \"eh\". If it wasn't for the server I would have rated it a one star. 

For tourist and people that want a little \"tourist\" spot, its great, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We always have a wonderful dining experience.  In February we attended a private party and it was great. There was plenty of food and the banquet staff were professional and efficient.  The view is amazing and we enjoyed being on the patio. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I've been to Rustler's Rooste on a number of occasions but was recently here on Saturday for a birthday dinner for a 3 year old. We had reservations so there was no wait. I did notice that throughout the night, there was a little wait but did not see that anyone was irritated. The slide was a big hit for our birthday boy and he even danced to a few songs the band was playing. The lighting in our area was pretty low so it was kind of hard to look through the menu, but I already knew what I wanted to order. Our waitress was nice and our drinks were always full. I ordered the prime rib and it was ok. I had to trim alot of fat off but the meat itself was good. The au jus was tasty although a little salty. I ordered the mashed potatoes but didn't care too much for it. It was bland, very chunky & the gravy didn't help much. Since we were celebrating a birthday, my friend ordered the birthday package. The staff came over to sing Happy Birthday with a cake and later on, we heard the band singing Happy birthday with his name inserted, so that was cool."}
{"text":"Arrived couple minutes before 5pm but the hostess still seated me near the window with an amazing view. My server came by soon to take my order, which I already knew exactly what I wanted - prickly pear juice (alcoholic) and the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries. For the drink, you get to choose to have it frozen or on the rocks, with sugar or salt.

She came back with some bread, and butter - regular butter and cinnamon butter. I loved the cinnamon butter, in fact, it's the first place that I have been to that offers it! The bread is more on the oily side, don't think it was perfect to start a meal but it tasted decent. What I didn't like, was that there was no butter knife. I had to use a steak knife to spread my butter on the bread. 

My drink came shortly and it tasted amazing. Sweet, but amazing. Then my food arrived about 10 minutes after. Massive portion I have to say, I was only able to finish about 60%. Both the snake and the fries were deep fried, not your McDonalds fried food, but your KFC fried food with a extra layer of breading then fried again. The fries were..interested. I kind of liked the weird texture it had. I could honestly barely taste the rattlesnake since it was so deeply buried in the thick breading. I bite into one in half to observe the meat - it was definitely a tiny piece, which explains why I couldn't compare it to other meat since it was hard to tell the texture and the flavour.

I asked my lovely server about the rattlesnakes and why/where it is offered. She said it's almost like a delicacy, they have their rattlesnakes delivered from Texas, and in fact, they are the only store that sells them in Phoenix. I can imagine many tourists in Phoenix visiting Rustler's simply for this dish, yet it is priced reasonable. Really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"If you like good food and a great ambiance, do NOT come here. This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life. It is an overpriced tourist trap with subpar food. They handed me my drink in a glass that wasn't washed thoroughly because all I could taste was soap. Then everything I ate was beyond horrible: the biscuits were cold and dry, the $18 rattlesnake bites were beyond overcooked and they give you less than a handful, the \"salad\" is lettuce and bland ranch, the filet was cold and everything else was either over salted or completely bland. They could not pay me to eat here and if it wasn't full of tourists it would've gone out of business years ago."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with your family. They have pretty standard, average food, and lots of gimmicks.  First, the place is huge. It is two stories, and each floor has a bar. Downstairs, they also have a little stage where a live band plays and there's a dance floor. After you are seated, you are given a basket of complimentary fry bread and biscuits, which are pretty delicious. They have lots of choices on the menu, so even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. That being said, there's lots of meat and potato type dishes. You get a family-style premade salad with your meal which is a pretty standard lettuce/tomato/onion/crouton/ranch salad. Ours was cold and the lettuce was crisp so I really liked it.  The portion sizes are pretty generous. We ended up not being able to finish our meals.  We had a couple of cocktails from the bar, and they have alcohol versions of limeade which are pretty delicious and reasonably priced, for alcohol. When you get the check, you will receive a complimentary spool of cotton candy.  The restaurant sits up on a hill, so it has pretty good views of the valley and if you get there at the right time, you'll see a nice sunset.  I wasn't expecting anything truly extraordinary from this place, because I had read the reviews beforehand, but we went, it was packed, we had pretty decent service and decent food so I have no complaints.  If you're expecting a fancy schmancy steakhouse, this is not your place. It is a family-friendly, loud, casual joint which I think a lot of people would get a kick out of.  Oh! Also. If you are staying at the Arizona grand resort, there is a shuttle which will run you up to the restaurant and will pick you up after. That was a great convenience."}
{"text":"The bartender acted like she had better places to be. I tried to keep my sunny disposition but it was a challenge. The cocktail waitress was a lot friendlier until we had a mixup about my order. That put me on her bad side quickly, but she eventually warmed  back up--a little.

The food was salty for some items & dry for others. I will happily spend money for good food. However $100+ for mediocre chicken wings? I can think of much better ways to blow my money."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this establishment.

The positives:
The view from my table was really cool.
The overall atmosphere wasn't bad.

The negatives:
The food.
-The steak was very average. it didn't have much of a char sear on it. It was not very tender, and the flavor was very, what I like to call, supermarket. It didn't taste like it was seasoned at ALL.
Maybe I am spoiled.  I lived in Dayton, OH for 19 years, and am used to eating steak at a top 3 steak house in the US, The Pine Club.  
The presentation didn't help.  I wish I had taken some pictures. The steak was on a HUGE white plate, with some green beans thrown on it.  Very boring, plain, and unappetizing.
I will not be going back. I hope to find a good, solid, non-chain steakhouse soon."}
{"text":"Service was great location is awesome. Food is a no go!! Don't eat here steak was served raw potatoes tasted instant, ribs were tasteless. Service again was great super nice."}
{"text":"We've been to Rustler's Rooste three times. It's a fun place with a great country music atmosphere. However, don't expect them to cook your $30 steak  correctly. After TWO 12 oz ribeyes cooked well done when it was ordered Medium we had to ask for the manager. The manager says it's shadowy in here & probably looks more pink in the kitchen. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! And by the way... customer service SUCKS! It has sucked all three times we've been."}
{"text":"Took the family for the thanksgiving dinner. You could order off the menu but we opted to order the complete Thanksgiving feast. The food was really very good, the turkey was moist and the sides were good. Service was terrific and the view from the patio was wonderful!! I would do this again."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worse meals we have had. There was 3 in our party. I had medalions and swordfish which were okay but the sides were hideous. My wife's wings were overcooked and poor tasting. My sister ordered a baked potatoe that was okay and a side of onions,peppers and mushrooms that were so cooked and mushy that you could feed it to a baby or toothless person. The salad that was served was limp and had an unidentifiable bad taste. Cool atmosphere but I wouldn't recommend eating here.."}
{"text":"Used to love this place! Tonight the food was bland lacking flavor and the servers seemed to be in such a hurry just to rush you out the door. Had the tenderfoot Cajun style which was just average for the price. The sides tastes like they were straight out of a buffet! Highlight of the meal was the apple pie."}
{"text":"A few years ago I started working for a company based out of Arizona. Our orientation brought us to Phoenix. It was hot. Like Africa hot! Our hosts live in the area and took us to the Rustler's Rooste for dinner. 

The decor while gold-rush themed, was very contemporary in a gold-rush kind of way. The staff were very pleasant and friendly. We sat outside on this beautiful Phoenix night. It was 8 PM and must have been 110 degrees. I noticed as we drove around that everything in Phoenix was air-conditioned. I'm glad my hotel room had AC. I bet if everyone in Phoenix turned on their AC and opened their doors, Phoenix would be a lot cooler. Just a thought. 

Picture a Hawaii boy in shorts and t-shirt in Phoenix at night, sweating. It reminded me of Hawaii without the humidity. If they had a pool and hula dancers, it would have been perfect! 

The food was wonderful! But the best part was the Fry Bread. Yes say it with me, \"Fry Bread.\" One more time, F_R_Y B_R_E_A_D! It's the next best thing since sliced bread. OMFG! This night changed my life forever. 

I'm now a certified Fry-Bread-making-fool! Thank you Rustler's Rooste! 5 stars for the F_R_Y  B_R_E_A_D. 


Oh and Phoenixians, try the AC and open door thing and let me know how that works out for ya."}
{"text":"One of my favorite views in the valley. Food is good a bit over priced for what you get but still tasty. Service can be slow but its a big place. The atmoshphere of this place is its winning charm . few places like a steak house or similar give you the vibe they want you to have fun . this place with its built in slide and band that plays makes you feel like your having fun at dinner . not enough places do that, or some places over do it and get corny or cheesy ."}
{"text":"I really want to like this campy cowboy restaurant as it has wonderful ambiance, a great band, a cute longhorn bull that lives outside, amazing views and beautiful rock formations.  Sadly though the food was honestly terrible.  Guys - how do you screw up BBQ beef ribs?  What was that nasty mess?  It was as if you attempted to make a hybrid of beef jerky and BBQ.  These things were so dry, it was like eating an old shoe, and they hardly had any sauce.  I'm not hard to please with beef, I'm a frequent diner at the Sizzler and they put you to shame.  Also, were those carrots canned?  They tasted canned and they were small and weird, as if they'd been in a can.  I notice none of the colleagues I dined with finished their food either.  

All in all a really cool restaurant with absolutely terrible food."}
{"text":"I honestly had no clue what Rustler's Rooste was until a friend of mine took me here
At frist I just thought it was going to be something like Bill Johnsons Big Apple mixed with Toby Keith's but it was unique, very different. Upon arrival we used the valet because there seemed to be no parking (a tip for anyone heading out on a Saturday to the Rooste) 
When you first go into the restaurant there is a big bull in a fence, it was interesting but it added onto the theme and it was just pretty cool
The entrance itself is pretty cool, feels like youre walking in an old mine...
Second tip, I happened to call ahead to put my name in, which is pretty much a reservation. 
We were seated and I took in all of the surroundings, the inside was really cool and then I saw a slide...
I loved the mason jars everywhere
That stood out to me the most and I was really puzzled as to why it was there but the only thing I kept thinking was how original and fun that the slide added...
We sat close to it so I got to see pretty much everyone go down, there was a lot of children who went and very many adults even slid down
So you know I had to do it too, if the older people were 
:D
As we sat down the server brought us muffins and little frybread 
Im Navajo so I dug into the frybread, it was thick and doughy but I didnt mind that at all, I thought it was cool that they offered it, kudos. She also brought us salad as an appetizer which I thought was pretty yummy
I ordered the fried chicken which came with green beans and corn on the cob
We also got to split some cowboy beans which was beans mixed with hot dogs
I liked it
My food was actually really good so I would recommend this dish
Another cool thing was that after our meal we got free cotton candy which was super cool 
All in all if you would like a new, different place then I would suggest Rustlers Rooste
OMG I forgot to mention that there was live music, a nice band of country singers
That was my ultimate favorite part, I am a sucker for live music
After reading my entire review, I shouldve just started it off with the live music
The bar looked pretty cool too

Go here, enjoy it"}
{"text":"Took a friend here from out of town as I heard the views were amazing. We came for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was crowded. They do have a few things to keep you occupied while waiting like the poor bull locked up outside and the slide in the restaurant. The panoramic windows inside do give an amazing view of the skyline although we waited so long we missed the view of the sunset. When we finally were seated it took forever to order food and then took even longer to get the food we ordered. 3 of us in our party ordered the Nacho appetizer as our entree. When it came the chips were stale and the cheese looked like the dish had been sitting there for a good 15 min before it was brought to our table. Food was blah, prices were expensive, nice views and still had a good time with family. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to go here for her birthday, so we did.  There were three of us.  One gal ordered the fried chicken.  When it came, it seemed like two half chickens fried. I'm not sure if that's what it actually was, but it took over the entire plate.  She said it was good and moist.

My friend ordered the sirloin steak, and I ordered the filet.  The only sides that come with the meals are carrots and a small ear of corn.  I asked that no butter be on the carrots or the corn.  When my steak arrived, it sat alone on a very large plate.  Carrots and corn are already in butter and cannot come without, so I got nothing to go with the steak.  I asked if I could substitute something--\"NO\" was the response.  OK....I ate the steak alone.  It was good and cooked the way I requested.

A family style salad is served before the meal and a small bowl of beans (family style) is served with the meal.

If there is a birthday to celebrate, for $15 the birthday person can get a cowboy hat, bandana, cake and the band will sing Happy Birthday.  We had a birthday to celebrate, but didn't want all of that stuff (nor did we want to pay $15).  The waitress DID bring a large can filled with cotton candy and a lit candle on top.  It was a nice and different touch.

This place really is for tourists.  I've been there and don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Tourists trapping all gringos in AZ. Lower rated food  just go for Views over the Golf course."}
{"text":"I arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.  She was probably out for the night.  I promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.  A few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the second floor.  At this point, we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.  I parted ways with my daughter at this point.  I didn't need The DVD player to entertain her this meal, the slide entertained her till the food arrived.  She came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision, and then went back to sliding.  With some older kids present, letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious, but sipping my water in silence left me unconcerned.  I ordered a kids meal, grilled cheese, for her and I had meat.  My daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.  For my part, meat is good.  Clearly a tourist stop, as reflected in the price and by the décor, I've been waiting for some non-vegetarian relative to visit so that I can return."}
{"text":"So good we went two days in a row! Great service even it was busy and the food was amazing. The view is really nice too no matter what time of day and being up on the hill eliminates annoying road noise. They have a great kids eat free program and lots of family and entertainment. Ill definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great place for kids and nice view. They give you a lot of food but the steak could use some seasoning. The servers are very attentive. The balloon maker was a nice touch and the slide kept my kids occupied for the entire time. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Every time we come here I'm always hopeful it has improved but am consistently disappointed. The atmosphere, view, music, magicians, etc are fantastic. You are not allowed to sit at a booth unless you have five or more people in your group. Instead you are placed at a tiny table that is quickly overloaded leaving no elbow room whatsoever. They are extremely inflexible with your food choice not allowing for substitutions. Instead you are adding to your already crowded table with side baked potatoes or fries while a heaping plate of rice sits on your plate. Ridiculous waste of food. It's too bad. Lots of potential here but they rake it in so there's no incentive to improve. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste was quite a mix of feelings.  The building is rustic and the live music during dinner was nice. I went there two times in Jan 2012: the first night the waiter was without personality, it took a long time to get our food and the restaurant was almost empty BUT the food was good. The second night the place was packed, it took even longer to get our food, it was unbelievably hot inside BUT our waiter was great and the good was good.  The BEST things about this restaurant is that it is part of the Grand Arizona Resort which means they drive you from the resort to the restaurant and back and  you can charge food to your room.  Overall a solid OK and I would go back if I stay in that resort again."}
{"text":"First ... yes ... Rustler's Rooste is a total tourist trap. There's no way to get around that. It has rattle snack on the menu; waiters are dressed up in boots and cowboy hats - even though there isn't a head of cattle for 50 miles in any direction; and the steaks are at best average - but it's hard to make up for the view and patio dining."}
{"text":"Love this place and better yet, so did my kid!  Great food (there is a ton of it) and even better atmosphere.  Don't count on the service being that great but they aren't the ones hired to entertain you - they just pretty much bring you your food and drinks."}
{"text":"The steaks were cold and flavorless. The veggies were mushy, the salad had some flavor.  The service was slow and marginal. The price was high for the quality. The only good thing about this place is the view."}
{"text":"This was a good meal, unique environment, and reasonable price.  I had a steak, my wife salmon.  Portions we're generous.  We were there on a Friday night.. and there was live music.
We weren't wowed, but did have a nice time.
If I'm in the area again, I would come back."}
{"text":"Rustler's Roost - yeah I gotta love ya! Been around for awhile and you always take care of me! The food might not be totally great but everything else makes up for it. 

The view is amazing, the staff is great, the slide is super fun, and an all around great time. 

I have been here several times in my 25 year stay in AZ and always new memories. Many times as a kid with the folks, you know I went down that slide like a million times.... dad made me get off cuz it was time to eat. Dang it! Then in more recent years I have been for some work functions. They have a great patio that holds like 500 people or something like that. We had a charity event with dancing, food, bar, auction and mingling.... went off without a hitch. I would defiantly recommend this place for any corp or work function you might have. Book it early though, they fill up fast! 

Outside the main restaurant they have a great view of the city on their huge patio with a great fireplace. I will be back for sure when it gets cooler outside. You should too! and don't forget your boots for some boot scootin and boogie-in!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  Last summer we stayed at the nearby resort for a couple days and had a blast at the waterpark. We figured we would head up the hill to this restaurant.  They were packed-- waited an hour--  still not seated-- we left and figured we would try again in the future.
   The future was last night!  made a reservation for 6:30.  Got there at 6:20, no valet parking and very tight parking spots, but we made it in.  Go the front desk and they had a difficult time finding the reservation in their system even though they had texted us during the day to confirm. No biggie, the found it.  They then told us it would be 15-20 minutes until table was ready--  We were like cool---  even though we had reservation, 15-20 minutes was not a big deal.  At 6:55 we were still standing there and the kids were getting fussy so we asked again seeing as it had been 25 minutes...  They said it will be about 30 more minutes.  I am shocked!  Why have a reservation to wait an hour?  We left and will never go back.  Good luck, I can't comment on the food as I have never once been able to try it!"}
{"text":"I ate here 2 weeks ago. We were a party of 9 so we called ahead to make a reservation. They asked what % we wanted to tip our server which I thought was odd since we didn't know what we were going to eat or what type of service we were going to have. However our waitress was super sweet and helpful. She knew the menu and made suggestions which helped since 6 people in our party had never been there before. We got to the end of dinner and I knew the cotton candy would be coming and the kids were really excited. Well the machine broke earlier so we didn't get any. We asked the waitress if we could possibly get ice cream instead. The manager came over at that time. Wow. What an ass he is. He made 2 of the kids cry. Said no to giving us ice cream and then compared the cotton candy to the free mints you get after your meal at other restaurants. What a joke. But it was more his tone and body language that ruined our experience. I understand things happen but there is no need to be a complete asshole. Needless to say I used to love bringing my friends and family there but I will never go back. There is no excuse for an adult in the service industry as management to act like that."}
{"text":"This is my first review. I have to say this place left a bad taste in my mouth. I ordered the fried chicken and it had no flavor, it tasted like straight flour with no seasoning what so ever. The carrots and corn tasted like they came out of a TV dinner. I don't see how they can justify the price of the food.I also tried a piece of steak from my uncles plate and it was the same thing no flavor, it was like they put a piece of steak on the grill with no salt or seasoning. I will say the waitress was very nice and most of the workers seem friendly. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The food is good but what you come for is the atmosphere. Music and dancing and the view is amazing. There is a steer out front that the kids love and a slide inside that can be taken instead of the stairs that's a lot of fun too!"}
{"text":"Interesting place to visit with friends...could talk and look at Phoenix from above....large portions...ok food..good service...good bread pudding
Handy van service from Arizona grand resort ....smelly animal..I think a bull...at entrance...I guess it is the Western flavor"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out of town guests. I have lived here my whole life and have never even heard of this place until recently. I ordered the fried chicken and mac & cheese. They serve complementary cotton candy after dinner. Our server was so nice and a very at his job. I think to work there you need to have a lot of patience and be very chill as the environment is very fast paced. It's good to go just before sunset so you can take pictures. They have a beautiful view. Totally kid friendly as well. They have a slide for kids, big & small. There's also a great country band."}
{"text":"In Short...Decent Atmosphere, Average overall food Quality...WAAYYY Too Expensive.

For a place famous for it's steaks and ribs I was sorely disappointed. I was with a group of about 7 people. The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good...if a little too saucy...with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL!!! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat...the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs....Just Awful.

The Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare. 

The atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars, but it is a restaurant after all...so good food should be the focus"}
{"text":"I wish there were negative stars that I could give on here! Worst experience ever! We just finished dinner here for my birthday and not only did our services suck but the food was even worse! The corn and carrots tasted like they were boiled in dirty water and that water seeped onto my very tough steak. YUCK! So we complained about it and the manager asked if he could bring us out another one but we were no longer hungry from how disgusting  the food tasted. So we sat with our meals in front of us for a good 20 min. When the bill came our steaks were still on it. When we asked the manager to take it off he argued with me telling me that if he had something to take back to the kitchen he could do something.... they just cleared our table. Finally he took them off when we said we might come back but I really don't think that's going to happen. Learn how to handle a complaint."}
{"text":"Went there  with Party of 10. Service was good(Kevin) but that was the highlight. Trust me that there is no way this restaurant can be considered good. It is a tourist attraction but that is it.
No one in our party of 10 thought the food was good. 
I wouldn't normally write a bad review but I have a feeling that management knows the food is bad (how can't they?) but just don't care. They're making money regardless. I believe most place that have substandard food, try but just can't pull it off. Rustler's is probably pulling in the cash and just couldn't give a crap which is what their food tastes like."}
{"text":"This place is located on a high mesa, so it provides the best view of downtown Phoenix.  Great for a meal with some rowdy party people as the atmosphere is lively.   

Unfortunately, the food is just \"okay\".  The dining room is filled with \"picnic tables\" and the menu offers a decent variety of beef, chicken, and exotic foods.  The prices are a little high for the dining fare, but I suppose, you are paying for the view.  

I've been there 3 times, and each time, I was satisfied.  Nothing spectacular and nothing disappointing.  Go there for the view--and try the Rattlesnake--it DOES taste like chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place!

The Rooste is a SUPER fun place for kids and adults who still think they're kids. Think \"Red Robin\", with but better food, amazing upgrade of an atmosphere, and less germs.

Definitely recommend having dinner here with a party ready to have some fun. It's a tastefully put together restaurant, ranch house style. Tables aren't too close together, the waiters are pretty efficient, and the foood is goooood. (This review is coming from a vegetarian, but still, great tasting FISH, tasty SALADS and excellent POTATOES). I heard the ribs were great from my neighbor at our table.

 Be prepared for loud noises coming from all corners of the building, live music sounding all around...and there's a slide to keep hyper kids busy while you eat!"}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere; beautiful view, country band, congenial staff.  Most tasteless steak and prime rib I have ever found."}
{"text":"Took mom to @rustlersrooste for Mother's Day Brunch

Probably won't go back for a buffet any time soon.

We were seated on the patio. Nice view today, neglible smog impediment. Misters, and a nice occasional breeze, kept us quite comfortable.

The buffet had a decent selection of items, including roast beef, roast ham, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, Eggs Diablo, fajitas, spanish rice, etc.

Let me just say that the Eggs Diablo was delicious!

Moving on to everything else;
The bacon was overcooked, to the point of being almost black
The biscuits for the biscuits and gravy were a bit dry, and the gravy was sweet. I have no idea whose idea that was, but it most certainly doesn't work.
The wafflse station had cream cheese, strawberries, I believe cherries, and cinammon-backed apples. The apples were superb! Perfect consistency of slightly tender but not mushy, and VERY flavorful. The strawberries should have been capped, or at least cored, but they were tasty, and did not appear to have been sitting for a long period of time.
The beef fajitas had no spiciness at all. It was the blandest fajitas I have ever tasted.
The roast beef was cooked properly but was also bland
The selection of desserts looked visually appealing, but all those I tasted gave the impression that they were purchased off-site and delivered, not prepared fresh on-site. Of the desserts and the entree selections, nothing stood out, except the oatmeal cranberry cookies, which stood out for being hockey-puck hard.

The server was attentive, if only barely. I gave her a bit of a break, however, as it seemed that we were the only table she had on the patio. (Not the only people sitting on the patio, only people she was responsible for)

Given the price, I expect better quality, but I suppose perhaps I shouldn't, given the reality that rustlers is a cowboy steakhouse. Having eaten there in the past, I can attest to the quality of the western/cowboy type meals they serve.

I will visit Rustler's Rooste again, if only for the joy of seeing my daughters enjoy the slide, and the view, and some good cofort food.

But I will not likely return for their buffets, and I would not likely recommend anyone visit them for a buffet."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is an Arizona Valley Top Spot in my Family charts and clearly the hearts of many based on the echoing laughter and happy faces that filled the place. Although the house was packed as per usual, the professional staff managed with class, and friendly grace that flowed like a smooth country dance through the night like they've done it hundreds of times before. The magician 5 star! The band 5 star! The balloon guy 5 star! The Food 5 star!

The waitress Jennifer handled my Dad's 65th birthday party of 18 (with a few extras here and there) like a champion!! She was amazing. There were 4 children in this party and they had a blast! The view of the valley is breathtaking at night. 

Order the Rattlesnake (because hey-your at Rustler's Rooste-they have Rattle Snake dang), and of course have STEAK! Uh-mazing! And if you are wondering... yes they have awesome ranch and yes they have sweet tea, full bar, shuffle board, pin ball, dance floor, an indoor bridge, indoor slide, a Christmas Tree, a running fountain and walk through cave to enter the reataurant and.... a live bull. So choice!"}
{"text":"We've been a few times and think it's a fun place to bring people from out of town. I honestly felt that the steak quality was no better than Outback, but at least they have ambiance and live music. AWFUL PARKING THOUGH!! Use the valet, it's totally worth a few bucks (they work on tips).

The sides are good sides, with big portions. They charge a plate sharing fee, which covers the all-you-can-eat salad and beans. Salad dressing is excellent, and I like the biscuits (not so much the fry bread).

But I had to knock them down from 4 to 3 stars because I called ahead at 7pm and was told I was put down for 7:30. We arrived at 7:20 and weren't seated until 8:00 and that was after talking to the manager. The manager tried to tell me I \"can't hold him responsible\" for the delay. I'm sorry buddy, but responsibility always falls with the manager, especially when there were tables open that the hostess was trying to reserve for 4-tops even though we were waiting a half hour past our reservation. 

Once seated we had a great server, and the manager did stop by and apologize at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Awesome place, one of my new faves! Huge servings, family friendly. Bar upstairs, slide or stairs to get to main restaurant area. Very fun and delicious."}
{"text":"Rustler s Roost has a great view. A beautiful kitschy place to take out of town guests. BUT it's pretty expensive and what we had left a lot to be desired. The steak was chewy, the prime rib was too and the chocolate cake was very dry.  We went for a birthday and paid extra for the cake with a straw hat and bandana $17. I had been there years ago. I remember it being a lot better.  If I went again it would be for appetizers."}
{"text":"Well, food was bad. My shrimp was TASTELESS....I mean....no seasoning AT ALL. Bland rice. Others at the table said the same thing about their food. Amazing waiter though. For a crazy Friday night with kids everywhere...he was amazing and attentive. Wish I remembered his name. Very tall guy. LOL. This place is geared more for children for sure. A big slide, a balloon guy comes to the tables ect. An adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome. But I would say this place is more for kids than an adult night. That's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday and she and the family had the best time! Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful. There was a live country band with a gorgeous view of the valley. Food was perfect! 
Although I must say the icing on the cake was the magician! Listen, I was a sceptic as soon as he came to the table but he won us over in less than a minute with his charming and humorous personality. The magic! Oh my goodness the magic was hysterical. This guys had the whole table is aw! 
Second place was the free cotton candy! Will definitely be back soon! Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Live music, lots of history, busy feel, and very fun! Highly recommend if you're looking for something fun and unique! 
A little pricey, but you get SO MUCH FOOD! I ended up getting a kids 5oz sirloin and it was PLENTY for me! My husband got the 10 oz and it came with baked beans, corn on the cob, a huge bowl of salad for the table, sweet potatoes, and 2 types of bread! The prices make sense for how much food you get!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun fun fun. From the long horn at the front door , to the cool slide inside or the amazing sun set view. 

It's western theme so it's not super formal and either are the prices. Found this place on Yelp. They use to have a video on their page , which explained how cool this place was better then I could ever. 

Best place for birthdays and date nights. Come here watch the sunset then go play mini golf!"}
{"text":"Love going here.  Great atmosphere and great food and a dance floor.  Had a wedding reception here and it was on the outside patio in back....Was a lot of fun and cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great for kids and worth a visit once if only to use the slide. A tourist spot and of course we were tourists. The wait team was great and the food rolled out like a hotel banquet service. The food overall was just ok but we went to give kids a unique experience. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  The view is great  . . .but that's all that's good.  We waited 90 minutes from the time we ordered until our food (not hot) was served.  Couldn't get drink refills, the waiter's attention . . .nothing.  After an hour, he told us 3 or 4 times it was almost ready.  He kept telling us he \"had our back\".  Why do you need your waiter to have your back in a restaurant?  Were we competing for food/service??  Our table was never bussed between courses - I flagged down a busser to take away our salad plates,  dinner plates and bring more water. Evidently, the kitchen can't handle a dining room full of large parties.  Don't book them is you can't manage their orders without the rest of your guest's meals suffering. Thank goodness for the balloon guy and the magician coming by to entertain our 10, 11  and 13 year old.  Salad was iceberg lettuce swimming in ranch dressing w/ bad croutons.  Prime rib was served rare (ordered medium), baked potato (cold) was extra $$, all meals came with 3 cups of overcooked, flavorless sliced carrots.  Corn on the cob was frozen, baked beans were vinegar and ketchup out of a can.  Fried shrimp was cold and had way too much breading.  Fried zucchini served in a tortilla bowl?  Why?  Never offered dessert but brought cotton candy.  Waiter took the automatic gratuity off the check . . .before I told him too.  Our table was in a far corner of the restaurant away from the dance floor (good) but we all had to use the light from our phones to order and eat.  So dark we couldn't even see what we were served.    I'll call the restaurant directly tomorrow and speak to a manger.  Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is a pretty cool restaurant.  It has a rustic western feel without being too touristy.  The restaurant is family friendly and has live music pretty much every night of the week. 

They have an indoor waterfall and a tin slide for kids and adults to use.  

The food is your typical western stuff (lots of steak) and they even offer a rattlesnake appetizer for those who are a little more daring. 

Definitely a restaurant to check out if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"Dont eat the rattlesnake! Its $17 and tastes like popcorn chicken. Not worth it.

I ordered the Ribeye and it came a little undercooked but our waitress took it back to brown it up a bit more. After that I thoroughly enjoyed it! The sides werent very appealing, boiled carrots and bbq beans, didnt eat those. But the desert was fantastic! A cookie with ice cream...sooo good. They were also giving free cotton candy but im not sure if thats a regular thing or just because they had too much left over for the night? We passed. 

The atmosphere is fun and very country-like. Live music plus a slide to go down to the 1st floor....so cool! We'd come again but we'd be more careful about ordering and skip on the rattlesnake and sides."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I don't remember too much about the food, but the experience. Now that's a whole 'nother story. 

Picture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). 

Well, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. 

Once we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. 

Fried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. 

We're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. \"COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL\" 

Oh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6\"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. 

This platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). 

Oh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking. You get the picture? One last time.....Drink. Free. Boss. \"Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"As a non native to Phoenix, this place strikes me as one of those restaurants - every city has at least one - that represents a slice of local flavor and history.

Denver has Casa Bonita (don't try and disown it Denver, you know what I'm talkin' about) Boston has the Oyster House and others, New York has Sardi's and any number of other unique places.  I guess Phoenix has Rustler's Roost.

They capture the old west, the cowboy mythos and gitsch all together in one location and pair it with decent food, friendly service and a great view of the city.

I wouldn't dine here regularly but it is a good place to bring visitors.  They definitly get packed and there is not enough parking on the hill top so you may have a hike if they are really busy."}
{"text":"I love this unique place on top of a hill!  Beautiful views and a slide for the kids To go down.  There was also a band that started playing around 6.  Loved it!  We went today for our anniversary and reserved a spot at 5 pm.  Got sat right away but our waitress took a while to get over to us. Our waitress was a bit slow, her name wasJasmine.  You expect for a place that you have to make a reservation for and pay a high price to eat, they would ensure the waitress's are excellent. This one was not.  
The other pro was that the food was delicious! We had the nachos for an appetizer, salad, fried bread, biscuits, baked beans and the steak was Devine! It was cooked perfectly and very tender. My husband was left at the table and paid but the waitress never gave us the cotton candy that we were supposed to get.  We waited for around 10 minutes after asking her for it and ended up leaving without it."}
{"text":"We should have listened to the reviews about this place and avoided it. We live in Phoenix and this was our very first visit- we wouldn't go back again. The views are nice, its a homey western restaurant with a small slide for kids, but that's about it that's positive. The wait staff weren't very attentive at all- we had empty drink glasses most of the meal and the food was mediocre at best. They also keep a live bull penned up outside the restaurant and it smells gross."}
{"text":"A great experience every time we make it here.  Where else can you slide into the dining room?  We always have large groups and they are very accomodating, every table we've been at affords a beautiful view at sunset.  They try to make it a complete experience.
Servers are always very helpful and attentive.  Steaks are good and the sides are good if not very inventive.   The birthday dessert and cotton candy really cap off the dinners."}
{"text":"Great big steaks that taste pretty good and are very reasonably priced.  The menu is pretty much limited to various types and sizes of steaks...which isn't a problem with me! The view from the restaurant is beautiful, as it overlooks all of Phoenix.

I came in a group of about 25 people but since we didn't make reservations it would have been an hour before they could sit us.  So we decided to divide and conquer.

They do have a slide near the inside entrance that goes to the lower floor, though reviews made it seem like it was huge. It's very short.  Live band was decent and a decent volume, not too loud."}
{"text":"Our group ate a predetermined BBQ meal consisting of chicken, beef rib, beans, corn on the cob, salad, and a roll. Paula Deen would be proud. Much of the food I had in AZ was piss poor. I was hoping to order off the menu which I assume has got to be better. The view isn't all that great either. What is there to look at? The buildings downtown waaaay off in the distance?

The urinals(2) in the men's room are placed right next to each other almost like it's designed for siamese twins to pee in. There is no divider. What a joy to have some idiot step up and piss that close to me. I could only picture there being splatter all over my jacket & pants. Ugh, what an ordeal."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that our experience was like night and day compared to the last time we were here. It's funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has.
Let me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother's Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, \"This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here\". Well I'm not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here.
We ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit. 
I do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I've been a GM for some time, and I don't believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses'. Rustler's Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.

Tom,
First off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler's Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience. 
I pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate. 
The overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time. 
I appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler's Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn. 
Thanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don't think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler's Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee's in the late '80s. It used to be some place special to take out of town visitors, kind of a land mark if you will. I just think that time and expectations have changed."}
{"text":"Gross! Waste of money. The service and the atmosphere weren't anything great either. It's sooooo dark too. I couldn't even see what I was eating. I think that's on purpose. When I tasted it I didn't need to see it. What happened to fresh food cooked to order? So sad I can't get my money back. Hurts to have money taken out of my pocket on Christmas. My dinner went to the trash. :("}
{"text":"We had a great ti me here.  Ate some snake, cactus and prime rib.  Can't. Wait to come back."}
{"text":"The all you can eat ribs gave me gut rot.  
The \"cowboy\" making kids balloons was inspired by Pee Wee Herman's cowboy pal, yet he was even gayer.  
The band sucked but didn't know it.   
Overall it was like a cowboy Olive Garden, bread and iceberg lettuce.
Iceberg gets you 3 stars...."}
{"text":"This place is great, food is great, staff is great.
Been there several times and each visit everything is top notch.
Steak, BBQ, band, service.
Love the view too!!!!!
Oh and yes don't forget the cotton candy!!!!
Oh and the boots, boot mugs and boot shot glasses, yes, yes.
Anyone visiting Phoenix needs to see the view also.

I personally go back often and take visitors and Friends each time."}
{"text":"We thought this place was tacky, loud, and really really fun. It is a total tourist trap, but hey, we're tourists. Amazing steak, not so great \"basic sides\" but we ordered some other sides (jalapeño and Bacon Mac n Cheese, and baked beans) and they were amazing. Loved the appetizer plate with cheesy nachos. Cheddar cheese, yum. Anyway, this is not a quiet sit down classy place, but the steak was comparable to one and it was a good time"}
{"text":"The food at the Rustler's Rooste was just ok but the ambiance was really fun. I had the steak and enchiladas...why I chose this I'm not quite sure. I had already said I wasn't having mexican in Arizona. Oh well...the steak was good and the enchiladas were as expected..ok. The best parts of going to the rooste was the very fast slide to the bottom level and the free cotton candy at the end of the meal. It was a total surprise and the strawberry flavor was yummy! The live music was fun too...played all the good classic country songs. It was a little pricey but it's a steak place. If you are staying at the Arizona Grand Resort they shuttle you over and that was nice. Not a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I was here as a single guy.  I travel and it is not unusual for me to dine alone.  I was seated and then ignored.  I read the menu for 10 minutes with out being acknowledged by anyone. 

It could be good.  I will never know"}
{"text":"Dim lighting, good view and live country band on a Tuesday night. The whole table gets warm fry bread which is nice with regular butter and cinnamon butter. The table gets a salad but there's really no taste with the premix dressing. Our food took quite a long time and honestly wasn't worth the wait either. We came here because a friend of ours wanted to try the rattle snake which was over breaded, the pieces were very tiny and it came with breaded cactus which we couldn't tell between the rattle snake or cactus sometimes since the lighting was dim and it tasted over cook. 
Overall the ambience is nice but I don't think we will return for the food."}
{"text":"For my boyfriend's 27th birthday I wanted to take him to a nice steakhouse. He suggested Rustler's Rooste as a nostalgic visit. As a kid, he remembers frequenting the restaurant to celebrate anniversaries, weddings and good company. I was very excited to take him to the restaurant for that purpose and it would be my first visit there. It will also be my last.
When I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws. When I picked up the cup, I looked inside to find it was coated with what appeared to be paint chippings and dirt. It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet. 
Our food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible. 
I never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless. I think that reflects more on the restaurant than his skill sets. 
When we left it was a relief. The only reason I will go back is if I am asked to participate on Restaurant Rescue, or to save my unborn child's life."}
{"text":"Wow! After a very long day spent exploring, including the Desert Botanical Gardens and catching the sunset climbing the \"hole-in-the-rock\" in Papago Park, we were hungry. This is a don't take-yourself-serious kinda' place. Boy, did we eat. And, everything was great. I had the steak with enchiladas - it was delicious.

We didn't have a long wait, even on a busy Tuesday night, because I used the get-on-the-list link. What a great feature. The bread basket and free salad was a plus. We had the  nachos and onion rings as apps. Everything tasted fantastic and the place was super fun. We'll definitely be back on our return to Poenix."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, nothing really exceptional or out of the ordinary.  The rattlesnake was interesting (to say I ate rattlesnake) but tasted like bland popcorn chicken.  Price was decent for portions you get.  Good place to take family and friends wanting the \"Western\" feel."}
{"text":"The food is substandard. It started off right but then went downhill pretty fast. They made it clear we came in close to closing and they were ready to move us out. Good thing they have the resort next door to get fresh customers - if we lived here we wouldn't be back.  The steaks were on par with Denny's meat. And to serve boiled carrots and a small corn on the cob with it instead of a baked potato, which you could pay extra for, is just criminal."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Maybe it is because I am from Florida and we dont have places like this but it is still very good food. The view is fantastic if you can somehow sit by the window. I was there on a Friday around 530pm. Place was pretty empty but within an hour it filled up pretty good. They have a cool little slide to go down when on the 2nd floor. The ambiance is really nice. It has a real western theme. I had the salmon. So much food. So, much, food. Came with a salad. Minus points for only having ranch or oil and vinegar. Came with a real sweet bread and biscuits with cinnamon butter and regular butter. Came with rice pilaf and corn on the cob which were pretty darn good.  And....if you act now, it also came with beans. The beans were cooked with cut up hot dogs or something and some tomatoes in a tomato/barbecue like sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It had a nice sear to the top. The happy hour is pretty good. All in all, this place is a great find."}
{"text":"Had a blast, the Rooste is a fun place, loud, crowded and huge.  Wifey and I went there because it was close to our resort.  Had steak and it was good not great but the rolls and butter were fantastic.  The cotton candy was fun at the end of the meal.  Great service and very quick once we got seated."}
{"text":"When you are dining for the experience and the view this is your place. Situated in a hill it provides a panoramic view of the cityscape, best during sunsets for a picturesque experience.

Inside is a very cowboy inspired theme, with a live band, games and a slide, you heard me right... a slide!

Food is mediocre, prepared well, but nothing special. 

I peg this place as a place to take friends and family new to the area or visiting as it for sure will be a good time with decent food!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places I ate at while visiting Phoenix recently. Was there for a few weeks and went back a couple times. Their Filet Mignon rivals that of any great NYC steakhouse and the views are amazing!"}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 5 stars not only. Because the food but because the ambiance and atmosphere.  As I walked up to the door I took a wiff of a foul smell. I was like it smells like a barn. Sure enough they had a long horn outside. This place had live music and a good single mault selection.  The server was a cute blode in a white had with jeand and smoking lol. The chicken wings were goodd and all your drinks come like in jars.
I had the prime rib and It was Devine.  It was cooked properly and almost moving. The place had lots of things to look at and a slide ftom upstairs to down stairs.  The view is amazing and at nightu can see the city and all the lights from a distance."}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 with 8 kids. Everything was done correctly and to our satisfaction by one dude that waited on us, which is pretty solid. Magician for the kids was awesome, table side show for about 10 minutes after our salads. Food was good. If you're a foodie this is not for you as its a family restaurant with tons of kids. You'll find most of the one star reviews on this are from people that give one star or five star (probably like me), they either love it or hate it every time."}
{"text":"I loved it here! The atmosphere and everything! Our first time here and we got lucky and got a seat next to the window so we had a beautiful view! I ordered the vaquero plate and it was soo good. The mash potatoes  are to die for!"}
{"text":"Cool place to go with family, kids and groups.  Food and service is average at best but the atmosphere/view make up for it.  More like a gimmicky place to go, don't expect top notch cuisine here."}
{"text":"We love Rustler's Rooste! We just moved to the area, and have stopped by twice. Both times, the food and atmosphere were amazing. We ordered the NFL Burger, and it was phenomenal - enough food for 2 or 3 to share at a great price. We went there again for New Years Eve. We ordered a full rack of pork ribs, and it was so much food we had to take half home! Delicious! Great view! We will definitely be back - many times!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying~WOW!Roy Rogers and John Wayne would have loved this joint. What a great dining experience. I love this Honky Tonk and can't wait to saddle up and go back. Great service, value pricing and country western ambiance with a view to die for. Steaks cooked to perfection. The award winning  band was up beat and dance floor full. This place is cool and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Way overpriced! Steak was just so so, Margaritas way overprices especially for house booze.
Rattlesnake prepared horrible and the price ridiculous! After making reservations, still had to way for over 1/2 hour for a table.
Sides disgusting! Salad limp and lukewarm. Beans just awful. For a $27.00 steak you shouldn't have to pay extra for a baked potato."}
{"text":"Spent the holidays in Phoenix and ate here twice. Everything was delicious and prices reasonable. I had yhe all you can eat beef ribs for $17 both times. The best beef ribs I have had in years. Staff were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"So we saw a Phoenix morning show with a chef from here bragging about the biscuits.  NOTHING to brag about there but some of the food was good. Prime rib and sirloin steak well cooked but the corn was dried out. Fried mushrooms and zucchini okay considering you can't find it very many places anymore but mushrooms little dry too.  Food not fresh made ( sitting too long) or overcooked."}
{"text":"Our friends took us to this restaurant when we visited Phoenix a couple of weeks ago. It is perched on a little hill, with good view of Pheonix. It is a little rustic, with lots of families with yougn children. They also have an outdoor seating for parties. We simply love the food. We ordered vaiorus types of BBQ (pork ribs, beef ribs, etc..) and they were all simply delicious."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area about 5 months ago and have been wanting to go to Rustler's ever since.  I heard that the restaurant had a great view of the valley and was ideal for sunsets.  I finally got to go recently and I was kind of disappointed.  First, parking was strange.  The restaurant is on a hill and there was limited parking at the top near the restaurant and so there's additional parking down the hill, which you either trek up/down by foot or take a shuttle.  Second, I was expecting a romantic atmosphere but there were kids running around every where and even a slide for them inside.  Third, the food was expensive and not that great.  The food reminded me of the food you get at a buffet.  The place felt mainly like a  tourist attraction and is something you only do once. However, the view was nice, the restaurant had an old west feel with a live band and they give you free cotton candy at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"The highlight was the prickly pear margarita. Pink and icy and yummy! The gals went with that while the guys opted for brews. The server was attentive and friendly. Once our table was ready, we headed downstairs to be seated viewing a wedding in progress. Okay....different but not bad. We started by tasting the rattlesnake (which comes combined with prickly pear fries). Hard to tell what you were eating. Deep fried and crunchy. Not bad. Can say we ate rattlesnake now (okay, four out of five of us did - one abstained). Then the actual food was ordered. We tried a variety - southern fried chicken, steak and ribs. The salad served family style with ranch dressing was, well, ordinary. The chicken was wonderfully crispy and (darn!) BLAND. BLAH. Each meal came with over cooked carrots and over cooked corn cob pieces and about half a cup of beans for all five of us. Oh, and biscuits and fry bread with a choice of plain or cinnamon butter. The ribs were voted the best choice, but only because they actually had flavor. My suggestion? If you want to experience this iconic place? Come and enjoy the bar and view from there. Then grab yourself a bucket of KFC (or your choice of takeout), drive up to a hillside with lawn chairs and REALLY enjoy the experience. Cuz, after dropping a couple of $100 bills, the best we can say is YAWN. Seriously, get a 'well seasoned' chef!!!"}
{"text":"We whet some family here on Sunday night.  Fun place for family, good live band playing. Interesting story about restaurant.  Four people, beef ribs, pork ribs, sirloin steak and barb-b-q chicken.  Everyone like their meal, large portions, good sides of corn on the cob, house salad and baked beans served family style, vegetables, biscuits and Indian fry bread.  Good service. Beautiful scenery overlooking Phoenix at night.  Only complaint, it was so dark, we had to use the flashlight on the phone to read the menu. Need more light to see what was available otherwise great experience"}
{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving dinner for the first time here, and had a great time. The turkey and sides were surprisingly good. The service was slow, but I felt bad for the waitress because the place was jam packed. I could tell she was doing her best to keep up. We still managed to have fun with family despite our drinks taking a while. The views are unbeatable and I like that they have plenty of space for the kids to run around when you sit outside, so it was a stress-free day for us. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We were in the area within the last few weeks and decided to stop by for the first time for happy hour (Monday-Friday 4pm-6pm). As we walked in we went down a hallway that felt like a cave. We were greeted by the hostess and asked for a booth but she explained that they were seating all customers in a certain section of the restaurant at that time. It was slow so we were seated right away.

We began looking over the Happy Hour menu which was pretty weak. I believe it was $1 off certain food items? My boyfriend ordered a Coors Light (bottle) for $4.50 while I sucked down free waters. The waitresses carry around a huge mason jar full of water for refills which was really cute! 

For an app we ordered Frank's hot sauce wings. We also ordered the cheeseburger chipolte ranch which had jalapenos on it. It came with a side of french fries. The burger was very tasty while the french fries were bland and tasteless. Our meal also came with biscuits, indian fry bread, a huge dinner salad coated in ranch dressing, and bbq beans. They also brought out cotton candy for free after dessert. It felt like we were eating at a buffet! All the sides were tasty and I loved the salad. 

We had a lot of leftovers to take home and for all of that food we only paid $31 before tip! The views of the valley from our table were also amazing. While we were there during the day I would also like to check out the view at night as well. Service was decent and we will likely return in the future.

*They also have a slide, full bar, music (not sure during what hours), shuffleboard, and arcade games."}
{"text":"Food was great, though the service was tad slow (though in their defense, the place was packed). The kids were well entertained on the mini slide and the live bull outside. The view of the valley was very cool. There was also a live band that was good and they were not overly loud, allowing for easy conversation.

Great place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome atmosphere with terrific views!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is tons of fun, has great food, great service, and a great view of the city! I definitely recommend making reservations, no matter what night you're coming or how big/small your party is. Make sure you ask your server to have the Magic Man come by your table...he's amazing! Bring some cash with you so that you can tip him. Definitely go take a look at the view from the back patio before you leave. The city lights are very pretty at night."}
{"text":"went there once before, great food, great service.  We took my girlfriends parents out to eat there sat nite, thinking it would be a cool AZ experience for them.  Was I wrong!  Waited almost an hour for a table(no biggie, it was a Saturday nite).  We ordered our food and one of chose the special that was posted on the table on a placard.  When our 4 entrees came out, the person who ordered the special(my GF dad) got something completely different!  The waitress apologized and said that special was from feb, this order was on MARCH 8.  So when the food finally came(e3 of the meals) the kitchen runner set it table side.  The waitress never came over to disperse the plates of  food, so I HAD TO DO IT.  3 of the 4 ate dinner, while the fourth entree was almost 20 minutes late to make up for the mistake, he had to choose another entree from menu.  The GM came over and wasn't too accommodating, offering a free dessert.  I wanted the persons meal who had to wait comped and he offered a 20 percent discount on it.  I will NEVER eat there again. The food was so-so.  Service was terrible.  AVOID!"}
{"text":"Friends don't let friends drink and slide!  The fun of this place is drinking and sliding so if you came for the food forget it.  The appetizers and drinks are the way to go.  The rattlesnake doesn't taste like rattlesnake (but I think it was).  It was kind of fun going down the slide buzzed with a bunch of friends.  Don't try going down head first or any other crazy moves or you could get hurt. It can be a fun place to have a couple drinks, listen to some music and enjoy a great view with a nice ambiance. I wish the food was better as it would be an amazing place to go.  My review is based on the drinks and slide since the food sucks."}
{"text":"They have this very cool slide.They also have good steak and even serve rattlesnake. Great for kids. Beautiful view of the city. Go here."}
{"text":"We ended up visiting this restaurant one day, after our barista at Starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her 'other job' weren't tipping well, forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant.

So we show up later that evening.  Anyways, the decor is rustic but outdated.  The menu is limited, and you have no options.

\"What do you mean by no options\", you ask?

What type of salad dressing would you like?  Ranch?  Not a fan of Ranch?  Are you sure?  Because that's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix.  And to spice things up a bit, they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes.

And do you like corn on the cob, and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar?  I hope so, because that's all you gonna get.  Sound appetizing?  Sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward  your meaty centerpiece.

My wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib, which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having, and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth, void of flavor.

I ordered the 'Trail Hand' T-Bone, because I like T-Bones.  You should just call me 'T-Bone'.  Anyways, I asked them to serve it rare, because I had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak.  It was incredibly bland, and destitute of the juice I craved.  It wasn't dry.  More like a raw piece of steak.

Wanting to salvage the evening, I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem.  Strike three.  The apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever.  The dough was either overkneaded, or cooked in a microwave.  Kind of stretchy.  A few bites into this, and we knew... prognosis negative.

This review gets 2 stars, with one of those stars coming from the entertainment.  Yes, the one bright spot was the live music.  The band sounded great.

This trip turned out to be a complete WASTE of money that would have been better served back at the Seattle Conglomerate."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.... This place was recommended to me and a few co-workers, no clue why! Horrible Service, Extremely Long Wait to take food order, deliver food, and bring out our checks (Total of 1hr just in waiting throughout the night), food came out cold, and the waiter forgot the Kids meal, brought it out last! Poor thing had to snack on my fries while she waited for her food. The checks even came out wrong! I was charge $60 for my $15 burger and $8 Drink.. waiter added 2 extra drinks and a kids meal onto my bill. My friends were visiting from out of state, and the waiter messed up their check, didn't explained to them beforehand that he would be voiding out the first charge and recharging their card for a higher amount before handing it back to them, and because they're from out of state, the bank ending up locking up their card due to fraud, and the waiter had the nerve to ask them \"what you don't have an extra $28 bucks in your account?\" And to top it off, the Manager (after a few times of asking for him), Don Gonzales I believe was his name, finally came out and did absolutely nothing at all to fix this. He wouldn't even refund my friends for the first charge and told them that there was nothing he could do, they were going to be charged twice. It was just such a horrible experience overall, I will never go back! The great view and atmosphere just isn't worth all of the trouble and headache this place caused."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Arizona Grand for a sales meeting and had 'the rooste' one night... I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the reviews. The St. Louis Spare Ribs were tasty and the view and atmosphere was great. It IS very touristy but that goes with the territory. Plan a sales meeting in Phoenix and be sure to book here. What a great time!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Trickery!
Be aware that the happy hour only applies to the \"Saloon\" area.  This is an area that has practically no view to the lovely outside surroundings.  I went thinking I could enjoy some discounted prices on food and drink while enjoying the sunset with my wife.  False.  Pick 1.  You can't have both.
Beyond this trickery, the place is pretty cool.  The slide is fun, and it's neat to do some dancing by the live band.  The cotton candy is for dinner guests only, so they won't give you cotton candy if you enjoy the happy hour prices.
The saloon area did have table shuffle board, which is fun.
So I liked the experience, but I felt like the happy hour promotion was a bit of a bait-and-switch scam.  Also, I really did not like the tri-tip pieces slathered in red-hot spicy sauce.  The beef tasted like tough chunks of chuck roast, and the sauce tasted like burning.  That's it.  It was too spicy to know whether or not it tasted good.  
The Philly cheese-steak sandwich and fries were bland.  Once we added salt to the meal, the flavor was dramatically improved.  The sweet potato fries were good (we got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer before we realized the sandwich would come with fries).  
There was only one waitress serving the saloon area, so I had to go on several missions to get more water, find salt, and eventually pay my bill.
The place is a mixed bag.  My advice would be to eat before you go, and then just enjoy the live music and the view of Phoenix from South Mountain."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, with just ordinary experience with food and service. What you come here for is the ambience. In the past the food has always been mediocre and ordinary service, again I come for the ambience. I'm a local. However we visited on December 19, 2014 and the place was packed, however I must say this was a much better experience. We started with drinks and then moved onto the rattlesnake appetizer, which was delicious. We all ordered steak.I had a fillet mignon medium which was cooked perfect. My two friends had prime rib which was cooked perfect. The sides were amazing. We had the balloon man make us an Arizona Cardinals player out of balloons to compete with another table who were Seattle Seahawks fans with their own balloons. It was a competitive environment between the two tables. They brought us free Cotton candy to end the evening. I really enjoyed this experience with my out-of-town friends and had a great time. I feel they have been reading the reviews and have upped the level of food and customer service. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food was not great at all. Have been here on 2 occasions and was not impressed with the ribs (beef and pork), bbq chicken, or steak. The beef ribs did not have much meat, pork were very salty, steak was a bit tough and chicken was just okay (nothing special). The cotton candy is fun, and the scenery is beautiful, but that is as good as it gets. Have not tried anything else on the menu, but would go again, as there may be something on the menu with flavor. Kids will enjoy the slide and atmosphere, and the live music is nice."}
{"text":"We arrived right when I opened at 5pm and was seated within a few minutes. The waitress was very friendly. The price are as large as the portions. My family of 4 spent $120 and that was with waters and 2 margaritas, no tons of liquor. I order the fried chicken and it was massive. I asked for no carrots, so of course I got a plate full of carrots. The chicken skin was good and crispy but the chicken itself was super bland. It had zero flavor at all. The cowboy beans that came for free was disgusting, I honestly would have been happier with a can of pork and beans and a can opener on the table. We also tried the rattlesnake.. you barely get any meat for the outrageous price tag. 
I enjoyed the views and the building itself. The cotton candy was a nice and unexpected touch. I might come here again but I would split a meal (since they are so massive) and would try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"We went with a group of seven last night (Friday).  We made reservations but would not have needed them.  It is a big place but it was not near capacity.  We were escorted to a table near the server's desk to the far back of the restaurant.  In order to view the menu we needed to use our phone flashlights.  We had some younger ones in our group but they could not read the menus either, it was soooo dark in there.  Five of us ordered the cowboy platter.  It is $26/person.  They delivered a bowl of buns that tasted like they came from a bag, just reheated.  The salad came in a shared bowl with soggy lettuce and few fresh tomatoes.   One person in our group found a very long hair in his salad as he was eating.  That shut down our salad appetite.  Cowboy platter was served on one cookie sheet that we all had to reach from.  We received 5 plates to use for our platter, but 2 of the plates had larger chunks of leftover food on them and hadn't been cleaned properly.  Maybe more of them were dirty but it was so dark it was hard to tell.  The plates were replaced but it took excessively long for fresh plates to be delivered so the rest of us were ready to eat but 2 people were still waiting for clean plates.  Steak tips were extremely small and flavorless.  They looked almost boiled rather than grilled.   We only received 4 pieces of shrimp even though 5 of us ordered the platter.  The seafood skewers were very overcooked and dry.  Chicken was also dry and flavorless.  Ribs were large but very fatty and not much flavor either.  All in all the food was extremely disappointing.  I wish I could say that one thing was excellent but there wasn't anything that we ordered that I would ever eat again.   The setting of the restaurant  was unique but our group will never go back because of the quality of the food.  It was one of the worst food experiences that I have had."}
{"text":"This place is loud, crazy, and beyond an experience.  Had the New York strip and was not dissapointed. Recommend sitting outside and taking in the view.  We didn't get that opportunity due to a private party but sat close enough to a window to still enjoy it.  My first time so I did enjoy the slide (you need to go here to understand)"}
{"text":"Great view great food but mediocre service. I would still come back here but this time I'll bring my 5yo. He'll love the slide inside the restaurant to get down to the 1st level, and the free cotton candy. I've read somewhere that says free meal for kids, so will see."}
{"text":"Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!

Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.

Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the \"rustic\" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?

No. No. And no.

From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes. 

They were helpful with extras (can you say \"More gravy please?\") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.

The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time. 

Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful. 

I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks. 

Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.

Oh. The. Holidays."}
{"text":"My mother's 60th birthday. I made reservation on Thursday for Saturday night and 630pm and 8pm were available times, I took the 8pm, but then called back 5 minutes later to change to the 630pm time slot, gal on phone said no problem. My husband, son and I arrived just before 630pm and our name was not on the list. Hostess said it must not have came up from downstairs yet. We were given a buzzer to wait until a table was ready. Once the buzzer went off and they walked us to our table, which was a booth I said my reservation specified a table, not booth, which when we were not on the list 20 minutes ago stupid me should have men-tioned that AGAIN. So we were given another buzzer and 30 minutes to wait. At this point, offering a drink or dessert would have been thoughtful. Plus the fact that we had flowers and pre-sents should have been a clue that this was a special occasion. 
Buzzer went off again and we were walked towards some tables which were all filled and then returned back to the waiting area for another 2-5 minutes then finally taken to a table on the other side. 
We order appetizers, which were pleasing. The sodas come in small jars, I mean two good sips small, tell server to leave a pitcher, especially if you are thirsty!
Once our food came out a runner sat it down on tray table and we waited a few minutes until server came over and delivered to us. 
For birthdays, they offer an éclair with ice cream. Kind of odd, I would have thought a brownie or cake, maybe cobbler? 
Atmosphere and view are great, but last few visits, the food quality seems to be lacking"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! Awesome view from the top of a mountain overlooking Tempe. Inside has the decor of a barnhouse with wooden beams galore and a live country band. Cool place to take visitors from out of town. Food is ok~ Expect huge portions. When you 1st arrive they bring you a bread bowl filled or should I say overfilled with buttermilk biscuits and Indian fry bread, counted 4 biscuits and 6 fry breads just for my husband and I! The bread is really good. Of course you must order the steak at a place like this, and both of ours was ok. Platters come with a huge bowl of salad to share and cowboy beans."}
{"text":"Completely touristy. But best food we had all weekend. Rattlesnake does taste like chicken. Our waiter Josh was the best. And the balloon guy Franko made our night. 

Beautiful sunset too!"}
{"text":"So when in Arizona one must try some of the local fares. I was dared to try rattlesnake and cactus. Served deep fried with the vertebrae in tact, I nibbled. It was much like chicken. The cactus was a surprise as it was tart and juicy. Almost addicting. Almost. Also chowed down on the BBQ ribs. Overly abundant and apparently all you can eat. I could only it 4 but our spunky yet charming waitress said she thought i could tackle 2 more.  Added value was the wandering magician comedian and general welcome guy (much like the Wal-Mart greeter). And for kids the ever popular balloon animal folks. But what made the meal complete was beyond the western ambiance, it was a spectacular view of the mesa during sunset."}
{"text":"This place has amazing views!  We were there for happy hour, paid about $21 for a glass of wine, two huge apetizers (potato skins and onion rigs) and a quart of beer.  The service was ok and the ambiance with the view was great. It was definitely different than regular restaurants."}
{"text":"The last 2 times my family and I have been here, food not what it used to be. Not worth the money.They keep raising prices and the quality keeps going down."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Sat at the bar and watched a game.  Friendly service.  Tried the rattle snake bites which were okay.  Played some shuffle board.  Not in a great location in the bar, but no too much of a problem.  Great view."}
{"text":"Well, if it were just the food I was reviewing it would be a two and the ambiance is cowboy-ish which really isn't my thing but my eight year old adores this place.  Before cub scouts if we don't have the baby we will come for happy hour and he will spend the entire time going down the slide.  The very best part, in the eyes of an eight year old boy, they have free cotton candy for dessert!  He's found his mecca."}
{"text":"It is far.  Entertaining for the kids with the slide. Dining alone the band was nice and the view is gorgeous!! Perk band and view.., food not that great"}
{"text":"Great view, but terrible food. We walked in and hardly anyone was at a table. Told it would be a 20min. wait. Fine, we went and sat at the bar, and enjoyed great Ginger and Jameson. The bartender was fun to talk to, and I wish that we had just stayed and ordered dinner from him. We started noticing people that came in after we did were being seated, so we asked and they finally seated us. We were served the saddest looking iceburg salad with watery ranch, and some cold fry bread pucks. We ordered two medium rare NY stripe steak, and they were brought to us cold, well done, with some nasty over cooked veggies. At this point I'm so hungry I want to cry. My poor husband had worked a 14hr. day, and this was our anniversary! The waitress was nice and took back our steak, commenting that maybe the restaurant was too dark for us to see if our steak was medium rare. Really?! We gave up and walked out. I don't know how this place has stayed in business this long?"}
{"text":"Az a Tempe native, I love the memories made here at RR. The view, live music, live bull, slide and rustic cowboy theme are what makes this place a gem. Kids love it here and will always remember the \"place with the slide\". For the adults, well you pay for the view and that's it. The food is a poor trade of price, shameful that they know it too. No server seems to take pride, and obviously the cook doesn't either.  Don't expect a southern cowboy chuckwagon feast; instead you'll get kraft mac n cheese, dry chicken, dry salmon, and decent rolls. For even a $35 steak, you'll get iceberg lettuce with bland dressing and dirty, tiny bathrooms. It's a shame they've let this treasure go so downhill."}
{"text":"I ordered half slab of ribs and they were dry, tough, chewy, and drenched in a sour tasting bbq sauce; so disappointing, because I was really hungry and it was expensive. Service was okay.  The location and ambience of the place was very nice; located on top of hill with a heck of a view of the valley and the interior had a very authentic western feel.  A magician came out to entertain us at our table.  I will not go back unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Prime rib was good, and the kids' meals were good sized portions.  The hostess was not so much rude, but indifferent-wrong person to greet people.  It was a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times with the kids. They love the slide in the middle of the restaurant and cotton candy at the end. Quality of food has gone down the last couple of times we've been here. Not sure what it is but i don't feel like it's worth what you pay anymore."}
{"text":"That was the worst meal I have eaten! The Steak had no seasoning at all!! The manager Tom comes by and asks how things are and we tell him the steaks have no seasoning and his response was we let you season yourself!! The only thing on the table was salt and pepper. We believe he got upset and walked away. The waiter never spoke to us other than to take our order. Then he came back once and we had to ask for drinks. He didn't ask how food was or how we were!

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!! Food and service is the worst!!"}
{"text":"I received a very nice call from management assuring me they do cater to special dietary needs. He reviewed this with the staff and I will go back. Thank you for understanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My kids had. Great time. From the live steer to the slide inside the restaurant. It was all amazing. Spectacular views. My shredded beef nachos were the best I've ever had. They even serve rattlesnake. Kids got a kick out of the huge cotton candy for desert. AND the restaurant is built inside an old mine! Amazing. A must try when in the area. Will be back again."}
{"text":"One of the least favorite dinners I've had. They had tasteless steak, the place was so loud we couldn't talk. Trying to hide bad food with quantity. Not good."}
{"text":"One of our go-to places when my family visits Phoenix.

The prime rib was excellent! The entrees come with a delicious salad and veggies, including corn on the cob. I enjoy the cotton candy that comes at the end of the meal. Can't beat the view, too! I just wish it were a little brighter in the restaurant, so we could see the menus better. But overall, it's always a great experience."}
{"text":"My nieces and nephew are in town visiting so we decided out take them out for a night to remember. Rustlers Roost once again did not disappoint. From the moment we started up the hill to the restaurant they were excited. They loved seeing the bull outside and the cave like entry. 
My niece looked like her eyes were going to pop out when the giant bowl of Mac & Cheese was put down in front of her. 
The highlight of the night was our visit to the dance floor to listen to the band and do a little dancing. The guys in the band do a great job interacting with the kids and really made their night by giving my niece their autograph. 
The reason for 4 stars this visit is because I think the food has gone down a little since our last visit although the beef ribs were  still good. Regardless, we will definitely be back for the view and the band."}
{"text":"Well, ye-haw back here in the desert...and bump a three and a half up to four stars for: 

-live music
-the slide into the dining room
-festive scene for the holidays
-excellent service on a large party (30 or so of us)
-ye-um! cactus fries (you heard me; I'm really liking the cactus)
-nice view of the Valley
-nothing changing in 20 years and sometimes that ain't a bad thing

I've only tasted the filet mignon here and it's good. Other meat dishes also look good and portions seem adequate. Though, that \"rattlesnake\" appetizer for $18.95 seemed light on the rattlesnake and heavy on the cactus fries. (But I haven't exactly been pricing \"rattlesnake by the pound\" so what do I really know?) Anyway, I have tasted rattlesnake! Tastes like chicken? Nope. Calamari! The rubbery type. Had I not myself seen an intact snake skeleton on a recent hike, I'd not have known that the spiny fried thing on the plate was the bones. (Um, don't eat that.) 

Most entrees come with sweet potato chunks (pretty sweet but delicious) and corn on the cob. Be sure n visit the other options available like: Jalapeno mac n cheese, baked potato, vegetables n so forth. 

You may just have room for the cotton candy and another bourbon at the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great view of the PHX at night.  Steaks are awesome!  The restaurant is literally built into the side of the mountain, and has great live country music.  You just have to go there at least once.  

The only negative is as you are walking into the entrance, they have some small bull penned up out front.  The poor creature looked depressed as hell (so would you, if you were going to be dinner!), and I actually felt guilty looking at that poor bull as I was walking in to eat his brother.  That guilt lasted only until I got my menu, though. Meat may be murder, but it is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Please stop animal abuse by boycotting Rustler's Rooste. I was at the restaurant with friends on Tuesday, April 6, and the first sight before entering was the cruel confinement of a large steer in a pen that did not allow him to roam or forage. He was lying down in his own excrement. The confinement and mistreatment of a large animal is not needed for a restaurant's success. I have reported the abuse to the Arizona Department of Agriculture, and hope others will do the same. The phone number is (602) 542-0872, select Option 3 and leave a message for investigators."}
{"text":"We were here last Saturday and had a really good time. The steaks were delicious and the service was good. Hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it (it was his first time having it)
My only complaint was that the music was REALLY loud for a restaurant but hey, we were entertained. 
We had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. We were a party of six. I ordered beef ribs that were bones doused in BBQ sauce. Those who had steaks were OK. One person had fried chicken that looked like pigeon and way overcooked. The sides were adequate at best.
However, the service was very good.
We will not be back."}
{"text":"When the bread basket arrived filled with hot, flakey, tender, and tasty biscuits, we had high hopes for the rest of our meal. Sadly, they ended up the best part. 

If you do go, expect a wonderful view of the city lights and a loud, lively environment, but don't come for the food. 

Biscuits: awesome - they deserve applause.
Snake: too tough to chew. (Yes, we tried it.)
Salad: swimming in the dressing and tomato was spongey.
Potato Skins: cold and strange flavor.
Ribs: they were not falling-off-the-bone. The steak knife could barely separate one rib from the other. They were lukewarm with ho-hum flavor.
Corn: mushy
Green Beans: fine
Surprise Cotton Candy: cute and sweet

We were looking forward to a great experience, but left feeling like the smell of the steer manure at the entrance should have been a premonition: The food stinks, too!"}
{"text":"Normally only open for dinner, I was part of a large private party that the restaurant accommodated for a buffet lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Each person was served a steak, chicken breast, 2 roasted potatoes, roll, corn-on-the-cob, and iceberg lettuce salad. A full cash bar was also made available. Iced tea, ice water, and coffee was complimentary. Loud country music, an indoor slide for kids and the young-at-heart, and a great view! Open since 1971!"}
{"text":"Food was great table was small/tight.  Other than that atmosphere was light and fun.  A new dining experience for our guests."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place even one star is because the band was good.  Went in on a whim last night,  cool atmosphere.  The salad was soggy and tasted like it'd been sitting out for awhile. We shared a burger and fries. Fries were stale and cold and the burger totally fell apart.  We couldn't even eat it.  Tab for soggy salad, stale fries and gross burger-$47. Save your money. Dont go here."}
{"text":"Great view of the city. Our food was very good. Had the filet and beef ribs. Service is very good. Tables are too small though.  The cotton candy after dinner was a great surprise."}
{"text":"I took a few corporate colleagues from San Jose California here one night for dinner.  The food was good.  It was a bit loud though."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner while having a staycation at the Arizona Grand. We loved all of it! From the bull out front, the mine entrance,  live band, slide, and view of the city you can't go wrong. The food was great, and we were happy to find when we got our bill that kids eat free! They even got cotton candy for dessert. :-) Great time had by all."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great steak and service was very friendly. We sat at a window view table which was perfect for our last night of our mini vacation. Ribeye was cooked perfectly and the portion size was huge. Not a big fan of the salad it came with but the corn and breads were a nice compliment. This will be our go-to steakhouse when I'm town. And the wait was less than 8 minutes. Bonus"}
{"text":"I seriously can't wait to take my parents here!!!  After the OYE, I called Mom to tell her about the slide.  The one that I didn't really make it down very well because my legs were sticky from the walk up the driveway.  Well, I got a ride, but it was still hot out.  I know.  Gross.  Whatever.
The service here is suuuuuuuper friendly!  Everyone was really nice and seemed to be enjoying their jobs.
The food I would say was OK.  Great variety, though not overly original.  Options for vegetarians, too.
I'll definitely be back a LOT.  My stepdad is gonna love this place!!"}
{"text":"I brought a party of 25 here for my son's birthday. Almost everyone at the party ordered steak. Everyone had the same complaint- the steak was flavorless and of horrible quality. This is so shocking because this is a steak house, but I could literally make steaks better on the stove top in my kitchen. 

One other thing that rubbed me wrong about the visit - my young children were all in line for the slide. They range in ages between 2 and 9. They waited and waited and waited for their turns, they were so excited. Out of no where an employee came up and roped off the line and proceeded to allow himself and a party of 20-30 drunk adults cut all the children and go down the slide. My four year old was bawling her eyes out. We teach our children to wait and here are all the adults cutting them. Many children were already at the bottom of the line waiting for their siblings while these drunk adults came down the slide laughing. Some were wearing dresses and everyone at the bottom could see EVERYTHING!! No class at all. 

After a $700 bill for horrible food and a bad experience with the staff cutting kids in line- we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party here last year, and have been here for other party's as well. The food for me hasn't been all that great.. The steak, while still good, was def. Over rare. The chicken wings, sliders, mozz sticks and mushrooms were good. Amazing views here!!!! The slide is soo much fun! We broke the rules and had a huge caterpillar slide! Pretty good strong drinks and fun atmosphere. Bartenders and servers were busy but always around for drinks and emptys.:) will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was TERRIBLE from the hostess to the servers to the manager.....BAD. The Price of the food does not leave room for bad service. Take your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Fantastic view!  Unusual experience.  Try the slide on your way into the restaurant.  :)  Be careful of the big long horn outside!  (Be careful not to miss him, that is!)  As a pesco vegetarian, I had worries about this place.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a veggie burger on the menu.  It came with some great toppings on it, which proved to be too much for me to eat all at one sitting.  The nachos on the appetizer list are also amazing, but too huge to be shared with less than three other people.  If you've got out-of-town guests in tow, definitely bring them here for the view and the cheesy southwestern dining experience.  I hear great things about the rattlesnake..."}
{"text":"For a specialist steak restaurant, I was expecting a decent steak. Unfortunately what I got was a really, really well themed restaurant that seemed to feature quantity over quality and gimmiky stuff (candy floss on check) which, while nice, doesn't really enhance the meal. 

To be completely honest, the food itself would have been a 2 (yes, the steak really wasn't that flavorful) however the staff and live band made up for it. 

I wanted to love this place, but couldn't :("}
{"text":"Howwwwwdy Partner!

A fun atmosphere with a lot to look at.  We went here on a Friday night it was BOOMING.  Country music by a great band and accompanied by a slide on the right side of the stage.  The kids were having such a great time on that thing.  

A couple of great things:
The deep fried snake (tastes like chicken)
The brew on tap
The cotton candy afterwards

A couple disappointing things:
The steak was done alright.
The value of the meal
It's definitely a tourist trap.

Ya'll come back now, ya hear...or maybe think about it."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday around 7PM with a coworker and was surprised at how full the parking lot was. The wait was about 30 minutes, but we were able to grab two seats at the bar immediately.

This is a country western style restaurant with live music. Everyone seemed to be having a good time and in good spirits. 

The rib eye was cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare and was a great cut of quality beef. My coworker had the pork chops and was just as happy with his meal. I will definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and fun! Our waiter was amazing have  us great recommendations from the menu he never let our drinks get low. They serve you a huge basket of assorted bread w cinnamon butter & regular butter.  Rhey have a live steer right outside the entrance of the restaurant named Horny , a slide kids can play on and a live band . At the end of your meal they bring you a can with a large cotton candy in it for dessert . It's a must try if you are in the area just for the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for about a year and have never felt the need to write a review... until now! This place is GREAT! I've lived in the Phoenix area for just over a half a year and I'm upset I hadn't come sooner! The views are amazing and the food is just as great! Complimentary rolls, salad, and cotton candy! Fun atmosphere (you have to go down the slide upon entering the restaurant) and sometimes there's a live band. You will leave this place with a full belly, a happy group, and some great scenic pictures!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend, so we decided to try it. We read the reviews, and they were mixed. Our experience was decent, but service is a bit slow and they were rushing a bit. The food was ok, but the fries weren't the best. The steak was good, but a bit harder to chew than most steaks. The view was very cool, and the location was good."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Not the greatest,  it is just edible. For is over priced and is you go near closing they don't want to serve you.  We arrived am hour and a half before closing and the hostess was rude and wouldn't sit us near the band.  The waiter just wanted to go home.  In fact another group sat down behind us and they left within 10 minutes.  Bad service and food is definitely not worth the price.  

The view is nice,  the bar is nice and the band plays well.  Nice ambiance  and western feel."}
{"text":"Always a fan of trying a locale favorite but this one was just ok. Great view and very good service. Food...just ok. The steak was a bit overcooked and it came with carrots and corn which were equally ok. Tried the rattlesnake which I'd suggest and the beer selection was good. Not a place I'd feel compelled to visit again but not bad."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Phoenix. I asked about the all you could eat ribs. The waiter said that they were slow cooked and they produced a bark. I thought, finally I found a great rib place in Phoenix - wrong!!!! 

These ribs were fatty, greasy and had a HORRIBLE flavor. I honestly could not stomach them. Now as I sit here writing this review I wonder if I will be able to keep the food down tonight! 

Honestly, the food for the entire table was unremarkable. It sounded good on the menu - the Mac n cheese... loaded potatoes... cowboy beans. They were over priced and low on flavor. 

Honestly, the best part of the meal was the bread and salad. I regret not eating more of that so I would have at least been full for the $30 I spent on dinner. 

To make matters worse the waiter seemed to hate his job or maybe it was just our table. 

At least we all got in a little workout climbing the hill to this place."}
{"text":"The rattlesnake is not good. 90% breading and only a few pieces. Prickly pear frues were good. Isaac the bartender was also good. If you want rattlesnake go to Sedona it's worth the drive, their Steakhouse has a phenomenal appetizer with rattlesnake that is good. No bueno rattlesnake and the Rustlers Roost."}
{"text":"Never expected that it would be that huge.   Great food.  I couldn't finish the burger...too full.   Fry bread at the beginning and cotton candy at the end.  All of our food was great.   Price is worth the view and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place because, like the other reviews, say it does offer a spectacular view of the city and the old western country theme and vibe with the live music was such a cool experience! Unfortunately I was dissatisfied with our server Adrian (sorry to call you out man) he wasn't very attentive or engaging with us and several times throughout our stay he either didn't clarify with us and mistakenly took away our salad plates when we had asked him for another family style salad and we all just felt awkward. My mom asked for a scoop of ice cream and he said \"sure no problem\" but sadly it never arrived. The beans we got weren't very tasty and they were served almost cold because it seemed like they must have been sitting out for awhile. We did however still enjoy our stay and the steaks we got were good not great. The fun part was getting some cotton candy at the end of our meal and all of us getting to tear into it like we were at a state fair! 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Charming place, full of quaint Western decor. The food, however, was not up to par. It's as if they were trying too hard. The steak was so heavily spiced as to be unrecognizable. The western beans hardly had any beans with all the other stuff in it."}
{"text":"Great place to see a sparkling city-lights view at night.  Also a great place to experience some (slightly hokey) western atmosphere.  I love bringing out-of-towners to this place as they feel like they got a \"real southwesterny\" experience.  Unfortunately, the food can be kinda hit-or-miss.  One night, all our entrees came out cold.  Another time, our steak was mostly fat, hardly any meat.  It is kinda pricey for what you get, but it's worth it if you want to show a visitor a good time.  The FRY BREAD makes it all worthwhile too.  Definitely call ahead for reservations on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Went with friends while in Az.  Such fun & great food!  Don't hesitate!  Best steaks and some different apps."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is 5 stars, and the food is about 3 to 3.5

All the extras were tasty, especially the homemade biscuits with cinna butter and honey. I got the T-Bone steak, which was reasonably tasty. But, ultimately the food was very similar to going to your backyard and throwing some steaks from QFC on the grill. Certainly nothing wrong with that, but maybe need to go further when you call yourself a steak house.

The outdoor eating area was amazing. The view was for miles. Inside is very \"Texas\", but I think that's what the people come for. Pretty good joint."}
{"text":"Come here for the experience of it, not the food. Worst ribs I have ever had, and my wife's steak was tough as leather. I guess that is to be expected when serving this quantity of people, similar to an all you can eat buffet or conference food. Complained about the steak and they took half off."}
{"text":"beef ribs were perfectly spicy and sweet.  the indian fried bread and biscuits with whipped cinnamon butter are great.  i loved the whipped butter served room temperature."}
{"text":"Food is average. Ambiance is interesting if touristy....live music is a bit too loud for the kids, but the casualness of the staff and the folks there is perfect for relaxing when you have kids. You don't have to worry much about the floor when there is sawdust covering it. I bet it is better as a date place, later at night, with dancing and drinking galore. Location is beautiful.

The menu is difficult to read and could be much better designed. The steak I had was so-so. The kids' food was also so-so. But there was a lot of it. And the kids ate free. How can you complain about that? 

I couldn't enjoy the view much because the light of the window backlit the others in my party. I couldn't see my own kids or my husband. That's not an advantage when trying to cajole an 11, 7, and 3 year old to eat."}
{"text":"Seriously, do not go here. The food was inedible, the service was worse. I know it's a gimmick for tourist but that is no excuse for badly prepared, badly cooked and over priced food. Sent the rattle snake back because it was breaded hard hockey pucks and the servers response was \"what did you expect\".  Figured the burger would be safe and what I got was a frozen burger that was cooked to death. (I ordered it rare) I could go on and on but save your money and go elsewhere. I'd give it 0 starts but thats not an option. On the up side the view is nice."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on a business trip and Rustlers Rooste was conveniently located near my Resort's property so despite the lukewarm Yelp reviews I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the mixed drinks (I had the top shelf margarita). I heard you should stay away from the steaks but if you get burgers, chicken or ribs you're going to be fine plus it comes with amazing baked beans lots of Bread & rolls salad Etc. Dessert menu look awesome but I didn't have any room. 4 stars"}
{"text":"I like the location of the place and the view was fantastic it was OK and it was very very busy and very loud my experience with the food wasn't the greatest the cheesy jalapeño macaroni was exactly the opposite and It was very dry and lacked cheese I had to ask for extra cheese to make it edible i'll have to come back and revisit this place (maybe) but as of right now it won't happen in the near future"}
{"text":"This place was way better than the 3 star rating it has on Yelp. We tried the rattlesnake, just because. We had prime rib, it was excellent. The salad and sides were great and to top it off, they brought a tin of cotton candy at the end. The view as also nice, we called ahead and sat right down when we arrived. I think this place is great for people visiting Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat , food is a bit pricey but well worth it and if you get a seat next to the window great view of phoenix."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We always can me here when we are in AZ!  The atmosphere is awesome and has great energy!  The kids LOVE the slide.  If you have kids you must check this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Rustler's Rooste is one of my favorite casual dining places.  I know a lot of people just come here for special occasions or to take out of town guests, but I cannot help coming here often.  The view of the valley at sunset is spectacular.  

You cannot go wrong with anything beef here.  I happen to prefer the AYCE beef ribs (I never eat more than a plate, but I like the option) without extra sauce at the end.  They're tender and delicious.

And who doesn't like the cornbread or fry bread you get along with cowboy beans (caution: contains pork) for the table.

Every meal includes a salad, the beans, and usually has sides such as corn and green beans or rice.  

A reasonable meal for four is around $100 and you leave with leftovers and feeling full.

It's a fun place with a fantastic view.  

And, if you're up for it, you can finish off your meal with complimentary cotton candy."}
{"text":"Came here on a quick visit. Food was good, the atmosphere was different but a good different (cowboy style). Definitely loved the views and the slide."}
{"text":"I stopped by Rustler's Rooste with work colleagues for a fun dinner before heading to the airport.  The atmosphere is fun and unique.  There is a live bull outside, an indoor slide and live music.  The service we received was great from the parking attendant to our waitress.  The food was good, meals come with delicious biscuits and cinnamon butter and a big salad for the table.  Our food was good and quick, and you get good value for your buck.  What really put the service over the top was that I forgot something on our table right before heading to the airport.  The team at Rustler's Rooste was so nice and helpful and even shipped what I left there back to me in NY.  Great service, good food, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We heard from several people that this a must-go place to dine at during our trip to Phoenix, Arizona.  I have to say it was definitely worth it!  We had a large group of 16 people and we were all served our food quickly and refills came even quicker.  The portions were perfect, you definitely don't leave still hungry. The drinks were poured with a heavy hand and tasted delicious.

The entertaining saloon atmosphere was perfect, especially the indoor slide for the kids to play on while the parents danced the two-step if they felt the urge.  The fun cotton candy deserts impressed both the kids and adults alike.  The outside has a beautiful hilltop view that you could see from the inside dining area even if you're sitting in the back and the sunset is gorgeous.

It was definitely a exciting place to go and if I'm ever in the area again it will be a must to go again."}
{"text":"If you like meat,  and a bit of fun, this place can't be beat. Perched on its own hill, a live (and huge) Longhorn Bull corralled outside, grilled steaks, rattlesnake meat and a slide down into the restaurant with a great view."}
