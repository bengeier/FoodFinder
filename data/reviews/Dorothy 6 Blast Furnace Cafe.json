{"text":"Food is great, fresh and hot. Could swear you are in San Francisco or Pearl district Portland Oregon Great music and drinks and very clean. Stop wasting money at the waterfront.

Ruben sandwich is very good reasonable

Steaks and Brussels sprouts perfect

Beet salad recomended"}
{"text":"First time trying Dorothy's, so glad we did! We always go down to the restaurants in the waterfront and saw this restaurant on Yelp with good ratings. We would definitely go back! We started with smokestack martini's - De-Lish! The pierogi's for an appetizer, very good. Everyone enjoyed their entree's, flat iron steak, crab cakes, Reuben sandwich. My husband ordered pierogi's for entree, which were good, but felt they were overpriced, could have had a steak for a few dollars more. I loved the atmosphere and our service was good. Looking forward to going back again, especially when weather warms up, as they have a nice area for dining al fresco!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Dorothy 6. The atmosphere is comfortable with a sleek mix of industrial accents (from the historic furnace, Dorothy 6) and modern  decor. The gigantic chandler in the entrance way is unbelievably entrancing. While the upstairs loft could be a cozy space to spend on date night or with a group of friends! The outdoor space proves a metaphorical oasis in a \"cement jungle\", and the employees who assisted me were knowledgeable and friendly!"}
{"text":"Waited 4 hrs for a chicken sandwich.  The chicken was mediocre at best.  Ordered a second beer and the waiter just forgot. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!! How do you forget?!?  God only knows what happens when this place is actually busy. I also don't understand the name. Why Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace? What happened to Dorothys' 1 thru 4? Why not Dorothy 7 or 8?  Why not take a trendier name like \"XYZ Public House\" or \"XYZ Micro Brewery\". This place is a must miss."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, good food, good price, good location, nice atmosphere, decent service.  But on a night when they were not all that busy, it took forever to get our main entres.  They served us our soups and salads before they served our appetizers, and then from the time they cleared the appetizer/soup/salad dishes, it was almot 50 minutes until the entres arrived.  I had the meatloaf, and although it could have used more gravy, it was good.  My guest had a steak and it was done just as ordered.  The apple pie wasn't the best I've had, but it was good.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"I was told about Dorothy 6 by a friend and joined him for dinner.  I was surprised at how interesting the interior was and how I felt comfortable right away.  We were seated quickly and served efficiently with a warm reception.  What I really liked was that the food was prepared from, best I can tell, real ingredients that were not frozen and processed like I experience in many restaurants in this price range.  I could tell the difference!  I have eaten at many fine restaurants around the world and what I look for really is, was the food fresh, hot and tasty and appropriate portions. The other things I look for is having my water filled up and my beer served cold and not having to wait while I am enjoying my meal.  I have come back a few times and have experienced the great service, tried different courses and have become more enamoured with Dorothy 6.  I will NEVER eat at the Waterfront chain restaurants again.  The times I've been at D6 I felt welcome, but not like I was intruding on a neighborhood bar.  I have written 3 reviews in all my years using Yelp.  One slamming a restaurant, one for a services company and this one.  Stop at Dorothy 6 on your way into the Waterfront, on your way out, or if you are looking for a great restaurant it is worth the drive.  i like unique places and great food and a great beer menu, D6 fits this bill perfectly."}
{"text":"Although I was somewhat underwhelmed with the decor, it's refreshing to see a non-chain place pop up in Homestead. To put it simply, this place is ideal for a laid-back lunch/dinner. The drink selection is extensive and the entrees (while not especially inventive) consist of sturdy, comfort foods. Myself and my friend both went with the perogie entree. (I'd give two thumbs up for the standard cheddar perogies, but can't say I recommend the bacon/beer flavor.) The meal also came with a delicious side of brussel spots, and I added on a side of tender corned beef as well. Given the casual setting, I expected a smaller bill, but the delicious food and friendly service will likely make me a repeat visitor."}
{"text":"So glad this spot exists.  It's a good addition to the developing Eighth Avenue scene in Homestead, and I genuinely hope they outlast some of the other places along Eighth Avenue in Homestead that had to close down over the years due to the stiff competition from the mainstream chain-heavy Waterfront across the tracks.

I've never been here without enjoying a good meal.  The brunch is especially worthwhile, though I've been there for lunch and late-night drinks as well.

Once, not long after the masterful Purple One passed away, I went and drowned some sorrows in a glass of wine.  They had an amateur band playing upstairs who did a somewhat odd cover of a Prince song as a tribute. 

Nice touch to have live music on weekends, but 1) they merit higher-quality performers, and 2) I wish they'd soften the lighting or fancy-up the second floor. It seemed a bit \"unfinished\" when I was there, particularly compared to the ground floor that is so finely attuned to the stated theme of the restaurant.

Interesting decor, and a really cool chandelier that graces the area near the entrance."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and would definitely recommend going there for that. The reason I give it 3 stars is because the wait staff was sub-par. It took them forever to take our orders and never came back when we wanted to order more drinks. And when we finally flagged our waitress down, she only took half the orders before she ran away (we were still waiting to give her the rest!!)."}
{"text":"Went to this bar/restaurant tonight and was really excited to find it even better than expected.  Ambiance is great, a real legacy to Pgh's industrial past, staff (and owner) were very friendly and very professional. I'm fussy about my pierogies and theirs were the best I've had at a restaurant.  Great beer selection, both on tap and in bottles w/a nice variety of local options.  Dinner was good and inexpensive, overall, a terrific experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try Dorothy 6 becausw we had heard great reviews. We went into lunch ans were the only ones there. Our server sat us and then helped us select something we mighr like. We had a fantastic meal with to go boxes as we had plenty if food. Really good selections and a nice atmosphere, definitely will go again. Just a side note they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays"}
{"text":"First bad review.  We wanted to really love this place but the circumstance, service/food, would not allow.  So what happened? Well, service started out great and first round of drinks were quick.  Then approximately one hour later we were still without food and had no follow-up drinks or visits from our waitress.  When we finally received our food, three out of three burgers were overcooked and even after letting the waitress know, nothing was done to fix this. The waitress asked how the food was and even said sorry for your bad experience, but did not help fix the experience.  First and last visit, food and service were worse than Applebee's with a higher bill.  Love the decor and wish it could have been better."}
{"text":"The Reuben with a side of Brussel sprouts was superb! My partner was less impressed with his stuffed meatball sandwich, but the fries alongside it were thick cut, hot, and very tasty. 

I got the gin cocktail with the pickled ginger, which I was very excited about, but it was disappointing. The drink didn't have any cucumbers, ginger, or anything else in it....it must have just been muddled together and then strained. I would have preferred pieces of ginger and cucumber to remain in the drink. Overall, it was bland and didn't have the spicy kick I love with ginger cocktails. 

Definitely go for the Reuben and Brussel sprouts, though! That meal, especially at $10, is well worth the visit. My partner deemed it the best Reuben he's ever had."}
{"text":"First time here and came for brunch. Food, atmosphere and service is excellent. If you pass by this place then it's a must stop. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Well this place sucks. 
1. Small menu
2. Expensive 
3. Takes hour and a half for a meal on a slow night
4. Medium rare is not an option unless you really meant well done
5. Waitress/waitor disappear 
6. Haven't got my check yet but I know I am going to feel violated once I get it. 
7. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great selection, and an amazing line up of beers and wines. You simply can't go wrong at Dorothy 6!  The place had a very nice, adult atmosphere and was easily accessible."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, price was cheap, server and staff were attentive, and atmosphere reminded me of downtown Brooklyn; it was a great experience! 

So why four stars and not five? It took quite a long time to get our food. To the tune of 20 minutes to get our appetizer. The bar was quite busy, but the tables were average; I guess the slow food service can be attributed to the fact the servers (and kitchen) is working for both the bar and tables, but it was beyond average wait.

Overall, we would definitely come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you are looking through the reviews for Dorothy 6, seeing the mix of 1-2's and 4-5's and wondering why there is such a mix of opinions.  After taking my boyfriend, Dale, to Dorothy 6 for his birthday last night, here is my insight:

Food & drinks:  5 stars
Value/Affordability:  5 stars
Atmosphere:  4 stars
Service:  1 star

The food and cocktails were wonderful.  We started with the Spinach & Artichoke Bruschetta, which was fantastic - topped with goat cheese, balsamic, bacon...mmm bacon is a key ingredient at Dorothy 6!  We followed the appetizer with the Crispy Chicken Parmesan for me, Dorothy Flat Iron Steak for him.  The breading on the chicken was delicious, as was the marinara sauce and pasta.  Dale ordered his steak rare, and it came out perfectly done.  He subbed in the brussel sprouts for the veggies that typically come with the flat iron steak, and what a great decision that was - topped with bacon and deliciousness.  To accompany our food, we each had an Old Fashioned, which were well made.  Dale also had a draft (the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout - a great beer from the restaurant's reasonably diverse offering of drafts) and I had a Smokestack Martini (dessert in a glass) to round out our evening.

The atmosphere is good.  It seems like the restaurant hasn't fully decided \"what it is\" yet, as there is a little bit of a clash between the cool brick walls and art, the fun chandeliers, and the kind of cheap banquet hall-style chairs and tables.  I suspect that as the restaurant develops, the style and atmosphere will evolve further.

The pricing is very affordable.  Our bill came to about $75 - for an appetizer, two entrees, three craft cocktails, and a decent beer, it doesn't get much better than that.

Here's why you see the 1-2 star reviews:  The service is abysmal.  The restaurant was not busy while we were there, but the wait staff was not attentive.  It took a long time just to get water after we were seated.  When our food eventually came out, we ultimately grabbed sets of silverware from a nearby table as we did not have any and our waitress didn't return to our table for another 10 minutes or so. Asking for additional water for another drink throughout our meal was a challenge, as our waitress returned our table very infrequently and spent a lot of time with her back turned to us, talking to the bartender.  I think next time we will sit at the bar in hopes of better service.  

If you are not in a hurry - perhaps you're looking for a place to relax and eat a good meal or have some cocktails after some time in the Waterfront, I would highly recommend Dorothy 6.  However, if you have a deadline (e.g., if you are planning to see a movie within the next hour at the theater), I would probably choose another place.  

Overall though - let's revisit how awesome the food and drinks were.  The food truly was outstanding, the cocktails were well made, and the prices were very affordable.  If Dorothy 6 improves on service, this could easily be a 5 star restaurant.  It is a great addition to Homestead, and I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great drinks and good steaks. I do wish the menu was a bit bigger or features a few cheaper options like sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a solid beer selection and the delicious cocktails that aren't overpriced. We've been here twice, and everything we've tried here has been great. The Brussels sprouts are chopped and perfectly fine. The pierogis and French onion soup were tasty, and the strip steak and burgers were all prepared as desired. I love that they give you warm multi-grain bread with butter too. The restaurant has a casual feel, but you can get a good steak here too. The service is always delightful. It is our favorite place to eat in Homestead. I am looking forward to coming back here for brunch sometime."}
{"text":"I don't think it is unreasonable when it takes over an hour and a half to get your food on a Saturday for four I would say it would only be appropriate to ask for the manager.  When the manager approached our table he introduced himself as the manager.  Then I proceeded to say it took over an hour and a half to get our food.  His response, You came at the busiest time of the night.  Well I got news for you, it won't be that way with his attitude, management and comment.  I said, \"that is not my problem,\" that's yours.  He immediately left our table and walked away.  Never said I'm sorry, can I get a round for your trouble, nothing.  Won't be back!  I would suggest hiring a new manager!"}
{"text":"This place gives me such conflicted feelings. If I were rating it on the food alone, it would have been a 5 star place for sure. Even the bread with butter.. the butter is whipped with honey and it pairs well with the warm bread. I would buy it by the gallon if I could. We ordered the cheddar pierogies as an appetizer. They had a nice peppery kick and were perfectly cooked, served with a side of herbed sour cream. Our appetizers, the meatloaf and the crab cakes, were delicious. 

I took away two stars due to the ambience. This place doesn't know whether it wants to be fancy or your neighborhood bar. The beautiful chandelier when you walk in is a nice touch alongside the more rustic elements... but I could have done without the jukebox blaring Creed and Ke$ha for the entirety of our meal. 

Other notes: decent beer selection, servers were really nice but the kitchen was slow."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. I attended a group dinner the other night to find the restaurant not prepared. Service was terrible. Bartender did not seem engaged. Ice on sidewalks not cleared. Do not bother with this place."}
{"text":"Dorothy 6 Café is a great restaurant! Our food was delicious, as was the complimentary bread and butter. We sat outside on the patio, which is located in-between two historical buildings, one covered in climbing ivy, which is beautiful! Our waitress and host were both wonderful, and very kind. The reason I'm giving Dorothy 6 only four stars is the price of the food. My Crispy Chicken Parmesan was $17. It was not worth the cost. Dorothy 6 is a great restaurant though, definitely one of the best options in the area. Give it a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for quite sometime.  I work in Homestead and drive by frequently and was tickled to see the \"Open\" sign lit up in the window a few weeks back.  

Last night, I accompanied my mom to dinner here and was delighted the moment I walked in the door.  The ambiance has a mixed feel of comfort and flash.  The warm greeting we were given by the bartender set the best tone.  Taking in the large glittering crystal chandelier above, contrasted with the bare bones brick walls was a great touch.  It felt warm, inviting, and still hip enough to make me want to return.  We discovered they just had their grand opening last night.  

If comfort food is their goal, they reached it.  I like fine dining, but also enjoy the staples - and again - Dorothy 6 seemed to mix the two.  We split a large beet and arugula salad and was the kitchen obliged by plating it beautifully on two separate dishes for us - with no extra charge or fuss.  I wish I had taken a picture, because it was presented so nicely.  Sliced beets gave the foundation to a mountain of arugula, dried cranberries, and sliced toasted almonds.  I chose the 8 oz strip with bacon brussels and mashed potatoes, mom had the salmon croquettes with the fall vegetable hash.  My strip steak was juicy, and prepared perfectly rare.  The brussels were also great, and my mouth watered with the flavors of bacon interspersed in the veggies.  The mashed potatoes seemed a bit flat though, and I had to add salt, and they could have been a bit more savory for my palate.  But in all, it was a perfectly comforting dish.  Mom really enjoyed the salmon croquettes and made a comment about the colorful display of the veggie hash.  

We did NOT have room for the dessert - apple pie was offered by the very friendly wait staff - but I think I will be back to sample that at another time. 

The service was very attentive, friendly, jovial, and knowledgeable.   I ordered a Moscow Mule cocktail, and asked it to be returned to add a splash more ginger beer, and they chided the bartender playfully about it.  The wine selection was just enough...sometimes restaurants can get a bit too much with their choices, and the array was diverse enough to give us options, but not overwhelming to the point where we had to take a half hour to study it.  

In all, I was very pleased by the experience as was my mom who said she was shocked such a place existed in Homestead.  I am thrilled to see more locally owned establishments coming into this area!!  Its a welcome break from the flash of the big chain eateries across the tracks.  I will indeed return, and also tell my coworkers and friends to visit as well."}
{"text":"Great spot for a delicious lunch or dinner! Homemade food which is amazing and there is never a wait. If you are shopping in the waterfront and are looking for something better than all the chain crap, then head over a few blocks to this wonderful eatery."}
{"text":"Went to dorthy 6 last night and had a wonderful experience food was great drinks were awesome and staff was super friendly! I will be back ASAP!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! The salmon sandwich was the best I have ever had, and the meatball appetizer has me making plans to be back for the sandwich. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Will return for the food but Rachel, our bartender, was awesome. Been waiting to step foot inside because homestead isn't on the top of anyone's list but I pass thru often and finally got a night away from kids to enjoy with the wife.  The artistry and atmosphere is what really captures you besides the numerous rotating taps, good looking menu, and helpful staff.  We will surely return to try the food soon."}
{"text":"You don't always think of going to Homestead when picking a dining spot but they do have some hidden gems-Dorothy 6 being one of them. You step inside and look up to see a magnificent crystal chandelier.  Our group went for Sunday brunch and were pretty much the only ones there.  The service was so so and it took a long time to get our orders taken, food delivered, and checks handed out.  The bloody marys they have looked tasty and there is also a very nice draft list. The menu prices are very reasonable and they have a nice mixture of sweet and savory options.  I usually stick with the sweet and was not disappointed by their amazing chocolate zucchini bread French toast served with strawberries and whipped cream. It was tremendous and my only complaint is the portion was small and I left still hungry.  Others in my party ordered the eggs benedict which came with two very small pieces and no sides.  I would consider going back to try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm very excited that all these new places are opening in Homestead! I'm so excited to try them all. Recently my husband and I ventured to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace on a down night. The restaurant only opened in November. We'd read the reviews the restaurant had gotten already and figured it was worth a try.

The interior of the restaurant is really nice. Brick walls with a steel mill theme. There's even a guide to warning whistles behind the bar. There's also a gorgeous chandelier in the entrance. The space has two levels, although they're currently only serving on one. I'm guessing as they begin to get more service they'll expand to the second level. 

We got the jalapeno pirogies as an appetizer. They were delicious. I'm not even a HUG pirogie fan. I usually find them to be a little too buttery/greasy...but these were perfect. They still had that comfort food deliciousness but weren't laden with butter.

For dinner I had the meatball sandwich. It was very good. The meatballs are actually stuffed with cheese and spices, and I really enjoyed the marinara they use on the sandwich. All sandwiches come with steak fries. They're on the softer side, which I like but I know a lot of people aren't big fans of. My husband got the steak. He said it was good, but he could tell it had been sitting for awhile.

It did take us a little longer than expected to be served our entrees...almost an hour (reason for 3 stars instead of 4). You can definitely tell they're a new restaurant when it comes to service. Everyone is very nice, but it seems they aren't up par yet as far as checking on tables and getting meals out. However I know these are growing pains that come with opening up a new place. 

The food definitely makes this place worth the visit. I'm looking forward to stopping back in the future once they've established themselves a bit more."}
{"text":"Truth - if it wasn't for a dinner event I would have never visited this space. Fortunately I met a group of friends here and was pleasantly surprised at how unique the space is. 

You'll feel the artsy vibe as soon as you walk in the door. The art work, brick and huge chandelier tie the whole place together. 

We were the only party in the upstairs loft space. Plus side, we had the entire thing to ourselves. Downside, service was super slow and not attentive at all. After placing our orders our server told us they were out of several things. We reordered and then waited.... we chatted the entire time so I hardly noticed how long it was taking until one of our group members brought it up. When our orders did arrive several items were incorrect. We waited so long we didn't care so we ate everything. 

I really wanted to love this space, but the service was so low and most of our orders were wrong. I can't see myself going out of the way to visit again."}
{"text":"We made reservations online at 9:30am for 5:30pm this evening. We arrived at Dorothy 6 and they inform us that we are not on the reservation list. The place is not crowded. The hostess barely speaks or tries to solve the problem. She simply ignores us. She does not respond to our questions or gives any apology. Would not recommend this place for the fact that they hire people that do not have he qualities needed to work with the public. It would have been nice if she would have offered to have the manager speak with us or even acknowledge that we were feeling ignored. Not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Cool spot with really good food. If you haven't checked out the patio this summer - it's a must! I have dined here twice now and the food has been consistently great. I would recommend the pirogies, the crab dip and the crab cakes. My husband had the Ruben and loved it. They have a pretty extensive craft draft list which we loved. The complimentary bread basket is a nice touch. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a blast at Dorothy's its very sophisticated.. I also enjoyed my food, my bartender & my Carmel apple martini.. I'm currently putting a gathering together just to get back for that meatloaf that's described to die for...I mean this hidden jewel in the middle of homestead which I've visited there frequently never stumbled across this well lit extremely clean setting!! 
Looking forward to my next visit!."}
{"text":"We were going out after some drinking and needed good food to sober us up a little. Dorothy 6 was just that! The waitress was amazing and so was the food. I had the corn chowder and pierogies. Corn chowder was really tasty and full of veggies. The pierogies I got were the jalapeno ones and MAN were they spicy!!! I think between the table we got at least one of each app and they were all amazing! I really like this place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for several months now from positive word of mouth. Fresh ingredients, cool atmosphere, hand made pierogies- enough said! Yesterday was my first visit and the service and food was nothing short of great. I ordered a Thirsty Dog 12 Dog's of Xmas Ale (very delicious) at only $2. They offer a decent list of specials in addition to roughly 25 beers on draft, a rotating craft bottle selection, and a lengthy wine list.

On the food front: I ordered their in house made peirogies as an appetizer; a sampler of beer bacon, chedder, and japlepeno fillings. The sandwich selection all looked promising and I settled on the reuben as per sever recommendation. The beef is corned in house- a perfect blend of thickness and tenderness, not stringy at all. The house fries were a bit lack luster; the only food item that left me undersatisfied. 

The atmosphere is relaxed and modern, with an industrial meets classy feel. The dining space is cozy and the bar seemed very inviting. I also noticed an upstairs, unsure of what it offers. I didn't notice any TV's.

If you're looking for a quick, high quality meal at a fair price close to the Waterfront I would definitely stop here."}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far, and the food has been excellent. Especially enjoyed the steak and lobster when they had it as a special. As a bonus, they also have a good beer selection. Nice ambience, both inside and out. The service is superb! No complaints. I hope this place does well."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised with this place and will definitely return! Everything I had was great. The mozzarella stuffed meatballs and the scallop special were so tasty. Highlight was the spinach artichoke flatbread appetizer though. It was so delicious and different. Also, everyone who was ordering burgers was making me jealous because they looked so good I wanted to try one. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.  Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"Good service, yummy food. The brussel sprouts were pretty awesome (can't say I've ever said that that about brussel sprouts before!) The pierogies weren't the best I've ever had, but they hit the spot. Hubby had salmon and fingerling potatoes and enjoyed them. I also had the French onion soup--one of the best I've ever tasted (though it had a bay leaf still floating in it). Also--the cherry hard cider is excellent.

I'd eat here again and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I reviewed this restaurant over a year ago and I would like to update my opinion.  At that time I found the service slow. Now I don't have any complaints about anything.  The space is really comfortable. The owners did a really great job decorating the bar.  It is worth a trip to see how they designed the bar area as a tribute to the areas steel history. Now for the important features of this bar restaurant. They have a great rotating craft beer selection on tap. The menu is not huge but representative towards most tastes. The crab cakes and meatloaf come to mind. My wife and I are small eaters and we usually get a small beet salad with a piece of salmon on top. For ten bucks you'll not find a better salad of mixed greens and yellow and red beets. I don't who their fish supplier is but we have never got a better piece of salmon anywhere. We try to visit at least every three weeks."}
{"text":"This Café includes a super nice outdoor patio with string lights and a wall of ivy on the building next door.  It's nice place to grab a beer and enjoy the evening in the walled off courtyard.  We tried the Reuben and the Meatloaf for dinner.  I really liked the Reuben and the fries were done nicely.  The meatloaf could easily serve two - it's a huge chunk of meaty goodness a little heavy on the garlic but enjoyable nonetheless.  Our server, Nicole, was very nice and kept up with our needs by stopping by every so often.  The Café is a nice addition to the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place, its food, and the atmosphere!

One of my favorite dishes here is their perogies - especially the jalapeño ones.  

They have good drinks here, too. I personally loved the Cider. 

Service has been great each time I've been here, as well. 

Highly suggest this place if you're in Pittsburgh and wanting to try a new/trendy place instead of a local vibe type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner I had here last night. Great Perogies and Spinach Artichoke Bruschetta. Moderately priced and the service was good. No issues. I don't live in the area but I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this little gem on a Sunday looking for a nice brunch. It happened to be their first day with Sunday brunch and man did they nail it. Limited options but everything we had was great so it didn't matter. Potato pancake benedict was done to perfection. Will venture back for dinner and drinks soon!"}
{"text":"Not often I give feedback, but feel compelled. Went here last Sat night with friends. Very cool atmosphere. Bar was great, pretty decent beer list. Food was fantastic! Shared the jalapeño perogies..yummy!  Ordered the salmon sandwich for dinner..it was delicious! Everyone had a great meal. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The perogies were done with just the right amount of crispy on each side and good spicy on the inside. 
The salmon was different but had enough flavor without being overwhelming. I would get it again.
I'm not into a lot of beer but it had a nice craft variety to choose from. Love the rogue dead guy!"}
{"text":"Pittsburghs worst restaurant.   I will not bore you with all the details that go along with a bad review because it is obvious that is all related to poor service, food and pricing.  In which Dorothy Six rises to failure in epic proportions.  First of all don't kid yourself homestead 8th Ave is not even close to being the  next Lawrenceville  renovation.   This by no means is a safe area not by day  and most definitely not by night.  THIS IS ONE RESTAURANT TO AVOID ...  I would expect all the good reviews are from friends and family.  Cross this place off your list."}
{"text":"Fun little spot with good food. Slow service that needs to be improved. But still worth it. Just need to speed up the kitchen."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is delicious! Potato pancakes are the best I've had and the bacon is cooked to perfection! Great service and a great Bloody Mary! The waitress was attentive and friendly even though she was the only one working at the time."}
{"text":"This place finally opened! Have been waiting for quite some time. They were still in soft opening stage, but had most everything together. 

Atmosphere: Gorgeous. Industrial feel with a warmth that a blast furnace would give. Minimalist decor with the light fixtures being the attractions and they are varied in style. Plus...OUTDOOR SEATING.  Such a rare commodity in Pittsburgh. Three TVs which is plenty...if I want to watch a game, I'm going to a sports bar. I don't want this place to be that...should be a chill place to drink, converse and relax. Touch tunes juke box. 

Drink: Great tap selection and bottles, too. Also a pretty extensive and eclectic liquor choice and just the right amount of wine. I like the display of it mixed through on the large gears on the wall. 

Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was great to offer suggestions, tastes and take notes of what we like to drink. 

Food: Tried the spinach artichoke bruschetta. This was really good. Good twist on the all-party appetizer that wasn't too salty. Reuben balls were pretty damn good. Stuffed meatballs were okay...a little overdone, but I imagine they could easily be if you have to make them ahead and keep warm. Not crazy about the marinara with it. I know they'll be playing with the menu a bit.  I hope it stays simple. You don't need a lot of choices, just really good ones. 

Overall....this is probably going to be my new hangout. I want this place to make it. 8th avenue needs it and Homestead does, too. Tell your friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for brunch and it was good but I thought the pricing was a little inconsistent.  Fro $8.00, my husband got 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, an excellent marble rye toast and sausage.  For $10.00, I got 2 small potato pancakes topped with two slightly overdone poached eggs with a small amount of hollandaise sauce (the included sausage patty I ordered on the side for my husband to eat since I'm a vegetarian. )
While everything tasted good (and I am someone who is turned off by huge portions), my husband had a large platter of food for the price while mine was a quite small breakfast.  Fortunately, my husband shared his rye toast with me so I left feeling pleasantly full.  (Shouldn't potato pancake Benedict come with one piece of toast?)
I would probably return if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.  A bonus was that it's in the same block as Annex Cookery so I was able to pick up a kitchen utensil that I've wanted to try (they also have an adorable selection of kitchen clocks!)"}
{"text":"I didn't read the reviews for Dorothy 6 (I mainly glanced at the pictures) so I guess I can take some of the blame for deciding to check out their dinner menu two hours before a movie was scheduled for my group. Long story short- We were seated, waited a bit for drinks, waited a bit to order, and then saw our server once to order another drink, the check, and more bread (because we were panicking and starving due to not having any food brought to our table in the hour and a half we had been sitting there.) We also all ran out of water. Womp womp womp. 

We eventually got the food, but also arrived to the theater so late that we had to get our prepaid tickets exchanged for a later showing. So that was annoying, but partially my fault for taking us to the restaurant and assuming it would take under two hours to get food and eat :/ 

I think they need to hire another server. Or develop a different system. Or I just can't go to Dorothy 6 if I have something planned afterward.

But anyway- Whatever flavor making is going on in the kitchen is on point. The bruschetta was amazing. The crab cakes were actual crab and the hash that came with was delightful. My friends seemed to like their dinner and the breakfast food I've had there has been good as well. The only issue I've ever had with the food is that the portion sizes have been on the smaller side. 

I like Dorothy 6 and will hopefully make it back to the restaurant again soon, but I definitely won't do it if I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Well, here it goes, my first (almost) completely negative review. My server, Howard, completely ruined my evening there for my date and i. We were sat and then were not greeted for 20 minutes... Howard came by brought waters; no questions on drinks what food or anything, just said \"sorry bout that. Are you ready?\" They were obviously understaffed but the few staff they did have were terribly unpleasant. Usually not the type to complain... & don't get me wrong the bruschetta was delicious (even though i originally asked for  spinach & artichoke dip), but my \"medium well\" burger came out crisp and completely well done. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"Not that great for a friday night!the place is all mute.Their menu doesn't have any good listings!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really great. It was refreshing to find such a trendy place in this area. The service was quick but could be more knowledgable on their drinks and food. The chef nailed it! I got the special; crab stuffed salmon on tomato risotto with lemon drizzled green beans. It was full of flavor. My party of four all really enjoyed their time and food! Pretty nice selection of drafts to chose from as well!"}
{"text":"Homestead is trying.  It really is, but it not yet there (there was an orange liquor license in a window so that shows promise).  The Waterfront is a great shopping area, but it lacking in the restaurant vibe (chain, chain, chain).  Head a few block over the train tracks to a little street called 8th Ave.  There is a quaint eatery called Dorothy 6.  The interior is unassuming with little relics of the steel industry placed throughout:  the tap handles, the small framed art.  Look around and there is some real history there. Industrial and hip meet and make a great pair.  Don't overlook the great patio in the warm days.

We started with the pierogies.  My advice, just get the jalapeno for all three, they have just the right amount of kick...a little zing at the end but nothing too spicy.  We ordered the Firehouse Burger, the Meatloaf and a side of Brussel sprouts.  All had great tastes and the gravy on my meatloaf could have been poured all over my plate.  What a great flavor.  

The best part about the evening was the service.  Prompt, kind, (but not fake).  Our food was timed perfectly and drinks were made with the quickness.  (A pretty stellar beer list, I might add)"}
{"text":"My sister found this place to have an early dinner after  my niece's graduation from Duquesne and we loved it!  Outdoor patio was beautiful and the staff was awesome and attentive!  The food was all around amazing.. Our party of 11 tried everything from the burgers,brussel sprouts, strip steaks and pierogies and we loved everything!  Would love to come again! Pineapple  Mule was delicious and lots of good beers on tap or in the bottle."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and choice of music. The flat iron steak was excellent, joined by delicious Brussels sprouts and acceptable mashed potatoes. Our friend had the burger and is willing to come back, so it must have been good. It was accompanied by ample steak fries. They take reservations, a plus. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"I don't like flowery, long winded, pretentious reviews by hipster wannabe food critics so I'll get to the brass tacks.

Ambiance: decor and music was perfect
Booze: great selection of beer and cocktails
Food: I had an 8oz strip steak with mashed potatoes and caramelized baconized Brussels sprouts. I ordered my steak med-rare and it was tender and delicious but a little more on the medium side but really that was okay with me, the Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly--firm and not squishy but they could've used a little salt, there was something kind of off about the mashed potatoes though, they sort of reminded me of the ones I had in my high school cafeteria but my husband loved them. My husband had the pierogies, also with the Brussels sprouts and they were awesome! Like the best pierogies I've ever had, actually. 
Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and attentive, I saw him creating custom cocktails for other patrons and if I had not already been drinking beer I probably would've asked him to make me one. I feel that if I had been upset about the steak being a teensy bit overcooked and not liking the mashed pots, he would've done something about it cheerfully. 

Overall, the experience was pleasant and any kinks are small and will be smoothed out over a bit of time, I'm so excited that they've opened in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Any second now, Homestead is going to take off. I swear it. And I hope Dorothy 6 is still around when it does. Sunday brunch was very quiet, but I'm hopeful business will pick up! The host was exceptionally friendly as I waited for my party of 6 to arrive. We were seated right away and tended to by a nice server. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Crab and it was wonderful. The remainder of our crew ordered a combination of the house specialty Triple Chocolate Zucchini Bread French Toast and the Potato Pancake Eggs Benedict. Everything looked incredible and everyone left very happy and satisified. Checks and drink refills took awhile, but we weren't in a huge hurry, so that's forgiven. Also - I recommend opening a window for some fresh air - it smelled a bit of cleaning fluid (again, not a huge deal, but worth mentioning). At an average of $10/entrée or less, Dorothy 6 is one of the more reasonable brunch deals in town!"}
{"text":"Brunch was very good at the Blast Furnace. Ordered the potato pancake eggs Benedict with crab and an order of bacon. Excellent combo choice and eggs were cooked perfectly. We Also ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast. Also very tasty choice. It was busy but no problem getting seated quickly. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"We came here for Brunch this past Sunday.  Dorothy's has been one of those places I have been wanting to try for some time now, but we just honestly don't make too many trips to Homestead.  The brunch menu caught my eye and I am happy we tried it.  

We sat in the downstairs bar area at a high top.  Our servers were the two lady bartenders.  Once seated we received menus right away, but it took our waitress a little longer than expected to return for drink orders, especially since the menu is one page.  I went with the Hail Mary while my husband was feeling some tequila sunrise.  The Bloody was one of the tastiest ones I have had in a while.  The house made mix was a perfect balance of citrus and spice and they garnish the drink well.  I really enjoyed my drink.  

After our drinks were delivered we ordered our entrées.   I went with the eggs benedict with crab, and Matt decided on the potato pancake eggs benedict with bacon.  We kicked back and continued to enjoy our drinks until our food arrived.  I felt the time between ordering and receiving for food and drinks was a tad on the excessive side, but both waitresses were wonderful and very helpful when they did make it to our table.  We had completed both our drinks before our food was served, so we waited a bit to order another.  I went with an Irish coffee.  I was a bit disappointed in my Irish coffee as it only had Jamison in it.  I am used to ordering Irish coffee's that come with Jamison, Bailey's and whipped cream.  Now after I ordered I asked for no whipped cream, but I guess their idea of an Irish coffee is whisky and black coffee.  It will put hair on your chest!  Lesson learn, always ask never assume.  I added a decent amount of cream to make it drinkable and our food arrived.

My eggs benedict were delicious, and I am so happy I went with the crab.  If I had to make one comment it was that the one egg was slightly over to medium hard poach and I missed that yummy egg yolk flow over my English muffin.   Everything was seasoned wonderfully and they potatoes that accompanied my meal were quite nice.  My portion was perfect for me but for my husband seemed to be a little on the smaller side.  You may want to think about ordering some additional sides to accompany your dish depending on your order.  We would definitely return for brunch and maybe dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. The service was good but wasn't as attentive as they could have been. The jazz player was amazing. The food was delicious but it wasn't a big portion for the price."}
{"text":"Really solid choice for the Waterfront area. The atmosphere is great, there is a huge chandelier in the entrance way which is gorgeous and the whole place has a very comfortable feeling. We both enjoyed our meals, I got the cheaper steak dinner which was good and came with large side portions of mashed potatoes and some amazingly brussels. My companion ordered a sandwich which was also tasty.  I especially enjoyed my cocktail...it was balanced, strong and priced well. I would probably come back here just to drink.  Service was fine and the waitress was pleasant and paced the meal well. 

The food and drink here aren't ground breaking but I really enjoyed my meal and the quality is superior over the other crummy Waterfront chains available to diners in this area. Parking was easy to find on the street but bring quarters as Homestead doesn't have the electronic machines yet."}
{"text":"All the food here is amazing. I hear the drinks are, too. My favorite thing to eat is the bruschetta. I can't go there and NOT get it. Staff is always nice, and it's a cool place to come in and chill"}
{"text":"I came here a few weekends ago with the other half and Josh. I had heard good thing about the place from other yelpers and I was excited to enjoy a beer and warm meal. 

I started off with a Moscow Mule. I had to feed my ginger addiction. I found it crisp and refreshing. For my meal I went with perogies and brussel sprouts. The perogies were very good. Something I could see myself craving in the future. I enjoyed the sprouts but wish they were cooked a bit longer. I also had a coffee porter that was perfect with my meal. Service was ok. I wish the waitress was a little more present. Drinks sat empty from time to time but no one was dying of thirst. 


 The decor seemed a little hodgepodge. I love the chandelier when you first walk in. I'm sure it cost a pretty penny. Over all a nice evening."}
{"text":"Three strikes, it's out for me.

The first time I came, I was with a big party and the wait for food was over 40 minutes. Since we were with a bigger party, I was completely understanding. The second time I visited, my boyfriend and I had dinner here. Again, longer wait, and I was a little annoyed at that point. However, when I saw a Facebook notification for their \"Jazzy Christmas Eve Brunch\", I thought it sounded wonderful and that we should give them one more try. I made our reservation for 1:00 pm, however, due to the nature of the busy Christmas holiday, I called around 11:00 am that morning to see if there was any possibility that we could arrive earlier. The woman on the phone was hesitant (although she did not explain why) but told us we could arrive at 12:15. We arrived a little early, as it literally only takes us around 6 minutes to drive here from our house. It wasn't that busy and we were sat right away and ordered our meals by 12:13. The jazz musician was wonderful- very friendly and he played wonderful music. Had it not been for him we wouldn't have been able to wait the 50 minutes it took for our food to come out. Again, the place wasn't that busy. I ordered a typical breakfast- two eggs, white toast, home fries, and turkey sausage. Brendan ordered the Eggs Benedict with home fries. We also both ordered drinks- Brendan had iced coffee (which tasted old) and I had a bloody mary (not bad- but nothing special at all- completely opposite of how the drink menu describes it). Now, it's not just the wait that is frustrating. If I had to wait 50 minutes for the best meal of my life, or close to it, ok. But waiting for 50 minutes for less than average food is a waste of time. The portion of home fries Brendan received was embarrassing- maybe 10 little pieces of fried potatoes. It looked like they were just dropped into a deep fryer, they were dry and there was no veggies like peppers or onions with them. The Eggs Benedict was even more embarrassing. I wish I had taken a photo, but frankly we were starving by the time our food came out and we were too disappointed in our experience to take a photo. The Eggs Benedict was served on English muffins- tiny piece of ham on each one, over done poached egg and barely any hollandaise sauce. It was the poorest excuse for Eggs Benedict that I have ever seen. My breakfast was below average as well- the white bread was so incredibly dry that I didn't even want to eat it, the home fries were bland and dry, the sausage was fine though and my over easy eggs were cooked correctly. We just wanted to get out of there, but I decided to talk to our server and inquire about the wait. The server was obviously disappointed in the establishment and informed me that this is a reoccurring problem. The kitchen here is too small to serve a large amount of people, yet the managers insist on booking many reservations. The result is incredibly long wait times on food and food not being prepared the way it should be. The server was great and attentive the entire time, as much as she could be, as she also had a table upstairs. Not one aspect of our below average experience has to do with the service we received. After paying, I decided to speak with a manager to express my disappointment in our visit. I talked about the 50 minute wait time, and the below average food. The manager was not surprised at the wait at all, and mentioned their small kitchen problem. I informed him that this should not be a reoccurring issue and should be taken as a learning experience for the restaurant. Especially on a holiday weekend, people should be warned about the long wait time before making a reservation or even being seated. Speaking to the manager did not change my feelings about this place at all. 

I really love the new business scene in Homestead and do my best to support these businesses as often as I can. However, I will not waste my time and come to Dorothy 6 again."}
{"text":"Wow - we  been here twice now and we are very impressed.  Great vibe, good cocktails (great bartender - Bill) and the food is awesome.  We have had the pierogies, meatballs, and salmon cakes.  Very good - fresh and homemade.  The last time we were there Bill talked me into getting the Surf and Turf and boy am I glad he did.  It was just outstanding!  Great filet and the lobster was perfectly cooked.  This is our new local \"go-to\" place.  Love it!  Thanks"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. It is fresh and homemade, which is great for a casual place like this. The service was also very good...server was super friendly and attentive and everything came out quickly. 

The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the prices. It was almost $50 for 2 entrees and a cup of soup. No drinks, no dessert, no alcohol. For a casual bar/restaurant their prices are about 25% too high, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Exposed brick. Chandeliers. Craft brew. All in an abandoned warehouse setting. This is as hipster and trendy as you could get. Wide variety of food and appetizers. They specialize in their handmade pierogis which were excellent. They. Also have a variety of hamburgers that are excellent as well. They did screw up my wife's order so I can't give five stars for that. We will be back even though it was a little bit of a pain to get there during rush hour traffic over the homestead bridge."}
{"text":"TLDR:  potentially cool. Not ready for prime time yet. Owner hates money apparently. Come here in a few months maybe if they can unscrew themselves. 

Review: 

They get two stars for effort for being in an area that could be so cool and desperately needs some innovative businesses. 

Sadly, not yet ready for prime time. 

I stopped here with The Wife after Mandatory Shopping. We were looking forward to what we had heard was a new and dynamic eatery. 

We walked in. The hostess lady sat us outdoors.

Then three millennia and a couple major client changing  environmental events happened. During this time we never once saw what appeared to be the single server. I told The Wife we should have sat at the bar. 

This place has an intriguing menu and a couple decent sounding cocktails. I have no clue what they taste like because after we were seated NO ONE EVER SPOKE TO US AGAIN. 

We waited twenty minutes without any contact, beverages or anything. The single sever is single minded. She went to one table and talked to them. Then she went inside. The she delivered something to the table. Then she went inside. Then she came out and talked to another table. Then she went inside and a few minutes later brought that table whatever they discussed. Rinse and repeat. 

The hostess lady who I think may be one of the owners did nothing this entire time except talk to the bartender. No other customers came in. 

She couldn't be bothered to actually talk or do anything with a customer other than seat them. 

I got the impression that these were people who ran a shot and a beer bar for the horribly depressed and desperate when this section of town was at it lowest economic point. 

When we eventually got tired and hungry and thirsty enough to leave we walked out and realized that the single sever was being tasked with taking care of the interior first floor, second floor, an outside courtyard while hostess lady did squat. 

Maybe if they get enough bad Yelp reviews and find someone to sound out the words in the review for them the owners and managers will unscrew themselves. 

In the meantime I sat for twenty minutes and sampled nothing and gave them zero money. 

People like this are why everything we buy these days is made in China. Gross American incompetence and laziness. 

These people make me sad."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed  our waitress was trying so hard but the bar/ kitchen couldn't keep up and the manager  was  busy avoiding us or being unkind to patrons and staff.@  
6 o'clock reservation drinks/ apps took over an hour and no food till 8:40 . They asked if we had show tickets and knew the show was at 8. One entree was 8 minutes later than the rest.
Some food hot some cold. 
My second drink never arrived. One drink served in a broken glass ."}
{"text":"A new Homestead favorite!   We made a reservation, but decided on a different movie and showed up early to make that work.  They were friendly and accommodating, seating us right away and adjusting an errant spotlight that was pointed right at my head.   

Service was great all the way through.  Drinks came promptly and she offered samples as needed.   She even came around and asked if we wanted another round before happy hour ended.   

Food was great as well, though I'd definitely have ordered differently if I'd know how big the portions were.   We started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs.  They were good on their own, but the side of sauce really finished the dish - could have used a bit more of that.   The boyfriend ordered the meatloaf and loved it. The gravy was a reduced French onion, which was really good, though we both wanted to experiment with the meatball sauce.   I ordered the pierogi dinner.   After the appetizer and a glass (or two) of wine, I actually struggled to finish it - the portions are decent sized.   I'd either skip the app next time or order the smaller plate of pierogis.  I sampled all three varieties of pierogi.  Cheddar was the best, followed closely by jalapeno.  The beer one was my least favorite, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste.   I'd order the other two again as well as the brussels, which were very good.  

A little pricey for Homestead, but the food and service stood up, so I didn't deduct a star."}
{"text":"21/2 Hours . . That's how long it took from the time we placed our order until we actually received our dinner!!

NOT TO!"}
{"text":"Made reservations online the day before for 6 for Saturday evening.  When we arrived they claimed to not have our reservation and were annoyed at our presence.  Our waitress Nicole, seemed also to be annoyed and complained that she was so busy.  Really?  It's Saturday night.  The food was mediocre at best and the beer was warm.  There are plenty of other establishments in the Pittsburgh area that will appreciate 6 people eating and drinking in their restaurant.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Glad they are still around a few years after my first visit. The decor is great. The bar looks to be mail with rails from tracks and, of course, the chandelier is beautiful.

The food is normally very good. I love their proper Rueben. The butternut squash ravioli is delightful. The pork schnitzel is delicious. The prices are very fair for the sandwiches. Some of the entrees and beer are a bit pricey.

My only suggestion for improvement would be the service is sometimes in need of improvement. Regardless, great addition to Homestead and I wish them continued success!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection - best meatloaf I ever had. Perogies and brussels sprouts are an absolute must! :-) I can't get over the atmosphere, love the music and the chandeliers and ambient lighting. I found my new favorite hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Delish!  I had the crab cake appetizer (nice portion and delicious) and the appetizer jalapeño pierogis.  The entertainment schedule looked interesting too.  Can't wait to stop back!"}
{"text":"Was there on a Wednesday around 12:30. I was 3 other people and there was another couple in the bar. Our food took so long. We were shocked since there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I asked for a cherry coke and 20
minutes went by and I had to go up to my server at the bar and remind her. I ordered the pirogies appetizer and asked for all cheese. The appetizer came with 3 pirogies and I ate the first two and then the last one was beer and bacon. I did enjoy the French onion soup though. It's a cute little place with some cool decor."}
{"text":"Just started going here (2 visits), and it's my new favorite place. Cool steel heritage environment, great craft beer selection (go just to check out the tap handles), and the stuffed meatball appetizer is awesome. If you're going to the waterfront, you need to check this place out on 8th avenue near the gas station, which is right by the waterfront (less than a mile) and spare yourself the boring chains you usually eat at when you go to the waterfront."}
{"text":"Just read about this place a week ago and thought it would be a good addition for dinner and drinks.
Stopped in on a Saturday evening. Bar was quite full but we got seated upstairs. The atmosphere is nice. Good textures wood floors, brick walls, tin ceiling.
Beer selection looked good with a lot of draft beers on tap.
Our waitress got us water and took our drink order shortly after seating.
She took our food order and another round of drinks. The four of us all got sandwiches. About an hour and twenty minutes later we were served our food. That seems to be the issue this place has. They can't get the food out. The sandwiches were good. No problem there. But if you have anything else to do that evening this probably isn't the spot to eat.
The manager who I believe also to be the owner did stop by the table. 
Seemed to have an attitude. Offered no apology or reason and walked away from us. Not good! Our waitress took $5.00 off each of two checks which was nice. Management has to have a better feel for service though and most of all get the kitchen to turn out tickets faster.
I wish them good luck here. Not a bad place. Just needs a little more."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Went with two of my sisters and the following are the items that we all tried:
-cheese pierogis, sautéed: so much filling, these were delicious!!!
-Brussels: 
-cauliflower soup, yum! 
-cheeseburger and fries, also  
 
The only item we tried that left some room for improvement was stuffed meatballs (slightly tough in texture, cheese flavor was lacking a bit, sauce was watery and flavorless. 

The server was friendly and decor was nice! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Went to a movie and was looking for somewhere to eat! What a fine! Great food great service and the restaurant had great ambience . We loved it!!! Will definitely be back. Be smart and forget the chains."}
{"text":"Hey! 
Weirdest thing....
I yelped for ideas and came up with this place! 
We loved the menu items. Looked delicious
 Homeade flavor! 
My doggone step brother works here! 
We never truely met so it was like meeting for real haha 
Weird. 
Good food tho!"}
{"text":"I visited last Sun. for dinner after seeing a movie at AMC Loews theater in the Waterfront.  Because I visit the Waterfront now and again to see movies, I keep a list of non-chain restaurants nearby handy, and Dorothy 6 was at the top of it.

I don't know if the bells on the door failed to jingle when I walked in, but oddly, nobody came to greet me and my dining partner. Because it was empty except for maybe one other customer at the bar, we took the liberty of choosing a table.  Before we sat down, a waitress emerged from the kitchen and handed us menus.  Because their website doesn't seem to be functioning, I wasn't able to look up the menu ahead of time, which would have been nice.  As it were, I found the prices a bit higher than I would have liked.  The waitress mentioned the special of the day, crab-stuffed salmon, which sounded amazing, but I balked at the price ($20). Instead, I went with the pierogi entree ($16), and my dining partner went with the reuben sandwich ($10).

When the food came out, after about 10 min., it looked good, but I was a bit surprised by the presentation of the side dish, which was described as caramelized brussels sprouts with bacon.  I was expecting whole brussels sprouts, but this was more of a salad (see photo).  Nevertheless, I found the taste quite pleasant.  As for the pierogis, it was obvious that they were made fresh on site.  The exterior had a satisfying crispness, and the filling had just the right amount of cheddar flavor, and was soft but not mealy.  The caramelized onions served on top of the pierogis added a hint of sweetness, and the sour cream had a pleasant tinge of seasoning.  I was only able to eat half of the pierogis and brussels sprouts, so I took the rest home, and they were just as good the next day.  I didn't taste my dining partner's reuben, so I can't comment on it myself, but he enjoyed it, finishing it and the steak-cut fries that came with it.

In general, I found the quality of food here to be quite good, but I found it to be a bit overpriced.  I don't have any complaints about the service, and the ambiance, as others have mentioned, is quite interesting and beautiful.  I'm not sure if business is normally as slow as it was when I visited.  I hope not, since I'd like to see this place succeed, esp. in a town such as Homestead, which has few shopping and dining options outside of the Waterfront."}
{"text":"Food excellent, atmosphere is really neat, but 2/3 times I've been there service was extremely slow. An hour or more to get food."}
{"text":"There is a nice feel to the place, with a decadent Chandelier hanging as soon as you walk in. Staff is friendly and helpful. It is small but comfortable. The food was good. I had the meatloaf with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. Though  the brussel sprouts are not your conventional type but were good. It would have been a wonderful experience if it weren't for the bill. The prices in my opinion are much higher than they should be, perhaps if the portions were larger it may justified. It seems they are not sure what they want to be, a high end restaurant or local hip bar."}
{"text":"We heard so much about the delicious food at Dorothy 6 that we couldn't wait to go.  Our group had reservations and were seating promptly after sitting at the bar for a few moments. The atmosphere is excellent.  Beers on tap were delicious and price as expected.  I had the cherry cider beer...Yummy.
The menu is a bit limited but expected with a small restaurant.  The Reuben Balls were a very good appetizer.  Our table also ordered the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was a bit overly dressed and became soggy.  For our entrees, I had the chicken club which was delicious.  My husband and another ordered the french dip sandwich which had good flavor but the bun was inappropriate and not crusty to hold up with the au jus.  We enjoyed the evening and had good service with a smiling waitress."}
{"text":"This is a yem right there in the middle of Homestead where you will never imagine.
Just a little distance from the waterfront restaurants, this one is worth the short drive after movie or shopping at the waterfront costco etc! The food is all excellent. I have been there 4 times and every single thing order has been delicious. I keep going because food is great, prices are fair and service is good! They have a many beers other places don't have. PLUS this is a local business owned by someone from the area. Congratulations to the owner and I am sure they will keep the success.!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place! It's close to the house and trendy industrial interior. But service has lacked each time. Today was sitting at a high top table with no service from anyone, even the hostess (who I think is the owner) walked past multiple times and did not acknowledge us. 

Then we snagged two seats at the bar close to the service bar area. The clean cut blond male bartender who was working service bar did not have the curtesy to clear the glasses or check from the previous patron. He looked us right in the eye and continue to pour beer and make drinks w/o acknowledgment. I swear he was a mute. Then the other bartender who's 2nd day was a Saturday night tried to save the night. (Was clearly in the weeds) 

However when my fiancé ordered a $7 Moscow mule and it was poured with jacquins vodka, come on at least Smirnoff or skyy. The night was over. I chugged my Kentucky bourbon barrel ale and off we were. 
Also as we were leaving, we saw the feature for the night. Beer & bacon pierogies for $16. Who the hell is gonna pay $16 for pierogies? They may be the best pierogies in the world, but it's just dough. All the pieces are there to be a great place, please I beg you D6 do things right & have a better menu selection than only things that are apps served as dinner entrees. 

Thank you! & please consider

PS the 2nd star is only because off decor and beer selection."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service
Hidden in Homestead
Great beers great atmosphere 
Try the crab cakes!
Don't lose the chef!!!"}
{"text":"Cute environment. Service was excellent! We all got either the Reuben or pulled pork. The French fries were big steak fries and really crispy. The jalepeno pierogies were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! First of all, excellent craft beers on draft. Second, the food is soooo good (try the flank steak!). Third, cool looking space. Fourth, awesome service! We had a great time!"}
{"text":"I pass by here daily and one day I saw they had their open sign on. On a whim I went there with my wife to check out the new place. The decor was a very cool mix of vintage chandelier with modern furniture. The bar looked amazing especially the 22 taps with custom steel sign. There is also an upstairs balcony and outdoor enclosed courtyard with gas heaters. We are vegetarians and we had the jalapeno pierogies and the artichoke bruschetta. Both were amazing, especially the bruschetta was the best I had ever had! The service was excellent, and quick. One of the owners even came by and chatted with us for awhile answering questions about the restaurant. They have several large TV's which would be nice for watching the game - but not with a sports bar feel. Overall I love the addition of Dorothy 6 to Homestead and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a good review of this restaurant as it is a cute place but the service was not good and the food was only fair. This is the 2nd time we have been to the restaurant before a show at the music library theater. Each time we had a reservation at least 2 1/2 hours before the show. It took an hour and a half for our food to arrive. The first time we had to take our food in boxes as we would miss the show. This time after finishing our food we were relaxing, talking & having good conversation when our server asked us to leave as they needed the table. We were astonished as there were tables available & very few people waiting for a table. We were very disappointed to say the least. Unfortunately, we will not return & will look for another dining establishment near the theater."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find in Homestead where the only options are chains or Yinzer bars. The atmosphere is great: very clean, good seating, nice lighting, unique decor. A great outdoor patio with cute lights and umbrella tables. Nice bar. More of a restaurant than a bar..which I prefer.

Food is fantastic. A small all from scratch items. Strip steak, big juicy crab cakes, amazing homemade perogies, and the Brussel sprouts are to die for. Huge craft beer selection. 

The owner is nice..always checks on everything which is probably why it's good. What a great little joint!!"}
{"text":"After having a couple brews at nearby Voodoo Brewery I stopped at Dorothy 6 for a light dinner.  I sat at the bar and truly enjoyed the decor - this is a pretty cool place.  Great craft brews on draft and a friendly bartender serving them.
I ordered the pierogies and they were really tasty.  However, the pricing seems off here.  I can't remember the exact prices, but it was cheaper to order more pierogies from the appetizer menu than it was to order it as an entree.  
I hope to come back and enjoy something else from the menu and some fine beers."}
{"text":"Went to Dorothy Blast for brunch a few weeks ago. I ordered the crab benedict and it was really good. I would have liked more hollandaise on the dish but I feel like I would say that at any restaurant at any time about any sauce. They also have a jazz player during brunch, which was really enjoyable and different from my usual brunch spots. My bf ordered steak and eggs minus the eggs (the psychopath hates eggs, like a psychopath). The steak was cooked well and it came with tasty potatoes. All around delicious!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here for my birthday last weekend to try something new. There is street parking and we easily found a spot and headed over to meet the rest of our group.

We were seated upstairs at a large table off to the side...I believe they said it seats 12. The restaurant has a huge chandelier and tons of artwork giving it a very cool vibe.

The service was not very good but the food was...that is why I gave it 4 stars. The server seemed overwhelmed and the whole experience took 2.5hrs which was fine cause we weren't in a hurry but still waited a long time for food. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the banana peppers...they were out so we switched to the crab dip but were brought the bruschetta....when she asked if that was correct and we said no she did not offer to correct it. That being said....it was amazing and we were happy with this minor error. We then ordered the burger and butternut squash ravioli....when our food came out I was given an asparagus and mushroom ravioli...not a huge deal but she sat it down and never gave the opportunity to ask what happened with the original order. Because we had waited so long I dug in and was again pleasantly surprised with a dish I was not expecting.

They allowed us to bring in an outside cake and even helped to take some pictures. All in all it was a great place...next time I am just looking forward to trying some of the food I order haha."}
{"text":"Can't believe we waited 3 years to try this place. Great beer selection (20 crafts on tap.  Would have preferred more local ones). Bottles for less adventurous (wife). Food was great. pierogies, smoked cheese crab dip, stuffed meatballs...All were well worth coming back for. Great atmosphere. Outdoor patio dining. Really fare prices."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food is great once you get it. We waited 15 minutes for our drinks only to be told that I needed to choose another cocktail because the bar didn't have an ingredient. That was fine but we waited 45 mins for our food as we watched three tables who came in well after us get their entrees. We specifically put our order in quickly with our drink order as we were short on time before a concert at the Carnegie. Our waitress wasn't around to ask for anything so we had to flag down the young girl who appeared to be serving the entire second floor by herself.  This could be a great place if the waitresses did a better job."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat.  Forget the long waits at the chain restaurants in the waterfront.  Visit Dorothy's and get great homemade and fresh food!  Best crab cakes EVER!"}
{"text":"We reserved the Karma Lounge for a Sunday evening for 25-30 people. Talked with the general manager Pat and he said it was not a problem. Sent over some info and said to call back when we decided what to do for food. I called back a week before the event and confirmed everything. Asked specifically if he needed anything else from me, even another call closer to the event and he said we are good. See them in a week. When we showed up the day of the event, there was one server and one bartender and she said nothing was written down about the event. She got very upset but she said she would do everything possible to help us. Her name was Nichole and she was awesome. She was able to call in another server and she seemed relieved we weren't upset with her. Even though it took a while to get situated, the two servers were great and the food was all correct.

The reason I give the low review though is, first, the general manager missed scheduling help for this event and never wrote it down. Two, the \"manager\" on duty was the bartender. He made no attempt to help, was irritated at everything and just looked like he didn't want to be there. We had no ridiculous requests, just wanted some drinks and offered to help carry them up. But he insisted on make the waitress do it herself and make us wait longer. Other guests at the event made remarks on how rude he was. I wish I could have given the mandatory tip they charged to the waiting staff and chef as they did all the work. It's sad that management is so terrible there when they have a good place and great staff. I don't know that we will go back."}
{"text":"First off - staff is amazing.  Nicole was a wonderful waitress.  Had the crab dip appetizer. D6 Burger and Butternut Squash Ravioli for dinner.  Both were great.  Ordered the Apple cake for dessert.  More of a pie in my opinion but still great. It was early when we got there - about 5pm - so it wasn't too busy but the place was hustling when we left (approx 7). Met one of the owners.  Very nice. 

Went back again. Another good meal.  Arsenal cider from the bar - great and strong.  Tried the pierogies - they were good.  Stuffed banana peppers were awesome - but spicy in case that isn't your thing.  I had the pork schnitzel with mash and apple sauce.  The sauce for the pork was soooo good.  As for Bernadette's cake - well, I got it to go but I wish I would have left it.  Nothing to write home about.  My sister in laws cheesecake was pretty disappointing too.  Maybe it would have been different if we hadn't gotten them to go.  All in all - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My salmon sandwich was decent, nothing special. Our food came out way before our appetizer which was odd. The waitress apologized and asked if we still wanted it. Uhh yes, I still want it haha. For the appetizer we got the spinach artichoke brucshetta and it was very good. Didn't try any drinks. The decor and ambiance were nice."}
{"text":"Very friendly service (they brought us the wrong soup and then let us keep it complimentary), great beer selection, delicious food. Don't go to crowded mediocre Waterfront restaurants when this hidden gem is right in Homestead."}
{"text":"I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  

As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.

When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!

How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!  

I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Best restaurant I have dined in in Pittsburgh area in last 43 years. If I didn't live 335 miles away I would be there weekly. Pierogies are to die for. Really liked jalapeño. Eggs Benedict with applewood bacon on latkes was heavenly"}
{"text":"After seeing that they were having a dog day on the patio we decided to try Dorothy 6 for brunch. It was a gorgeous day and we were happy that we didn't have to wait for a table but we were not able to get a table with an umbrella since there are only a few of those. I had the choco zuke french toast sticks as did my friend. We both loved them. So chocolatey and decadent, it was basically eating a dessert for breakfast...which is fine with me! Husband had the potato pancake benedict and he gave it 5 stars. The potato panckes in this dish were perfect. We can't wait to go back and try more brunch dishes because the entire brunch menu looks delicious.
Dorothy's patio is dog friendly and they have special dog dishes made with natural ingredients available every day. We ordered the small \"burger\" patty for the dog. It was full of veggies and fresh ingredients and our dog ate it in the blink of an eye!
Service was fantastic and friendly. Our drinks and a dog bowl of water were brought promptly and frequently refilled.

We had an excellent meal and service and can't wait to enjoy a great restaurant again.  We know the dog will want to go and get a special treat again too!"}
{"text":"I have been remiss in reviewing Dorothy 6, shame on me! I love the idea of it, the concept is good but not fully executed, which is unfortunate because this place has what it takes to be really special. They have a nice selection of beers and do flights for your tasting pleasure, and my sandwich was quite satisfying, with a good price point for the quality of food, service, and the area. Our party had a young child and the staff was totally cool. Overall good time, it just left me feeling it was missing that last key to the 5 star puzzle.  I'd give them 4 and a half, but there are no halves."}
{"text":"Service. It's all about the service, folks...or the lack thereof. I've been anxious to try this relatively new establishment. After all, when I was a kid this area of town was hopping with steel mills, thriving shops, and even a once regal theater. I am always thrilled to see someone trying to do something positive here. But it takes more than the hook of memories. 

Nostalgia lines the walls, the rafters, and even the bar. Artifacts of glorious steel days gone by are the backbone of Dorothy's decor. The spot is both warm and gritty, a nice vibe.

We sat at the bar to enjoy a quick cocktail and a salad before heading to Homestead's Carnegie Music Hall for an evening of acoustic Frampton. When we got there, there were plenty of seats both at the bar and surrounding tables. It took a while for our bartender, Lisa, to take our drink orders. She told us she was new and was just learning the ropes there, but the bar manager was overseeing the making of our drinks. Fine by us! 

And that's where it all went downhill. We couldn't get her attention to place our orders for dinner...repeatedly. Once the orders were taken - a beet/arugula salad with hangar steak and a wedge salad with chicken - we waited again. And waited. Again. 

After waiting approximately half an hour, I asked Lisa when our salads would be ready. Two women to our right gave each other looks and said to us that the kitchen is notoriously slow. I was getting nervous about making the show at this point. But we waited. Again. Another 10-15 minutes later and our salads still hadn't arrived. I asked Lisa to cancel our orders, we had to make the curtain. The tirade I endured from Lisa was inexcusable. She stood there and argued that it couldn't be cancelled, we hadn't been waiting all that long, stomped to the kitchen and came out with our salads. Freaking salads, not a Michelin starred dinner.

I should have just paid for the drinks, but foolishly didn't want to endure any further abuse from Lisa, so just had her box up the salads and left. I have no idea how to rate the food, it's still in my fridge. We barely made it to the concert on time. 

Bottom line, don't waste your time or money until the kitchen learns to make a salad in less than 45 minutes and the staff learns how to treat a customer."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Homestead for a second before I get into the review. I love it. Lots of history, and it's an area which is clearly going to be changing in the next few years. It's taken longer than most, but with places like Dorothy 6, Honest John's and the new brewery which is in the works, things appear to be looking up. This is a good thing.

Dorothy 6, where to begin? We called ahead and asked if they were busy and could take guests, we were told to come on in. We parked and we were greeted promptly. We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside on their patio. We chose inside as it looked as if rain was coming. Next time we go we will definitely be sitting on the patio as it's awesome. There's a brick wall covered in ivy, what more can one ask for?

Dorothy 6 has twenty beers on draft and they clearly rotate. I wasn't a fan of a majority of what they had, but I did find a winner. My girl had a Moscow mule and it was really damn good as well.

We decided to try the bruschetta appetizer, which is a bit different than your standard bruschetta, but it was good. Maybe a little salty due to the goat cheese but not bad. The whole grain bread that it was on was awesome however.

We were told the specials by our server who happened to be the bartender as well. I ordered the special which was cabbage rolls. I love a good cabbage roll. She ordered the perogies, 2 jalapeño, three cheddar. With hers came crispy Brussels sprouts with bacon. She loved the Brussels sprouts and so did I. They were top notch. She also tried a side of their house made corned beef. She didn't care for it because she could taste the pickling liquid. I personally loved the corned beef.

Back to the cabbage rolls...they never made it to the table. They had actually oversold them and I missed the boat. I was asked what I would like in place of it and they offered to buy. I chose the meatloaf. It arrived in less than a minute. They had an order come up and sent it out immediately. I'm glad I did. It was probably the best I'd ever ate. The gravy was excellent. It wasn't over cooked and dry. The bacon which wrapped it was a bit flimsy but that's not a big deal. The mashers were good which accompanied it. The veggies were fresh green beans with fresh halved tomatoes. It hit the spot.

Very seldom does a restaurant recover from a blunder like that, and they did it effortlessly.

Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I came with my boyfriend for a drink on Friday night, because we were in the area.  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  It was a cool industrial style bar with an awesome history.  I liked learning a bit about the Pittsburgh steel business just by reading the menu!  There were lots of beers to choose from and they had beer flights available too (4 for $10).  We tried some beer which was great and a side of Brussels sprouts.  I have had better Brussels sprouts, these were a bit too chopped up for me, but they were ok.  As for the drinks and atmosphere I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant. The first time we came it was during the week. There was one other couple having dinner and 3 people at the bar. It was a good experience. Tonight. . . Not so much. We didn't realize you had to have reservations. Most restaurants don't take them anymore unless it's a very upscale or higher end. We were told with no reservation it would be a 20 minute wait. It was more than half an hour. We were seated and because we had perished the menu we were ready to order. Our waitress took our order, brought us bread, brought us food and we didn't see her again until she spotted us sitting with a table full of empty dishes. Instead of entrees we ordered a few appetizers. I had the meatballs and the wedge salad. I didn't care for the strips of fried red pepper and I had 2 specs of bacon. He cucumber slices were small but nice. The tomatoes brought color to the plate. My other appetizer was meatballs. It was four meatballs and a small cup of marinara. The meatballs were a little over done. The marinara was ok-nothing to write home about. 
I'm not taking Dorothy's off of my list of places to go but will definitely make sure it's a weeknight."}
{"text":"Exposed brick, tin ceilings, and crystal chandeliers are just some of the swank you'll encounter at this place. Despite the fancy pants decor, the vibe was laid-back and casual, so I wasn't the least bit self-conscious in my columbia fleece and yoga pants. Note: Stretchy pants are essential if you plan to stuff yourself with pierogi.

We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday and there were only two other parties in the downstairs area, so we got seated right away. 

We ordered a sample of the pierogi for our appetizer ($6): One cheddar, one jalepeno, and one bacon. These pierogi are legit. All were delicious in their own way, but the jalepeno really stole the show. 

The Reuben I ordered was a solidly good sandwich ($10) and my husband's flat iron steak was melt in your mouth tender ($17). I also really enjoyed my husband's brussel sprout side dish ... to the point where he had to defend his plate with his utensils. 

I don't know why anyone would opt for a Waterfront chain restaurant when there is a place like this just over the railroad tracks. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars because I just cant bring myself to give any local non-chain establishment a 1 star. Can't stress the importance enough about good customer service. Two bartenders, small bar area. No greeting when we sat at bar, not even a smile although we made eye contact with both bartenders, not even an I'll be with you shortly. Waited 15 minutes, then I actually had to lean over the dirty dishes that were still there from the previous bar guests, and ask for a drink. Got the drinks, no suggestion for us to even see a menu. I thought this place might give Honest Johns and 8th & Hays a run for their $$, but there's no way this place can touch the experience the other two local establishments provide. Would have loved to rate the food but did I mention we were never offered menus, oh I guess I did."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Good food, great beers and a very relaxed atmosphere. I tried a few of the appetizers, the home made peirogies and the crab cake. Both were home made and fresh. 

I had the Porter they had on tap. It was a local brew, I forget from where. They also had some live acoustic music, but apparently it is not very regular. 

The entire homestead area is definitely going through a revival, and this is one of several establishments that are worth the trip there."}
{"text":"They have a great selection craft beers on tap. The food was very good and served hot, which I have a issue with when it isn't. The waitress was friendly and attentive. There is only street parking which was the only drawback. Everything else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Having a great time here enjoying some craft beers. We planned to eat dinner here but got filled up on the Sam's Club samples so got appetizers instead.  The décor is nice with awesome wood floors and brick walls.  There is an upstairs and outdoor seating but we didn't venture to those places.

The service is good and you can sample the different beers before deciding which one you want. 

There is music coming from somewhere and there are three or more TVs on the wall showing sports.

Many people here having a good time - it's a fun atmosphere where you can do what you like since no one thing is overpowering.

Quick edit since I just found the paper towel dispenser in the restroom.  So funny, made my night!!"}
{"text":"A dining highlight in homestead - we had the app pierogies. Pierogies are a great Hungarian treat.  These had s twist and I loved the bacon and cheddar, jalapeño , and sweet potato.  I grew up eating the basic ones and these were homemade deliciousness!!  The meatball sub was delicious. I absolutely loved the honey blackened salmon. Handsdown a highlight were the shaved brussel sprouts = light and flavorful!  Btw- this place gets 5- bc the service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Back at the Dorothy 6 again...  Beautiful decor and comfortable ambience brought me back. I sat at the bar and was greeted cheerfully by the bartender. I got a beer (impressive beer selection), and reviewed the menu. 

Every entree I've had here has been excellent. My first time in I got the meatloaf and it was delicious... Bacon on top and smothered in gravy. You could tell the mashed potatoes were real (not out of a box) and even the green beans were special. Since then I've had the flat iron steak and the salmon croquettes. Never a disappointment. 

Tonight I decided to try a few appetizers for something different: reuban bites and pierogies.

It didn't take long for my order to arrive. To be honest,  the reuban bites were a bit dry for my liking but they weren't horrible and I still ate them (who knows,  you might enjoy them that way). The pierogies, two cheddar and two jalipino, may have been the best pierogies I've ever had.  

I just really like this place.  The service is good, the atmosphere is comfortable and the bartender is hard not to like.  I still enjoy the Blue Dust, but this place is going to give them a run for their money and the competition between the two can only benefit the foodie and \"beer snob\" consumers in this area. 

If you find yourself in the Homestead area I would highly recommend that you stop into Dorothy 6."}
{"text":"The perogies are great especially the jalapeño ones. The stuffed mushroom cap with quinoa were delicious. Great cocktails.  The server Cathy was patient and professional .  The owner stopped by our table, very personable. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to beg for water refills which came in a carafe without ice. No ice refills. Food might have been good if served when it was freshly cooked. Plates were super hot but food wasn't leading me to believe that they had sat under a heat tray for awhile. End result was dried out, bland food. Prices were high for what we got. We will not be back."}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the boring chains along the waterfront and enjoy a delicious, casual meal, then this place should be at the top of your list. Traveling on business, I found this gem thanks to other Yelp users and decided to give it a try. The service was phenomenal, and the food was a bargain.

I had the special, a generous filet with polenta and the bacon Brussel sprouts. The plate I got was simply presented without fanfare. The filet was perfect, the polenta was great, but the best flavor was the sprouts. I will most definitely return to this locally owned spot in a town that needs more places like this."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and drinks!  Love this place!  Rachael is outstanding!!!!  We had appetizers, dinner, drinks, and dessert.  Spent about two and a half hours enjoying the food and environment.  The owner and staff were accommodating to our needs!  Absolutely spoiled and catered to!  Will repeatedly come back!!!"}
{"text":"Get away from the chain restaurants at the waterfront, come across the tracks, and go to this stylish, trendy place.  Excellent craft beer selection, cool outdoor patio area. Jalapeno perogies were a fun twist on the old school traditional. Thick steak fries were yum, and french dip meat was tender. Carmelized onions were so sweet. Beet salad was delish. Love seeing the revitalization of 8th Ave.!"}
{"text":"Getting a late start to vacation cause of work but hey got to start somewhere and had to be close. First time here at Dorthy 6. Happy Hour 4-6. I have the cherry mule, wife has the Riesling. Our waitress Nicole, is great with the menu & suggestions. For an appetizer, we're having mozzarella stuffed meatballs. My dinner will be the meatloaf. Wife's dinner will be crab cake appetizer along with the beet & arugula salad. Hopefully later I can share our thoughts on the tastes.
Yes all food was great!  Can't wait to go back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"What a gem in the older part of town.  Beautiful place.  Microbrewery beer over 15 different types.  Food was amazing.  Staff friendly and professional.  I am passing through town and very glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"I have to say that when venturing into the wasteland that is Homestead, one never really knows what one may find. It is great that someone is making an attempt to revive some of the multitude of vacant buildings which are rotting away two blocks from yet another mill-turned-mall. This neighborhood once had a short list of 'must visits'...and then came...the mall. And away went...the must visits. From my point of view, except for the usual strip mall shopping, there are only two 'draws' to the entire neighborhood. The movie theater, and the Carnegie Music Hall. And I really feel that Dorothy 6 will excel...when there's a show at the music hall. OR, in exceedingly rare cases, an intellectual winner at the megaplex movie theater that doesn't appeal to the mindless chain chow masses who only go to watch things blow up..

Dorothy 6 is a little architectural surprise in a mostly plywood-windowed run down area that USED to be a livable working class neighborhood. Exposed brick, chandeliers...a comfortable and only slightly pretentious bistroid setting. Definitely a bit out of place for the location, but a good start.

A friend and I were on a night-out reprieve from a snowed-in week, and decided to try something 'different' that had been raved about by Yelpers.

The food? We had a stuffed meatball appetizer, which were four little meatballs stuffed with cheese and served with a dipping sauce of some sort. The meatballs were very good, and the dipping sauce was not any kind of distraction from the flavor of the meat.

Earlier in the day, I'd had a late breakfast with another friend who took me to a place with a Reuben that was reported to be very good, but turned out to be just ok (as usual). And here at D6, there it was on the menu...a Reuben. Well, ok. Try TWO new ones in one day. So I ordered the Reuben with fries, and my friend ordered the Pierogi sampler.

The waiter was very pleasant and attentive in his hipster bearded and over-tatted way, and actually was very nice and efficient. He kept the Diet Coke flowing, which is an awesome thing.

So the food arrived, and the report is in. The pierogi were nicely and obviously home made, with quality ingredient stuffing. She had three flavors to sample. Cheese. beer and bacon, and Jalapeno. I tried a bit of one of the jalapeno, and it was very good. But I believe she had five pierogi for $13? We're not talking cover-the-plate pierogi. We're talking a little smaller than Mrs. T's, but made from scratch. Dough, potato, and just enough of the extra 'ingredient' (jalapeno, bacon, etc.) for a zing. $13 for five? A bit steep. They were very tasty. But not worth an hour of your average Pittsburgh working wage.

The Reuben was a little less in price, even with the fries, but again, failed the NY Reuben test. This and the lunch Reuben were very similar, except this one DID use dark rye, but very light on the meat, which is the reason for a Reuben. The fries were actually not very good at all, and really seemed like frozen pseudo steak fries from the Sysco truck. I didn't eat those.

The place has good service, and a comfortable atmosphere...but as I've said many times before, I go out to eat for...food. I don't eat atmosphere. And no matter how nice the server might be (even IF he slips me his phone number and says 'call me, daddy'), if the food isn't a huge wow, I probably won't be back to 'eat'. That being said, should the Carnegie Music Hall pull in another artist worth venturing into that neighborhood to see, Dorothy 6 certainly is one of the best choices outside of 'the mall', and a much better choice than anything chainey IN the mall.

It was a good place to hang out and talk. A better balance between food and price, and it would be a bigger winner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives in Munhall and when she asked where I wanted to go one weekend evening I told her Dorothy 6 just had to be on the list. I had heard about it just a week earlier and was dying for some new scenery.  I was also excited to check out a place with some history. I read that much of the bar was created from pieces of metal from Pittsburgh's past. 

I absolutely love exposed brick and this place brings it on in the best way possible. Brick, steel, concrete, chandeliers, and pretty string lights. At first glance it looks pretty upscale but after a few minutes you start to realize it's not uptight and in fact is actually very chill. It's a nice change of pace from the nearby chains in the Waterfront or the college-kid filled bars of the South Side. 

We had a few other stops planned so we decided to keep it \"light\" and split two apps. We shared the pierogies ($6) (both the cheddar and jalapeño) and the crab cakes ($10). The pierogies were absolutely delish! The crab cakes were good too, good consistency and crab content. 

They had a pretty expansive draft list, the bartender was very attentive although there were only 2 other tables in there at the time. The courtyard was absolutely adorable. I love string lights, made it feel whimsical and special. 

I think this would make a good date night place as well! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food was good.

The food was good, but could have been warmer upon arrival. The service was okay. 

I'll definitely be back to try some other things off of the menu!"}
{"text":"After visiting Dorothy 6 cafe twice in the last 5 months, I am thoroughly confused as to how most of these reviews are even talking about the same restaurant. As a Munhall resident, I was really excited when Dorothy 6 opened to have somewhere \"different\" to try, instead of the same old waterfront restaurants. The first time I dined there was in December 2014, not long after they opened. We had a group of 7, and we were very impressed by the decor. Cozy and unique, beautiful bar area, large beer selection, etc. The staff seemed friendly as well! Our service was extremely slow, which i attributed to the fact that they had opened very recently, and maybe weren't used to having many \"large\" parties yet, and also because we were seated upstairs (the staff had to walk up alot of steps to reach us). My sister and I both ordered the french onion soup, which was cold when it was served to us (not hot.. not even warm.. ICE COLD). We also both ordered the french dip sandwich.. Mine was OK at best, but very very bland. My sister's meat on her sandwich was so undercooked she couldn't finish half of it. A couple people got the pirogies, which they said were good. But overall, we left disappointed. We decided to give the restaurant another chance last night, and brought a party of 15-20 to celebrate my fiancés birthday. We were again seated upstairs, which was completely empty. I was impressed how cooperative the staff was, since we had such a large party with no reservation! However, the food service was again TERRIBLY slow. I have worked in the food industry in the past, and I fully understand how difficult it can be to wait on such a large group.. but there was literally only ONE waitress attempting to take care of us. I don't understand why they wouldn't send her up any help, especially since we were spending a significant amount of money that night. I ordered the soup, pirogies appetizer, and a fish sandwich. My soup and pirogies took (no exaggeration) AN HOUR AND A HALF to come out. Some people in our party even had their entrées before i had my soup (which again, was ice cold). The pirogies WERE good (but very greasy and cold).. but my fish sandwich (which was served 2 hours after I ordered it) was DRY and COLD, along with my fries. When the waitess brought the checks, EVERY SINGLE PERSONS was INCREDIBLY wrong. It was overall (again) a really bad experience. I really wanted to like this place, but after giving them a second chance, I definitely won't be returning to Dorothy 6 cafe (and neither will the many people who were there last night)."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area and gave Dorothy a try and we all really enjoyed it. The Pierogies were really really good. The Chili with the cornbread on top was also fantastic.  The place was really nice inside, very comfortable, and the staff was very friendly. We would definitely highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My wife has mentioned a few times that she wanted to go here for brunch and we finally got to come here.  There is street parking here but it can be a little difficult to find parking during prime time hours here.  We made reservations ahead of time.  We didn't actually use them because we just walked into the bar area and found a small table across from the bar.  I still recommended reservations for brunch here.

     We got here at 1pm and we hadn't eaten yet for the day so we were quite hungry.  The bartender was a little busy but she greeted us right away and she said she would get to us in just a second.  She gave us their brunch menu that we had already checked out a head of time but we looked over it again.  They have a nice brunch menu.  There were 3 or 4 things that I wanted to try.  I was hungry so I wanted to try something that would keep me full throughout the day.  I wanted some pancakes too but I didn't want to be too full for our Sunday Funday!

     We ordered our drinks first.  My wife got an Irish coffee and I got a tequila sunrise.  I usually don't get drinks like that but I just felt like I wanted that type of drink.  It was a good drink.  Not strong but it tasted good.  I actually didn't have another drink after this one.  
Carrie ordered their eggs benedict with crab and I got the Potato Pancake benedict with bacon on it.  We waited a long time for our food.  That is probably my only complaint here but getting food that is really good but takes awhile to make isn't a bad thing and I think that's what happened here.

     So our food came out and they both looked great!  Carrie's eggs benedict was good but her poached eggs were dry unfortunately.  My poached eggs were perfect so I let her use some of my yoke.  The crab that she added to her order looked so good and she said it was a great combination.  My potato pancake benedict was so good.  The bacon was crispy and worked great with my runny poached eggs.  It just wasn't enough for me.  I needed another potato pancake or something to go with this meal.  (You were right Carrie I should have ordered those Pancakes too!) I'm sure we will be back again and I will order more next time. 

     The atmosphere here was nice too.  The bar is open and the floors look great and they have a really nice chandelier to look at.  Overall it was a great brunch date with my wife and we are looking forward to coming her again for brunch or dinner.  Thanks Dorothy!"}
{"text":"Food was good. The decoration and vibe was really cool also!! Unfortunately food and drinks came out wrong and it took forever to get anything. The waitress seemed really overwhelmed and the hostess was beyond rude when our group asked for a picture. Would love to try this place again, they have a really cool looking outdoor space, and they are right near voodoo brewery so it's a nice spot for a night out."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we had in a long time. The drinks were fantastic the dinners were amazing and the staff was super friendly!! This place was recommended to us by family and we were not disappointed at all!! Howard our serve was friendly funny and informative. So glad we good the chance and tried a new place! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I guess we got lucky because we thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. We got there kind of early on a Saturday night (around 5:30-6), so that might be the window for good service as it was busy but not yet packed.  Our server was great (I forgot to catch her name) - attentive but not overly so.  We sat in the outdoor area and it was cool and breezy (the patio lies between 2 buildings which block the sun so it's not roasting out there) and quiet- they were playing some blues/jazz music which was a good volume so that it wasn't overpowering but you still didn't have to hear other people's conversations. Though the metal chairs out there aren't super comfortable, that would be my only complaint.  

We had the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was to die for.  It was a really hearty size, but we could have eaten several more plates of it it was so good.  I had the flat iron steak. I asked for it medium and it came out medium and was perfect.  Hubby had the perogies with jalapeño and was happy.  I had a nice glass of house pinot noir, hubby had a beer on tap.  I feel the prices were reasonable - an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $50 which is not bad for date night.  I would definitely go again next time we're in Homestead."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate dinner at Dorothy 6 last night prior to a show. Initially, we were all very impressed by the downstairs atmosphere, great beer selection and decor. We got there around 6pm and had to be at the show down the road at 8pm. There were six of us so we were sat upstairs, which was a bit awkward as we were the only people up there for the first 20 minutes or so. Nevertheless, we were attended to quickly at first and we were not in a hurry given that we had an hour and a half or more for dinner. After our first round of drinks, we ordered food by 6:30pm and that's where it started going wrong. The waitress didn't come back for almost an hour. She left one of the drinks we ordered with the meal on the bar and when she brought it up 45 minutes later, all the ice had melted but she served it anyway and gave no apology for why it took so long. In the meantime, our friends had to go downstairs to order more drinks at the bar. Two other groups were sat upstairs after us and both were served much sooner than us. Our food finally arrived at 7:40pm, again with no apology or even excuse, and we had to scarf it down and then run to the show. I will say that the food was good, though none of us got to enjoy it. I don't think they can handle having tables upstairs and downstairs, so I certainly wouldn't go back with groups of more than 4 and only if you can sit downstairs."}
{"text":"We headed to the waterfront with nowhere in mind, yet didn't really want to do a chain restaurant. Pulled up yelp on the high level bridge, found Dorthy 6 and just made the decision to check it out! Walked in to a friendly bartender, loved the ambiance, and really loved the vibe of the outdoor seating area. Long story short, service at our table was off to a really rough start and took over a half hour to  just get an appetizer in. Once the ball was rolling though, our server was very attentive and friendly.

Menu looked awesome and we had a hard time choosing! We settled on pierogies for an app and they were amazing! Shared a plate with 2 cheddar and 2 jalapeño; not greasy, nice and crispy on one side, and not overly doughy. I had the beet and arugula salad with added steak (cooked perfectly and very tender) with a house made orange/mint vinagrette and my friend had the flat iron which was also very flavorful and cooked right.

I'm sure will be back for more pierogies, to try more of the menu, and give the service another shot :)"}
{"text":"Lovely place! Quick service and their menu items were decently priced . Loved the chandeliers! I had a crab cake which was really fresh and over a bed of spinach (app) and my date had a burger. Quality food . However. 
Was in the mood for a mixed drink and the bartender said no he didn't make them (Mai Tai) all he had to do was look it up. I had their tropical rum special that basically tasted like run with sours. Wasn't very good. And my date asked for a Manhattan and it was hardly that. Food great but don't ask for a mix drink from the bar."}
{"text":"Great addition to 8th Avenue in old Homestead... lotta brews, the crab cakes are unbelievable. A cup of French onion soup was really tasty!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant/pub a few weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised by my experience there. The decor was very nice - they obviously spent a long time working on it. I wasn't able to see the upstairs section at the time, as it was closed, but was told that it should be available for parties in the future. The bartender was very pleasant, and took me outside and showed me their outdoor space. He told me of places for a firepit, and seating/tables in the warmer months. The draft selection is very good - I believe that there were about 16+ craft beers on tap. The food was the highlight of the night, tho. I got salmon cakes, pierogies, brussel sprouts - all of which were cooked perfectly, and the brussel sprouts were amazing. Quite possibly the best that I have ever had. I am so happy that Homestead has another quality place in main strip - this establishment will definitely help in Homestead's revival."}
{"text":"Dorothy 6 is worth the drive to Homestead. Though the menu is heavy on \"comfort food\" (meatloaf, pierogies, crab cakes), the food is definitely closer to fine dining than bar food. Sophisticated tastes and beautifully plated. We've been there twice - once when it first opened and a second time this past weekend, and were pleasantly surprised both times. The draft beer list is extensive and quirky enough to be fun. Take a chance - keep this place open - SO much better than dining in one of the chain restaurants at the Waterfront!"}
{"text":"Awesome Time on Saturday Evening. I am Not much for the light life type, however this feel of great service, cool atmosphere & Music and a curious outlook of all the different types of craft beer and the FOOD was to die for.  They even let you taste the beer before they served you a whole one .. just to make sure you liked it .. The BEST part is that it wasn't PACKED to the WALLS with people and nobody rushed you to leave.  We stepped out on the patio where they had a heated torch lamp to keep you warm ..
The seafood POT PIE was amazing and the fish sandwich I was told was excellent too. This is a TRUE BREATH OF FRESH AIR to Homestead and MUCH NEEDED..
I WILL be COMING BACK and telling EVERYBODY to talk to about this place.
Thanks to the owners ... I truly enjoyed my evening, close to home & NOT having to deal with the waterfront masses... Thanks Again & We WILL see YOU back real soon .."}
{"text":"My first time here, I remember not being impressed with the food. My second time, last night for Hungarian bacon night, I was again disappointed. I was looking forward to the bacon! There were a decent amount of people in the place with a Hungarian band walking around playing music. The bartenders seemed scattered as I waited for awhile at the bar for a drink. At the table, the server sat down on the booth and apologized for being lazy. No silverware, out of small plates, one of four Hungarian dishes were sold out... My table ordered the remaining three dishes-perogies, stuffed cabbage, bacon and toast. The bacon was very small pieces sprinkled on toast. That was sad. Overall, the food was mediocre and the service slow and unprofessional. I will not bother to return."}
