{"text":"Im here visiting from Chicago, Tried this place out and it was GREAT.  Everything we had was fresh, homemade and delicious.  Cant wait to go back and try the schnitzel!"}
{"text":"If you need catering, this is the place to go! Fantastic food and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great great place very welcoming of your not sire what to eat they'll help. The food is fresh and clean nice to sit and eat there will go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I love mediterranean food so I checked out this place last  week. It looks very modern and clean. I ordered a potatoe chop wrap and had to wait very long until I got it. And then, unfortunately, it didn't taste very good."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, authentic food with specials that rotate and add variety to the menu. I have always been treated AMAZINGLY at this restaurant, so I'm sorry to read the one star review and have to disagree. I went in with a friend and our to 6 month old babies and was made to feel completely welcome. I really appreciated the attitude as it's often intimidating to bring your baby to a restaurant. I'm so glad we did because it was a great experience and Wessen's is now one of my local favorites."}
{"text":"This place is honestly awesome. I'm worried that they won't last though because their location is kinda meh tbh. Food is god tier though and the lady's who run the place are awesome."}
{"text":"Visited here today on a whim and I'm glad I did. I was worried they were going to be expensive but was pleasantly surprised. I had the falafel wrap deluxe (falafel w/2 slices of fried eggplant and fries) and my husband had the chicken schnitzel. The restaurant was clean and the staff was pleasant. Everything we had was tasty. I have had falafel in quite a few restaurants in AZ and this is by far the best yet! Also, the eggplant was cooked to perfection and served hot so the texture was still spot on. My husband was just as happy. The chicken was breaded evenly and it was fried up perfectly, nice and crispy breading! As a bonus they gave us a sample of their potatoes and meatballs. Quite good and probably what our little guy will order when we come back! Definitely, worth giving a chance if you want to try some place new. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Incredibly clean inside and the owner is very friendly! Will be back!"}
{"text":"It is my pleasure to tell you Wessin International is one of my favorites. The staff is warm, friendly, and very accommodating. The menu offers the usual wonderful Mediterranean standards with a wide variety of fresh and tasty sides. Try the chutneys made in house to add a little spice to your meal. The popularity of Wessin International is clearly evident by the large following of regulars who frequent the restaurant for lunch and dinner. My favorite feature of this restaurant is the variety of specials prepared daily. For example, I tried the Egyptian staple, Molokhia. Not only was this dish tasty and nutritious, but I gained valuable insight into Wessin International's commitment to healthy and superbly flavored Mediterranean and indeed international presentations. Visit Wessin International. You will enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"So excited about this place! Fresh food is made to order (amazing shawarma and there is even SCHNITZEL). Some of the best tahini (nice hints of parsley). It's a gold mine 

What I love...
A) the food
B) the fact that I can buy kibbi, baklava, etc frozen and take it home and it it whenever
C) so fresh AND so clean...the vibe is on point. 
D) pick up your food and walk over to Sleepy Dog for a beer. It's a match made in heaven. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their Friday fish is a must. One of my favorite Arabic food restaurants. Keep the good food going!"}
{"text":"Third time I have had lunch here and I can officially say I love it! Everything is authentic and tastes wonderful, Wessen and her staff are very friendly and helpful. Willing to take time to explain menu and daily specials.

If your a fan of Mediterranean food or want to give it a shot I highly recommend you stop in!"}
{"text":"Came by at 8pm last night and they were closed, despite their website stating they are open until 9pm every night.  Too bad because based on the reviews I was excited to try it out.  This business should update their website and post their open hours on Yelp so there is no confusion and disappointment."}
{"text":"Best homemade Food  fresh & delicious , staff warm and friendly . Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is right across the street, and I couldn't be happier. I ordered for the first time today and I received an excellent recommendation for the falafel, and ordered Dolma as well. Their falafel is incredible, and the dolma salad is excellent as well. I highly recommend the green chili sauce. Their service is great, and the employees are genuine, friendly, and very knowledgeable on their menu items. I'll be walking over there a lot more often. Cheers to good falafel!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when looking for somewhere new to eat at lunch.  And let me tell you, it was such a great find!  

Me and my friend both got the daily special, which our server just called an \"upside down.\"  It consisted of some very moist and flavorful spiced shredded chicken, which was then layered with some eggplant and peppers and then covered with rice.  This was all placed into a bowl and cooked and then flipped \"upside down\" onto a plate so the rice was on the bottom and the chicken was on top.  It came with either a side salad, or a side of hummus.  Or you can opt for half salad/half hummus like we did.  The food was absolutely delicious and totally hit the spot.  Plus, we both left with enough leftovers for another meal.  

Our server, Sonny, was super helpful, down to earth, and fun to talk to.  Great experience all around -- I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I have had it on multiple occasion and all the food is great and interesting.  I highly recommend it for any event."}
{"text":"Great place. Very friendly and the food is authentic and fresh.  Went for the falafel. It was some of the best I've had"}
{"text":"Amazing food, creative combinations and plenty of options. Get the fried mushrooms for an appetizer."}
{"text":"Awesome food, and great service! It's a great place to eat healthy. Get the Greek salad with chicken kebabs, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Lamb euro and they literally brought me a plate with rice and chunks of meat! That is not a euro!! I had to ask for pita bread and toZieke sauce. There was a lady sitting across the room from me who ordered something that was not as described as well, I could hear her complaints but they would not refund her money. This place looks authentic and I was really excited but they have awful food and nothing is labeled correctly"}
{"text":"This place just opened up across the street and I had to give it a try. I walked in to a sleek and modern setup and was greeted by a very friendly staff including the owner, Wessen, who kindly welcomed me and informed me of the various unique menu choices. It was hard to choose between all of the delicious choices but I decided on the beef shawarma pita, which was topped by Wessen's special garlic tahini sauce. It was AMAZING. I can't wait to come back and try the falafel, kabob, and schnitzel!! Oh and they also offer homemade, frozen microwave ready foods! A delicious change from frozen pizzas and hot pockets. Try this place out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Mediterranean food anywhere. My girlfriend and I go in all the time, and we've never had anything less than an excellent experience. Everybody there is friendly and helpful with questions and suggestions, they are happy to see us and remember who we are, and most importantly, the quality of the food is unparalleled. Nice healthy portions and incredibly reasonable pricing with everything. Sunny even gave me a free baklava! Best food in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Randomly popped in looking for Greek/Mediterranean food for lunch.  Was pleasantly surprised by the simple menu, and made a great choice of beef shawarma sandwich.  Had to wait like 10 minutes as the dish was cooked to order in a saut√© pan which was brought out to a server who then grilled my pita bread.  Then I got to build my shawarma sandwich choosing fresh cut veggies and covering the whole thing in a delicious white greek yogurt sauce that had all the right flavors of garlic, cucumber and fresh herbs.  This was clearly the best stateside shawarma I have ever had, and I look forward to returning on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I noticed that this place opened near my work so I gave it a go. The menu is very small but I would rather have someone do a few dishes really well then trying to cater to everyone. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap and I got french fries on the side. The Chicken was really good and the fresh veggies were awesome. The sandwich had tons of flavor and the Hummus was great. The fries could have been more well done but overall I really enjoyed my food. They also have a big selection of Desserts that are ready for take away in the coolers. I intend on coming back many more times and trying everything!"}
{"text":"I was invited here by a cook I meet while getting a hair cut down the road.  The lamb was super tender and fell off the bone. Soup hit the spot, salads looked wonderful."}
{"text":"I was browsing the area for someplace to try and I noticed the amazing reviews for this place.  So with great anticipation I headed over there to see what the hype was all about.  Definitely worth the visit.  The beef shawarma was deliciously seasoned, the toppings fresh and crunchy.  The tahini was flavorful and aromatic.  Service with a smile.  Very clean and well maintained.  I will definitely be back for more.  Cannot wait to try the falafel."}
{"text":"Just amazing Mediterranean food! We stumbled on to it by cheer luck and I'll have tell you I was very impressed! Along with your typical delicious kabobs & shawarma, tabouleh, falafel, they make different fresh Home cooked meals everyday with s different menu. Very unique spot! See Sonny when you're there he'll extra care of you!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of local ME restaurants around ASU and this one is one of the best. Lots of variety, homemade, good quality ingredients, friendly staff, tons of seating and clean. 

I ate the special of the day, which was rice, potatoes, pepper and onion, eggplant, shredded chicken and the 12 -herb jasmine rice. It was a huge portion and very delicious. It also came with a choice of 2 sides for $11.50. Other plates start around $6.99.

Great for lunch and in a nice complex."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food I've tasted in town. They have off menu item called Mansaf it's my favorite."}
{"text":"2nd time here and it's wonderful..  please open fell Mediterranean restaurant.  You will do amazing.  The food is just wonderful.  The hummus and Falafel are so good!!!"}
{"text":"Wessen International Kitchen is awesome!  We went on a Tuesday evening.  The location is quite small, 3 tables inside and 1 outside.  While we were there, people came and went with their to go good.
The food and service was amazing!  There were 3 of us.  I had the falafel plate and my other 2 dining companions had the steak schwarma plate.  The first thing that comes out is a plate with the most delicious homemade hummus, a warm pita and salad with tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is the most heavenly balsamic.  I could have licked the plate.  Our salads were delivered by Sonny, a very humorous waiter, cook and cashier as he did all 3.  He answered all of our questions and gave us a sample of something we were curious about that we definitely will try next time.  
The falafel was cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside.  It came with 2 sauces and rice.  There was a tzatziki and another sauce that was delicious.   
Can't wait to try other dishes.  We will be back for the amazing food, service and jokes by Sonny.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! 
Great food and even better service! The pita bread is warm and buttery.
They have different specials every week so there's more to the menu than what's up on the wall."}
{"text":"This was my first (AND LAST) visit. I got the chicken kebab...it was over cooked, very dry, and the flavor was extremely sour. The hummus was runny and did not have good flavor and had a sour aftertaste. At least the salad was good, but it was less than a cup! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from me, just picked up a Greek salad with chicken and it's very delicious. If you order the same thing at Genos, you get half the amount and pre-chewed chicken for the same price. The chicken on a skewer was fresh and very tasty here. I'll be be back. This family owned establishment is a success!"}
{"text":"Great price, good food! I had gyro wrap, as always, my husband had falafel wrap, he enjoyed it very much! He just told me let's go there again soon! We had a dessert, it's ok for me, cuz I'm not used to sugar and cheese together, but husband liked it. Staff there are very nice!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place since I live down the street. I was greeted by a lady and the cook (Sonny) and he was very welcoming and nice. Had a conversation with him which was cool. He also gave me a sample of the rice bc I didn't know which to get. I ended up getting the combo plate of beef shawarma and chicken kabob with hummus and salad for $10.95. It was amazing. And for the price it was definitely worth it. I enjoyed he rice and the meats were really good, especially the chicken kabob. I would definitely come here again soon. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Found this little gem, and have been amazed at the quality. The menu is simple and loaded with flavor, truly homemade not a bunch of out of the box falafel and frozen pre sliced gyro meat. Eat on the the regular"}
{"text":"This place is great. I just got my first order and the food is fantastic with a very welcoming owner. You might not notice it driving by but it's definitely worth finding."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.

Easily the best falafel I've ever had in my life.  

Can't wait to explore the menu a bit more! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Really authentic cuisine, very, very yummy.  The only reason no five stars is the wait was too long, not that many customers, need to be quicker for those of us who need healthier lunches than B king and Micky D's.  If you have all the time in the world the food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. Best Mansef ever it reminds of my grandma's and my wife loves the shawarma. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! The pita bread is warm and buttery, the shawarma is juicy, and the baba ganoush and hummus have good flavor and consistency. I have yet to try the frozen take home food, but will do that one of these days. They have different specials every week so there's more to the menu than what's up on the wall. 

Tonight I ordered food and when I went to pay, did not have my wallet in my purse. The two ladies who worked there wouldn't let me go home hungry and gave me my order with my promise to come back tomorrow and pay. THAT's love for your customers. I'll definitely be back - tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Just had the vegetarian platter and loved it.  Super high quality food. Oh and if you leave out the pita bread, the dish is VEGAN!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bachamel pasta thru Uber eats! Tasted very good but it seemed like it was made few days ago and wasn't very fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY good. I initially stopped on the way home from work to eat at the restaurant a few doors down that was advertising gyros. Once I parked and saw this place I decided to try it out. First of all, the lady working was extremely friendly. She knew I was a first timer so she went over what everything only the menu and shared her favorites. Once I ordered, I realized that the meat is cooked to order and brought out from the kitchen in a skillet! Nice surprise. The steak shawarma wrap was amazing as well as authentic and I even got a free bottled coke. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This isn't a fancy place, and essentially adds up to Middle Eastern fast food, but for what it is, the quality is quite good.  If you're looking for Middle Eastern and Mediterranean fast and delicious, Wessen is the place to go.  It's in a kind of unassuming strip mall, and inside there's an informal arrangement of tables and chairs

There's always more down in the trays than there is on the menu above the counter, so be sure to ask what's there.  I ordered a combo plate of kafta kabob and chicken schnitzel.  The kabob was delicious.  The schnitzel was a little dry but tasty nonetheless.

There are fancier places nearby that have somewhat better food, but you'd go here for the same reason you go to the little taqueria or cheap Chinese joint--for something Middle Eastern that's fast and inexpensive.  For that, go here."}
{"text":"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS! Went in to try this place, based on the good reviews & location, and was not only extremely disappointed with the food but the worker there was SEXIST. 

The food was not fresh, was expensive (compared to Haji Baba), and was not good. Now for the worst part -- the male worker there refused to serve me, didn't want to answer my questions or even SPEAK to me because I was a woman. I was with my boyfriend and he asked my boyfriend for permission to look at/speak to me! TOTALLY RIDICULOUS. He said that in \"his culture\" he doesn't talk to women and can't even look at them without getting in trouble with their men.

I was SO OFFENDED & will never go here again."}
{"text":"Wow! The best baba ghanaouj I've ever had. Everything is very fresh and the highest quality ingredients. Tabouli has lots of fresh parsley and felafel deluxe with fried eggplant comes in a soft warm buttery puts. Very friendly staff and they do delivery. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Ok, I just can't give 5 stars unless there is ZERO room for improvement and judging by what I experienced today my update will be 5 stars.. My wifey is Lebanese and today's lunch felt like family Thanksgiving. Tray Kibbi!! not TRY Kibbi, It's Fuckin Kibbi in a tray, just how I like it! Get the fuck outta here!! AND they said they'd make the Kibbi for me, sans pine nuts, due to my allergies with no problem! I'm unclear if I should take my wife here or not, for fear that I may not get another home cooked meal, but does that really matter except I'm paying for it? I'm paying either way right? Oh boy, just eat here. You will not be disappointed. Did I mention they have grape leaves? Sorry to Genos next door, but I've fallen in love with someone else..."}
{"text":"Outstanding Middle Eastern restaurant! In a tiny strip mall next to a barber and smoke shop. The chicken shwarma is some of the most flavorful I have found nearby. Unfortunately, the beef shwarma was dry and lacking flavor. Everything is fresh and cooked to order and their pita wraps are made how you want it, with your choice of toppings. The falafel deluxe pita wrap is amazing,  with perfectly cooked falafel (not dry like most places) with homemade hummus and grilled eggplant. A must try!"}
{"text":"Food is FRESH! Best falafel I've ever had! Best eggplant I've ever had! The service was wonderful: patient, inviting and personable. The hummus was top notch. Great for take out, or staying in to eat (only about 6 seats inside, but comfortable especially if it's just you and a friend). I love supporting new small businesses - I was so glad we found this place!!"}
{"text":"delicous food, great and friendly staff and food came out quick ! thumbs up for me"}
{"text":"I went to Wessen with a party of 4. When we arrived, I was a little worried because the restaurant appears to be just a counter of food. At this restaurant, there is more than meets the eye! You order at the counter and then they bring the food to you in a separate dining room. It was hard to decide what to order as everything looks good. They have sandwiches on the menu all the time, and they have daily special items. Their special items come with two sides. I had trouble deciding what to order because they have so many tasty looking items. I got to try their lamb shank, their curry chicken, their falafal, their hummus, and their baba ganoush. It was all good, but the best part was when they brought some of their chicken in cream sauce (as I had expressed interest in it) just for us to try! Also, the chicken in cream sauce was by far the best item. The lamb shank was also awesome! Their feta...super good. Their falafal was just ok. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Arabic food since I moved to the USA outside of my mom and Teta (grandmother's cooking). You have to ask them what they have in the kitchen (off menu means mining to them). Traditional Iraqi food (kooba hamouthe, bamia, mansaf, biryani-Arabic style, Kubba mosel, moulikhiyya, fasoulia, etc etc.   we don't eat falafel and shwarmah in our homes in he Middle East...we eat Tabkhah, or Tabbeeqh....the home meals that take a day to make. I took two friends there, and we ordered almost one of everything that hey had made that day. All was up to Arab home food standard. Incredible. And they are the nicest people you will ever meet. They don't mind explaining all the dishes in the back kitchen. Shwarmah is street food. You have to try the home food."}
{"text":"Tried to place an order over the phone. Guy on the other side was saying stuff I didn't understand. After a good thirty seconds of being unable to communicate, he asks, \"Do you speak Arabic?\" I said, \"no.\" He hangs up. 

I go into the restaurant. Everyone there was speaking Arabic. No one helped me. It's a shame. Places like these are usually very friendly to all customers. I'll simply go to those places next time."}
