{"text":"Really enjoyed our time here. Employees were very accomodating and helpful! Atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to hang out with friends.  There are tons of games to choose from, a good wine selection, & hours of fun...for a $6.00 per person!  My husband hates board games, & I talked him into going to the 'Trivia Game Night' tonight, & we had a blast!  This is the best kept secret in Cornelius."}
{"text":"We are so happy we found this place! We went in on a day where they were having parents night. They had the children in a separate room with snacks and board games for them while the parents played in the front of the store. Their boardgames are well-kept and they are very welcoming there! We felt taken care of and really enjoyed the extra time off to play a boardgame while our daughter was enjoying herself as well. All around the board is a great date night idea or quality time idea to spend with family and friends. They cater to large groups as well as small. They also team up with food establishments around them and you can order in food while you play or you can order some of the snacks they offer there as well! They offer beer and wine as well as a selection of refreshments and snacks. We will definitely be coming back thank you for the amazing night out!"}
{"text":"By far, the best date night spot around!! And at an amazing price too! My fianc√© and I were excited to find a board game cafe and were cheerfully welcomed and made to feel at home by the owners. They were able to give thoughtful recommendations and were great at providing game instruction so you don't have to read an entire booklet first. There are games for every age and interest as well as plenty of snacks and two takeout restaurants closeby, so we stayed for over 4 hours! We even formed a bigger group towards the end, due to the friendly and cheerful environment. We will most definitely be regulars and can't wait to try out one of their murder mystery dinner nights!"}
