{"text":"I've been visiting this particular Lone Star quite often and have always enjoyed the food and the service. Also whenever I go it's not crowded and I like that.  The food is great and this Lone Star is very consistent in its quality. I order my steaks medium-rare and they're always cooked to the exact same standard.  For appetizers their Lone Star skins are amazing. Crispy with soft starchy potato and cheese, just perfect. The Taste of Texas sampler is a pretty big plate and has Lone Star Skins, Buffalo Chicken Tenders and Onion Rings.  The Texas Rose is a huge onion  cut and deep fried like a rose. It is very heavy and while it might look good it's sheer size and greasiness only make it viable for parties of 6+ people.  Their salads are nothing extraordinary but their ranch dressing is perfect: tangy and creamy, I wish I could buy it in the grocery store!   The steaks themselves are quite tasty and very juicy. I wasn't very impressed with the Porterhouse, It is a big steak but wasn't as tasty as I expected. It does fill you up though and you can't go wrong with it.  My top 3 choices are:  San Antonio sirloin for a relatively lean steak  Peppercorn Ribeye has an amazing sauce and the ribeye itself is very tasty  Five Star Filler mignon: probably the leanest cut they have, this is very tender and juicy.  You get to order 2 side dishes with your steak. Most of them are excellent.  With steak I always get the baked sweet potato with cinnamon-sugar and butter, it is a divine combination and i highly recommend it,  in fact I always have this with my steak!, Simple: YOU MUST HAVE IT!.  The lettuce wedge is a nice addition too, it has just the right amount of blue cheese  in the dressing to spice up the letttuce.  Creamed Spinach was somewhat bitter when I ordered it. I'd prefer it \"creamier\".  The mashed potatoes are lacking in taste somehow, they don't have that starchy creamy taste. Make sure you get it with bacon and cheese, makes a huge difference.  For dessert, the big brownie they have is extremely indulgent, it is a big size, easily feeds 3 people (maybe more) and the classic combination of the hot moist brownie with the cold ice cream makes this dessert the highlight of your Lone Star experience.  Every time the service has been amazing, when I go to Lone Star I usually have a certain server who has proved to be the most friendly and attentive I have seen in the valley so far. I'm not sure if Yelp allows to write a server's name so I can't mention who he is. Definitely A+ for service.  Overall a traditional steakhouse with good quality and consistent food, great service and decent prices. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"This is not our typical kind of place -- it is a chain steak house, with elaborate platters of fried appetizers and kind of beat-up salads. We came here after a long day of meetings and moving activities. My steak was better than I expected, though my salad was brown in places and the blue cheese dressing is super sweet. Sweetie liked the chicken fried steak. Our server was efficient and nice. We are especially appreciative to them because we forgot a credit card there for a couple of days, and they were very nice about giving it back to us."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff.. They have menu that is $20 for an appetizer and two entrees, great deal! you cant eat lunch for that cheap for two people. You can even get the Texas rose as the appetizer! The entrees always include two sides!! awesome food for an awesome price!"}
{"text":"as the others have said, i don't regularly frequent chain restaurants, but it had been a long day.  We were seated quickly, service was prompt.  My ribeye steak was cooked correctly, had good flavor and a nice portion size.  Salads and potatoes were also good, yet nothing outstanding.  not much to say that hasn't been already said by other reviewers."}
{"text":"A strip-mall chain.  It's not bad food, just a bad location.  Their version of a fried onion with dipping sauce is the same you'd get at Chilis.  The steak was cooked just as I ordered and the service was good.  This place is pretty much like a Longhorn or Outback, so if you like the two of those, give it a shot.  No complaints...just nothing special that's making me come back."}
{"text":"Not consistent. We have celebrated birthdays here for quite a few years, but the dinner we had on Sunday was not great at all. They made us wait 30 minutes before taking our tables order. After ordering, everything came out pretty quickly. The food, I had the Steak Kabobs, was not hot. I would say lukewarm. I ordered the kid's Steak Bites for my son, and the meat was well cooked, but again, not hot. The rolls, which come when you get your table, were tasty. The special desert they gave my mom and brother was ice cream with Hershey's syrup. Not good. See, just not consistent!"}
{"text":"Ick. Lone Star Steakhouse was nothing horrible, but they have nothing to brag about. Staff was kind, but they really just didn't have their act together. When we walked in the hostess smiled at us, but instead of greeting us reached to pick up the phone. The food was mediocre if that. I had a sorry excuse for tenderloins wrapped in bacon, and one of the steak fries on my plate had a big black spot...they couldn't have just thrown that one out? I'd been to this location a couple years ago and I remember everything being much better. What happened???"}
{"text":"Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great service and a nice menu.  Peanuts are provided for all tables, but no longer allowed to throw them on the floor.  The steaks are very good too.  They are nicely seasoned with a light cajun spice and served with lemon butter.  The seafood is limited to grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, salmon, crab topped shrimp scampi and shrimp and lobster sauce penne pasta.  The wait staff is great and its conveniently located in the Robinson retail area with lots of places to shop.  They have  a great selection of house drinks too.  The Texas Meltdown margarita was delicious.  There is a great kids menu too...and tuesday nights kids eat free(12 and under) with the purchase of an adult entree you get 2 free kid meals.  Monday nights is all you can eat steak bites."}
{"text":"So, its Friday night and we decide to drive 40 miles to try Lone Star.  I asked my daughter to call and see if she can get us a reservation since I hate to wait.  She made the call and was told that we didnt need a reservation and \"they would take care of us when we got there\".  Okay?   When we walked in to the Lone Star there was 3 or 4 couples waiting to be seated and I was told it would be 15 minutes.  I asked if they accepted reservations and was told \"only for 6 or more people\".  How nice.    We were seated about 15 minutes later and promptly waited on.  The server had no expression, no personality, no nothing....  Like a robot.    Our food was average and best and very salty.  It was nothing special and the bill was about $75.00 for two adults and two teenage girls.     We will not be returning...."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stopped here for a late lunch (around 2pm) while on the way to the airport. There was maybe one other group of people eating.   Our server was nice and friendly to us. I ordered the Bubba Burger ($8.49) because I was craving burgers. My coworkers ordered the Swiss & Mushroom Burger ($8.49) and the Perfect Chicken Sandwich ($7.99).  We waited a few minutes before we got our food. My Bubba Burger tasted pretty good and the steak fries were good, too.  Our waitress was nice and asked us if we wanted to refill our drinks.  I think she had one other table so she checked on both of our tables.  Good place to grab a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here and I must say it sucked. I had the 11oz sirloin with a sweet potato and a ceaser salad. The salad was served in a piping hot bowl. The potato was burnt black, and the steak I ordered rare came well. I suggest you find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 1:00 on a Sunday, seated quickly. Friendly server (Garrett).  The bread they serve was warm, moist and very good. I had a cup of chili, it was pretty good, had the right amount of spice, even my 8 y.o. liked it. We all chose the \"Sunday sirloins\" , wife and son had sides of broccoli and sweet potato . Sweet potato could have been a bit more flavorful,  but still was OK.  Steaks were juicy but not quite done right. More medium than medium rare."}
{"text":"Family and I thought this place wasn't too bad. Daughter loved their salads. Wife also enjoyed hers. Mine must not have been that great since I can not remember what I ate!!!! It has been ten days ago since we were there. But once again I am drawing an blank. The service was decent though!"}
{"text":"This is a chain... but most, if not all, Michigan locations have gone out of business.  Last minute work dinner.  I would have probably chosen someplace else, but I wasn't heading up our group.  OK glass of Merlot at the bar (small pour).  My dinner choice was the Signature Steak & Wedge Salad.  My companions both had larger meals, so their salads came first, while my whole meal came on a single plate.  The wedge was good, but bacon and blue cheese crumbles toppings were scarce.  I ordered the steak medium, but the pre-sliced pieces came out pretty well done.  Meat was tender and pretty tasty, so I didn't complain.  Our waitress/bartender did a good job, checking back just enough."}
{"text":"First time I didn't enjoy ribs.... everything else (service, decor, etc.) was fine. I know it is a chain, but I don't know if my experience was indicative of the whole chain or just this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are kids eat free!  I had a great classic burger. Hand pattied chuck grilled to meduim with american cheese and the fixins. Served with a wedge salad with some great blue cheese dressing. Even the bun was great. It hit the spot.   My daughter had chicken strips extra crispy, lol I guess she likes em like this.   Served with the peanuts and the bread it was a great meal."}
{"text":"The waitress Monica was verify friendly and attentive.  The burger was pretty good but nothing really noteworthy.  She gladly took my lunch coupon (got to watch those pennies now days) and when I thought the total was missing the deduction for the coupon she pointed out to it without making me feel stupid for missing it.  It took a bit to get the burger, but with her friendly service, I would be willing to stop in a again during my work lunch.  The restaurant was clean, they could have turned down the country music drawl a bit, but I think its part of their culture."}
{"text":"This follows on from my scathing review of the location on Bell road.    After cleaning the review I sent it into their corp office and had a phone call within a very short time. I declined a meal at the same location.There's something about praying to the porcelain god that puts me off a repeat performance.  Side note: When the Yard house stiffed us I suggested they give the cash to charity, a waitress or anything since we wouldn't be going back there.   Seemingly they can't so I gave it to the first person that answered my FB status. In short I don't want free anything I just want them to carry out their half of the deal and let us pay for, eat , and enjoy our food without rectal ramifications.   We ended up accepting a try out at of another Lone Star just off I17. I Didn't hand the letter from corp office to the manager at the start since we're  not interested in how  \"special cases\" are handled.     It's kinda a mixed bag. The server was really good, great with the kid and  timely with the delivery , checking and asked all the right questions.   Steak not cooked correctly  but they do ask everyone to check and it came back great, really really good steak.   Yet the transposed orders of the baked potato ( barely serviceable) Wrong kids meal , chicken strips instead of cheeseburger combined with a slowish service wasn't selling us future visits ( they are under 5 mins from the house)    They did take care of us by making up some soda to the kid's specs, not bad for a 3.5 year old to get a custom drink. It's 2.5 rounded up to 3 for experience . E.g  staff 4 stars, food 2 :)"}
{"text":"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.    Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.  Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :(   Entrees.  Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:)   Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned.   Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.  Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible:   Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)  1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots."}
{"text":"I love Lonestar. Great salad and bread and the steaks are a good size and pretty tasty.  Not a huge selection of beer though.  You get alot of food for a pretty good price, you'll definately be full after you leave, not sure why they even have a dessert menu."}
{"text":"Another FREE Entree from the E-club for my birthday!!  When we arrived at 8pm it was DEAD-on a Friday Night-so sad:(  Service was fast & friendly,   I love the hot bread loaf & butter they bring out so we didnt need any appetizer instead we had salads -a house & a wedge.  We then ordered Entrees  Delmonico 10ox Ribeye with Salted Baked Potato Texas Melt hamburger with grilled onions on Ciabata bun  The steak was fantastic -cooked perfect-fat trimmed and the baked potato was great too SALTED with LOTS of butter,sour cream & chives!!  The Texas Melt  burger was a completely different experience. The burger was from a frozen patty the cheese wasn't melted at all because the grilled onions were soggy & cold PLUS the bun wasn't grilled/toasted either.  I still gave it 4 stars for being FREE but its NOT likely this place with be open next year on my birthday!!"}
{"text":"This is a chain and should be thought of as such! Not the best I have every had but, the service was excellent. You have to get there at about 5:00 or wait for okay food, in a store-front location."}
{"text":"The steakhouse has become a whorehouse. The Tilted Kilt is the newest tenant. Lovely."}
{"text":"I'd give Lone Star a solid 2.5 stars, but the fact is they closed on September 13th, 2010. All of the servers, waitresses & bartenders I met the 15-20 times I went in there were friendly & attentive.   It was just never that busy there until the dinner crowd showed up. And often that crowd took up less than a quarter of the building. Lone Star was always in the shadow of Outback, which is just 2 buildings to the North.

{"text":"This Lone Star location has been closed for a few weeks, read:  http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2010/09/13/daily59.html"}
{"text":"I have been to this restuartant twice - both times the food and service was excellent.  The wait staff was extra friendly (could be that famous Texas hospitality)  The portions were Texas sized. I suggest trying instead of mashed potato/baked potato - try the Sweet Potato. It was amazing and much healthier for you than that of the white potatoe...but Try this place - it is just east of the Vegas strip.   Beats sitting at a noisey high price strip restuarant having to put up with sloppy drunks and cigaret smoke.  ENJOY!!!"}
