{"text":"Only one previous review for Harry's, and was not very good.  We passed by Harry's on Sunday evening around 7:00PM, and the parking lot was full.  There must be something here, so we decided to give it a try.  We were impressed by the decor, cleanliness, and by being greeted immediately.  We were served by a very friendly waitress, and ordered drinks.  With the drinks, she asked if we wanted to order now or wait, \so we decicdxed to look over the menu and wait.  When she returned, we ordered salads, and ask that the entree be delayed.  She said to let her know when we are ready for her to place the order.  We each had a filet, cooked to absolute perfections, with a great baked potato.  Prices are reasonable, and probably a bit under what you would expect for a steak of this quality and size. We will go to Harry's again when in Madison, and highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"First time visitors. At first the prices seem pretty high until the portions come. My husband had the seafood pasta and he raved on that. I had the chopsteak with grilled onions and mushrooms in au jus. Very good and plenty to take home for another meal. Entrees come with 1 side and a small loaf of brown bread. Our server Darri couldn't have been nicer. Friendly and prompt service throughout our meal.We will be back and ask for Darri."}
{"text":"Not impressed with service or food. Nothing wrong with it , I just think I expected a little more than what I received on both.   Sat in their \"flow over\" room that had no atmosphere or personality.   Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"The hostess was very rude and unfriendly when we were asked about the size of our group. My daughter's food came out last, 5 minutes after the rest of us had gotten ours. She had to send it back because the steak was bleeding all over her plate. The food is way over priced for the quality. The service was very poor! I do not recommend!!!! I will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Average at best. While visiting Hanover College with my son I took a recommendation from a local to try this place out. Wasn't bad wasn't great, just an average meal in odd surroundings. Started off with an appetizer combo. Some of the apps were hot; some were warmish. The ribeye was well marbled but the taste/ seasoning did not live up to the hype. The check for two of us was around 85.00 with tip."}
{"text":"Service was decent? Food is sub-par. Not much flavor, everything is breaded fried or covered in butter, and it's very expensive for such mediocre food. Plus, we got to enjoy swatting flies away from our food and beer while we ate. And everything is sticky and gross. I just kept wanting to wash my hands."}
{"text":"Delicious and good service. Food was ready in a very reasonable time, very calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love giving 5 stars. I can't even give 2 stars for Harry's. That brown bread before the meal? Find out where Outback gets THEIR bread and butter. My wife and I ordered salads. That should be easy. Right? Not for Harry. Lettuce and mixed greens turned out to be ALL iceburg lettuce for both of us. Not what the menu described. My wife's salad was VERY light on the mandarin oranges and cranberries. Our chicken in the salads tasted very strange. She thought it was processed chicken. I thought it might be spoiled. We will never give Harry another chance to feed us. He asked us how our meal was. We told him it was \"okay\" to be nice. His response was, \"are you picky?\" Haha. I dont expect Harry to improve the quality of his food with THAT attitude. There are MANY other restaurants in Madison to dine at, rather than be bait and switched by Harry's menu and cooks. 1 star is generous."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and decided to stop here for dinner. Ribs were good and the seafood pasta was good. Good portions. Staff was friendly. Our server, Kayla, was very nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Food was great and portions were WOW. Waiters and Waitresses were on top of it. We will definitely go back.  Atmosphere was really goid"}
{"text":"With all the great restaurants in Madison, don't waste your time and money at this joint. The food is terrible. It looks good on the menu, but not on your plate when it comes to your table. The owner is a smart alack on top of it. Go to one of the Top 10 restaurants instead. There are plenty of GOOD restaurants in Madison. Harry's isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Had a wedding rehearsal dinner at Harry's. The room was spacious and comfortable. The service was excellent and the food delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service is poor. Took a long time to get our food and then the waitress never came back to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"We had the Mahi-Mahi, chicken Alfredo and a kids chicken meal.  REALLY good food after hiking all day in the area."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, at best. The patio seating was cozy, but the service aspires to achieve slow status. Bathrooms were unclean."}
{"text":"Over all, a really good experience!  My server took a bit of time to get to me, but she knew she had been delayed and acknowledged it and apologized. I'd rather have slow and apologetic than slow and oblivious :) From then on, no issues with service.  My grilled tilapia was excellent. A ton of food for a good price, even though I added a side and grilled shrimp to what I ordered.   Definitely worth visiting again - there were several other things on the menu that sounded great."}
{"text":"Seafood pasta is amazing, salmon filet yum and the ribeye delicious. Full bar, and the outside patio is wonderful. Stop by and try my favs!!!"}
{"text":"We got there around 5 pm and already crowded - luckily just my wife and me, so we got a table.  Had the spinach and artichoke dip and it was the best I have ever had.  Only minor complaint is that I like the pita chips with that kind of dip and they served it with focacia but my wife likes bread better than chips so no big deal.  Had 10 oz. ribeye and it was perfect. Wife had ribs and thought BBQ sauce could be better.  Only other minor complaint was the salad.  Seems to be a local custom here that all the ingredients[onion, cucumber, & tomato] are chopped and placed in discrete piles on top of the lettuce.  What ever happened to the \"tossed\" salad?  Salad was OK but nothing special.  Generous portions so did not feel we could eat dessert. When we left at 6 pm, lobby was filled with people waiting for a table.  That should tell you something."}
{"text":"The address is correct but location on map is wrong. Our family of 5 with 3 children visited Harry's. We were greeted & seated quickly & our server was very pleasant. It's not easy to keep 3 boys entertained or at a volume suitable for a restaurant, so we put a movie on a tablet. I was a little worried how the server would react even though we did keep the volume very low. She was actually impressed that we'd thought of it & said, \"Dinner & a movie. Well that's a clever way to keep'em busy.\" Our food was great! We ordered two kids meals: chicken tenders & grilled cheese (made with Texas toast). For the adults: A full rack of ribs which were \"fall off the bone delicious\" and a New York strip cooked to perfection. All in all it was a fantastic meal & good experience. The only the we could've done without was a kitchen worker whose family had come to have dinner & bring her baby to visit. Would not have been an issue at all since our service was fast, friendly, & tasteful. She came into the dining room & hung out with her guests about 20 minutes, which again, wasn't the issue. Her \"uniform tshirt\" looked like she'd had it on about 2 weeks. It was the filthiest clothing I've seen on someone who's not homeless, yuck. Seeing that just made my mind wander about how filthy the kitchen must be. I'm sure my family didn't notice but it did make me cringe."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and portions were more than enough for one person. I had the club and was very pleased and surprised that it was served warm. My only issue was with the management.  There were 26 in our party and one waitress was assigned to our group Liz was fantastic but it's a shame that several other ladies were standing around with nothing to do and not offering to help her he fill drinks, take orders or bring the meals. This caused our visit to be a bit longer than necessary. I'll try it again when in the neighborhood and only hope that the staff are more team players."}
{"text":"We had an okay lunch here a couple of days ago. There aren't a lot of choices in Madison, but this place is okay. I should have known better than to have ordered the shrimp scampi pasta in a place that is obviously a steak and burger joint. My fault! Next time I will go with red meat. My wife had a fish sandwich and it was the standard, but the fries were good. The service was great (Thanks!!) and the atmosphere was actually funny. It is decorated in 1970s taxidermy. Imagine a Bass Pro Shop that serves Bob Evans food. That's Harry's Stone Grill. We aren't sure, but we think we overheard a fellow customer complain to a manager about all the stuffed dead animals. Really? I can imagine not liking that natural history museum feel but that's obviously the look the owner is going for so why complain? Just head on down the road."}
{"text":"Good food and service and they were actually washing the menus ( you have to read previous reviews to understand the menus thing). We will be back"}
{"text":"Tried harrys again. Ordered the sirloin med rare. Came out well done. Potato was done well. So come here if you want a potato but not so much for steak. New steak came out in a timely manner. And waitress was good. But, once again they fail. Go to 605 grill or any other downtown restaurant. If your dining in madison the hilltop disappoints every time. Go downtown!!!!"}
{"text":"Traveling to the area on business, had the large ribeye.  Steak was good, tender and tasty.  Bread, veggies and salad were also fresh.  Service was friendly, prompt and courteous.   Saw a previous review about a dirty menu, no issues noted, place was clean.  Meal hit the spot, I'd go there again...the only thing I regretted was having had steak and then seeing a plate of ribs being delivered to another table!!  Next time!"}
{"text":"First off...Deb the waitress is great!  Ask to sit in her section and tip her well.  The food is pretty good with exceptions.  The stuffed mushrooms were tasty and a little unique.  The stuffing was tasty though it was covered in butter.  The bread had no distinguishing taste.  I had the prime rib - which was very good.  My wife had the smothered chicken which was also tasty.  The salads were okay - nothing special, no homemade house dressings.  The mashed potatoes were okay as well as the side of green beans.  Don't order desert - the turtle cheesecake was awful!!  The facility was okay - lots of stuffed animals hovering over your head.  The bathroom was clean.  The host was friendly and there was plenty of staff to seven you.  The major downside started when they lost our reservation.  We had a certificate for $35 off our meal and free sodas and dessert.  This is a deal they booked with a local B&B to get people there.  They would only honor The $35 discount.  Overall we wouldn't go back there again anyway.  The reservation and refusing to honor this B&B deal they set up finished them off.  Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"We ordered ribs and chicken tenders and had a delicious experience. We are from out of town and heard Harry's was a good place for dinner and we agree!"}
{"text":"I've lived here about 2 years now I came up from Houston Texas looking for a good place to have a steak this is the place! I've had their fried pickles their Cobb salad everything is excellent!"}
{"text":"Cleanliness is not a priority at Harry's. The menus were filthy - I felt like I should wash my hands after ordering. We opted for the patio as it was a nice day. There was a bad odor and the patrons are allowed to smoke, which they do a lot of. They're also fond of swearing. And coughing. The patio doesn't get mopped often by the looks of things. It's concrete, but good grief - clean up after Saturday night's drunken free for all. Place mats are .99¢ rubber pads, and brown with filth. They're also in no hurry to bus the tables around you, happy to let the pile of chicken bones and cigarettes at the table beside you marinade to a ripe olfactory delight.   Prices are on the absolute maximum side of average, and the menu reads like someone's idea of upscale... upscale if you've only ever been to the Frisch's across the street. Or maybe Denny's. Out of about a dozen appetizers there was exactly one item that wasn't battered and deep fried.   We ordered sandwiches, as I was not willing to gamble $40 on a dinner at this establishment. To my amazement, our sandwiches were quite good, but if you don't upgrade to a different side, your chips will be a single serving bag of Ruffles. I kid you not. It's weird.   The dining experience inside might be quite different. I don't know and I'm not going to find out. The tattooed and pierced servers were sneaking kisses to their beer guzzling boyfriends who were seated on the patio, but still managed to be somewhat attentive to their customers. I can say that if you plan to eat on the patio, follow the lead of the locals and kill several brain cells first with a giant mug of cheap, stale American beer.   You've been warned.   Oh, last thing: the t-shirts the servers wear bear the slogan \"Hangin' at Harry's\" with a drawing of a noose alongside. Uhhhh..."}
{"text":"Better than nothing.  Better than fast food.  Sometimes you don't want to drive to L'ville, Cincy or Columbus, so sometimes better than an hour drive.  Don't expect much more than that.  Wouldn't be surprised to know that everything other than salad is frozen or pre-prepped.     Appreciate what they do in the community and functions they support, but this is nothing special."}
{"text":"We had a good experience for lunch.  Yummy starter bread.  Great portions.  Lovely, attentive waitress."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Harry's Stone Grill and found it to be less than average. The server was less than attentive, and the food was expensive for the quality. I had a New York Strip and I asked for it to be cooked Medium. It was cooked to what I think was rare-medium rare. The baked potato was old, and the steak was tough and had a lot of gristle. Overall, for the money spent, I feel like I had been ripped off."}
{"text":"General, I am pleased with Harry's Stone Grill. I went for lunch with a friend. We both got the Cobb Salad. As we were eating, a nat flew out of her salad. She was repulsed as was I. We told told the server, she got the manager to come over. The manager stated it was normal for restaurants have this problem. We spray for bugs. Which is totally fine and understandable. The manager gave her half of her salad. I wish I would told my friend to walk out and not pay. I'm kind of disgusted that any restaurant would ask for any payment in this situation. I paid my bill but will not return because this unacceptable and disgusting customer service. Management had something to be desired."}
{"text":"Took a chance after reading prior reviews and grateful that we did - everything was fantastic! Salads were plentiful and fresh, steak and fish were good portions and cooked to perfection - all were flavorful and of a higher standard expected for the price point.  Service was friendly and attentive as well.  Definitely worth the visit!"}
