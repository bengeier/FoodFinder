{"text":"Love their food, hate their prices, too much for too little food. Not worth it as the specialty is really in their sauce."}
{"text":"Food was good, but worst service ever. Tables were dirty, no napkins drinks took forever to come."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION. Me and my family ordered in for dinner ($53 worth) and upon asking for extra hot sauce for our meal, were rudely declined. The employee insisted that they gave me sauce in the bag, and even after checking and politely asking for more, the rude staff said \"I already gave you 8\". Baffled and confused we left, vowing to NEVER go back to this terrible, rude, unacceptable service.   Thankfully a manager from the richmond hill location followed us out and offered us a free meal at his location, agreeing that what he just witnessed was unacceptable. If you're thinking about going to the markham location, think again if courteous and polite service is important to you."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 Service 3/5 Atmosphere 2.5/5  Food 1/4 chicken (thigh and leg) with corn and peri peri fries. Fries weren't as hot as I liked, probably because it was a busy Friday night, so we had to wait awhile for our order. Chicken was done perfectly, I got it hot. It comes in extra hot, hot, medium, lemon and herb and mild. They also have additional sauce at the side, free for people to take to their table. Word of warning, the garlic sauce is spicy as well. My friend who can't take spicy had to find out the hard way.  Service Order at the counter, and find yourself a table. They will bring you the food when it's ready. This is a half fast food kind of joint, so there's not much to say about the service. Just a little slow.   Atmosphere Looks like a nicer fast food restaurant. The one in downtown has much better decor. I personally prefer the one in downtown.   I'm probably going to stick to going to the one in downtown because I never had an issue with the temperature of the food, and I like the atmosphere there better. But if I get a craving for nando's and don't want to commute downtown, I will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Complaint about Nando's @ 150 North Queen Drive, Etobicoke ON for June 2, 2016.   12:30pm arrived. Oh man, where do I even start?? I ordered over the phone and let the guy on the phone know that we were going to come in and eat. COME IN AND SIT DOWN AND EAT. He said sure no problem. We got there within 12 minutes. He said it would be 10-15 minutes. So we get there and I stood in the cash line to let them know I was there. I was ignored so then we approached a girl who worked there and told her that we had ordered over the phone and asked if we should pay first or sit, she said she'd seat us and then bring us our food.  We sat outside on the patio and waited and waited and waited. No one approached us, asked us for our order ...NOTHING. So I decided to go back in @ 1pm and ask the same girl again as to where my food was. She said she was told not to serve anyone and to just clean but she'll go and ask someone in the back. So we're still sitting there 15 minutes go by. A different server keeps walking by us the whole time but not once asked if we have been helped or anything. No one has even offered us a drink yet.  The girl now comes back and brings us our food, which is cold. Four of us in total, all of our food was cold.  Still no one has offered us a drink.  The same server passed by again and I asked her for some water. A different server comes out and brings us water with only 3 glasses when there are 4 of us. He says he'll be back and doesn't return.  It's now 1:50pm we go in to talk to the manager and pay. She is ignoring us the whole time and then finally when she does stop to talk to us, gives us attitude and talks extremely rudely. Absolutely no customer service skills what so ever. She said were not supposed to call in orders and then come and sit there and eat and that calling in is only for takeout.  Another co-worker / friend of the \"MANAGER\" was sitting there on her day off. Telling my co -workers and I that they are so busy and blah blah blah, when there was only like 15 people max in the restaurant.  She told us it was her day off. My question to her is , if it's your day off what the hell are you doing there??? Most horrible experience I have ever had in my life. I have never in my 30 years written a complaint on anyone.  I will never return to this Nando's ever again. That so called \"MANAGER\" needs to be fired or dealt with or something. Perhaps a customer service course on how to speak to a customer would be a great start. So disappointed..............waste of my lunch hour and a waste of my life."}
{"text":"Nandos is not usually bad but this location sucks! I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken. The dish came pretty quickly... however it was downhill from there. The chicken tasted like it had gone bad. As if it was was sitting out for a long time and they just drizzled it with peri peri sauce and brought it out. So I avoided the chicken and took a bite of the croutons. I think i almost broke a tooth bitting into that crouton. Definitely not fresh. So i decided to just send the plate back and be done with it. I explained to the server the problem with the chicken. Instead of listening and being polite she responded very rudely. Even the chef didn't care. She brought my plate back and asked me if i was sure the chicken was bad. I told her to try it..and she didn't want to so yea I'm pretty sure the chicken had gone bad."}
{"text":"Amazing South African/Portuguese cuisine. There are numerous locations in the GTA but Nandos is a can't miss when you come into town. The spicy double leg with peri peri fries is a classic. If you're going with a friend the variety meal is a also good."}
{"text":"I think I may have come to this place during a bad time. The service was extremely slow. The food was delicious though. I love Portuguese Cuisine so I was looking forward to this place. I tried their Peri fries and it was Ok. Could have been better but slightly over-cooked to my liking. The chicken was really good and I was impressed.  The only thing is the location. Since heartland is so busy all the time, it took me about 5-8 minutes of my 30 minute lunchbreak to find this place. I literally only had 5 minutes to eat before heading back to work.  I would give this place another try but i'll probably bring my family with me this time. Not really a good place to go if you're tight on time"}
{"text":"The food is great (stay away from the coleslaw though) but the long wait just for seats is excruciating."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I loved the service and food that was served to my little one and husband. I was greeted right when I walked in and was seated quick. The hostess explained how everything worked very clearly, which makes the experience a lot more better.   The art work around the place is beautiful as we walked around to see it. We were told they were brought from south africa which is pretty cool!  We had bought the classic plate which includes one whole chicken, a large side and some garlic bread for about 30 dollars which is really good for feeding 3 hungry people :) I had also met with the manager Melissa and she is the sweetest person.  Overall, this place is really good and I would recommend it to my family and friends. p.s. reading all these bad reviews will not summarize the experience I had. You should go and check this restaurant yourself! You will love it. The only bad thing I would say is that a couple of portions of sides are not too filling but still good."}
{"text":"Love this place, fast and the chicken is delicious.  The washrooms are clean and very friendly staff.  The rice could bit too moist, I like the rice a little more dry."}
{"text":"The chicken was juicy and moist.  It was also cooked for perfection.  The sauce had a nice flavour and kick to it. It was kinda salty for my liking but I got used to it after a couple of bites.  The salad tasted fresh and crisp. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The one star is there for the food.  The missing four stars are not because of the restaurant's scowling owner. While it took about 25 minutes for our food to finally come (we got takeout, two orders of half chicken with fries/rice) in a mediocre busy restaurant, she kept badgering us to sit down. I think I can decide on my own if I want to sit down. Can I mention that she didn't even give us cutlery with our orders? Oh and don't bother asking for extra sauce, this restaurant is too cheap to provide you with anything more than two packets for a HALF chicken, for those who love Nando's sauces.  Also had a lady complain to her that her friend was waiting for about 30 minutes for a half chicken and fries, and you guessed it, no apologies ..just a \"wtf are you talking about\" look and her banging at the kitchen staff (lol).  I've come here about three times now, and all three times were pretty miserable experiences, dine-in and takeout alike. One time, it took about 30 minutes for an order for two people .. and we were the only ones in the restaurant!! Unbelievable.  I'd like for this location to be open, but HQ should really withdraw the license from this franchisee, I mean look at all the reviews below?!  Oh by the way, why is that every time I want to order the double leg dinner, it's NEVER available???? But they have half chickens available???"}
{"text":"Watch out for the cashier's bad attitude. I encountered a really rude cashier today. She ignores my questions regarding the menu and made the wrong order even after I confirmed my order before payment. Other than that, the food is good."}
{"text":"I was really excited for the food to live up to the hype but I was very disappointed! I ordered a peri peri chicken sandwich and the portuguese buns were rock hard- like it hurt to chew. My mom ordered a chicken pita wrap and there were barely any veggies in it, just a massive chunk of chicken breast. We also got a side of garlic mashed potatoes which were just awful, it tasted like it was just taken out of a microwave. Overall, I felt like this place was very overpriced and a waste of money. The only thing we could all agree on to be delicious were the peri peri fries!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the food, but they never open on time.  Today I called @ 12:15 and was told to call back because they won't open until 12:30.  Even tho their phone message and website state they open at 12 on Sundays."}
{"text":"Called for pick up. Still had to wait 30 mins for the food to be ready. Went to the cash to double check my order,since staff were just talking around and on the phone. Turns out,my food has just been sitting there. Service is really slow as staff are just seen talking and standing around. I would never dine it in this place. Since  the wait time is very extensive due to poor service."}
{"text":"After eating at other peri-peri chicken places....Nando's feels like fast food. This location is always crowded and the way the tables are set up, it doesn't feel much like a restaurant.  Of course the chicken isn't bad but the sides are a bit mediocre. The prices aren't all that great if you're eating in a family and I've found better food options in Heartland (as well as better Portuguese Chicken places like the one on Hurontario/Brunel and the one on Central (Galitos?))."}
{"text":"Best part about Nandos is the spice selection if you like spicy fare. The menu and quality is otherwise just typical fast food chicken"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. I was sitting in the dining area and no one was there and also very very empty and very rudely they told me to move to near the front door. Just for the customer service I would rate this a 0"}
{"text":"The chicken here was good but nothing out of the ordinary. After hearing so many rave reviews I set my hopes up high. I probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews of Nando's from family in London, England so when my brother, sister and I went by one, we were excited. We looked at the menu displayed outside and decided to go in. Upon entering, it was nice and airy. We stood by the door for a few minutes but noticed that people were coming in and seating themselves so we did too. After a few minutes of waiting and looking around for a server, my sister and brother saw that people were lining up at the counter to order so they went up. Apparently, you get your table first then give your table number when you order. I think it would have been a good idea to post that sign somewhere at the entrance for newcomers.  My sister ordered the Variety Plate (Half a chicken + 5 whole wings + 2 skewers + 2 regular sides. Perfect for 2-3 people.) She was told they were out of chicken wings. The option was to substitute and extra order of a side dish. Sorry, but a meat dish and a side dish are not equal. We felt cheated. A better solution would have been to suggest an alternate meat or plate.  When the food arrived, we were disappointed by how small the portion sizes were for the price. My brother could have eaten the whole plate by himself. The chicken itself was moist but it did need extra sauce to make it tasty. The rice and vegetable side dishes were bland. The substituted potato side dish was at least decent. We all agreed that we would not go out of our way to go to a Nando's again.  Our experience did not sit well with us. When I got home, I filled out their online survey and one of the question asked if I would like to be contacted regarding my dissatisfaction and I said yes. I gave them my email (I don't have a phone since I'm here visiting family) and waited for them to get back to me before posting my review on yelp. It's been over a week and nothing. I guess they don't really care about customer service. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Well, we won't be coming back.  Nando's just opened up in one of the newly built stores across from Walmart and Sherway Garden.  We usually go out for dinner on Sunday's and since we were passing by we decided to give it a try.  Let me just say that the set up/service of this restaurant is rather odd/ineffective.  We were greeted at the door and taken to a booth where it was explained to us that we could look at the menu and decide what you wanted, but then you had to come up to the cash register to order but someone would come to serve you your food.  For the 3 of us with glasses of wine it came out to close to 100 dollars which for a place of this calibre is kind of ridiculous (and I/we are people who are used to spending lots of money on dining out and quality food).  The annoying thing is that you have to pay for your meal at the beginning when you order it, before you have received any food or service...and it asks you for a tip!! This was irritating, as you are expected to tip before having any type of service...  Anyways, had a hummus and red pepper dip to start with pita, and 3 peri peri chicken wings.  Both of these apps were pretty average.  We all had some form of the peri peri chicken with a couple of sides each.  The chicken was average and one of us thought it could have been cooked longer.  One of my sides was the cole slaw which was absolutely drowned in mayo and super soggy.  The portion sizes weren't too big actually, you would get more from a basic chain restaurant like Swiss Chalet!!  Getting a waitress to get you water or something is very difficult, most were talking to each other or nowhere to be found.  We decided to try the pasteis de natas for dessert, and I was already expecting them not to be authentic of very good.  Just to get a waitress to come and ask for 2 de natas took 10 minutes, and it took close to 20 minutes for them to bring them to us! We had to get up and ask a waitress where they were and were told \"oh she wrote them down\" and then they came out a minute later with mumbled apologies.  People are certainly right that the whole service and ordering situations here are a huge issue.  The two pasteis de natas were small, had almost no browning on top, lacking in flavour with soggy bottoms.  Overall this was one of the more unpleasant restaurant experiences I have had in a while.  It was just too much hassle, strange, overpriced and just not very good.  If you are looking for an affordable dinner seriously just go to Swiss Chalet or something instead LOL. And if you are looking for authentic Portuguese food in Toronto then certainly do not come here!!!!"}
{"text":"I predict this place will be out of business soon. Chicken skewers were ridiculously tiny, and the taste was meh. The place is waaaaay overpriced (although i don't mind paying a lot for good quality). Never again. The interior is nice, but what's the point if you can't get good food? I hope the negative reviews will become a wake up call for the owner."}
{"text":"Food court experience, rude and understaffed, overpriced as hell.    Terrible place. I have no idea how this place is so popular and talked about often.  Came on a weekend with another person. While a lack of table service isn't great, the concept makes sense if the rest of the operation is FAST, but this experience was anything but.   Entered to a completely packed waiting area - no system to separate people waiting for take out, for tables, and just waiting around. it was completely hectic  Waited a ridiculously long time to get a seat. Staff does not show you to table so it results in people clambering around entrance and running to spots like a food court.   Both serving staff and staff who took orders were incredibly rude. The entire seating area was understaffed, with one staff member in charge of bringing out food, wiping tables, and filling water glasses. This place is clearly cutting cost by only having 1 staff on a weekend managing all this. Obviously as a result our water glasses were never refilled and I had to ask to have the dirty, crumbs and leftovers from the previous table cleared from our table.   After waiting a very, very long time, were presented with our meals (quarter chicken meal). I have never been so underwhelmed in my life. A simple plating of chicken, a small, insulting amount of fries/mashed potato, and a small, humble corn on the cob. The plating and portions were a joke - could never imagine the price assigned to it would yield such a tiny amount. Especially in a place like Mississauga where there's a bevy of ethnic foods and chicken places.   The chicken was good and had a different taste - but the combination of all other factors ensures I'd never return despite this,.   Ate while having a crowd of hungry people watch the table as there isn't a clear division between waiting area and the seating area."}
{"text":"Been eating at this location for several years . 9/10 times haven't had any complaints . The odd time there might be one but usually food is fresh, hot, and delicious ."}
{"text":"The place has a sink in the dining which is very convenient. The chicken is very tender and the sauces are great. The sides could be larger.  Despite going to the front to order and getting your own utensils the staff were on point and very helpful."}
{"text":"Forget all other chicken places, they have the best rotisserie chicken ever, love the sauses. Good service, very polite staff."}
{"text":"The chicken and sides are delicious, but service is chaotic. I've been to Nando's around the world, so I know how their ordering works.  While it's not the usual way for restaurants in North America to get up and order at the counter after you have your seat, it's much worse at this location than others I've been to.   The food, when you finally get it, is great but the service really degrades the whole experience."}
{"text":"OMG this was the worst experience at a restaurant ever - our first visit - totally ignored by all staff-staff not smiling-customers lined up and Manager ignored them - overheard orders were wrong-no one to seat customers - we had to ask to be seated- a lot of staff hiding behind the counter and not helping customers or each other-no apologies -we decided to leave after 30 mins, and I told the manager off, and he was defensive, said hejust got back from his break - who cares just do your job and tell the staff to get off their ass and help customers - you are losing customers - two groups got up and left too,also fed up with lousy service, you don't deserve my money"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Nando's I have been to.  From the taste of the chicken it seems they first boil the chicken before grilling. I love grilled chicken and was excited to have Nando in the neighborhood, but they should stop cutting corners, do they think our taste buds are so bad that we will not catch on to what is being done. If I want boiled chicken I would do it myself."}
{"text":"Would Not recommended this dodgy place I had a similar experience as above where they denied a valid entertainment book coupon. Why advertise something and then have the nerve to try substituting it for a meal that's half the value of the coupon?? I decided not to give them any of my business now nor any in the future. I don't know how the food is, but as a business they are a failure."}
{"text":"I understand the busy environment on a Friday but with it being such a small restaurant, it was very loud and hard to socialize. The front foyer was constantly crowded with people either ordering or picking up take out. Would highly recommend takeout next time.  Two of our children had the chicken strips (kids meals) and both complained it was too spicy for them even though we ordered it plain. One other child ordered the sliders and it came out later than everyone else's dish. We were half way done eating by the time he got his. He didn't like the sliders and only ate the bun. They also charged us $2.50/each child for their apple juice and IMO should be included in the kids meals. The kids got free frozen yogurt with their meals but it came out liquid (soup texture) so we ended up going elsewhere for dessert.  The Adults all ordered 1/4 chicken (with 1 side dish). The chicken tasted good but tiny portion sizes for how much we paid. You can definitely get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store with ALOT more meat. I don't like the fact that you order at the desk yourself and pay right away. With paying right away, you end up tipping before you even have you dining experience because I probably wouldn't have tipped so high had I know the bad experience we had. I understand this is the way they run their business, but just a heads up when you go to order."}
{"text":"Two of us ordered quarter chicken meals, my portion was almost half smaller than my friends. I asked the server about it and she just shrugged it off saying they come that way sometimes. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Well. The food is consistently decent and it's very family friendly. The staff are friendly and they try really hard.  The problem is that they are painfully slow. And be prepared for them to mix up your order.   I feel that after thIs much time in business, they should have had the bugs worked out by now.   We keep coming back because we all like the food, but I wish they'd get their act together."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.....the service is nasty, the people working there look unhappy and most importantly this whole company is filled with Liars. My family and I love eating out especially with our Mom as she is sick and love spending time with her and making her happy by taking her to places she likes to eat. Nandos USE to be one of them. To start off, our experience at the Eglinton location was terrible. The wait was about twenty minutes long and after all that wait we basically lost our $50 of food. We ordered the whole chicken with the sides and a few other items. After the forever wait we got a few pieces of chicken,,,,I thought we paid for a for chicken? Or is this Africa you ask for a cow and get a goat instead? The waitress reassured us that our side orders were coming, they did not coming...after bragging and asking a million more times she brought this nasty cesar salad....cold and not fresh than she brought us the fries....sorry I mean the plate was literally empty...I was so pissed off I put my piece of raw chicken down and got the waitress and told her to get this off my table I could have been sick from e-coli eating raw meat...she went and got me a burn piece of chicken...after all this drama and bullsh** we ended up leaving. My mother is on dialysis so she has to walk slowly so imagine taking all that time coming in and now leaving without eating. The waitress and the other staff members did not even try to make it more comfortable and more experiencing. I eat out a lot and Nandos IS OFF MY LIST FOR GOOD."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if our experience had to do with our table location but we had a horrible Saturday night experience.   We sat at the high table near the kitchen. The service was non-existent. We ordered the Variety.  The chicken was good and plentiful. But it took 35 mins to arrive at our table. And that was after we asked a random staff member to check.   When I paid for the food, I asked for two glasses of water.  The lady pointed at the soda machine and stated someone would bring us our glasses. We had to stop a staff member and ask for water after 10 mins of waiting.  She then proceeded to give us a large bottle of water (chilled) from behind the cash register. Not sure if the staff knows how the restaurant is to run.   Again food is good. I've been to other Nando's around the world.  This location does not have the quality of sides I've seen elsewhere. But chicken is fine.   Once we were ready to leave, I asked for a to-go container. the guy must of forgotten and that took another 5 mins.   1-1/2 hours later we were done and out the door.  Will I be back...yes. This area needs more restaurant choices and I do hope their service gets better."}
{"text":"This place is so, \"hit or miss,\" with both the food and service. Actually, the service has been brutal the last few times we have gone. We don't even both trying to sit down in the resteraunts for a meal...that's too frustrating. No one brings water, food comes with no cutlery...all small issues and can be easily be taken care of...if anyone who worked there gave a  #*!#.  But we loved the food so we decided to do take out and give it another try. This was also a big mistake. And in my opinion, the value just isn't there. For example, a family meal (for 4), comes with the smallest salad that I have ever seen. it was smaller than a side  salad for one. They charged an extra dollar for caesar, and I wouldn't mind, except that it was literally some sad iceberg lettuce...that's it! If I owned this business, I would be spending a lot more time there making sure it was run properly. also, they need a better system. It's confusing. If I want to keep getting up from the table, I can just eat at home. Thanks."}
{"text":"My chicken couldn't be more seductively dressed ! It's grilled to perfection with ample peri peri sauce - I like it in mild. You can pick any number of side dishes  and they do have a good variety to select from!  This is my idea of comfort food. Mmmm delicious!   Oh & the owner at this location is very courteous. Despite being a fast food chain, he will walk up to your table to ensure you've no complaints.   I am deducting a star off for that awful rice they serve! Why is it still on menu at all locations?????"}
{"text":"I visited this location today and found their service and food to be better than other locations. The staff is super friendly and they offer good size portions. This will be my nandos of choice in the future!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Nando's.  I ordered the Chicken medium with a side of Butternut Squash and my wife ordered the Quinoa Salad.  The Chicken was very good but it was not the chicken I ordered, they forgot to put the Quinoa in the salad and the bits of squash in the salad were too Spicy for my wife.  When I informed the server I was offered my original choice but I refused because it throws the timing of the meal off.  No other offer was made."}
{"text":"Nando's was delicious! It's very rare my picky partner compliments a meal, but he said it was the best chicken he's ever had. I concur with his statement.  The chicken was good (even with the lemon and herb sauce). The only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is the potatoes. Those kinda fell short for me. Other than that everything was perfect.   Also if you get the combo it's well worth the money and you might be able to save some for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm not Portugese, so take it with a grain of salt.  The chicken for the most part is pretty delicious.  The peri-peri sauce is the reason I make repeat visits.  Price-wise, it seems a bit higher than usual for chicken, especially as home-cooked chicken is easy and tastey.  My advice is to go for the double leg - make it spicy as well - it has a good kick that flavours the meal.  The spiced rice is a must, and if you can, get the peri fries as well.  Simply astounding.  Don't go for the chicken wings pack - last time I tried that I found that the chicken wings were small, dry, and somewhat questionable shapes.  Other than one visit, most other visits were timely and quick."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken is great. I get to choose the level of spicy I like. The service is friendly. Lots of sides to choose from.  reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about. I work in the same plaza as this place and I come here twice a week and I feel like the food is bland and is average to below average, its a good place to get lunch if your only choice is this and mr. sub. the atmosphere is tacky, cheap and the service isn't that great, I don't know why they're always yelling, the place isn't very loud so when ever I put an order in and the guy starts yelling im just a little confused. I CAN HEAR YOU! YOU DONT NEED TO YELL !! lol"}
{"text":"I've been to Nandos twice so far. First time I actually really enjoyed it. Service wasn't bad at all and the food was delicious. I couldn't wait to go back but then the second time, I was unsatisfied. It took about a hour to get my food. My husband and daughter go theirs 45 mins into us waiting. Mind you the waitress knew that I still needed my food but never made it a priority to get me my food. 50 mins into me waiting for my food they gave me my corn that had been sitting there the whole time on the counter which was now cold. I had to go tell someone else that I never got my food. The other lady made it a priority and got me my food 1hr later. I really do like their food but the service needs to be handled."}
{"text":"Wow! great food! I stopped in for a quick bite and I have to say that the food was delicous. I could smother that garlis peri peri on everything!.  Ambience is okay but it is just a stopover for a quick bite so I cannot complain about that. I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because the atmosphere looked great and the menu seemed tasty. I ordered the chicken skewers, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The potatoes and slaw was good however the chicken had very little flavour - other than some hot sauce which really tasted like Franks hot sauce. I expected WOW this is good but didn't get that. The big big con in the meal was the chicken was undercooked. In fact the second skewer I started to eat I had to spite out - it was pink RAW CHICKEN! bad!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Nandos I finally decided to visit this joint since I live 2 minutes away.  This location has somewhat of a awkward table placements; maybe I'm just weird lol  Their menu is quite limited but thats a good thing for indecisive patrons like myself.  I tried all their spices of chicken and fries but nothing wowed me like what I have heard.  I might have set my expectation a little too high for Nandos.  The quality is definitely there but the recipe can use some tweaking.  I left feeling a little disappointed and sort of wish I had spent my money on Popeye's chicken or KFC; I know I know its not the same but they all specialize in chicken.  Lots of people love this place so I probably recommend this restaurant to chicken lover who havent been to Nandos."}
{"text":"The chicken is consistently very good. Beautiful char on the skin, which lends a smoky flavour to the meat. Succulent, juicy, just perfect.   I like a bit of heat but nothing over the top crazy, so I always opt for the medium sauce which is basted over the meat while cooking.  The accompanying sauces at the table are stellar and strike the perfect balance between savory, spicy, and acidic notes.  Speaking of which, if you're giving this place a low rating, because you don't get as much sauce as you want with your order, shame on you. If you dine in, there are bottles of sauce on the table that you can pour to your liking. If you're taking out, don't be cheap, just buy a bottle of the sauce on the side. I mean, McDonald's charges for extra sauce, so why wouldn't Nando's?  I come to this location infrequently, though each time I've visited, I've had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I'm sad to see that a number of other Yelpers did not have a positive experience here. I have only been here once and went with a large group of 14 for dinner. We ordered 3 party packs which included: 6 whole chickens (yeah...our group can eat a lot lol!)  6 large sides plus a ton of garlic bread and drinks. The owner helped us pick what kind of chicken and sides to get and we decided on a combination of Lemon & Herb, Medium and Hot. For the sides we just got half fries and half rice.  The food: the chicken was actually really good! Very moist and flavourful (without the sauce even) and showcases the fact that their chicken is marinated for 24 hours before being flame-grilled and basted with their peri-peri sauce. My favourite was the Lemon and Herb chicken while others loved the Hot chicken. The fries and rice were ok, nothing to boast about.  Overall we had a great time at Nandos. We were extremely loud but I think they noticed we were celebrating a birthday so they didn't bother us to quiet down. Sorry to the other patrons who were eating there that night :P  Lucky for them we didn't have to split the bill. Would definitely come back to this place if I'm ever craving flame-grilled chicken. Hopefully I don't experience any of the negative aspects of this restaurant mentioned by other Yelpers. *crossed fingers*"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Small portions. $85  for 4 ppl including tip. Just the sauce spread all over the chicken.  The chicken itself not very flavorable. Will not come back. Swiss Chalet across the street highly recommended compared to this location. Also upon leaving we notice something underneath the table.  It's a cockroach.  Don't go here. Cockroaches mean dirty...dirty..dirty."}
{"text":"Expensive, extremely slow, and the piri piri sauce is not anything to write home about. I was hoping the chicken would be authentic churrasqueira, but sadly no. Outside of the sauce and the pasteis de natas, there's nothing Portuguese about Nandos."}
{"text":"in response to Sajid R's post :   Nando's is a restaurant chain originating from South Africa with a Portuguese theme !!! The restaurant is named after Nandie, the son of Fernando Duarte who is one of the founders of the chain, who is originally Portuguese!!!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nando%27s"}
{"text":"Good food. Please improve your service.  I called and placed an order but when i went to pick up i was told no order in the system. Their food is good in qulaity, taste and qauntity."}
{"text":"Dear Nando's head office.....I've been to many of your restaurants including one in Malaysia and this location...well...is just not good.  Customer satisfaction is lacking, chicken is usually over cooked and dry and whenever extra basting sauce is asked for, very little is applied.  What really suggests to me that this particular location is failing is that around lunch or dinner hours the restaurant is fairly empty whereas other locations are fairly busy any time of the day.  I believe the reason to their failure is that the owners are always there and they try to 'skimp' and save every penny they can.  Now, I like my chicken with a lot of basting sauce and when little is given, I get upset because I like my chicken saucy and every other location I've been to always deliver with the extra sauce.  It's too bad because I'll never be back to this location."}
{"text":"Food is good..chicken is awesome.  But I find that the portions are very small for the price.  For example a large sharable salad is $10 but the portion is ridiculously very small.  Too expensive and definitely will not go again."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Nando's. I love their chicken specially the one with lemon and herb seasoning. Pair it with peri peri fries/potato wedges and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Tried the quarter chicken (breast + wing) with the peri-peri fries. I agree with everyone mentioning that the portions are smaller (especially the garlic mashed potatoes) but everything tasted great and I left satisfied. My friend had the spiced rice which she wouldn't recommend.   I like how you pay first and then they deliver the food at your table. Don't forget to grab the sauce bottles that are at the front.   They really need to put napkins at each table. You can't eat chicken effectively using a knife and fork."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Greeted by a rude gentleman who ruined my whole experience. Walked out right away with his poor attitude."}
{"text":"I came to Nandos to eat with my family and a nice lovely girl came greeted me at the door, she also explained the menu to us.  After deciding what we wanted to eat, believe it or not she was our cashier her name was Nadine. She was very helpful. We receive our food and again nadine was our server with a big nice smile on her face . What's great food without a smile? After finishing our food I came to say goodbye to her and thank her for her great customer service."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time. We enjoy the food but it is over priced. We keep ordering though because the food tastes great. Service is fine also. They are very busy so they do their best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great customer service, great side dishes. What keeps us coming back is the chicken with the peri peri sauce. We are very happy with the service we have received here."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too picky. Maybe my heat tolerance is too high, but after hearing rave reviews about Nando's, I caved in to the hype to see what it was all about.   The service element was interesting, cafeteria style place your order at the counter, get your sauces grab a seat, and someone will bring your food.  Opted for the peri-peri chicken sandwich and the peri-peri fries. Was told the extra hot sauce was extremely, so I grabbed some, as well as hot. I was eating the extra hot off a spoon at the table, and honestly it was not.   My sandwich arrived at the table, and sorry, I was disappointed. The tiniest piece of chicken on an oversized bun. Yes it was pretty tasty chicken but it was microscopic. The fries were pretty good as well, but once again a pretty small serving of them.   Will I return, sure. To try the half chicken perhaps, or some type of chicken dinner, as it was tasty stuff. If I do and the portion is decent, perhaps I'll up my rating, but for now, I left still hungry, which is not what you should be walking out of a restaurant feeling.  Bonus factor, on the refillable soda machine, they have Mr. Pibb, coca cola's Dr Pepper equivalent. A not too common find in Canada.   Until the next time Nando's"}
{"text":"Had been here before and food was pretty good. This time, the food was still decent but the service was atrocious.   I guess I should have started wondering when the server wouldn't entertain the idea of giving us a small sliver of lemon in our water (unless we bought Perrier). The place is not exactly fine dining but given the average cost of an entree, it's not exactly McD or BK either !   The food arrived and one portion was significantly smaller than the other both in terms of meat and sides. We drew this to the attention of the server and got a blank stare. The manager came over and proceeded to tell us to sprinkle the peri peri flakes on it.... Not sure if these were magic flakes that turn into food when leaving the shaker but he seemed to think this would solve our issue.   When we pressed the issue, I didn't know where to look when he said \"you don't need the extra carbs anyway\". I think he meant it as a joke, or at least I hope he did, but given that I am quite stocky, I was quite offended. He is probably correct, I don't need the carbs, but it's not his place to say that - completely inappropriate. Because you have to pay first, we couldn't just walk out so we packed up our food after eating some of it and left. Will not be back to this location again."}
{"text":"awesome! no more swiss chalet for me!  I fell in love with the SUPER BUTTER dipped garlic bread and amazing wedge's that taste light and not oily.  I hate fries and never eat them but these I do!  The lemon chicken was awesome too!  I went 3 times this last week.  Need a break tho now."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!!   Had to wait 50 mins for the chicken to arrive, never got my garlic bread. Cancelled it after waiting another 10 minutes after finishing my chicken. Didn't even get any apologies from the staff. The most rudest waitress and cashier I have come across, they kept giving us rude looks. Didn't serve us properly, we had to get our own plates and were given the glass for drinks only after repeated requests.    Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Gave 1 star bcz it wouldn't let me post the review"}
{"text":"Dry and overcooked chicken that we waited 20 minutes for!  Server just shrugged when we asked what was taking so long. When we complained about the chicken quality, we were told that's the way it always is. Who says sometime like that?? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Well flavored I love the spicy peri peri sauce (personal preference). The chicken is tasty and always well cooked. Two things holding this place from a 5 star would be the service and the price. On numerous times I've called to make orders and It would be placed on hold or not in service. It is very difficult to call in an order here. The prices are a bit on the higher side especially if you get a combo. Otherwise, great venue and would definitely recommend if you are in search of good tasting chicken."}
{"text":"The food here is ok nothing really crazy. What makes it is the sauce. Just remember if u have leftovers the older Indian lady is super CHEAP with sauces!!! Half a chicken with two sauce packets isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Nando's is one of my favorite restaurants.  However, this particular experience wasn't fulfilling.  There was limited seating and they were stingy with the fries.  Would I return?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Been to this branch in Mahogany. The decors are nice but they really scrunch up the people there, no room to move and you can literally hear other people's conversation from the other table. The quality of food does not live up to the quality from the ones I've had before. Their bread is hard and so thin and they still managed to serve that to us. Chicken is dry. I would go to the Nando's up north."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating there the service was fast the whole Chicken was perfectly cocked we have full chicken with tow side fries and salad . The place was so crowded although it wasn't Saturday night ."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the vegetarian options when I visited. Was quite skeptical before but I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered Portobello Mushroom with Halloumi Cheese and Chilli Jam with extra hot sauce on it and I absolutely loved it. The flavors were great and as a vegetarian meal in a popular chain I have to say that they did a commendable job on it. Usually the veg options are sidelined and placed on the menu just so that there is an option available. But here they made sure that the food experience was memorable as well. The peri peri fries were great and the variety of sauces available complimented them perfectly. The service was also perfect!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken at a great price. One of the things I like most about it is that the chicken is juicy, never dry, and has a wonderful spicy flavour. You can adjust the heat if you like to go anywhere from plain to very hot. First time I went to Nando's I was in Washington D.C. visiting and I've been hooked ever since! Delicious sides available as well, fries, mashed potatoes, veggies also."}
{"text":"I went at prime time on a Friday and enjoyed it. The staff are friendly and the food is great. The downside of it was that the dinning area was not cleaned immediately after a table was free. Even though there was people waiting to sit."}
{"text":"Ate there this week and had the Peri-Peri chicken which was great. I would give 4 stars for taste but I left still hungry as the portions are small."}
{"text":"Omg this chicken is the juiciest tastiest I've had in a while . I ordered the leg 1/4 and it was so good. With peri peri fries and rice . Garlic bread was ok. Has a soda fountain pop machine   Only thing I don't like is the self serve for everything which is so annoying having to get up all the time when u forget something . Like what r waiters for ? And then they give u the tip option when you pay.  do we tip at mcdonalds ??Cos that's the same set up here but nicer.  Why am I being asked to tip and also keep having to get up to get my stuff.   Food is delicious tho n great patio !!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I purchased a Groupon voucher months ago and was able to use it here, however the cashier had no idea about it so the manager was consulted. The manager seemed reluctant but processed the voucher anyway with attitude. Seemed to me he wasn't too happy with accepting a voucher...why offer it then?    Food itself, was mediocre. I've had better chicken at the Woodbridge location and the Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Long dam waits  Great food but I dont understand how no one wears hair net . The girls touch there hair and then handle the food YUK!!!"}
{"text":"I would say for the price this place isnt too bad. My only complaint is they dont have any sweet sauces for their chicken. Be prepared to stand and wait to sit because it is usually very busy.  On the othethand its great to take out"}
{"text":"If you are hungry and need to make a \"quick\" stop to fill up, then Nando's is a great choice. I have visited the North Queen location on a week day, so it wasn't that busy.  This was not the case during my visit to the Queen Street location. It was very busy! With only three staff working and approximately 30-40 customers - including the large lunch party. Staff were able to keep it under control and bring out the food as fast as possible. Yes, there was a longer than \"normal\" wait, but ask yourself the question do you want to eat raw meat.   \" Find the enjoyment in your dining experience\""}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Nando's and I was let down. I had high expectations going in, expecting delicious chicken, because, hey; that's what Nando's should be known for. Except, I was left with a $12 quarter chicken meal with the tiniest looking piece of chicken ever. It was not even cooked properly, nor edible. The fries were frozen, deep fried, and then given wayyy too much of their salty seasoning, making it gross.   The ordering process is stupid, because you sit yourself down, then go back up to the cash and order your food, then wait for your food to arrive. In the mean-time you can get drinks, sauces, and cutlery at the self-serve station.  Overall, I would not return to Nando's. it is mediocre food, that is mass-produced, and not very tasty. I prefer Swiss Chalet as crazy as it sounds."}
{"text":"Good chicken, but portions are tiny here! I've been sooo excited to try Nando's and I finally had the chance. Really disappointed by how small our chicken thigh was. The quality of the meat was quite high and I loved all the sauces, but the portion is very small--next time I would opt to order a larger meal, though it seems like this location has smaller portions than a lot of the other ones. Super bummed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place that served both sandwiches (for me) and non-breaded items (for my husband). We decided to give Nando's a try after seeing plenty of good reviews for this place. Plus, it was supposed to be Portuguese and we were all for trying something non-American and non-Indian.  My husband ordered the quarter chicken breast+wing, while I went for the PERi PERi chicken sandwich. We both chose the heat level as Hot. Since we were both not too hungry, we skipped the sides.  When our dishes came, we were both a little disappointed to see our somewhat empty plates. This is really just psychological. If we had ordered some sides, our plates would look more full. But since we didn't have any sides, it would have been nicer to be served on smaller plates, just so that, psychologically speaking, we wouldn't have felt under-served. Anyways, not a biggie - it didn't really affect our enjoyment of our food.  I loved loved loved the chicken sandwich. That sauce was absolutely delicious and I would have loved to buy some of that sauce from them to use in my home-cooking. My husband also loved his chicken. He found it very juicy and the marinade delicious. The only thing we found lacking is that they didn't have any boneless chicken options other than in the sandwiches. I am sure they will be very popular too since their chicken is certainly the star of the dishes.  Overall, we both loved this place and would certainly return to try more of their options."}
{"text":"I love chicken!  Good atmosphere, seating, lighting, music.  Pricey. I love a chicken burger but every time I get it the patty is so small that its more bread then any thing else. Portions take away from the value.  Over the phone orders are a mess."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong if you want classic Portuguese style chicken. I always get the whole or half chicken with a side of French fries. I add my peri-peri sauce for extra heat.  My only problem is the how the service works; when you sit at your table you read over the menu and then walk to the front to place your order and pay.  You help yourself to your drinks, cutlery and condiments.  Con: Prices are a little high Pro:  Portions are decent"}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite spots to get a well prepared meal but unfortunately the food preparation quality has been falling drastically over a span of just 3 months. My last visit I ordered a side of wings which were obviously not properly cooked, I then brought it to the attention of the manager who told me it's just a little red :/ . So yeah, that's that."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food! Canada's Nando's experience is better than in Australia where they are everywhere! Well done to the team who bought this to Canada."}
{"text":"I only had take out from Nando's and I have to say that the food was a new taste sensation for me.  I had the spicy chicken with baked sweet potatoes, rice and salad.  Well done Nando's.  I'm definitely going to have you again."}
{"text":"The place had a friendly atmosphere as well as the service was well done and accommodating to our needs despite the busy hours. The food was great overall, tasty and had a nice heat to it and I highly recommend the garlic bread. There are a lot of choices to choose from drinks like beer and cappuccino to desserts like cakes. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Went to Nando's for the first time as a chaperone for a first date. Decided to have chicken skewers with the garlic mashed potatoes. Skewers were a tad dry but still appetizing. The mashed potatoes, however, were amazing! I would definitely come back and have the mashed potatoes. Manager was super nice, gave us a cheesecake on the house (possibly because he was observing the awkwardness of the first date) and it was good but not AMAZING!  All in all, a nice place to go if just looking to have a nice meal that isn't a burger. I'll be back.   P. S. The waitresses weren't terrible but they also were not on their A game."}
{"text":"It is a hit and miss. The first time I went there, the service was great along with the food.  The second time I went there, they ran out of white meat. My family and I had ordered a full chicken, and to \"make up\" for their lack of white meat, they only added 2 pieces of legs. To me, 4 pieces of legs do not add up to whole chicken. White meat is also more expensive, either we should have gotten more legs or at least a discount! The 3rd time I went there, our food was sitting on the counter for approximately 20-30mins, and when we finally received our food, everything was cold and had to be sent back.  The last time I went there, we had ordered 8 of the Portuguese custard tarts to go, and when I opened the box at home, only 6 were in the box - they're very delicious but they're not cheap!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken Friendly staff (not sure if sarcastic)  Nice hot sauce Mash potatoes are yes. I bought the second spiciest hot sauce and it's not that spicy. Imagine sriracha but spicier."}
{"text":"Decent chicken, rice  and potatoes. and overall a nice place. Weird ordering procedures but i think thats how they do it in Africa. Careful with the hot sauce lol"}
{"text":"I have worked for Nandos in the UK and this does come close when grilling the chicken. Although I love their sauces and peri fries are to die for... but they usually over cook/ burn  the chicken. Lot of other places have opened up with the same concept and cook the chicken better.  The location is great but the store size is too small and it does get busy and seating is very limited.   The servers are very nice and friendly and do their best to accommodate."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for a late lunch on Sunday about 3:00 pm. We arrived via the parking lot and it appeared to be the front but it was the back entrance so the set up is slightly awkward.. We were spotted by the (what seemed to be) manager who then welcomed and attended to us. There was a bit of a delay so he took the time to offer us menus and give us a little tour showing us the sauces and making recommendations. We were impressed with his effort to do his best to ensure a positive first time experience. The decor was bright, new, and interesting. The background music was festive but not intrusive. The menu offered many temptations and the prices were reasonable.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich with seasoned fries. I ordered the 1/4 chicken breast with a side of seasoned rice. We both enjoyed our food. My chicken breast was a bit dry but the extra sauce helped. The sauces are delicious and a must-try. They vary in heat so there is something for everyone. My rice was fine, but I would not be excited about ordering it again. I tasted the fries and they were particularly tasty. My friends commented  that yes, his medium spiced sandwich was spicy, but he seem to enjoy it and ate all of it. We agreed that we would try Nandos again. I would probably not again go at the busiest time since they seem to be still kind of getting their bearings with new staff and such. This location just opened recently (April 8th, 2017)."}
{"text":"This is based on chicken wraps that I ordered soooo it may or may not be a great review since they're known for their rotisserie chicken.   I felt like having something quick and easy to eat so chicken wraps were the way to go! And they were just OK. It's something that anyone could throw together in minutes with leftover chicken and whatever ingredients they had left in the fridge. And portions were a little small for I paid, that part I wasn't so impressed with. At that point I had wished I just ordered a full chicken or something, probably wouldn't been a better bang for my buck!  My husband and I ordered two types of wraps (we shared a half each). He got the peri peri chicken ceasar wrap with a Nando size fries. I got the regular peri peri chicken wrap with a side of coleslaw (the difference: mine had tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and their Nando sauce I guess). Our bill came up to $28.82...pretty pricey if you ask me! Their \"Nando\" size of anything is supposed to be larger than large and the amount of fries we got definitely didn't reflect that! They served it on a big plate but didn't fill it up.   They also had some sauces that you could try! Garlic, medium peri peri, hot peri peri and extra hot peri peri. They all had really good flavours! But I found that the garlic and medium peri peri were spicier than the hot and extra hot.   I'll definitely wanna come back but I would try their rotisserie chicken next time!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for takeout. I got the double leg meal with two sides. The chicken leg was fall off the bone / chargrilled yummy. I'm not a big fan of the piri piri sauce( too sour?) but they have a classic and cream sauce available which is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Went for the first time tonight but it definitely won't be the last. Took the family and we all loved it. Chicken was grilled and seasoned to perfection and the peri peri sauce was a fan fav. Will be recommending this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"First time ever going to a Nandos. The restaurant is nicely laid out. It's similar to a fast food chain but more upscale. We ordered our food at the counter and it was brought to our table. We had to get our own sauces and ketchup at the side for our table... The chicken was super spicy (we got mild) the portions were small. We enjoyed Swiss chalet more as its bigger portion and cheaper too lol. It was very flavorful tho!  As we left the restaurant it was quite packed with nearly every table filled, so I guess this place is quite popular."}
{"text":"Peri-Peri chicken is some of the most delicious chicken there is. Flame grilled, tender, juicy with just the right kick. mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  We actually discovered this place because my boyfriend, who lived in South Africa briefly, raved about Nandos. We were pleasantly surprised to find the chain existed in Canada too. (Peri-Peri, a chili pepper, is said to originate from Mozambique but it's the Portuguese community that picked it up and made it delicious).   This location seems to be run by a family (husband/wife/daughter combo) and they are as sweet and smiley as can be.  The way Nandos works is you order at the counter and then they bring you your food and drink to eat at the tables when it's ready. It's not a classy joint (it is clean though) and it's perfect for an easy lunch or dinner. They do a lot of take out too.  My favourite side is the spicy rice though those spicy fries are pretty delicious too.   If you've never tried Nandos spicy chicken, you should. This stuff is seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Nandos has to be one of my favourite places to go and eat. When I moved to the USA, it was sad to see the nearest one is like a 5 hour drive but that was still amazing and worth the drive. This particular location Is a great disappointment to the Nandos franchise. Service is completely unlike the standard Nandos. They do not give you a table first and there are no bottomless drinks (only bottles). They do have the regular spice levels, which I ordered medium and yet my pitta peri peri was not spicy!? And wait till you get this, I had been given my food after 15mins of ordering but my husbands still didn't come till after I finished my plate (same order). We asked for a glass with ice, the girl never came back. I had to ask for an update of my husbands food which took another 20minutes. Very poor service and definately not one to come to if you love nandos. I have been to nandos in London, Washington and Virginia... This was pants and nandos should get it up to speed and quality"}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices for what you get.  I paid $7.75 for their pita. What you get is a small sized pita (like 5\") with 1 slice of chicken and a handful of lettuce.  My friend ordered the Case salad for $8.75 and got maybe a satay skewer amount of chicken and literally about a handful of lettuce.  Food was decent, but for the same price I can get an entire chicken wrap meal across the road at Swiss Chalet and frankly it tastes just as good.  Avoid wasting your money."}
{"text":"Where'd all the flavour go? What happened to the portions?! If I wanted a kids meal, I would rather a Happy Meal. Nando's seriously needs to step up their game.  Don't get me wrong, Nando's used to be good. Once upon a time. Now it just seems like a fairy tale. 2*s mainly for cleanliness and service. No brownie points for the food.   I remember when I used to crave this place; every time we'd order as a group at the office, I'd be so excited for lunch!   Now the food just comes dry, cold, and tasteless.  The bottles sauces you can bring to your table are still great, but the food shouldn't be good only when you douse it in Peri-peri sauce.   Sorry Nando's, but my tastebuds are hurting. They'll be elsewhere for a while."}
{"text":"I visited Nandos today for the first time with my family after we heard high praises for the food. We ordered the Familia platter which comes with a whole chicken (we chose mild), 2 skewers, a few garlic breads and 2 sides. The portions were smaller than we expected. The chicken was dry which was disappointing considering that should be their specialty.  We originally wanted the spiced rice as a side but they were out of rice. Instead we got peri-peri fries and coleslaw.. very mediocre. We waited almost 45 minutes to be seated and weren't offered an apology whatsoever for the wait. A little customer service goes a long way.  Anyways besides all that, I like that they have a cupboard on the side which has a selection of hot sauces, cutlery, straws and napkins which customers can help themselves to.  Nandos ordering system is set up like Paneras. You order at the counter first and then sit in the dining area. Your food will be brought to you when ready."}
{"text":"Great chicken, nice and juicy, full of flavour, very reasonable price. Much better than Swiss Chalet"}
{"text":"Second time here.I was here opening day and greeted by Maria who is the manager seated and she explained the  concept to me. You pay at cash then they bring your food to table. Chicken is amazing moist and tasty with Lemon and Herb seasoning  that  I chose. Service is great ."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened- my parents come here every once in a while and it's never been so bad before.   Got a whole chicken for takeout, opened it at home and the chicken is charred to a crisp. How can you even pack this up and serve it anyone? Super convenient for the restaurant that it was a to-go order too."}
{"text":"First time here, and a decent experience. Probably will want to come and try it again to see if quality is consistent...  Chicken is grilled nicely, with just enough seasoning and a bit of that grilled taste, not too salty or dry. Potato wedges were tasty and the coleslaw was fresh, crunchy and sweet. Service was good, and the waitress they have working there is very efficient and hardworking. We got the variety pack combo ($30+tax) and it was quite filling for two people. It's a bit on the pricey side though. We tipped since we dined in."}
{"text":"I love the seasoning and their special peri peri fries. When I'm meeting a friend for lunch and we both want to be healthy but have a good meal, we go to Nando's. It's great chicken!! Although the chicken is really good, I feel their portions are small for the price that you're paying."}
{"text":"I ordered food from this place for delivery ! The delivery took a while which I didn't mind but the food was very cold by the time it reached me and I ordered chicken wings which the person at the desk called me and replaced it with potato chips of some kind which was soggy as hell!!  The chicken was pretty good with peri  peri sauce the fries were okay!  I asked for some extra sauce which was not provided with!  Never gonna order from this place again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one time and you can order from the counter. If you are new, they will seat you first before and ask you to take a look at the menu before going back up to the counter to order.  I ordered the Peri-Peri chicken caesar wrap (lemon & herb) with 2 regular sides (peri-peri fries and a caesar salad). Honestly, the wrap was a disaster in my opinion. One half of the wrap was soaking in grease and I thought it was unappetizing. The highlight of the meal was definitely the peri-peri fries. It had a great seasoning.   Overall, I probably won't come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service from staff, lady taking our order was really patient and made recommendations. Server also checked on us. Didn't taste the chili jam but sandwich was really flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been to basically all the Nando's they have in Toronto (downtown, Markham, uptown, and now Scarborough) so I can definitely say I'm a fan of the food. This new location is quite nice, the service is great, the food comes out fast and it's just a pretty place. I got the peri peri chicken sandwich with the garlic mashed potatoes which is my go-to! Though I noticed the sizing of the sandwich to be smaller than what I've gotten at other locations. The chippers are also really great and definitely worth a try. I got the hummus and pita as a start and it tasted like Sabra hummus from the grocery store, which is why this spot gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me. Tho, the good thing about Nando's is you can just add some garlic peri peri sauce, some extra hot peri peri sauce and it tastes amazing (which is exactly what I did and I recommend)!"}
{"text":"We are a frequent customer at Nando's, but this is out first time at this franchise.  Service: horrible. The staff is the saddest and the unhappiest bunch in the world it seems. Their jaws pain to give a simple smile. They have a frown and treat as if they are doing a favor to the customers.  Food- the usual. Love the hot peri peri sauce on chicken. They don't have the sauce in easy reach of patrons, so remember to ask for it from the counter.  Summary- I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"Nando's is a great place to bring the family for Portuguese inspired chicken! ! Anything from no spice to knock your socks off spicy is available.  The vegetable side is also very good."}
{"text":"Food is definately delicious but way too overpriced.  Service is terrible.  Make sure you are ready for a good fight if you want to use a voucher or coupon.  Rather than appreciating your business and treating you like a customer, they make you feel like they are doing you a favour.  Take your hard earned dollars to a place that will appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Great food. This location was also better than other Nando's locations I've been to. We ordered take-out chicken (medium spice), potato wedges and grilled vegetables with Portuguese buns. The meat was tender, the grilled vegetables had a lot of flavour and the wedges/buns were good too. The food was also packaged nicely which is always a plus. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I may be a bit bias because I grew up eating Nando's as a kid, sooo... but the chicken was great (the rice not so much) and the servers were so friendly"}
{"text":"Don't ever go here. No one has a clue as to what they are doing. No one at the main counter for 10 minutes. The girl didn't know how to operate the machine. We ordered fries and Portuguese bread while we waited for some friends to turn up...,. And when our friends arrived a half hour later l, still no sign of the fries or the bread. Asked for the manager to discover that she was the overworked lady trying to cook a load of chicken. She apologized and all she had to offer was that all customers have had to wait. We still chose not to give up and went back to order the main meal when we were told that chicken would take an hour!!!!!!! They were extremely kind to give me a refund for the fries and bread that never arrived.  I wonder how you are still in business. Possibly the only reason is that we Canadians are an extremely patient lot.  Good luck to all who still choose to go there. Don't tell me that I didn't warn you"}
{"text":"There was a hair in the food, when I went to show the server he took it out but only offer to replace the wedges. Once I complained about the hair touching the chicken he seemed annoyed at the fact that I was still not happy. Probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"There best part which i liked and have ever tried is there chicken Gud and fast service and even enough good to attract customers"}
{"text":"I think that if the word gets out about Nando's for Swiss Pigeon fans, Swiss is screwed.  Very flavorful chicken and sides -- the mashed potatoes and veggies were awesome.  As Adam notes, the structure is screwy.  It has a total identity crisis.  Seems like slightly more than a cafeteria in the sense that you order at a cashier.  If you think I'm tipping before service you're off your trolley!  The only service is delivery of your food to the table, and that's it.  Not worth my usual 20%.  Be a service restaurant, or a cafeteria."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me I just ate the spicy chicken with their Portuguese sauce AMAZING, the place is fantastic and clean while the service is fast? Thumbs UP!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The chicken is really good with a variety of different sauces. The grill the chicken over an open flame and it's so tender and juicy. Tried the kabobs, wraps and half chicken (not all at once though). You can pick a side - fries, salad, potato and beans. The Mediterranean salad is really good. Friendly staff. Prices are somewhat above average but worth it in my opinion. Really good for a chain..."}
{"text":"I've heard about Nando's from Yelp friends for some time.  Today my husband was craving grilled chicken.  Yes.. I mean grilled chicken, not deep fried chicken.  We wanted to eat a bit healthier lol.  He suggested me to go to a new place that just opened on Queen St. West not long ago.  At first, I didn't know that it was Nando's until he showed me the name of the restaurant on Yelp. It was a Fate lol   FOOD (4 stars) We ordered \"the VARIETY combo\" which was supposed to come with  1/2 chicken, five whole wings, two skewers and two sides.  Sadly, they ran out of the skewers.  They offered us five wings instead of 2 skewers.  We were ok with it (no choice lol).   Thank goodness!  The wings were so good~~~~ Yes I always say so well when I love something.  I fell in love with the PERIPERI WINGS. We finished them all!  No need to pack anything home.  The two sides we got were SMASHED POTATOES and COLESLAW.  We like them too.  Only one thing we brought home was a bottle of EXTRA HOT SAUCE!  I purchased it for $5.99.  I love hot sauce!   You can also choose the level of spiciness for your chicken.  We chose only medium because we weren't sure how spicy they would be.  It turned out that they were not spicy for the medium hot.  However, it was perfect when we dipped it with extra hot sauce.  Yummy!   SERVICE (3.5 stars) They don't take your order at a table.  You can order and pay at the counter; then they will bring your food to your table.  They will seat you at a table then put a peri-peri sign (chicken sign stick) on your table and explained how to order.  Then, you can go to order at the counter whenever you're ready. It was a bit difference experience for me though.     You can also give them a tip if you want.  If you give them at the counter, it would be sharing tip.  The staff was nice, funny, friendly and cute.   They also have take-out and delivery.  If you feel want to stay home, just one click call DOORDASH!  We're thinking to use its service sometime soon.   AMBIANCE (3.5 stars) It was big space.  They have a big dining room and patio. It's definitely good for big parties.     PRICE (3.5 stars)   OVERALL (4 stars) Great place for chicken lovers. PERI PERI Chicken wings were amazing.  Don't forget to dip it with EXTRA HOT SAUCE!"}
{"text":"Pricey but better than Swiss chalet or Kelsey. I've been here many times with friends and the group combos are more than enough food to share with guys. The peri peri sauce is one of the best sauces ever. For takeout though, the portions are small."}
{"text":"Ok, so it is new and there are teething problems. I get it and so I have visited now 3 times to get my beloved Nando's and the chicken livers. There is always something painstakingly wrong! C'mon, guys!! Get up to Nando's standards!   Today, the front of house lady was super lethargic and I asked her to please clean the table before seating us. She saw there were marks everywhere but turned a blind eye. She looked very sick and tired.   The chicken livers, which I have ordered all 3 visits, because they are delicious, seem to be decreasing in quantity and today's portion was shockingly so small! I left hungry. Coleslaw is amazing, but I needed more chicken livers in that mostly empty bowl. This is a shock because Nando's is always so filling. Nope.   Last week Tuesday their fryer was 'broken' so nobody got any potato fries for the lunch service. At some point they started serving potato fries again but neglected to ask or apologize for the inconvenience to all of the tables that had to go without. Common courtesy would have the manager asking if he can give fries on the house and present a small plate for fun and politeness. Nope. My friends refused to go back there this week.   I do like that the cashiers are getting better trained. They now warn us of time delays with the chicken livers and it is definitely acceptable. Chicken can be done more well done or medium if you don't like charring. Good to know. The middle cashier lady is still super surly, like we owe her a favour and she needs to get a smile on her face and greet a little warmly, please. Or find a less human contact establishment.   Lots of kids trying to be waiters and cooks. I would have liked to see the manager more active and leading by example. The front of house hostess needs to go as she is tired!   I will go back one last  time next week to my beloved Nando's brand, and then my patience is all out, and I will go back to supporting the Burlington location rather. Long drive to Burlington but none of the amateurishness."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a friend and ordered the half a chicken with two sides w/c is rice and wedges. Their famous periperi chicken is very tasty and the service is really good also tried the pita dipped in tomato sauce is very good to start the course. Was very happy to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place, mainly cause there's only 1 Nando's I know of in Mississauga. Their chicken use to be more spicy (when asked for \"We dare you\") but now it's not that hot, at least not for me. Great service and is always clean.   Peri Peri is very very delicious."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times and sometimes they would be very busy. I'd suggest that you order food to go but even that may take a while when there are a lot of people.  However food wise, it tastes great especially their chicken with there peri peri sauce and their garlic bread. Their other sides like rice, coleslaw, and salads are what they are.  Only problem that I have with the food though is the portions compared to the price, it's just expensive and doesn't really fill me up.  However I just went for a birthday here at a slower time and we spent $137 for 8 people getting the share platters of Party pack (feeds 5-6) and Full Pack (feeds 3-4). Getting 3 whole chickens, 8 garlic breads (which are pretty big), 5 sides: salad, potato wedges, rice, mashed potatoes and coleslaw and a pitcher of coke (with 1 limited refill). All of that was actually really filling personally for me.  Overall I find it expensive for ordering for yourself since portions are small in my opinion and doesn't fill me up but coming in with a big group satisfied me with their share platters options"}
{"text":"Good food! I like eating at Nando's - I see it as a more premium Swiss Chalet - and with better tasting food too. The concept is different from other restaurants - you walk in and pick if you're dining it or taking out - if you dine in, they show you to your seats, but then you gotta go back to the front to order. This is pretty inefficient, and can be pretty frustrating during busy times because you essentially lose your spot in line when you first walk in, and if a large order comes in after you for take out, they will most likely get served before you.  I tend to get the Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich when I go here, with 2 sides. The garlic mashed potatoes were not buttery enough for me - I found them try. The peri peri fries are good. And the peri peri chips were too salty for me. The sandwich though is delicious. It's healthy, you can pick your sauce, and they also have bottles of sauces at the front if you wanted to add more to it.  Overall, I like Nando's and will be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"I finally went to try out Nandos as everyone I know always tell me great things about it. I'll be focusing on 3 things, the service, pricing and food itself.   I walked in and I had to wait a while to be greeted, when there was barely anyone dining inside. The woman at the front did not look welcoming or happy at all, she asked if this was my first time, which is was, and rolled her eyes as she had to explain how the dining experience worked. I was told to pick a table to sit at. I looked around yet almost all the tables still had plates of empty chicken and food, there were barely any tables cleaned! I finally found some on the other side but the tables were still quite dirty and sticky. The front woman didn't explain to me that I had to grab my sauce or cutlery, so I was sitting at my table for a while, very confused. Overall, the service wasn't the greatest, but it could've been worse. I'd rate this 1/5.  The pricing on the food is pretty average. I'd say its a little high as the portions are quite small, especially the chicken. At first I wanted to purchase 2 half chicken meals but I figured to share since it seemed like it was alot. But when I finished my share, I was still left so hungry, almost like what I ate didn't make a dent in my stomach at all. The pricing is not bad, but I don't think it's worth the food here. I'd rate this 1/5.  Now the food. There isn't anything really special about this. It just tastes like BBQ charred chicken. I've had way better than this one. The sauces are just alright. There isn't much flavor as well. Just smokiness from the char but tasted burnt the more I ate it. I tried the garlic and spicy sauce and it was ok. I got the spiced rice and nando fries, and they were meh. The rice wasn't that good, the fries were decent though. I'd rate this 3/5.  Overall, I don't see the big hype of Nandos, I've had better Portuguese chicken from other places. I guess it's okay for a fix but if you're craving really good grilled chicken, I wouldn't recommend here."}
{"text":"I been going to this place for a very long time, I'm very familiar with the staff and owner. I usually order a classic, I spend 30/40 every visit few times a week. my last 5-6 visits always have resulted in expired or microwaved rice... there is no issues with the fries or chicken.. the rice is always hardened thus the rice is stored for days and microwaved. Today, it felt like I was eating rocks with chicken. I complained to the store owner and he brought me a brand new batch of rice which WAS EVEN WORSE the one before. No wonder my nephews were complianing about stomach aches, those hard rock rice are just a way to save money on the cost of customer satisfaction and health. I spent hundreds of dollars here through the course of the years, I complained to the waitress about the second batch and demanded the owner again and HE LEFT AND Ignored on purpose."}
{"text":"Nando's is a takeout counter, and after you pay, if you're eating in they give you a number on a stand and bring your food out to you. The prices could be just a smidge lower, but they aren't bad. This is, after all, several notches above regular fast food, and good for takeout, too.  Also, if you like heat and spice, then this is the place for you. If you can't handle the heat, you can get a lemon pepper flavour, but I've never tried it.  The staff here are a bit disengaged sometimes. Not really unpleasant, but not especially warm, either. Which is ok, since I come to Nando's for the food and not so much the service. The best part of Nando's is the delicious chicken and the even more delicious sauces. (Oh, garlic peri-peri, oh hot peri-peri! Soooo goooood!).   Oh. Where was I? I was distracted by sauces. Did I tell you about the sauces? ;)   Go to Nando's. Enjoy everything. Leave on an endorphin high from the heat. Feel happy. :)"}
{"text":"Had to finally leave a review, since we've become more or less regulars at this location. This Nando's is hands-down the best location I've experienced. We only tried it for the first time last summer, and have come for a meal a few times a month since then. The food is consistently delicious and fresh, and super fast as well. Having been to a couple other Nando's recently, the efficiency here is definitely superior. The value of what you get for the cost is outstanding; if we had a family to feed we would definitely bring them out to Nando's. The decor and music is great for a fast-casual restaurant, and makes it feel like you're out to dinner even when you're not paying Toronto restaurant prices for full service. That being said, the staff here is always friendly, and I have to compliment the manager in particular, as he is always working hard supporting his team and ensuring each guest is enjoying his or her meal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It doesnt matter how special their Peri Peri sauce is or how they serve \"fast casual\" in S Africa. This is a middle class suburb beside a Wal-Mart. They seated us, then told us its not a full service restaurant. We go to the cashier to order who then interrupts my order by picking up the phone and asks me three times to repeat my order.  There was no silverware knives out, though we were told to get our own cutlery and my food was brought out 15 mins before my friends wrap was brought to the table. Terrible setup, terrible service.  Next..."}
{"text":"If you've ever been before to a Portuguese chicken restaurant/take-out, then you know what we're talking about. just think of Nando's as the same, but the place is way nicer, on a trendy but relaxed atmosphere (this also comes with a price) Food is great, although I agree that some of the sides are a bit small, but the flavors are pretty good, and the Peri-Peri sauces you can try are excellent... if you've never had this kind of chicken before, I would suggest to order your food low on spicy sauce, and you can always put more hot sauce as you discover what your optimal level is. As some others put said it before, you sit down, choose what you want to eat, then go and pay for it, then your food will be brought to your table. Don't let this put you off, because that is the traditional way these type of restaurants work, and come and try if for yourself."}
{"text":"The moist juiciest chicken you will ever eat!   The chicken was so tender and juicy and flavorful.   Highly recommend going here for lunch with your friends.   The restaurant was very casual and you order your food when you walk into the place.   A waitress then delivers It to your table.   We loved the chicken and fries from here.  We ordered a full chicken and 1 side.  With an extra side of rice.   The rice was a-little dry and bland.   But the chicken, fries and garlic bread were delicious."}
{"text":"When my friend and I went inside, we were told there was a 15 minute wait or a table for 2. We decided to do takeout instead but only to wait for two chicken skewers and fries was 25 minutes. In that time we saw so many tables open up and fill. After waiting 25 minutes I went up to ask what was taking so long and was told that our food was ready, just no one bagged it and gave it to us. On the way out I was very vocal in the unsatisfactory way we were served but the servers did not even bat an eye. One checked up on us while we were waiting but walked away without helping??   To top it all off, when we got home to eat I discovered my vegetarian wrap was actually a chicken sandwich!! I didn't eat tonight because of Nando's.  Honestly will never return."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this location 1-2 times a month. We usually order the classic with the side of potato wedges, which is just enough for the two of us. The chicken is DELICIOUS and their flavourful sauce which varies from mild to extra hot is the cherry on top.  The dessert menu is not that great and has only one or two items. You order and pay for the food before you sit down and the food gets delivered to your table within 10 mins."}
{"text":"Me and hubby are a great fan of nandos. We are glad that they serve Halal chicken. Though we are not a big fan of their service. They close early, their last order would be at 9:30 or so. The food is always good. We order the same quarter chicken meal and hubby loves the skewers. Overall its good for their price."}
{"text":"Nando's in South Africa has the BEST commercials in the world; just look on YouTube if you don't believe me.  Now their chicken is alright too: spicy and juicy. I'm just not sure why people think it's \"amazing\"...who can't marinate and roast a bird in their own kitchen?   Slightly overpriced, especially their sides, but all in all a welcome addition to the fast food universe.  One caveat: according to reports out of the UK, they have a way to go before they qualify as treating their birds \"humanely\"."}
{"text":"Nando's is Nando's, right?  I beg to differ. As with any franchise, each location receives the same ingredient shipments and follows the same recipes and yet, it seems to me that the quality of food can still vary from location to location.  This location in particular provided me with a poorer experience than when I ate downtown at the Bay/Grenville location. The service was slower and the chicken was drier - two very important aspects of my dining experience. I mean, as a stand alone restaurant, I'd probably give 3 stars for an \"A-okay\" but when comparing it to another Nando's franchise in the same city, I'm leaning more towards the \"Meh, I've experienced better\"  I doubt I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"It's very good bbq chicken and wings. Staff wasn't that friendly but I was too hungry to care.  Much better chicken than Swiss chalet that's for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really do enjoy Nando's chicken.  Having said that, this place is chaotic at best because they make you get a table first and then go up to order.  During busy times, there is no rhyme or reason to the queue and the people standing around waiting for their takeout are occupying a place in the same line or multiple lines of people waiting to place or pick up takeout orders, dine in orders, and those waiting for a table.  It literally feels like a queue at the airport where everyone stands in the boarding line even though their zone has not yet been called.  This does not make for a pleasant dining experience and in fact makes me want to avoid coming here no matter how much I love Nando's.  They really need to do something about this.  We ordered and paid at 6:58pm - that is the time stamp on our receipt.  Some of our  food arrived at 7:27pm and we had to ask for the missing parts.   Our appetizer was missing and they had to bring it after our mains.  So the food is a 5 and the dining experience is a negative score to arrive at a very generous 1 star rating.  This can be easily fixed under the right management as there is plenty of eager young staff who just need some direction to work effectively."}
{"text":"Yippee!  A Nando's right by Sherway Gardens!  I have been to their location in Mississauga and the chicken there is delish.  It's a bit of an odd setup where they seat you and give you a table number but you then have to go to the cash to order and pay and then they bring your food and drinks over.  We ordered the quarter chicken dinner with choice of one or two sides.  They also have family meals where you can share sides with a whole chicken if you like.  The potato wedges were good as were the veggies.  The chicken is always good.  And that peri peri sauce yum yum  ... I could and did put it on almost everything!  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Love the food but it's disappointing that I ordered a kids meal and they don't offer yogurt for takeout.. although the price is the same for you to sit in and you DO get the yogurt. An alternative item should be provided if it's a matter of packaging."}
{"text":"I went to this new location two days ago. Food was excellent however the service was not too good.  I felt the server was not very attentive and kept interrupting me while i was ordering. The most disappointing thing was when I received the quinoa avocado salad, there was no avocado in it! And nobody told me when I was ordering the salad. I have been to so many restaurants but had never encountered anything like that. That was totally unacceptable.   Afterwards, the server just said you can choose another ingredient in it but he never came back to check with us.   In one word, their patio is really nice and a good place to gather in summer. However, the service really takes off lots of points for the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time trying Nando's and I loved it. If you love hot sauce like I do, you're going to love their peri peri sauce. Warning, the hottest is spicy but not spicy noodle challenge. I'd buy a whole bottle for myself to put it on everything. I got the sharing plate for 2.   It comes with garlic bread, chicken and one side. The chicken was for the most part nice and soft. It does have that Costco chicken feel but it really is the sauce that makes it distinct. For the side, we had the spiced rice which wasn't really that good. I would give Nando's 4 stars if the side was better but there are a variety of sides. We also got the Portuguese tart which was amazing. I've had ones in Macau (which was taken over by Portugal) and it really does bring back that feel. They aren't fresh out of the oven but they still taste very good."}
{"text":"Juicy chicken perfectly seasoned definitely more than enough food for 4 people. Try out the frozen yogurt too as it's all you can eat, it's a nice pallet cleanser!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Nandos! I recommend it to everyone I talk to!  Staff are always so friendly, the food is always consistent with its flavours and it's delicious, and the inside of the restaurant has a fun happy vibe to it. It also has a huge patio out front!  My go to is the chicken with lemon and herb flavouring, garlic mashed potatoes, casa salad, and garlic bread!!! If you want hearty, delicious, filling meal that tastes home cooked with love then eat here. Don't waste your time going to the other restaurants on queen west they are just tourist traps.   Great addition to the neighbourhood, and BONUS the hours are great, so if you need a a protein meal after the gym GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a ton of good things about this place from a lot of people. Why? I, for one was unimpressed and underwhelmed.   To start off the ordering system is quite confusing. My friend and I, decided to check this place out and when we walked in no one greeted us. We didn't know if we had to seat ourselves or wait to be seated - so we just stood there! We finally asked the cashier how the whole ordering system works and she said we would have to seat ourselves, order up to the front and go back to our table.  Umm...what? Also, she didn't mention we had to know our table number, so that was another issue.   The food was bland and overpriced. The only thing I enjoyed was the hummus and their peri peri sauce.  TBH, I think Swiss Chalet's rotisserie/grilled chicken was a lot better than Nando's.   Sorry Nando's, you didn't win me over."}
{"text":"DA BEST...ALWAYS!  I mean seriously, what is there not to like about this place? No matter where we go - Vancouver, DC, London, Toronto...Nando's is always providing great service and damn delicious chicken.  This spot is no different, do yourself a favor and order the full chicken with mashed potatoes and garlic bread for you and a friend. Then smother it in the sauce of your choice.  Can't wait for our next Nando's visit!"}
{"text":"This is a terrible location. Extremely crowded, noisy, poor unenthusiastic service. Orders not dispatched in an orderly way. Boss comes in to yell at female servers and expedites. Tables not cleared fast enough, depressingly low number of tables make the place feel cramped. No wonder I and others decided to take our orders away.  Who would want to sit in this noise? Chicken was serviceable, not especially attractive. Red pepper hummus was not hummus just overpowering chopped peppers. Cole slaw wasn't fresh. Fries were cold and so were the flatbreads. I wish I could have gotten my money back it was so disappointing and nothing at all like the Nando's overseas in Malaysia or Singapore."}
{"text":"Have been to Nando's on North Queen St in Etobicoke, which was great. So great that it may have spoiled me for my experience at the downtown Queen St West location:  The good: - nice servers/staff, always someone around to help - self-serve model = casual vibe - large patio - pretty tasty food - peri peri fries all the way! - no wait/line - we visited on a Tuesday night  The bad: - small portions!!! - Haloumi cheese side was tiny - self-serve model, if you're looking to be able to order and pay at your table.  - overall, experienced a lack of value because of the tiny pieces of chicken we received. Not sure if it was a one-off, but the Etobicoke location beats this one."}
{"text":"This is one of the absolute worst location of Nando's horrible service staff never checks up on tables and has bad attitude. Had to wait 30 minutes for half of my order and another 40 minutes for rest of it.  After I brought it to the owners attention he simply stated he will give us extra food. How about giving us the food we paid for????   2 tables came after us ate their food and left we were still waiting for our food.   Worst of all no one even apologized for this horrific experience.   If you're looking for your money's worth definitely skip this location because no one here values their customers."}
{"text":"Worst Ever!!!  Bad Management   Bad Taste  Worst Service  Don't ever make the mistake"}
{"text":"Nandos is nandos.   It is good decent chicken. Quality and service is what u would expect from a nandos.  Decent and good quality food for the family. This location is new and it Definetly looks that way too.  The peri peri fries are recommended."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, this location always has a huge line up to dine in, no matter the time. Their system is a bit ridiculous, where you have to line up to get seated (and get a table #), only to which you have to line up again to order your actual food.   Nonetheless I give this location 4 stars for the endless amounts of coupons they deliver to my house, and for it's delicious peri peri chicken.  Disclaimer- that corner booth seat is extremely cold due to the air vents, which ends up making your food colder faster. It's worth waiting an extra few minutes to get better seats."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner because it was within walking distance to my hotel. The Peri-Peri chicken was incredible. I also recommend getting the Caesar salad and wild rice. The people here are extremely friendly and offer great service. Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Great place for chicken!  I came here Monday evening with my cousin and we ordered the shared platter (feeds 2-3 ppl) it was a lot of food lol. It came with a whole chicken, plate of garlic bread and you can choose your sides (we chose peri peri fries). Like always, I think we over ordered lol.  Their chicken was delicious and if you ordered medium spicy it gives it a nice kick. The peri peri fries however, I really don't know what the hype is. It tasted like...seasoned fries nothing too special. So next time I'd ordered another side or something.   One thing to note is that you have to order at the front and tell them your table #. That's how your food is brought out to you.   Will go back!"}
{"text":"Going in with almost no expectations as I had never been to any of their restaurants I was so happy that it was really great.   Myself and my daughter went for her birthday dinner last night - she ordered a 1/4 chicken with fries and I got chicken skewers with sides of rice and mashed potato and we also ordered the garlic bread.   At this particular location you order at the front and then they bring you your food once you sit down. It was very packed which is probably typical for a Saturday night but I was really happy though as we were able to get seated fairly quickly.   Our food probably took about 15 minutes which I found very reasonable everything was hot and delicious and you could tell it was freshly made. Her chicken was nice and plump and cooked perfectly as were My skewers.  The service was friendly, the staff attentive.  My daughter loves spicy foods but her 1 drink was not enough and when I asked for water they were prompt and bringing it to us and asking if I wanted one which I did not need as I was pretty much done eating.   Bottom line the food was fantastic the service was excellent and I absolutely would be happy to return to this particular location."}
{"text":"Pros: The chicken is good and juicy and has a consistent flavour throughout.  Location is prime, patio is awesome  Reasonably priced  Cons: Nothing else on the menu is good, at best it's bland  Poor alcoholic drink selection"}
{"text":"After visiting the real Richmond Hill Corporate run Nando's, I was surprised at how bad the service is at Markham Road. I have visited  this location a few times and have always left with a bad experience and never went back!   The staff never smile or try to engage in conversation with you and in comparison to the real Nando's at Richmond Hill- this seems like a fake version. The chicken is not as flavourful and the portions are very small. Save your experience and try Richmond Hill for a real Nando's  experience!"}
{"text":"When you walk in your greeted by a friendly face and asked if you would like to dine in. Clearly Nando's have upgraded themselves since my B.C days.  The decor: I love it Personally. The booths are cute, the light fixtures and just the vibe of the place feels good.  The food: I ordered the medium peri-peri Caesar wrap and the husband ordered quarter chicken meal. Both with unlimited drinks. Yes! Raspberry sprite for the win!   The food is delivered to your table number and it smells and taste delicious. The one downside was my husband's side of veggies never came. However, they were nice enough to let him know and offer him something else. Good service!  Can't wait to visit again! Will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"First time trying Nando's and ordered the whole wheat peri peri chicken wrap which was about the size of a 500mL water bottle. Not a huge veggie guy and this wrap certainly contained a lot of it. However, the veggies were quite fresh and tasty, and the chicken tasted incredible along with the lemon and herb sauce (although there was quite a lot and became a bit soupy by the time i got to the end of the wrap).  Staff was kind and even brought my order out to where i was sitting. This location was also very clean and had a warm ambience."}
{"text":"The food was OK the process was odd. I want service when I go to a restaurant and this was more like a cafeteria process. You sit @table review menu and order @main entrance and carry your beverage back to your table. Not very condusive to sitting down with a friend with a few drinks and nice meal cause everytime you need something you have to order it @ the order desk/counter."}
{"text":"Despite being open for awhile now, it seems like they're still figuring things out and getting into the rhythm of things. We went shortly after they opened on a Tuesday, and being one of the few diners at the restaurant at the time, the cashier/hostess/food runner took the time to explain the concept and how their system works.   We quickly placed our orders and waited awhile for our food to come. The fountain soda machine was also out of Coke so we had to wait for it to be refilled as well. One slice into cutting into our chicken, we realized our chicken still pink in the middle. We brought this to the attention to the cashier/hostess/food runner and they offered to have it redone. Once again, it did take awhile and we noticed that when it was ready, it'd been sitting on the counter window for awhile. At this point, groups starting to come in and the queue started to build up. I would say the the number of staff on the floor couldn't keep up with the demand.   We finally got our food and this time, the chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The additional sauces you get from the condiments stand were great as well, especially the garlic sauce.   While the food tasted great, raw chicken is hard to forgive. The friendly staff were able to overcome their shortcomings, but at this time, I'm a bit hesitant to give them another try."}
{"text":"i have somewhat a little different experience from the rest of Yelpers. i really love the CHICKEN and Potato wedges only. rest of the food is garbage. very dry and hard to swallow.  the waiting staff is extremely rude and not accommodating at all. takes them forever to bring the requested items.  once they screwed up my order and would not take the responsibility and throw back on me."}
{"text":"I ate at Nandos many years ago at a different location.  From memory, it was a good experience.  However, today I decided to try Nandos again at the Markham Rd location. Regrettably the food was not up to par.  The chicken tasted like regular unseasoned chicken cooked on a grill and lathered with hot sauce.  The fries were tasteless.  I didn't enjoy the chicken which were lathered with extra hot sauce but didn't taste like mild sauce, the chicken tasted unseasoned.  If I do have the urge to try piri piri chicken again I will go to The Crave Grill in the West End where the whole experience was a delight and the food tasted great.  I would not venture into another Nandos restaurant again.  Sorry."}
{"text":"We've had Nando's at other locations and weren't blown away by dinner this evening.  The chicken could have been cooked a few minutes longer.  Not undercooked per se, but definitely borderline.  Usually medium hot is perfect for us but this meal was sorely under-sauced and lacked flavour.  Take-away packaging wasn't well thought out.  Plastic container for garlic bread created condensation that spoiled the dish.  A piece of kitchen paper could have been laid in the bottom of the chicken box to help manage condensation there.  Fries were simply piled onto a fast food sleeve and dropped on top of the order which was packed into an open-top paper bag.  Stone cold upon arrival.  Sealing the bag would have gone a long way to insulating the food.  The staff was pleasant but the meal wasn't a good return for the money."}
{"text":"I loved that place for 3 visits! I even wrote a 5 star review that i am now editing. I guess its a hit and miss. Came today on a Friday night got a cold chicken sandwich asked to warm up the meat, got barely warm tiny piece of really dry chicken inside. Tomato inside was rotten I couldn't eat it, and took it out. Terrible. Last 2 times i also had a chicken sandwich so i know how its supposed to look/taste like. Really sad experience. I am going to give it another try maybe but i guess not late evening when food is going bad"}
{"text":"This nandos was a let down. So we ordered 1/4th chicken one medium one hot with coleslaw, and peri peri rice.   Also ordered chicken skewers for my son with garlic mashed potatoes.   Our chicken was excellent, coleslaw not bad, rice excellent as always. You would think what's wrong with me, why did I give them 2 stars. Usually I don't really care about the service.   So when I ordered the meal, I was told that the kids meal comes with a frozen yogurt, but they were out of it. I kept waiting, I thought they would substitute it or give me a discount... Nothing. So I paid and went back to my seat.   My son's skewers were rubber chewy. When I told them they said we can make new ones, I said that's not an option as it would take another 20 minutes and my son can't wait that much here sharing with us.   At this point if I was the staff I would have definitely offered the customer a discount something complimentry a coupon something, but nothing just a plain sorry.   It takes a lot to piss me off when it comes to poor customer service and these guys succeeded."}
{"text":"Nandos never disappoints!!!! We got the chicken sandwiches and were very impressed!   The garlic mashed potatoes were so yummmmmy and the spiced rice was great also! And the fries were a great side!   It was so yummy and the sauces were great! I'm so excited to come back since this place is so close to my house! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Good service at this location. If you've never tried nandos before, you may want to start with the half chicken (on the hot level); its grilled chicken, doused in piri-piri sauce (African birds eye chilli). Get a side of potato wedges, you won't regret it.   A bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"My first time to Nando's.  It was very clean and staff are friendly.  We were taken to our table, reviewed the menu and then I had to put my order in at the cashier.  I ordered 2 quarter chicken with 2 side orders (extra), 2 soft drinks and 2 Natasha (Portuguese tarts).  The total came to $38.99.  I was shocked how little was on my plate. Two tiny quarter chicken with  small bowls of side.  I am too embarrassed to take any pictures.  I could have got a whole chicken at Costco for 1/2 the price.  I have to admit the chicken was flavorable but not worth the price.  I was hungry after the meal.  Maybe I should have gone to Swiss Chalet instead.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"If you love Chicken this is the place. It's the best chicken place in my opinion. It's authentic and reasonable on price point. This location struggled the first few months and I was disappointed with them compared to the other location here in Calgary. Now that they got the ball rolling it's fantastic. You should know it's a different dinning experience. You basically get a seat assigned and than go up to the cashier's and order your meal. They than bring it out. Once you get used to it, it won't feel weired at all and seems to work. The first time can be a bit confusing and I think that's why they struggled a little in the beginning. They are on top now and I'm loving it. Great Job Nando's."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken place in town. The garlic mashed potatoes are amazing. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Nando's is good as always, their bottled sauce is great as always   I always opt for the spicy but the regular is pretty tasty as well   Nothing much more to say here except that this is a ust try if you like grilled Portuguese style chicken, even worth the drive"}
{"text":"We went here in the first week they opened, and we were pleased with the decor and the atmosphere, service was really good, and of course the place was clean.  The portions were small for the price, which is pretty disappointing. Got a quarter chicken meal, and also some chicken sliders. There wasn't much chicken at all in the sliders, but flavor-wise, it was good. No complaints.  Over-all good place to dine-in for the service and atmosphere, but maybe not if you are expecting huge servings for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Have been to this place more than half a dozen times, always got fresh chicken  cooked to perfection. However service can improve a little with attention to customers by checking on them."}
{"text":"One word to describe Nandos Oakville.. triggering.  Incompetent staff doing the least amount of work and chatting amongst themselves. No sense of initiative, and poor management. My first experience there, my chicken was undercooked and  it took at least an hour for everything to come out and an overworked manager who was taking control of the kitchen and orders. Although she was kind enough to give us a full refund. Now it's my second time here as I decided to give them a second chance, same poor service, watched my salad sit on the dispatch table for half an hour, with my chicken that was ready and a full house of staff standing around and moving the kitchens tickets when my food could of been at my table!! We ordered the rice and it was NOT what it was supposed to taste like, the salad was old and disappointing. I've been to many different locations, including the ones in the uk and I was extremely disappointed in the Canadian locations, especially this one. In conclusion, don't come here unless you have extremely low standards and have a lot of time.   How is this location still running?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chicken Caesar salad and there was a small portion of chicken . Not only was the chicken dry it was mostly burnt. There was hardly any dressing. If I could put no stars I would and I will NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Nandos Chicken. My friend has a Groupon deal so we decided to go there for dinner. The restaurant was quite busy when we arrived but it was close to the end of dinner time and when the store was closing so we managed to get a table. You order at the front counter and pay upfront and they will bring the food to you. They have a different combos, sides and spices for you to customize your order. I ordered the Quarter Chicken with Lemon and Herbs sauce with sides a garlic mashed potatoes and potato wedges. The food came out fairly quickly. The chicken was nice, moist and juicy. Loved the potato wedges and the garlic mashed potatoes was alright. Good portions for the price that you are paying. Staff are friendly and polite. The restaurant is generally cleaned. Overall, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5/5 if I could. My friend and I have been coming here every now and then and from a food perspective it has never disappointed. The chicken tastes great. It is grilled to perfection and is always juicy and tender. The peri-peri sauce is addictive. We typically order the peri peri fries/wedges and mash potatoes. Stick with those as you can't go wrong with those. I mix peri peri sauce, ketchup and chili powder together and eat my chicken and fries with that. Try it!   The value is what brings Nandos down though. The portion is small and is somewhat on the expensive side considering what you pay for (close to $12 for a quarter chicken and one side). That being said, if something tastes good I have no problems paying a bit more.   If you're not sharing, pay a bit more and order the 1/4 breast and wing! The 1/4 thigh is so small it's laughable. Also, don't assume you have to buy a bottled beverage, ask for a glass of water!   Personally I don't tip when I eat here. There is hardly any service so why should you? Hmmm."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices and decent food, chicken is flame grilled with different spices to choose from and variety of sides to compliment. I also like their Portuguese egg tarts! I have gone to nandos just to take out the tarts for dessert. It's a comfortable environment for family's to eat in."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here, the staff are super nice! The food is well cooked and the atmosphere is friendly and place is brand new!! My fav eatery so far"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a nandos in over 10 years from a previous problem.  After going I was surprised how flavourful their chicken is with the peri-peri sauce! I will definitely head there again. The only downfall is the resturant got really cold from the door constantly opening (high traffic means good food!!) other than that, great service and food!"}
{"text":"Been there at least 10 times since there opening!   GreAt staff!   Very yummy flame grilled chicken.  Kids friendly    Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Really good chicken and pasteis de nata. Also I liked the walk up ordering system and the cool chairs and ambiance."}
{"text":"Decided to give this one a try. We had the peri peri chicken with spicy rice as a side. Overall our meal had nice flavour though we thought the portions were a bit small at this price point for, essentially, a fast food chain.  If you're used to spicy (ie hot) food bypass the mild and order hot or extra hot."}
{"text":"Amazing Portuguese cuisine chicken. I loved their sauces which by the way, you could get in store (LONGOS AND WAL-MART). These fellas know how to make chick alright!   Will definitely return! Ive been to one other location on Queens St. In Brampton. This branch was bigger with twice the amount of seating.   Service was great and food arrived fairly quick."}
{"text":"Went there this evening to grab a quick bite, ordered the chicken sandwich with periperi fries, mild (lemon and herb). Chicken was dry, lots of bread one piece of lettuce and maybe two slices of tomatoes...the fries were not bad but overall overpriced and the place was very disorganized. I would not go back"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to know that they have Nando's in Canada. I went during afternoon so I'm not sure if there are more people at night, but there's enough seating for parties or people by themselves/couples. I was surprised they even have similar music to the ones in the UK. Out of sauces I noticed, they renamed the white garlic sauce to creamy dressing. They also renamed the creamy mash to garlic potatoes which the person at the till said tastes the same as the creamy mash. The chicken and everything looks similar to other Nando's spots, and the pricing is definitely a lot more affordable. Overall, food-wise, the chicken tastes about the same, I also tried the garlic bread which I had to return because it was too hard, the rice which was more seasoned than ones I had tried prior so tasted quite good, and the fries. The service was very nice and the host is from England so it was fun to chat. I'd recommend coming here if you miss things from across the pond."}
{"text":"Considering I travel from downtown Toronto to Brampton to go here I'm gonna give it 5 stars, even though I'm sure part of it is nostalgia. Also it's 5 stars for it's price point, it's kind of like a African/Portugese Swiss Chalet.  Nando's is a worldwide chain. They've been in Canada for awhile but this location is relatively new which is great because it's clean, the service is great, the food has been consistently good and fresh, it's not too busy so they still take care in their food, and I'd say it's maybe even better than some of the locations I've visited abroad.  I particularly love the Nando's Familia combo; a whole flame grilled chicken, 2 kebabs, choice of salad, 1 regular side, and 1 large side. Great for feeding about 3-4 adults, $35.99  I've had the Mediterranean and the spring salad and they've both been great.  But what they're know for is their Peri-Peri chicken. From what I can gather off their website, peri-peri is a chili from Africa that the Portuguese started using in their cooking. They developed this style of preparing chicken, marinading, flame grilling, and basting the chicken with a mix of peri-peri and other spices.   At Nando's you can choose the degree of heat. I usually get the lemon and herb and add the heat with one of their side sauces. Personal favourite is the Garlic Peri-Peri sauce.  For sides, I really love their rice, and corn but I'm told corn is seasonal at this location.  Overall, consistently good food, fresh, and affordable = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time..  Had the half chicken with hot... Pretty spicy and the chicken  very flavourful..  I am Portuguese descent and this is good chicken for sure.   And the prices are pretty descent to.."}
{"text":"Since being introduced to Nando's, I am starting to notice there are locations closer to me than Barrie.  Today I was passing by at the perfect time-lunch!  This is a much smaller location than Barrie, but the same menu.  I ordered some chicken with medium heat and doused it in the delicious Garlic sauce.  For a side, I ordered the peas, which was dramatically different that Barrie.  Here, the peas were somewhat drier, and very spicy.  I'll chalk this up to variations that creep into franchise locations.  Overall, this is saved as a favourite in my nav system, along with every other Nando's I pass by."}
{"text":"Well this is the first time I've ever given a  5 star  review for food that was just a wee bit less than Amazing. Maybe it's the fact that I haven't been to Nando's  in a while or this new location with its outstanding food and Decor has really gone upscale for this brand. Take for example the funky unisex washrooms with a long vanity to wash your hands as you're going to need to clean up is eating well requires sometimes to get your hands dirty. So onto the food. So on to the food. The grilled barbecued wings were outstanding. Juicy and moist. Probably some best non fried wings I ever had.  Added on the house made peri peri sauce on the side for heat. The coleslaw salad with fresh and homemade.  The only one slight disappointment was the premium quinona salad for $12. Some of the guacamole didn't look so good and the whole thing look like it was just brought together was no theme or sense.  Overall still highly recommended and will return again. Galito their main competition down the street is nothing compared to them. Forgot to mention they also serve beer here now."}
{"text":"So happy they put a location in Scarborough! I've always wanted to try Nando's but the locations were out of the way so I never got a chance. This place is absolutely five stars. Everything from the decor, customer service, taste, and even the music is perfect. We came in on a Saturday for lunch. I ordered the peri peri Caesar wrap with the wedge fries and my boyfriend ordered the 1/4 chicken with the spiced rice. The flavors were spot on. We ended up sharing each other's plates because they were both so good. Towards the end of our meal the manager came and greeted us and asked us what we thought of our meal.  Thank you, Maria, for making our first impression so great."}
{"text":"Loved the fact that chicken is grilled!  Lovely char flavor on my quarter chicken with medium sauce.  I got the Peri Peri fries as my side.  My friend got the chicken sandwich with regular fries and grilled veggies.   Service was friendly and fast.  Loved that you could try the other sauces on the side.   Only criticism was that I did find my chicken to be a little dry.  My friend loved her sandwich,  especially the Portuguese bun.  Also,  if you are a veggie lover,  try their grilled side,  very nice flavour!   I also really liked the concept of paying for your food before eating,  it was efficient fast food service with the comfort of a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm glad to have a Nando's close to my house- it's always a hit! Love the medium spices - do not order hot as its way too spicy. Bathrooms were clean and service was great! Love the chocolate cake dessert"}
{"text":"I came across this Nandos location randomly while looking for a place to eat, I was so excited there's finally a Nandos not too far from home. As always their food is amazing. I also like that this location is quite big and very nicely decorated! I had a good time!"}
{"text":"This isn't the first time I've been to Nandos. But out of all the previous times I have visited this visit was my favourite.  The event: It was my brothers birthday. The Day: Went on Tuesday around 7:30. There multiple booths available at that time and the Restaurant was not packed at all.  Including myself, there were 5 people in total. The host seated us immediately.  For first timers thinking of going here, just know that it's a self serve restaurant. So you'll have to go the front and order. You will also have to pick up the napkins and utensils yourself. However, the food will be delivered to your table.  Now down to the food!  Pros: if you like chicken, then Nandos is the place to go. We ordered the feast meal which came with two full roasted chickens (cut into pieces), three sides and your choice of garlic bread or Portuguese buns.   Overall the food was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly but the sauce is where it's at!   I recommend you grab the extra spicy peri-peri sauce and mix it with the white salad dressing. It makes a perfect dipping sauce for the chicken.   The fries is a must! Grab it as a side but also the garlic bread as well.  Pros: Great food. No tip needed, unless your feeling generous.  Cons: Self serve. Also, it's a tad pricy."}
{"text":"As tourists from NYC, we assumed walking downtown Toronto should be fine looking for dinner options at 10:00 pm, little did we know everything closes by 10 except Nando's :) They were super nice, food was beyond amazing and freshly served despite the late hours (late by toronto standard ;) )"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating :(   This place was not as clean as I would have liked to see it. We had a pesky fly flying sprung the dining area the whole time we were there, and no one like bugs trying to land on their food while they eat.   The \"servers\" and staff were not the friendliest and when you dine in, you are expected to top before you even really receive any service in the dining area which I find odd, how can I gauge how much to tip before you serve me? What if I under tip? Or over tip?   My dad said chicken was a bit dry. Rice was good and so were the mashed potatoes. Over all a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"This is a new location on Queen West, with a great patio! It's my second time at a Nando's, and the first time at this location. It is a huge space with good service. You go up to the counter to order, but servers assist you with seating and bring your meal to the table.  I really, really like the chicken and the spicy rice. I am also a big fan of the sweet potatoes. I can't wait to go back and try everything else they have!"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken place in town. Come here regularly but am only now checking in on yelp.  My favorite is the double leg medium spicy with piri fries."}
{"text":"The worst place I have been to this year.  Whole chicken did not have one drumstick, which was substituted to one skewer without letting me know.   Employees keep eating something but I have no clue what it was.  Management did not bother to check what was wrong. Just asked me to take the chicken home with full refund.  not happy. Very disappointed. Worst place ever"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. It's as if many of the employees think the customers are there for them.  The initial order was a rushed process which I had to slow down to allow our large party, which includes people who haven't dined at a Nandos to view the menu. When ordered, the spice levels were taken, but the kitchen messed up the spice level on two orders. When this was brought up, we were initially blamed for why the order was incorrect. We pulled out the receipt, but the server grabbed the two entrees and took them back. Within a minute she was back with the \"new\" entrees and said the kitchen made the error. It looked like they just added more seasoning rather than to re-do the meal causing the spice level to be much greater than ordered. Each party member had also asked for a water, yet only two were brought out. When asked, the server then said only two were on the receipt and again tried to blame us as the reason we didn't get beverages. For those who had their food prepared correctly, they enjoyed it. Having gone to other Nandos in the US, it was disappointing to eat here. Looking at the reviews, it appears this is not abnormal. Hopefully someone from management will actually try to improve the place."}
{"text":"Great place for veggie people. I love the veggie pita. So awesome. Family owned so they care about their clients."}
{"text":"an unexpected find on a sunday night in a retail shopping area thanks to yelp! we swung by around 8pm and the fast-food-looking spot was surprisingly packed with locals! we ordered the chicken breast with peri fries. the fries were lightly seasoned but otherwise typical but the roasted chicken was moist, fresh, and tasty. you order it from a scale of garlic-lemon (not spicy) to very spicy. we opted for the spicy and it had some nice kick that wasn't too painful at all.   the only con - while portions are pretty decent it's a touch expensive for being a fast food spot. a great place to go with a group of at least 4 to order the family meals to get a variety of side dishes. if we lived here, we'd come back!"}
{"text":"I like that you can dine in, no tip necessary. Food quality is great, tasty Chicken. Unfortunately everything a few dollars too much. 1/4 white w a small side about 13 bucks, should be 2 sides for that price.  Or cheaper meals.  There are certain restaurants that have prices that eliminate regular visits, this is one of them."}
{"text":"Tried Nandos for the first time ... Got a quarter chicken with 2 sides mashed potatoes and a cessation salad . Well the chicken was tiny and I mean tiny..  I mean it was so small I and my buddy's could have eaten like 3 of them each !!  If your hungry don't get this dish !"}
{"text":"Came to this location twice, unfortunately, got food poisoning the second time around. I had it to go the first time around, then sat down with my wife to eat it the second time. I ate most of my chicken. I cut into the thigh piece.. I saw blood close to the bone. I informed the waitress, asked her if they can cook it further.. Very politely. She informed me that .. All their chicken is like that.. Which is weird because I've been to Nando's about 3-4 times before (including other locations) and it was never bloody. She did bring another piece for me, plus an extra leg.. I appreciated that. Once I got home, I probably had one of the worst nights in a long time. Threw up multiple times, along with diarrhea.. Did not have any appetite for the next 2 days. It was horrible. Never again do I want to go there again. Taste wise, yes, it's great. I was a huge fan. But the food poisoning really turned me off.. I still give it a respectable 3 stars.. Based on the taste and service. But please be careful with your chicken. I don't care how all the chicken is.. If it's bloody.. It's not cooked right. Simple as that. Don't argue and try to justify the blood in the food."}
{"text":"I've had Nando's chicken before in The U.K. and it was a decent experience. This location is my first time having it in Canada.   Upon entering, it looks like a casual eatery with a cashier in front of the entrance.  This restaurant is quite spacious with many seats. We were greeted immediately and they explained to us that we order from the counter and they will bring the food to our table.   Me and my friend ordered the whole chicken combo to share. This set comes with garlic bread and a large side.   Service: the service is great here. Servers are very friendly and they are often walking around the restaurant ensuring that customers have what they need.   Food: the food was decent. Nothing really stood out to me. The chicken was tender and flavorful but I think it was overpriced for just \"decent\" chicken."}
{"text":"Never again. Don't expect Portuguese quality food, this this not Portuguese. Portions are tiny, food comes cold, no service. No management to deal with upset customers. Very confusing concept."}
{"text":"I love the chicken and flavouring here ! I always leave satisfied even when I didn't feel like Nandos upon walking into the restaurant, and that is pretty impressive"}
{"text":"Service is usually slow at this location, but the food is great! I usually get the half chicken and side of fries. Sauces are great. All the meat is Halal at this location."}
{"text":"I am a fan now.  This was my first time getting Portuguese Chicken and let me tell ya, I was not disappointed. Chicken was crazy good. I had the taste in mouth for 2 days.  For ambiance, eating area was too small tables were just stacked right next to each other, wait staff need some training.   No complaint about the food,"}
{"text":"I've been on a grilled chicken binge as of late, and that's what made me drive to Nando's despite the long commute from work (with only a one hour lunch...Sorry boss). For those living under a rock, Nando's serves up Peri-peri chicken and celebrates Portugese fast cuisine. There was nothing that fast about the place but you can't blame them for having a full house at lunch time here in Heartland Town Centre.  I got the Double Leg Chicken meal with 1 side, Spiced Rice ($11.25). Nando's Chicken is marinated in their special spices and served hot, mild, lemon peppery, or medium. The chicken legs weren't the largest, but they were grilled so well that it fills your nostrils even before you take that first bite. The chicken was a bit dry, but there's no denying the taste of damn good grilled chicken. The rice isn't very spiced as I found it a bit bland, but it was moist and is tossed with bell peppers for taste.   You go to Nando's when you are in the mood for grilled chicken. They take your order up front and then you'll grab their giant numbered stick to your table in which the servers will recognize you. Good place for lunch but be prepared for a wait during lunch time. You could be waiting for a while."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy Nando's and I'm glad more of their restaurants in this chain are opening up. This location, in particular, appears to be rather new and it really looks great. The interior is pretty modern and clean, as well as the dining area and facilities. For those who have never been, Nando's serves up Portugese chicken but for most to enjoy.   I had what I always have...half chicken with fries. I really like the chicken at Nando's because of how well they get the sauce coating the chicken. The plate is about $16, which is pricey, but good food. The portion size was alright as my chicken did look a bit small and the sides seem to be smaller than I can recall. However, the chicken meat is moist with perfect skin and the sides are done well.   As with most locations, you are given a table number and once assigned, you can then go up and order your food. You'll also pay for it here. Server will bring it out. Fast comes out hot and quick."}
{"text":"Nandos is good if your just hungry and want to eat anything but if your looking for a good quality meal this is not the spot to be. The concept is all self serve & just not my first choice but it was convenient and we were hungry so we made due.   The location is great & the decor is cute plus it has a nice patio so it's nice for a summer day."}
{"text":"In some quarters, Swiss Chalet is nearly the state religion of Canada. It's a sit down restaurant, offering a decent chicken meal, nice portions, and prices aren't bad. Christmas they throw in a bit of candy and the blue haired set goes wild. Wild.   So a chicken restaurant like Nando's is going to be fairly compared against the Chalet.   All 'n' all it's a nice chicken place when you're bored of the Chalet. You get a spice option: mild (aka lemon and herb, medium, hot, and some kind of suicide hot level).   I tried the quarter chicken mild. My \"date\" (ahhhh my great unrequited love from high school... thank you magic of Facebook!) took it spicy. In my nervousness I kind of forgot to ask her what she thought of it.   The Perri fries (a seasoned fry way better than that horrid crap Harvey's tried to sling on us years back) are quite good. The chicken, ostensibly done in the Portuguese/Kenny Rogers Roasters way, was nice 'n' juicy and a bit different.  Seating is a bit tight and the place seems to get quite packed by 8 pm. It's in that Heartland outlet shopping big box Elysium minicity place in Mississauga and probably makes for a good way to wind up a post-work day shopping expedition.  It's also a decent non-threatening place to meet your old high school unrequited love. It's not romantic, it's just clean, and if she lets you pay it's not like you're dropping $80 on her and you're going to demand she pays the piper.  Oh yeah it's on the north west side of the intersection."}
{"text":"Went to Nando's at heartland for the first time after a friend's introduction.  I got the 1/4 chicken leg and thigh in lime and herb (the least spicy type). The chicken was very delicious and tasteful, even though a bit more salty and more fat in it than I expected.   I personally can't take spicy food, but the friend I went with was completely satisfied by their spicy sauce - he usually takes suicide level at wild wings lol. They have tons of different types of sauces on the side for you to choose from. If you are a spice fan, you will enjoy this place even more.   Reasonably priced. Could be very busy during weekday lunchtime."}
{"text":"The chicken was great! Good portions for a decent price. Would go back for the chicken!"}
{"text":"Though hubby and I come here quite often, I had a bad experience today with their quinoa salad- if I'm paying $12 for a salad BC it is called \"quinoa, squash, and avocado\" then I expect it to have these ingredients.  zero squash and 1 little piece of HARD avocado.The chicken portions and Their sides are also just enough to feed a small bird. Perri Perri no more."}
{"text":"Well it's Portuguese style chicken or so they say it is.  It's run by middle eastern people, not a big deal but that's like going into a Japanese restaurant and you see Greek people there.  Maybe it's just me, I dunno, it's really not that important I suppose.  I personally find that the chicken doesn't really taste like Portgugese rotisserie, I mean that's just my opinion.  In the words of Levar Burton \"You don't have to take my word for it\"  The seating for this place is really small//i8"}
{"text":"Nando's is okay.  If you want to have a quick meal with cheap prices and okay food then go for it! If you go in with that expectation, then you'll most likely enjoy your experience.   My partner and I have eaten there around three times and what drives us back is their hot peri peri sauce. Would definitely recommend trying it if you are in the mood for some spice!   The service is okay. The staff sometimes smiles at us if we make eye contact with them but for the most part, I just feel like we are a burden to them.   But yea, Nando's is okay."}
{"text":"I like Nando's and it is always a treat to see a new one open at this location. The location is apt with plenty of parking spaces. The set up is pretty and vibrant - there is a lot of seating space available. They serve liquor (wine and beer). So, one can enjoy the chicken with some nice wine. The food is nice and has the consistent experience and taste like any other Nando's. The staff is warm and friendly- the Manager was super responsive. The washrooms are clean and the music is good. I have no hesitations in giving them a five star. Hope the folks maintain the same energy and service!"}
{"text":"We had a whole chicken, medium peri-peri (which was the quintessential Medium in fact, *just* spicy enough for us) and the coleslaw.   The chicken was phenomenal- juicy, flavorful, yummy! But the slaw was flavorless. Which is still okay, since the chicken was phenomenal! Bought some of their Medium peri-peri sauce to take home too."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a late lunch on a Saturday while doing errands in the area.  The restaurant was packed when we arrived, and we had to wait to be seated.  The host was friendly and accommodating.  I did find their \"system\" to be quite strange.  Once we were seated, we reviewed the menus, and then had to get up to place our order and pay the cashier.  Guests are expected to remember their table number, as the food is delivered by a server to the table.  But one still has to get their own cutlery, napkins, non-alcoholic drinks, etc...  I suppose the model could be compared to that of Panera, except that at Panera, patrons generally pay first and then select their own table.  (And the cutlery arrives with the meal.)  The food was good, and reasonably priced.  My husband had the 1/4 chicken (leg & thigh) with PERi-PERi fries on the side, and I had the PERi-PERi chicken sandwich with PERi-PERi Vegetables on the side.  I like spicy food, but opted for medium just to be safe.  It was nowhere near hot enough for my liking, and I ended up adding a fair amount of the \"extra hot\" hot sauce.  All in all, a good experience despite the unconventional model.  We will likely come back to this location when we are in the area, and will probably end up trying the Queen West location as well."}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I begin?   A friend ordered a half chicken (knowing that it comprises of a leg and a thigh) and got the tiniest thing I have ever seen.  Looked like a quail. I mean the plate even looked too big for that piece of chicken. It just looked weird. Looked more like a baby quail. lol  We inquired with the server, hesitatingly, he said \"it does look smaller than usual, but I'll go get a manager for you\" and he took away the plate. Several minutes later, a man showed up with the plate, dressed in business casual attire, whom we assumed was the manager (he didn't introduce himself) and reiterated our disappointment about the size of our food, but qualified it with \"we don't choose the size of our chickens.\" It's true, and what's more, Nando's is not a chicken restaurant specialty (check the website): it's all about the sauce. If you want good chicken, don't go there. If you want ok sauce, may be pay them a visit, but I recommend you bring your own chicken, or you'll leave hungry, and confused.   So, we were given another \"half chicken\" which supposedly remedied the issue. Mind you, the (manager?) never returned to see if we were ok or reassessed how we were doing with his supposed intervention.   Of note, they're racist too! So watch out if you're Roma. When the server came to give us the second piece of chicken, he said: \"Sorry. We weren't trying to Gyp you or anything.\" WTF. That place needs some serious sensitivity training - cultural and professional.  Rude!  So....  Professionalism: one star (zero, if I could) Sensitivity: same as above Nando's sauce: two stars  Nando's chicken: Ah, what chicken?  Ugh!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Better than Swiss chalet (which I hate).  The chicken was decent, nothing to rave about in my opinion, maybe above average if Swiss chalet was the average.  Tables & chairs were sticky.  I think when I go to fast food joints the tables and chairs were cleaner than this place.  They do however have sauces on the side you can add, whether it's just flavoring or spicing it up they have 4 sauces.  It's a self serve restaurant so prices r slightly lower than some sit down restaurants.  I think Tips are expected though, since when I was paying by machine at the front counter where you order, it asked for gratuity.  Probably wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"I love having all these new businesses open up in the SE! Nando's is definitely a popular choice, we went on the opening weekend at a sort of off time (around 4:30 pm for dinner - we're old and hungry apparently) and the place was packed! By the time we left at about a regular dinner time the lines were long and takeout was bustling. To their credit for just opening they were very organized, friendly and we received good service, the manager was also out on the floor and we could see he was quite involved with the customers and helping his staff handle the rush. Hubs loved the coca cola machine and was thrilled to get a vanilla coke.   The chicken was delicious, juicy, well cooked and we enjoyed sampling the different Peri Peri sauces, we got the meal for two and had lots of leftovers for lunches - bonus!   I later returned for a #NandosIsHere night and got to learn more about the back story to Nando's, how they started, made my own peri peri and tried their desserts. Oh my, the custard tart is so good! Now whenever I visit I will be adding that to my order. Welcome to the hood Nando's."}
{"text":"Nando's is a pretty good place. Far superior to Swiss Duck and a nice atmosphere, some of their hot sauces are really damn hot. As a silly male I had try them, thankfully they have beer.  It's a great place to go after you have been stuck in Sherway (living hell) and all the box stores off of the Queensway. Staff were very friendly and our food did not take too long"}
{"text":"Who cannot resist the temptations of chicken that is grilled in a spicy sauce. I know I can't. During my experience at Nando's, Me and my friends ordered takeout. We ordered some grilled chicken, potato wedges and garlic bread.  The chicken was flavorful and was not dry. The chicken had the perfect amount of spice and had tasty grilled marks to finish it off. The potato wedges were delicious and were the best part of the meal. The garlic bread was a bit dry and was below my expectations.    Nando's surpassed most of my expectations. The service when ordering and receiving our takeout was average. I recommend this to everyone looking for a good dinner when hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I really liked it even tho you had to go to the counter to order your food"}
{"text":"Really nice decor and staff, i always enjoy the dressings/sauces they use as well. The only downfall is that every time i eat here i go right home and piss out my ass."}
{"text":"I ate here around 9:15pm since my flight was delayed and not much was open by the airport.  Nandos is ok for a quick, affordable meal.  The chicken was spicy from the sauce, but the meat lacked any real flavor.  I have had piri piri chicken before elsewhere, even at other Nando's chains, and liked it much better.  Maybe it was due to the late hour and the fact that the chicken had been sitting a while.  They have a number of different meal options and a variety of sides.  The mashed potatoes were very good, but the veggies were not anything to speak of.  The decor is cool and they have table service.  There is nothing wrong with this place, but nothing too good going for it either."}
{"text":"I think most of the poor reviews come from people who don't understand the ordering process or that it's not a full service restaurant. This is much like a Panera Bread or similar \"fast casual\" style restaurant where you order your food at the counter and then it's brought out to you. But you are seated when you come in, so I can see how that would be confusing for some people. I don't think that warrants the bad reviews, though - like any other Nandos, the food is amazing here. Their sauces are delicious, lots of vegetarian options (which you may not assume off the bat since it's a chicken place) and they have a Coke freestyle machine :) Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Nandos in a very long time and I've been here a few times now and the experiences have been great. There was the initial hype of the place opening in Mahogany where there were long lines but that seems to have died down. My wife and I just usually call ahead and I go pick up a family meal. It's quick and easy and I barely have time to get over to the restaurant before they're calling my name because my order is ready.  The range of spiciness and sauces is great so you can dress up your chicken how you like it each time, unlike the \"Swiss\" chicken where your only option is their house sauce. There's a big range of sides all with their own unique things going on. Oh and don't forget the custard tarts! So good."}
{"text":"We had only been to a Nando's in Glasgow, Scotland so we were pleased to find it in North America. Got the Peri-Peri chicken, a mixture of Portuguese and African spices that never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Food is mediocre. I've had peri peri chicken at various spots in Toronto, this one doesn't stand out. Decoration is nice, modern furniture and lively color decor. The tart is pretty authentic!"}
{"text":"I don't like Nando's. No one showed us or gave us a table. Waited in line while people paid and then got showed to a wobbly table. Mediocre food and terrible/no service. I was polite and tipped anyway even though if you don't have waiters, there should be no tip."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night (and contrary to some other reviews), it wasn't very busy. Like others have mentioned, to order food, you have to get a table first, then walk up to the counter to order.  Ordered the \"Classic\" Sharing Platter. Realized this afterwards, but if you order the individual items separately.. it'd actually be $0.20 cheaper. Unless the portions are different, this seems pretty sleazy as you would assume the Sharing Platter is somewhat of a deal.  Onto the food, the Chicken we got seemed a little overcooked. The breast/wing portion was dry and the wing was getting burnt. The thing/leg portion was better. I remembered the chicken much better in general at the other locations though. Fries were okay. Garlic bread was good.  Ordered a pop as well, but at this location, like half the drinks were unavailable. No iced teas, and no juices. Not sure what's going on."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Sitting environment is okay. After complaining about the service, I received a very impressive response from management, and feel that they do care. I look forward to returning and giving the restaurant another try."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town.  Their chicken is moist and soft.  The skin got some crisp and smokey smell.  I ordered my chicken to be very spicy and it's great."}
{"text":"Their chicken is very good.  I love the smokiness and the slight crunch.  The spicy sauce is good."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst nandos location I have ever been to. The level of service I received today was absolutely disgusting. I don't know if the lady at the register is the owner or just a employee but her attitude towards customers was appalling. The service and the food were terrible. The fries were refried after sitting out for awhile. The chicken was dry and had no flavour.   Save yourself the trouble and don't visit this location"}
{"text":"They are extremely overpriced. The service is extremely slow. The quantities keeps shrinking every year. Not worth it at all. Might as well go to Galitos for a better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Delicious and service was great. Didn't give it five stars because some of the chicken was burnt. All in all would recommend if you don't really like chicken like me. The chicken here is not dry and is very well seasoned so it is definitely a go to spot if you're in the area and feeling for some chicken!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. The woman that took my order did not seem like she wanted to be there at all. Super crowded in a Friday night. Their entry area is way too small for the amount of people coming in. Garlic bread seemed stale and very tough to chew through. Flavour was good though. The chicken was good and moist. Only recommendation for the restaurant is to have better lighting on their menu that is on the wall. It was so dark in there I could barely see the small fonts and it was not lit at all. Making it extremely hard to read anything.   Update. Went and got the 1/4 chicken thigh and leg I just can't believe they charge so much for such a small piece of chicken"}
{"text":"I could probably eat Nando's chicken everyday and be great with that. I really dig the peri peri flavors.   4/5 stars because if I ate Nando's chicken everyday, I would be broke. Not really the cheapest place, yet it has a fast-food feel. Also this location is greasy. Change your mop water! Gross."}
{"text":"Really liked the Garlic Peri Peri sauce. Chicken was cooked to perfection, pita was fresh and warm and the Caesar salad was also very good. Will definitely be back... have to try to hot Peri Peri sauce next. Only the slow service marred the experience but even that was (mostly) forgotten when the food arrived and I took the first bite."}
{"text":"I love going to this Nando's location, the staff is so friendly and it's rarely busy. The Ambiance is excellent! The only problem I have with this place is the outside Lighting on the building is very poor and I never know if it's open or not.   Today we came here after doing a bit of shopping in the plaza and the waitress advised us that there was a new dish on the menu... The Mozambique chicken. It comes with a half chicken, one side and this damn Delicious corn tomato onion salsa with a peach dressing. It's like a party in my mouth.  They have a new mango/lime sauce which is incredible! The food came out very quickly and was delicious!  Unfortunately I ate the food too fast to take any pictures... Maybe next time I'll post some!   Overall, I strongly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite place in Markham for chicken, the spices and sauce are great. The garlic bread is not that great, the fries are ok, but it's all about the chicken really juicy"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much when I walked into Nando's. Place was really nice and spacious. A little confusing when it comes to ordering. Staff told us to take a table and a menu, pick something and order it from the counter and then it will be full service. With the amount of staff they have on the floor, mind as well have a full table service so the staff can get tipped properly and we won't have to walk to the counter to order. Food was really good. We ordered chicken thigh, chicken wings and french fries to share. We ordered it mild since I can't handle spicy, but my brother asked for some spicy sauce on the side and he loved it. Portion was good and service was lovely. Will come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This Nandos looks much better and specious than most of other locations. I have been there few times, and as per my first experience I would definitely give it a 4.5 star. The chicken were well cooked, staff were very friendly and polite.   But in my last visit, I found both the quality of food and staff both has taken a downward dip. The chicken was undercooked, as well as missing that great taste!!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Nando's we've visited, this is by far the best! They did such a nice job on the inside that it's actually a nice restaurant that you'd want to go and have dinner. There's a lot of reclaimed wood, very high ceilings, beautiful round booths for large groups and a nice sitting area while you wait for take-out.  Great atmosphere!  What can I say, Nando's is consistently good.  Last time I was there, I picked up some grilled wings and was served by a really nice girl named Iesha.  The staff at this location is so friendly and they always give you enough hot sauce, napkins, disposables, etc.   I'm reluctant to give it five stars just because, as everyone knows, Nando's is a bit on the pricey side.  I think 4.5 stars is fair."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really desperate for takeout this evening but we were not feeling for our usual spots so we decided to try Nando's.  Any one who thinks the food here is five stars clearly hasn't tried Brasas in Mississauga or doesn't care for seasoned food. We ordered the Family Pack that offers 2 Whole Chickens and three Nando's sides with Garlic bread.  The food quantity was quite puzzling to me. If I'm not mistaken bread costs more than rice so I'm confused as to why I got a huge bag of garlic bread (10 or more slices) whilst I got a small Chinese style container of rice that could only feed two people.  The Chicken didn't taste fresh either and was quite under seasoned. The coleslaw was not so creamy either so why call it creamy style??   This place is more of a Fast Food Portuguese restaurant than an authentic Portuguese restaurant.  So far I haven't found a place that tops Brasas so I guess I'm going to have to continue making the trek out to Mississauga...   I will not be back but I would recommend it to people who don't particularly care for swooned food."}
{"text":"Utterly disgusted.  I went by for lunch awhile back. I was waiting for my take out and the people in the kitchen kept looking out.  I remember feeling like something was up. They were speaking in their own language between the counter staff and the kitchen and looked at me a couple times.  I left the restaurant. I was in my car and started to eat. I was reluctant to eat the food after the feeling I got form in the restaurant. But then I though I was just paranoid.  I too one bite and out comes some long dirty black hair. Getting sick now thinking about it.  I'm pretty convinced It was deliberate. I could never eat it again.   Fucking dirty bastards."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was exquisite! Ordered 2 more whole chicken for take-out. Protocol: Secure a table; Place order at order desk/pay. Food will be delivered to your table.  Excellent service from Nadia.  Crispers are better than their fries. Chicken is moist and flavourful!  Ambiance is modern."}
{"text":"I love Nando's and have been craving it since my last trip to South Africa, so it made my day to find one in Toronto.  The Peri Peri Sweet Potato fries are just as good as I remembered as is the chicken sandwich.  They even have an Endless Froyo option now at $3.99, which is always tempting.  The staff are very friendly and now I don't have to cross the ocean!"}
{"text":"I have known about Nando's chicken for many years and recall last having it in Vancouver about 20 years ago. What started as a small chain in the West is growing in Ontario. Finally I had to try it out.  And after ordering a half chicken with one side, and paying close to $16, I realized that while the chicken is good, its not that good. There are many Portuguese chicken places that serve the same amount of chicken and similar or better for about half the price.  Although at the same price as Swiss Chalet, I would say Nando's is better. The interior of the place seemed a little tropical/seafood in design, the cost of the chicken must reflect the money put into the interior. Unless you plan to eat in the restaurant, as a take-out service, Mario's BBQ chicken is way better!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Swiss Chalet chicken when eating here and I'm not a big fan of Swiss Chalet. I found the chicken pieces served to be small and dry, maybe even over cooked at times. Have to agree with Kyle G. - the layout is a bit weird. It felt more like a school cafeteria to me than an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd say it was a pretty bad experience overall. Came with a group of my cousins, almost 6 of us in total. We ordered the full pack to share with 4 of cousins, two of us didn't eat meat at the time. The full pack comes with a whole chicken, 2 sides & garlic bread all for $35.99. Then we ordered the portobello mushroom & halloumi, which is essentially portobello mushroom with veggies in a wrap. We got that with two sides for $13.00.   Personally, the sides were the worst part of the dish. We got the spiced rice, garlic mashed potatoes, fries & corn on the cob. All of which were really bad. The mashed potatoes tasted like straight up garlic powder. The corn wasn't sweet nor juicy. The spiced rice tasted like just turmeric & the fries weren't even really crispy.   The veggie dish wasn't good, and barely enough to share even with the two side dishes. It just tasted like something I could make at home & was very soggy.   The chicken wasn't anything special either, lacked flavour. On top of that they barely even had any of the dipping sauces, which we had to ask for at least 5 times.   The food wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"First time going to Nando's with the Fam jam. we went on a weekday evening, fairly packed inside. Tbh the service here was okay and pretty fast considering it got more busy later on as soon as sat down.  We ordered the party pack since it was about 7 of us and it was a lot of chicken i think it was about 2 whole chickens with plenty of sides with included garlic bread and peri peri fries. Which is basically fries with some sort of red spice on them, really good. Gives it a bit of a kick to em. Theres different kinds of chicken sauces they have here, we got the lemon herb sauce which is pretty tasty if you dont want a spicy sauce. As far as portuguese chicken, i think that this chicken is not authentic portuguese chicken obviously but it is tasty and fresh and fully cooked. In other words its still good. When you get here the deal is you order and pay first and then sit down or take it to go. Overall i think ended up paying close to $60 for the party pack which is awesome considering how much food you are getting. I wouldnt mind coming back here..."}
{"text":"Nando's is a drug! How else can they get all that flavour into their chicken!  For the uninitiated, Nando's a big chain of Piri Piri style roasted chicken hailing from Europe. It's big on flavour and a great alternative to Swiss Chalet (better in my opinion).  The Quarter Chicken meals are great and can be served with 1 or 2 sides. I opted for the 2 side option and was happy with the amount provided. You can get either leg or breast meat. The leg option is smaller than the breast option and for the $1 difference, go for the breast option.  The quarter chicken is bigger than the skewers, which are a bit small. As for the sauces, they all have amazing flavour. The extra spicy option definitely has a kick, but wouldn't be earth shattering if you're already used to eating lots of spicy food.  Coleslaw, rice, potato's, and wedges were all massively popular with all involved. The veggies were a bit of a let down.  One note, you have to go up and order, and yes they DO have wine and beer (joy)!  If you're in a spicy mood, drop by and welcome to flavour country."}
{"text":"Bought a whole chicken there. It was very tasty, but over-priced at $17-ish. Also, the chicken was not large. For my money, I can get a larger chicken which is just as tasty for $11 - $12 from other place. Nothing special about this place besides the sauces, which I actually am a big fan of. Great for use at home, but I don't see the appeal in any of their other food here"}
{"text":"I was impressed with Nandos.  The location was clean and the staff, a family operation was extremely friendly.  When I walked in I thought it was just another Chicken rotisserie place with showcasing chicken a few ways.  The chicken was juicy and had nice flavour.  The peri-peri was evident on the fries and in the chicken - - complimentary flavours - - which are key.  The rice and fries are a nice side.  I will be interested to test more of the menu."}
{"text":"I didn't dine in. I went Nando's for take out and ordered a \"peri peri chicken\" sandwich with a side nandos potato wedges for my boyfriend. When I walked in the restaurant one of the servers greeted me and showed me where to order take out. The menu isn't too confusing it's pretty self-explanatory, I didn't have to ask any questions to the server.   The sandwich came out in about 12 minutes. Presentation wise it was lacking but what can I really expect for ordering takeout. The chicken breast was really juicy but the bun could be a bit fresher... it was stale.   Overall I would like to dine in the restaurant next time and not order take out just to see if there's a difference in the food quality."}
{"text":"Great service. Food came really quick. Almost immediately we were given a plate of garlic bread to munch on. Staff were friendly. Food was good. I would recommend getting the fries and ofcourse chicken :) Will be back to tryother things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was ok, chicken portions are smaller than other nando's. The manager totally brought my experience to a 1 star though. When we first came in, she gave us attitude because we were unsure if we had a table of 12 or 13. Seriously?! There's no need to snap at us for 1 extra person, we already told the other waiter that we were ok to squeeze the extra person if necessary. Secondly, she smokes right outside the back door leading into the dining room. Not only does it make it really cold but the smell of smoke filled the room for the duration of our dinner. Yes, I do love being cold and eating in a smelly room...it's my favourite smell if you were asking! Seriously though, I love Nando's but I will not be back at this location ever."}
{"text":"Food is good as always! Unfortunately service is horrible! They are rude, pushy, and are annoyed to give you any type of help! REPLACE MANAGEMENT ASAP! poor employees get treated like garbage in front of you!"}
{"text":"TOTAL GARBAGE FIRE. Highly do not recommend. Operational mess, staff has no idea what to do. They take your order and make you wait FOREVER. Today, I did not get my order BC I just could not stand waiting anymore. Just total chaos, you're better off going elsewhere for mediocre chicken."}
{"text":"I always pass by this restaurant, but I've never stepped foot into it until now. To order, you go up the the register and tell them what you want and pay upfront, then your food gets delivered to your table.   I'd have to say that the portion was very small. I ordered a 1/4 chicken with a side of fries, and I could probably eat 3 of those. I'm an average sized person.   The chicken was alright, but nothing too special. Needless to say, I wasn't full when I was finished with my meal.   I'd probably not come back again unless they increased the portion size."}
{"text":"Finally, Nandos in SE Calgary!! After eating my way through locations in 4 different continents now its a short drive away.   I'm an extra hot guy, and love the beans as my side. The red pepper dip is awesome as a starter, as is the grilled cheese. Now if they would only bring the chicken breast to Canada, and the extra extra hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight with my family. We ordered one of the shareable platters, an extra side and a small salad.   The service was good, our order came out promptly and they checked up on us a few times throughout the meal to see if we needed anything.  The garlic bread was awesome as usual, the bread is soft and moist, the buttered side was nice, crispy and flavourful.   The mediteranian salad was nice, the vegetables were fresh, crisp and tasted clean and refreshing. The vinagrette overpowered the feta cheese though.  The spiced rice wasn't really my cup of tea, it felt a bit dry, but I'm accustomed to steamed rice.  The peri-peri fries were yummy. Crispy exterior while the middle is nice and soft. The coating of peri-peri salt was a bit lacking though, some pieaces had a nice amount others seemed like regular fries, so it wasn't as falvourful as previous visits. Still quite pleasant though.  As for the chicken, it was a generous portion. The sauce was nice and flavourful but the chicken was a bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"This place sprung up so quick I didn't even know it existed for sometime until I finally realized it was there so I decided to try it out.  I'm not entirely sure how to start this review as this place truthfully confused me.... I do believe its a Portuguese Chicken place but what kind of establishment I cannot say, It appears to be a mixture of cafeteria and restaurant with a touch of fast food which is needless to say a little off putting, I will explain further ;)  Let me start by saying the decor is rather impressive considering they claim to be going for a more casual and family atmosphere... I feel like its way more trendy and modern but beautiful none the less. The layout of the place is where I feel it starts to fall short though with crammed tables and large, almost useless horse shoe booths that offered nowhere to hang jackets. This made the space seem a little cluttered and confusing with inconveniently placed main arteries and walkways that made for a fair bit of traffic around the self serve touch screen pop dispenser. This is another thing that put me off a little, I expect to see something like this in a fast food place not a restaurant, they had a full bar so I was baffled to see this machine there and where it was which was as I said causing so much traffic that many people were opting out of getting their drinks to wait for an \"opening\".  A rather metro gentleman escorted myself and my friend to a huge horse shoe booth located at the back wall beside the self serve pop machine which I felt was kind of a waste as a larger group could have sat there but he told us how the whole thing works and essentially you walk up to the bar and order. From there you can also order from a small and I will say horribly overpriced and unimpressive selection of wines or you can serve yourself at this \"handy\" machine they have provided for you. The same area as this machine also has ALL of your cutlery and dining needs including sauces and condiments so you can imagine how busy that small, confined space gets. I was actually shocked when someone brought the food to the table as I was expecting to cook it myself at this point lol!  Anyway, on to the food which I am going to say off the top is WAY too expensive for Portuguese food especially! We ended up getting the variety platter to share and it was basically a shit load of chicken... pardon my language but that's the truth of it. A giant wad of meat to digest and because it was all chicken there was no variety.... even the different sauces tasted very similar to me. The two sides were TINY and nothing to write home about.   I usually adore Portuguese chicken so for me not to like this was a rarity and at the price they are charging I really wasn't impressed so unless there is some unforeseen reason to return I probably won't be"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this Nando's tonite (Nov 17/14). Very solid meal. The chicken was char-grilled to perfection & had a delicious taste. The garlic bread was surprising very taste. The only issue was the less then hot rice. All-in-all a very meal & worth a do over."}
{"text":"Wow! This was a very tasty meal!   Ordered the 1/4 Chicken Medium with Potato Wedges & coleslaw. The chicken was tender, tasty & delicious. Potato wedges were a big order with lots of taste, coleslaw was average in taste.   The service was fastish but in their defence the place was jammed with lunch goers.   I'd definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, great atmosphere and delicious food. I got the Chicken Sandwich with peri peri fries, and it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"I went back here to pick up food with the dinner vouchers we got from our previous bad visit. I am updating my review because this time the experience was better and the manager really tried to make sure we were happy. He went out of his way and provided exceptional service. The food was good and we were pleased with the manager since he remembered us and tried his best to make our visit better this time. Thank you for that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  They opened about a month and a half ago and I have been here 4 times already.  The decor is comfortable and colorful.  The staff is friendly and engaging.  The price is appropriate for the quality.  I have ordered the familia pack every time I go and switch up the sides.  Favorite side that you have to pay extra for is the Peri-Peri beans.....super delicious.  The chicken is amazing as well.  Overall a new go-to staple for the Etobicoke area."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. My family has been eating here since they opened and time after time we ignored the poor customer service and quality control issues. They do not apologize for ROTTEN food, burnt food, wrong/missing items, smaller quantities of foodetc. Their prices have gone up and quality way down. They tell my mom she is wrong about her complaints? Today they would not look me in the eye or apologize when i explained to them about the disgusting old batch of rice they gave me. They simply said do you want a new one or money?  The couple that owns this location have no idea what customer service is. The food isn't spectacular or worth the hassle and money anymore. Go to the new location near by!!!!"}
{"text":"So so good! Amazing and flavorful food & great portions. Also fast service--came in a group of 20 people and our food came out in 15 mins!! Visited from the states & will def go back once I'm in Canada again!"}
{"text":"I usually come here on weekend nights (don't recommend this at all), when you're craving it, you're craving it.  The food is great, large portions so it's great value for your money.   This is a much cleaner location IMO than the Heartland one in Mississauga.  I usually get the Double Skewers with the Peri Peri rice (fave!) & my boyfriend gets the double leg with the wedges.   Can't go wrong with Nando's."}
{"text":"It was father day on Sunday, we planned to go to Nando,s   inside was  too crowded , we were told to order and then get a number and the girl will call us as soon as the table is ready. We were family of 5. We had to wait for more than half hour, then decided to take our order to go, then the girl said please wait for another 10 minutes. We waited and then finally we got the table , the food came , but no sorry for the wait time or anything, and the food wasnt like soo good that we would enjoy and forget the wait time we had to go thru."}
{"text":"I already loved Nando's, and now this is my new favorite location.  Firstly the staff is wonderful and friendly. Someone is always around to help you out if you need it.  The food is always consistently good. We usually get a family pack which has a whole chicken, 2 large sides and garlic bread. It is easily enough to feed 4, at least in my house. You can ask for different flavors for half the chicken. So we got half extra hot and half medium hot. For sides we got the peri peri fries and the rice.  The food was delicious, filling and reasonably priced.  Lastly, the best part about this Nando's is the awesome patio. It's large and bright and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Tins of people love Nandos and I get why the foods delicious! Order about 20 minutes early or be prepared sit around and wait for your food for 30 minutes. I ordered the chicken breast with rice and piri-piri fries it was great but it comes out to just under $16. Which i find overpriced since Galitos is $10 and just as good,the foods delicious fresh and filling.   The wait time is insane I came in to pick up my order and this indecisive man was ahead of me, the girl running the cash should have handed him the take away menu an asked him to step aside so she could continue to help customers but instead she stood there with him being indecisive like please ask him to move over so that I can pick up my food.   The food was good but I was just too annoyed after having to wait for my food that i preordered.   I will be back cause Nandos is great and I work in the area."}
{"text":"Service: (4 stars) Friendly, but no table service.  You order the food at the counter and pay for it, and they deliver it to your table.  There is an option for tipping (really not a fan of asking for tip before the food gets delivered)  You get your own knives, forks, sauces...  Atmosphere: (4 stars) A great large patio, but without any umbrellas, can get really sunny/hot during the day. I did not go there for a beer (and the prices were not on the menu) but looks like a nice place to have a beer on a Friday after work.  Food: (4 stars) A friend and I got the variety sharable (see picture, cost was $34 after taxes).  The chicken was juicy and a pretty good portion size.  For sitting down the price is worth it, but I would not recommend doing take-out."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple other locations and found them a little better for a few reasons. Without naming the other nandos, they seem to have better decor, atmosphere, and service.   That's not to say this one is terrible. It's just a more fast food version Compared to the others I've been too. The chicken is delicious across the board. But the atmosphere here feels like you're at a Wendy's. Also everytime I come here the side are never hot.   Overall if you're in the area and craving some chicken or want a decent quick lunch this place recommended."}
{"text":"I recommend going elsewhere if you don't want to be skimped on your meal.   Came here with several coworkers on a Friday. Waited 10mins to order takeout (understandable given its busy) but then waited another 30mins for a simple meal while other dining orders were fulfilled.   Food portions are terribly small. The 1/4 chicken leg and thigh was really just the leg and is terrible value for money ($12 incld tax). Given this is the main item on the menu, my coworkers and I at least expected it to be equivalent to Swiss Chalet portion wise.  The environment does look nice for dine in. Drinks are available from a Coca-Cola freestyle machine, but food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Nando's was pretty hyped up to me as a Swiss Chalet competitor so I had to compare apples to apples...or...chicken to chicken rather. (Disclaimer: I know it's not exactly the same since at Nando's you go up to a counter to order and it is more of a fast food joint).  I ordered the quarter chicken leg (lemon and herb seasoning) with peri fries as the side. My food was delivered to my table pretty quickly. The food looked okay but more on the fast food side of things (presentation lacking a bit) versus what you'd get from a proper sit-down restaurant. First bite - chicken seemed a little dry and the flavour was there but not super exciting. I definitely recommend adding some more peri sauce to help the chicken along. The sauce was in bottles up front and you can grab it and bring it back to your table. The fries seemed very basic. They didn't seem that much better than frozen fries you would bake at home. The spice was sprinkled on top but wasn't really embedded in the fry.   I have heard rave reviews about Nando's. This occasion seemed a little underwhelming. I'm thinking it might have been the location or perhaps just an off day."}
{"text":"My friend took one bite of his chicken and it was majorly undercooked! When we asked the server to check it, she took it back to the kitchen and brought it as it is saying the chef said its not. He ultimately didn't even eat it though he paid for it. They were extremely rude and even when I ate my chicken, there was blood in the bone.  I think this Nando's is very poorly run."}
{"text":"This is no Nandos... at least the Nandos I know and love.  Coming from out west, where Nandos is like Starbucks, on every corner.  I can't believe I'm saying this.   But Galitos is better then this location.  And not by a small margin either.   The peri fries were too salty and not enough peri.  Celantro in the wrap (barf) and \"extra Hot\" is a mild at best.  The chicken was over roasted and dry.  The macho peas were good though.   The portions are half the size of a normal Nandos.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Nando's.  They just opened a couple weeks ago.  Nando's first opened in South Africa in 1987 and soon became famous for its Portuguese style flame-grilled chicken with a PERi-PERi (African Birds Eye Chilli) kick.  We sat on the patio.  You choose what you want from the menu and then go inside to order and pay for it.  It's kind of an odd business model because if you want a couple drinks during the evening, you have to keep going in to order them and pay for them each time rather than having everything put on a tab and you pay for it at the end.  Plus if you have to get up and order for yourself every time, you may not be include to tip.  Don't forget to pick up your utensils, napkins, hot sauces, etc.  You let them know your table so they can bring it to you when it's ready (it took about 20 minutes).  I ordered a 1/2 chicken with lemon herb sauce.  The chicken was good.  It was tender and flavourable (it tasted like BBQ) with a bit of heat.  I couldn't taste the lemon herb sauce, though.  I'd get it again.  Gord ordered plain wings with lemon herb sauce on the side and an order of cole slaw.  He said both were really good ... the chicken was tender and juicy and the cole slaw was fresh, creamy and crunchy.  He'd get them again.  I'm glad he got extra lemon herb sauce because I used it to dip my chicken in.  The napkins came in handy!  Alice was one of the servers.  She was friendly and kept checking on us to make sure everything was okay.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best restreraunts I have ever tried in my life. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the garlic bread was superb and you will never ever leave nandos thirsty  thanks to the free reefels."}
{"text":"No, no, no...  I've been to Nando's in the UK and it's a real restaurant, where you can sit down, be served, and enjoy yourself (and they stay open until 11 even on weeknights).  In Canada, it's a franchise fast-food chain that's just OK, and that's it.  They don't even serve fountain beverages (canned sodas only, and they won't even give you ice - unacceptable).  The chicken itself is still pretty good, but for what they charge I expected more.  This was a pretty big disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Jave always heard good things about Nandos.  Was not that impressesed.  Atmosphere was OK, but the chicken was dry and not all that flavourful."}
{"text":"Love peri-peri but chicken sandwich too much bland breast expected pulled. Tarts are always good. Ordered takeout as well a shared chicken plate for 3 poor choice limited fries chicken just ok."}
{"text":"Visited this place for lunch with a group of around 10 people. We were seated at the patio area. Decor was nice and the staff were very friendly. Ordered two party packages for sharing and it was more than enough for us, even had to wrap some up to go. Food came pretty quickly considering our group size and even though we were away from the main dining area, staff made sure we were well attended to. Food was pretty tasty. I especially love the peri peri rice for one of the sides."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this Nando's! I've had Nando's at another location, but many years ago, and totally forgot how to order here. The ordering procedure is really odd, and can really put off guests who are new as it can create a bit of anxiety if you are not comfortable with something \"different\" to what you are used to. I don't even have any recollection of doing this that other time I went to a Nando's in the Toronto core... Hm. I would say it was an awkward experience overall.  So the lady showed me to a table, and explained to me that when I'm ready to order that I meet her at the cash, pay for my meal, after which I can go and grab my utensils and sauces. At that point I was also wondering whether my food would be delivered to my table too...and whether I should tip. And yes they do bring your order to your table. I believe this setup is to make up for the very few staff they have... It was just the 1 cashier/server today and a lady in the kitchen at lunch time on a weekday.  So, I ordered the quarter chicken breast and wing with a regular side of peri peri vegetables ($10.45+tax). She asked if I would like to water too, which I did, and a bottle was delivered to my table...not sure if I was supposed to take the bottle myself and bring it over.  Then I went to the utensil/sauce bar. They have lots of sauces available so that any person could just take a bottle back to their table. I got a bottle of the peri peri garlic sauce. :9   My food got to my table in like 15-20 minutes. The portions seemed a little smaller than what I'm used to at say, Swiss Chalet, or supermarket rotisserie chickens. The quarter chicken breast and wing was flat, not much meat. It was very delicious though...and most importantly so moist and not dry like those supermarket rotisserie chickens! The sauce on top of my chicken had a bit of tang to it, which I was surprised by...Never had that combination with meat..it tasted really good nonetheless. Medium spiciness was good for me, not too spicy, just a bit of a kick. And the medium spice sauce went extremely well with the peri peri garlic sauce! Yum! Be warned though... this is a very messy meal. I guarantee you will need to have several napkins ready for your disposal, maybe even a bib... ruined my shirt that afternoon with some of the oil stains. :(   What I disliked about this meal was the peri peri vegetable side...It was so disappointing portion-wise and taste-wise. It was a small bowl of stir fried bell peppers and onions that were super bland and greasy. I could see the chopped garlic, but could not taste the garlic flavour at all. I have not tried any of their other sides, but judging from this, their specialty remains to be their chicken, and that I will avoid ordering sides as these are really not worth the extra $2.50."}
{"text":"Very friendly service but my chicken skewer diner was disappointingly dry. It did take about fifteen minutes to be served at my (sticky) table after ordering in an almost empty restaurant at noon, so I assume it was just overcooked not reheated.   At $17 with a drink it does not rank very highly on the value scale either therefore I will be looking elsewhere next time I feel hunger pains in North Brampton."}
{"text":"I've been to a Nandos in Richmond Hill before so I knew what to expect for the food. It is pretty pricey but because I love the flavour of the chicken, I still order it once in awhile. I would give the food 4/5, only because of small portions for what you pay.   This location is the worst though. I won't be back to this one. We ordered enough food to go for at least 3-4 people. We asked them for extra sauce (at the other location they give you a few of each type) but not here. We got ONE pack of the garlic sauce, ONE pack of ketchup, and ONE pack of the hot sauce. For THREE PEOPLE. I was extremely appalled. Do they really expect everyone to share? One drop each? I didn't enjoy my food like I usually do because I love drowning my food in sauce. But this was just bad.   Horrible service at this location. Do yourself a favour and go to any other location except this one."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing chicken. They seem to be getting busier which is great for them but not me.  Wait times seem longer for food and drinks but still is manageable. I'm afraid when they become really popular it'll be hours before were seated on a Saturday night.  They will for sure out grow their current place because if the great tasting chicken.   Oh well keep up the good work nandos."}
{"text":"We ordered the party platter recommended for 5-6 guests. The chicken was delicious and moist, service was prompt, and there was a great selection of peri-peri sauces. The party platter also included a generous serving of garlic bread and although some pieces were burnt, it was eaten nonetheless!   There is some room for improvement, however. Our platter included a choice of three \"Nando-sized\" side dishes. We ordered the rice, coleslaw and peri-peri vegetables, which was just barely enough for 4 people. I can't imagine the portion size being able to satisfy the recommended 5-6 guests. In regards to the seating arrangement, we were placed in the middle dining area tightly between a table of 6 and the self-serve beverages dispenser. It was pretty cramped, however this was a minor inconvenience.   All in all, food and service were great. Portion size of the side portions, however, could use some work."}
{"text":"let me star with a positive.   My chicken was very good.  Half chicken with the medium sauce was juicy and flavourful.    That's the only nice thing I have to say.  First off, it's an odd setup.  Wait to be seated (no sign) and then order at the counter.  $100 for takeout for a family of four seems high.  Especially when you need to get your own cutlery and condiments.   So we're sitting and I have to make notes on my cell so I can remember what everyone wants before I go order...  (New found respect for servers who memorize orders everywhere!).    Then they ask for table number...  Guess I was supposed to check that.   Wings are minuscule.  Don't bother to ask the cashier about the menu items, She clearly has no clue.  Kids sliders were almost hotter than my half chicken.  When I took the food back to the counter the manager was nice enough to offer 20% off my item as an apology....   Really?   Thanks for saving me $2!?!?!?  apparently plain means with sauce, lettuce and tomato.   Ice cream machine was out of order.   Had to ask for dessert (you know, the one we paid for?).  Fortunately they had a substitute that neither kid really liked...   Now there's clearly a lot of service issues that I had problems with, but the biggest issue was with the setup so therefore the management.   I don't even want to think about how many people tip when they pay only to have a bad experience with subpar service.   Any place that makes you pay and then have a tip button before youve had any service is just absurd in my opinion"}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat Nando's but had not been to this location before. I was doing a cpr course around the corner at Delta hotel and decided to come here for lunch with my friend. So at 12:20 lunch time...no one greeted us at the door. We had to figure out to get our own menus and approached the counter to order. We did ask if it was halal and he said yes. He then asked for our table number and we said no one had greeted us or took us to a table. So he took our order and said we could have table 10. As we paid other customers went and sat at our table. He changed our table to table 12. We went and sat. Order was made at 12:25 as per the receipt. We waited and waited. I was getting upset waiting since I had to go back to my course for 1:15. I approached the counter at 12:50 and the guys said \"2 more minutes\" for our meal to be ready. Waited some more. I was really fired up by now. Other customers who came after us were getting there meals before us...Argh!! We only ordered a leg each and some fries! AND other customers were finally being greeted at the door and were being brought their utensils and sauces!! We had to get our own!!! Our food FINALLY CAME AT 1:00!!! WOW! I was so mad that I asked the girl who brought our food for takeout containers because we literally did not have enough time to eat it all. I also added that it took so long and I made sure she heard that! Not like she cared. I scarfed down some chicken and packed the rest and left. Delicious food but TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service!!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS!! 10/10!!!! 2 big ass thumbs way up!! I live for Nando's peri peri sauce!!! This was my first time at a nandos outside of the U.K., and I wasn't disappointed!  Chicken skewers were a lil dry, not sure if that's the usual or just an off day though.  Hot peri peri sauce all over everything and problem is solved! NNNNNAAAAAANNNNNDDDDDDOOOOOOOOOOOSSSS FOR PRESIDENT!"}
{"text":"It's famous for chicken and the spice but the deserts are great too. Location is small but it's the same great sauces of nandos where ever I go."}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner. In all name of peri peri by far this had me wowed.   The atmosphere very vibrant and colour, I must say I did enjoy the spaciousness of this location. The art work and music had me feeling like I was somewhere hot on a nice vacation seated patio side while dancers preformed (ovi just an imagination).  The way to order was very unique, it's pretty much self serve, almost fast foodish. The waitress didn't do a great job of explaining but she was still nice and explained herself after the fact.   The food was a good portion and pretty full of flavour. I absolutely loved the garlic mashed potatoes. Not mention the food came out in a very timely manner, the presentation was not so bad either.   I would definitely go here again. Like I said, winner winner chicken dinner"}
{"text":"I used to come to Nando's back when it first opened 8-10 years ago or so. I really liked it then even though it was overpriced. I have recently come back to Nando's and definitely noticed the change in decor (for the better!) and small changes to the menu.   The service is pretty slow but it was also a little busy, so I'm not taking stars off for that reason. The reason for such low rating is the food. The chicken was burnt and the rice was undercooked and tasted very bland. I heard 2 customers at 2 other tables complaining about the rice to the staff. Eek. The portions are tiiiiiny. Seriously, a tiny bowl of fries and even smaller bowl of rice. It's not like the food at Nando's is cheap. It's overpriced for the amount and quality of food you get, just like it was the case 10 years ago. I really think that this place is so busy only because there's not much to choose from at the Heartland Centre, unless you want to go to a nice dinner at the KEG or Milestones.  There are other places with almost exact same menu as Nando's, using the same sauces and spices (you can get them at a grocery store, they're not unique) but their food tastes much better. I suggest you go there instead.  I guess I won't be coming back for another 8-10 years...haha"}
{"text":"Disastrously bad experience. I hadn't tried Nando's before, mostly because there was never convenient, but I am a big fan of peri-peri chicken.  1) The service. The restaurant was staffed by kids. Nobody seemed to care to communicate effectively or to attend to customers. In fact it seemed like employees spent more time talking to a group of friends eating at a table than they did serving. Also eating said friends food and then handling customer food seemed wrong. At least 4 different employees came to visit this table and hang out. Our classic combo (whole chicken, fries, bread; which seems pretty basic) took 56 minutes to arrive from when I paid. Yea we arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday but... yikes. Saw at least one table make a stink and walk out.  2) The food. I really like peri-peri chicken, and this was my biggest disappointment. The chicken, ordered medium spicy, had basically no flavor. They declared it medium when they served it too. It had about as much spice as swiss chalet, and was about as moist as a bad swiss chalet location which is to say fairly dry. Any talk of long marinating or slow roasting doesn't track. This was moderately dry, fairly plain roast chicken. Super disappointing. Thankfully the table sauces are good, but they don't make up for very bland chicken. Maybe this was a mistake? Maybe they ran out of the juicy marinated ones and just said hey they won't notice? I have no idea. It was very mediocre, and not worth the wait.  The real sadness for me was that this location is convenient when I'm spending time in Oakville, and that I love peri-peri. However there is much better peri-peri to be had in the GTA. I may try Nando's again, but not for quite sometime."}
{"text":"Delish fresh chicken. I had hot with red pepper app. Quick service, great look inside. Will come again"}
{"text":"I have been to this Nandos location THREE times by now, and to my surprise, they have consistently upheld their outstandingly poor food standard and their notoriously nightmarish customer service.  On my first visit to this Nandos, there was a huge manager& staff drama going on and the manager was cooking all the chicken on her own. More than 1 hour later we finally received our RAW-style chicken that cost more than $40. I was so foolish to not know they serve complementary Salmonella with their chicken.  Second and third time were equally disappointing; extremely slow service time (average 1 hour wait for food upon ordering), passive-aggressive customer service and either overcooked/under-cooked chicken.Managerial leadership is completely absent in this restaurant, where absolutely no one is taking any initiative with the piling orders. My food was ready to serve on the kitchen counter by minute 30, but they were just left on the counter for another 30 minutes until one of the staff finally cares to serve it (it took them 60 minutes to make me a house salad) Instead of performing their expected services, more than 5 staffs are always chatting in the front counter having a serious gossip meeting with their arms crossed. Watching them chat and laugh throughout the hour-long wait for our raw chicken truly was an exhilarating experience. The staff did not seem to care about their jobs at all and it appeared to me bringing this Nandos down is their only and absolute goal.  There are also many other things wrong with this Nandos location - dirty sticky uncleaned tables and utensils, nasty food, water that will never be served. Worst of all, with all my patience to revisit twice, nothing has improved at all, but worse off in some aspects.  10/10 recommended if you wanna see what's a text-book definition of bad restaurant and incompetent management."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Prices are a bit high, and it's pretty busy for dine in but I like the current management. Never had any quality issues with my food. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Great service. Good was beautifully spiced. Nice atmosphere. Enjoyed the menu options. Loved ordering and paying up front. Allows plenty of time to enjoy the meal and leave when you're ready. Congratulations and well done!!"}
{"text":"My wife is wild about Nando's as she is from southern Africa.  She was so excited about finding this location in North America.  It did not disappoint. It was very consistent with the quality and flavor we experienced in southern Africa."}
{"text":"Try the chicken livers. Extra hot! So GOOD!"}
{"text":"I love this location it's very clean and the staff is super friendly. The layout is nice too they offer certain things that other locations don't. It gets a little on the packed side during peak hours."}
{"text":"I really love nandos. I would recommend to everyone. The pnly thing is they are a little pricey but the food quality is definitely worth the dollar. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and the chicken was cooked just right. The seasoned fries were such a great side we are most of them before we even reached home. Not to mention the store is very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.   I went to Nando's recently with a number of colleagues on my team. This location is a five-minute drive from my workplace.  Previously, I had visited Nando's in Markham. It was okay, but there wasn't anything to write home about. This time, I decided to do the wings. One of my newest colleagues indicated that I should get the peri peri fries. So, I did just that.  I got the wings in lemon and herb. Yum! They were tender, juicy, and flavourful. I will be ordering the wings from this visit forward! The peri peri fries were delicious! It says a lot from a person who is bored of fries.  Since we were a group of seven (no, we aren't painters), we got a table with a number. We then each went up to the counter to place our orders and told the person which table number we were at. The wait wasn't too bad to get our food.  This restaurant is clean. The staff are cheerful and competent.  (130)"}
{"text":"I visited this Nando's location a while back. It was my first time at a Nando's. Luckily, it wasn't busy.  I ordered half a chicken with lemon and herb peri peri. I was then asked what side I wanted. The conversation went as follows:  \"I'll take the corn,\" I said. \"We don't have corn,\" the woman said to me. \"I'd go with the seasonal vegetables then,\" I indicated. \"We don't have that,\" she pointed out. \"What do you have?\" I asked, exasperated.  Basically, any potato side was available. The only side remotely close to a vegetable was the coleslaw. So, I went with it.  I tried paying with an American Express card, but the card reader had trouble processing my card. It made me contemplate cancelling my card, as it tends to be a problem. Instead, I used a MasterCard, which worked just fine!  The server came over to my table with my food and my drink. That was cool.  The chicken was moist and flavourful. The coleslaw was nothing to write home about.   I'd come back here, but I wouldn't hold my breath on getting veggies as a side.  (127)"}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout from Nando's twice now. It's always really busy and usually about a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time.  The food is tasty, chicken is cooked well and we like the options between the differing amounts of heat in the chicken marinade/sauce.  The portions are pretty small for the price. My son had the half chicken dinner with 2 sides and ate it all with no problem (he's not really a big eater). My husband and I each had the quarter chicken (leg) and it was pretty tiny. I don't eat a lot and even I could have used a bit more chicken. The portions of the side dishes are fair, though.  The first time we ordered, my husband had the chicken livers and said they were good, if a tiny bit overcooked.  As I mentioned, we haven't eaten in the dining room, but from what we've seen it looks clean and nicely decorated.   Both times going in for takeout, we've been approached immediately by a server/host, so the service seems to be very efficient and friendly.  All in all, I'd give it a 3-star rating for flavour, but only a 2-star rating for price per portion."}
{"text":"Giving this Portuguese bbq chicken joint a solid 3 stars. The chicken and side dishes here are average at best and arw lacking the wow factor. Prices here are fair but you won't be dreaming about their food a week later.  They work on adding more flavor to their chicken and side dishes here."}
{"text":"Nando's in Canada...wooo hooo! I usually eat Nando's in England but I had to try it here! Quiet intimate location but service was great. Only disadvantage is that the drinks machine is behind the service counter...so if you have paid for a bottomless soda & you happen to be dining at a peak time - you have to wait to be served your drink (unlike other establishments - it's self serve)."}
{"text":"I was really happy when I heard Scarborough finally has a Nandos location once again. Ive been eating at Nandos in Canada since 1991. I ordered the half chicken. When my order arrived for some reason I decided to flip the chicken over. That's when I noticed that the chicken was burnt. I guess the cook decided to hide the fact that the chicken was burnt. I asked to speak to an employee and they apologized and made me a new order. When my new order was finally ready I decided to flip the chicken over once again and noticed that it was burnt also. I was finally able to speak to a manager and he gave me a coupon. When I asked him why my chicken was burnt not just once but twice, he said the cooks do that so that the chicken is not pink on the inside. He said people complain about the chicken not being cooked enough. I found this answer very odd. On a later date I went back to this location to use my coupon and the chicken was extremely small. My food wasn't burnt this time though. Ive been to several Nandos locations around the GTA and also in other countries and this was easily my worst experience. I cant recommend this Nandos location. There are just so many Nandos locations in GTA now that are much better."}
{"text":"As stated in my first review, I'm back for chicken on the bone. I had a 1/4 chicken (Breast and wing) with hot PeriPeri sauce. It was delicious although after the skin us removed, very little sauce remains. But that was easily remedied with a side of extra hot sauce on the side. As I stated - delicious. So why a review of 3/5.  Sides. I had a small salad which consisted of (yes I actually counted) 3 cherry tomatoes, 4 thinly sliced cucumbers and 22 pieces of mixed lettuce. This was priced at $4. I also had a premium side of PeriPeri Beans for $6. It was tasty and delectable but the potion side was in a bowl that would have been better for a side of extra sauce. So I'll admit that taste is not an issue here. But value for portion size will become a determinant decision issue for future visits.   So taste is 4/5. But portion size for sides and cost are a 1/5. I hope a re-evaluation of dishware will occur."}
{"text":"The good: the decor is cute at this location. Large space and open, and tons of sauces for you to choose from.   The bad: The food isn't the greatest. The chicken wasn't anything special...and was quite pricey for what it is. Some of the chicken was burnt and came out to be pretty dry. The fries were also just okay.   Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delivery:  Chicken was great Sides were pretty bland especially the rice  Sweet potato was good Appetizer Hummus came in teeny tiny container.  Portuguese buns were pretty hard."}
{"text":"This was really good! I would have given it a better score but the sangria wasn't the best.   The chicken was moist and flavorful. The spicy fries were to die for. My friend had the veggie burger and said it was top notch. Portions are large so be hungry, prepared to sit, or take leftovers home.   Good food and good times!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for small portions. I small meal will cost you $15, which includes rice and a small chicken leg/thigh. Sure, it's cute inside but not worth the price."}
{"text":"We decided to eat in here. we had half a chicken with wedges, we found the chicken small compared to Swiss chalet. The taste although was very good but we like big plates, we would come again for the good taste"}
{"text":"brutal service and horrible management.  would like to try the chicken some time.  I'll wait till the growing pains are over."}
{"text":"First experience with Portuguese chicken and we will return to Nando's for a second try.  Came here with one other diner. Standing as far back from the ordering counter as possible as we were first-timers and didn't want to block other people who were ready I noticed that we basically were standing at the entryway. The take-out waiting area and the ordering area became a bit cramped when it was busy.  We ordered our two dinners, one 1/4 Chicken (Leg + Thigh) with Lemon & Herb basting sauce plus Nando's Style Sweet Potato, the other 1/2 Chicken with Medium basting sauce plus PERi-PERi Fries. The cashier was pleasant and understanding, she promptly answered the questions that we had since we were Nando's newbies. They position the grill right up front so customers can see that their chicken is indeed, flame grilled.  We appreciated the warmth of all the wood furnishings/finishings as we found a table. There is an eclectic collection of wall art/decor and very large hand painted murals. Seems like they invested a good amount in giving the restaurant a homey feel. The chairs, in particular were very comfortable. The lacquered table tops had that \"sticky\" feeling to them as many over-washed lacquered table tops have.  About five minutes later a server brought us our dinner accessories and beverage. They provide a side plate for bones, napkin wrapped flatware, and some extra napkins. The fountain Coke that we ordered was pretty flat, almost no carbonation. We noted this anticipating a need for carbonation to accompany spicy, grilled food and not getting any.  Another five minutes later the original cashier approached us with the bad news that they were \"all out of chicken.\" For a split second I was filled with dread and disappointment but then she immediately clarified that they were out of dark meat chicken but would sub the white meat option (Breast + Wing) at no extra charge. We were much too hungry to wait the extra 30 minutes she said it would take for them to prepare the dark meat options so we opted for the substitute.  Another 10 minutes later our dinners arrived: - 1/4 Chicken (Breast + Wing) with Medium basting sauce - Not what the original order was at all but still tasted good, well cooked, breast wasn't as dry as expected. Again, too hungry to correct the basting sauce mistake. - Nando's Style Sweet Potato - Decent portion with a good spice and grill flavour, not worth the $4.60 we paid for it though. - 1/2 Chicken (2 x Breast + Wing) with Medium basting sauce - see above description. - PERi PERi fries - They weren't fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot but were good. Spice compliments with potato well.  We will return to try different items on the menu, liked it enough for a return visit despite the misses from our first visit. Hope to up the star rating for the next visit."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this Nando's location.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The ambience and seating arrangements were really Great. Everything, including the food and the service were significantly better than the Brampton and Mississauga locations.  Our server and cashier Christine was so friendly and helpful, and we felt it was the best service we've ever had at nando's.  All of us unanimously agreed that we would definitely drive the extra 30 mins to come to this nandos location.  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"HALAL  For my nephew's bday we ordered food from here and had it delivered. WOW! I love Nando's now! They have stepped up and changed their taste for the better. I remember back in the day when the chicken was just OK and a bit dry. Now, hold on to your taste buds...this ride just got better!   The chicken is cooked thoroughly and the flavors are infused in every inch of the meat. Succulent! The wings, potato wedges, and their garlic bread are exquisite. The charcoal flavor in every bite on top of their flavors just...speechless.   This is going to be my go-to restaurant for Portuguese chicken. If you haven't already, try this place!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this place before it's more of like a cafeteria than a restaurant the way they run their service. You get seated, then look through the menu and wait in line to order at the counter, then food will be brought to your table. Personally I like waiters just taking our orders the old fashioned way. When I went it wasn't too busy, but they were out of dark meat which is what I originally wanted so I got the white meat. The chicken was pretty good and made up for the experience."}
{"text":"We order one classic platters and one whole chicken total of $51.87 for take out!  The place was empty but we still had to waited for 30 min to get our food. When we got home and open it up , my 10 year old said\"mommy they gave you burned chicken \" I have never brought chicken anywhere like this ! I had to throw it in the garbage . This place does not care about their customer or how they serve their food . I will never waste any money or will I ever go back to this location or Nando's again! WORST experience."}
{"text":"Their peri peri spice/sauce is a unique yummy flour. The whole chicken can feed 2+ people. Favourite sides are the spicy rice and fries.   Great place for good chicken and favours, however the dine in feel is similar to a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken is really fresh and flavourful, for grilled chicken. I highly recommend this restaurant. I passed this place so many times and and I'm and I'm glad and I'm glad I came here today. Service was decent, although the drinks took a while to come to the table, the the food made up for it."}
{"text":"I didn't get the rage of nandos. Maybe there was so much hype but I thought the chicken was good but nothing to rave about the restaurant except the ambiance. we got the variety and was super spicy. I did love the garlic bread and fries. It's zabiha halal so we were looking for a great meal but it wasn't meant to be. The red velvet cake is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after driving past Nando's several times in the area. This was my first time here and I heard it wasn't your traditional fast food or full-service restaurant. Basically, you order at the front counter then head to the dining room. You are able to help yourself to the utensils and Nando's sauces in the dining room while you're waiting for your order. The waitresses and cashiers will try to let you know about this if it's your first time and will hand you a Nando's cockerel stick that you place in the little stands on the table.  The dining room was about 3/4 full when I came for lunch. Since it wasn't really fast-food, I was expecting a 15-20 minute wait for my food like other Yelp posters had. Surprisingly, my food came in about 3 minutes! What also surprised me was the price to food ratio you receive. My order came up to about $16 for their quarter chicken, peri peri fries, and a bottle of pop. The whole quarter chicken could actually fit within the size of my hand. Even the 2 pc KFC chicken is about 1.5-2 times the size of what I got. At least the sauce and flavour it somewhat made up for the lack of portion size. The fries on the order hand were OK, as the seasoning powder tasted great but the fries were pretty soft.  While I appreciate the flavour and sauce on the chicken, I would definitely consider purchasing their sauces if they were available rather than eating at the restaurant. It's not considered as a high-end restaurant so their prices are pretty unjustifiable."}
{"text":"EXTRA SPICY Peri Sauce please...  I can see the look in the eyes of the staffs... thinking she is just freaking crazy and doesn't know what she is up for...  Double Leg Chicken with Spicy Fries ($9.49) - hmmmm, juicy dark meat... tender... and SPICY! :)  - I love how they have different level of spiciness... and the spicy has more than spicy, with a hint of sour and garlicky flavour... went well with the flamed grilled chicken - I ended up did not have time to eat in.. so I have it for takeout the wait was about 15 minute for my lunch to be ready to go - Spicy fries was just MEH, too salty not spicy... Skip! Maybe I should go for Spicy rice instead.  What a nice lovely family running this place!! The husband was smiling and winking  at me when he saw me taking photos of the hot sauce! :)"}
{"text":"As in Nando's style, seating here is a bit strange. They either give you the number of your table and you order at the front and they bring the food to you.  Speaking of the food, the portions are tiny. So small. Prices do not justify it. But the food itself is decent. I don't see what the big deal about their peri-peri sauce is. The hottest one is not spicier than siracha."}
{"text":"First time here and hat a disappointment.  The garlic bread was a bun cut in 4 and they charged $4.25.  The Spanish rice was tasteless as was the chicken (I had hot).  Had to ask for the garlic bread which was the appetizer and it showed up half way through the main meal.  Then I had to ask for the olives I had ordered because they had forgotten about it.  Not impressed by the taste also, not sure what the spice was but definitely way too much of it.  There was 4 of us and we all agreed that it was a waste of money.   I will never go there or refer it to any friends.  The only good thing was the person who took my order.  She was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Very good chicken house!! Chicken is tasty, the sauces are good, but they are very spicy. Price is very good as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty overpriced for what you get - decent food and poor service. The waitresses there are the snootiest I've ever seen and this place isn't even close to fine dining. The cesar salad was alright. The baked potato was too hard. The potato wedges were a bit salty but tasted fine after being dipped in their mayo. Medium-spicy kebabs were decent but nothing too special. O"}
{"text":"Like a beacon of chicken-tinged light in the darkness of the Heartland Shopping Centre shines Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken. There a lot of options here and most of them involve chicken, so I hope you like it. Their meals to share come with more-than-enough meat, though I found the small side orders to be too small. If you like spicy food, you will not be disappointed with the peri-peri sauce. On the whole very enjoyable but perhaps a bit expensive.  Obligatory Title Pun: Do you hear the drumsticks NANDO?  Menu Readability: Needs more chili peppers.  Need to mention: Get the kebabs. Do it.  What this place teaches me about myself: There was something in the air that night, the spices right, oh, NANDOOOO."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying that I am that vegetarian girl who went a chicken spot for lunch. I was in the area with two meat eaters and we wanted something quick but with the option to sit down. Enter Nando's with its big sunny patio and, it turns out, a pretty decent selection of vegetarian options.   There is a whole section of the menu dedicated to veg-friendly food (think veggie wraps and halloumi portobello sandwiches), or you can go the build a meal out of apps and salad route. I opted for the later, ordering a side of peri peri spiced fries and a regular sized caesar salad topped with a side of halloumi for $2.   Our food arrived and to be honest I was expecting the salad to be bigger. The \"regular\" is definitely more of a side salad size, which was actually fine for me because I wasn't starving, but be aware of this if you want more food and get the \"Nando's size\" instead. Otherwise everything was tasty, and made even better by various hot sauces and garlic sauce available at the condiment station inside.   Overall, I wasn't blown away by Nando's but I was pleasantly surprised by its offerings and I really liked its big sunny patio. I'd happily return on my next jaunt down Queen West for a snack and a drink."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken skewers with a Nando's side of butternut squash/corn mix with the mango/lime spice level and the flavors were so great! If you can't handle spice DO NOT order that spice level because it was still pretty spicy (coming from someone who doesn't eat spicy food often...ok so my friend who I came with and who eats spicy food regularly confirmed that it's spicy). My problem is that I spent about $23 with tax and tip and only received a fountain drink, what looked like a small side of squash and corn,  and 2 small chicken skewers. NOT HAPPY with that! Service was great and the place was very nice."}
{"text":"Ok for the longest time I wasn't a fan of nandos but when I went in with my fam, I was surprised at the menu change and it was actually good.  My favorite is the grand tabbouleh sandwich because I just love tabbouleh. Thanks for changing my perspective on you Nandos."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Nando due to good recommendation from my friend. So today we agree to try Nando.  The waiter really welcoming us and polite.  He explain to us how they work there  We saw the menu and ready to order our food. After our order arrived and saw the size of our food, we are surprised.  Regular salad, regular potatoes, 1/4 chicken and regular size rice.... The food is small. The food size like tapas restaurant... Small. With the price and size of food,  I'm not sure if we will coming back."}
{"text":"Great flame grilled chicken, with different levels of heat (I usually get medium). I usually order to-go, my one suggestion would be to call in your order before picking up, sometimes the wait can be a little long for take-out.. but it's well worth the wait to get that good chicken. I personally haven't dined in before, but there is the option, and it's always busy! You know what they say, when it's busy, must be good. Definitely a good spot to check if you want that chicken from the grill. This time I got the medium 1/4 chicken with a side Caesar."}
{"text":"There really need to make the option for  0/5 because this place needs it. I decided to stop by yesterday,  I ordered 1/4 chicken (thigh + leg) and some fries. I was shocked how long I waited for my meal. Probably around 20 minutes , only to come home and notice my chicken was burnt to the tar. I was disgusting and inedible, and it was so burnt you could taste it in the meat. The only redeeming quality was the fries, but those were incredible salty. It felt like I was eating a salt block. I would recommend, if you wanted to find another way to waste your money."}
{"text":"I can see why the concept is succeeding. Its real good food. We each got a quarter chicken, which came less than ten minutes after we ordered. The chicken itself is a curious vehicle for a 'Peri Peri' experience, which is not Piri Piri, or African bird's eye chili, but a snappy facsimile. It was apparent the meat had been marinating in a pervasive hot sauce for hours.. days..  Served hot, the bird appeared to be smashed flat with grill marks across its back from where it had been cooked over an open flame. It was well cooked  and covered in their own signature tangy hot sauce. The yellow fried rice was delicious, but I should have got the caesar salad or something green.  The place is clean and newish, and the men's bathroom was clean and smelled fresh and minty. A good experience in Brampton."}
{"text":"This was slightly larger and busier (at lunch time at least) than most Nandos I've been to.  However the staff were awesome and food order was relatively quick.  Drawbacks are no real place to wait for takeout orders, no inviting single seating and the menu never changes. This last point is both a positive and a negative for the chain..  I like the chicken but sometimes I want to try peri peri something else..."}
{"text":"i cant deny the chicken here is pretty good.. however, the size of the chicken is alot smaller than other places.  I had a coupon for this place and ran into some issues, as they dont seem very happy about coupons.  i mean, why participate if you are going to give attitude?  long story short..   - chicken tastes good - portions are way overpriced for what you are getting - wait for the food is on the longer side.. not your typical fast food joint  and all the sauces you get at your table are spicy.. even garlic peri."}
{"text":"This is probably my go-to place for dinner when I can't decide what to eat. This location is usually pretty packed on weekends, so I would recommend calling in for take out. You will be waiting for a table for a while. The staff is quite efficient, my orders are always correct and they make sure the sauces that I order and in the bag. Also do not plan on wearing cute underwear the next day if you eat a lot of hot sauce. Their hot sauce is addicting but you may or may not regret it the next day."}
{"text":"So I came with friends to try something new and I regret it. The line up to order the food took ages and made the entrance very crowded. I ordered the peri peri chicken pita. The food took almost an hours to make which is mind boggling considering the proportions. The pita can be eaten in 5 bites. The fries weren't much. And the coleslaw was really bad. I would've asked to change it but that would've taken another 30 mins."}
{"text":"The fact that this Nando's has been around for quite a while stuns me that :  1. They're still in business 2. People still come here  Came here on a Friday afternoon lunch rush with a couple of coworkers - it was busy, sure, but being located in an industrial area with nothing but businesses, you'd expect this location would know by now how busy a lunch rush would be.  Stood in line for about 10 minutes before placing our order which gave us ample time to decide what to get - lots of options here which was nice. I decided on the quarter chicken with 2 sides (peri peri fries which were highly recommended to me, and mash potatoes). This cost me ~$15 after tax, which seemed fine as I thought I was getting a fairly large meal (I'm picturing Swiss Chalet meals here).   Ok so now here's where this story gets better - I waited a full 50 minutes to get my order! FIVE-ZERO. Standing in there from 12:00 till 12:50, I almost lost my mind and started hallucinating dancing chickens doing the salsa. People seated later than me got their order, ate it, and went home and took a nap. I was near the point of fainting when these angelic Portuguese egg tarts ($2.50) called to me and offered themselves to my belly. My saviour, I'll never forget you oh sweet Natas.  Ok so these egg tarts saved my life and I finally got my order - I was so prepared for this feast and to my disappointment when I opened my boxes, these were ant sized meals! See my photo - the 1/4 chicken itself was $8, like are you serious? I see the breakdown of the $8 including labour fees associated with Nando's personally breeding the chickens, giving them a tender massage, singing them lullabies, before serving it to us. Sure - the chicken was delicious, moist (was told not to say this, so juicy) and I would've loved another, but for the price I was paying??? No way José!   All in all, overpriced good food with a deathly wait time, sorry Nando's."}
{"text":"Nando's in general is a great chain. The staff at this Location are fast and friendly. The kebobs are smaller than those at the Heartland location but they are more generous with their rice portions and they are licensed here. Tough trade-off.  The garlic sauce is simply addictive!"}
{"text":"Having my share of real authentic Portuguese chicken over the years, I walked in here not expecting much. I was in the area and was in the mood for something healthier than McDonalds.   LET ME START BY SAYING THIS PLACE IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL NANDOS IN RICHMOND HILL.   First thing I noticed about this place is the staff. They seem so miserable. I never seem to understand how someone can hate they're job so much, yet still work it everyday? I'd go crazy. But anyways moving along.   The menu. Grossly over priced. It was literally highway robbery for what I received. No wonder the place was empty at 7.   And the wait. Jesus. Took them 15 mins to prepare my meal and I was the only soul in there! (The workers seemed like they didn't have any)   I will avoid this place. I have since tried Los chico's, which is just south of this place. Obliterates this place in regards to price, food quality + experience.    Won't be back."}
{"text":"When it comes to Portuguese chicken, I prefer the flavours brought to you by Toronto's finest little guys, but this patio. This sunny patio beckons, and their garlic piri piri sauce is a beautiful thing.   Common to many English chains, you have to order inside, but they'll bring you your food and check up on you from time to time. My go to order is medium spice quarter chicken and I'm a fan of both of their fries and their spicy rice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite delivery options. Much preferred over Swiss Chalet.  The chicken is consistently great- well cooked, and perfectly basted with sauce. I usually go with Peri-Tamer, but all of them are great, even the spicy ones.The chickens are a bit on the small size, but comparable to a Swiss Chalet.  Sides are hit and miss. Fries always come soggy. Wedges are the better bet. Macho Peas are a nice change of pace. The salads have always been very fresh. Rice is bland and tasteless. Mashed potatoes taste like they come out of a box.   Overall, a good option for delivery, and not too unhealthy either if you watch what you get for your side."}
{"text":"Wow this Nando's rocks.  We have gone here 3 times over 4 years and every time we see the owner, his young son.  The place is very nice, clean but most importantly the food is consistently great.   Not much more to say other than this is your best choice for flavorful chicken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with the family, one of those dinner places that's on rotation. Viewed this restaurant as a \"fast food\" place, since tipping is optional. Got the Full Pack Share Platter, upgraded to Caesar salad for a $1 extra. When ordering water, they will first try to ring up bottled water on the register but just ask for glass water (it's free). If dine-in, the servers will bring plates and silverware which is a nice touch. They will also bring the food on plates when it is ready. Classy touch for a fast food style place.  The servers will bring a variety of sauces and ketchup for the meal. The chicken is always moist (even the breast piece is done well) and cooked very well, with some grill marks. Just enough seasoning and sauce to flavour. Always ask for a little extra dressing on the Caesar salad, tastes better. The meal fed 4 and there was leftover bread and chicken for the next day.  Overall, will definitely be back in the future for some yummy chicken and potato wedges. Don't think this place will be taken off the rotation anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with family at Nandos. Great food, and awesome side options. Enjoyed the rice and wedges. The chicken is juicy, well made. Would come back for their sandwich the next time I visit."}
{"text":"a bit of a funny story before i begin the review, growing up i lived beside a nandos for 13 years. never tried it once!.   my significant other had some nandos brought in for a xmas dinner at her work, and i remembered that this location had been recently opened, so i put it on my \"hit list\"   this location is a bit confusing, we went after done shopping at wal-mart and noticed that i couldn't drive straight into the plaza, so i hooked a right to go to the side street, the only entrance for the side street is for the back receiving and is no way connected with the main parking lot of this establishment. lots of parking, lots of room to sit in the restaurant, very clean and very happy staff.   the atmosphere of this place is pretty awesome, its not very bright, and has alot of darker colors and tones to the restaurant. we were greeted almost instantly and brought to a table, we were told to look at the menu and come up to the order station with our table number. after looking at the menu we went up to the station, and proceeded to order our food, the young lady who entered our order couldn't have been nicer, was very informative and explained a couple of things about the restaurant along the way, as well as the spice chart for the Peri-Peri heat scale. food was ordered with an ETA of 15 minutes. we sat back down after getting some bottles of sauce and our utensils(very smart move on the resturants part to have this station). the food came in about ten minutes and it was utterly delicious. i was very happy with all of the flavors and the levels of heat  that i had ordered. my significant other was also very happy as well. our plates were cleared within a minute of us finishing them, which is always an amazing service to experience.   my only two negatives about this restaurant, which brought it down to four stars, is that, on the dessert menu they have \"Portuguese custard tarts\nata\natash\" listed at $2.50 each...now I'm not an idiot, but normally they should be able a dollar, maybe $1.25 depending on the bakery, to further point in the menu it states, \"A traditional Portuguese custard tart. The name's hard to pronounce, so we call them 'Natas'!\", i find that quote to be a extremely dumb and makes me question why they needed to explain this?  the second thing was that the potatoes were from a box, and not done from scratch, which was still flavorful but disappointing. i also read someone elses comment that the portions are small, i would defiantly agree with that statement, but the flavor and quality is defiantly the wild card in this and makes up for the portion.  defiantly will be back, maybe not for nata's, but for some Peri-peri chicken :)  FULL DISCLOSURE: the extra hot, is pretty spicy, i was very happy with this heat level"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant while visiting Canada with my family. It was very close to our hotel, and customer service was excellent. I also loved their interior. Food was fine, but not amazing. My biggest complaint was that their menu did not have much variety. All of their dishes are pretty basic, and choices are either vegetarian or consist of chicken. I may reconsider visiting this restaurant again, but commend them for providing good customer service and being so friendly even when the restaurant gets busy."}
{"text":"What...on Earth.   I have quite a few British friends and I was always hearing about guys \"going to get a cheeky Nandos, lad.\" I assumed it was pretty good since its \"cheekiness\" was so touted.  While the atmosphere is really rich and beautiful, the food is not. Dry chicken with little to no taste, and this from someone with some seriously white tastebuds. I was so disappointed, I don't plan on ever having a \"cheeky\" Nandos ever again.  But then, what did I expect from people who like blood pudding and something called \"spotted dick?\" ;)"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, and it was very clean, waitresses were very attentive and prompt. I ordered a quarter chicken with salad, mango-lime sauce. My husband ordered the medium spicy chicken with wedge fries with a drink. I found the chicken portions a bit small for $7.95 and it doesn't come with a side either. The marination was quite good and flavourful, nice bbqing, and you can use their peri peri garlic sauce as well which was tasty. The wedge fries were tasty as well, I found the salad good but not really worth the extra $2.95 when usually a chicken meal comes with a side (like in Swiss Chalet). They had a pop machine where you can choose which pop and its flavor as well (cherry Coke, lime Coke etc), and also a yogurt machine if you order that for dessert. Taste was great, but it is more costly than your average fast food joint. Nice service and ambience though."}
