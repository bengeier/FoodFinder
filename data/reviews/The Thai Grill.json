{"text":"Okay the food here is awesome, and would love to eat it all the time but.... they have very odd hours or are just randomly closed. I want to order from there but phone is never answered and if you call both their numbers, their voicemail is always full.  Got take away and it was good an you get quite a bit more at a decent price, but also had a problem with that. I called in and was told forty five mins, but actually took an hour and fortyfive. Not pleased."}
{"text":"AVOID. You know you're in for a bad Thai dinner when the waiters have never heard of tom yum soup. My partner and I ate here last night, thinking an improvement in its reviews might have meant an improvement in the food. WRONG.  The pad thai tasted as though it was drenched in BBQ sauce and the green curry with chicken was bland and watery. The veggies and chicken were rubbery and overcooked, and I don't even want to recall how foul and flavourless the spring rolls were.  This place has a bad reputation among Beach residents, and we now know why.  If you've never had real Thai food before you may enjoy it, but if you have, you'll kick yourself for spending $35 on some of the worst food you've ever had the misfortune of eating. Oh, and like me, you might be sick all night. Truly awful."}
{"text":"We're avid thai food consumers (Golden Thai, Mengrai Thai, Bangkok Garden, Real Thailand, + all the thai in the beach). Just tried Thai Grill for the first time and it was great! We ordered the thai cold rolls, malaysian beef curry and the red curry coconut shrimp. Thai cold rolls were mediocre but the two main dishes were amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The same, or similar menu as Friendly Thais, my girls and I go here for some good enough thai food before heading out on the town. We really just love it because sometimes the drinks are so amazingly cheap that it's worth it for that alone. (not always cheap though, maybe they've changed their menu / schedule?)  Plus, they used to have a sexy photo of a 90's hunk in dungarees on the floor next to the woman's bathroom. It's fun to pose with after a few cheap Thai cocktails."}
{"text":"I've never actually been to this location, but this is our go-to place for Thai delivery.  It always arrives quickly, and hot, and wonderful.  We've tried lots on the menu - the crispy beef is crispy and tangy, the phad thai is wonderful, the green curry is great, so are the spring rolls, the oodles of noodles, and the golden curry is also wonderful.  The lemongrass soup is the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I haven't seen this restaurant in RL, but I ordered delivery tonight and was happy  with it. Arrived in about 39 minutes, no issues with payment, and the food was still hot.  The portions were large - my noodle dish could easily have served two. I had the basil lamb (yummy, but heavy on neither the basil nor the lamb, so I'd skip it next time), the curry Thai noodles (huge, lots of veg, and saucy), and a veggie curry.   Probably not the best Thai you'll ever have, but damn tasty all the same."}
{"text":"For the quality of food and service here, the prices are way too low. The decor is classy and clean, the servers (we were served by a petite woman with a cute, short hair cut - didn't get a chance to get her name) are polite and attentive and knowledgeable, the food - OUTSTANDING. We enjoyed several apps (spring rolls and fried tofu) plus a meat entree and a vegetarian entree. Beautiful blend of spices and chock full of quality vegetables like asparagus and green beans and thick carrot slices. The tofu is cooked right, The meat is not too saucy. They'll adjust the spices to your taste and bring you any sides you need (like rice) to add to your meal. Nice house wine. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I tried a delivery order from here for the first time. Like Jeff M., I had a poor experience. After over an hour, my food still hadn't arrived. Upon calling the restaurant, I kept getting voice mail - which was full. Not a good sign. After 2 hours, I'd pretty much given up but tried calling again. Finally got through, and the man who answered expressed surprise that I hadn't received my order and said he would speak to the delivery guy. About 5 minutes later, no call back (never did get one), but the food arrived. The delivery guy had excuses about ... I can't even remember; I suspect he simply forgot my order. The food, which I was assured was fresh, had obviously been sitting around for a while. It was therefore hard to judge quality. I was given a $10 gift certificate for my \"next order\" - but not sure if I will use it. I would have preferred a discount on that order. I was so hungry I just wanted the food at the time!"}
{"text":"Ok, we wanted thai and delivery so took a shot.  Not a good thing.  Took order and address, delivery guy had to call for location from road (we are right no Bathurst St).  Order arrived, god a chicken dish instead of beef we ordered but was to late to call them.  Food was eatable at best. Hot and sour soup was spicy but tasteless as was rest of the dishes.  Coconut rice was good but what they said would feed two only fed one. think this is a no go again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Loved the Golden Curry Chicken, Coconut Rice, and Samosas. Went during the jazz festival, could here it in the nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Yummy flavours, lots of veggies and just enough spice!   We ordered the Crispy Beef, Chicken & Eggplant, and the Thai Glass Noodles. With a $20 order, you receive free spring rolls and delivery is free. It took about 40 minutes to arrive. Total cost came to just under $40.  Looking forward to dining in, as the restaurant looks really nice inside!"}
{"text":"I really did not want Thai food, however my kids were falling asleep and we all needed to eat. I have to say I was happily surprises by the vegetarian options. We ordered the Thai vegetarian appetizer plate. I thought 13.99 was a little high until the food came. It was a beautiful display of yummy deep-fried tofu, hot/cold spring rolls and green mango salad. There were a variety of veggie tofu stir fries and the avocado peanut stir fry was perfect. I ordered vegetarian oodles of noodles but My son didn't like it, enjoying the pad Thai instead. I thought the place was nicely decorated. The bathrooms were not the greatest however. all in all I was happy we are there."}
{"text":"As a rule, I generally don't eat at restuarants that never has customers in it. None the less, I wanted thai food and I wanted it close as it was cold out. I'm quite confident the Pad Thai has ketchup in it. It's probably some of the worst Pad Thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, and very reasonable prices considering the large portions.  Dined there for the first time last night with 6 friends & I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner last night during the Jazz Festival to catch some of the music. It was already past 9pm and all the restaurants in the area were packed.  It seemed that this was our best option, and the food looked really good. We waited for our table which was to be expected. As well, as the slow service also expected.  We were eating by 9:45-10pm. The first bite of our Ginger Garlic beef set the stage for the rest of the food. Though they were crazy busy and barely able to refill water, the food was undeniably flavorful and delicious. Each dish was packed with vegetables and the sauces were perfect. Not too thick, and not greasy.  We ordered:  Glass noodle with egg, chicken, onion and veg. Amazing  Crabmeat satay skewers: the stirfried veg was so delicious and the crab skewers were grilled and flavorful. Also there were about 6 skewers which was great for $11.95  The Malaysian salad was packed with cooked veg and some glass noodles topped with peanut sauce. It was very healthy but the peanut sauce could have had more kick to it.  Garlic shrimp was also packed with grilled onions/pepers and was soo good.  This experience, although hectic reignited my old LOVE for thai food. Now I'm searching the city for reasonable places more nearby !"}
{"text":"Just stopped by this place.  Food was good but a couple of things threw us off.  1. Prices online do not reflect what they charge - there is a 2-3 dollar difference per item.  2. Mango sticky rice - craptastic -seriously it's mango coloured rice with no mango.  I would have given this place a 4, but -1 for the mango (lack of) rice."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai take-away restaurant. Pad thai is pretty good, and mango salad is decent as well. Delivery guy is always nice too. It's the only thai restaurant that delivers to us on www.just-eat.ca, so that's how we got started. :)"}
