{"text":"Not happy after ordering food numerous times and asking for extra extra sauce they will give you the size of a pill box. I had to use my own sauce from home to my food. Oh well time to explore other place. Gone!"}
{"text":"I love Lily's Pizza! Delicious, authentic Italian pizza for a great price!"}
{"text":"This is a superb family run business. The pizza & pasta are all home made to order. The price is extremely reasonable. The service is fast & friendly  Their pizza puts the big guys to shame"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would - if you like wet soggy pizza where everything falls off as you pick it up then this is the place for you. I tried them when we first moved into the neighbourhood and wasn't impressed enough to give them a second chance however I've had several trades crews through and some have complimented Lily's so I decided to give them another shot. BIG MISTAKE! Even after specifying well done you pick up a slice and all the ingredients slide off into a big pile - THIS IS NOT PIZZA. Unfortunately this meal ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"Way more than what it looks like. Great pizza. Fresh toppings. Great crust. Order the meatballs every time! They are a meal unto themselves!! Love finding these little nooks. Keep up the good work Lily's!"}
