{"text":"Be advised , if the driver does not get the tip he thinks that he deserves (plus delivery ' fee ' )  , he will throw a fit in the hallway of your building. If you call to complain about it you will be told what the average tip is for your building and how you are ' too cheap'. Also if you put your tip on a credit card via their on line ordering and not on the slip in front of the driver , the drivers don't understand that  and think you are giving them nothing, and pitch an even bigger fit.  Dinner and a show!   Thankfully the security guard in my building put a stop to it.   So you tell me folks, is expecting a $10 tip on a $20 food order ( including $2 ' delivery fee ' )  the norm? 50%?"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery here a couple time and the food is pretty good, especially for the prices. I love their sweet and sour chicken. Last time I ordered delivery, there was barely any sauce in my container and I had to wait for the delivery guy to come back which took a looong time. Hopefully that doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"I love this newyork style chinese place. Food is affordable and portions are good. My favorite thing to order is house special lomein and the egg foo young along with some wontons. Only chinese restaurant that has ducksauce eastcoast style. My only problem is i rather pick up than to have delivery. It just seems too much by the time i get my total its always an extra $10 added to my meal. Upon delivery they can never produce a receipt!!!"}
{"text":"Finally found Egg foo young similar to how they cook it back home lln Chicago after being in Vegas and trying mostly every Chinese restaurant here.. It was great!"}
{"text":"They have very good food.  Not greasy at all and the vegetable and meat are very fresh.  Excellent prices and very nice sized portions.  The may serve egg rolls you can buy at Sam's Club but for $1 each they are crispy and delicious.  They deliver and you get your food hot off the stove and delivered super fast.  I have not has a bad meal there yet.  Love the Moo Goo Gai Pan, Orange Chicken, Beef & Broccoli and more!  The hot and sour soup is sooo good!  Keep up the great work.  Thanks for another yummy dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Ok so I went to chopstix express on Decatur been going to this place for years the guy at the counter was very help full and friendly prices  are  not to bad   food is cooked fresh and great tasting. Place is always busy so be prepared to spend some time for good food  you can't rush perfection fast Chinese food is not so great so check them out and see what you think"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Las Vegas!!!! Absolutely the best Crab Rangoon ever! By far the greatest Singapore rice noodles! Their food is a must have in your life don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is either a hit or miss. I ordered the honey walnut shrimp, egg drop soup and some spring rolls. At first I thought that it wasn't going to be good but I was surprised how good it was. I was pleased. The delivery was quick and the guy was really nice. Not to mention my food was still hot when it arrived!"}
{"text":"No it's not a fancy Chinese food but it's always fresh, fast, & tastes great. Plus I love that if you are a regular they remember your orders & being able to drive thru on my way home makes it even better.  I love their Singapore Noodles, the Cashew Chicken, Chicken with Garlic Sauce, Sesame Chicken, and LOVE LOVE LOVE their Hot and Sour soup. Their spring rolls and Egg Rolls are really good as are a lot of the 'appetizer' items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sweet and sour soup here is always on point and huge fan of the cashew chicken"}
{"text":"When ever I'm passing by I always stop in and pick up something I the drive threw. I have always been pleased with the service and the food quality.  It's quick and easy. I will return."}
{"text":"So not only are they rude but demand cash tips even though you pay with your card , which makes no sense,  and cuss you out in their laguage when you dont have cash for tip, plus when you call to complain  they either hang up on you or put their phone on the counter  acting like your not there till you mention  the b.b.b. then continue  to be rude and hang up , tell you they won't  deliver  no more then denies  you all together  . I recommend  you never eat here or ask for delivery  plus if you do you wont get the food you wanted like we did to. Horrible  business  plus horrible customer service  and food!!!!! If i could not rate them i would! !! I recommend  the Asian  place by indoor swap meet by sahara  and  decatur  never fails!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Chopstix express. I randomly found them on Grub Hub and their very fair pricing got me enticed.  First off, I will digress. I learned a lot about Chinese food this weekend. Chopstix is noteworthy for serving \"east coast\" style chinese. I am from the midwest, so I was intrigued. Apparently \"east coast\" style chinese is more Americanized. Its more heavy sauce based/ deep fried based than your average \"west coast\" chinese. I definitely found out after eating at Chopstix that I love east coast chinese food haha. I had always wondered why chinese food in Vegas left me so unsatisfied, and its because they are so different on the two coasts! Who would have thunk?  Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. Everything we ordered was prepared very well and had lots of flavor. The thing we liked most was the value. We got enough food for 3 meals each for about $10 per person. This place is now one of my favorite for chinese in vegas."}
{"text":"Had not ordered in some time. When I had many times a few years back the food and service and delivery were always good. Wanted to treat a friend who was not very familiar with good Chinese food. She ate like there was no tomorrow. I have had the best in Louisiana and in CA and I give this a 5 star because it is as close as it gets to the best I have had. Have tried many, many here in Vegas, and just did not do it for me so laid off for a bit.  Well, this little place came through just as before. Had the Pu Pu plater and everything on it was excellent and large portions. House fried rice huge and excellent. Roast pork egg rolls Suoer. Had the House New York Chop Suey Large portion and again excellent. Very polite on the phone. Delivery was FAST and  HOT.  I am through looking for places that are better. I am sticking with Chopstix Express."}
{"text":"They did not deliver part of my order, I had to call them back. The gentleman that answered asked the chef who said he forgot to make it. No apology, I asked for a discount as the food was ordered for our lunch break and one person therefore didn't have lunch. The man was rude and refused any sort of compensation. Will never order from them again. Which is no loss on my part the food is overly greasy, tasteless and the shrimp were mushy."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese takeout, it's super fast. Like, place the order in your drive way three blocks away and it's waiting on the counter when you walk in kind of fast. So that's definitely a vote in their favor.  As far as the food itself, it's okay. It's not overwhelmingly greasy, and they use a decent amount of vegetables, but the couple of dishes I've tried all seem to be fairly bland and my guy has complained that they're a little stingy with the protein. But at $7 for a lunch combo, that can't possibly be a surprise. Now if only they'd stop using frozen eggrolls."}
{"text":"Yea.. just say no. Very oniony and salty. When sign says no refund, not a good indication."}
{"text":"Ordered a late delivery on the Yelp App almost time to close. Got my order at a reasonable time, Got my whole order with nothing missing.. food was good, my family enjoyed the food for the first time trying and doing take out with Chopstix."}
{"text":"Delivery was super fast. Food was ok. Too much on the shrimp fried . And the  chow mein. I like it my wifey not as much. Orange chicken was kinda mushy. But I would ask for delivery on a short notice for dinner. Not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"sadly this place, while once a gem, is now less than average.  portions are smaller, menue is becoming limited and pick up orders are rarely correct.  tonite i asked for extra mustard with my pickup order and was charged an extra $1.  for mustard?  really?"}
{"text":"My roommate got the Sesame chicken which was just ok, kind of bland, flavorless but she loved the white rice, said it was cooked to perfection. I myself had the House lo mein which so far in the 2 years I have been in Vegas, been the best chinese food I've had, I generally order some type of lo mein no matter where I go. It was cooked to perfection, was sauced n seasoned just right, soy sauce wasn't even needed b/c lo mein can tend to be dry without it sometimes and all the meats in the lo mein were tender and seasoned well. I'll be back"}
{"text":"So it's been a few years since my review and my opinion hasn't changed.  The place has the best NY style Chinese food in town.  The service is friendly enough and the food is really good.  Not much really more to say.  Give this place a chance of you are looking for a good, reasonably priced option for Chinese food."}
{"text":"My friend got the Mongolian beef, decent meat, not to fatty not over cooked and it didn't have the overly sweet and thick sauce, rather a nice teriyaki flavor with a kick and a bunch of onions. The white rice I tried and it was fresh and fluffy.   I order vegetarian egg rolls and choy mien vegetarian. Noodles were cooked just right in an oil sauce that fits Chinese delivery. And the portion is huge with charred lettuce bits and green onions and the egg rolls were fresh but I don't think made in house.  The sweet and sour is run of the mill and hits the spot. Delivery was right on time no need to sign. They also including soy sauce and duck sauce as requested, the air bnb had hot sauce. They are very polite and over all I am very satisfied with my order and the over all amount of food. Such huge portions."}
{"text":"Honey walnut shrimp. I was craving some yesterday, so despite the negative reviews on here, I decided to stop by for lunch. Honey walnut shrimp is $11.95 and comes with a generous amount of shrimp and a side of white rice. The food took about 10 minutes so I know they made it fresh. I really enjoyed my food and I have nothing negative to say about this particular visit."}
{"text":"The General Tso's Chicken was to die for! The fried rice taste like authentic fried rice and the Kung Pao Chicken was very tender but could've used more seasoning. I was impressed and will return soon. Definitely worth trying if you're hungry for Chinese food...their cross streets are Sahara and Decatur here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery!  I ordered the Lunch special of garlic chicken and also orange flavored chicken. It was extremely savory and fresh. The orange chicken was a tad bit salty to me but it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I'd been looking for a $6 lunch combo Chinese place near my job for a while and finally stumbled across this one. One thing I absolutely LOVE is that you can order online. So convenient! You can also choose the level of \"heat\" you'd like in your dish. My coworker and I got shrimp in garlic sauce and Mongolian beef, respectively, both with fried rice. Both entrees were tasty and served in large portions. The rice was nothing special; I wouldn't order it again. The eggroll included in the lunch special was subpar. We also got chicken teriyaki sticks (chicken breast strips on skewers, crispy, not breaded, not too saucy). An order of 6 crab rangoons came free with the meal, which were the biggest I've ever seen and delicious.   All in all, I'd order again, but I'd stay away from the fried rice and skip the eggroll."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place via GrubHub.com, on a recent excursion to Vegas. I was staying at Excalibur. I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and an order of Chicken Wings. Theses chicken wings were &^%$(@# AWESOME. I have seldom had wings this delicious. The lo mein was fairly standard, good. BUT GET THESE WINGS! The only reason I did not give five stars is that it took an hour for me to get my food."}
{"text":"Delivery fee is low, fast and always on time. Food is always good. We always order Kung pow chicken, beef and broccoli, orange chicken and vegetable lo mien. Never had a problem."}
{"text":"Okay...after having trouble finding a good  'fast food' Chinese place we decided to try Chopstix when we got their menu in the mail. The General's chicken was NOT that sickly sweet canned stuff most places use. Theirs is lighter, lightly spicy ( I could use more spice), fresh and hot from the wok.  The rice is good. Wonton soup VERY good.  Egg rolls sadly were the small pre-made and not authentic.But that so far is the only complaint.  Order was correct, delivery right on time and prices are fair.  Will try again soon."}
{"text":"They put way too many medium pieces of onions in the fried rice . it was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it because all i  tasted were onions."}
{"text":"I just can't. This place is disgusting.  I don't know why I do this to myself. But I figured just because I had ONE not so good experience doesn't mean I should ax them out of my food choices.  No. No. and No! This place must drench their food in grease. This time around, I ordered some garlic chicken dish that comes with \"red fried rice.\" The garlic chicken tasted....\"off.\" I can't really make out what the taste was but I definitely did NOT taste garlic. What's odd is that I tasted BAMBOO SHOOTS instead!!! Ummm...what!?!?!?! Why would someone put bamboo shoots in a garlic chicken dish!?!?! Two strong tasting flavors should NOT be mixed like that. And for those of you who know how bamboo shoots smell/taste like would know what I mean. With these nasty little creatures (or tasty, depends on how your taste buds are), you either love em or hate em.  Chopstix, you utterly failed in my book. I don't care if you are less than 5 minutes away from where I live. Even if this was given to me for free, I would NOT eat their food. Stay away from here. I'm sure there are plenty, PLENTY of other \"fake\" chinese fast food restaurants here in town."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. I was totally looking forward to getting some Chinese food the day I ate here. I did a delivery order, and the person who took my order was so very rude. Our food did arrive hot but I don't know about fresh. The food was so bad I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Is it the best Chinese food I've had? No, but it's certainly not the worst. I got the General Tso's chicken for about $7. The chicken was good, there was adequate sauce amount as well as a sweet/spicy mix. The rice, I think, was made with chili powder of some kid because it was a little spicy on its own. Very good combo. I went through the drive-thru and only had to wait about 5 minutes.   Overall it was pretty decent food and it was convenient. If you want a meal for less than $10 that is hot and pretty yummy, Chopstix is a good choice."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  The spare ribs and wonton never disappoint. Tried some soup with sesame chicken and house lo mein. The egg drop soup was very hot and very filling. Family enjoyed the big portions and still had leftovers. The food tastes good, not real spicy, comfort food. Delivery was quick and exact."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. Dishonest, and cheap.      We were hungry and my 7 year old wanted Panda, but I was in the mood for Cashew Chiken and Panda does not have Cashew Chicken. So I search on my iphone for a chineses fast food restaurant. Chopstix Express right across the street pops up.        The first thing I do when I walk in is ask \"Do you have the lunch special still\" to this the guy behind the counter replies no and points me to the combination specials on the menu. So I look at the menu read and ponder what else to get besides cashew chicken. After I ordered I look at the menu again and I noticed the lunch special on the back of the menu, everything I have ordered is $5 cheaper, and that it is daily and ends at 3pm. So I didn't think of it much but that I probably just missed it, oh well!              When I get in the car and started to head home, I looked at the receipt and noticed that the time of order was 2:58pm. So I make a U turn and go back to show him the receipt. When he sees the receipt he says \"oh no the credit card time is wrong, and it printed the wrong time, and that I ordered at 3:02 and not 2:58pm.       I am like wow really!! \"You know as soon as I walked into the store I asked you: do you have the lunch special. To this you lied to me and said no and pointed the combination special on the menu to me. You know that it took me atleast 5 minutes to read and decide what I wanted to order. So you telling me I didn't make it on time! You are dishonest. I will never order from you guys again!       To this he replies If I have to loose your businees than thats ok.!!!  Wow I dont know about you guys, but for a business to lie so that they can earn $5 more from their customers, is just rediculous and wrong in so many ways.  Oh and the food!! Everything tasted the same! The Mangolian beef, the cashew chicken, the chicken low mein tasted exactly the same! As if they cooked everything in the same sauce. And there was too much of that sauce."}
{"text":"Well, the main reason I wanted to try this place was because of its building.  It looks like a 50s style drive-in burger joint (cute tiny building) that is now a Chinese quick eats/take out/delivery restaurant.  The restaurant delivers within a 5 mile radius.  It also boasts using 100% vegetable oil and NO MSG.  The second reason I wanted to try it was because I saw on the sign (driving past it one day) that it served New York style Chinese food.  We called ahead and ordered General Tso's Chicken $6.95 and Chicken w/Broccoli $7.50.  10 minutes later we picked up our food.  The inside was diner-like, a bit rustic and in some need of updating.  There might have been about five small tables to eat-in.  The kitchen where the food is cooked is almost fully exposed so you can watch all of the action take place right in front of you.  Calling your order in at a Chinese restaurant isn't really necessary since everytime you call an order in for Chinese food, don't they always say \"okay, 10 minuss\" (sic, please do not take offense, as I am Asian too--just silly!).    Anyway, we got our food home and dug in.  The portions were very large.  The General Tso's Chicken was \"tasty\" as my source called it yet \"average.\"  My chicken w/broccoli was good but lacked the taste of ginger, garlic, and sugar (the New York part).  However, the broccoli and carrots were fresh and the chicken was all tender white meat.  When our bellies were full, our tins of food still looked full!  I also must add the white rice was perfect and I was told the fried rice was \"good.\"  This comment isn't meant to slight the restaurant but, I don't know if we'll order from here again, as there are WAY TOO MANY Chinese restaurants to try with Chinatown being so close to us!   FYI, this is NOT a late night Chinese eatery, they close @ 10:30 pm seven days a week."}
{"text":"Best chinese food around chinatown area  recommend it a lot! Delivery included as well"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place today. I'm not a Chinese food expert but my delivery was fast the prices were grEat I had two lunch specials and fried dumplings all for 21 with delivery charge. I got the broccoli beef and the sesame chicken which were both really good . Sauce was good and the chicken was crispy. I got my order in 25 minutes. Really great deal will order again."}
{"text":"This was good Chinese food, not great. It says NY Style, and being from NY I'm not sure if that's an accurate claim, but it was still decent. The prices are relatively low and they do offer all-day specials that include fried rice and an eggroll, along with the main entree choice. I've tried the sesame and orange chicken and thought it was good, not like Chinatown in NYC but still worthy of a mention. The chicken is well cooked and seasoned. The fried rice is much better than what I'm used to. It's not all that greasy. The eggroll isn't special, but spring rolls are always the better option anyways. I would consider this to be one of the better Chinese food places I've been to. Not amazing but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I work from home and from time to time I get a craving to leave the house and see what's out there. Today I had to run some errands.   I have been driving past Chopstix express since we moved here one year ago. I used to live in Guangzhou (Canton) in China in the 80s and we had some damn good street food there. I ordered some steamed dumplings, some walnut shrimp, and some ma pu tofu. Well, even before tasting the food I felt like I was back on the streets of Guangzhou listening to the yelling and shouting in Cantonese between the customers and the staff, but this was not fighting yelling this is just normal Cantonese volume. In about eight minutes I had three platters of food very hot and fresh in a bag and I raced on home. The food is delicious and fresh. The place was busy enough because it was well before lunch hour that I came by and people who know their Chinese food or chowing down believe me. This appears to be one of those little hole in the wall places that you don't look twice at but for me now I will return and try some more items as it was pretty good. This is enough food for two adults' dinner, or 3 lunches, and now I have got to share it with my husband."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Regular delivery style Chinese food. Service was fast. Only 3 stars due to the fact that I ordered from a hotel room and it arrived without utensils, napkins, etc. Makes eating difficult."}
{"text":"5 stars for Carry-out! Only 1 star for dining inside.  Young Chinese guy real drab and bored at the counter, he kept clipping his fingernails on top the counter, gave us real cheap flimsy plastic forks that kept breaking off in our mouths, saw 3 flies swarming around, all the employees talk and yell really loud at each other in screeching Chinese very loud and ignorant , good food though for taking home and eating! They don't serve Ice with drinks and don't have any ice....."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Chopstix express a few times.  The food is always fairly good and decent for the price. My one peeve is that every time I order they usually never give enough sweet and sour/plum sauce and hot mustard with their delivery orders. The previous time I got no mustard at all. Tonight I ordered a Pu Pu platter appetizer and a Shrimp Lo Mein dinner. I requested chili sauce for the Lo Mein and extra hot mustard and plum sauced for the large appetizer platter. I got 1 small packet of the plum sauced and no mustard or chili sauce. I never dined inside of the restaurant but don't they usually serve those sauces in a little souffle cup?"}
{"text":"First time ordering from them a couple of days ago and was pretty disappointed. Chicken and broccoli was bit salty. Delivery time was pretty good except for the rudeness of the delivery guy which was quick to ask me if \" I had cash for tip\" Um hello, that's why it was a CREDIT CARD ORDER so I can put the tip on my card? Yes?? Im one of those that don't like carrying cash if you have plastic to swipe just about everywhere. So the guy was upset when I told him I didnt and looked me over and snickered before walking away.  Obviously no education for sure. So will not be ordering from them again. I can get better food and service at China One"}
{"text":"Ummm - no, I don't think I will be returning. I should have read the Yelp reviews before coming in. The food is bland, absolutely not taste whatsoever. I actually asked for it to be spicey and still got no taste. Go figure."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. I ordered their chicken and broccoli and the chicken was super slimy so I called asking if I could get something else and the guy told me no you ordered it you eat it. I'm so happy I spent 35 dollars at this shit hole"}
{"text":"Truly dissapointed!!!  I decided to stop by and grab some dinner on the way home this evening.   BIG MISTAKE!   EXPENSIVE PRICES FOR BAD QUALITY BLAND AND TASTELESS FOOD!   I ordered the garlic chicken which was full of vegetables, very little and few pieces of chicken. This was more like garlic vegetables! The sauce on the chicken was the best part of the dish, just wish there had been a decent amount of the actual \"chicken\" in my \"garlic chicken\" dish!   The crab rangoon appetizer was ok, thankfully as that was all I ended up having for dinner.   I will NOT be back as the prices are outrageous for the poor quality \"food\" they serve.   Most of my meal went to waste after picking out the few small pieces of chicken to eat.   They give a big portion but is not really a big portion as is a small amount of the main course laid on top of a bed of bad rice."}
{"text":"My first time ordering Chinese food,Fast delivery! The food is amazing they even add soup to my order! I was looking for a place with more veggies options on the menu ,and chopstix express is the right place!!! I order for one but 3 can it,Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever very dirty not clean at all! The owner was smoking cigarettes out front when I arrived I should have known to leave. They completely messed up my order instead of fried rice they gave me lomain my general stos was extremely chewy and very sweet. When I called to inform them that my order had been wrong they told me that is why they read back my order and would do nothing at all to fix my order. Never go to this place they will not take care of there customers even when they make a mistake!"}
{"text":"First let me say I will give this place another chance.  Ordered last night.  The food showed up in timely fashion.  Except the forgot my egg rolls.    The seafood special was ok but I wasn't crazy about the sauce.   They eventually came with the egg rolls but they were really greasy looking and I was already full."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt and friendly. However the food wasn't very good. Quite greasy and salty. Least I have it a try."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I ate here for lunch yesterday. It wasn't great, wasn't really good either. But it was okay because we were hungry and we are all broke girls so we ate it anyway.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki bowl. I'm seriously not trying to be stereo-typical here, I'm being dead serious when I say I don't think the chicken was actually chicken. It didn't look like chicken, wrong texture, wrong taste, everything. Dunno what it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't chicken (Maybe pork with the skin still on? Not sure.). The veggies and rice were good. I picked out all the bamboo shoots because I'm just not a fan. The rice was actually really flavorful, almost more like a Jasmine type of rice. it was a little dry when it was freshly cooked, but was still pretty good as leftovers today.  The crab rangoons were absolutely wonderful and the egg rolls were pretty good. Both of these are what kept this from being a 1 star review. The price and portion size is what gave it the 3rd star.  The building is really super cute, with a drive-thru which is convenient.  Customer service was crap. I'm going to just be brutally honest about the lady working. I drove up, she had our order ready already, which was the one good thing. On the phone we had told her we had a coupon for the crab rangoons and she just said, \"I don't care, just show me the coupon when you get here.\" So that's what I did. Well, she got all pissy when I mentioned the coupon and said with a LOT of attitude, \"Why didn't you tell me that before???\" I mean, it was really mean the way she said it. And I tried to nicely tell her we did tell her about it (I even apologized even though I know it wasn't my fault), but she wasn't having it. She was going to be right no matter what, I guess.  I tipped her to try and avoid getting the rangoons spit in (she made them fresh right then). So hopefully there was no bodily fluids anywhere. I guess we will never know. We also did not get any sauce, napkins, or eating utensils.  Anyway, my coworkers got completely different food than I, so I can't speak for them about the taste of their food, other than to say that all 3 of us had bubble guts after eating our food. We spent the next few hours taking turns in the restroom.  And the cherry on top... worst fortunes ever. Like, I'm talking about the kind with sentences that don't even make sense. But the cookies tasted like regular fortune cookies and weren't stale, so that's good.  Not much else I can say about the place. I won't be eating there again, but at least I tried something new!"}
{"text":"Pretty great as far as fast Chinese food goes! The lo mein noodles were incredible-perfect about of sauce and stickiness without being too salty or dry. One star off because the orange chicken wasn't very orange-y, and the crab rangoon didn't have very much of a crab flavor. Otherwise, good portions for a low price, and delivery was WAY fast."}
{"text":"Bomb food. But i ordered broccoli beef with no beef because i do not eat meat, instead we got all beef and no broccoli. Other than that 10/10"}
{"text":"CHOPSTIX EPRESS \"NEW YORK STYLE\", hmmm...  So this is what \"New York Style\" chinese food taste like.  Umm no, not impressed at all, i would say this is the equivalent to CHINA STAR BUFFET.  If this is what New Yorker's are calling chinese food i feel sorry for them.  They are really missing out on some good eats, so sad.  Ok, .so i ordered GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN w/ fried rice and eggroll...never again  - GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN: the chicken in this dish should be so tender that you can cut it w/ a plastic fork. u need a STEAK KNIFE, super tough and chewy. Total buffet style chicken (a CHEAP buffet)  And where was my spice, usually i get a red pepper or two in the dish...nothing. i should of asked for the sarrachi to spice up the meal.  (is that the correct spelling? sar-ra-chi...you know what i'm talking about)  - FRIED RICE: nothing special, bland, flavorless, loaded w/ chunks of brown onion  - EGGROLL: \"Costco's Quality\" frozen eggrolls deep fried to order/  QUANTITY: you get what you pay for, huge portion  QUALITY: WAY overpriced for buffet style chinese food (cheap buffet)...oops i meant NEW YORK style chinese food.  Back in the late 90's in San Diego all the express chinese food places started popping up all over the city.  no restaurant name, all it said on the store front was $0.99 Chinese Food....i've had better quality food at the $0.99 chinese restaurant than this place.  i can't go back, wasted a cheat day on this...that morning run is going to hurt"}
{"text":"This is the only drive-thru place that will make your authentic Chinese food to order within a few minutes.  I like Chopstix because I keep one of their menus in my car's glove box, then place my order while I'm en-route so my food is ready when I arrive.  They are friendly, serve generous portions, and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"What a mistake.soooooo disappointing. I decided to go inside to order & it looks like these people are actually living here. The kids wee running around , their bicycles parked in the corner, the TV blaring something on Cartoon Network and the people in the kitchen just laughing and playing around. I ordered the Beef & Broccoli combo, fried won tons and wor won ton soup. It came pretty quickly but once I got it home and tore into it it was just plain awful, the egg roll tasted like it was made of spoiled cabbage, the beef was thin & slimy very rubbery and I never even tried the broccoli or rice. The Wor Won ton soup was hot but everything was overcooked, the shrimp were tough & rubbery, the pork was missing, and the won tons were not cooked all the way too. The only thing good here was the sweet & sour sauce I dipped my fried won tons into. I would not go back here, Chinese fast-food should not be this bad."}
{"text":"A quick take out place for Chinese food in a former hamburger stand (ie: Eat-A-Burger like in Boyz in da Hood). Service is always quick and they serve New York style Chinese food(Cantonese). Its your typical americanized stuff but thats OK and I'll be back regularly for lunch."}
{"text":"Egg drop soup was pretty good. Crab ragoons were dry and didn't have much flavor. The Moo Goo Gai Pain was extremely salty, almost inedible.  Overall it was a poor meal."}
{"text":"At first, this place seemed like it could be a cool hole-in-the-wall for some quick Chinese. And then, it turned out to be an untrustworthy scam. Long story short, I ordered some food, paid and tipped, exchanged some friendly words with the people working there, sat at one of their uncomfortable tables and ate, took the rest to go, and left. Yet when I checked my statement online, my tip was magically more than double what I wrote down. I tried calling them. They answered at first and then hung up and wouldn't answer again. So I had to call my bank to correct the fraudulent charge. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food and helpful staff.   We are very picky when we order and they almost always get it right.    Today they definitely went above typical.  My husband picked up food and brought it home.  After we ate my three year old wanted a fortune cookie.  As I was opening it,  it flew out of the package.  My dog who was right beside us jumped up and ate it. Oh boy, he had a melt down.  So I caved and drove up there (luckily only five minutes away). I went through the drive thru and told them I wanted to buy fortune cookies. He told me no,  and then smiled while handing me about five of them.  I loved them even more today!    Great food and service!  Love their orange chicken and their  dumplings!"}
{"text":"Fast & Delicious!  Delivered hot and fresh at the speed of lightening!   Ordered: Pork Eggrolls  Pork Fried Rice  Chicken Lo Mein"}
{"text":"Messed up my order I ordered for lunch menu but he charged me for the all day combination price. Me and my co-worker called on the phone twice. The man who picked up kept saying \"omg omg do you know what u want to order!!!\" He hanged up twice for both phone calls.  Dont care about how everybody say the food is good.  if your service is bad. For me your bad. So I give one star. Since I cant give 0 star.   So we went there to tell the man he is rude. He tried to deny it's not him. Smh....  My order total is $12.43 I gave the man $20.   He only gave me $ 2 and some cents. Once I got my food, I asked for the receipt. I told him I gave $20 and the only change ypu gave me is $2 & some change. He tried to cheat me with $5. He said I gave $15. There's no $15 with just one bill. Rude and a cheater.   He also said he is by himself, yea right there's another man behind you. I'm not blind."}
{"text":"Hard to give a direct rating as there was so much good and bad about my order. I ordered the Gen Tso Chicken rice bowl and some rib appetizers. The chicken wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, it seemed like it was made fresh and then sat a while before being heated and stirred up to throw in the bowl. The ribs were a little tough but only barely, and the sauce was more than tasty enough to redeem them. My biggest complaint however, is the absurd amount of soy sauce included when I hate it and did not ask for any..... I order 1 rice bowl item which I can understand some people will use soy sauce for, so I would expect 2-3 soy sauce packets max. Instead, I get 24 packets, and in addition, I get 7 of those small plastic cups with lids full of soy sauce.... WHY!??!? Just putting them off to the side on my desk to get to my food, I notice later that the cups were not closed properly, causing a rather large puddle to form, which leaked down my desk and into my computer which is now dead. A worthless, disgusting sauce that was not asked for, has now cost me a whole new computer...... As much as I want to blame the restaurant, it is typical to just throw a handful of sauce in for the food by default. This time just turned very horribly wrong. F me for ordering Chinese I guess~"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Especially shrimp fried rice and Mongolian beef. Extreme generous portion. I usually order for take out using Yelp and always get my order within 10 mins. Must try!!"}

{"text":"Consistently great food, and fast, fast delivery.  Egg drop soup is sublime and egg foo young savory and delicious every time. I eat their food frequently and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was pretty greasy and kinda bland.....portions are huge though if you're looking for economic prices and large portions."}
{"text":"Attention folks!   Do you like hard, flavorless, uncooked boxed brown rice that taste like it was made weeks prior?   Do you like ordering a chicken dish and it is mostly vegetables?   Yeah! Awesome, then you will love this place then if you answered yes to the following questions!   If half of your taste buds are in operation then please AVOID this atrocity at ALL cost!   The only thing that are ok is their crab Rangoon's, other than that go take a big chunky dump in a bag and dig in, you would love that more than any entree from this place!   Waste of money! Bad Bad Bad food! I feel ripped off! $13 bucks down the drain on garbage!   Don't do it! Please...don't don't do it!"}
