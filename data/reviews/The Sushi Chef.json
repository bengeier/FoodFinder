{"text":"Have eaten at this establishment now at least four times in which it has been a very good experience. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Quality of food is far superior to others in the area. You are not expecting this quality in a small out-of-the-way strip mall.  Tempura was excellent. There are a variety of specialized dishes including UDON and other noodle dishes.  Will continue to return. Pricing is very reasonable. Luncheon specials are available and are reasonably priced as well. It is nice to see a small family establishment that goes out of their way to provide a good eating experience with fresh entrees.   Highly recommended. You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants are hard to come by in Alliston, ON. When I came across The Sushi Chef I haven't looked back. They have an amazing green salad. The crunch noodle soup is something I dream about if it's been to long, and the sushi is on a whole other level. There is AYCE sushi that is good, but A la carte sushi has the quality far beyond anything else. The servers are so polite and treat everyone like they are coming to their house for dinner. I would drive any distance to go here for sushi before settling for another sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise to be sure.  As others have said, the owner is very personable and very attentive to the entire dining experience.  The food wad immaculately presented, very tasty and the dining is comfortable, yet modest.  We'll certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"We were blown away by the excellent service and top quality sushi. The portions are huge, the fish is very fresh and the rice was cooked perfectly. We will definitely be coming back here to try more from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in my small town. Friendly staff and delicious food.  I've dined in and taken out on several occasions. It is typical pricing for an a la care sushi shop. The restaurant is small and much nicer than you would think when driving into this small plaza in the Centre of town in the main strip.  I grew up in the GTA and have eaten ALOT of sushi. Try this place if in the area."}
{"text":"A great place with a lot of potential.  The biggest issue I feel holding this place back is the location.  Beeton.  Yikes but I am confident in saying that this is the best sushi bar around the area.  Not AYCE.  This place has been in Beeton for just under 4 months now and is really just beginning to get a decent clientele.  It is Korean run and the owner goes out of his way to please.  He actually came to check on us more often than our waitress did.  The place is beautifully decorated with hardwood floors, leather chairs, a couple of TVs and Japanese decorations and photos around.  I didn't actually look around and count but the restaurant seats approximately 36 nicely and has a waiting area that seats 9 comfortably.  Because of the location, I doubt parking will ever be an issue but who knows, it could happen.    The service:  Well, the actual waitress wasn't super helpful.  I kind of felt like she was there for her pay check and was doing the bare minimum.  \"Can I start you with drinks?, What will you be having?  Here you go.  You're welcome.  Water? etc.\"  However, as stated above, the owner goes out of his way to make sure you're enjoying your meal, is super friendly and wants to make sure you have a good time there.    The food:  We got the spicy salmon maki, spicy tuna no rice hand roll wrapped in rice paper instead of nori then got the 18 piece sashimi set and finished with green tea Mochi (deep fried ice cream).  Word of warning, it's too much food.  The maki alone was gigantic compared to other sushi joints.  See pictures but the spicy salmon maki (6 pieces) was beautifully plated and was larger than the norm.  The spicy tuna no rice hand roll was also huge and very filling.  That being said I felt the whole thing offered a strange texture and dipping into soy sauce became awkward as the filling slips out (need that rice to give it more structure).  One criticism I felt up to this point in the meal was that the way they prepare the spicy tuna/salmon, it seems they add a bit more panko to the mixture so fish in those orders are a bit smaller in comparison to their larger sizes.  Still, they are delicious and I love that they don't serve these orders with the spicy mayo besides the mayo in the mix.  You really taste the spicy concoction more without the mayo in my opinion. Next the sashimi platter:  Fish is fresh and I would like to attempt to take a stab at which fish is served but I don't know all the names but here goes:  6 salmon, 1 shrimp, 1 snapper, 3 white tuna, 3 pink tuna, 2 of another white fish and 2 of something else that was seared on the outside (white fish).  The platter is served with white radish, a clam shell with a nice design with the pickled ginger, thin sliced carrots all on a banana leaf.  It was overall a nice presentation.   The Mochi icecream:  at this point I was beyond full.  Ice cream tasted fine but the outer batter, well, if you love butter you'll love this.  You can literally taste it and it is just amazing with the ice cream.    Pricing:  My only real criticism are the prices.  Most items are what you expect but sushi pizza $10.95?  What's up with that?  It better be gigantic!  They offer a large list of appetizers, lunch specials, bento boxes, a la carte menu, classic Korean fair (Donkatsu, Kalbi, etc), various wines, sake, a couple Japanese beer brands, house specials and of course sushi.  If you're smart about what you want, you don't have to blow your wallet.  Fore some of the special rolls you may have to pay a couple extra bucks but the sizes are bigger than the norm and the quality is much better than say the other sushi option in New Tecumseth.    No question, I will be back again but this time I want to try some other options to get a more broad view of the menu.  For now, I will highly recommend this place especially for the locals."}
{"text":"My family - 10 of us - came here for dinner. Good quality seafood, freshly made and served in appropriate portions. Attentive staff - we went on a snowy Sunday night when it wasn't too busy. It was my son's birthday and they surprised us with two fairly good sized whole cheesecakes after our meal - they were so rich and creamy!"}
{"text":"I am proud to say we have the best Sushi Restaurant in Beeton!  The first time I went with my daughter she absolutely loved it.  We had the Miso and Won ton Soup, which were delicious.  I'm still learning the menu!  We ordered a variety of dishes; salmon, tuna, veggie and everything was tasty and fresh.  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem out in the sprawling urban jungle that is Beeton. Great sushi, very fresh and well-made. Rolls are big - not the tiny little things you get at some sushi spots. Rainbow Roll was the best one I've ever had. Also really enjoyed the JENN roll and the Diablo was dynamite.   Cost is a little high, especially for some of their specialty rolls, but the quality is there, for sure.   Service is very friendly and polite - always feel welcome when picking up."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I love this sushi joint.   Albeit the cost, the flavour and quality and portions make it all worth it. I've enjoyed the caterpillar roll, dynamite roll, rainbow roll, spicy salmon & sweet potato roll and the crunchy roll. Every single one of them were delicious. I never once regretted spending my hard earned cash on this restaurant. I am stuffed after eating two rolls, legitimately stuffed. They are big and not just filled with rice.   I highly recommend this a la carte eatery."}
{"text":"We went last night after our daughter has been there the night previous. We made reservations which I would say is a must. The place is smaller but very clean. The service was the best I've ever had in a sushi restaurant. The food was exceptional. Definitely tops for me in the area which includes Bradford Newmarket and Barrie. It was my wife's first time for sushi and she can't wait to go back. Everything was excellent. Service, atmosphere, presentation, quality and price. The four of us ate until we couldn't anymore, 5 alcoholic drinks were had and our bill was $110 total. Awesome. If you're in the area this place is a must"}
