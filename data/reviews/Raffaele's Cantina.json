{"text":"Food is fantastic and service is great. Restaurant is always busy and Louie and Raffaele are always friendly. I think the review by Liz below is bias and not very helpful for any new customers. You can't compare italian food to sushi and the prices are comparable  to any restaurant in Bolton or Vaughan.  My suggestion is to go and try it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this nobleton eatery. Particular type of Italian cooking that I enjoy. If you are looking for conventional go with the pizzas. If exploring a bit then wander around the menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Staff and ownership are very friendly.  The food is terrific.  Worth the drive and value for dollar spent is excellent. Whoever is behind the weak reviews is more then likely associated in some shape or form with a competitor........... Give Raffaele's Cantina a shot and make up your own mind. I love it!!!! Martin"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I found a hair in my food. The chef acted as if i put it there. Needless to say i will not be eatting there."}
{"text":"I've heard stories from people who have had a negative experience here. Quite honestly,  although service may not be the best, my boyfriend and I have always been treated well and served adequately.  This restaurant is small, and yes, it's going to get busy quickly due to its size. I'm putting it out there right now - this place has better pasta AND calamari than Ice Cream Patio. I've tried the same pasta dishes at both establishments now (cheese sauce gnocchi ) and the one at Raffaele's blows anything else out of the water! FYI you can tell by the quality of the pasta that it is indeed homemade."}
{"text":"Not only was the service here TERRIBLE, the food was even worse. One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and will not return.   Pros: friendly service, grilled fish was cooked perfectly, salad  Cons: paying $8 for a bottle of water, the crab cakes ($11) are made with only imitation crab meat - that's right, no crab meat in the crab cakes, the sausage, peppers and polenta dish was made with pickled peppers (ie. they cheap out on ingredients as much as possible. Fresh peppers would have made the dish better) and overfilled the dish with a of rosemary. Gnocchi is uneventful.   I would suggest to pickup some Italian dishes at any one of the hot tables at the local Italian bakeries. These dishes are tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. People were friendly and the service was great.   Ordered a pizza which was perfectly done. Espresso afterwards was top notch.   We took a while to order and stayed for some time after we had paid for dinner. In total we were there for two and a half hours and were never rushed or pressured to hurry, which I find too many places do.   Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great salad and mussels. More attention needed to quality of ingredients used. Mushy artichoke - not fresh, water based olives not oil.  Overall, pretty location, but skim on quality served."}
{"text":"Uhm... I've had worst. I'd say this restaurant has been in my hometown maybe 3... years give or take. But I've never been until recently. And I've always heared \" bad \" things but when driving by it's always packed ! So yeah it's not the best. The service is bad. FOOD IS PRICEY. Lunch is a bit cheaper ( obviously ) but it's not the best for ur buck I'd say... drive down the road to Misoya sushi and there you will thank me because that place is my second home lol... also I know the co owner or owner whatever personally and he acts like he doesn't know me just because I'm younger ... I worked somewhere for almost 2 yeArs and he came in everyday .. called me Lisa. My names Elizabeth"}
{"text":"As someone who dines out while entertaining clients typically 3 to 4 nights per week for the last 10 years, I have to say hands down this is in the top 3 for worst dining experiences ever.   The staff and owner are inept when it comes to basic customer service and experience.  One previous reviewer, Christina had mentioned that the staff seat people they know first versus those whom are waiting. While this did not happen to me, I did see this happen to guests that arrived later in the evening.   The food is actually decent;  specifically the pasta, which is a shame as you are forced to suffer with the rude staff and poor service.   I would recommend you take your money elsewhere as there are many other establishments in the area at know how to treat their customers and provide a better value for your money.  If i could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me to dine.  I must say I am not sure where all the negative review are coming from because I have been here almost 10 times and never once have I left unhappy.  I have tried everything from their pastas right down to their awesome pizza.  For all you with a sweet tooth the nutella pizza is a MUST.  For all those with a big appetite try the truffle burger WOW its huge.  By far my favourite thing on the menu has to be the seafood pasta great home made sauce and very generous with the amount of seafood.  I can go on for ever and I'm sure no one wants to hear me go on and on.  I will leave you with this.  If you are in the area or are in the mood for some Italian food check out Raffaele's Cantina.  Make sure to make a reservation  because it can get very busy."}
{"text":"Me and my family had dinner at Raffaele's the day we moved to a nearby town, and we couldn't have picked a better spot. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is warm and friendly, and you really get the feeling that the owners are doing this because they love their craft. Will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Raffs stepped up there game recently, ordered to go a few times this past month and the food has been fantastic!!  Would definitely recommend for a quick bite or to take out.  We tried the polo rose and chicken parmigiana, fantastic."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a rating less them one .... I would .  My husband planned my birthday dinner for March 5th and frankly it was a complete disappointment ..... the steak my father ordered was close to $50 dollars and less than a 1/4 inch thick and more fat than anything else....Extremely expensive and mediocre service ... frankly a poor example of Italian food.  Really don't waste your time and money .  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Will not be returning. I came in on a Thursday night the place was packed. And they were seating people they knew, not people that waiting there first. My mother and I waited for almost an hour for a table and as soon as we sat down the waitress rushed to take our order we didn't even look at there menu yet. I ordered the seafood pasta dish, the seafood was fresh but the sauce was tasteless, it didn't have a seafood flavor at all, it's like there just pored tomato sauce on the pasta and mussels no flavor what so ever. Portions were very small for the price. Not a very good atmosphere we right by the door and the space was very tight. They should have just left tower burger there it was much better"}
