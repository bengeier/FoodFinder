{"text":"Ordered chaple Kabab and kandahar Kabab, the bread was cold and not fresh. A full garlic was in the chaple Kabab. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Tikka and Chicken Kofta Dinner with Qabilee Rice , the plated looked great but a few pieces were burnt on the tikka , the Kofta was extremely salty (do not order) , chutney was very watery, Rice had an uneven distribution of carrots/almonds/raisins. 

Naan was dry and not made in house.

Service was good and friendly. Interior clean and seats comfortable.

Everything BUT the food was spot on. It felt Canadian-ized. 

Would not return"}
{"text":"I've noticed this restaurant as I was driving by and finally got a chance to try it. I ordered the chicken/beef kabob combo plate. I really enjoyed the beef kabob. They were delicious. The chicken kabob was also good,  but  not to die for. I thought the rice was very flavourful. The servive was great. I was chatting with the owner for a few minutes after I finished my meal. He's a very polite man. 
I would definitely come back again to try something else. Good value for your money."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer services and huge portion! I came here with my boyfriend and we ordered Alanoor Kabob dinner and Banjan (Eggplant). The Alanoor kabob was only for $12.99, it came with rice, nana and salad; if you love spicy, go for it, and you won't regret. Besides, the green tea is good, and it was for free. I will definately come back here again."}
{"text":"Was looking for some afghan food with my family and found this place. Got 3 platters for 6 of us and it was plenty. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great place, we decided to tray this place it has recently opened . The food was amazing, customer service was also great our food came out in no time and the servers were really friendly. Portion sizes are also pretty huge specially for the amount you pay! Loved it. I would definitely go back and recommend to try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from them based off the recommendation of my friend who went to eat there once. The food certainly is good and it's provided in large portions, but I ordered on UberEats. When the food arrived, the naan was hard and they didn't give us any of our sauces nor any utensils."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great people. The cashier was so generous and accommodating of my friends and family. He even went out of his way to give my new born some free food to take home for her to eat. Will definitely come back when I'm in the neighbourhood. 

Food I had: 

Beef Chaplee, Tikka Chicken, Kandahar Kabob, Mazari kabob, Chicken Kefta. Vaziri Kabob. Fresh naan bread. Plenty of rice and salad on the side with traditional Afghan Green Tea."}
{"text":"New Afghan kebob place. I am not too impressed. I've tried various Afghan grills in Toronto and Mississauga, and while most are similar, this one is noticeably worse. 

My benchmark for good Afghan meal are the following:
-Freshly baked naan bread
-Rice have a little bit of flavor to them
-Decent kabob portions
-That distinct afghan spice mixture
-Meats are grilled right

This place achieves none of these and even charge a higher price than other places. I'd say the only good part is their salad, which I doubt is the reason you came to an Afghan restaurant. 

I had a chicken thigh + beef combo. The chicken was slightly undercooked. The core parts were a bit raw. I ate the edges and threw out the cores. The rice was flavorless. Most places added some flavor to the rice. Not here. The kebob skewers were small! To top it off, their naan bread is of the supermarket round pita bread variety. I was expecting the oval shaped ones, freshly baked, not the round ones typically used to make a wrap.

Not worth $14 + tax whether you look at quality or quantity. Most places I've tried charge you $11-12 for chicken breast + ground beef. Definitely not considering this place again."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon. We were greeted by a child aged 12 or younger and another child was playing video games in a booth.

My friend got the wrap + drink special and paid cash. They did not have change available and the kid had to leave and come back with change later as we ate.

I got the Alanoor Kabob meal. The chicken tikka was incredibly spicy and drowned out any other flavour that may have been there. The beef tikka was ok. The meal came with a generous portion of rice and salad, but I was disappointed to see that the meal didn't come with any sauce or naan.

My friend's wrap was difficult to eat as the contents were very saucy, but both sides were open and the bread was not pliable. Also, the lettuce in the wrap was completely wilted by the end.

Overall the food ok, but I was turned off by my experience. Besides the issues with our server, there was some religious text playing on the TV which made me a bit uncomfortable. I am respectful of their choice of religion, but it is not really something i want to watch while I eat.

I will get uber eats from here in the future if I crave the food, otherwise I will not return."}
{"text":"This place had a very bad swarma. There was very little chicken and it was super salty. Nice guy but food wasn't good"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. It was the only thing I ate that day and the rest of the day I felt nauseus and wanted to throw up. Food sat in my stomach and wouldn't digest just like previous times I had food poisoning. 

Reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the food TASTED fine; got the spicy beef kofta kabob and the grilled chicken with salad and naan. Also got a side of fries and a mango milkshake. I didn't finish all of it since I was planning to save it for later but those plans changed after realizing it made me sick lol. So the food tastes okay, the prices are decent and it's free delivery on Just Eat. Just be wary because it may make you feel unwell."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service, awesome food, awesome people. Do yourself a favour and check this restaurant out you won't regreat it."}
{"text":"My favorit Aghan kabob. I love it. Very beautiful place and good food. I would definitely recommend this place to every 1. They give big quantity."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Uber eats, absolutely horrible food and worst experience. Was very disappointed in the false advertising, I didn't receive what I ordered( I ordered a beef and chicken combo, only got chicken, and no sauce) and what I did get was rotten. I will never order from this restaurant again. Their tasteless naan bread was stale as well. When I called to complain, the person working there says it was impossible that I got rotten food, worst customer service. This place won't stay in business for very long if they maintain their horrible customer service, and serve their customers rotten food, stale food."}
{"text":"Had their palow and eggplant. Not thrilled with either.  The qabilee palow had no taste.  In fact I saw them re-heat my order in a microwave before selling it to me.  I was disappointed that it wasn't fresh.
I had better like Bombay kebab."}
{"text":"Place just opened up and the food is fantastic so far!!! I recommend the Chicken Tikka Kabob. 

Go for Combo 3!! You won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"Finally an Afghani kebab joint opened up nearby.   Came across this place as I was driving by looking for a decent meal.  The staff greeted me right as I walked in.  It didn't feel like the usual small quick grab and go kebab places I have been to in the past.  The dining room is very well layer out all seating is booth style.  Very nice atmosphere almost like a upscale eatery with the gas fireplace and dark grey tiled walls. 

Okay on to the real reason I frequent this joint.  They offer the usual kebab fare nothing usual or confusing on the menu.  I'm mostly a chicken lover but on occasion will mix it up.   So I ordered the mixed plate filet mignon with tikka chicken served with rice, salad, and bread.  Talk about a heavy meal!  Definitely a great place to go after a hard workout.  Both meats were very juicy and cooked just right.  The overall result was a food coma. 

I'm glad this place opened up near me and looking forward to  trying their other offerings."}
{"text":"Came in to the restaurant on a Tuesday evening with my family. We were the only ones in the restaurant. The decor is cute, very clean. We ordered and we had to pick up the food ourselves from the counter. We had to ask for extra utensils and plates and cups. No serves that came by to see if we needed anything. We didn't mind but if you are expecting to be served this is not the place for you. Food was amazing! Meat was tender and juicy. Rice was flavorful and the bread was very nice. We really enjoyed all of the food.. and the two places was sufficient for 4 of us.. with tip it came out to $40. Now that I look back there was no real need to add a tip but we paid before receiving the food. I would defiantly come back here. I would have probably given it 5 stars if they brought the food to the table and given plates and utensils etc"}
{"text":"Chicken was burnt and small portion compared to other places and it was not fresh at all. I wouldn't come back to this place again. Much better Afghan places. Elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday with my boyfriend. Had the All Noor special combo. It was amazing. Loved the kebob chicken and the beef was so flavourful. The rice was a tad bit flavourful for me but went great with the meal, the salad was perfect! The bread was good and the two dips. The lovely girl at the counter was very talkative and very nice. I would love to go back some times, the d√©cor was amazing! 

However, my visit was ruin mid meal by a guy who walked in to used the washroom... He was rude to server when he asked to used the washroom, did not order anything. He came over to my table as told me he was hungry and ask me for my food.... And in a matter of fact tone of voice. I was so shocked. Being the only two customers there and fmthe fact this man cornered me in my seat I really couldn't say or do anything. He was crazy, I mean why would I give you my 1/2 eat food and plus, how low do u gotta steep. The brilliant thing was the girl at the counter came to save me and my  boyfriend as we sat there awkwardly in awe of what this old white man had just said.(Hey, I said it, he was old, white and a man, all the f**king privilege in this country is for his type yet, he is doing this and being rude.  And there are racist people complaining about Asians and other people being rude and let me tell you we never do this shit.)  Anyhow, that b lovely girl saved us and responded with can I help you sir, and that f**king old man bolted, he ran out said no, I have no money and left. I mean seriously old white man, if u don't got money ask politely to use the washroom and leave, why u gotta corner people, it felt like I was being held at gun point and asked for all my cash... I mean why the f*\"k do u gotta stand so close(were were blocked in cuz this guy was also big(or fat)). Anyhow, bless that girl. And she was so apologic about the whole thing and keep apologizing. I didn't mind it wasn't her fault, she didn't know if the man could've been a rude customer and no one but that old geezer knew that this was gonna happen. All in all this place has great food and staff. But just beware of the rude hobo like white old men that randomly come about, cuz these people who work here are too nice. Additionally, I feel that Scarborough has really gone downhill, it's worse than downtown, it's alot easier for a begger or fraud charity money begger to walk into a suburb restaurant than one downtown and there seems too be alot more of them these days. 

Ok... So this review is 1/2 rant, but I loved this place despite all that happened. They are also opened very late :) a bonus for night owls, but I dunno next time I gotta find a come back one someone demands I give them my food... Being robbed for food.... A low point for anyone, the robber and the ones being robbed. Thank God for good servers. :)"}
