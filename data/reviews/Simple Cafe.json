{"text":"From the simple exterior to the welcoming and inviting atmosphere and service, to the clean, fresh flavours of the homemade yummies, eating at Simple Cafe is an experience.  To quote my companion on my trip to the cafe today, \"Racquel is HOT!  That's right, she is mine!\" On a more realistic note, another patron present this afternoon enjoyed his roast beef sandwich and shared with us that the reason he returned after only discovering this place yesterday was because of the service.  He also described the orange chocolate pound cake he sampled yesterday as an \"immaculate confection\". Do allow me to confirm that yes, the tables are completely natural.  The heavenly pink swirls of the Manitoba Red Maple. This is now about my 5th visit here and I finally wanted to share this place with more than just the friends I bring with me. The most important thing when you are considering your choices and looking at the prices is that this is not some frozen, reheated corner quick stop coffee shop.  It's a pleasant cafe, with some of the most welcoming and engaging people you will ever meet.  It's a wonderful choice for a fast but healthy meal to either sit and relax (and use their wifi as we're doing right now) or grab and go.  You will want to return just to try more from the eclectic menu.   If you spend a few minutes to sit and enjoy what they offer you will leave sated and even a little uplifted."}
{"text":"From across Queen Street I spotted Simple Cafe and it quietly called out to me. I think it was the empty table bathed in sunlight near the window that lured me in and once inside I admired the clean white space and raw feeling of the wood tables. The selection of bottled juices further endeared me to Simple Cafe and I chose a French berry lemonade.   But while the white bench was comfy, the table top was lopsided and the entire thing teetered constantly. And the wifi was unstable and at some point stopped connecting all together.  In short, Simple Cafe's a fine spot to read a book or chat to a friend but don't come here trying to get work done on a laptop."}
{"text":"you walk in here feeling like youve just walked on the set for a cottonelle toilet paper commerical.  everything here is white.  white as snow. white as doves. white and pure as the concept of having everything you serve be organic.  the tables are not white per se, but about as white as one is able to get a thick slab of hacked off wood which serves as the top for all the tables in there.  theyre really quite lovely with supposedly natural whirls of noticeable pink colour appearing as heavenly accent.  the chairs too are white and comfy.  the space is divided into about three rooms. the first room has its chairs and tables hugging the unobstructed window in front.  the second room lies beyond the first one which houses all the food and cafe items.  that space, when i was there, was dark and lit by a candle with one other table beside wall that sat beneath a curved staircase that led upstairs to an area not for customers.  the back room was where the food was prepared, though not while you waited, but beforehand.  i ordered a cappuccino and it was tasty no doubt.  it was served in an eco friendly cup and cap.  i tried to decide whether to get something to eat this time around;  for sandwiches, they serve just what they say they will. simple stuff.  you can build a sandwich for a mere 3 bucks of chicken, ham, roast beef or veggie with some lettuce and stuff i suppose.   they didnt have organic bread on to serve it on when i was there but were in the process of setting up a deal with a bakery to make the concept complete.    if i didnt want a sandwich i could get a salad which started at 4 bucks with one extra item beyond the lettuce, and increased by a dollar i believe for each extra item.  there were also prepared items which looked more interesting like macaroni and cheese, mini hamburgers (2 per order), scones filled with stuff (she mentioned raisins so i stopped paying attention), a sweet potato salad, some quesadillas and a moussaka i think.  the deal with those was six bucks for one (which i think is a bit much depending on the one you choose - two dinky hamburgers i could finish together in one bite is not worth six bucks alone, organic or not), but eight bucks for two choices and ten bucks for three.  so you are encouraged to get more and then it becomes worth it.  after all that deliberating i didnt get anything else, because i stopped short of getting the combo of the burgers and the macaroni when she said theyd be warmed up in the microwave.  it kind of defeats the purpose of organic i say.  supposedly there was problems with food being burned in their oven...it was temperamental.  hmmm.  i will be back here again.  im sure there prepared food changes, maybe theyll get that oven issue worked out and for a cheap and healthier sandwich option its great.  plus its not so often that i get to feel pure and fresh anymore."}
