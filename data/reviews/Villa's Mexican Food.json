{"text":"It has been months since I have eaten at this place. I used to eat here often, especially on Taco Tuesday. I walked in today just knowing I was going to have another great experience so I took my order to go. There was only one young lady (I could see behind the counter)  who was quite pleasant and pointed out the new menu items which were of Indian origin (like Chicken Tandoori, Curry Chicken etc). I thanked her for the info and told her that maybe I would try it next time. So, I ordered tacos (hard) with shredded chicken on the inside. It took no time for my order to come up. It took me less than 5 min to get to my destination and BOY was I disappointed. The taco shells were cold (why? not sure). Then I broke apart my shells and discovered my chicken was ice cold as well.  I was so sad because I enjoy a good taco.  Every element of my taco was cold, as if everything came out of the fridge.  If this place has been sold to someone else then they need to just do the Indian food and forget about the mexican food. I wont be returning unless I want Indian food. The lady said she makes that fresh per order."}
{"text":"I was hoping we would have a great local restaurant in Villia's, we were wrong.  They got our order wrong, the booths were dirty, which din't make sense because they were empty.  When we did get our right order, there was little flavor or spice.  We will keep making the drive to Los taquitos when we want good street tacos."}
{"text":"Good Bean and Cheese burrito, also love the red salsa."}
{"text":"I've been to Villas four times since it opened.  Since its right across the street from my house, I really wanted to like it.  I was excited to see a Mexican place opening so close other than El Gran Taquito.   Every time I've gone there, service has been slow.   Two times we have gone and a part of our order has been forgotten.  Today I went and ordered a single item, a bean burrito, and they didn't even START making it for 25 minutes (the window allows you to see them cooking).  For what is supposed to be convenience food, the service is just not there.  The food is average, but after factoring in the wait time, I don't think I'll go back.  I've had fairly good luck with Vaquero's (southern and 19th Ave), although it is a bit further from Laveen."}
{"text":"I woke up craving a good old homemade breakfast burrito with sausage, eggs, potatoes and cheese. Even though it was a little past breakfast time, the ladies at Villa hooked it up!!! My prayers were answered and now I am happy as can be. Thanks Kara!  My new quickie go to place when I need something that feels like mi Casa."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to great fresh and tasty food. Not anymore,the last two times the food was on the verge of being spoiled. It isn't fresh made anymore, its heated premade food from the microwave. I had the marinated pork tacos, which is one of my favorites,this time the meat was rancid. When notified the man behind the counter just shrugged and said sorry.So after two bad experiences,we have had it, no more Villa's for us, and I would not recommend it for anyone else."}
{"text":"Texan here! Stopped by this joint recently craving some Mexican. I was not disappointed!  The food was cheap, delicious, and came out quickly. In fact, I think I'm going to stop by today!   There will always be nay-sayers. To whom I say: Don't expect top quality atmosphere and service for such low prices!"}
{"text":"The food was great at first but the last two times I ordered bean and cheese burritos they were cold...so cold the cheese was not melted. I do hope they correct this soon."}
{"text":"I have tried this three times, trying to give them time to learn and improve since this is a new business. Well, we tried a couple different items each time we went......and well it hasn't been very impressive. It seems that they use a microwave to reheat their pre cooked food. We have tried the Carne Asada a couple times and it was dry and tough, as if you microwaved a piece of steak. The one time that they had chicken, it was ok. The fresh chips that we ordered were greasy and it even leaked through the brown paper bag. I think we visited this place for the last time. Hope it gets better!"}
{"text":"just got there 99cent tacos man they suck meat had no taste and very blend meat was cold bearly even stuffed.. don't eat here very often and now i wonder why!! yucckkk"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new place to eat in Laveen, but this place didn't deliver.  The first time I had the taco & beef burrito plate... taco was decent but the burro was woof.  I gave the place a second try and ordered the supreme burrito...  double woof!  It was smothered with a store bought type enchilada sauce.  YUCK!  Anyways, I've learned my lesson and II'll stick to the other FEW good places around...  i.e.  Duners, Starbucks...  ah I think that's it."}
{"text":"Tasy Mexican food with that home-made, fresh out of Grandma's kitchen appeal. It's too bad there are so few choices of restaurants on the Laveen Baseline Corridor---but this is a nice, new addition. It has a small seating area, and I only wish it were a larger restaurant!"}
{"text":"Even though you have a couple of different Mexican food places near by, they're no where near as authentic as Villas.   Great service.  Great food."}
{"text":"Villa's, i'm not sure what the hell happened, I use to enjoy your food, it use to be clean, and you use to actually have a value. well not anymore. sadly I went in for some thrifty ice cream today. for what ever reason thrifty has the bast mint chip to me, i wanted 3 scoops, what I god was a pathetic excuse for 1 maybe 1.5 scoops if you stretched it. I don't know whats going on here but it needs to change its getting ran into the ground. not sure if its a management problem or owner problem but i'm not coming back."}
{"text":"We eat here almost every weekend and the food is awesome!! service is great definitely a plus in my book. blows filibertos away if you can even compare the two."}
{"text":"Portions are large. Prices are low. The green sauce is okay...I wish that I could say the same for the red. I probably need to try something besides the breakfast burritos before I say anything else. It's no Carolinas, but I'm sure I'll go back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is a gem - had a few burritos from there and can't wait to try other things.  I had the California Carne Asada burro yesterday - it was GREAT!  My honey usually gets the mixed burro with chicken, which is super too.  Cheap, big portions, friendly service.  It's going to be one of our go-to places if we don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"The employee was very nice and helped me with my order. However the place was gross I ordered my food n by the time I actually got it I was so disgusted with the place on how gross it was they had roaches in the plastic spoons and forks! And they were out of almost everything I paid about $13 on a Assad burrito and rice and bean with a large soda was I walked out of the place the food n soda went into the garbage! Can not believe I just wasted this much on something and not be happy. Couldn't tell you how good the food is cuz I couldn't get myself to even try to put it in my car. I will never go back there! I hope they get inspected soon cuz if they pass then we have some bigger problems in this city cuz I never ate at a place as gross as this place was."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is always average but so convenient that we have frequented this place on a weekly basis since they opened.   Well, last night we went and it was a little bit busy - 5-6 orders before us. I ordered a simple order of two kids meals (bean burro and quesadilla) and a red chili plate. It was to be \"for here\". The time on my receipt is 7:07pm.   Finally, my 4 year old asked if we were ever going to eat, I looked at the time and it was 7:44. I went and asked about our food. They had no idea, no food ticket, nothing. Two of the girls argued over who lost the ticket. Finally they reprinted my ticket. I had to wait for two other people to get their food before, finally at 7:56 receiving my food - TO GO. I told them it was supposed to be for here. The girl looks at the ticket all confused. I told her nevermind, grabbed our food and headed home. We live 3 minutes from the shop.  We got home, opened our COLD food and ate!   I called this morning to give them a chance to make this right and Dehlia, the manager, told me she would have to talk to \"her girls\" to see what happened. She never took my phone number to call me back or anything. She could not care less about this.  With three other mexican restaurants in the same shopping center, I suggest Villas starts caring about their customer service."}
{"text":"I am torn with Villa's because they really do try. The beans are awesome but to cheesy. My family and I tried many dishes including the diablo shrimp which was rather tasty but wayyyy to spicy. But, hey the name warns you. The Mexican hot dog was a nice treat after trying it in California, never seen this anywhere else. They have whats called a California burrito which was really tasty a mixture of carne asada, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo, yummy, right? Just too greasy. The breakfast burritos would be perfect if they weren't so greasy, may be because the overload of cheese, next time I'll ask for less. The taquitos are always good way better than Vaqueros. We will continue to go."}
{"text":"Yeah...I think we are finally done with this place. Got a taco that had meat in it that was literally dried and completely hardened like it had been sitting out for days or something. I'm not sure how ignorant you have to be to serve that to someone, but I don't want to eat food prepared by someone who would think that's OK ever again.   The inconsistency is ridiculous. There isn't much choice in this area of Phoenix unfortunately, but they just got crossed off my list forever."}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I visited Villa's this morning and had a very negative experience. - We waited an hour (55 minutes) for our food (for 5 people) - A two-burrito order was lost and had to be re-ordered - Many people complained that they have been waiting for over 30 minutes. - The burritos we had were soggy for some reason - The carnitas plate had strips of very tough meat  Conclusion: Either don't go to Villa's during normal peak hours, or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service. Taco Tuesday is awesome and I you are ever super hungry try the Carne Asada fries. So much you can't finish it. Its great to see this place flourish with Filibertos next door. I would choose Villa's everyday over Fili."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The portion size are huge and the prices are low. I love their carne asada burritos and breakfast burritos mmmm good. The people that work their are super nice and service is fast. The only thing I don't like is the place it self is small so I don't like to eat in, I always get it to go."}
{"text":"We have been to the week-old Villa's twice now, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The space is cozy, with about 7 booths, and a colorfully painted wall with a tiled opening where you order and then another where you pick up your food. All of the employees have been very friendly and willing to chat and answer questions. The chef/owner, Rene, told us that he had worked 130 hours in the first week, cooking from 6 am to 10 pm, but that all of the early positive feedback made it worthwhile. We didn't get a chance to meet his wife, Angelica, but she was the one who had contacted me via Yelp messaging weeks ago, inviting me to come in and give them a try (as I had been complaining of the woeful Laveen restaurant scene) and also kept interest piqued on Facebook. Very smart use of free social networking sites, I'd say.   On to the food: my husband tried a carne asada burrito, California style, and declared it one of the best burritos he's had in the valley. It had carne, cheese, fresh pico, and potatoes in a large fresh flour tortilla. I had a bite, and it was indeed scrumptious. I asked for a combination of the carnitas and carne platters, because I wanted to try both meats, and they were cheerfully accommodating. Both meats were tender, but I found the carne to be much more flavorful. I have become used to the style of carnitas at Garcia's Las Avenidas,which is cooked in more spices. I also prefer the refried beans from Garcia's, but Villa's were pretty good. The pico both looked and tasted super fresh, and the rice was very moist and flavorful with some bits of fresh corn, peas, and tomato scattered throughout. For breakfast two days later, we each had a breakfast burrito, most of which have eggs, potato, and cheese, with some type of meat. I had it with bacon, but my husband, who tries to eat vegetarian as often as he can stand it, had it meatless. He found he missed the meat, especially after he grabbed my burrito and took a few healthy chomps out of it. The burritos were very good sized- I couldn't finish mine, and Bob was quite full after his (and the rest of mine). It's the kind of breakfast that will keep you going all morning.   We are thrilled that Villa's has lived up to its promises of great, fresh, all in-house made Mexican cuisine, and we will return often to work our way through the menu. Finally, Laveen, we have a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"What happened! I haven't been here in a year or so.  I saw a coupon on restaurant.com, so I decided to revisit. There were no Mexicans in the kitchen, but I decided to give the Indian guy the benefit of the doubt (hoping that maybe somebody taught him well). I paid for my order using a credit card.  He handled my money with the same gloved hands that he used to make someone's order. I got my card back with enchilada sauce on it.  I observed him as he made my order. Nothing went on the grill. Everything was put in the microwave. I was scared to eat my burrito because the people sitting at the table behind me barely ate their food.  They left with plates that were darn near full of food...looked like dry shredded beef tacos (that was a sign). The potatoes in my breakfast burrito had the skin on them, which made the burrito gritty, and it was bland. I was so hungry when I got there, and it just messed up everything for me. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I've ate many times at TaCarbon and this place is pretty darn the same. Tacos are made on a grill inside the resturant and of course with carbon ;) You can deffinitly taste the difference and taste the freshness. The people here are a bit quite but very nice workers in deed. Price is good not bad at all and if you complain about it then go across the parking lot and grab ur self 2 tacos with fake meat for a buck and jack in the box lol."}
{"text":"Another great meal.  Machaca breakfast burrito's chips & Guac. Had to wait a bit but well worth it."}
{"text":"It's Friday. I went in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered 2 shredded beef tacos and 1 fish taco. While I was waiting for my order I look down in disgust. This place is infested with cockroaches. I completely lost my appetite. I did mention this to employees. They said they'd let the manager know. Ewwww, I want to give them 0 stars"}
{"text":"Food is great the service SUCKS!! 20 minutes for a breakfast burrito?? This happens ALL the time. The owners obviously have no idea how to properly staff this place. They have one guy taking orders and cooking. I'm never coming back. Ill be going to Filibertos on 51st and the 10 from now on.  If the owners want their business to not fail they better fix this. I facebooked about this and got 80 likes in 30 minutes. I also posted on 6 other sites letting people know not to come to this place."}
{"text":"This my favorite place to eat authentic mexican food. The workers are polite & friendly. The atmosphere is neighborhood friendly. I always  tell my friends about this place. Villa's Mexican Food is what makes Laveen an awesome place to live & eat."}
{"text":"I go to villas all the time this place has great food and is very cheap. You should for sure come here to get some quality grub!"}
{"text":"For you Yelper's looking for reviews-- sort by DATE. You'll notice all the negative reviews for the most part are recent, this place is not what it once was!  This place is under new management. I'm not sure when it happened (probably within 2 months or so) but this place USED to be a staple that I would go with the wife at least once a month. In our little area, it was our favorite Mexican place. Always very fresh and fast and incredibly low prices.  Since it's been bought out we've gone twice but refuse to go again. I'm not sure the circumstances, but the (owner) is this nice enough Indian guy but what he's done with the restaurant is bizarre. They now serve Indian food (which they were COMPLETELY out of Sunday when I asked to try) the quality has gone down massively, night and day and when I went today (final straw) he was the only one working the kitchen; there were two other tables waiting for their food when I ordered and it took about 45 minutes for my food to come.  I got a shredded chicken burrito with cheese & potatoes. The chicken had a nice helping of bones/cartilage and was insanely dry, the potatoes still had skin on them making it very gritty and everything just tasted old. (not even sure if it was safe to eat) He also forgot my cheese. Considering a Filibertos is literally right next to it, this guy is done. When your a restaurant and your food is much worse than a fast food joint, you're doing it wrong.  It almost seemed like the store was just bought out by someone who really has no place/interest in running a Mexican restaurant and is trying to integrate Indian food or even switch it to an Indian restaurant in a very bizarre fashion. Beyond slow, WAY worse quality and massively under staffed. I really wish I knew the circumstances of why it was bought out. Possibly the previous owner's were ready to sell and this Indian guy saw an opportunity but really has NO place running a Mexican restaurant; shame.  Edit: Whelp, looks liked they closed. Complete shame but good riddance. They were taken over and ruined the restaurant."}
{"text":"Now I come every weekend... Love this burrito. I don't even have to order it anymore because the staff knows what I want and how I like it . There is another restaurant similar next door with a drive thru and I still come here. Yummm!"}
{"text":"I really, really like Villa's.  The service is friendly, the food is good, and they are local with reasonable prices.  The bean and cheese burrito is my favorite, and the machaca & carne asada burritos are pretty tasty, too.   They could be faster, but I call ahead  a few minutes & my order is usually ready."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays for $0.99!  This place had good tacos for $.99 that are full sized, not the usually scrawny little tacos on special.   The staff were friendly too.  A good spot to grab a bit for lunch!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos!!! Such good food, their Lengua Taco's are the BOMB!"}
{"text":"I keep hearing good reviews for this place, so I tried it again.  This time we had chili rellenos again and nachos.  The chilis were larger than last time we were there, so that was an improvement  The service was definitely better.  The nacho plate was large and looked nice, but tasted AWFUL.  The meat was very tough, it seemed overcooked or possibly reheated.  I did not feel well after.  I wanted to like this place, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant location used to be El Mas Sabroso. Sadly, El Mas Sabroso is permanently closed. This is the new Mexican joint there now.  They cleaned it up a bit and redecorated/remodeled. Kinda like Filiberto's, but nicer and more modern inside. I think they were going for the Chipotle's look. Their food is good and the pricing is about the same. Carnitas was really dry which is odd. Rice is outstanding.  Like Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless."}
{"text":"we had the chicken enchilada plate, chicken torta, and rolled tacos.  very tasty and fresh, but chile and salsa were not hot.  cant wait to try their spicier dishes!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars, I honestly would. The new management (not Mexican) was sweet but tried to persuade us to purchase from his new menu, Indian food. He did not have carne asana, ice , tea or Lemonade. While we were eating he attempted to fix the ice machine and the a man stepped onto the counter, where he keeps utensils straws and lids, with no shoes or socks on.  If you want Mexican food, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"We're having trouble deciding whether we like El Gran Tacquito or Villa's better.....  They're literally right across the parking lot from each other, they offer somewhat similar menus, and I thought I heard that the owners were related.  But they also seem different.  My son and I have tried Villa's twice now, having taken my wife on the last visit, and have tried the following:  Beans (in burrito and as a side) -- decent beans and cheese, as well as a tasty red salsa on the side that goes well with them.  Chips -- freshly fried tortilla chips are the best and for some reason rare in these smaller Mexican restaurants.  Villa's has them.  Guacamole -- quite good, actually; a nice balance of the lime, cilantro, onions/garlic in a creamy avocado base.  Highly recommended.  Chicken Burrito -- also quite good.  My wife thinks this one definitely beats the place across the parking lot.  I think I agree.  Carnitas Burrito -- This is what I ordered on my last visit, and I thought it was excellent.  The pork tasted like it had been slow roasted, a little dry and fatty, but just about right.  And the tortilla, as always, is quite tasty.  Villa's, though, needs a little help with the ambience.  The walls are mostly bare and the sun comes glaring straight through the windows at dinner time.  Only half of each plastic bench/table combo is actually functional when trying to avoid the harsh sunlight.  Otherwise, I'd say that the owners have done a great job in this tiny little space.  But seriously, this is the second Mexican food place to open in Laveen and not offer cervezas on the menu.  I hope the next one to open (I'm sure there will be more) sees this opportunity.  One more note: I did not appreciate being bombarded on Yelp by the owner's messages announcing that Villa's was opening soon.  Also, my first attempt to visit -- after receiving a coupon on my Fry's receipt -- was a failure, as they hadn't yet opened.  Perhaps the owners could work a little harder on future marketing efforts."}
{"text":"I originally gave my review five stars because i confused it with the Mexican restaurant down the road.  The place that i wrote the review on is actually somthing I would never recommend. This place is no good what so ever. Very very very dirty"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. Had the chile verde several times and the menudo on saturday and sunday is really good.  Love this place for take out, they do have eat in as well."}
{"text":"I really Try to be fair, and most of the time I give businesses the benefit of the doubt I do not like to be unfair to anybody, but  This place was not good at all,  It was dirty first of all. that is not good I ordered a burrito and 2 tacos It took about 20 minutes to get my order, there were not that many customer in the place. I finally received my order and I realized that the order must have been ready a while back and it sat there getting cold.  When I finally received the meal. it was packed in such a way that the tacos spilled all over the box, the tortillas and meat was cold.   The burrito, was cold as well and not very well made.  Every single order, should be high quality,   I will not go back"}
