{"text":"Sweet little place! Great burgers!! Live music. Sorry to hear they are moving to a new location. Loved the little house!
Second trip--crab \"burger\" was like a blob of crab salad on a bun. Not real tasty for me. Husband tried the crab and shrimp stuffed portobello- 2 1/2 stars out of 5, he said. It was thickly covered with melted cheese, a (less than) subtle touch it could be much better without. He said the asparagus was good. The service was good, and they did comp my meal, which was nice of them. In the future we will stick to the burgers!! Live music was very pleasant. Beers good."}
{"text":"Great service, food, & atmosphere. In an historic house so tables are in various rooms so quaint and great acoustics for private conversations. Tina was perfectly attentive and had great beer suggestions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brew 515 is a great new spot offering sandwiches (only available before 5pm), a variety of salads, flat bread pizzas, burgers and several heartier dinner options.  I love that guests have several side salad options and that Brew offers a large selection of reasonably priced craft beers! The restaurant itself  is inside of a very large historical home. They have kept the walls and the space is divided but it has a very lovely result! A fun and intimate bar area, 2 seperate patios, a small cafe style dining room and intimate family style rooms upstairs for larger parties! Our group of 6 got a room all to ourselves which was wonderful with our kids! I do have to say though that the kids menu is limited. We got by with cheese pizza and salad for the kiddos.
If you go to Brew make sure you look around. Go out back and check  out the cornhole and picnic tables! I promise you will find a spot that's  right for you!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, food was good, and beer selection was great. The bldg is very unique. Great spot. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service in North Carolina.

Ive eaten inside once and ordered to go three times. So I've given these people a shot or two to not be completely incompetent when it comes to human interaction. All three times it felt like I was being waited on by someone from another country. And I mean that literally because It really felt like the waiter was traveling back and forth from another country from how long it took. The first time I went to this place I stood at the hostess podium for ten minutes and at some point, a lady from another table shouted over the live music to tell me that's the kind of service that they got too.

The food is fine. It's bar food. So for the people raving about that: Please travel outside of Kannapolis for lunch one day--you will be amazed.
But again, the worst part of this place is the fact that you will wait ten to twenty minutes just to even pay for the food that they most likely didn't take a correct order of the first time around. To test this out, ask for a side of ranch dressing with your food. It won't happen. Because each time I asked for it, they forgot it and I had to remind them. This time I forgot to remind them before I left, and of course, there's no ranch in my box.

I know it's tempting to go eat at the only place in Kannapolis that doesn't look like an opium din but I would honestly just take my money over to the concord side of 29 before even driving by this disappointment again."}
{"text":"This has been a go-to place for us.  Sadly the last 4 or 5 times we have gone for dinner it has been very disappointing.  Cold artichoke dip the last 3 times we have gone.  Service has become increasingly questionable.  The food quality just is not what it was 8 Mos to a year ago.  I know that the owner is trying to do the right things....it just seems that things are slipping.  We want the best for Brew...we sincerely hope things get back on track......there are too many other choices out there."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. There was a fly in my salad and the potato soup had no salt. I will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been here several times as Old Stone Vino, excellent beer selection great food, and the atmosphere is laid back.  Great place to sit and enjoy good company good beer and great food.  We can not wait until the weather warms for the outdoor music!"}
{"text":"Place is very cool looking inside. Lots of beer options. However, I have been here a half a dozen times and service is horrible. Don't expect an empty glass to be filled anytime soon, unless you are someone who likes to bark orders across the bar. If you like servers that walk right by and ignore you this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing tap selection. Constantly rotating choices. Nice salads on the menu. Tasty wraps and sandwiches. Pork rinds are fried up fresh and served hot!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, the owner is a Racist and was yelling at me over some pecans that was on my salad. She was arguing with me and told me we can leave. So longer story short I will never recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"We love this slightly hidden gem, we go here in the summer for date night twice a month and we sit out on the patio to enjoy live music, a very good beer selection, wine as well and we always have the special of the day. Inside is nice as well they always have a good crowd! We ate here for lunch with our three year old and they were very accommodating to a smaller size dish. Great place and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday night. GREAT PLACE. Awesome eclectic beer menu covering everyone's taste, wine, and full bar for those that want it. 

Food was great I had the Buffalo Bacon Burger, my wife had the Crab Cake Burger. Wait staff was on point,  helpful with questions and quick with conversation.  

This is what I love in a joint.... Good beer, good food, good atmosphere and even somewhere I can bring the family. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Nice concept.  About 20 micro brews on tap and a few more in bottles and cans. 

Awesome atmosphere.  Old wooden house with front & side porch seating. In addition bar, front room and upstairs tables for dining and drinking.

Has live music  a few times a week.

Nice selection of Burgers,  sandwiches, entrees, and appetizers. 

I really wanted to give a higher rating but food could've been better. It's a fairly new establishment so perhaps some growing pains. 

I will try again.  Some hints: Get pepper mills, offer grated cheese for pasta dishes,  also smaller buns or bigger  patties for burgers.

Had the artichoke dip, southwestern chowder , and a spinach salad with walnuts blue cheese vinergerette dressing,buffalo burger and shrimp scampi. Dip and Pasta dish needed just a pinch of salt and definitely pepper for our tastes."}
{"text":"This place is surely a diamond in the rough.  I think I had the best salad I've ever had there, today.  Spinach salad with chicken, strawberry, goat cheese and avocado.  Yum!  I thought it would be more of a bar, but it's definitely worth going if for only the food."}
{"text":"Very unique old house turned restaurant in a cute little town. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. My husband and I were sat in an upstairs room, all to ourselves. The atmosphere was warm and light jazz was playing. We ordered the Poutine (Poo-teen), which was fries smothered in brown gravy and mozzarella. Very good! We shared a Hawaiian Hamburger with Tomato Basil soup. The burger was well done and on the thin side. It was nothing to write home about. I did not like the soup, but my husband ate most of it. It was cream based with heavy Basil. I am picky when it comes to tomato soup. Sodas come in a can. They will charge you an extra 4% for using your credit card, so pay with a debit or pay cash. We would probably try it again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and parents on a Saturday night, since this place is right around the corner from their house and came highly recommended.  

We were seated upstairs in a semi-private room that was open to other areas and the hallway, but had only one table.  The service was quick and very friendly, and the beer selection was very good - lots of N.C. stuff that's hard to find elsewhere.  I had the pimiento cheese burger, and it was great - the burger was flame-broiled, and the bun was soft and really good.  The prices are also very reasonable, as even most of the higher-end \"entrees\" weren't more than $20.

I was a big fan of this place, and we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch - we were pleasantly surprised that they offered the full lunch menu as well. 

For appetizers we ordered the fried pickles (yum!) and the spinach and artichoke dip served with pita chips. The dip was interesting ... The cheese combination 
Is a little strange, but you still go back for another dip...we did not finish it so that should say something. 

Our friend ordered the crab cake  Benedict and he loved it. 

I ordered a black bean sandwich with fries.  It was a black bean sandwich.

My husband had the Troy Built burger and it was very good. 

The best part of this restaurant are the multiple beer selection."}
{"text":"This place was Old Stone Vino now B.R.E.W. Better beer selection than before. Nice homey feel. Great outdoor area. Live music."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to hang out and have a good beer. Tried the TroyBuilt burger (bacon, cheese, peanut butter) which would be better if it wasn't beyond well done.  Have had their flatbread pizzas before which are awesome. All in all a fun a place to hang out."}
{"text":"Waited a half hour for drinks and they weren't even busy. Worst service I've ever seen. If I could give a lower rating I would."}
{"text":"Great food and super craft beer selection. Specials every night. Only place in the area that has growlers other than Lowes. Tina the owner is friendly and super busy. The only thing I'd fix is you usually have to wait a while to be seated. Not that it's crowded , they just take a while to see you. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best place to have a craft beer and excellent food. Very nice staff, and talkative even to new people. This place is a diamond in the rough of terrible Kannapolis bars."}
{"text":"Hmm, not sure where to start.  Was greeted by a \"host\" who clearly implied sitting up stairs not a good idea. Sat outside, drinks came quick, then we sat for 20 min.  Waitress pushed us off on a kid from back. Seems she was overwhelmed, to many large tables. Guess we were not a big table so not interested. 2 orders of fish & chips they only have one.  So she's shows up after we order with random Cesar salads. Yeah, no one orders a Cesar salad. We watched 2 tables sat, order, eat & leave. Food ok mostly warm. Had to find manager she did right thing covered dinner. Just go here for a beer, skip the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, I've had beers here that I haven't seen at the Saucer or TMac, which is saying a lot. Very respectable tap list and a nice little bottle rack for retail, which isnt nearly as stocked as Lil Roberts, but between the taps, top level pub food and environment, this place has Roberts beat. 

Come in for Lunch for awesome specials, try to get here on burger night but good luck, what a deal though, and make sure you come in thirsty!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I cannot lie the food is above and beyond expectations. The burgers are some of the absolute best I have ever had. Salads are amazing and beer is great. 

Beyond that, the service is horrific. I love the food but hate the service."}
{"text":"One last negative experience that would likely prevent me from taking the 25 minute drive again, but after three times, still believe it is a cute spot.

Won't hammer with a one star... Beer selections are very good, bar food is pretty good. I just won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good crowd, good beer selection and awesome specials all wrapped up in a cozy atmosphere with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place was an amazing find...well more like a recommendation from a friend.  This place has plenty of seating indoor and outdoors.  When I visited it wasn't too busy so we were sat right away.  The beer selection is good if you are into craft breweries. We ordered the shrimp and crab dip which came with a good helping of dip.  It was lacking in the pita for the dip but we just ordered extra.  Both my hubby and I ordered burgers.  I thought the burger topping selections were decent.  I had a pimento, tomato, lettuce and bacon burger and it tasted good.  I thought it was cool that you had the options of fries or fried pork skins.  I went with the fries which were your typical fries you can expect to get."}
{"text":"Recently we moved back to the Kannapolis area. Our love of craft beer and good food brought us to BREW via a night out with local friends. We were pleasantly surprised to find BREW 515 so conveniently located. Corey and Charlotte provide an outstanding level of customer service not only to us but to the entire bar/restaurant. Corey's ability to choose a beer based on your taste in on point. Don't be afraid to give BREW a try."}
{"text":"The food is ok but I feel a bit over priced for what it is. They have a great deal on Thursdays. Good selection of craft beer.  Love the location.  The chocolate cake is the best!"}
{"text":"This USED  to be my favorite restuarant. The service was a little slow but I overlooked that because the food was good. That was all true until tonight. We took some friends and family for the low country boil. 2 of the 5 people with us ordered it for dinner. They were brought out a silver take out container with few muscles, shrimp tails, 5 or 6 small shrimp, one piece of corn, 2 potatoes and crawfish claws. When they asked to order more, they were informed they didn't have any. So they proceeded to order shrimp cocktail. One order had 3 shrimp and the other had 4 shrimp and again this was all they had left. Remind you, this was all you can eat for $20 pp. One of the people in our party ordered a burger since there clearly wasn't enough food to fill someone up who ordered the seafood. I ordered the shrimp and pasta. The shrimp, which were mixed in with the pasta still had tails on them, there wasn't any sauce on the pasta, I asked the server to bring some out, I was handed a cold bowl of a white sauce with white chunks, that had no flavor. It was not dible. When the checks arrived we were charged full price for the burger and the seafood. When we asked to speak to a manager about the charges no one would come to the table, we proceeded inside. and were told the seafood would be taken off the bill. The server then came back to the table and said were would be charged the entire price. Never ever did a manager or owner come to the table. This poor server was used as a good between, which left her in tears. We kept reassuring her that it wasn't her fault. clearly the owner of the establishment didn't care about her employee or customers. We were also told that we shouldn't come back if we were going to treat the employees badly, LOL Our server was tipped VERY well. And if complaining about the food was treating employees badly, there is no way I'd ever return here to eat!!!!"}
