{"text":"After at least 5 disappointing tries - we've finally written off this place for good. The awful food would be somewhat tolerable if the service even remotely made up for it.  Sadly, it does not. The painfully long wait times for service and seemingly dissinterested staff make this place unbearable!  Hopefully, their 15 minutes is almost up and a decent restaurant will take it's place. Such a shameful waste of prime patio space!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere! The bartenders are amazing! The wait staff is great. I like the lunch and brunch menus best! The lobster bisque soup is great!  It's opened 24 hours which is awesome... It has the best cocktails in this side of town!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The decor is beautiful and the outdoor patio is perfection. I had the ahi tuna tacos and curry skewer chicken. Both great! Good service and laid back atmosphere. Also, fresh flowers at the tables! A bonus! It doesn't feel like you are in a mall!"}
{"text":"The singer-guitarist played \"Wonderwall\" twice in half an hour during brunch. Enough said."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience of my life! We had such high hopes, that crashed and burned like this review will. On a Saturday night, the place was d-e-a-d DEAD! Not a good sign & the first of many red flags. we actually wanted to eat next-door at their sister bar due and proper, I had seen an advertisement in a magazine offering buy one cocktail get a cocktail free. Second red flag, now I know why they have to offer a bogo deal. The service and the management here suck! Due and proper kicked us over to 'whist' as they don't seat children under 21 in the bar. Our party kindly rolls with the punch and heads over to Whist.  Third red flag, the entrance/hostess station was not clearly noticeable. We entered in through the deck, wandering around until the hostess finally acknowledged us and sat us.   There was one huge party on the deck, and we shared a server with that huge party. After we sat order drinks, another party larger than our sits next to us. They get their drinks and appetizers in due time. It takes our party of four people 30 minutes to get two Gin and tonic's and one beer. But first it took our server 20 minutes to inform us that they were out of Hendrix, or Tanqueray, which they didn't carry! We realize we had been sitting for an hour and 15 minutes before we had had enough. Voracious, Defeated, and humiliated we wandered ourselves not too far to Me Gusta Tacos  where we were treated Properly. Served delicious food, with a friendly smile and a laugh, all in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Whist for light bites and cocktails once or twice over the past few months and always enjoyed our time there.  We had not yet had a proper dinner there however and were eager to do so.  After finishing our meal there last night I can genuinely say that it was really exceptional and highly recommended.    We began with a seafood hot pot consisting of a generous portion of clams, mussels, shrimp and crab.  My wife and I shared the dish and loved it from the presentation down to the mini fingerling potatoes and thinly sliced corn on the cob.  My only recommendation would be to serve it with some sourdough as the broth was fit to stand on its own! Excellent start.   For entrees my wife had a penne dish served with roasted chicken.  Simple and expertly done.  The roasted tomato sauce (not quite a vodka sauce) was exceptional and the chicken incredibly moist and well portioned.  Again great presentation.   I ordered the lobster fettuccine and was extremely impressed (particularly considering that it was really well priced at $21).  An abundance of lobster and hearty flavorful sauce held well by the fresh pasta.  It'll be difficult NOT to order both of those dishes again when we return.    Overall, an excellent dining experience in Henderson (right in the heart of the District).  Really a welcome addition to the dining options on the side of town that generally has more chain restaurants than anything else.  Great ambiance, terrific food, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch and sat on the patio.  Love that they have umbrellas for shade. Finally a place in Henderson that makes everything from scratch and has a truly inspired menu.  We had the french toast and the crabby in the morning bennie and both were fabulous.  We added the bottomless mimosa for only 18 bucks which was awesome. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was disappointed. 25 min later still no drink. I ordered cider from menu but server said that it's a miss print on menu. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter for a special girls night dinner.  Won't forget it.  Food and drink we very good.  Will definitely come back when in area."}
{"text":"2 stars for service, 4 for food.  This place has a wonderful atmosphere, is decorated beautifully and presents everything so interestingly. My sister and I came in on a Thursday around 12:30, on a slow afternoon, and were sat outside by the hostess. It then took about 15 minutes for our server to even come to our table, after I had to walk back inside and ask if we would be helped anytime soon. The hostess responded as if she had forgotten we were out there, and I emphasize how slow the place was when we arrived, there were 2 tables inside and we were the only ones outside. Another 5 minutes later our server came out and offered us drinks and if we wanted an appetizer. After finally getting our drinks (I got the Rosemary's Baby and my sister got one with ginger beer, I forget the name, which were both absolutely wonderful) we placed our order for the deviled egg appetizer. That came out quickly and was sooo delicious. I ordered the Tuna Burger and my sister got the salmon salad. It took about 20 minutes for our lunch to arrive, though we ordered at the same time as appetizer. The salad was tasty, a perfect blend of flavors which complimented the salmon nicely, except the salmon itself did taste a bit fishy and not fresh. The burger was a bit disappointing, as I'm a huge lover of good tuna. My server mentioned it's served not cooked all the way through, which with an ahi steak is ideal in my book. It came out fully cooked and rather dry. The toppings on the burger however were very good and fresh. Overall the food was good and I would return for that and the cocktails alone.   Service needs huge HUGE improvement here. Not one employee seemed aware of their customers needs. The bartender saw us waiting to be served, said nothing. The hostess was on her phone and seemed like she had better places to be. The waitress was not attentive to simple things and did not check back with us once during our meal; just to take our plates and offer a few last words before we were given the check. It's disappointing to say I dislike this restaurant based on service, but if I ever return here it certainly will not be for that aspect."}
{"text":"Warning: stay away especially if you use post mates.  The menus are not correct. So pricing and ruining will be off. Also they run out of stuff constantly. Which is a pain with postmates because you have to contest how much you owe. Plus pricing is off.  Friday 12am - 3am means that exactly at this place. Do not over think that. Just don't go past literal hours expecting good results.   Bartender point blank is mean, putting it nicely. I seen him tell a guy who didn't know the difference between beers point blank Google it, wiki it. I don't know about you; but I don't pay for rudeness.  If you assume management over a place, don't be lazy. Change the menu to address how you want your business ran. Food may be good but restaurants are two dozen a dime. Never stand for being disrespected for your dollar."}
{"text":"Our New Year's Resolution: to try new things, especially resturants.  This place hit the spot!  Great food, great drinks and great decor. The bartender created a special drink based on my flavor likes/ dislikes (thanks Trey) and the food was so perfect!  The beet/endive salad was perfect as was the bass and yardbird.  Service was perfect too.  We'll be back...to try different menu items to stay with our Resolution!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised the Sunday brunch had a build your own Bloody Mary Bar! The biscuits are made in-house and are unbelievable!! The brunch menu had a nice selection.  The staff was friendly, especially the manager Rob, who stopped by our table and told us all about their menu.   The live music really added to the ambiance. Whist will have the NFL Sunday ticket so plan to get there early when football starts."}
{"text":"This is the best lunch with the best bottomless drinks!!! You can choose mimosa, belini, sangria or, my personal favorite, build your own bloody mary. The food is delicious! Brittney is the best waitress ever!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great ambiance and delicious food. Skirt steak and the Salmon were spot on, and beautifully plated. Truffle tots are an excellent side. Gentleman's Quarters, do it. Highly recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! I've been really spoiled by the San Diego food scene since I was there the last couple of years, so it's nice to find places that aren't large chains here in Vegas.  The atmosphere was pretty cool during Sunday brunch they had a live band playing. The whole thing reminded me of something I would find in San Diego, didn't really feel like a typical Vegas place.  The food - they have a lot of creative options so that was a plus. Some of the appetizers we got were nice, watermelon and feta, donut holes, and pizza flatbread. I ordered the breakfast chilaquiles as my main dish. I'm gonna be suuuuuuuuuuper honest. It was kind of salty. :/ I'm just not a big fan of salt so maybe it would've been good for someone else. But I did totally enjoy it otherwise. Bottomless mimosas were great and well made. Only thing that would've made it better would have been quicker service. They were pretty busy so I get it but I still like my drinks refilled promptly.  I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place! That atmosphere is so beautifully done and very vintage! Food and drinks are outstanding! Try the Aunt Ruby Red Slippers. Brunch was so good:) The chef and manager checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything was okay. Great service. Will return!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. I had the Oxtail tacos which came in 3 in an order and it was really tender and flavorful. I had The Refresh cocktail and it was very aromatic and not too sweet. The cocktail was vodka, elderberry, and lavender. Also tried the skewers appetizer and was just the right size starter. It had shrimp, lamb, beef and chicken and a sauce that matched each protein. Pit server (I think her name wad Cheryl) was so attentive and had good recommendations.  It's right next to Due Proper, but their signage was kinda hard to see. Right across from Kings Fish House of that helps. Highly recommend this place for good eats and casual, but upscale feel."}
{"text":"The food was as good as the service is atrocious.  We've been waiting over an hour for our food and the server's continual promises that the food is on its way are as empty as our stomachs."}
{"text":"Service is terrible and unfriendly. Food is mediocre at best - I had a breakfast burrito and I could have gotten a better one at a drive-thru.   Owner sat next to us and called us \"rude\" out loud for watching a two minute video on YouTube at the table, despite him talking at an unreasonably high octave during our meal.   Total douchebag and we will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"We had brunch here and we loved it. The food was great, the bottomless mimosas were wonderful, and the staff was amazing. We will definitely return here and I recommend anyone to give them a try."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered food, was given the wrong entrée, and subsequently got food poisoning."}
{"text":"I have been to whist 4 times in the past month because I work in the area. First time was amazing. I went on July 3 and too my friend who was visiting from Switzerland. They were impressed with the food, atmosphere and how wonderful the waiter was. The next two times were average. The waiter was just don't the bare minimum but was staying professional. Tonight however, we terrible. Again I took a friend who had never been before. The waitress was an early 20 year old girl with black curly hair and skirt so short it would only be appropriate in a club. Every time she would see how were were doing she would present a half assed smile and then scowl and roll her eyes before fully turning her back to us! Her attitude was completely inappropriate and juvenile and I will make sure to not being any new friends here since the quality of service can be so poor."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my family and friends.  Always great service, great drinks, food menu is great and that they do change it seasonally.  Super hip, modern, contemporary and prices are completely justifiable.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place was better than a 3, but not quite a 4. I really wanted to rate it a 3.5 (cmon Yelp!). Anyway, the food was pretty good. We had the Arctic Char (delicious), the Seared Tuna (great), and the shrimp linguini (ok). I've had better appetizers (steak bruschetta was decent, calamari, and the carpaccia were both just aight).   They made some pretty solid drinks. I had a Gentleman something (crown royal based I think), and my lady tried a Rosemary's baby, which she loved. I woulda killed happy hour here, bc the drinks were great, nice low, steady crowd noise, and a live guitar going in the background. Real nice.  What killed me was the service. It took 10 minutes from the time we sat for our server to initially check on us, and they didn't come by very often at all. My water glass stayed VERY dry, so that was pretty wack, and the appetizers took forever to come out. I'll be back, and I'd be willing to possibly up it to 4 stars if the food stays as good as my first visit, AND we get better service. Chalk it up to being new... they'll figure it out."}
{"text":"Ok....my new love. As I have said before we work in an upscale restaurant at the Venetian, we eat at every new trendy spot here in throughout LV. I don't know how this place has been knocked on food but oh my this places is delicious.  We have came in for lunch, late night after work and dinner all to die for.  Let's start with lunch. It is a small menu and not a big chain driven menu, yeah. But this is what smart restaurant owners do. Start small  and build, make it right, but people out here in Henderson don't understand good food. They are driven by corp spots out here cheesecake,  claim jumper, haha all a joke.  The BLT was beyond expectation, needs to be a little cleaner, but it was great with the pork belly. Devils eggs again yum...sums it up. The burger classic knife in the bun but the flavor  with the house pickles and sauce better than any burger I have had in vegas , but you should offer the addition of bacon. Corn Soup Is Really good. Just needs to be a touch bigger, but the face bowls are cute.   Brunch...ok we came in two weeks in a row. Again small but great and very well executed. The croque was my first love, the server suggested. And my company had the duck hash and french toast with peaches (which was not presented on the menu) ), but much appreciated.  We have had the egg white omelet this was nice and light for a change. And all of my favs were the bennys. I can begin to describe the diverse flavor from the crab to the cod, and the pork belly was sooooo good. This is my hangover spot, but suggestions on the brunch drink variety.   Dinner...both times have been Soo good. Chicken, lobster fettuccine,  ravs, and ny steak.   Service well it needs attention still. Servers don't really know all items on the menu yet, or drinks for that matter. We have had good and Mediocre service here. The blonde at the bar Christy and Asian girl  are great and attentive. The tall bald guy is really good and knowledgeable.  The dark haired one still doesn't k now any of the drinks....uhg!   Paul is very nice and trys to satisfy all our needs and does great on up saling.   But over all for a local spot this is the spot for us. Make this place work because we don't want to stop coming."}
{"text":"Taylor is a blessing to the restaurant! Her knowledge of the menu is incredible. She made sure she took care of everything we needed, from an extra fork to  an extra hand on grabbing left over plates. I will personally keep coming back because of Taylor."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We came here several months ago.  The appetizers were very good but the server forgot to put in our order and the food never came.  He was a tall guy from another country and was more interested in talking than doing his job.  Because the appetizers were good, we decided to give it another try.    That guy was still there but we got another server.  I was a bit surprised that the place was so empty at happy hour, but it became obvious why a bit later.  We got our drinks and we wanted some ice with it.  We had to ask 3 times before it came.  We also asked for some bread which was supposed to come with the meal and it never came.  So we ordered some appetizers, the calamari and some spring rolls.  The calamari was so soggy that we had to send it back.  The spring rolls were also soggy but one person in our group was so hungry that he ate it.  Even a novice cook knows that the oil needs to be hot before you fry it.  Our main courses were mixed.  The short ribs were very good but the carrots that came with it were way undercooked and the sweet potato mash was severely underseasoned.  The lobster ravioli was dry and had very little lobster flavor.  The chicken picata and sea bass plates were acceptable but both were slightly overcooked.  The place has a great menu but needs a decent chef and someone to manage the servers."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for my birthday on a busy Saturday night for drinks. Drinks were good, atmosphere trendy, space is large for a bigger group size; however, I did not like when a food runner came to our table with someone else's food order and huffed and puffed that it was not ours. Sorry to upset you buddy, but you had the wrong table- we had our checks on the table, paid, and we were getting ready to go. He states \"well this is where I was told to go\", well you were clearly told the wrong table, not our fault. The second issue we all had was the woman sitting by herself at the bar behind our table- most likely the manager/owner's wife. She seemed  a little psychotic and had issues with emotional regulation. After seeing her banging on the bar and moving her arms all around, apparently she was upset that the servers kept banging into her chair since our group was crowding the space. She made a big scene over it and then the manager came and asked us to move over. Okay, no big deal, but if you are going to get that upset over it, stay home and let your husband run his business. Many of our friends noticed weird behaviors from her the majority of the time we were there- kind of hard not to notice them. I think Whist has potential, but I recommend a better attitude amongst the employees when faced with a conflict; also whoever's wife this was at the bar, tell her to stay home for now on if she doesn't like a crowd. It only hurts business, which in turn does not support her Louis Vuitton habit."}
{"text":"We arrived excited and hungry, the decor was nice but very cookie cutter \"trendy Vegas\" set-up. We noticed plenty of room inside but the hostess told us it would take 40 minutes to sit inside or we could choose to sit outside and get seated immediately so we chose outside, 10 minutes later a couple arrived and got seated in one of the many tables inside meanwhile we froze outside. We ordered almost immediately but waited over 45 minutes to get our extremely salty cup of seafood risotto and lobster fettuccini that had a little over a teaspoon worth of lobster In it. We noticed a group of people get their food faster than we did and they had only been there for about 20 minutes. Overall the food was bad and pretentious, overpriced and under portioned. Will never return. Places like this are taking the joy out of eating out."}
{"text":"Had a very nice time here ... Good service ... On the down side , portions are a little small. Good jasmine tea!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They have an awesome happy hour Mon-Fri. Drinks are good. My fave is the Mounty. Not much of a whiskey drinker except at Whist. Great date place for dinner. Live music at least on the weekends. Desserts are okay too but their selection could be a bit better. I  hope the District does something about parking. If it gets any worse here it's gonna affect business if it hasn't already. I'll be back! (If I can find a parking spot!)"}
{"text":"Ok, me and my sweetie only came in here for drinks and we walked away so impressed. The ambiance is awesome, very cool, eclectic, but sort of French country, and gorgeous outdoor seating area too. All that aside, amazing service. We had Jamie as our server, who was friendly, welcoming, and on it! Then, we met Daniel, who is currently a bar back, but who, come to find out, makes a lot of their simple syrups and different things for their craft cocktails. Daniel ROCKS! We watched this guy hand make the large round and square ice cubes for the high end scotch and whiskey drinks. This place is the new hidden gem, making, as Daniel described \"pre-prohibition\" mixology. They have gaming, but make no mistake, this is NOT a typical gaming bar. Amazing food, atmosphere, and quality drinks. I mean, they have Delirium Tremens on tap (beer connoisseurs know what I'm talking about)! C'mon Vegas, let's support this new place!!! Ohhhh, and they have a new Bar Manager who is quite the expert on whiskey and Scotch. So much more to come! Really nice to see a bar/restaurant putting forth real effort to create a quality experience and not the usual low class, sub-standard crap you see in this town."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is 5 star: service, decor, vibe, and definitely the food. Went in for brunch, my son and I shared the Bacon Pancakes and the Croque Madame. If it's your first visit, you MUST give these two menu items a try. You will not be disappointed. The Bacon Pancakes were the perfect combination of sweet and salty. The pancakes were perfectly light and fluffy, slightly crisp along the edges with bacon pieces cooked in, topped with bacon strips and a pile of whip cream over the stack, and was served with Maple Bourbon syrup. As for the Croque Madame, well...if I could have it for breakfast every morning and not gain a pound...I would. The bechamel sauce and challah bread sets it apart from any other Croque Madame you've ever had. Loved everything about this place. Can't wait to try out the happy hour menu..."}
{"text":"Yes I loved the atmosphere but the service was horrible! We had to ask 3 times to get water. Our waiter was never around. In the end she left a jug of water so she would not have to come back to us.  The people next to us were seated after us and got food 15-20 minutes before we did. Their server was great and we wish we had her. For our waiter we would thank her and she would not even respond. Even the guy who brought out our food had a bad attitude. Awful, awful service. It was unbelievably bad.   As for the food, I enjoyed my meal a lot but my friends told me the Mac and cheese was bland and it tasted like nothing, so I would not recommend that!   If we decide to come back, I would make sure I make my voice known if this kind of service persists at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for an early brunch as a large party celebrating my niece's adoption & were blown away. The staff went above & beyond to make sure that we were really taken care of. Our server Melissa was attentive & sweet. The food on the brunch menu was AWESOME. The flatbread & French toast sandwich are ridiculously tasty. The true highlight of it all was the manager Robert, who really helped to make such a special day so memorable. What a genuinely great guy. We will all be back, no doubt!! I can't rave enough about the time we had. If you are ever in the District for brunch or just to grab a cocktail, stop by Whist. The space is unique & beautiful, the food is delicious, the service is extraordinary!"}
{"text":"Celebrated #MothersDay with my favorite son at #Whist. I embody everything Champagne - #Moet nice touch $15 per glass. Thank you Robert, Manager for the personal  Moët pour! Freshly baked coffee crumb cake and blueberry muffin with butter is your #breadapp   Sat in the lounge which was cool so my son could see #Game4cavsbulls   Enjoy the vibe and decor! Individual chairs! Definitely unique not status quo dining experience"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, ambiance, and food/drinks!  I think just might be my new favorite place ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We made reservations for a Saturday night. Our table was perfect for a large group and the staff did a great job of taking care of all of us. The cocktails were delicious (I recommend aunt rubys slippers). The food was some of the best I have had. A bit pricy for the small portion sizes, but it's to be expected at a trendy place like this. I would highly recommend coming here for drinks and appetizers with friends. We tried the chicken skewers, beef skewers, and southwest flatbread and all were so incredible that we had to order another round! I will definitely be back. Wish I had stayed here for the entire night instead of wasting half my night at the unfriendly and disappointing due and proper next door."}
{"text":"I was in here on Friday and everything was good. The Risotto was a little oily.  Came in for Sunday Brunch and it was another story. Service was slow. The AC went out and as we are getting ready to leave the server says the computer system is down and she can't process the CC. So instead we are being held hostage. :) I'd have to really consider it before I come back here. So disappointing since I'd rather come to a local place than visit the strip."}
{"text":"I loved the musician, Matt Morgan. He created an amizgly fun atmosphere that went perfect with the decor and vibe of the place. The food and drinks were great (when they got them right). Food and drink service was SO slow. Although, it was well worth the wait. 3 stars"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends for brunch. The sangria was strong but good and the food was delicious, it was a bit pricey but overall the customer service was great. I love the atmosphere of the place and how it is decorated, I could sit there all day."}
{"text":"Even with our rocky start, I would still give it 5 stars. Simply put- the food, ambiance, cocktails, & waiter were that great. We got to the restaurant for our 7:45 reservation, only to find out they hadn't reserved us a table at all. Super annoyed, we took a seat at a high top table. A few minutes later, I mentioned to our waiter that we had a reservation & didn't receive a table. He willingly went outside, lugged it inside & set up a table for two inside.  Aside from the initial hiccup, our experience was fabulous. We ordered the tuna crudo & baked Brie as an app. Highly recommend both, especially the crudo. We got two awesome cocktails- a Stawberry cocktail & the Citrus 16. I had initially ordered a \"Peach Porch\" or something like that. Sounded great, but tasted terrible. The waiter had warned me that it probably wasn't what I was looking for, but offered to allow me to try it and said I could send it back if I didn't like it. Sorry tall, European waiter. Next time I'll listen to you!  For an entree, my husband got the seafood risotto. It was incredible. Tasted more like a paella to me, which I love. A smoky undertone & the chorizo mixed in was delicious. I got the Miso Sea Bass. So fabulous. The sauce mixed with the forbidden rice was one of a kind. As a dessert, we got the peach cobbler. It was baked to perfection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place about 10 times. I'm not sure what changed but it's certainly gone down hill.   I order a Caesar salad, seems simple enough but alas it was awful. The worst salad I've ever had and that's pretty difficult to accomplish. There wasn't even Caesar dressing on it. The best part of the salad was the croutons. Even the cheese tasted bad.   Also ordered the spring rolls, they were meh. Not amazing but not awful. Wouldn't order them.   Friends ordered the wedge salad and Mac and cheese which was good.   The lobster bisque was nothing to write home about and neither was the shrimp pasta.   The place is cute, and romantic and the drinks are good and the wait staff is great but the food is subpar.   We won't be back :/"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday. The food was fantastic, service was good and the manager was very friendly."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed since Chef Nunez left.  I have been back many times & it's not even close to the beginning when there was impeccable service.    Bartenders seem uninterested in serving you, unless you are a regular on video poker & most have no clue about wine.  Not sure why this restaurant was changed from Kennedy's to Presidio to Whist... when it was Kennedy's the menu (tuna chips), bartenders & wine cellar & service was fantastic.    Brunch at Whist used to be delicious w/ a unique Bloody Mary bar.  The Lobster Roll at lunch was my all time fav.  Once it came out, Chef Nunez saw it & ran it back to the kitchen, said that it was on the wrong bread.  Quite the service!  After he left, it's been downhill.  I had the lobster roll twice & both times it came out on different bread so to say the least the service is inconsistent from the kitchen to sitting at the bar.    May come back when they change it to whatever's next."}
{"text":"Came here not too long ago with a couple of coworkers after work. Great atmosphere, the Bartenders are nice. Favorite cocktail thus far is the Upton. Anything with the words 'chocolate' and 'cherry' seems right up my ally. Super chill and relaxed. The food here is great too! Recommend the Oxtail Tacos with any beverage as well as the Mixed Skewer appetizer. The staff was friendly and attentive. They always checked in. Definitely the go to place after work to unwind. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and got bottomless mimosas for $18 which is a pretty good deal! They gave us complimentary muffins when we sat down and they were amazing. This is the cutest little restaurant! We ate outside on the patio and our waiter was dressed up as where's Waldo because it was the day before Halloween! I personally thought the brunch food was a little weird, everything has a twist to it, so I settled on a basic hash browns, eggs, and toast. It was delicious! Very Instagram worthy brunch restaurant"}
{"text":"The menu was okay but the service was really lacking.  Not the first time i was ignored at the bar. I enjoy the drink menu and the food is usually tasty but the service is very hit or miss. A resounding \"meh\" for what should be a solid establishment."}
{"text":"I came for brunch on Easter Sunday & the service was extremely slow. I figured they were just busy with the holiday brunch. I came back to give them another chance and the service is just as slow & terrible. I ordered bottomless mimosas and had to hunt the waitress down to get a refill. I ended up only having two which would have been cheaper to just order two. It's a cute place with a nice ambiance but everything else is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday to meet a friend and we sat on the patio. My friend said that while waiting for me, he had also tried to sit on the patio and was ignored entirely for 10 minutes. Soooo, we tried again and the same bs. Literally, the server was clearly outside, waiting on the other tables but was totally oblivious to us. We timed it to see how long it would take -- 18 minutes before I finally stood up like an a$$hole and waved him over. After that, we was very attentive but honestly, wtf?!?  The drinks were inconsistent. My friend got a margarita from the bar earlier but his 2nd one neither had salt nor a lime. My drink, the grapefruit/vodka one was a little weak. The French onion soup tasted strange and was garnished oddly with pickled onions, which was kinda off putting."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was disgusting. Limp soggy bread with bland tomato mix. Steak bruschetta was good but overpriced. We thought it was a style of flatbread but instead was 3 small crostini. Wedge salad had watery blue cheese dressing. Wine and cocktails were substandard. Service was bad- had to practically beg for bread several times before it came out.  To make matters worse- the chicken sliders were a far cry from what chicken is- looked like dog meat from China- tasted like dog poop. Disgusting.  Spent over $70 for crap. Dave your money."}
{"text":"What a great brunch spot! My BFF and I needed a boozy Sunday brunch and wow did this place deliver!   It was a beautiful, sunny morning so we were able to sit on the patio. Our server was incredibly helpful and adorable. We started with the bottomless bloody Mary's. It included all the fixings for a perfect bloody. Then they brought out the complimentary, freshly baked blueberry muffin and coffee cake. TO DIE FOR!   I had the Crabby in the Morning Benny. It was so good! The eggs were cooked perfectly. The English muffin was toasted perfectly. So good!  My BFF got the Duck Hash (?).  I took a bite and really wanted to steal it.   The service was over the top good. Our server paid very close attention to all of our needs. The chef came over and spoke with us. And I think the GM was very chatty.   This place rocks! My only complaint is, I wished they offered a bottomless mimosa along with the Bloody Mary option. I'd sit in that patio all day if they had bottomless mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"If you want fine dining, great atmosphere and a one of a kind experience this is the most amazing restaurant in Henderson and Vegas. A new passionate chef, Antonio, has revamped the menu with all homemade servings, each made with so much love and care. The service has also stepped up their game and are excellent!! Trust me this is a one of a kind gem with delicious plates you won't find anywhere else, like the crudo/carppacio, skirt steak with fresh made tortilla, salsa and avocado, and a crazy honeycomb pear dish!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this new restaurant/lounge the other day after lunch. Such a FAB vibe!! Even empty it's waaaay cool. From the chandelier collection over the bar, to the really great painting, wallpaper graphic? on the back wall. Someone took some time & EFFORT to create this space that much is clear.    So last nite for a GNO we headed for Whisk~ very buzy for a Thursday and this is a huge space so I was happy that business is going so well for a new restaurant.     We sat at a hi top table that could seat 8/10 people, although we were 3, others were at the table and were perfectly welcoming.  The menu is also creative, we started with a Cheese & Crostini appetizer. Nicely presented with candied walnuts, blue cheese, white cheddar, honey comb, strawberries, blueberries & raspberries, a fig jam, crostini a and a cheese that we couldn't ID, but tasted good. *a nice touch would have been for our server to go over the selection when she brought it, just a thought!  From there we sharedthe Mushroom Risotto . Simply DEEEELISH & the portion was GIGANTIC!!!! so perfect for sharing .  The dessert was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!' Sounded wonderful chocolate donut with cappacino ice cream. The donut looked like a day old from Albertsons and was tasteless the other donut looked like a cake donut but had an odd glaze(?) on it. The entire plate was ODD! DEFINATLTY THIS PART OF THE MENU REQUIRES RETUNING!!!!!!      The drinks are WONDERFUL  a nice menu selection of cocktails & wine & beer  options too.    DEFINATLY will go back and recommend you check out this \"new\" addition to the District."}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot in Green Valley!! Brought my little boy here and he loved the bacon and eggs. My bagels and lox was delish. Sat on the patio. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Tasty calamari.  garbage salad hit the spot.  Great atmosphere to watch the basketball game and watch people.  We will definitely come back for the scallops wrapped in bacon.  This place has a really cool vibe inside and on the patio."}
{"text":"The location is great, love the energy of the atmosphere especially outside on the patio when the weather is nice, looking forward to coming back to try there happy hour"}
{"text":"We came for Happy Hour and were served by Jamie.  I love that they have their Happy Hour menu on the website and couldn't help but notice that it is virtually identical to Due & Proper next door.    We ate--Deviled Egg, The Proper Italian (sandwich), and the Beef sliders.   We drank--The Son of Man martini was delicious, well balanced-- I was worried about an overwhelming \"fake apple\" or overly-sweet flavor a la Jolly Ranchers and it wasn't that at all.  The cinnamon/sugar crusted rim was a nice touch.   My husband was not a fan of his Gentleman's Quarters--they were out of Benedictine and the bartender subbed something else that we were not a fan of.    The bartenders engaged us in conversation and talked shop with us about some of the drinks, other happy hours in town, etc.  Good service, good food, great happy hour prices.    Hoping to return for dinner or brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place in The District because I heard good things and it's close to home.  The hubby & I sat out on the patio; the ambiance was nice.  I ordered the butternut squash soup and my husband ordered the lobster bisque for appetizers .  The squash soup had a really rich and flavorful taste, which included mushrooms & shredded beef that was super tender.  The combination was unique & very good. The lobster bisque was not that great; it had an overwhelming seafood taste.  Obviously, you will taste the lobster, but it was overpowering and very fishy.  My husband was not a fan of it either.  I ordered the filet mignon ($30), which came with mashed potatoes flavored with sherry wine.  The meal was very average tasting, especially for that price.  The wine-flavored potatoes were forgettable; not a good combo and I would never order them again.  My husband ordered flank steak on flatbread, which he said was decent, but didn't say much else about it.  For dessert, he ordered the flourless chocolate cake and thought it was the best part of the meal ($10).  Our bill came up to $100, which was definitely not worth it.  The food was decent, but there's nothing about the place that is overwhelmingly memorable.  There's nothing about the restaurant that would make me ever go back.  If someone were to ask me about it, my response would be, 'meh.'  Save your money; you are better off putting that money toward a couple tanks of gas or new shoes.  I would be surprised if it lasted another year or two."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots. I've been a loyal customer for years; through their several name & menu changes. A friend & I went for drinks & apps last night. We sat on the patio where the furniture was worn, stained, dirty & our menus had food particles on them. The service & food were terrible. I had to get my own silverware setups, ask for a glass of wine three times & wait a long time after requesting my check. I won't visit again."}
{"text":"A wonderful sunday brunch complete with all you can drink mimosas and bloody marys. Not to mention live music.   The place wasn't packed but Im sure that varies on the weekend. There was a big group of us there, about 9. We all ordered from their brunch menu (they also have a lunch menu). Plenty of selections. I got the \"crabby in the morning\" which are eggs benedict with crab meat.   It was very delicious and just right. Servings at this place was plenty. Im pretty sure everyone had a little bit of leftovers.   The service was good. We wouldnt really see our server often, he sort of disappeared a few times. He was friendly, in fact the entire staff was. He seemed to be the kind to just let the group chill as to not hover too much.  The guy singing was reallllllyyy good and he took song requests.  Ill come back to try some of their other food options. I enjoyed it and would recommend this place for you brunchers.   Ill update this as I come back and try more of their food options. Im quite hopeful."}
{"text":"Don't want to hate on another District restaurant but food is so not great.. Cocktails are good. Except do not order a martini. The bartender kept making it dirty despite our request not to. Then he got defensive. Risotto was bad. Charcuterie plate was weak, trader joe could have done better. Nothing artisan about it. Overall disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was super cute! Food was so-so. Got the lobster lasagna and it was ok but just salty and dry. The lobster and red sauce made the dish a little too acidic. The drink was terrible tho. Way too much bitters for a Moscow Mule... Waiter was super cool tho!!"}
{"text":"Excellent we went in apprehensive but came out so happy with our choices. Seafood ressoto and seafood  cioppino so delicious."}
{"text":"The food was great!  The braised short ribs were fantastic!  The pomodoro flat bread was also very good!  I caught the end of happy hour while waiting for a friend and they had a good selection of appetizers and a variety of drinks to choose from.  The bacon wrapped dates are always a favorite.  The servers at the bar and the table were very attentive and knowledgeable.   The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was a band playing inside the smallish space. Made it a little difficult to enjoy the conversation, but overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to see another business take over the spot that Kennedy's held. The decor is what won me over initially and I couldn't wait to try the food. (Fingers crossed it would match the amazing atmosphere)..... Whew! My octopus appetizer was delicious, as was my boyfriend's corn soup (yes, we shared... Kinda. I ate his and he thankfully wouldn't touch my yummy octopus) the heirloom tomato and burrata salad was perfect and his southwest chicken salad had a surprising kick. We will definitely come back again.... Most likely for brunch, which I hear is delicious! Very happy to have this little gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go and finally went around 2pm. I loved the ambiance. Cute mix matched furniture, shiny chandeliers just like a tea room! I ordered the fried lobster sandwich and my husband got the French dip.   The server was helpful but he was very slow. There were a bunch of tables and only one waiter. I think we waited 40 minutes for our food. We didn't order appetizers just so our food would get there faster. We got our food after the couple next to us who came in at the same time and they ordered appetizers.   I would have liked the lobster sandwich way better if it was tempera fried. The way it was fried was very thick and greasy. The brioche bread and the spicy slaw was good. My husband thought his horseradish was not tangy at all and the onions were overwhelming on the french dip. I tasted it and I agree. Overall I would go back. Probally try something else on the menu. The price is reasonable. It's a cute date night or fun friend hangout."}
{"text":"Took my Staff to drinks after work on Friday. Ordered a couple at the bar and when more people showed up we moved to an overflow table. When the waitress showed up she informed us that we weren't allowed to order drinks from the bar if we were sitting at a table. Now I've seen this set up at higher end restaurants. I don't like it there either. But in the end the customer is always right. If they want to order from the bar they should be able to do so. Especially when the service is slow and it was.  Because in typical waitress fashion. She paid most of her attention to another group because she believed they were going to tip her better. We had a pretty horrible time. And I know several of the bartneders there. I'll go get drinks from the bar from time to time but I'll never eat here"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and waited 15 minutes to be seated (place was neither packed nor busy), followed by waiting over AN HOUR for someone to take our order. In fact, I had to flag down a waitress who said \"Sorry, I am not your waitress.\" I asked her to find our waitress because we had been waiting 45 minutes. She did not do that. We waited another 20 minutes and got up and left. Went to the taco place a couple doors down which was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Have been there 3 times and literally still haven't eaten or drank anything as of yet! Not sure if it's because it's a 24/7 bar/ restaurant but the service seems to be very slow and non accommodating. For example the last time (which again wasn't the first time this happened- it was the 3rd) I walked in with 4 other friends. Nobody asked if we needed help. We just stood by the hostess stand which nobody was at for a good 10-15 minutes (and this was around 7pm on a. Monday night) it got so ridiculous that we all started laughing. Then bartender was looking at us and didn't  say anything. There was a server there that didn't say anything and in that moment it reminded me of  the last 2 times I went there the exact same thing happened. At least they are consistent. Now believe me I'm the first to take initiative and go up to an employee and ask if it's sit yourself etc but the situation was just so ridiculous that I had to let it play out. This is the 3rd time!!!"}
{"text":"I only had a couple of drinks and some appetizers. Great local plays with live music on the weekends. Very reasonable priced drinks and good appetizers. Great overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super chill/sheek vibe inside and there patio rocks!! Makes you feel like you're some where in southern California! The happy hour from 3 to 7 is awesome! Great drinks!!! And the deviled eggs are a Must!!if you're in the area check it out!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch good price our sever Brittany was really sweet and kept our glasses full. Most brunch places nowadays leave you hanging and avoid refilling your drinks but our server was on it and made the price worth it. Friendly staff great place. Will return"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now. I keep returning mostly for the nice patio seating and their custom cocktail menu. The food is mediocre at best, I don't know how much I trust it. However the inside and outside decor is beautiful and it's a nice place to hang out for happy hour! They have pretty good happy hour drinks and food items. The service is ok. I've never seen this place busy, so I see a lot of the servers and bartenders just standing around and talking a lot. They checked on us a lot when we were sitting at the bar right in front of them, but when we sit at a table or outside it's like we are invisible. At least they have a great cocktail menu to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Whist, formerly known as Presidio, had been revamped with new decor and a new menu.  It was time to try them out.    We stopped in for lunch.  There is an extreme amount of tables along with seating around the large bar.  The decor is a bit funky and fresh. It flowed very nicely.    We were sat immediately.  The waitress was over to get drink orders quickly.  During the meal, she was a bit slow about checking on our glass status.  We had to wait a few times for her to come back.  She could have been more attentive. I don't know if it was me but the water had a funky taste.  I would expect that in Arizona but not here.    I ordered the Southwest Salad.  This was created with grilled chicken, corn, tomato and jalapeño.  Unexpectedly they put avocado an tortilla chips on top which isn't stated on the menu. I rather enjoyed that.  It wasn't an extremely large salad so without the extra add ons it would have lacked substance.    Whist is ok.  I wouldn't mind stopping in again to try some other menu options.  Since it's open 24 hours and close to home, it makes it way too convenient.  I just hope service improves."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Octopus is to die for. Great addition to Green Valley - nothing like this on this side of town. I hear the new brunch menu is awesome. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  Great cocktails as well"}
{"text":"So my two star review reflects how I have rated this business based on two visits.  My first visit was pretty good over all, not spectacular but enough to return. We went in around 8pm for food and drinks. There was a bit of confusion at the door bc we wanted to be sat at a table and not the bar... but once someone actually came out to the hostess podium, we were sat at a table ( the bartender was yelling over to us, trying to figure out why we wanted...) so not the best start. Our server was super sweet but did not seem knowledgeable about the basics on the menu... like what meat was in a certain dish... food comes out.. everything is pretty good.  So I decide to give this place a second shot... my partner and I decide to sit up at the bar.... the bartender NATE WAS A NIGHTMARE AND WAS SP INCREDIBLY RUDE TO US... I WILL NEVER SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS...  We ask Nate about the Nitro beer.. what's the nitro beer like? HE LAUGHS AT US and says exactly what it sounds like... mind you there no description just the beer name. He could've pulled the bottle out of the fridge and read us the description on the back but to actually laugh... and not playful... but like you dumb b****!.... and it just got worse... I don't even care to discuss it... we never received any service from him after that despite trying to get another round of drinks... took us forever to pay our bill... he refused to make eye contact....  im not sure what the issue was but we were just trying to have a couple drinks, maybe get a couple small plates... but this guy was the epitome of disgustingness. As a food and beverage manager myself I know how to act at a bar... seeing this is the field I have been in for a very long time... this is an employee I would observe and document... terrible person."}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday brunch on a cold rainy morning. Obviously, the outdoor seating area, which normally looks fairly attractive, was out of the question. Inside, the ambience is dark but very warm. The brunch menu is somewhat limited. We decided to get the mac and cheese omelet as a shared appetizer for 5. Frankly, I had never heard of the mac and cheese omelet. However, it turned out exactly as you would picture it. Surprisingly, it was delicious. They also brought complimentary blueberry muffins to the table. These too were quite tasty. For a main course we opted for the challah french toast with their special syrup. It was quite tasty but not especially different from challah french toast that I've had in other restaurants. The service was good with the server being very friendly.  she made sure my coffee cup was never empty. The manager came over to make sure everything was going well. I always appreciate it when the manager is present and ensuring that the meal is going well. Overall a pleasant dining experience but, unfortunately, not outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent, fun food. The best seared tuna I've ever had.  Great, funky decor.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, great food, and wonderful service! A great spot for either a happy hour with the girls or a date night with your significant other. My new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the district! Love coming here for brunch and doing bottomless mimosas or bellinis for $22. Also love coming here just for a drink and sitting at the bar. Always a good ambiance and nice bartenders."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a great spot to grab a drink and chill, apps, or a full meal. Although it has a similar eclectic vibe to Due and Proper and Park on Fremont, I think the food, drinks, and service are much better here.   I love when restaurants constantly update the menu. It forces people to try new things and branch out. It's easy to fall into the mundane \"order the same thing every time\" routine.   Things that I LOVE here (although they may not be on the menu anymore):  Mac & Cheese: I have tried two of their takes on this and both were good. It's the type of mac & cheese you are happy to see when it is placed in front of you. Served in a cute little cast-iron pot, elbow noodles, and crispy cheesy goodness covering the top. YUM. Their new version of mac & cheese has shredded coconut on top. I see what they were trying to do, but I could take or leave it. It doesn't take away from the dish, but it doesn't add much either.  Vegetarian Risotto: I have had another one of their risottos on their previous menu, and this one was equally as amazing. Al dente veggies, perfectly cooked rice, and creamy, warm deliciousness. It was so good. So far, Whist has kicked major butt in the risotto department.   Calamari and deviled eggs: AMAZING. (Especially the deviled eggs, spicy goodness.)  Breakfast is also super good here. Eggs Benedict are delicious. Plus, bottomless mimosas and bloodys during brunch? OKAY, I'm in.   In addition to food, the drinks are outstanding. The bartenders are always creating new things and chances are there is something on the menu that will tickle your fancy. Rosemary's Baby was my favorite. And currently they have a spiced whiskey drink special just for the holidays. If that sounds like your thing, pop in and try it! (I have yet to)  Atmosphere is good and the service is decent. Sometimes have to ask for more water, but the servers are eager to please and very friendly."}
{"text":"When it's freezing outside  and you're starving you ask around and try something new! After a barre class across the street my two cousins an I decided to try a happy hour spot they recommended to us. First glance, we almost didn't go inside because we had on active wear and this spot looks fancy. It was cold inside, so we budged and decided to say the hell with the judgement. This spot was pretty packed at the bar and pub tables. We made a mistake at sitting at the end of a pub table... it was far enough away from the door but somehow when people walked in and out it felt like Canada!  Anyways. The food for the most part was very good. The bacon wrapped dates and cheese balls were a huge hit for me in he HH menu. I enjoyed the calamari too, but when we ordered a second helping (don't judge us) they were fried too hard and not light like the first order. We took a gamble at ordering devil eggs and they are not worth the hassle, bland and we left them on the plate. Nachos were decent and all three drinks on the HH menu were phenomenal!   We also ordered grilled Spanish octopus which came out cold and I had to send it back. My definition of grilled means hot. It was brought back out with the jimica and the octopus separated and I was told because the fruit is cold, that's why my octopus was. If this is the case... they need to do a separate presentation all together. Or get rid of the fruit because it was gross. I just ate the octopus and chimichuri sauce and pushed my plate aside.   Tomato soup was bland and was sent back.   Oxtail tacos.... they literally gave me life!!! Definitely worth while!!!   All in all... I'll have to comeback for the oxtail tacos and DATES. Being at a restaurant and having to send things back for lack of flavor is horrible. Just pick your items wisely."}
{"text":"Wow! That was great! My girlfriend teaches at a studio down the street so after class, 5 of us went for brunch. Outdoor seating is available but at °105 in the valley we went inside. The flamboyant  decor grabbed us immediately,  hip artwork,  extreme light fixtures,  chandeliers, multi -color glass, very cool. We were sat with Paul and everyone loved him. We started with the deviled eggs and Paul also bought us coffee cake and blueberry muffins made in-house,  fantastic. Bottomless bloody ' s and mimosas are offered but I just couldn't do it, this time, however,  great to know. My girl had the smoked salmon salad , bangers and hash for me. While there , the chef stopped by so that was nice. As brunch went so well we are all talking about going back for dinner, hopefully on a night that Paul is there. Also a nice touch was the live music."}
{"text":"HH is Monday-Friday, 3-6PM, featuring a limited menu of food and drink specials. Bartender Jamie (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Clean!) was attentive and informative.  Started off with the SON OF MAN cocktail ($5), which was light and refreshing with a cherry garnish. The DEVILED EGGS ($3 for 4) were topped with crispy onions and jalapeno, but the pepper overpowered all. THE PROPER ITALIAN ($5) is a surprisingly large sandwich stuffed with meats and veggies. The pepperoni in particular stood out, and the bread was nicely crisp, but it would have benefited from more oil and vinegar.  The location was a bit hard for me to find- it's right by the BBQ joint. I liked the cute patio and gorgeous chandeliers over the bar. Classy décor, good service, interesting menu."}
{"text":"We've been liking this place for our Saturday lunch! Good salads and great service."}
{"text":"I like Whist a lot. The location is cool and they have an awesome happy hour. I do wish they'd be a bit more consistent; I've been there on 2 different occasions and purchased pitchers of sangria, but the last time I went the server told me \"they don't sell pitchers here...?\" Nonetheless, it's still one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & the bartenders were on point. The Southwest Chicken Flatbread & Calamari were AWESOME. Both were seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"Would recommend the Southwest flat bread. Excellent selection of cocktails. Our server, Brittney, was very attentive and made wonderful recommendations. Will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Poorly managed. 40 mins to get drinks. Manager states \" oh plenty of staff\". Obviously he doesn't get it! Yes. The problem!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here, cheap prices for really good food! The service can be a little slow but we're friends with the server at this point b/c we love the outside seating so much. Definitely stop by before it goes too hot, also a fan of the music!"}
{"text":"I don't really like to give out negative reviews, but I am, really in hopes that the owner will change the problem. This place has a great theme, and interesting and delicious menu items--but the service here may kill it.  When my friend first told me about this place, she said she didn't know if she would recommend it, despite it being so cute, because of the service.  The first time I went, I found that to be somewhat true--I had to wait 30 mins for my cocktail to come out, and the followup to order food was slow too. But I probably wouldn't have sat down to write a review if not for my experience today.  Today I was meeting my mom there for a pre-birthday brunch on Sunday at about 1:00.  She arrived before me and I met her outside, where she said the waiter said the inside was full, and all the seating outside was in the sun. I immediately thought that was pretty weird, so I went to check. I asked the hostess for a table for two. The hostess (a tall girl with dark brunette hair) said their were some booths by the band she could seat us by. So first off, that was a contradiction of what she had said to my mom, that there was nothing available inside. But I said, the band's pretty loud--there's some tables with shade on the far side, could we sit there? (I had scouted this out earlier--there were 4 tables empty back there, although they needed to be cleaned off.) Yes, she confirmed, there were seats back there in the shade, but we \"we can't seat you out there, because they're dirty.\" Ok... so was she expecting me to walk out and leave, or was she trying to get me to sit at the booths...? I said \"That's fine, we can wait for you to clean the tables,\" and my mom and I had a seat in the waiting chairs. My mom was concerned about the tables outside being too loud, so after about 5 minutes (which, how long does it take to bust a few tables anyway?) I got up and stepped outside to see if the band was too loud out there--satisfied that it wasn't, I took a step to go back inside and the hostess had followed me out. She said \"We can't let you sit out here, because it hasn't been cleaned.\" I told her I was just checking the volume and sat back down in the front. In another 5 mins, she came and let us know the tables were ready. As I stepped outside, I saw the table was in the sun--there was an umbrella by it, but it was casting shade to the table next to it, and that one was completely in the sun. I asked if we could sit in the one in the shade, and she said \"I guess\" and made sort of a show of pulling them apart for us.  After she left, we adjusted our umbrella so that it would block more sun (it rotates at the top), and also adjusted our neighbors' umbrella, who were also asking her if she could do anything about their umbrella. In 100+ degree weather out here in Vegas, where we were already almost perspiring in the shade, it didn't seem to be asking too much for her to sit us in the shade.  The rest of the lunch went great, our actual server, a blonde girl, was terrific, and the food was great.  I explained the whole story, because it was just an ongoing series of poor service--she didn't do anything drastic like pour a drink on our laps or something, but the entire time she made us feel unwelcome, unaccommodated, and honestly, a bit of a burden--like we were forcing her to do all of these things. Here's how her performance could have been better: 1. She should have given us the full options of where to sit at--her main job. Why did she tell my mom there was no inside seating, and all of the seating outside was in the sun? There were clearly umbrellas--did she not think they would cover the tables? And what about inside? She had sent my mother away basically, but when I asked said there were inside tables. I'm not sure if she was discriminating against my mother because they want a younger crowd, or if this hostess was just not thinking, and not particularly accommodating? If they really are trying to make older people go elsewhere, let me just tell you that having a well-dressed 60-year-old female lawyer at your restaurant is NOT something that will negatively impact customers--the treating of them like we received today, however, definitely will. 2. By following me outside to tell me to go sit down, she was showing again that her needs were over mine. What if I HAD decided to go sit at the table to wait for the table to be cleaned? If I had really wanted to do that, why stop me? 3. Sitting us in the sun, after I AND my mother had specifically asked about the sun and getting a shaded table, was ridiculous. She should have tried to accommodate us--not only sat us at the shaded table, but adjusted the umbrella to shade us better, etc.  Either this hostess was straight-out discriminating against us and trying to get us to leave, or she was just completely blind/oblivious to customer needs. It was so off-putting to my mother, I'll never get her to come back, even though it's the kind of place I know she loves."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food, drinks and atmosphere are amazing!!!! Any time I have family and friends in town, I love taking them here. The chef, Antonio, is awesome! He is always super friendly and genuinely cares about the patrons. He seems to want to make sure everyone is happy and his food is the best in Henderson! Had a couple bad experiences with service but they are taking steps to improve it. I will definitely be back, probably a couple times a week!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for a few moments and had a cocktail, but they did not have any fruit to do a mixed drink, only flavored type vodka or gin ,the beer was barely cold without an iced mug or glass. When we sat at the table they told us they had been out of the filet for 3 days and they had a special going on it. The food they did serve was at best maybe a three on a one-to-ten ,although the service was good, I felt kind of sorry for the waiter , as he knew he was serving lousy food, but was very kind. I honestly don't see how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Read the reviews!! Bad service, overpriced mediocre food. Our waitress took our order and then promptly forgot about us for an hour and a half. Drinks were never refilled and we had to ask two different staff members to find our waitress so we could get our check. If she had apologized then it would have been fine but to add insult to injury she literally tossed our check on the table without even looking at us. The food is simple, plain, lacks anything interesting, and at that price point you expect something better, or at least better service!"}
{"text":"We stopped by last weekend for a quick bite to eat and a quiet drink, just the two of us. We were impressed fight away. Not only were we greeted and taken to our corner booth table right away, our waitress brought us water shortly after sitting. I wasn't sure what cocktail to order, the waitress kindly offered her suggestions based on the flavor profile I described. I ordered the cucumber cocktail- it was delicious. We also ordered the spring rolls- they are a must-have! Absolutely delicious! The summer salad was a refreshing way to end the night. The baked brie was delicious in the crisp bread wafers it was served with. The manager checked on us a number of times. I highly recommend this lounge d you are looking for a delicious bite to eat and a quiet place to have a few drinks with someone special, or a close group of friends."}
{"text":"Had a live band which was the only positive but the service was very slow even though the space had under 15 people there and the food was way over priced, $15 for a burger that was flavorless and could have been better served at a chain. Probably won't come back with the other options in the area."}
{"text":"While looking for a place to meet a date, I stumbled upon this new addition to The District. Being that it is from the same people who created Commonwealth et al, I figured it would be worth a shot. At least if the date went bad I could at least check out a new place in town. I must say I was quite impressed and will definitely go back.  This location has been a few establishments over the years. None of which I ever felt the desire to go to though I'm sure they were great. This new \"speak easy\" trend that's happening is pretty great and Whist does it well. The inside in eclectic but quite warm and inviting. As expect there was a fantastic selection of creative food and drinks to pick from but being it was a Monday night, I decided to stick with wine. The bartenders were extremely friendly but not too in your face.   Once my date and I  had a few drinks we decided to try a few appetizers. We went for the Steak and Blue Bruschetta and an Octopus appetizer. We loved both but definitely were bigger fans of the bruschetta. I enjoyed it so much I would definitely get it the next time I go, which I hope will be soon.   The District has changed up a bit and this place makes me believe it's for the better."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I think it is great.  The bartender that helped us was extremely knowledgeable and creative and his drinks where perfect!  The decor and style of the building in general is very upscale and nice which is a nice change of pace to the usual.  It is owned by the same people who own Due and Proper next door and they did both of these places right, in their own specific ways.  I unfortunately have not eaten here but it is definitely in my future.  It is a bit pricier than other places in Henderson but I think it is worth it, at least when it comes to the quality of their drinks and service."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that you must find and enjoy. First of all Whist is open 24/7 days a week and there is a different menu for each occasions. On this visit, my friend and I partook in Sunday brunch which offers bottomless mimosas that you just cannot go wrong with. Additionally, there is a make your own Bloody Mary Bar, that I would be interesting in trying the next time that I am there, because there will be a next time.   I had the Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Bacon. I was surprised when the food arrived and my friend's husband, who had eaten there before laughed and said, \"Yeah they don't skimp on the food portions.\" The gravy was a chipotle like gravy and the biscuits were so fluffy and delicious.   The waitress that was working our section, I think was the only waitress in the area, which included several tables and a party of 20+ people. This is to say that she kept up with all her tables, was apologetic as necessary and friendly when she needed to be. Her service was the extra star that kept my rating at a \"Woohoo\" status.   The other great gem about Whist is the decor! There is such a tasteful, fun and whimsical approach to their design that is hipster, meets a sophisticated attic that's in your cool grandma's house. Make the trip to The District in Green Valley and have some fun at this incredible little restaurant - you're going to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"So good! Tried it today after work... Amazing! The place is super cute you legit feel like you're not in Vegas anymore... Very nice atmosphere... It's very homie.... It's just beautiful in there! The food is great, I went for brunch I had the macaroni and cheese omelet... Loved it."}
{"text":"This place is great! The Justin Chardonnay is delicious and pairs well with the charcuterie board and lobster fettuccine! Great service, fun atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Their food is fantastic, the live music can vary (great, to awful depending on the night), service is hit or miss as well, I prefer to sit at the bar to remedy that.   The long list of items I have tried and liked, a lot:  bacon wrapped scallops - big, cooked perfectly bacon wrapped scallops, what more could you want? how about a pineapple chutney that complements it perfectly? oh and don't forget to eat the greens that come with it!  oxtail tacos - wow, I was kinda sad only 3 came in an order and I had to split that last one with my friend  pan seared grouper - everything on this plate was delicious, highly recommend if you like grouper  loaded truffle tots - do I need to give a description? lol  tuna & watermelon - I was scared, it was delicious, if you like raw tuna and also like watermelon, try it  vegetable risotto - I have to say, yum, the veggies were fresh and the flavors complimented each other  Items that are ok, but nothing to write about. ;)  the district burger beef skewers  I'll keep going back, again and again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the unique atmosphere, food and drink offerings. May be a little expensive for a regular place but we enjoyed the food and drinks. Service was a tad bit slow but the server was friendly and answered our questions. The live music was a bit loud but decent and appropriate for the crowd. We will revisit."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best happy hour with nice ambience, good prices and tasty food! I had my birthday party their during Sunday brunch and we really enjoyed the live music! The service is a little slow but overall I love this place!  I highly recommend their Crabby in the Morning."}
{"text":"Incredibly cute place. Love finding places like these.  We enjoyed happy hour so we were able to try quite a few items on the menu. Sliders, tacos, hummus, calamari...  Great happy hour!  Service was just as great. Our server was around quite a bit and was good about getting our Happy hour food in before the ending time..  I would recommend this spot for a night out!"}
{"text":"We've always had a wonderful experience here, whether dropping in for cocktails or having a nice dinner. Overall food quality has always been excellent, especially the their seafood risotto. The bar offers unique cocktails on par with any mixology bar we've been to. Clientele has always been pleasant and service excellent. We especially enjoy the ambiance of this restaurant which we find relaxing and hip without the appearance of trying to hard."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to love this restaurant. The vibe is amazing, the decor is beautiful and the staff was welcoming and helpful! We really only went in to grab a drink and some dessert. The waitress was talking up their on site aged liquors so my husband decided to try one....well they were out! Disappointing so he tried another drink which he really enjoyed and my drink was good but definitely they pour with a very light hand. Then we ordered 2 desserts, the one that is unique to the restaurant we were super excited to try it and they were out of it too. I understand places run out of things, but it's slow (we've walked by several different occasions and it's never been overly busy) and it's a week night so you shouldn't be running out of items that are unique to your restaurant. We would not go back because If 1/2 of the items we wanted weren't available what should we expect next time?"}
{"text":"My sister recently threw my baby shower at Whist. We had approximately 40ppl in attendance and Rob and his staff worked with us to execute the perfect event.  The food and setup was so chic and elegant and totally exceeded my expectations in terms of taste and presentation. Our servers were so friendly and attentive, making sure our guests had the best time.  Rob was the manager who we worked with and was on duty during the event. He consistently checked in on me and made sure I was enjoying myself.   Thank you Whist, Rob, and the fantastic staff for making my baby shower an event to remember."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my hang out locations. Highly recommended for the vibe and devor, but not a place I'd recommend for food. Yet, they have a great happy hour with $3-5 beers and wines, as well as some great sliders."}
{"text":"Awesome place for drinks with the girls. Love their patio with their \"Refresh\" cocktail!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and my favorite waitress has been Brittney, by FAR. She is so personable and gives you great recommendations. I will be back because of her!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this establishment many times, but have never been here until now. The environment is cool and hip. Outside of the environment there are areas that need improvement. The biggest area is service, the service was just awful. Rude servers, forgetful servers, and long lag time between your order. The sliders and calamari were good, but the deviled egg and proper Italian needs improvement off the happy hour menu. I ordered the pork chop and wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE unless you like hard and dry pork chops with no flavor. However the manager who I didn't get his name, but can describe the gentlemen here is Asian and asked us how everything was and after our complaint he removed items from our ticket which was great and deserves 4 stars for that reason ONLY, however the overall service and food quality warrants this place a 2 star."}
{"text":"Initially when I walked in , I straight off noticed the music was way too loud , hard to carry a good conversation if you are meeting someone for first time .  They sat us at a table right next to the entry way which was not a good spot to see the band playing .  I ordered seafood risotto , rice was still little bit undercooked .  Key lime pie was overly sweet and not the real ones from Florida .  Waiter was super tall almost felt like he was taking down at us , it was not a very personable experience ."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, live music, great food options. Definitely worth another trip. The hash browns can be ordered without crab, which is great if you don't like seafood. Empanadas with cream and apple preserves served with your drinks before your order arrives."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently enjoyed a Sunday brunch here and were so impressed that we are now plotting a return to try their dinner offering.  I had the Crabby in the Morning Benedict, which was much better than I was expecting. Meg nervous amount of crab, excellent muffin, eggs and sauce.  Served perfectly and I enjoyed every bite.  Girlfriend had French toast that was also excellent (I had a piece) along with some hot whiskey infused syrup.  The place was about 3/4 full and our server was really on top of things...we wanted for nothing.  I thought the prices represented a completely fair value.  The facility itself was very hip and up to date trendy."}
{"text":"Brunch was fannnnntastic. Took a 15 year old, sat on the patio and went to town w the menu. $45 did iced coffee, thick cut, fatty bacon and citrus donut holes, just piled it all onto one plate and amazing. Go for it. Then we got the chile verde breakfast burrito and the chicken n waffles (red velvet waffles, might I add) and just devoured them between the two of us. Honestly enough food for three. Everything tasted fantastic and the timing was great, even on a Saturday morning we didn't have to wait more than 15 for everything. They also make French toasts and bennies, but we couldn't make enough room to try more so we made a reservation for tomorrow morning. The lox looked great, too. Our server was Brittney and she was a delight. She had my 15 year old saying things like \"you're the best server we've ever had,\" and making promises to bring his girlfriend back. So cute. I'm glad we went for the recommendations and you should too. Ask for Brit."}
{"text":"By far one of the best \"off strip\" finds for us locals in Las Vegas & Henderson. Well appointed, creatively expressive, Bohemian chic environment all paired with impeccable service and wonderfully unique, memorable eats & libations. Definitely a great secret place to hang for us locals but yet at the same time an awesome place to take guests from out of town for a definite memorable experience like no other!   Chef Antonio Nunez & Master Mixologist Trey Picou are true GODS in their field!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 15 people and was a bit disappointed. The interior is great! It's trendy and has the potential to be so much more. Unfortunately, many of the people in my group were left unsatisfactory and may not return. First, there was only one waiter.. For the entire restaurant. Service was slow and he was forgetful,  we had to remind him about a few items and sent back an order. He stated that they didn't know they would need more waiters on staff however we did make reservations about a week in advance so I'm not sure if they planned only serving us with no walk-ins? Also, our waiter didn't let us know in advance what was unavailable on the menu. A few in my group selected items that were not being served that day and were then asked to make another selection. Not the best way to start. And there's no brunch on weekdays. If you're looking to have brunch in the middle of the week find another restaurant. Overall majority of the food we received was yummy. Just the experience wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Lovely place!!! My friends and I were looking for a casual place to get drinks and apps and of course take some cute pictures and this was the perfect spot! Such a relaxing and beautifully decorated place with great vibes.   The drinks were so refreshing and reasonably priced. We also ordered the brie and chicken skewers which were so so so delicious. I would definitely recommend those dishes!   The service was fast and attentive. Our server was quite friendly and attentive. Perfect place for catching up with friends!"}
{"text":"It was the day after my baby shower, and I had family and friends staying with me and in town, so I called ahead with a party of 26, to make sure they could accommodate us for brunch.  They put us on hold a few minutes, and double checked with their manager, got the ok, and told us to come on over.  We get there and the hostess says they are ready for us, and have a spot on the left side of the bar that we can all fit in.  She leads us to our table.  Our server comes over and is already overwhelmed with our party size.  We got there at 11:00 am, and nobody received their food until 1:00 pm.  My fiancé talked to the manager and he said it's because we chose to sit on the \"Whist\" side and not the \"Due and Proper\" side.  I told them nobody gave us a \"choice\" of where to sit, that I had followed the hostess to wherever she led me.  The last entree dish to come out was my auntie's salad.  By that point, everybody was done with their meals.  The server told us \"well you guys have a party of 26, you'll have to bear with me.\"  It's like the manager and the server were blaming US that our experience there was horrible, when I had specifically called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us.  NOTE TO THE MANAGEMENT/STAFF OF WHIST:  Do not accept a larger party than you can accommodate, just to make money.  I will never be back, and I will not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Whist last night.  We hosted a networking event for a party of about 20.  We had passed appetizers and they were great!  The brie with chili sauce was one of my favorites, but the sliders, deviled eggs, bruschetta, and spinach cheese balls were pretty great too.    Serving a party of 20 can sometime be a challenge for the staff, but Whist handled the night extremely well. If I had to note one thing, I would say that the trays were not completely consistent in the first and second round of being passed.  The second round had less spice and was less salted, so consistency would be one area that could have been better.  That being said, it was still great.   The best part of the night was by far the entertainment.  There was live music and it really brought the place to life.  Definitely a place I would visit again, and wouldn't hesitate to host another event there!!"}
{"text":"Went in during lunch today. Seemed less than stellar to me. They give you pages of menu items to sift through and then, after having reviewed it all, they let me know that only the first page is available during lunch?! And the first page just isn't all that interesting. It seemed to me that lunch was really an after thought. To me, either be open for lunch and do it right or just close for lunch and open only for drinks and dinner.   The service was ok, but pretty slow. I ordered a BLT, which had some kind of meat and sauce on it. It was actually pretty tasty and well done. The fries on the other hand were not good. They're the big thick steak fries that tasted like they've been frozen. Which is a real turn off for me at a restaurant. Just bland and had that freezer after taste. Ice tea was good.  They've got to get a stronger menu during the day and better organized. I wasn't sure how to enter the place or where to go. Entrance isn't that clearly marked as there are multiple doors. It's also a huge restaurant that was almost completely empty."}
{"text":"I wish this place was better.  It is cute & in a great location, but there is very little we enjoyed other than that.  The short rib was so dry & bland that we both used a TON of salt to make it edible.  This dish comes with both mashed sweet potatoes & sweet potato fries, what a boring combo.  Instructions were not followed on friend's dish to leave off the fries.  A green vegetable would have been nice with this dish.  The side of cauliflower was under cooked.  The mixed drink was not good either.  Pretty much disliked everything about both of our meals.  Also the live music was VERY loud & not a great singer. Probably why waiter couldn't hear our above request about the fries.  We couldn't hear each other except when the singer took a break.  Overall a terrible meal. What a shame.  Came here to celebrate a friend's Birthday but won't be back. :( Wish we chose another option for our night!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang and eat! We had great service and great music. Steve and his acoustic guitar kept us totally entertained and he even let the girls sing with him."}
{"text":"Went for Valentines Day dinner.  My husband ordered the Alaskan King Crab Legs special - one pound for $30.  When they brought them out, they smelled.  The Mac & Cheese was okay.  Service was good.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a restaurant in years.  The waitress left us sitting at the table for 30 minutes after we'd finished our meal.  We likely would have ordered more drinks had she attended to us more than once during the entire duration of the meal.  It was not nearly busy enough to remotely justify the poor service.  The food was quite average for the price, further putting a damper on the experience.  Such a pity considering the decor is great."}
{"text":"This beautiful restaurant is set with eclectic decor, lavish furniture & sparkly chandeliers, to the lovely purple water glasses.  Their patio is also delightful and enchanting.  I have been to this establishment twice with different sets of friends, and loved walking each time.  Ok, the food- oh the food...absolutely delicious!  My favorite item on their menu is their SW flatbread .  Their prices are reasonable, as the portions are generous, and they seem to take attention to detail on the ingredients in the entrees."}
{"text":"Arrived for a 6:30 Birthday Dinner.  Ordered cocktails, appetizer (Calamari was so so), proceeded to order the entire ( not impressed for the price).   Try to avoid going when the water fountains are going in the middle of the square, with kids screaming.  Yikes!  Waitress brought water, which was luke warm.  But she was sweet as it was my friends birthday and she brought a bowl of ice cream with sprinkles.  Had the Key Lime Pie which was better the entire.  Oh well.  Guess you have to try these places to make your best judgment call, but I have scratched this one off my list"}
{"text":"Great place for Weekend Brunch. The service is wonderful, ambiance is just so comfortable and the food is always good. Also, a great place for happy hour"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, they have good brunch menu. I really like the outside seating area but it'l was too hot to be outside in the summer. I like the decor there, the middle area is gaming and both sides dining, this place is ok."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Tasty menu. Great live entertainment while at brunch today. Pretty helpful when it comes to gluten free options, although they don't have a specific GF menu. Would like to see the staff take a little more pride in appearance to be honest."}
{"text":"There's really not much to update here. The food is still just ok and the service is as slow as ever. So slow in fact that we cancelled our last round of drinks and went to another bar.  I really have no Idea why this place has such slow service, it seems like there are always servers just walking around and shooting the breeze.   If you're down for the cougar crowd and love watching older fellas creep on young waitresses... Whist has your number."}
{"text":"Lovely!   While the layout is similar to Kennedy's and Presidio, the ambiance is different now.  Love the décor and the lighting and the glassware!  The chandeliers and table \"Tiffany\" lights are great.  Really creates a \"mood\".  Note... the mood is also dependent on the crowd.  If you happen to be there while Football is going on... there are still large TVs over the bar so \"sports patrons\" (like myself) can still get their \"game\" on while enjoying a whole new bar menu and regular dinner menu.  The Drinks...  Oh... the drinks!  Both of the ones we tried were spectacular.  I can't wait to go back and try the others. They are different and adventurous.  Not your typical Margarita, Daquiri, Cosmo type of list... the names are unique and the ingredients are artisan and not 'run of the mill' liquors or liqueurs  or mixes... sure you might find them at Total Wine but would you have the slightest idea how to mix and match them??  WSS has figured it out... and they make for some tasty libations.  The Food... We started off with the Bruschetta which came as a 3 serving (pieces).  It was an appetizer... not meal size or anything huge.  A good starter that was presented on a wooden board.  The grilled bread is what hooked me as well as the fresh, sweet tomatoes and the balsamic. I had the Southwest Chicken salad... it came with pickled jalapenos!  That really added a nice dimension.  The chicken was perfectly grilled and served hot on my salad.  I like it!  I don't like when the chicken is cold.  Anyways...  Overall... I'll be back.  I'm digging the \"new digs\"."}
{"text":"Such slow slow service! Went the whole meal with empty glasses. This place is TOO expensive for such poor service. I witnessed another couple order drinks and leave without food because it was so slow. They have live entertainment that is so loud you cannot hear the people you're with. SO disappointing for my sisters birthday brunch."}
{"text":"The wine selection is great and the prices for the wine are great! I also love the brunch and dinner menus. The bar tender on the night shift is always so kind and recommends really good food! also I've had multiple servers on the brunch shift and they're all so sweet and fun! Favorite place in henderson!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Basically, I love a good bartender and appreciate great service. Every time we sit with the swing shift bartender whose name I believe is Jaime, we have a great time. He remembered us after our first visit a few months back and really made us feel welcomed and valued as customers. Thank you for that ;)   Cocktails... Always on point and always taste great. Seriously... I have yet to taste one that is bad. So I recommend giving anything on their menu a shot, there is something for everyone. They seem to have a pretty good wine selection as well. I always go for a Cabernet or Pinot noir... And they never disappoint here.   The menu is not too big, but they do have the best dang mushrooms. The cauliflower can be made vegan so give that a shot, very crispy, a little sweet and savory and totally colorful! The kale salad was a little small for the price but it was also seasoned well and fresh. I was expecting a little more for the 10 dollars but it was still great:)   The location is easy to find and the decor is very downtownish and different for the district. Adds a little flavor to area;)   I have never sat at the tables but they look comfortable and clean. The machines at the bar seem like they do okay, and the bartender comps accordingly.   Give this place a visit next time you're in he area."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!!!   We asked for two meals without certain things (nuts/cheese) for food allergies. The waitress took the order but our food came back with the ingredients that we're allergic to. They took it back but only picked off the cheese!!! My husbands eyes are burning.. mouth is now swollen and itchy... Who picks off the food when it's an ALLERGY.. They're gonna kill someone. Come here for drinks, be careful if you have allergies."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the service, the atmosphere the food was good and the flavors on point had the salmon salad, and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Nice food selection. Would be nice to have build your own cheese and meat plate. No HH on sat. But live music"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Love the bartenders, love the food, love the drinks, love the ambiance. Great addition to the district."}
{"text":"The food is the least impressive thing about this place. Great service, eclectic atmosphere, nice musical duo playing during brunch. I love bold, complex flavors but when I can't taste the crab in the crab cake benedict, which I normally enjoy, because it's overpowered by the other flavors in the dish it makes the crab irrelevant. Same with the potatoes, all onions & peppers, the potatoes might as well not be an ingredient. Perhaps I just didn't pick the right dish for me but if I'm paying $14 for a crab dish I'd like to be able to taste the crab."}
{"text":"... a ridiculous deal.. ..Whist Stove & Spirits at The District.. .. at happy hour..4-7.. ....a choice of a starter.. a main.. and desert.. ..including a bottle of house wine (not bad).. ... all for $57 for two people"}
{"text":"Went there Sunday night with 2 other people. We had salads---pickled beet w/buratta, wedge, and spinach and kale--fabulous all around. Entrees were: scallops, petit filet, and burgundy braised short ribs. Everyone was thrilled with their meal.  We give it 4 rather than 5 *s for the following reasons.    Many reviewers remark favorably on the atmosphere. For us, it was less than ideal. Although the decor was relatively appealing--in a sort of elevated-Tim-Burton-by-way-of-steampunk sort of way--the atmosphere was schizophrenic. Specifically, the dining area aesthetic was relatively sophisticated, but it contrasted with manic thumping low-brow pop music totally blaring and echoing off the walls, 20-foot ceiling, and concrete floors. I had specifically asked about the music when I called ahead to ask for more specific directions than GPS provides; I heard the cacophony, but the hostess had assured me \"it just sounds loud over the phone, it isn't actually all that loud.\" To their credit, they did turn it down when we got there because it was absurdly loud. Especially for a Sunday night dinner at 7pm.  Furthermore, the bar area is not separated from the dining area---and 3-4 enormous TVs over the bar were blasting basketball.  Again, this struck us as bizarre, given the quality of food and the decor. But given the lack of separation between the bar and dining area, we could hear a group of 3-4 women at the bar (as one in my group remarked \"already three martinis in\") talking in loudly projected nasal voices, and shrieking with laughter.  There were very nice burgundy velvet drapes between the dining and bar areas, and it would have made a world of difference if only they had been able to close them.  The visual alone---looking at velvet instead of gigantic flashing TVs of sports and seeing the people hooting it up at the bar--would have greatly improved the experience. Maybe some people love this, but we agreed it is challenging to have an intimate low-key high quality dinner with all that other stuff going on.  All in all, it was wonderful food, fun decor, truly fabulous service---slightly compromised by elements of the atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"I can't start to describe how much I love this restaurant. I heard about this place from a friend, so I decide to go check it out. Ever since my first experience, I find myself wanting to go back more and more. Robert is the manager of whist and I must say he is one of the best best managers I've spoken to. He is very friendly and attentive. He remembers me and my family every time we go eat there. He also gave us free cocktail vouchers! Taylor is also one of my favorite waitresses there. I had a little get together of 20 people and she was on it! No mistakes, just pure efficiency. Hard to find that these days.          Now to the food! Monday thru Friday they have an amazing happy hour menu from 3-7 pm. Beer, wine and cocktails range from $3-$5. They have deviled eggs ($3), 2 pork or chicken street tacos ($4), nachos (&6), 3 chicken, beef or pork sliders with fries ($5), calamari ($5) and pita /humus ($5). Probably one of the best happy hours I've experienced. Their regular menu is a little more expensive, but the quality of the food is superb! BRUNCH! Stop thinking about and just do it! Saturday -Monday until 4pm I believe. Don't forget about their desserts! When I tried their horchata cheesecake I almost died and went to heaven! This place has won my heart and I find myself coming here once a week to every other week. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend at least going for happy hour. Thanks Robert for all that you do. The end."}
{"text":"I love Whist! The staff are all great, especially Jackie at the bar. The atmosphere is really comfortable, and has a non-Vegas feel. Quite charming inside actually. The food is always great, and in my opinion one of the best options for an upgrade to late night dining if you don't want to go to a bar or pub."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this venue is beautiful and has a lot of potential. However, if I ever return or recommend this place to anyone, it's because the staff has been either replaced or retrained.   I've been here twice. The first time wasn't terrible but there were some things that bothered me. I had a table outside with some friends but went to the bar to grab a drink. I asked the older brunette bartender about some wine. She did not know where any of them were from. Ok... If there was a big wine list this would be understandable. But there were maybe 20 wines? I ended up ordering the riesling which was delicious. I ordered another glass with our server outside but when I got the second glass it was a completely different wine and in a champagne glass. (and no, it was not a champagne). I had to go back to the bar and get the right wine with the bartender who was hitting on my friend.    Because the venue was so beautiful I decided to try it again. While enjoying some drinks a man offered to buy my friend and I a drink which we accepted. After bs-ing for a few we decide to get our check and leave. Well, the same older brunette bartender put the mans drink and his entire parties on my tab. I tried to get her attention multiple times but she was distracted by her phone. I ended up paying it and leaving, it was not even worth the extra trouble. If you like being served by someone who knows what they're doing, stay away from here."}
{"text":"Was there Friday night waited almost 30mins when our table opened up. I was then informed by the hostess that the owners had showed up and were taking my table. I asked if they would comp our round of drinks and that we would wait for the next table. I was told they couldn't do that. What kind of BS is that. I'm a bartender and these are the kind of things that make for great conversations."}
{"text":"Music horrible, shrimp cocktail minuscule for the price, service so-so.   My wine was ok :-/.   The entrees were moderate in size and flavorful but not exquisite. Disco music sucks."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is prrrretty cool.  Great location spot within The District at Green Valley Ranch.  The choices and prices are really decent.  I tried the chicken sliders - comes with three and includes chubby fries.  It's served with buffalo sauce and ketchup.  Slider buns are sesame topped with a little sweetness.  They toast the buns - I liked the bit of crunch.  Has tomatoes and lettuce, and the chicken was chunky and good.  I was full.  Good thing I didn't order the deviled eggs or wrapped dates; cuz I was quite hungry when I met up with friends... late... again :P.    Was about to order a Refresh cocktail made with vodka, cucumber, rosemary, elderflower liqueur, lavender spiced bitters, and lemon.  See why I would've selected this with these attractive ingredients.  But their Red Sangria was strongly suggested.  That's made with rum, brandy, oranges, rasberries, blueberries, and vanilla bean.  I liked it too.  I think I would've preferred the rum and vanilla bean to have more flavor presence.  The serving I had was more fruity than blended with the rest.  Homemade gelato and sorbet is on the menu.  Huckleberry is a high reccomendation.  I enjoyed it and I think I should've paired it with Vanilla Bean instead of Mango sorbet.  Next time I'd wanna try the Pistachio Almond.  They also have creme brulee.  Leave room for dessert!!   I'm an interior decor freak so you know I can't leave that out.  I totally love the interior of this space.  I thought maybe I was underdressed being bundled up in sweats and puffy jacket.  But it was fine.  While the interior looked formal and princely, the servers were extremely casual in attire, yet courteously polite.  Note that there might be some waiting on orders for larger parties.  3.75***×+"}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time I dined here.  My first time was on Valentines day and the service was top knotch and it was the perfect day to sit outside and enjoy their great brunch.  Today I got the Crabby in the Morning, it was good.  The hostess said \"Sorry its my first morning shift I'm usually on nights\" as she was extremely sluggish and seemed half asleep.  We were then sat outside & there were 3 of us and she tried to have US turn the table and make it long to fit all of us - not gonna work.   We then just pushed 2 tables together ourselves.  I had asked for a bottle of their water to be brought to the table and they never brought it and our waters sat empty for most of the meal.  I will be back however I definitely expect better service than we received today.  They do have very nice cutlery and glassware.  The ambiance is great especially for a nice brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Brittney is the best server I've ever had here! This place has great food but usually horrible service! Brittney reassured why we love this place. The weekend flatbread is great, the breakfast burrito, and the classic are all great!  Hostess didn't really seem to be here and not sure what she was doing so we sat ourselves at the high tops and Brittney came up to us with a smile and was more than welcoming!  Thank you so much for everything and we'll be sure to request you again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place more because I love the whimsical atmosphere and location. The issues here began before I was even seated.  I went here for brunch with some girlfriends for one of their birthdays. My friend had made a reservation for eight WEEKS in advance through Open Table. She had received the confirmation and everything. When we show up they told us they had never received the reservation, then changed their story stating they had received it just that morning. They said they could seat us on the patio immediately. Thankfully it wasn't ridiculously hot out when we went so sitting on the patio was actually pleasant.   We all ordered bottomless mimosas and our entrees. The service honestly could have been better on the mimosas, we suggested they just leave a carafe out there for us to save them time but they disregarded it.   I ordered the chorizo frittata with provolone, roasted tomatoes, cipollini onions, and avocado. What I received was an extremely dry and extremely bland circle of overcooked eggs. The chorizo somehow had no flavor and was very dry. The frittata was overcooked. There were entirely too many onions. The whole thing was bad so I only ate a few bites. I definitely would not recommend ordering this under any circumstance.  Since we all ate relatively fast and there were still two hours left for brunch we paid our tab but politely requested that we still get our BOTTOMLESS mimosas as it was our friends birthday and we left the server an extremely large tip to compensate her time. She gave us one more round and basically disappeared. I thought maybe she had cashed out but when I went inside to use the bathroom I saw her inside waiting a table.   We waited around about fifteen minutes longer thinking surely she'd return, but when she didn't we just ended up going next door to Due & Proper. Funny enough, they are owned by the same people and have the same brunch menu. We should have just brunched there where the service was WAY better and we would have been in the air conditioning."}
{"text":"Been here since it opened. Things have changed.. Bartenders have slowly disappeared and the vibe is not what it use to be. There have been changes to selections and service recently. There much to like and has nice location. I will revisit soon to be fair as it used to be 4 star outfit. Last visit 3."}
{"text":"Our family ate here twice while visiting Las Vegas. We ate outdoors on both visits. The service was attentive, if a little slow. Everything we ate was delicious. I had the miso sea bass & it was excellent. I also tried the coconut cauliflower and really liked the unusual dish. Others in our party had pork and the filet and on another visit, someone ordered the Thai flatbread and it was also a hit. Give Whist a try. It's very tasty."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time and it finally happened last night. This review would have been 4-5 stars if not for the last 10 minutes of the evening. The cocktails/ appetisers were really great. A wonderful musician added to the cool / lively vibe of the place. Overall we were having an absolutely fabulous evening, delighted to have found our new hangout place close to work / home. As I settled our bill, my friend was looking for his phone and instead ended up finding folded socks stuffed into the edges of his chair! We informed our server and his immediate reaction was \"oh that's disgusting, let me inform my manager\". After a couple of minutes he came back and the first words out of his mouth were, \"what would you like me to do, what do you want\"? I was so dumbfounded for a split second I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told him \"I don't want anything, I'm informing you of something untoward that occurred\". He said ok, thanks. That was it. We left. Being in the hospitality industry I guess I'm still reeling from the way the situation was handled. We know shit happens all the time in our line of work, it's your attitude and how you handle the situation that defines you as a hospitality professional. This establishment failed on both counts. The manager did not even deign to make an appearance. I can't blame the server, he probably didn't have any guidance on how to handle the situation. I still left a good tip since we did have a wonderful time. However, I won't be back nor will I recommend this place to our guests since they don't seem to care about their customers at all."}
{"text":"I've come to the district for several years and finally found a spot I can really enjoy myself with. It's a Friday night and there's a brilliant guitar player setting the night. We had the most charismatic server named Jimmy, and might I add handsome. Even the mac and cheese was good! I would suggest coming into this place on a weekend night with atmosphere and  cheers, and request to sit in Jimmys section!"}
{"text":"We were there last Friday, (Feb 19) for Happy hour .... Service not great ... Sat at table for 15 minutes before a waitress noticed us ... Asked if we had received menus ... Nope no menus, she said she would let hostess know ... Another 5 to 10 minutes went by and the waitress came by and asked again about the menus, no menus yet, ok, waitress said I'll get them for you ... If we had not been waiting to meet a friend we would have left ... Menus, including Happy hour menu finally ... Note not the one listed on their website ... Wanted to order the Gentlemen's Quarters that was listed on website happy hour menu for $5, waitress reply was we don't make that anymore ... Mentioned it was listed on website, her reply, oh that website has not been updated since 2013! Oh boy ... Ordered Gentlemen Jack on rocks which turned out to be $11 per drink, ($8 per 2 oz pour, plus $3 for the rocks?) ... Wife ordered the Magnolia la rouge, for $5 ... One sip and she ordered a Chardonnay, $5 from happy hour list (also not great) ... Oh waitress asked what was wrong with the drink, wife said it didn't taste good ... She still charged for it ... Oh well ... Happy hour menu listed apps too ... Ordered calamari (not great), hummus was very good, and edamame also pretty good ... Second order of hummus waiter dumped on to table ... Oh well ... Caught it just in time, toasted bread went all over table ... Sorry? .... Atmosphere, staff not very friendly, interior was interesting .... Doors open to patio ... Wife and friend thought it was getting chilly so time to go. Still can't get over the website not being updated ... Weird ..."}
{"text":"No. Just no.   Seafood risotto had a good portion of seafood, but wow, I felt like I was swimming in salt. Someone was very heavy handed with salt. Gordon Ramsey would have been pissed. It was so hard to eat, I barely touched it. So much oil in it as well. To top it off, you'd think they'd clean it a bit when they plate it. Chunks of broken-off sharp pieces of mussel shells in it. As Gordon says, \"What a shame.\"  The charcuterie. Equally disappointing. Grapes didn't look washed. Meats tasted like supermarket packaged deli meats.   Never again."}
{"text":"We have been here a total of 3 times and Andy and I for sure thought this was going to be our new favorite place. We came for brunch a few weeks ago with a large group for a birthday celebration. We sat outside on the patio and had a great experience. We had the deviled eggs and ahi tacos (both so amazing!) but the real stand out was the bacon wrapped dates. We ended having a few orders because they were so amazing! They're stuffed with goat cheese and are beyond savory. For brunch they also have very talented live music. The service was extremely lack luster once we sat on the patio. Our server would disappear and since we had bottomless mimosas I think she was a tad bit annoyed.  Our second time dining was at night and we sat in the little lounge area. We had the dates (of coarse) again and we tried the risotto and the scallops. Food was amazing but once again service wasn't the best. I had to continue walking up to the bar to get drinks for us because our server was no where to be found. I don't know if she was just forgetting about us or what but it wasn't nearly busy enough for her to constantly disappear.  Now for the real bad. It was our anniversary weekend and we chose to come here this past Sunday (Feb 25th) around 2pm for brunch. The bar was slightly packed but we found two seats at the end corner. We were very excited to celebrate and we're going to do the mimosas and our other faves that we had been looking forward to. Not only were we never greeted (after a solid 10 minutes of being there) I attempted to waive down a male bartender and still no luck. We ran out of patience after 15 minutes of still no luck getting the bartenders attention. I went up to a server and asked her if we could just sit at a table and she said I had to talk to the hostess. Considering the hostess was also no where to be found I found a manager (a white bald male) and told him of our struggle and all he said was \"okie dokie\" so we left.    I am extremely saddened by this because we really thought we found our new favorite spot (especially for brunch) but I guess not. 3 stars for the food and -2 for the service and lack of care for the management."}
{"text":"This place is like an Instagram model, beautiful in pictures, not a great experience other than that. We came in for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago and there was a live band absolutely BLASTING music so loud my date and I couldn't even talk to each other sitting very close. They should know not to sit people directly in front of the speakers. Other than that we quickly noticed this was just the same brunch menu as Due & Proper one door down, which was kind of disappointing. Hope one day they get the experience up to par with the aesthetic."}
{"text":"Best octopus on the planet. Must try.  Side note: I am always cold when I visit so I recommend bringing a sweater or jacket."}
{"text":"Sure, they've got all the fancy food...but ya know what's freakin' great? The REGULAR HAMBURGER. Seriously, it's the best hamburger in town...and it's just quietly there, on the bottom of the menu.   Also, last time I was there, the two musicians were amazing. Just two guys, on on drums, one singing and guitar...and for a second I was bothered because they were loud...but they were just so dang good I ended up buying them drinks.   Everyone is friendly, and I've made some friends there, too. ;)"}
{"text":"After my last review, which was very critical, the manager contacted me.  He apologized for the experience I had and asked me to return as his guest.  I went back today and everything was extraordinary.  The food was outstanding, as I had experienced before, and the service was very attentive.  It is so nice to know that this manager cared enough to reach out to me and turn my bad experience into a great one.  I look forward to returning to Whist in the future!"}
{"text":"HH menu is currently available Monday - Friday from 3 pm until 7 pm and 12 am until 3 am.   I came here to meet up with a group of friends during HH. We had a decent size group and they had no problem pushing some of the longer tables together for us. The guy who took our drink and food order was nice, but a bit slow for the place not being very busy (it did pick up later) and seemed to have issues with remembering some of our orders when it came time to pay the bill. When I noticed errors on my bill it took him a long time to get it fixed. I was told that they had servers call out sick and the guy who helped us hadn't waited on tables before and only cleaned them, so while it was frustrating I do believe he did his best, plus we all had split checks. I still don't know what was going on in the kitchen it shouldn't take 35 minutes for a plate of fries to come out.   BLTA Sliders ($5) - This came with 3 sliders and some fries. The buns were tasty as well the bacon and avocado (really more like guac) and the lettuce was fresh and crispy. This not only tasted great, but is priced very fair.   Bacon Wrapped Dates ($7) - Stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped in bacon and drizzled with some sort of nasty BBQ tasting sauce as well pepper pesto. 5 came with the order and these were to date the worse bacon wrapped dates I have ever had. It was missing the smoked almond that I love from the ones at Firefly and the bacon was either overcooked on one date or fatty on the other. The sauce they had on them just didn't taste good in my opinion. Stick with Firefly for these.   Key Lime Pie ($8.25) - I really liked this a lot and it was a great way to end my meal. They can also pack it up for you to take home. My friend ordered the Creme Brulee and I had a couple bites and it also was very good.   Everyone in our group shared with each other and I did enjoy the mac and cheese with duck. The beef carpaccio and tartare that was brought out compliments of the chef was a nice touch considering how long it took to get some of the orders. I also had a HH Sangria priced at $5 that was damn tasty and I would have had another, but as I mentioned the guy was a bit lost and he never brought the 2nd one I ordered. I am in no hurry to come back, but if if friends should want to meet here again I wouldn't be against it. They also have patio seating outside."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday morning for a post Halloween brunch! First things I noticed were the super cute decor and the glassware! Second thing is that the coffee was excellent. Most of the time when I get coffee in a restaurant I get that weird burnt aftertaste and that wasn't my experience at all. My friend got the peanut butter pancakes and I got the crab cake eggs benedict at the recommendation of our server. The crab cake was seasoned and cooked well, not greasy at all! The perfectly poached egg added a nice lusciousness. I didn't love the potatoes though. They were a little too oily and under-seasoned. If they were crispy with more seasoning then they would have gotten a thumbs up from me. My friends pancakes had the perfect amount of richness and sweetness.  Our server was excellent too! Normally I'm good about catching names but I spaced it this trip. If management reads these reviews she was the one dressed up as a cat and we were sitting outside.  Overall, 2 thumbs up from this girl and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never wanted to steal a water glass so bad. I didn't do it, but I plan on google imaging it and finding where I can buy my own because they were just that pretty and fun to drink from.  I loved this place. With a mix of lamps and chandeliers, colored glass vases and cups, cool art, good service and live music how could I not?  We sat at a high top at the bar and ordered the gentleman's quarters, Rosemary's baby and lipstick collar. Ordering drinks with fun names makes for exciting anticipation of what they taste like. Along with those we grabbed a few bites including the charcuterie and cheese plate, lobster bisque and wedge salad.   Everything was delicious. The gentleman's quarters was probably the best whiskey drink I've had. It was so smooth and easy to drink and the brandy cherry (which is apparently one of the most expensive cherrys in the world) was literally the cherry on top. So good. The charcuterie plate had this pepper honey it was served with and I can't stop thinking about it. We had a moment you know? Salami, crostata, cheese and pepper honey. Yum.   Our service was good, we enjoyed our libations and the live music set a great vibe for this unusually cool spot."}
{"text":"Really great menu options and the restaurant is gorgeous. Patio seating for a sunny day."}
{"text":"It seems Wendy works her magic over here at Whist, just like at Due & Proper. A little different menu on this side but everything is Top-Notch, just like next door. A little quieter on this side which is nice. Wendy is on top of the drinks like a Ninja, before you even have to ask!  #WhiskeyNinjas"}
{"text":"I go here fairly regularly.  I'll meet friends and coworkers for happy hour or early dinner.  Went today for Mother's Day and it was horrible.  They give up everything that makes them good in order to make a couple extra bucks for Mother's Day.  Was seated at a folding table with folding chairs, so uncomfortable.  They skimmed down their usual menu to just a few mediocre choices.  And the service was horrible.  Took 20 minutes for coffee alone."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in green valley!  Mon-Fri 3pm - 7pm and midnight - 3am  Their happy hour menu has food and drinks. Great food portions ranging from $3-$6 and drinks from $4-$5. I do believe its only at the bar area however. They do have a lot of space around the bar but do keep in mind a lot of the seats are gaming and they do get reserved by locals nightly. So just try not to get a seat at a machine unless you're playing.  Must Tries: Garlic Edamame, Deviled Eggs, Vegetable Risotto and all of the Sliders.   They also offer full menu with great dinner options from salads, appetizers, steaks, seafood, and pasta.   Service: I don't know that i've ever seen the same host twice but they've all been very kind and seated me immediately. The service is pretty consistently good. Occasionally i get a bartender that i'm not a fan of. She's only nice to the customers she knows and then we're treated like a nuisance. She also ate her entire dinner next to a customer at the gaming machine with no other bartenders at the bar to cover her. I really was not enthused with her service. I will say they could definitely use more hands at the bar though. The other night there were multiple employees standing at the back bar and just one bartender hustling to take orders and make drinks. He still offered great service to us though so not a huge complaint here.   Definitely come for dinner or drinks and their patio is perfect in the summer for cocktails!"}
{"text":"The food is sucks ! The lady bartender March 28, Wed 9 :3o pm no clue about service And isn't friendly."}
{"text":"Food was great, but we couldn't order half the things we wanted because they were out of it or it had been 86'd which was a major bummer."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere here is really cool, it reminds me a lot of Park on Fremont but that's probably the best part about this place. I had read a couple reviews prior to coming in and many have mentioned service wasn't awesome but I figured I'd give it a shot and form my own opinion.. A couple friends and I came in around 12 on a Friday, there was no hostess at the stand so we just kind of sat ourselves. There were two other tables in the place so not busy. Our server was very nice but not very attentive.. The bartender  looked so incredibly unhappy with the world but we didn't speak to her so who knows maybe that's just how her face looks.. Drinks were good but expensive and the food was fairly expensive and not very good in my opinion. I had the chicken pita wrap for about 10$ and it was very tasteless. My friend had the ahi tacos (2) which were 9$ and very tiny. On the way out the hostess smiled and said bye not unpleasantly but not particularly friendly.  Just kind of a weird experience I don't particularly want to have again, maybe I'd try them for happy hour"}
{"text":"As we were walking through The District, my boyfriend and I were absolutely starving and I had a feeling it was happy hour somewhere. We stumbled upon Whist Stove & Spirits and absolutely fell in love with the decor. The inside and outside are beautiful, it has a very vintage antique feel. The glasses make you feel like you're sipping at a Victorian dinner table with a queen. The happy hour menu had a great selection and even better prices. We got the bacon wrapped dates, sliders, calamari, and garlic edamame. Everything was absolutely incredible, the portions were huge and delicious. Our server was great and we will absolutely come back! We glanced at the regular menu as well, which looked amazing as well. Great ambiance, great food, and a great time!"}
{"text":"I really liked Whist! I have been to The District since I like to see movies at GVR, but for some reason, I didn't even know that this place existed. I came here with friends of a friend. It is a really cool place. I liked the decor a lot, it was really cute! They had a creative menu, and we ordered a few things to share. I thought all of the food was great. The other thing that I enjoyed was the live music.I will definitely come back next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are beautiful. However, our food was gross. I got the soup and home made ravioli. My soup tasted like pure cough syrup and my ravioli had a foul stinky taste. My husband got the risotto and the Caesar salad and both tasted like nothing. Our service was poor. I ran out of water twice and my husband got me a refill one of those times. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend to get a drink and some food. The bartender was helpful and friendly. Great service. And the drinks he made for us were delicious and garnished beautifully. I got a couple of appetizers- the octopus and the beef carpaccio. I absolutely hated the octopus. The flavor just didn't work for me. The beef carpaccio was pretty good. My friend ordered the seafood risotto and let me try some of it and it was amazing. I'm gonna get that next time."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch & dinner! Also, offers live music which is very much appreciated. Great vibe, friendly staff, very unique from typical Vegas decor, and a fun delicious food menu! Awesome to enjoy meals with friends, family, and just chill! Not pretentious offering great quality!"}
{"text":"We had horrible service here and the food was not very good. We waited forever despite the place being mostly empty. Nobody ever came to check on is, see if our food was ok, or even refill our water."}
{"text":"Location:  Great!  Ambience:  Great!  Food:  Great!  Service:  wha, wha, wha,  terrible.  The bartenders feel like it's their personal social hour and the patrons are an inconvenience.  I waited 30 minutes today just to pay my tab and I saw 3 different couples come in only to be ignored by staff.  There was no one to greet them or seat them, no sign saying \"seat yourself\" and after waiting and not being acknowledged they all left.  No wonder this place is not busy.  I've been here several times since they opened a few years ago and it's always the same - terrible service.  In a city that prides itself on terrific service, Whist comes up short.  I believe it's a lack of hands on management.  It could be a great place if staff and management valued their customers, but that's simply not the case."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I LOVE IT.  It has a very downtown Las Vegas feel inside. The bartender who took care of us, Tammy, was super helpful and made our drinks with love. Pretty much everything on their specialty drink menu seems yummy. I got the Rosemary's Baby which is sweet, tart and refreshing. My friend got the Gentlemens Court which was a hard hitting smooth whiskey drink also delicious. Tammy also mentioned that there's live music that plays fri & sat nights 9pm-midnight. So definitely will check that out.   Overall... Decor: 100% Service: 1000% Bathroom: ..... n/a Drinks: 1000%  CHECK IT OUT! Highly recommend and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Odd mix of decorating approaches, from mismatched chairs to red curtains and odd paintings.  Service was great. Everyone at our table of 7 felt the food was just so-so. We were there for happy hour so at least those prices were reasonable.  I had their District Burger and thought it was closer to medium rare then how I ordered it as medium. For $15 it was filling with my eating an appetizer as well but the fries I didn't even bother to finish.  The best quote from our group about the food was, \"It's okay, but nothing to write home about.\"  Would I return, nope."}
{"text":"\"Good luck eating here, we've been waiting for 20 minutes and no one has come up to us.\" --table of people when we first walked in  Basically what this guy said was our experience in a nutshell. Our table didn't notice as much due to drinking bottomless mimosas. If the alcohol wasn't happening, we would have been a group of hangry people. Our glasses were filled 3 1/2 times. On the last time, one of the people at our table literally had to go look for our waiter.  I got the mac and cheese omelet. Sounds scrumptious huh? It was okay. I ended up needing to add salt, which is never a good sign. They had fruit as a side, which ended up being a nice balance to a pretty heave entree.  Peanut butter pancakes - right before my friend ordered she said \"And the kids will have the peanut butter pancakes.\" That would have been a good time to forewarn her that it was like a spicy thai peanut sauce. I couldn't even finish a tiny bite.  Edamame - as basic as it sounds, I was really into this. I really enjoyed the sauce they had it in.  Overall, it was an okay experience, but I don't think I'll be back. The service was really just not there and I don't feel like waiting for an hour just to get my food."}
{"text":"Had a light dinner here with my husband. We are pretty light eaters so we just shared a couple appetizers: calamari (happy hr), meat platter, shrimp cocktail. All were equally ok. I had asked the waitress if the cocktail sauce was spicy and let her know I had a sensitivity to spicy foods. She brought me a sample to try and it was fine, so we ordered it. However we ordered the meat platter, which came with 3 meats, 2 of which were spicy, so I couldn't even eat them. I was slightly disappointed that the waitress didn't warn me.  After dinner we moved to the lounge area to enjoy the live music by this great Canadian guitar player/singer. We enjoyed some more cocktails and ordered dessert. The apple cobbler was slightly disappointing, but the attention and service from the manager more than made up for it. I would recommend this place based on the service and entertainment, but not on the food."}
{"text":"I really like the bar scene and the live music, but I feel like the food was mediocre but overpriced. The service was so so but not what I had expected. The decor of the dining room was unique and creative and the drink menu was well crafted. In short, this is a good bar to meet friends for drinks but the restaurant side is average at best..."}
{"text":"Came in with a group last night for a beverage. The hostess was very accommodating in setting up a table for an unexpected party of 14. Kris was our server and he was super nice and knowledgeable. Had an amazing cherry mule while enjoying the live music. We all had a great time and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Blown away by this place! So funky and cool. An awesome spot to hang out. And the food is to die for!!! Will be bringing all my friends back here for sure!"}
{"text":"We dine here often and love everything about the place. The menu has a large variety and the portion sizes are perfect. Great place to meet friends and have a cocktail. The crabby Benedict, breakfast flatbread are my favs. Weekend live entertainment is great too."}
{"text":"Amazing inventive food, Great wine and cocktails, really fun quirky environment. My fav!"}
{"text":"Whist was my husband's and I favorite place for lunch and especially for bunch,  great food,  live music and atmosphere.  If we had company in town this is where we would take them.  We got to know all the bartenders which very friendly and Robert the manager.  Now we learn that Parkway tavern is taking over, that all we need is another sport bar/Tavern in town, they are taking a special place and ruining it.  The new owner plans on allowing smoking and changing this beautiful place.  Sad to say that us in all our friends will be finding another place to go."}
{"text":"Wow I don't know why the reviews are bad. I loved it! For any Phx people, I think it's a lot like Windsor on Central.  The vibe is cool...nice big patio, mismatched chairs, vintage-rustic style...I think it fits in well with The District without being cookie cutter.  The drink menu is creative and varied - exactly what I expected from the owners of Park, Commonwealth, Blvd Cocktail. We sat outside, but I'm sure if you're at the bar, the 'tenders would be happy to make you anything your heart desires....or suggest something better! In addition to cocktails, there's a reasonable beer list and a wine list about 30-long. I appreciate the thought put into the wine list and hope to get a few local selections added to the beer list too! I didn't look too closely at the food menu, but we got a couple apps: the charcuterie board and the fried calamari. Both were very good. The calamari seemed softer and more tender than the usual fried stuff. My main complaint would be that we got a HUGE chunk of blue cheese on our charcuterie plate, but no other cheese. I would be much happier with small portions of 3 cheeses. Just a suggestion! Service was great. Quick, friendly, made great drink recommendations.  It's a little too pricey for everyday ($12-15 for drinks and apps), but I love having a cool place nearby where I can bring visitors and even the kids. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friday and Saturday nights they have live music. It is great for a fun night out. Very chill and relaxing for a glass of wine or full dinner. Brunch is amazing too."}
{"text":"Visited on a very windy Tuesday night at 5 PM for happy hour drinks and food with two friends.  Service: 4/5 Our server was very friendly and kept the drinks fresh.  She was also attentive with clearing the table which was great because our table was relatively small.  Food: 3.5/5 We ordered from the happy hour menu this visit: Deviled Eggs, Pork Sliders, Calamari, and Cheese Balls.  The Pork Sliders and Cheese balls were tasty and enjoyable.  No issues with the calamari and deviled eggs.  I ordered the \"Refresh\" which was a refreshing drink served in a champagne glass: Tito's Vodka, Cucumber, Rosemary, Elderflower Liqueur, Lavender Spiced Bitters, Lemon.  Great drink, but I wished it was served in a regular cocktail glass versus a champagne glass.  Value: 5/5 The Happy Hour menu has great offerings for the price in both food and drink.  It's a great find for future happy hours. (see pics)  Ambiance: 4/5  Some of the tables were placed a little too close to each other as I almost bumped into the table behind me as I was backing out of my seat.I enjoyed the decor and the art displayed on the wall and the lighting compliments the dining experience.  Very classy looking establishment.  Music was playing and the perfect noise level as to not interrupt conversation  Summary: This is a great Happy Hour located in the Green Valley District. The prices for the quality of food and drink received is the expectation I would have for a good happy hour.  For me, it's a perfect place to get some food and drinks before taking a short walk to Green Valley Ranch to watch a movie or for some gaming."}
{"text":"Wow.  Super disappointed. Marginally edible food. Poor service. (Minimal understanding of product or preparation). No chance of a return.  No one running the zoo. No welcome, no thank you, no fu...just a big check for food most of which we left on our plates. Didn't think this could be worse than Kennedys. I was sooo wrong."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some after work cocktails and bites. Had the jerk  calamri, the grilled,    Spanish octopus and the oxtail tacos.   Soooo good. Staff is awesome and super friendly. Also deviled eggs. Great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Atmosphere is great and such a cool and unique spot.  Drinks are good and food was awesome."}
{"text":"Met here with out of town friends this past week, and while I have frequented Whist numerous times before,  and admittedly loving the decor and close to home location, it's the service that continues to disappoint. I'm not sure why after other reviews also stating similar feelings, that the staff doesn't do something to amend the shotty service.   Food is always good to great, and as I mentioned, I love the decor and ambiance, but the service staff, ugh, almost tortuous. Slow is an understatement. And, while our server this last time was friendly, once we moved to the bar, it's like crickets. The bartenders don't smile, you have to use waving arms to grab their attention, even though it was not that busy, and seem annoyed if you actually order a drink. You'd think management would be pushing faster service, orders filled faster, and therefore they'd be making more money.  I'll return if requested by friends, while possibly not acquiescently, I just need to allot a huge space of time."}
{"text":"Incredible experience - this was not just food. My wife and I just enjoyed our first late Sunday brunch at Whist and it did not disappoint. This is a great spot for everyone: couples, friends, families with kids, small and large groups. They had a live band that played a great selection of covers spanning over 5 decades. The music was not too loud and you could still have a conversation, while not being overwhelmed by the excitement of other parties, e.g. young kids or groups out for bottomless mimosas. The ambience is eclectic and we loved all the attention to detail: unique art and wall murals, fun glassware, comfortable seating, and good lighting. Also, there is a great patio for outdoor seating.  Service: 5/5 Everyone was very nice and attentive, from hostess to server. We arrived at 11am and it wasn't too busy. We were seated quickly and were asked on preference of location. The manager (maybe owner), Robert, was very outgoing and made sure that we had a great time. He chatted with us for a couple minutes and even sent us a special gift basket of different muffins to sample. At first, we thought this treatment was just because we were first-time customers, but we quickly noticed that Robert made sure that every patron had a wonderful morning.   Food: 5/5 Coffee - nonmetallic flavor, timely refills. I wish it was on the bolder side, but still very good. Coffee Cake - Awesome! Warm, moist, and uniquely delicious.  Chorizo Frittata - My wife loved it. I'm not a fan of frittatas in general, so I can't fairly comment.  French Toast Breakfast Sandwich - This is a MUST TRY. The chef created this bc Robert loves breakfast sandwiches and it is like nothing I have had at any other restaurant. Not too sweet, refreshing, and looks just as good as it tastes. This gourmet item makes you feel like you have a refined palate. This was the star of the table.  Value: 5/5 For all the reasons I mentioned above. Costs slightly more than typical breakfast, but it was well worth it. This place is highly recommended to check out for an awesome brunch experience.  Hope this was helpful :)"}
{"text":"Best happy hour menu in town! Love the decor and vibe, and food was phenomenal and drinks were delicious... All for less than $5!"}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere if the staff behaves themselves. The the hostess us a snot. Doesn't \"greet\" customers. The waiter is currently sitting next to three annoying drunk woman talking about us. We asked for shade after these women took our shaded table and now we're the bad guys. The waiter made little to no attempt to move the umbrella for shade. I asked again and problem solved. It was not difficult. He is now telling these ladies that he's friends with the chef. No one cares. We're paying good money to be taken care of. I can cook these plates at home!! Do something about your staff!  This is a good thing gone bad!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place before and had such an amazing dinner here. The decor and atmosphere is beautiful. Tonight I came back to expecting another spectacular dinner to only be disappointed. There head chef quit and half of there menu items are gone. Furthermore, there service is extremly slow and the quality of there food has degraded dramatically due to there head chef quitting. A shame really. If you decide to go here I would reccomend sticking to basic dishes until a new head chef arises."}
{"text":"Being a business owner in Las Vegas, I generally give other businesses the benefit of the doubt. My taking the time to leave this review, means it really is deserved. I went there with a couple friends on a Saturday around 6, just looking for drinks and apps to catch up with friends. The place had maybe 9 patrons, so decided we go in. First the hostess was on her cell, no greeting nothing. She seated us, gave us menus. After 10 mins. of staff chatting and making eye contact and waving for someone, we decided to go up to the bar, where at least a bartender would serve us. My friend asked if we could get some drinks and apps, I just let them know that we had been waiting. The hostess was told and I'm pretty sure a manager or assistant manager was told as well, since they stared right at us. Still took  10 more minutes no water nothing.... There was more staff than patrons, mind you, it seems that this young staff, including management is there to have fun rather than serve patrons. We stayed, apps were cold, no consistency to mixed drinks, would give it zero stars if not for the 1 bartender that was the only one actually working. Being from Vegas I am no prude, and am out often. The management here should be embarrassed and replaced, hire staff with actual skills, instead of primping and on personal calls. We won't be back nor will it be recommended."}
{"text":"Just came here for the 50 Shades of Grey special night. Drinks were great. Problem was it took 55 minutes to get our food. Server was very inattentive. Didnt come back until after the meal was done to check on us. Took 25 minutes to get our last bottle of champagne and by that time it was time to go to the movie. We enjoyed the food when it eventually came. We ate the mushroom risotto, yardbird, and lobster bisque. We really wanted to like this place but when the service is this bad it's hard, and I am a server so it takes a lot to upset me."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere as well as the delicious breakfast served at this place, but quite frankly, our server was just awful. We arrived at this location early on a Saturday about two weeks ago and the hostess was nice enough to seat us a few minutes before they officially opened so we wouldn't have to wait outside in the scorching Vegas heat. However, once the server got to our table, our experience went straight downhill. She asked us if we had any more members arriving in our party (2 of us were seated) and we confirmed we were waiting on a few more (2 more). It was obvious that she was already irritated with the fact that our full party had not arrived yet, which was quite upsetting, especially since all she had to do was serve us drinks and allow us to wait for our guests to show up. When our friends arrived a few minutes later, she stood over them demanding their drink orders before then even had a chance to look at the menu to make their selections. Then, when she brought out our drinks, she ended up spilling water all over the table and didn't even offer to wipe it up. Oh and when she brought the pitcher of water to refill our glasses later on, she split more water on the table and laughed off her clumsiness while walking away. Truthfully, if it wasn't for the scrumptious breakfast I tasted from the hard work of the chefs back in the kitchen, I'd never come back. In fact, make sure to bring cash when you dine at the restaurant in case your waitress makes some lame excuse as to why she can't split checks more than two ways like ours did. Her rationale was simply \"the computer gets angry at me when I do it\" which translates to \"I'm just too lazy and don't want to assist you any further\". Come for the food, but don't expect great service from your waitress. Hopefully management will weed out the \"bad eggs\" at this place so customers can be pleased with the service they received and eager to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Their Turning Point cocktail is super good!! It's really refreshing and the flavor a were just awesome!  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar. Bartender took awhile to greet us. We then asked for a menu,(assuming she was going to give us one menu each) checked out their selection of cocktails/beers as a normal beginning dinner thing. I ordered the Turning Point, while my boyfriend ordered a Duvel Beer. She gave him his beef first cause it was on tap. As I was sitting in front of the bartender, I was watching her make my drink. Her index finger was on top of the straw that she gave me. I don't know where your hands have been, but your hands aren't that clean. I don't know why she was holding the straw as if she was going to taste it. I ended up taking the straw aside and got a new one. It's a health code violation.   The lady bartender looked kinda mean. She barely checked up on us and was pretty slow. The food was awesome... Service just needs a little work.   The food items that we ordered were the charcuterie plate, the grilled octopus, lobster fettuccine, pork chop. The food was good. We will be back soon! =D"}
{"text":"During a recent trip, my husband and I stumbled across this place for lunch and I'm so glad we did. It was delicious! Since it was a nice day out, we sat on the patio. I loved how comfy the patio was and it was decorated very nice.   I ordered the French Dip and my husband ordered the BBQ bourbon pork. OMG. Both were so good. After eating half of our sandwiches, we switched plates so we could try the other's sandwich. The French Dip was super flavorful. The meat wasn't as tender as expected, but it was still good. The BBQ bourbon pork... this really was the winner. The flavor was out of this world and the pork was extremely tender. It was sweet and spicy and mmm, so good. On top of the great food, we had great service. Our waiter was super nice, prompt, and helpful.   Before we left, we used the restrooms and got to see the inside of the restaurant. I loved it! It was very hip and chic. It had an 'Alice in Wonderland' vibe and was super cool.  Overall, the food was good, the service was good, and it was a cool place. If in the area, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Spicy chicken and red velvet waffle was incredible, chicken was moist and tender, waffle was more like a red velvet cake but I think that only made it more tasty. Bottomless watermelon sangrias, Mary's, Bellinis, mimosas, love music... What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Whist has a cute ambiance and occasionally cute customers ;)  The decorations are cute and if you're looking for a new Instagram photo you'll find plenty of cute spots to pose. The bar area is large and even has video poker and sports games playing.  The happy hour is probably the only time I will come here. For $5-10 you can get a couple of decent appetizers and yummy alcoholic drinks. The sangria is huge and the Refresher is probably my favorite on the menu.  The meals are decent, but pretty overpriced for what you're getting. It's weird for me to eat a meal here, because most of their seating is either bar seating or low table/couches. The charcuterie board was good, but there's a place that serves a better one inside GVR ;)  The pasta was small, but good. Hard to justify the price.  It's a huge spot, for the small amount of customers. I wouldn't recommend driving out here just for Whist, but if you're in the area it's a cute place to stop by."}
{"text":"Very surprised with the great food but completely surprised with the portions. My wife and I had a great dinner. Parking is always an issue at the district. But not their fault."}
{"text":"We came here once, although I would come back maybe for brunch. Their service at the front door was not good as the girl was on her phone and didn't notice customers were waiting to be seated, however our waiter made up for it. The food was good and the drinks were very strong."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here! 3-7 Mon-Fri and great prices! Love that there is appetizer and entree options. My husband and I love the deviled eggs and wrapped dates  (next time I'll order them without the Bleu cheese, I just can't do it). The options are awesome at a reasonable price. I also ordered the cheese balls but would've preferred if they were filled instead of puffed up. Also not a huge fan of spinach.   My husband ordered the District burger which he said he enjoyed. I ordered the beef sliders which were really good. What are vegetables? I didn't even bother to put the lettuce and tomato on there which come on the side, the seasoning from the beef and caramelized onions was just right, why bother with any freshness.   It's always nice to eat outside on a day when the weather permits. We actually brought our newborn and sat outside so if she cries it won't bother other patrons and for a Friday there was plenty of seating in the early evening.  Overall a good meal, the service was lacking as the waiter was a bit dry but the ambiance, decor, and food make it a good experience."}
{"text":"Happy Hour on Wed from 4 to 6. Decor is lovely, a little Victorian with the English furnishings and chandeliers yet it had kind of an eclectic feel to it as well so interesting. The bar was quiet early on got a bit busier later, not standing room only by any stretch. The bartender was fantastic, attentive, positive and professional after my experience at Hank's I was starting to doubt that a bartender under 30 could be a professional!! As the star rating says I am a fan. Next Happy Hour, Standard & Pour...onward"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The waiter yes was nice, but failed to return my debit card l KNEW they still had my card. So i called shortly after leaving. The hostess who answered the phone couldn't have been more rude. She told me to call back the next day so I did. Then again I talked to an even more rude hostess to say my card was not there. I called yet another time before going through the hassle of having to cancel my card. Once again I get the an incredible amount of attitude from the hostess on the phone. I told her please i know it is there. So now its almost 24 hours after my card was \"lost\". I finally decided to cancel my card because they said it was not there, 3 TIMES!! A few hours later i get a call saying they had my card. What a pain these people were dealing with when originally she could have just talked to the waiter like I had originally asked. Now have to go through the hassle of getting all my linked accounts changed. The hostesses who answer the phones are so incredibly rude. Maybe you couldn't find it at first but at least be pleasant on the phone."}
{"text":"Man, this was a hard review and I will have to re-visit and hope MY experience will be better... 1st, the bartender did not know what beers he had on tap, or what they were... Tried to tell me Duval was an IPA, or IPA \"like\"..... FAIL  Next, when He did find out they have Sculpin in tap ( a IPA ), it was $9 ... For a 14oz. pour... Not even a pint!!  I'm sure they have to make $$ after their re-model/ name change....  But I was the ONLY customer....  Maybe they should re-think a few prices when the places around them charge less for draft beers.  Sorry, hate to give bad reviews, but MY experience was not that good."}
{"text":"Yikes! This downgrade due to food quality and service is a bit overdue, but necessary. My husband and I had previously enjoyed this spot for a Sunday brunch, but had a bad dinner experience here this summer.   The restaurant was significantly less busy than every other restaurant in the area and we were hungry so this won for our dinner pick. There were only about half a dozen tables with diners.   I started with a cocktail and bacon wrapped dates. Both of those were good. Then began the longest wait. I noticed a table near us complaining, but figured they were just crabby and wrote it off. Then the longer we waited I realized why the other table had been complaining. The restaurant was nearly empty so the wait didn't make sense. Our waiter apologized for the delay and offered both of us a free cocktail for the delay. I really appreciated that he tried to make it right and this would have been an unexpected, but appreciated save for the experience. Unfortunately, our meals came out and nothing was going to forgive my meal.   I'll start with the good. My husband ordered the Seafood Risotto and he enjoyed this meal. There was a nice amount of seafood and the flavor was nice. I had the Burgundy Braised Short Rib which came with sweet potatoes and carrots. Short ribs can't be messed up, but somehow Whist Stove & Spirits managed to do just that. The short rib looked like charcoal on top, but as visible in the photo they tried to cover it with pieces of crispy sweet potato. Nothing about this dish was good. We also ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts that were not prepared properly as they were still very hard and missing any bit of tenderness. The flavor wasn't bad, but they were too hard to eat. It was disappointing considering how long we had waited for the food.  I don't relish writing reviews like this. My husband and I wanted to like this restaurant since we find ourselves at The District to eat pretty often. The décor inside the restaurant is still very pretty and they have a lovely patio for outdoor dining. Unfortunately, there are too many good options at The District for me to justify returning to Whist & Stove."}
{"text":"Had a great experience ! I have been here a couple times and I have fallen in love with not only the decor and the happy hour but even the night owl menu and my amazing server Cory ! Thank you Cory for making my dinner and my time with my visit an amazing time !"}
{"text":"I went there last night with a friend. Great place! Loved the atmosphere. Food was good. Service was good. Happy Hour food selection wasn't up to my standard if you're doing happy hour but maybe they'll add to it. I'd go back for sure. I hope people go so they stay in business."}
{"text":"I grew up on kennedys and was super excited to try this place. Everything I ordered was spot on and delicious and the service was really exceptional. They went above and beyond... Some things weren't perfect but the way the staff handled everything made this experience so memorable and I can't wait to go back.   The food: deviled eggs .. Sooo delicious  Polenta. Maybe one of the smartest and most delicious dish I've had in a long time. Had a bite at the end because it was mixed with jalapeño and dipped in sour cream. With some delicious greens. It was so very good. My fave dish by far.  Wedge salad. Everything and more.   Meal: I ordered burger protein style which, if I'm being honest always suck and it just something I force myself to eat.. But the meat was actually delicious and I had zero complaints.   If someone wants a quick delicious bite.. The deviled eggs, polenta and a few protein dishes from the appetizer menu are so lovely and filling. I just couldn't get over what an amazing time and meal I had. Did I mention the polenta was the star dish?!?!"}
{"text":"My son and one of his friends met us here and it was great. The food was wonderful the beer was great and you need to try the Oxtail per (Trey) great recommendation. Trey was absolutely great. It's close to our house and cool place. We will be going back often. You should try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!  Small portions, cheap quality.  Waited 45 minutes for the good.  It was better when it was presidio. Never eating there again!  Don't waste ur time and money."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new place when they were doing a promotion for \"50 Shades of Grey\" tonight. Unfortunately our waitress was so inattentive. She never came back after she took our last food order, to see how it was, if we wanted more drinks, and ignored the fact that we ordered another bottle of champagne. Plus our food took over 45 minutes to come out. Likely won't be coming back here again when there are so many other options around this area. Don't sit with Kaitlyn."}
{"text":"Checked this place out a few weeks ago on my wife's actual birthday. We both were very impressed with the food, prices and services levels. Our only caveat is that the kitchen is very slow, so be prepared to wait. Our dinner took right around 2 hours...which included several waits in between courses.   They're menu is vast and has a bit of something for everyone. The oxtail tacos, southwest salad and loaded truffle tater tots are amazing...as is the skirt steak, calamari, shrimp linguine, and spring rolls. The first 3 are must haves!  Brittney was our server, ask for her section...she is great! We got a chance to speak with Scott, the GM...he took the time to listen and apologized for our experience regarding the wait time.   Even with the wait, we will definitely be back. The service and food is worth the wait! Hopefully it gets better though."}
{"text":"The first time we dined at this restaurant was on the patio. Seems patio service was better then the second time when we dined inside this past Saturday night. The service  was not that great. The server seemed to have disappeared from time to time. We ordered calamari, oxtail tacos and shrimp salad. We waited an entire hour for our food. All of the food was spicy.  I don't understand why all the food had to be spicy. We had to find someone so we could finally pay our bill. The waiter apologized and said the kitchen was backed up. They did take off the calamari because of the wait time. We will probably not return."}
{"text":"Meh a little on the classy side for a guy like me but the outside seating is wonderful and the servers make you feel very welcome which is nice. Can't say I'm a fan of the food none of it is really my style but the chicken on the sick was yummy. Drinks are made well here and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Well this visit was kind of interesting...... The food is good, the menu has changed some, but the service still has a lot to be desired.    The waiter brought us drinks pretty fast but then you had to flag him down to ask for a refill.  After I asked for a refill, he said ok and then forgot for a bit, then realized he didn't bring me a refill and got it.  The food took a while to come out and then again he never came back to check on our drinks and we needed to flag him down to get a box and the bill.  After we asked for a box and the bill, he brought the box and then went over to the bar and started talking with the Bartendar while we sat and waited for the bill. He finally went and got the bill and brought it.  The time he spent at the bar until we got the check was not excessively long, but you felt like you were not the priority.  As for the food, I ordered the spring roll appetizer and even though it was good, it was not worth almost $14 for that dish and is something I will not order again.  Everything else was priced reasonably.  This is a good place and we will go back, it's just hit and miss with the service."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day and it was somewhat of a let down from our previous trips. Out waiter was brand new but he was up front in telling us that and did a good job. The lobster bisque  was still very good but the rest of the meal was hit and miss all the way. The real bummer was my drink. The worst top shelf  margarita I have ever had. There seems to be a lot of turn over.....i.e. never the same people when we go there.... I don't think we will be back for a while...too many other options."}
{"text":"What a new secret treasure The District has! Went in for lunch and dinner, food was amazing and the speciality cocktails were to die for! I recommend the pick pocket! Make sure to take the time and check this new place out. You will become addicted as I have."}
{"text":"This was our first stop after a great meal in The District. My first time back to visit there in several years. This venue is very big with the focal point being the bar in the center with many many many seats, super comfy leather bar chairs, that's always a plus.  They have several tvs that align the outskirts if u enjoy sports, but they do not dominate the ambiance nor give it a sports pub feel as sometimes tvs can do.  They also have video poker, but again, the place is so pretty & comfortable with such a classy feel, the machines actually\"add\" their own\"flavor\". (It is Vegas, after all). We stopped in for cocktails & people were scattered about. This is a pretty large space & great location for larger groups. The photos of their food look yum. If I lived in the area, this would certainly be one of my go-to spots for cocktails & apetizers. Casual-upscale, friendly sexy vibe."}
{"text":"Fun spot for a late night dinner.  Environment: when I came here, there was live music which I really enjoyed. The crowd was very social and the scene was pretty hipster with some old fashion decorations and chandelier. They have a bar area and table seating.  Service: I was seated quickly and the food came out promptly. Although I could not tell the staff apart from the customers, it was kind of nice because I felt like everyone was just being friendly.  Food and drinks: I really liked the food. He beef carpaccio was delicious and buttery. The grilled octopus was just as I expected, but what I really enjoyed was the pasta with shrimp. It was spicy, creamy, and the grilled shrimp really topped it off. The drinks I had were strong but delicious, and I definitely wouldn't mind coming back just to hang out at the bar.  Overall, the drinks are great and if you are ever wanting to hang out at night, it is open 24-7. Their brunch option looked good too, so I'll definitely be back to try it out."}
{"text":"We came during the happy hour pricing and although we only stuck to drinks, they were well worth the $5. Food seemed to have a lot of variety but only one vegetarian option outside of side dishes. The waitress was friendly and gave us a heads up when the $5 drink was turning into an $11 drink because happy hour was ending. Some places will continue bringing your drinks and you will noticed you ordered some after happy hour once the bill comes out. Overall it was a cute place in a fun area (we sat outside) and I would have given 5 stars if I was able to find a menu item to fit my diet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are amazing, the crab with hash browns is amazing, really enjoyed bottomless mimosas, manager took over when service was a bit slow and we had a great time...we will be there again and will bring out of town friends."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good...because there was a lot! Amazing food! My friend and I came for brunch and ordered the French Toastowitz- challah bread with bourbon maple syrup, bagels and lox and the Crabby In The Morning Benedict - crab with an amazing béarnaise sauce. Good portion sizes, great flavor in each dish.  Fantastic ambiance and we loved the option to sit on the patio.   However, the negatives... When we were seated we decided to start with bottomless mimosas and were immediately asked what we wanted to order without any time to look at the menu. We asked for a few minutes. After 25 minutes we still had no mimosas, no order taken, no water. Nothing. Asked a different waitress that passed by if someone would be by shortly and she said she would get our waitress. After 40 minutes Taylor made her way to the table was incredibly apologetic and explained that they were 6 people short and very busy. She took our order and made sure we had water and mimosas on the way.  While the wait was fairly ridiculous, I'm not one to complain to the staff or ask for freebies. However Taylor took it upon herself to rectify the lengthy wait and comped our beverages. Had they been properly staffed, my review would probably been a solid 4 if not 5 stars. I'll definitely be back and will be dreaming of that French toast in the meantime."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 5 times in the last 4 months.  We've had the Lobster Pasta several times which is great, they even make the pasta from scratch..We've tried the Fajitas which are served kinda neat and very tasty.. calamari is the run of the mill like every other place.. sliders good.. The meat and cheese platter I really didn't enjoy that much but you do get too choose what you want on there so that's nice..  We've also had the chicken & the shrimp flat bread and both of those were excellent...  The STAR of the show for me though and I get it EVERY TIME is the Blue Cheese wedge salad.  I just love it!!!  This place is very cute inside and great for date nights or ladies nights..  I've noticed that the male servers seem too be more attentive than female..  I know that sounds like a stereotype but it isn't.. its just my observation..They have small happy hour menu Monday thru Friday that lasts till 7 I believe..  If you order outside of that and have cocktails be prepared too spend around $100..  We really enjoy ourselves here though so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Quirky atmosphere, efficient service, good food, drinks with live music! Perfect for a date night or dinner/drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly really good. Service was really friendly and prompt. Based off what I was reading about other reviews I think it depends on who you get for your server. I ordered the oxtail taco and the refreshing mojito. Both were excellent. It is right next to Due Proper so sign is hard to do find for me. Give this place a try. They do have live music on Fridays."}
{"text":"Love this place. We seem to end up here once a week. Food and cocktails are creative, fun, and delicious. Service has always been excellent. Definately my favorite happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I concur with the other reviews that say this place has gone way downhill. I picked it despite the reviews because the menu was promising. And I'm honestly not nit-picky, I generally enjoy going out to restaurants. The short ribs were overcooked, dry, and bland. There was a discernable burgundy sauce but it was pretty flavorless. The cauliflower was undercooked. The waiter apparently didn't hear or understand my specific requests and the order was wrong. The music was disruptive. We literally sat in the corner diagonally away from the musician and used our outside voices to hear each other. I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is. A bottle of Justin Cabernet $34?  Prisoner wine is only $10 more than the liquor store?  Great beer selection, outstanding service and amazing plate presentation. This place is such a cool hangout and decorated so snazzy. Great place to have in green valley. Menu prices are very approachable. Food quality top notch Wasn't 1 dish there I wouldn't order again. Everything was outstanding and I can't wait to return!  I posted pics of all the dishes I had. Didn't leave one bite unfinished!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We had a party of 4. We were seated outside and waited over 25 mins. I finally went in and said something and was told someone would be out. During. That 25 mins they had 3 servers outside helping everyone else and even helping people who were sat after us. Finally someone came to the table and said do you want something. So we ordered and were never asked if we wanted any drinks. We waited 30 more mins and nothing.  I am so disappointed in the service and treatment. Never have we been treated that way by a restaurant in the District."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to review this place for a long time. Finally,... here I go!  Eminence is beyond 5 star.   Food is excellent!!!!  I have been here more times than I can count at this point. Have ordered food across the menu. Breakfast/Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. Have NEVER been disappointed. Have never thought it could be better than what I thought I was ordering based on the menu description. Always delicious!!!  Last, the entire staff is fantastic!!!  The general manager (a guy who's name I do not know) appears to love the place as if it's his own business. (I actually asked him once if it was his place. Ha ha. That is the only reason I know it's not.)  All of the wait staff are happy to be attentive and accommodating. But I have to give a special shout out to Melissa. She's the daytime bartender and is soooooo wonderful!!!    The place is always paced at night. I want to see Melissa busier during the day. She is so sweet, personable, and an excellent bartender. If you're in the area and need a lunch spot, go to Whist!!!!  If you're lucky, Melissa will be working. But even if she's not, you'll still love your experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my best friend and both times were great. The drink Rosemary's baby is awesome, I could and did have a few of those the second time. I like the decor, it's interesting. The second time we went there we had the cheese board and a bunch of the sides and it was a really good mix up of food. We totally enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"So a few friends and I rented an Air BnB for the weekend in Henderson, NV about 15 minutes from the strip. Sunday morning we woke up looking for a great brunch spot. Now, I'm from Los Angeles, so a nice brunch spot comes with a certain atmosphere and vibe. Let me tell you, this place belongs in the heart of Beverly Hills. They have great priced bottomless mimosas, great priced food, and live music on Sundays!!! I met the Manager Robert, and immediately I recognized the energy on this Sunday morning came from this guy. My waiter, Andy as well was a pleasure. This is a must visit location. Not to far from the strip."}
{"text":"On a beautiful Sunday morning, I visited Whist with the hopes to have a fun brunch with a confidant. We were seated right away by a very sweet hostess. Our server was efficient and cordial. The manager, Rob, was personable. He stopped by the table personally and answered questions about the menu. He was very knowledgeable and genuine. Moreover, he was consistently helping with the restaurant's needs by running food and pouring water. Bloody Mary bar was fun, there were many optional garnishes including olives, bacon, cucumbers and hot sauce. The music was also a very nice touch, we just wished we heard some John Denver :) A great place for brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Appetizers are so disappointedly bad.  We ordered: the Ox Tail tacos, friend calamari, skewers, coconut cauliflower. Every single thing was horrible.  And not worth the money  Have tried the entrees but I probably won't. Service was great, they have a great late night shift bartender, makes great martinis. If I go back again probably for the martini, no so much the food."}
{"text":"This by far is one of my favorite places to be. The staff is always friendly and extremely knowledgeable on their menu items. Everyone that works at the host stand always greets you with a smile and completely accommodating! Recently they got rid of my favorite appetizer the tuna watermelon thing which sounds really gross but actually is AMAZING! But every server I have had has been able to recommend great substitutions for me. I love the décor and again the staff has been great! To me it has to be one of the hippest places to go for dinner or even to get drinks with friends. It does help that the staff members are all really great eye candy as well, even the tall guy with the huge biceps!"}
{"text":"This place would be perfect for a date or a drink with friends.  Ambience is super nice...luxurious but a little bit eclectic. Lots of screens to watch sports or MMA. You can sit at the bar right next to the bartenders, on side tables, or outside!   The food is pretty expensive (i.e. Chicken entree is ~$21, but I had the lobster bisque for $8 and it was delicious even though the portion size was very small. Also ordered the beef skewers $9 and the crispy tater tots.  Beef skewers had this delicious peanut sauce and tasted awesome but it was a ridiculously small portion. Literally a mouthful of meat per skewer. You will not be full at the slightest with an order of this. Crispy tater tots were delicious and way more filling.    Service: this service was super nice and friendly and our server was great with drink recommendations and making sure we had enough water refills. However our only annoyance was that they forgot our beef skewers/Tator tots order completely... So that was one thing they could improve on.   The reason for such a high rating is because the drinks were super delicious, and we asked for speciality cocktails like (\"give me something fruity with gin\"), and each time the cocktail was absolutely delicious! Also a round of 4 drinks was $37, which is a great price!  My zombie was a little too sour, but my Mai tai and Long Island ice tea were made to absolute perfection.   I believe that the food here is a little overpriced from what I sampled, but definitely come here to get the delicious drinks and enjoy this very classy and beautifully decorated bar. The drinks here are the best!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Especially during happy hour. Me and my friend visited this establishment looking for good cocktails, music and food. We sat at the bar and enjoyed very fast and quick service from the bartenders.  I tried multiple of their happy hour cocktails and they were all very good. I also enjoyed their happy hour menu including fish tacos and fried calamari. Yum! The food was pretty good except for the cheese balls. These were still mildly cold and I am assuming it is because they were fried at a high temperature for not enough time. Other than that, everything else was very good.   I also really enjoyed the atmosphere this place has. They had a live musician who played great songs. He handed out a music sheet with all of the songs so that we could give suggestions.   Overall great place to come with a friend and enjoy good food and cocktails. I am def planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"I come here nearly every weekend with my boyfriend, friends and bring family in when they visit from out of town. We have been coming for over a year now and love it!   Part of the reason we love it SO much is because of the BEST server I've ever had eating out, Brittney. Brittney is always working brunch and handles the amounts of tables she has (sometimes she is the only server) amazingly well and ensures everyone is not only taken care of but having a good time. Brittney is extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu and is very prompt when keeping your mimosa, sangria or Bloody Mary full. You never have to track her down or ask, she's always on top of things!   This is our favorite spot for not only brunch but dinner too. Amazing food, drinks & staff but we wouldn't be coming back every week if it weren't for Brittney!"}
{"text":"The mac n cheese with duck was incredible, came when the special was grouper, n that was well worth the $26 it cost. Paul our server was great, answered every question we had n gave us some great recommendations. Definitely worth coming back to"}
{"text":"Had Christmas Day dinner here and the food was phenomenal. My Father got the special which was prime rib so smooth and delicious it melted in my mouth like butter. I had the roast chicken whose sweet and spicy crust was the perfect pairing for the glazed carrots and tender new potatoes. Why have I never come before? Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Whist is a great hang! Not too loud. Great spot for a fun hang or a quick business meeting. The environment is great. Super clean and great staff. I've never had issues with service or timeliness. Always spot on.  Food and drinks are great. Very unique drinks and great taste. Pretty full size menu. Great options.   I will say every time I'm at the Whist I'm freezing. The AC definitely works!   Make sure to grab a couch seat. They are the best. Very comfortable!"}
{"text":"Positives -  - Layed back, casual and intimate atmosphere - more upscale bar compared to Due and Proper next door - 2 happy hour times Monday - Friday with fair quality options and prices - Live music Friday and Saturday nights - noise level is low enough for quality conversation - larger bar than next door, with plenty of walking room so that yuou are not brushing up against others - indoor and outdoor seating  Negative  - bit higher prices for the quality of the alcohol provided if not on happy hour - not too conducive to large groups for seating unless at the bar  Neutral - gaming all across the bar (This Could Be positive or negative, depending on your preferences.  Happy hour (see pictures for details) Monday thru Friday  3:00 PM - 7:00 PM and 12 AM - 3:00 AM Drinks:  $4 Select Beers and Well Drinks $5 Wines by the Glass and Specialty Cocktails $3 Coors light draft Food: $3-$6 Appetizer Menu  Nice, layed back atmosphere, large bar, live music Friday and Saturday nights. According to the bartender they are connected to the Due and Proper. The atmosphere is more upscale compared to Due and Proper, catering to an older, more mature crowd I would say. The square footage is also double or triple the size of Due and Proper. The noise level is lower, supporting better conversation than next door. This bar has more tables, of which are smaller in size predominantly. This promotes smaller, more intimate groups of 2-4. They have a brunch that is extremely popular, especially on Sundays. The menus is $$, everything but the salad ($8-9) are in the low teens in price. Matt the bartender is very personable and knowledge of the menu. A+ to him."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch in an effort to support small local businesses and we will definitely be back! We sat at the bar and were served immediately. I asked about the kitchen accommodating my dairy allergy, and the server went back to the kitchen and asked what they could do. I was served a delicious vegetable burrito and I was not made to feel like I was putting them out (which happens sometimes). My husband got a great meal. It was fun, and they had a live band playing that wasn't too loud or distracting. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off we get there hostess was no where to be found but what's worse is at least 3 employees looked at us and no greeting ! The food was super good, I ordered the crabby in the morning being however  the service needs some work ! Once we received drinks and food no one came  back for refills and some the employees are quite full of themselves if you ask for anything . The food is good but the service brings it down for sure , they think their a little too big for their britches !"}
{"text":"We went for brunch yesterday and ordered the unlimited drinks.  It would have been a good deal if we actually received drinks in a decent time frame...but that was not the case (even though we were the only people in the dining room and there were multiple staff standing around talking).  At some point, when our original waitress left, we were completely ignored, so we ended up leaving and going to a different bar in the district.    The food was decent, but a little over-priced for what we received."}
{"text":"This review is for dining outside. We came in on a slow empty Saturday afternoon. The service was really slow and we were never checked in on or anything. They have these awesome goblet things outside by THEYRE DIRTY and covered with pollen....and with the plates like this place is so unsanitary and doesn't clean or replace anything. There was a spider inside my silverware that made me lose my appetite. The lady wouldn't let us sit in a comfier roomier section because we didn't have enough people.. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE!!!!! WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE. We were put in a lame corner with a umbrella blocking everything and then another server came by to move that umbrella.   Food- The wedge salad is the best salad ever. The presentation is awesome and it was sooo good. The tuna bites are a joke... It's like one small piece of ahi sliced into bitsy 6 pieces with a fancy squirt of spicy mayo....LOL how is that an appetizer. The southwest salad is really spicy but it has an over abundance of jalapeños that it was inedible. The carpaccio was awesome! It was so goooood and perfect.  Alcohol-the alcohol was soooo good!!! I recommend their drinks for sure :)"}
{"text":"We went for brunch today. Started slowly because a group of 12 or 14 women were paying their bill separately. After that the service was perfect. Nice atmosphere, the food was A-May-Zing. Mrs had the Mac-n-Cheese omelette and I the Duck Hash.  Both delicious. Drinks on point."}
{"text":"When you make a reservation arriving at 6 for 8 for a Birthday Celebration and they seat you on the side where they only have small round cocktail tables and they have pushed two together, it's a sign!  Better off leaving.  The other side of the room which is better fit for dining is wide open, only two tables of two are seated.  There is several long tables against the wall that would have been perfect for a party of eight.  (During our entire visit no one sat there) We are seated for a good 15 minutes then this girl comes over in a white causal top, a dark sports bra underneath with blue jeans cuffed up and pink tennis shoes.  Wait I know this is an eclectic place but the other server has on a white skirt and a teal off the shoulder top I feel like we are on candid camera.  She fills everyone's water and says she will be back to take our order.  As we watch her fill the four top next to us we are all confused.  She returns for our drink order.  I order mine in a tall glass.  Fail, I get a short glass.   She drops off drinks and says she will return for our order.  We wait..... my sister goes to the bar and orders appetizers for the table and pays separate.  Waitress returns, \"ok I'm ready now, I'll start here\".  As she is taking the order one of the appetizers come out.  Ten minutes go by and another one comes out, we order another round.  Again I request a tall glass he response was \" oh yhea that's right you ordered that last time, I forgot\".  We are thinking maybe this is her first day, other people are bringing food out placing it in front of the wrong people.  The girl from the other side of the room came over to help clear the appetizer plates and dropped two forks and two different times off of the plates on to the table.  This was like a joke!  Food is all delivered and one person doesn't have anything in front of her.  The servers don't realize and leave.  We wait and final flag down the waitress and she says \"oh, it will probably take like 15 minutes\". We looked at her \" I didn't put it in, sorry\". There must be cameras rolling this is just not funny.  Understand the place is not busy!  You got a guy looks like he must be management in a baseball cap on the computer at the end of the bar very casual but not helping in any of this.  Our waitress is behind the bar opening a bottle of wine confusing because there is baseball cap standing there and a female bartender at the other end of the bar doing nothing. Food was not good!  I have eaten there dozens of times and the polenta was dry and hard, the meat in the charcuterie had brown on the edges.  The two orders of risotto looked and tasted completely different.  The chicken piccata was over cooked and dry laid on top of the pasta.  She simply just pushed it aside it was inedible.  There was no lemon sauce or capers.  Just an over cooked battered chicken breast that had been flattened.  The wedge salad wasn't a wedge at all it was a couple of chopped mounds of lettuce.  Maybe it was the cooks first day as well.  Waitress never asked if there was something wrong just asked if we needed boxes.  We left a nice tip in hopes that she could buy an outfit that would be suited for the ambience of this place and hopefully she would conduct herself more professional. On a side note the place needs a little Maintence.  Faucets are coming out of the wall in the ladies bathroom... We will not be returning."}
{"text":"His place has completely gone down hill. I hardly ever write negative reviews and have been going here since it was Kennedys back in 2005. We got there at 12:15 for our reservation and once seated, I had to flag someone down at 12:30 just for a glass of water. Then once the server came over, he didn't write down our Order and got it wrong. I will not be coming back. Good luck if you eat here."}
{"text":"Cool hang spot! Good breakfast and lunch, good bloodies and mimosas! Also the pretzel sticks are a must!"}
{"text":"3rd time here and it was as good as the 1st.  Crab Benedict was perfect.  Service was friendly and on top of everything."}
{"text":"Artsy atmosphere. Excellent service. Exceptional food. One of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. Even better than Lucille's across the way."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials. The lobster bisque was not good. There's no lobster in it. It mostly tasted like brandy and Worcestershire sauce. The risotto was too salty. Chicken sliders and calamari were good. Service and atmosphere were good. Rosemary's Baby (drink) and red blend (wine) were good."}
{"text":"Came here twice now within a week... Love the atmosphere and the decor. Service was excellent, staff was super nice and Scott was amazing!!!! Will definitely come back whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I liked this place.  The decor is fab, the food is good, the PROBLEM is the LOUD MUSIC.  This place is too small for the type of music they hire there.  We couldn't hear ourselves and the waiters couldn't hear us either.  It was a strain to socialize.  so maybe we were there on a day they hired a loud band or maybe that's the same band they always hire, but it ruined the experience  for us."}
{"text":"My wife and I had meet a couple finds over here to rock a brunch for our anniversary and listen to Stevenson Brooks play and it was an amazing time. We all had did the unlimited mimosas and we had breakfast as well. I do not have enough good things to say about our experience. The wait staff was amazing. The waitress overherd it was our anniversary and she brought us a couple drinks and congragulated us which was really cool. The restaurant has a great feel. The food was amazing I had the biscuits and gravy it was great it was a chorizo gravy and it was awesome can't wait to go back. We all shared the crab cake which was really good as well trust me check it out!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Sat outside on a nice spring evening. Large tables with couch seating. Inside was nice decor. Good date place but need to work on the food. Service was good. Ordered the bacon wrapped dates.  Sent back because the bacon was burnt.  The deviled eggs were odd tasting.  Not sure how you wrong with a deviled egg. The nachos were bland and had the fake cheese. The pork and chicken tacos were dry and needed something. Calamari so,so.  Every once in a while you'd get a breaded soggy piece.  Happy hour drinks weren't even good.  A drink with lavender.  Can't remember name but it was like I was drinking my massage.  Too much lavender. The sangria was overly sweet. All I know is that the five of us each had only had one drink, each different and none were great."}
{"text":"I'd give 10 stars if possible! We celebrated with brunch at Whist following the adoption hearing of our daughter yesterday. The compassionate staff and excellent food at Whist has made one of our families most memorable days even more extraordinary. We arrived to a pre-set table, just for our group, and a wonderfully warm reception. Water & coffee cups stayed full, dishes we intended to share came cut and generously portioned, and suggestions for food choices were spot on. Both Melissa and Rob made intentional efforts to care for our party and anticipate our needs. They truly went above and beyond to make a special day MORE special. We are floored, as are our friends and family that were in attendance, at the customer service we received. We enjoyed Whist's Happy Hour and menu before; now, having experienced their labor to make us feel so cared for, I appreciate why this restaurant's atmosphere is so fantastic. Round of applause for this establishment and it's top-notch staff!! Thank you again, Rob, Melissa, and kitchen staff. We are pleased that you are forever a part of our families memory!"}
{"text":"I've been to Whist four or five times now. I keep coming back because I love the decor and ambiance. I also appreciate the brunch menu and that it's a true brunch feel. I particularly like the biscuits and jam... The seasonal jam is delightful! I've always had good service with really friendly waitresses. However, I've had the same hostess every time, and she is less than pleasant. I also prefer going when there isn't live music. It's not that the music is bad, it's just very loud and makes conversation difficult, which is unfortunate because that's usually why I want to go to brunch in the first place. I'll probably keep going because I haven't found any other brunch places in Henderson I like, but there could be some improvement to make the experience really great."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails. I especially like the \"who dun it\" for its spicy complexity and tequila. I just asked for the swapped Gin for their house made spicy tequila for their South India House. It's wonderful, I'm so glad they were comfortable customizing their regular cocktail."}
{"text":"Had Easter brunch with family.  Five of us each ordered something different.  Sweet Ricotta Crepes with Blackberries and Strawberries for me (awesome), Bacon Pancakes for our granddaughter (she devoured them), Walnut French Toast for my daughter (huge portion and delicious) Chorizo Sopas for our son-in-law (he practically licked the plate).  Hubby had a classic breakfast, eggs and bacon but it was good enough that he asked me what the dinner menu consisted of.  We will definitely go for dinner.  The restaurant is lovely, the wait staff friendly and efficient and the chef went table to table to inquire about the quality of food.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a review of a specific experience at Whilst. I have been coming here for brunch and Happy Hour alot since moving here from LA and have had amazing service and food. Britney and Joe are awesome servers and the coffee cake is a must try and will change your life! BUT (and I have a big butt) I came in for dessert at 11pm one night and it wasnt the greatest experience. The bar staff were just laissez faire and disinterested in anything. I ordered the seasonal cobbler and nobody seemed to know what kind of fruit was going to be in it. So surprise! It was peach. Which is what I was hoping for but that was the only good thing. It was overly sugary sweet. No caramel sauce as described in menu and the vanilla gelato tasted worse than month old cheap freezer burned vanilla ice cream. The cobbler sat in the window for awhile because when I did receive it, it was a melted soupy mess. All in all not a good experience. I really like Whilst for their food but will not be ordering dessert here for awhile or coming in late."}
{"text":"Came here after our schools graduation to have a wind down cocktail. There were about 5 people at the bar. One male bartender and one female. The male bartender was making drinks the female just standing there.. Took her about 10 min to say anything to us.  Ordered drinks I had a glass of Pinot Giorgio my friend had a cocktail.  Hers was decent I was poured warm wine into a cold glass! Yuck... The girl never returned to us. She was useless and lacking any personality.  Thankfully the male started to help us. Not sure I would go back"}
{"text":"Made a reservation a week in advance for party of 13 with 2 high hairs for Sunday brunch. Get there and we are sitting outside. The hostess said it wouldn't be too hot because the umbrellas would block the sun. So we stuff ourselves into the booth and they set up one umbrella to block the sun. It blocked the sun for about 4 people. Tried to get another one, but they were either being used or broken. They serve this little coffee cake with blueberry muffin, one they serve for a party of 13. We ask for a couple more. The waitress brings out one more and says she has to charge $8 for any additional. If a party of two is getting one, a party of 13 should at least get 6.  Any-who, we order a couple French toasts, bacon pancakes, the chorizo frittata, eggs, bacon, and crab Benedict. The coffee had grounds in it. Everything was just ok. Very uncomfortable to eat when the sun is beating down on you. Service was just ok as well. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up coming here to try out their brunch! I wanted to sit in the lounge area being that we're here to catch up with each other over some delicious food.  The place wasn't super busy but there was a good amount of people in there for being in the afternoon especially for brunch.  The outside patio looked really cute, but it was a little too chilly to eat outside. It's very spacious, we were near a door so we caught a little of the outdoor light as well.   I originally wanted to order the crab hash brown but, our server said it was sold out after. So I decided to try the french toastowitz which sounded delicious!  About 5 minutes later he did come back to let me know that they weren't out of the crab hash, so I ended up getting that with the french toast to share. My friend ordered the Croque Madame also.  To be honest, I didn't pay attention to how long the food took cause we're chatting amongst each other. Food came and everything was delicious. The french toastowitz was a lot bigger than we thought but it def was enough for the both of us to share!    The crab hash brown was ok, it wasn't anything extremely different but it did have its own kick to it. The french toast was delicious even with the frangelico syrup. The Croque my friend ordered was good too! **i ordered another french toastowitz to go for my husband only to find a hair in the fruit on top of the french toast :( ***"}
{"text":"I visited Whist when i was back home for my bday last month. I met some friends over there and we stayed a few hours and had dinner and drinks. The service was phenomenal and the food was really good. Great atmosphere except for the gossipy hens behind us but that is everywhere you go. HAHA.  I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Since the new owners have taken over the food has already gone downhill and is not good.  They also took some of the best things off the menu.  I guess I'll have to find a new happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Items Selected: French Onion Soup - Sweet Onion, Gruyere, Crouton Mac and Cheese Omelet - Swiss, Cheddar, Elbow Macaroni with Fruit Pretzel Sticks - Cheese sauce, peanut butter, mustard Fresh Made Biscuits and Daily Strawberry Jam Blueberry Muffins and Raspberry Coffee Cake Peanut Butter Pancakes - Toasted Nuts, Peanut Butter Sauce French Toastowitz - Challah Bread, Frangelico Bourbon, Maple Syrup White Chocolate and Walnut French Toast - 'maple syrup...if needed'  Serving as a last-minute substitution when plans for Green Valley Ranch's new Pizza Rock fell through it was admittedly not my first visit to Whist Stove & Spirits on Saturday, but having walked out due to truly disastrous customer service without tasting a single thing that first time around it seemed only fair to actually sit down to a proper meal this time, the waitstaff still spotty at times but the cuisine proving far better than any of us had anticipated at a pricepoint that puts many Las Vegas Boulevard brunches to shame.  Owned by the group behind Park on Fremont, but far larger in size with an outdoor patio that was completely full on our noon arrival, Whist features a similar feel to the overhyped and underwhelming DTLV spot largely as a result of décor but with both lunch and brunch menus available on weekends from 10a-4p one would be hard pressed to find any similarity between the two as it relates to food, an actual Chef at Whist infusing the menu with quality to match creativity while service proves informed enough, though perhaps stretched a bit thin.  Opting to order in two courses, a quartet arriving at each as a result of the complimentary muffins and coffee cake being forgotten as the meal began, round one of the experience was a mix of plates from both the lunch and brunch menu and although opinions on the subtle Mac and Cheese Omelet as well as the crock of surprisingly vegetal French Onion soup ranged from 'delicious, great texture' to 'odd, but not in a bad way' not a single word short of praise was due for the pitch-perfect pretzel sticks with cheese fondue and fresh-ground peanut butter nor the trio of buttermilk biscuits with house-made jam, the latter particularly impressive in a city where good biscuits are finally starting to become a 'thing.'  With the missing muffin basket issue remedied by the General Manager, who later brought the chef by to say hello, those interested in excellent coffee cake would be well advised to make sure that they are not shorted of the brunch-only gift, and yet as good as this was it was much to the surprise of everyone at the table that actual menu items proved even better, the substantial stack of pancakes absolutely riddled with peanut butter while both styles of French Toast offered up entirely different, yet equally well crafted, experiences - the chocolate imbued bread of the light and crispy variety while challah was dense with custard beneath roasted fruits and boozy notes minimizing the need for slightly-better-than-average pseudo-syrup to a light drizzle.  Sometimes a backhanded compliment, but in this case a well intended bit of praise, Whist Stove & Spirits is far better than it 'needs' to be and while a few more servers plus a bit more attention to details like refills, syrup, and expediting could really make a difference the concept is already far better developed than the disastrous Park on Fremont 'brunch' with a price that more than justifies getting off the strip for good food in a space every bit as splashy as those charging twice the price."}
{"text":"I had an awesome lunch business lunch. The bacon wrapped dates were freaking awesome!!! They were even better than Fire Fly.  I recommend this place for lunch, happy hour and dinner.  They do have one amazing burger!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new establishment as we headed for the airport to start our vacation. We had eyed this establishment from another and decided to give it a try. We began our lunch with banana muffins which were warm, moist and tasty. They have a brunch menu with bottomless mimosas, if that is your thing, but we opted for the regular lunch menu that is diverse with soups, salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes.  We decided on the pulled pork sandwich which has a spicy kick that is phenomenal! I had the beef dip which I found to be far better than those that taste mass produced and \"artificial\" at other establishments. It is served on a soft pretzel roll and is moist and flavorful. We saved half of our sandwiches for the long plane ride and they were even good cold! The sweet potato fries are to die for, however they are garnished with bacon, so be mindful!  We received outstanding service from Brittney and Emmanuel; even though there was a wait time on a busy Saturday afternoon, they were friendly and attentive,  We returned for a second visit yesterday, post vacation and received the same friendly, attentive service by Brittney and Emmanuel and great, consistent food.   Needless to say, it has already become a  favorite! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly. Lots of specialty drinks to choose from. Just stopped in for a drink and made a new friend while we were there. Rachael is the best. Can't wait to come back and try the food. Love the decor. Reminds me of a place we enjoyed  in Dublin Ireland."}
{"text":"Went here to hear a friend sing. A one man band. His name is Weiss and he's a terrific singer with range of songs from country to rock. It's a cool 24 hour bar with happy hour cocktails that were pretty good. I would definitely go back to chill again when there's a live band playing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this cute spot for brunch & $18 bottomless mimosas -- 2 hour limit, I believe. But I'd have to admit, I'm not a big fan of mimosas -- or alcohol for that matter. So I'll take my mimosa with exxxxxtra OJ (lol #noshame). I tried tho, I really tried.   Aside from the mimosas, let's talk about the food because it was delicious! I order the crab cake hash brown with an egg over medium on top. Real crab meat and the hash brown was a potato shaped into a patty. Yum! I also had a couple bites of my friends' mac and cheese omelette (exactly what it sounds like) & white chocolate & walnut French toast. All the food was delicious!! I'd highly recommend the French toast. It wasn't too sweet but there was a lot of flavor, nothing too overwhelming!   I almost gave 5 stars, but the service could have been a little better. We were checked on a couple times, and refills came in a timely matter. But when it came to our checks...we were definitely ready for it: leftovers all boxed up, all of us desperately looking around to find our waiter -- or anyone, really -- to ask for our check. He finally came and dropped off our checks but then we had to find him again to give him our payments. We were all getting pretty antsy...  Overall: good experience. There was a live band playing inside the restaurant (sit outside if the weather permits, it's beautiful!) So it was a nice, relaxing brunch on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"This place can be so much better if the service and the energy from the staff brings more comfort to its patrons.   On the outside of the restaurant, there seems to be no main entrance that would invite customers in. There is a little gate right at the front yet it's not the actual entrance and the actual entrance looks like the back doors as there is no sign or 'hint' that it's an entrance.   As my party and I came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, the hostess looked bored and uninterested as we entered. There was the usual 'how may I help you' and 'how many people are in your party?'; but there was no friendly smile at all. I felt uncomfortable right away walking to the table. Our waitress came to take our drink orders and she was nice but it didn't feel genuine, it was so scripted. I was already annoyed with the hostess as she is the first person you see entering a restaurant and she sets up the mood for the rest of the time you're there.   The decor was nice and the menu looked interesting. We ordered only appetizers as we all agreed that we would rather not have lunch here since the place made us feel so unwanted. We ordered the oxtail tacos, calamari and sweet potato fries. The oxtail tacos and sweet potatoes was good but the calamari was not crispy (felt undercooked and mushy) and it wasn't seasoned at all. I also ordered their special cocktail which I cannot remember the name but it's was too sweet, it was strong though, so that was good.  I just felt bad for the place that because it could do so much better but the mood that was set by the staff just didn't seem to help the place. The place was very empty, there was two people at the bar and a table of 8 people next to us and that was it. I wouldn't come back again as there are so many restaurants out there that offers much better service and ambiance for the patrons."}
{"text":"Ok let's start by saying our server was more than understanding of our visit and we thank her for that. (Also the only reason we give this place 2 stars) With that I'll go straight to the food. In one word underwhelming...  our lobster bisque  was grainy and should have been passed through a fine strainer. Ravioli came out cold .  We also order a cheese plate which tasted worse than grocery store cheese. Stale. Terrible. Side of cauliflower... Stale. Not good. Calamari... overcooked ... not good. Baked Brie... could have made at home... not good. All in all unless your coming for beer and wine save yourself the time."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to try out WSS on a visit for parents night out at the District.  Atmosphere: i love the decor of both Due and Proper and WSS. The owners took the time to be sure there was a distinct feel and vibe to both places so that they seemed like sisters but not twins. The classic dinnerware and art makes you feel like you're outside of Henderson for even a dinners worth of time.  Service: the hostess and server were both very friendly. While we sat down pretty quickly we did have to keep finding someone for a menu or a drink or more water. This is the main reason for the 4 and not 5 stars that WSS has she potential for.  Food: the food was amazing! I had their swordfish special with a fresh salad and a side of sweet potato mashed potatoes. My husband had the ox tail tacos which he loved. We had the calamari for an app and were super happy with that. A friend tried their seared ahi tuna and we argued over which dish was better - nothing super violent though.   We've heard their brunch is amazing and definitely love the fact they're so close to home so we can come back!"}
{"text":"pro's: our server Andy was very nice and attentive. the inside of the restaurant is breathtaking: everything was luxurious, nice, and opulent. I got three small plates for $20 which was a fair amount of food.  con's: the food was just okay. but it wasn't very expensive and it seemed to be higher quality bar food... and one of my plates came out kind of cold. my colleague did not like her soup.   we were also the only ones in there which was kind of surprising. this seems to be a more romantic dinner/drinking location versus an early lunch but i would go back."}
{"text":"Whist's  Sunday brunch is off the hook good!  It ain't the cheapest in town, but then again you aren't likely to find one of the best croque madames on the planet at Dennys...from the bottomless mimosas and the bloody mary bar to really unique and amazingly good dishes like the aforementioned croque madame to their version of eggs Benedict with pork belly instead of canadian bacon this is not your usual Sunday brunch!  Whist is already edgy and way cool for dinner, but with Saturday and Sunday brunch from 10-4, I could seriously camp out there for the weekend.  Our waitress Lisa was awesome, the vibe is laid back and again the food was off the hook good!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night and I wasn't too impressed. I ordered two different martinis and then both were nasty. When you order a pricey drink and it is nasty that can be very disappointing. The customer service was not so great either. Our waiter was kind of a jerk. My friend orders the bacon wrapped dates and she asked for no jalapeño sauce and when the dish was brought out it had the jalapeño pesto sauce on it. Instead of taking the dish back he tried to push her to just eat the sauce. I ordered lobster bisque and it was gross. Very bland flavors. I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I wish there were half star for reviews. I would give Whist 3.5 stars. My husband and I decided to come here for happy hour, a friend of mine was raving about this place. We arrived at around 6 pm (happy hour from 5-7 pm) and it was not busy. We ordered a beer, chardonnay, and their cocktail called refresher, which was so refreshing and light! I wish I opted out from getting the wine. $4 beer, $5 wine/cocktails. The beer was room temp, they may have just changed the keg but my husband drank it anyway.   We also tried the cheese balls (OMG! You have to try this!). It's 3 cheeses with spinach and hollandaise, I would've ordered like 4 more servings if I knew I wouldn't get fat from it. Probably the best thing there and it was $6 on the happy hour menu. We also got two chicken street tacos for $4--it was good but not memorable. The deviled eggs was either $4-$5 and it came out with 4 pieces which were very pretty and according to my husband \"pretty good.\" I wish I could've tried it, but I could have gone into anaphylactic shock. We also ordered off of the happy hour menu, which was the beef carpaccio/beef tartare for about $17. I wasn't impressed. When I have beef carpaccio anywhere, I compare it to the one from brio which gives you x3 times more for like $5 less. I guess the beef tartare should make up for the lack of carpaccio, but it wasn't seasoned well...the meat was room temp and maybe I expected too much but I wish it was better.   Overall, the waitress was really nice. The food was good. The ambiance is VERY VERY pretty. I'm surprised it's 24-hour gaming. It's too pretty of a place to be compared to like a PT's or Sierra Gold. I know there is late night happy hour too, but I did not catch the time. I would consider having a baby shower/bridal shower here, esp for like a happy hour time. I don't know if I would come back for a full dinner here, but happy hour was great!"}
{"text":"Came in for some ciders and beers, with the 115° heat. Sat at the bar, they were very attentive and fast! EXTREMELY beautiful and Victorian inside. I have to say, that was the best damn cider I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch due to a good friend's recommendation during work hours. Glad we stopped by. The place was pretty slow for a Monday at around 11:30am, and what a shame. What a jewel!  We both liked because it reminded us of California. She frequents LA and I both LA and Palm Springs, and it seems like a place you'd find in those cities. We'd bring our friends from California here in a heartbeat.  We both ordered the Southwest Wrap and it was delish! I asked for a side of ranch for my perfectly seasoned fries and was treated to their own house chipotle style. It was amazing! I felt guilty eating it because it was so rich, but it was so good!  I truly hope this place is hopping during evening hours and the weekends. It's the old Prisidio for those who remember that place. Give it a shot. I plan to come back and test the other things on the menu, especially during evening hours. The service was spectacular and our server was a gem. Cheers, my friends!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a more in depth review but after being here at 2:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday and given a menu that has literally 1 soup, maybe 5 salads and about 5 sandwiches I can't say much. Menu is a joke, only one other table and it took at least 15 minutes to bring a salad I'm walking out without any food. What a joke.  Update- As I was walking out they brought my salad, shoulda kept walking. No.... Shoulda ran. The western salad was leafs of lettuce, tiny tomato and a couple slivers of jalapeños and some over cooked chicken jerky. There was virtually no dressing. Again what a joke.   The two people that I was with ordered a burger medium which came very rare and the other ordered the soup which was corn chowder with jalapeño. It was milk with about 3 kernels of corn and zero jalapeño and she ordered the ham and cheese sandwich. Again... What a joke."}
{"text":"Ambiente is nice, food is OK for the money. Service is clearly sub-par. We asked for bread and had to hear that they only serve it on request. So why didn't they ask us prior to bringing our appetizer? So they brought the bread after serving the entree. And they did the worst thing any restaurant can do: bring the entree while we were in the midst of eating our appetizers. This is simply inexcusable so we will not go there again."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas are always awesome! They were great....fantastic actually! But how can you mess that up?? You can't! So we ordered 6 dishes for brunch, including apps and only 1 was good. It was actually delicious!! Thick cut bacon. Again, how do you mess that up?? All the other dishes were gross. No seasoning, over cooked eggs, undercooked eggs, just not good at all. And the service wasn't good! Our waitress didn't even say thank you when she picked up the check with. 20% tip. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"This is becoming my favorite breakfast and lunch venue in Henderson!  The ambiance is wonderful and Chef Shelly is AMAZING!  Love the Southwest wrap & the fried chicken & waffles and the breakfast burritos are fabulous on the brunch menu!    This is a great place to have meetings and enjoy a good meal.  It's not loud like a typical breakfast joint and the place has characters.  Service is always great -- lately, it's been Jorge -- and he's attentive yet not intrusive.  :-)"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for I guess. Ordered the special of 1lb Alaskan king crab steamed and glass of wine. Wine was poured heavy and a nice Pinot Grigio while playing gambling video at bar however the crabs were small, a fight to eat. Dry and tasteless. Took the manager forever to come over so by the time she got there (30minutes) we were starving so ate them. She kept asking what we wanted and honestly what do you say after you've eaten most of them waiting so she literally just walked away. She would have been better never coming over. Not a customer service personality. Understand the have bottomless mimosas I'd return for that and sit on outside deck. Otherwise you'll leave crabby."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.   Decor is very retro, and extremely cool.  They offer a brunch menu until 4pm, and tons of unique offerings.  Everyone at our table loved our selection.   Service was friendly, but a bit slow.  We had to ask another servier for our check, and we still never saw our original server again.   Were it not for the slow service at the end (rest of service was fine), I would have done 5 stars.   We will certainly return."}
{"text":"We experienced overpriced and underwhelming entrees that included the smallest portioned and most watery Seafood Rissoto with the tiniest of muscles and clams we've ever encountered. The Sea Bass was dominated by the taste of olive oil, although a quality piece of fish, and was too small for the price. Our appetizers, Tomato salad and Endive and Beets salad, were pretty good - especially the former. It took too long for entres to arrive while we had to remind the server about our second and side dish. Don't expect to see a wide beer selection. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I met a friend here last night to indulge in a little happy hour and dinner before we caught a movie. The place overall was good and you can definitely tell its under the same scheme and management as commonwealth, park, etc.   I had their burger which was really good! Perfectly cooked and fries were decent. My friend order their ravioli; it was presented well and looked pretty good. Big thing here is that my friend and I split the Mac and cheese with Duck in it! A tad greasy but holy crap make sure to get it.   Overall tho good place, hip a bit pricy for main courses but a nice spot for sure! I'll be returning for happy hour for sure! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party. I wasn't sure how it was going to be. When I walked in I immediately noticed that the place was fun and cool.  With the humorous paintings on the walls and the nice vibe I was intirigued.    I ordered a gin and tonic. It was perfect.  The bartender was very nice and the price was average.    There was a live guitarist which was great!   I didn't eat but the food certainly looked good. I would definitely recommend this place and will most likely be coming back."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 22 ppl but we did not know until we got there that service would be lousy. We checked the reviews and my family said this should be ok looks like a great place and listen to some music. However, when we got there we did not know the service would be lousy and the wait was going to be that long especially our waiter whom we did not get his name, working Sunday, January 28, got there around 11:15am and we don't care who he is anymore. I only remember he is Hispanic, short and dark guy.   He got our waters, coffee, soft drinks, tea etc. Then we noticed that it was taking awhile and we know and understand that we are a big group and he was servicing other tables and customers but as time goes by he should have gotten our orders the moment he delivered our coffee, waters etc. He was doing something else maybe who knows but it really took awhile. We have kids who were hungry. It was almost 12 noon that our orders were taken. After that of course we have to wait another 30 mins for all the food to arrive. The waiter did not even go to our table and see how was everything and if are orders are okay. There is one order that my sister NEVER got and the waiter NEVER attempted to follow-up at all. We just told the other waitress to cancel the order and to make sure we were not charged. We got out of the restaurant almost 2pm!!!!   Never again will I go back to this place , wish the review has no star  to give...just gave one star. Our waiter should have basic training skills on big groups like ours. We were hesitant to talk to a manager but no one cares anyways!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just visited this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. We are new to this neighborhood . We loved the ambience and decor. Very eclectic and romantic. They have live music on Saturday night., which is a plus. They have unique cocktails which I liked a lot. Tried the refresher cocktail , yum! My husband had German beer, white ale something... He said it was delicious! We have appetizers like the Spanish octopus and and truffle tots. - yum."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times should have written a review sooner.  Day time with Melissa is the best.  She always knows what food to recommend and what drinks to serve.  Great food and wine pairing. That's a hard combo to find early in the day.  She keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"The vibe here is quaint but very posh. The menu is worded in such a way that everything sounds unique and delicious. Portion sizes vary but I feel like you get what you pay more. Went on a Sunday and didn't have to fight for an outside seat for brunch. Highly recommend and will be returning. The hostesses are super welcoming and are very helpful!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place a 1 star as its not deserved but Yelp does not give a no star option. I was at brunch with my boyfriend and after being seated had to get the hostess to get a sever after waiting a ridiculous amount of time without even water. Like other reviews I did see Server's sitting with friends and just \"hanging out\" instead of working . We noticed the group next to us was already far beyond over served and actually falling down on to the floor and each other. While waiting for our first drink which took over an hour the table next to us received no less than 20 of their bottomless drinks while we could not get a second drink. During the time there for brunch the table dos everything from scream non stop at the top of their lungs to punch the back of patrons chairs and take articles of clothing off while many patrons looked on in disgust and several were filming the situation as it was so outrageous. The server continued to bring them handfuls of shots without mixers. I told my server twice that they were going to get in the road and kill someone and that the females were unable to stand or reason any longer. He said that there was nothing that could be done although they had been kicked out before. They yelled vulgarities in front of children , racial slurs and harassed everyone patron near them. I asked for the manager and he said he would take care of it but did not. They continued to chug straight vodka from full glasses and after seeing that I had spoken to the manager started threatening to punch me and everyone else in the face and stood up and made fun of my disability publicly. We could not get a check so we could not leave. I got the manager and the manager publicly shamed me , blamed me for complaining and threw myself and my boyfriend out of the restaurant , while allowing the other party to stay and threaten guests. This place needs to be closed. I have never seen a more incompetent and aggressive staff anywhere in my life. Don't rush it for basic and overpriced food and drinks"}
{"text":"Met up with a group of friends here for Saturday brunch and had a better than expected experience. I'm typically not a fan of brunch because often times I find it overpriced for fare that can usually be made easily at home for much cheaper. But it wasn't too bad. The prices are still steep in my opinion, but again I am especially biased when it comes to brunch. I tried the croque madame (a fancy take on ham, egg, cheese sandwich) and french toast sandwich (loads of turkey and ham, veggies, avocado, scrambled egg sandwiched between 2 slices of french toasts, 1 with an egg in the middle like eggs in a basket). Both were delicious. And both were $13.25. While I don't find it worth $13.25, I wouldn't mind coming back with friends who want brunch. Whist even gives you complementary blueberry muffins while you wait for your food. They are light, fluffy, and fresh, served with butter. As silly as it sounds, I also really like their cups that they use for water; they look like little shimmering chalices. Overall, I wouldn't choose to come back often, but I wouldn't mind coming back with a group of friends who are desiring brunch specifically."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife for lunch. It was delicious. I ordered the crispy lobster and my wife ordered the steak and fries. Everything was cooked perfectly and the atmosphere of the place was peaceful too. I came on a Thursday afternoon, mind you. The staff was courteous as well."}
{"text":"Had a great time here tossing back more then a few martinis.  The food was all local which the flavors reflected.  We had the cheese plate which was really great.  It was not nearly as busy I would have expected.  After having spent a few hours there this may be a place that is being overlooked by passerby's.  But the Floyd and Manny fight was underway so maybe that was it.    Staff was friendly, bartenders know what they are doing, and the food was good.    Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Popped into Whist Stove & Spirits to have an after dinner drink last night. The place was busy, but not too busy. The patio was full and the main bar was also hoppin. So we found space at their cool long high top communal tables. I tried a drink called \"Aunt Ruby's Slippers\" WOW! Fantastic! I could drink an entire pitcher of those darn things! Seriously. Whoever came up with this cocktail did a great job.  My guy had a nice glass of Prisoner. And, well, it's Prisoner. So it was very good. Nice to see you can come into a place for a fancy cocktail, yet still find really nice wine options."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe that we haven't frequented this place more often... Bottomless mimosas were perfect for our hungover crew, and the food was top notch! They had a live band and all the football games on too! The vibe and ambiance were energetic and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for these two (Due & Proper next door) new establishments ever since the previous ones (Al's Garage and Presidio) closed!   Whist Stove is a name that will take me a while for it to roll off my tongue, but I guess that's not a true issue. Owned by the creators of Commonwealth, Park, and BLVD Cocktail, you should expect the same environment and trendy ambiance: eye-catching paintings, chandeliers galore, specialty drinks, price, etc.   We came just to sample some drinks and have a look at the menu. Friends and I ordered a round: two craft beers, specialty cocktail of whiskey, and an old fashion... These took forever and a day to come out when the staff to customer ratio was pretty fair. The craft beer menu is nice, also for the fact that the crafts are on draft as opposed to just a bottle. The boys seemed to enjoy their whiskey drinks, heavy pourers those bartenders...  We decided to try out an appetizer, hush puppies with jalapeño jelly. They were delicious and the jelly was something to order just on the side for maybe a burger? We were a group of 4 and had to ask for place settings, but then never given plates. So yes, a shared appetizer, but I think a plate or two would have been appropriate.   To end the night, the receipt is given to you in a shoe.. You should have seen the upset on the waitresses face upon putting the baby shoe on our table. We chatted about it and the waitress agreed with us that a baby shoe, any shoe, does not belong on a table!!   So, 3 stars because I don't think they have fine tuned everything because they are new.. And that's completely understandable. I'm excited to be back because I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood. Hopefully the little kinks are smoothed out for my next time."}
{"text":"We had our company Christmas Party at Whist and Chris was our waiter.  He was on point throughout the night.  It was a busy night, but he always made sure we were taken care of.  Made the party a success!  Thank you Chris."}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette party here and it was fantastic. The bartender was super friendly and our server was pretty great too. He was very attentive and helpful. I didn't have any food but those who ate seemed to enjoy what they got - it looked delicious. There was a live singer and she was pretty good. Overall a really nice experience."}
{"text":"i loved this place! my friend picked the perfect place to spend her birthday. it's nice and clean, with a beautiful mural in the inside, and the patio is lovely too.  I ordered the chicken n red waffles, and it was delicious! our friends chose the \"Crabby in the Morning\" (crab benedict), lobster bisque, white chocolate and walnut french toast, \"Hangover Burger\", and the salmon salad.  I'm not a big brunch cocktailer but I had the bartender make me a drink similar to their \"Strawberry Blossom\" without the gin, and it was soo good and refreshing.  I was able to taste all the food my friends' ordered and I can say I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went for the food .. it was delicious but went back because of the amazing live musician.. I think he said his name was Jonny Hazard . He took requests and made everything so much more enjoyable .. I definitely will be going back ."}
{"text":"NEGATIVE 5 STARS. The worst service I've ever experienced. My group and I came in at 11am and we were the only ones in the restaurant. After about 45 minutes of waiting at our table, we had to go to the bar to order because our server severely failed to do her job and take our order. We ordered 3 entrees and only 1 came out. Absolutely embarrassing and such a joke. Don't waste your time or your energy going to this place. No wonder they're closing."}
{"text":"Tried the Happy Hour food menu. It's small, but the 2 items I had (Deviled eggs $3 & Italian sandwich (Proper Italian $5) were very good.  Could eat a lot more of those eggs, they're spicy and very tasty. The Italian sandwich was great quality, and it had a nice vinagarette. They also have sliders on the Happy Hour menu, will get those next time! The 2 items I had were pretty filling, and what a good price for excellent happy hour food!  They take their cocktails seriously here. I watched an employee preparing drink garnishes, and he was taking no short cuts. The first cocktail I had here was Ruby Slippers, a wicked, delicious grapefruity concoction. Also of note, they have a lot of bottled beers that are 22 oz or so. Samuel Smith is one, they have strawberry & apricot. Most of their beer selection is a little high brow, which is awesome in my opinion.  Employees are very friendly, they are happy to give food or drink recommendations.  And, smoking is prohibited. Better words were never spoken!"}
{"text":"Breakfast yesterday morning. Wow the crab hash browns are a must try. Service was great! I had the pancakes I didn't recall seeing blueberry pancakes on the menu but they came with blueberries. The decor is pretty cool very vintage. It was an overall nice experience with good eats.  We will return."}
{"text":"We live in the District @ Green Valley, so I WISH I loved Whist.  We've tried it twice.  First time for dinner and food was mediocre and overpriced.  Second time, no one ever waited on us.  Twenty minutes - never waited on us!  They were busy, and it was a Sunday morning (brunch service).  After 15 minutes someone brought us water, and said they would be right back.  Never returned, so we left.  The hostess never even questioned us getting up and walking out.  No more chances from me - too bad, since it is so convenient.  There are lots of other choices nearby."}
{"text":"We tried it out for Saturday brunch. Place was steady but not busy. Service was EXTREMELY slow. Got sat and didn't see a server for about 15 minutes. Food took another 30 minutes to get to the table. The food was really good and we would go back because of it. French toast was amazing."}
{"text":"A sunday brunch birthday celebration was made exquisite by the efforts of Kaitlyn and Juan. Both went above and beyond to accommodate every indulgence!  All of which was experienced in the district's patio atmosphere.  Love the vibes, bottomless mimosas!"}
