{"text":"I am the first to admit that I don't know Roncesvalles Village well. A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.

One such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.
My friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.

We submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a \"Christmas burger\" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. 

Also sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. 

If you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. 
No matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!

By the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's been amazing every time! Chill vibe, great food, yummy drinks and awesome friendly service!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to try a new local brunch place. The Ace is super cute, small, quaint, and had a rockin playlist playing. The menu seems exciting, but both my husband and i were underwhelmed by our meals. He go the breakfast burrito and I got the huevos rancheros. 

Maybe I shouldn't expect good \"Mexican Breakfast\" at a tiny brunch place, but I always try. I LOVE Mexican breakfasts!!! 

The meals were \"fine\" both needed salt and something to make them interesting or different from what i might attempt at home. They need to add an interesting salsa, a special sour cream, some spices, or SOMETHING to give it taste. I asked for hot sauce and was given what looked like Sriracha- again, nothing interesting or in-house made. Underwhelming. 

I might go back to check out the sweet meals- they looked great on the plate. 

The servers were friendly, but there defiantly needed to be another server. It was difficult to get eye contact with a server to get more coffee, hot sauce, or the check."}
{"text":"Average food.

Over priced for the quantity and quality. We got the burger and fried chicken. 17-18$ for run of the mill fried chicken or a burger not including drinks. I hope they lower their prices based on their quality of food since you can get superior food and atmosphere in similar priced restaurant on the street such the blue plate.

Atmosphere is that of a diner. While some might think they are aiming to recreate the 50s diner look, I have a feeling the owners just wanted to save money. The place is cramped with few tables. At the moment its hard to find seating in the evening. Saw 3 couples turned down given the long waiting time and no place to sit on the counter to wait.

I actually saw them place a take out order on a plate wrapped in tin foil. They asked the customer  to return the plates later. 

The girl behind the counter -maggie?- can be a bit 'curt' at times. Service is friendly, otherwise.

Might check it out later if they lower their prices and are a bit more organized."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who didn't particularly enjoy my experience here? We brought some family members here from out of town since it was highly recommended from a tv show (you've gotta eat here? Or maybe diners, drive ins and dives?)

The place was packed and the four of us got crammed into a little booth. The waitress was busy chatting with another employee and took forever to come over to take our order. The food was decent, nothing to write home about. The thing that really surprised me was that they used generic store brand buns for their burgers (I think it was Good Value brand - we saw the chef take it out from the back.)

I ordered a coffee and when the waitress came by asking me if I would like a refill, she failed to mention that it wasn't free. The service was mediocre at best and the thing that annoyed me the most was that their credit card machine defaulted at 20%. If you're expecting a 20% tip, you should provide service that warrants a 20% tip! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cozy, delicious, creative comfort food with great service. Had dinner here with some girlfriends after our first choice up the street was full - but in hindsight we should have come straight here. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I researched tons of restaurants before my family came to town and settled on The Ace. I'd been there once before, but just for drinks and oysters. I'm so sorry I went back. The food including the pate, arctic char, and steak frites were awful - bad taste and/or over cooked. The pate honestly tasted like vomit. We had to send it back. A family member ordered the country fried steak and it was dry and one of the most unappetizing looking and tasting dishes of the night. The server could care less. For somewhere that's supposed to be 'kid friendly,' they would not substitute any sides (can't replace fries with veggies sorry!) and had no kids cup. I'm sorry The Ace, but you have got to do better than this. I'm embarrassed that I took my family here. Thankfully we had an awesome meal at Momofuku for lunch. Ugh."}
{"text":"Kimchi fried rice, pork belly, and two fried eggs, all in a breakfast bowl? Well done Ace, well done. 

This place is a little gem of good food, eat here."}
{"text":"Just the eggs Benny here is worth the trip. Honeslty the best eggs benny in the city. Service is also really good and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here a week ago with high expectations as we'd previously gone to the Ace for brunch and were very satisfied with our meals.

I decided to try the AAA brisket burger and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and cornbread. Before we got our mains we started with the deep fried Ontario Brussel sprouts-these paired with the lemon aioli were delicious and you're given sizeable portion that's easily enough for a couple to share. Unfortunately this was the lone bright spot of our meal. 

My brisket burger, while cooked to medium as I requested was over salted by whoever was working the grill that night. When I bit into it all I could taste was salt, which overpowered the meat and condiments (which were very limited and barely noticeable). If we weren't sitting next to the kitchen I would've sent it back. Correction - I should've sent it back. 

My girlfriends fried chicken also missed the mark. It was tough and chewy and not all that flavourful. You would think the chef would nail something simple like fried chicken but you could tell it had been under-seasoned and likely not been brined or left in buttermilk overnight to be moistened. The cornbread and collard greens were decent but I think this dish would've been better paired with a mashed potato. 

Overall thoughts: 

We definitely left dinner unimpressed but maybe we came into it with our expectations set too high after doing brunch a few months earlier. 

We'll likely return for brunch at the Ace but with other options available on Ronce, Queen St W and the Junction at a similar price point I don't think we'll be back for dinner. In my mind the Ace failed to separate itself from its dinner competition with some very underwhelming comfort food."}
{"text":"As a longtime local I've seen the strip load up with places to avoid. The Ace is not one of them. The few times I've gone I've found the food to be very good. I don't go often coz it's pricey, but it's worth it occasionally. Atmosphere, service and decor are all good."}
{"text":"I try the eggs benedict everywhere in the city, and these were pretty high up there! It was a leek and parm hollandaise sauce (it was good, but I think I prefer the classic). The service was great, there when we wanted, but not hovering. We had a lovely seat at the front, but it was a bit crowded. Shows it's a popular place though!

I would definitely return when I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"4 years after leaving my beloved neighhourhood, Roncesvalles is now the Toronto's new hot restaurant row. In the last year (since the streetcar track project finished up) we've seen tons of places open: Barque, Hopgood's Foodliner, The Waverly and The Ace. I use to walk by the old storefront that The Ace now occupies and think that it would make an amazing bar. I guess others felt the same!

Went for brunch on a Sunday morning. Arrived around 12:30pm, put our name down for a table. There were two parties before us. Silly thing: they will take your name, but not your telephone number. They will not call you. Strike one. We walked Roncesvalles for a bit because they told us it would be about 25 minutes. Upon returning and checking in, I was notified that there was 3 tables in front of us, though on the list there was only two still (it was right in front of me). The hostess said that they had a table of six before us. Weird. I guess its not really first come, first serve. We waited for another 15 minutes, watched two tables turn over, which they preceded to \"hold\" for the parties before us. Maybe if they took phone numbers they could have called to tell the other parties that their table was ready. 10 minutes after that, they finally \"gave us\" one of the table, putting us in the back corner near the kitchen door. The other tables in front of us didn't show or come even after we were seated. Terrible customer service. 

Food: Meh. Typical brunch food. Our table ordered: Huevos Rancheros ($10), Ace Benedict ($13) & a scrambled eggs special ($10). All three were good, nothing to rave home about. Heuvos is better down the street at Easy Restaurant. Their benedict can be ordered pretty much in any restaurant that does brunch in the city. 
While eating, their chef carried large dirty rubber mats past our table (about a foot from where we were sitting), three times. My guess to take them out back to clean them. Wonder if this could have been done when you don't have people eating in such close proximity.

Would I go back: nope. Not worth the trip across the city. If little trendy places like this want to stay in business, they need to get their service sorted out."}
{"text":"Nice Atmosphere, Lovely Staff, Decent Food.

I want to give The Ace a higher rating because they are so nice and the atmosphere is so great.  It's a great brunch spot, but the dinner food is just okay.  Nothing bad but nothing mind blowing either.  Good, cozy neighbourhood eatery."}
{"text":"We saw this place on TV and gave it a try. The vibe is great, but it did not meet expectations.

In terms of the food, we found the portions too small. I had the breakfast burrito. It was not satisfying despite a good taste.... and the side of potatoes was tiny.

The other thing was that we had to wait for food long although it was not busy.

A minor thing at the end was that the default tip setting on the debit machine was set to 20 percent..... left a snotty taste as we left as this was definitely not justifiable ... Gave the usual 15."}
{"text":"Very nice little spot, has that old diner charm to it. Workers are super friendly and food was great.

Came in for brunch -  had egg/cheese sandwich and some french toast. Very good. Real maple syrup was given, big plus! Their home fries are awesome, very unique. 

If you have a group, keep in mind more that 4 people will be tough -  their is one section here that could accommodate more, maybe 6 people or 8, but that's it."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had their turkey burger and it was fantastic but I have to say they have the very best escargot I've ever had in my life! The service is awesome and the atmosphere is hip yet classy."}
{"text":"Go to there.
Order everything.
Eat everything.
Drink their espresso.
Eat their chocolate pierogies.
Tip well.
Go home.
Night well spent."}
{"text":"The food was very good, we were there for brunch on Easter weekend, the French toast with caramelized bananas was really tasty but the prices are a bit high so prepare to pay much more then your average dinner."}
{"text":"The brunch here is perfectly fine, but The Ace really shines after dark. A soundtrack of Motown favourites, the classic-without-being-pretentious diner furnishings, great cocktails, and consistently excellent food. The pork chop with the gratin of rutabaga is one of my favourite dishes on any menu in the city. The service is friendly and down-home, a very nice change from the typical pretentiousness of way too many establishments in this town. 

Another plus is the kitchen is open late. Rolling in late after a movie, show or flight and ordering up a couple of great cocktails with some late night snack to accompany is one of my favourite things to do."}
{"text":"Just saw The Ace being featured on DDD again. It peaked my interest, but after reading some of the reviews here I don't think I'll even attempt to experience this restaurant.  It seems extremely overpriced while using the cheapest ingredients. Who knows what Guy was thinking when DDD chose to feature this place."}
{"text":"In a town where there seems to be a diner around every corner, The Ace trumps them all. 

A stunning 30's deco interior, similar to that of The Lakeview, greets the diner, all curved wood and crome. 

We went for the lunch today. I had the sandwich special ; pork belly and slaw baguette . It was crispy, tender and not too greasy, I washed it down with a so-so Wellington Dark Ale.

I've been for brunch and next time will return for that."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Food was decent, but took an hour. It wasn't packed either, a coupe of tables had their orders in front of us. Our waitress was good, but the kitchen was real slow."}
{"text":"Pretty shocked at some of the negative reviews here. We live in the neighbourhood and eat here almost once a week, though always for dinner not for brunch. The menu changes up periodically and some versions have more attractive options than others but we always find something we like and the servers are consistently very attentive and really friendly toward us and our kid. They consistently come up with dishes I'd likely not try elsewhere but end up loving and their fries are top notch. They make great cocktails too. So all the people trying to paint The Ace with the shitty hipster brush can go bitch elsewhere and leave this neighbourhood gem for us, thanks."}
{"text":"I had a opportunity to sample the Wild Boar Burger on the dinner menu last night. They certainly managed to tame all the wildness out of the dish leaving a small dark, near naked burger on the smallest,whitest bun ( think Wonder Bread) I've seen. It was accompanied by the prerequisite over salted fries. Why \"fine\" restaurants insist on following McDonald's lead, I'll never understand."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interior design. My first time here I found it on yelp. The breakfast burrito and BLT and coffee were delicious. I can't wait to come back to try the other menu items. They have brunch, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We checked out the Ace for brunch this weekend.  When we arrived, there were a few couples/groups ahead of us, waiting for tables.  The problem is, there's nowhere to wait.  With the frigid temperatures we've been having, we were all trying to huddle by the door.  A few couples took a seat at the counter while they waited for a booth, but this also caused quite a bit of confusion, as couples were then being seated out of order (they lost track of who was next, and who was sitting at the counter).  There's one larger table in the front window, and every time the server needed to get to their table, everyone in the doorway had to shift and shuffle around to let her by.  

Anyway, we were able to get a table fairly quickly - I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes.  We ordered a cappucino and latte right away, and when our server came back with water, we asked her if we could order - we hadn't received our drinks yet, but we already knew what we wanted, having stared at the menu while we waited for a table. 

As is customary for my hubby and I, he had the Eggs Benny, and I had the French Toast.  It showed up oddly fast!   That is not a complaint, but it was a bit bizarre how quickly our food arrived.  In fact, we were still waiting for our coffee drinks.  The French Toast with carmelized bananas and blueberries was enjoyable.  I liked it more than I thought I would.  The latte was satisfying.  My husband enjoyed his Eggs Benny, but decided that he preferred the Eggs Benny at Barque's Smokehouse up the street better.  But he did enjoy this one.  He also commented that he homefries were good - he particularly liked how crispy they were, but also noted that nothing compares to our favourite homefries at Mitzi's Sister, where the mystery seasoning is magical.  The homefries at The Ace were more plain, but still very well enjoyed.

The atmosphere is interesting - I like the kitschy, vintage feel of the old diner/Chinese restaurant.  But it also feels a bit stale.  In fact, I can't say for sure, but the wallpaper seems to be leftover from the restaurant's previous lives, and I couldn't help but wonder how many years of deep fryer grease and cigarette smoke were buried in it.  

I enjoyed the experience, but it felt a bit claustrophobic and stuffy for breakfast.  I'd be intrigued to see what it feels like with a late-night dinner vibe.

One last note - we paid via credit card, and when our server brought us the credit card terminal to our table, I was quite surprised to see that the default tip % was set to 20%.  Luckily it had the option of \"other\".  While I may sometimes consider paying a 20% tip, I didn't feel that our breakfast experienced warranted that much.  It seemed awfully presumptious.  It's a bit of a put-off.  While I always do tip, I'm of the school of thought that a tip should be earned, not expected.

We'll return, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"Wow. What a quirky amazing place. The food was fantastic starting with coffee that didn't disappoint. Not usually a French Toast guy but the Challah bread made a wonderful base for the bananas and blueberries. The BLT was light and fresh. Would definitely go back to try something else off the menu. The service was also prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Has vegan options! Mushroom saute is awesome :) home fries are just deep fried.. hot sauce is spiceyish tofu scramble was pretty good. Cesar was better than avg. Arugula salad was bland."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE this place!!! It's fantastic!!!
Firstly, the service is great. Everyone is so friendly. My coffee never runs low and they are super quick with the orders.
I've been here twice now and loved it both times. I especially like it because there are very few breakfast places that have lots of veggie options. The Ace has lots! And for some odd reason, I don't like the taste of eggs so they allow me to sub tofu in just about everything. 
I had the breakfast burrito both times. Loved it. The salsa was fresh and tangy. The burrito was rolled nice and tight so everything wasn't falling our all over the place. It also comes with home fries which can be so hit and miss depending on the place. But no surprise here, The Ace gets it right. The home fries are crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. 
I literally tell everyone who talks about brunch spots to go to The Ace.
Can't wait to go back :D"}
{"text":"The food was good. I like the vintage plates. I had a dirty water glass. Was charged $5 for OJ but the menu said $4.50. Staff was friendly and was good about getting coffee refills. Had the Ace breakfast and huevos rancheros with a side of chorizo."}
{"text":"I went to the Ace tonight for a late-night dinner. It was my second visit to the restaurant and the first time I went (right after they opened) I had a disappointing meal so tonight I was giving them a second, more seasoned, chance. The service was great. The atmosphere was wonderful and intimate. It's a great place to hang out and have some drinks and snacks- maybe? I am sad to report that their dinner meals taste like mediocre pub grub at higher-end prices. I did not expect to pay $100 for a 2 person meal that didn't taste as good as one would at The Lakeview, which would have cost a quarter of the price. The Ace just doesn't do cuisine in any way. Will I come again to have drinks? Absolutely. It really is a fun little joint, just not for dinner."}
{"text":"For brunch. Great food. Friendly service.  Quick and relaxing.  Order the Bennie it's awesome."}
{"text":"I love The Ace. I just moved nearby and this was the first restaurant I wanted to try on the Roncy strip. The food was delicious and the service was very friendly but I found the final bill to be too much for my price range. The atmosphere is great though and I often gaze in jealously at their customers, as I walk by.
A word of warning: Our party came on a Sunday evening when they have their kids-eat-free special. The restaurant opens at 5 and when we arrived at about 450, there was already a long line. We ended up waiting for quite a while inside the restaurant too. The restaurant was packed with kids and their families so it was pretty loud. We even had a little girl climb right over and onto our booth but she was pretty cute and no one minded much. If you don't like children, you may want to avoid the place on Sunday nights. Although if you didn't like children... what are you doing in Roncesvalles?!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find an interesting new resto on Roncy but I tried it twice and the chef is big into lots of salt.  I mentioned this to them on the first visit  but had the same issue the second time.  You can add salt but you cannot take it out so for that reason I won't go back.  It's not fun walking out with puffed up feet - my friends felt the same way."}
{"text":"This was our first time there (this past Sat., May 26/12). Not sure why I haven't heard of or been to this place before. What a fabulous find!
A classic vintage neighbourhood diner feel, but the food is definitely 'not your average diner'! Even one of the servers was dressed in vintage 50's attire & hairdo!
The menu is big on eggs, which was fin for what we were seeking.
I had Huevos Rancheros and my wife had the Cheese Biscuits with scrambles Eggs & Ham Gravy (that's right! HAM GRAVY!)
My Huevos was very good, and unique, esp in that the eggs are fired over easy, as opposed to scrambled. The portion size was just right.
My wife's dish was awesome, especially with the gravy. The biscuits tasted home baked, and were delicious. Its a bigger, heavier dish, suitable for larger appetites!
One of the nicest surprises was how good the COFFEE was! Most diners coffee is average at best, and usually sends me seeking my fave brew at Coffee Tree (or the like). But the brew at Ace is excellent & full-bodied. Bottomless cup is $2.
So, The ace makes their OWN Ice Cream & Sorbet on site!
We were too full to sample some, but will definitely make room next time.
How many 'diners' make their own Ice Cream? Let alone home baked biscuits & homemade gravy?
We will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on a tv show, and I was really intrigued when I saw the chef preparing the Christmas burger and Mac N' Cheese burger. 
I finally got the chance to check this place out. The place is small, but cozy, and the waitress was perfect (efficient, great attitude, friendly without being overly chatty, and just plain cute!) Sadly, the burgers did not meet my expectations. The burgers were quite small, the buns were dry, and the Mac N' Cheese part of the burger was not very cheesy. We also had the lamb burger which was just ok...I've had better."}
{"text":"Generally we stray away from diners, but decided to take a chance on The Ace based on the great reviews and delicious looking food pictures. Plus, we were hoping to take a stroll through High Park to catch the short-lived Sakura blossom season, and this was a good bet as any other for Sunday brunch in the area.

First impressions...
----
 It is a long, fairly small sized restaurant with no more seating than for 20 or so people. Retro. Bar takes up a good chunk of the restaurant space. Plenty of attentive staff, and the wait time before greeting was barely nil. The crowd is mixed, including young families with kids, thirty and twenty something couples. 


Food...
----
Brunch options ranged from classic eggs benny dishes to more creative brunch specials. I was feeling adventurous, and decided to go for the special.

Curried Duck Confit Hash- Spinach, Onions, Diced Potatoes, Topped with Egg and Toast. I am picky when it comes to duck. However, this confit was not too heavy for breakfast. The duck was mixed in with golden brown hash and spinach. The portion was good. Overall, OK. Would not order again though.

My boyfriend tried the Huevo Rancheros: Two Farm-Fresh Eggs served Over Easy with Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, & Salsa Fresca, on a Fresh Corn Tortilla. Pretty typical fare, but what stood out was the guacamole. Definitely tasted fresh and homemade, with a strong citrusy kick. The tortilla was a bit tough.

Both items were very fairly priced at $13. The coffee, however was way overpriced.


Service...
----
We were very well attended. Wait time was between 15-25 minutes with fast turnover. Very friendly and accommodating staff. 


Walking away thinking...
----
About the benny. Also the challah french toast topped with carmalized bananas and blueberries one table over. It was piled high and dripping sugar. Mmm."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best in Roncesvalles. Food is amazing. Service is excellent. Do not believe the negative reviews. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped by the ace on a whim, first to grab a pint and thought we would get some food at the same time. Unfortunately for us, as vegetarians, there were very few options for us. No big deal, we just opted for appetizers and beer.

I must say that the beer selection is very good, and the appetizers we had were amazing! (specifically the fried and breaded artichoke bits, or whatever they were calling them). Loved the atmosphere, too.

Apart from the lack of Veg options, my only complaint is that it's a bit pricey. But heck, it was very good too, so you get what you pay for. Can't vouch for the entrees, sadly (but they were $$$), so I'm sure they were great too."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for a Mother's Day brunch. They loved the decor/atmosphere and were even more impressed with the food. We all had our eyes set on some dessert after our meals but couldn't get any as we were all too full. Would definitely love to come back and try the full menu one night.  
Tip - they know how to make one hell of a cocktail."}
{"text":"I just love The Ace, I've been eating here for years and I've never left unhappy. A cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, great music, and fair prices in an otherwise expensive neighbourhood of restaurants. 

I suggest starting with Moules Frites, the recipe changes frequently but they do it beautifully. The country fried chicken is a winner, I ask for extra ham gravy, the steak frites is also fantastic and perfectly cooked to order every time. 

Great vibes all around!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe here, we have been coming back for years! Brunch is the best at The Ace, I usually get the 3 cheese grilled sandwich and my boyfriend gets the eggs benny. I agree the portion sizes are small and the prices have increased but the food always tastes great!
Later at night it's a romantic hole in the wall with a dim diner atmosphere -  amazing for a shot or two... or three of tequila, and a walk down Roncy!"}
{"text":"The time has come the Walrus said to talk of many things:

Like really good burgers, amazing fried chicken, great daily pastas and sandwiches.  All in an authentically restored diner that I use to eat at when I was a tiny wee little girl with my Dad.  Unlike most new restaurants this place has an interesting backstory.  I use to come here to eat with my Dad when I could barely get up on the barstools.  Then one day the doors were closed and the curtains drawn with only dead plants in the window.  And as I grew up and walked past this place through grade school, then high school, then on my way to work, it stayed closed, curtained, dark and sad.  Then late 2011 a miracle.  A new restaurant diner was born.  Lovingly restored with original booths, counters, bar stools, and even the original wallpaper.  The food here is really great, and my favorites are their Portobello Burger (yummy), Country fried chicken (finger licking), Xmas Burger (delish) and their chocolate pierogies (OMG).  My only advice for those of you, who like me are on the Poofy side, the booths are pretty squishy, so if you can, grab the front window tables which have much more room."}
{"text":"When I'm kicking it in Roncesvalles with my favorite kids, I usually hit up Easy for some brunch. But, since we were all feeling a little bit adventurous (not really) last weekend, we decided to check out The Ace for some brunch eats. I have to say that this little diversion from our usual Roncy jam was, in fact, an ace choice. We managed to finagle a window seat, which j'adore for creepy people waching, and poured over the menu. Everything looked delish, but I went with my usual order of eggs benny, and it was a fine choice indeed! As per usual. Our server was an absolute gem and as sweet as pie. Overall, a very welcome and pleasing venture into a retro-inspired \"diner\" with good friends that of course equals good times. I will return one day for another brunch challenge. You have my word."}
{"text":"I hate it when you order a coffee and the waitress comes by to ask you if you'd like a refill- naturally you say yes, because the cups are usually kind of small and one cup is never quite enough- only to find out when the bill arrives that for each refill or top up of your crappy diner coffee you've actually been charged an additional 2.50$! 

I could understand if I was getting an espresso based drink, but plain drip coffee? Please... 

If you're going to charge people at least let them know. My boyfriend and were charged 10$ for coffee between the two of us. That was more than my breakfast!"}
{"text":"Excellent. It is nice to see a new restaurant take over from where the previous tenant left off. This place is a 50's   Diner through and through.  The food is better, of course.  Even the music was straight out of the 50's.  Loved it all. Had a few drinks and they have a nice selection of foods. All fresh. For 2 people we had two appetizers, split a main and two desserts.  The desserts were amazing.  Zucchini cake with oatmeal ice cream and chocolate perogies. It is a great, comfortable place to go."}
{"text":"Great place, very small I would guess the wait time on Friday or Saturday night would loooong! We had several apps and all were top shelf so I am betting the entrees are all very good as well. Make sure you try the buffalo fries yum!"}
{"text":"Went to the ACE the other day after trekking through the cherry blossom beauty in High Park for a good two hours, therefore my friend and I were starved. 
We shared deep-friend asparagus, which was GREAT. Came with an incredible sauce, although there were FIVE asparagus poppers, I think it should be four or six, five is not shareable and half of the tables in the restaurant are seats for couples. 
The reason my rating is only getting a 3 yet starting out so wonderfully, is the pricing. It is quite an expensive little bar-diner. Drinks are no less than $9, and some of the drinks have 2/3 fruit or garnish in the glass so you're honestly getting about 3 gulps and then you're done. Better off getting beer here, the cocktails aren't that great anyway. 
I had the Vegetarian Portobello Mushroom burger and my friend had the Lamb Burger, opposite sides of the spectrum. 
SO, there was about a semi-squirt of sauce on my friend's burger, which was really a selling point in her even ordering it, so she was mega disappointed. Seriously, there was NO SAUCE. It was a lamb burger with tziziki sauce and other stuff but all I could see was her struggling with a GIGANTIC piece of meat between a bun. The size of meat was honestly the size of my fist, and I have HUGE hands. Her only remarks were \"more sauce, less meat.\" For the record, that honking piece of lamb was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious, just WAY too much for the little bun. 
My burger was fantastic, it was a ginormous portobello mushroom stuffed with alfalfa and goat cheese and red peppers, and it was delicious. I have no comments, except, don't eat it on a date, it's messy as all hell. 
So, if you're rollin' in cash, go splurge, it's delicious and quaint. If you're a student wanting cheap but good food and drinks, go elsewhere. 
Happy Eating"}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of good restaurants, but I've always felt it lacking in places that I feel compelled to recommend to someone visiting from out of town. To put it another way, on my top 10 best restaurant meals ever, Toronto doesn't make an appearance for more than 2. The Ace gets the nod for one, and I regularly frequent it because it has never varied much from that great experience. For those who haven't been, here are the reasons:

1. The ambiance of the place is perfect. Cool, unpretentious, cozy, with good music, equally appropriate for a date or to take your grandparents out for a once a year dinner. It's like the 50-year-old standbys in New York and Paris where you see movie stars eating along side old couples. 

2. The food is exceptionally good. The steak is the best I've had in Toronto. The fried chicken is the best I've had ever. With fresh oysters, lots of salad options and the best homemade ice cream I've had, it really is a menu to satisfy food lovers but the staples on the menu equally placate those picky-eaters one must frequently entertain. 

3. The price is a steal. $22 for steak frites? $17 for fried chicken dinner? You can barely eat fast food for that much nowadays. Even if I could cook half as well, I couldn't cook these dishes for less at home. At any of the other \"top class\" restaurants in TO, these dishes would cost double and still wouldn't be as good.

4. The cocktails are as good as any place in Toronto. Real attention to detail, fresh ingredients. Classic or personalized. 

5. The service is friendly and attentive. Not precious, not pushy. Just right. Like you're at a friend's dinner party.

The difference about the Ace really comes down to one thing. It doesn't need an angle. It's a real place where the owners have obviously decided to forgo image and just hit all the marks of what a restaurant should be. Amen I say."}
{"text":"I might be a bit biased about this place because I live around the corner, but I love this place. I see that some of the reviews complain about the furniture, but I actually find this place endearing and charmingly vintage. I also tend to go for dinner, where's a cozy candle-light ambience - so maybe dim lighting goes along way to help the furniture? I've been there a few times for brunch and proper lunch and all my meals were great. My favourite lunch dish is whenever they serve their fried chicken sandwich. It's pretty life changing. Dinner menu changes pretty frequently but I really like the asparagus/cheese/egg situation that is featured periodically. It's worth checking out the featured cocktails, they tend to be pretty tasty. I had some sort of bourbon concoction that was fantastic, especially given that I'm not a big bourbon fan. Anyhow, it's worth checking out. Quick tip, there's only one group table (seats 5-6 people), and this is typically the only table they take reso's for so call ahead if you want it."}
{"text":"Ventured to the west end for a Saturday Brunch here at The Ace. 

There was a moderate amount of seating, several booths and a few two seater tables, making the restaurant date and toddler friendly. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a group larger than 4. Arrived shortly before noon with a friend, there was a short 10 minute wait before getting seated. 

We are big eaters so naturally, three mains were ordered. 

1. Sauteed Italian Sausage, White Beans, & Rapini, topped with a Fried Egg & served with Brown Toast - $12 - (7/10) - The sausage was crumbled with the white beans and topped with a runny egg. I didn't have the toast, but it looked like a hearty whole grain toast I would eat if I wasn't avoiding gluten. We would have enjoyed this dish more if there were larger, more wholesome chunks of sausage. 

2. Huevos Rancheros - Two Farm-Fresh Eggs served Over Easy with Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, & Salsa Fresca, on a Fresh Corn Tortilla - $11 - (8/10) - This was a gluten free option as the tortilla wraps were made of corn. The over easy eggs were farmer fresh. I usually don't like runny eggs, but the runny yolk perfectly fused the flavours of the guac, beans and tortilla together. 


3. Nicoise Salad - Italian Tuna with Green Beans, Arugula, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Hard-Boiled Eggs, Olives, & Lemon - $12 - (5/10) - Gluten free & dairy free - Always love my greens but this salad wasn't too inspiring. The arugula was fresh and the two green beans included were cooked to crisp. Downsides: small portion size and sparse sprinkle of toppings. The portion size is comparable to a side salad. 

4. Fresh squeezed Orange Juice & Grapefruit Juice - $4.50 a glass - (9/10) - Can't really do wrong with fresh squeezed juice. My personal preference is to include some pulp and to serve this in a more generous glass. 

Rating Summary: 

Food: 7/10 - average for the dishes noted above, portion sizes could be larger for the price

Atmosphere: 9/10 - enjoyable diner vibe

Service: 8/10 - water service was lacking and servers could be friendlier"}
{"text":"By all means you have to try this place, you will NOT be disappointed!

I've been three times now and it's been fantastic every time.  It has a great vibe, casual atmosphere, reasonably priced and the servers very knowledgeable and helpful.  The menus are simple (both drink and food), presented on tiny wooden clipboards.   They have a brunch on Sundays which I've heard is great and is something I'll go back for on my fourth visit!

Now the good stuff, the food simply rocks.  Portion sizes, quality of ingredients and even the presentation is very well done.  Did I mention all this for very reasonable prices?  

Here's what I've had:

Kale salad with goat cheese, beets and crispy chick peas.  So far one of the best Kale salads I've had.  The crispy chick peas are crunchy and give it a great texture.

Tenderloin beef tartare with homemade chips.  OK tartare may not be for everyone, but SO tasty.  The chips?  I could have easily had a second helping of those!

Flat iron steak frites.  Hard to mess up a classic and believe me they don't!  Just the right amount of steak with a very flavorful, rich sauce (just a little).

Grilled pork loin chop, sage gratin, roasted apple compote.  Need I say more?  Delicious...

This is an easy five star for me.  Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love it. I came here for Brunch so I can only speak for that.. and that was great.

The Ace is a retro diner that has been well re-created. I loved being a part of the scene there, the place had great style and super friendly service.

The food is awesome! I had the French Toast and my bf had the Eggs Benny. They were both so good I ate my french toast and half my bf eggs benny. My poor bf couldn't even read the paper without me stealing bites of his dish. I can't wait to go back and try the green eggs and ham sandwich!! Or eat what I had all over again, it was that good."}
{"text":"After a disastrous day of let down after let down, we randomly ended up here for dinner.  Thank goodness we were able to end off our day on a high note.

This tiny little bar/restaurant makes you feel like you've gone back in time.  Cute little tables, vintage chairs, the wallpaper,...  

The service was friendly and entertaining.  Can you name a restaurant at which the staff randomly picks up a guitar and then starts singing?  They're good singers too!

I started with a tequila cocktail made with egg white and Cassis.  It was delicious!  

Five of us sat at a table and we each ordered different dishes so we could try a bit of everything. 

We ordered:

Duck gravy poutine.  This was very tasty and wasn't meant to be shared amongst five people.  We devoured it.  

I insisted on the fried Brussels sprouts cuz we all need to eat our veggies.  Really good.  The bottom of the dish was kinda greasy but hey, these things were fried so it was expected.  

The turkey burger with all the trimmings was alright but it wasn't my favourite dish.  It came with fries.  Glad we saved the gravy so we could dip our fries.  The dill aioli was pretty good too.  

The fried chicken I felt was a tad dry, but that's also because I had the white meat.  The cornbread was a bit too crumbly and dry for my liking.  

The fish soup of the day consisted of mussels, potatoes, and sausages.  The mussels were good but the broth was maybe a little light on salt.  

I really enjoyed the steak tartare.  I think I could've eaten a double portion of that alone.  

My favourite of the evening were the scallops (special of the day) on du Puy lentils with housemade sausage.  Now truthfully, there was something in the seasoning of the sausage that just didn't make it a wow for me, but the scallops were perfectly seared and cooked.  I loved them.  

I think this place was on that show, \"You Gotta Eat Here\" for breakfast/brunch?  Roncy is kinda off my beaten path but I can see the draw of this place as a local bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Tweets about the specials have been luring me for weeks, but my husband was hard to convince because he thought it looked like a grubby little pub. Luckily I knew better (because I read yelp.ca!). The experience was a pleasure from start to finish. Although promoting itself largely as a purveyor of comfort foods, the Ace has an adventurous and accomplished kitchen. Portion sizes are just right - completely satisfying and not under- or over- indulgent. We cleaned our plates and enjoyed extras like homemade barbeque sauce and garlic aioli with dill with our fries. If you still have room, do not pass up the chance to check out the homemade ice creams. The oatmeal ice cream was like being wrapped in a cozy blanket reading your favourite book while eating the best melt in your mouth oatmeal cookie ever. I wish I had been brave enough to try the bourbon bacon and apple variety - next time!

It's a bit noisy in there so you won't be able to whisper to each other, but conversation is possible and lively around you. The table beside us had a six week old baby with them and they seemed a comfortable fit with the couples at the other tables and the hipsters eating at the bar. Staff are friendly, welcoming, informed and enthusiastic about the menu. This place gets bonus points for the asian-inspired wallpaper that pays homage to the Chinese restaurant that was an earlier inhabitant of the space. I will definitely come back and I will bring friends (of all ages!)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and incredible food. Service was really friendly and efficient. Love the cocktail selection; amazing twists on some classics. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the Ace! The vibe was very cool... The food was top notch (a foodies dream!)... And the service was perfection. Can't say enough about this local treasure on Ronci!"}
{"text":"After an hour qnd fifteen minutes of wait it turnsout our order was not even placed! Its a mess in the place and they are not organized"}
{"text":"We had high expectations, having only dined at Defina in Roncy. This experience was definitely incomparable to that. This was more in the meh category, even though we were super hungry. It was also expensive. Not my fave combination."}
{"text":"Right in the neighbourhood, I needed to finally visit. The menu is brief and focused. The place and staff are unpretentious but really care. The fried brussels sprouts are great, as was the ceviche. We tried two different burgers and both were tasty and just the right size. I liked the fries (fry truck style); my wife prefers a crunchy frite style.

Service was excellent and they really care about what we thought about the food, wine, cocktails. Great night out. I will surely return to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"2 stars for the poached eggs, 1 star for the name (our son's name is Ace as well!).

The restaurant really needs to be renovated.
The furniture is super run down and falling apart (my chair had a hole in the seat and they had applied tape to cover that instead of replacing the chair). 

We ordered the Ace Breakfast, Ace Benedict and coffee.
The coffee was bitter and tasted burned, the home fries were overcooked and super dry, the portion sizes were rather small considering the price.
Only the poached eggs of the Ace Benedict were really enjoyable.

This visit was a one-time experience for us."}
{"text":"I have eaten so much french toast in my life and this is definitely one of my favourites (I loved the one I had for brunch at Laduree in Paris, but that one also had to include the ambiance that comes with eating the the famous teahouse).  A challah french toast with caramelized bananas and fresh blueberries makes for the perfect combo here.  The bread was INCREDIBLY moist, eggy and SO soft!  Thinking about it makes my mouth water a little.  While the bananas were a bit hard (I think they were not ripe yet), it doesn't take away from the fact that you have to try this place for yourself. *Note - before going to Paris the best french toast in Toronto was from Le Petit Dejeuner.  I need to make a trip back there sometime to see if it's still as good as I remember."}
{"text":"Brunch brunch brunch! Their menu has the usual brunch items. However, the real gem are the daily recommendations that your server will tell you about that are not on the menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a sunny side duck egg on top. The chicken was evenly battered and not overly greasy. The waffle was crispy and egg runny. We also got the omelet. However, nothing too special about the omelet. Great service though!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here. The vibe of the place is cool. It has a hipster old diner feel to it. The oriental wall paper is unique and the booths are comfy. One a Thursday evening at 8:30pm, the place was packed. We had to wait about 20 min before a table opened up. The place is small so be prepared to wait if you go during prime hours. The host was friendly making recommendations and suggestions. Our food came out promptly. 

My favourite dish of the meal was the steamed P.E.I mussels. The mussels were nice and juicy and I loved the tomato broth that came with it. One of my favourite parts of the dish was being able to dip the crunchy bread into it. The bacon bits added an extra depth of flavour, and made the dish extra delicious. 

I enjoyed the Black Angus Burger topped with poutine & red wine sauce. The cheese curds were melted nicely and the poutine topping was great. The burger patty was juicy and cooked well. I personally loved the hand cut fries, which were thick kind and not soggy. Add a little malt vinegar made them perfect.

We also ordered the grilled octopus with chorizo bolognese, fried Kale, & potatoes. The octopus was soft, but I didn't like the texture of the octopus. This was my least favourite dish of the night.

For dessert we got the home made pistachio ice-cream. The ice-cream was smooth, and not overly sweet. I liked the bits of pistachio in the ice-cream.

I got the Ace Manhattan. I was looking for something sweeter, and this cocktail didn't do the trick for me. 

I'd come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This is very cool looking retro diner that I expect might usually be better than this review suggests. A lot of thought seems to have gone into the ambience and even the food looked great, so I was surprised to find the food and service were very lackluster. 

I had an open faced halibut sandwich with kale and cauliflower. The fish was terribly overcooked, dry and leathery.  This was a $21 sandwich, by the way.  The fries that came with looked promising but had that texture that you get from a frier that's under temperature. 

For a starter, I ordered the soup. For some reason it arrived at exactly the same time as my main -that being a good 10 minutes later than one might normally expect. Again it looked much better than it tasted. The broth was very weakly flavored.  And it wasn't a case of it being delicately flavored. It was simply too watery. Too bad too, because the pasta was cooked perfectly and it had all the makings of a great soup. 

With my meal I had coffee. Again it didn't live up to the atmosphere. You'd expect that coffee in a diner like this to be good or at least hot. But this coffee was neither. 
So all in all, The Ace was very consistent. Everything looks great, but it was all actually quite disappointing."}
{"text":"My partner and a couple of friends visited The Ace for brunch. I had a great time. The food was great. I had the eggs benedict, my partner had the french toast, and my friends had the breakfast burritos. The food came out quick and the waitress was on point."}
{"text":"After checking out the High Park cherry blossoms one Saturday morning, we went in search of brunch close by.  There were some good options to choose from on Roncesvalles but ultimately we chose the Ace.

We really enjoyed our experience here.  Despite the small lineup, we were seated quickly in a booth.  Lots of items to choose from on the menu - one of us had the Ace Breakfast and the other the weekend omelette.  The breakfast was huge with lots of meat portions and overall good quality.  The omelette was pretty good too, though a little runny.

Service was excellent - our server was so friendly and nice to us.

We enjoyed our meal here and would likely come back.  Although some brunch places can be fairly typical, I would come specifically to the Ace at another time if I was in the area.

Their homemade desserts look awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best places on Roncesvalles. Sure, it's listed as a diner, but what this majestic joint is known best for (or should be known for) are their cocktails - some of the best in Toronto. It's a mixologist's dream at prices ordinary mortals can wrap their heads around. 

The decor totally looks hipster, but trust me, it's not. The staff are amazingly helpful, (and pleasant to boot!), and the classic vibe contributes well to the atmosphere. This is the sort of place you and a friend can sit for hours philosophizing while ordering one round, or a small group can have many drinks and the staff wait on their every word. In short, the staff are pros and they can read you like a book. 

The food is yummy, the cocktails amazing, the staff personable, and the atmosphere sublime. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I loved the brunch - had the eggs Benedict YUM with a $10.50 Caesar, which was just alright....

My companion had the pork belly kimchi egg thing - looked pretty good but a bit greasy.

Our waitress was not very friendly...just ok overall."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and excellent brunch specials. My favourite brunch place by far because they do vegan substitutions. The theme of the restaurant is definitely a throwback in time which I love. I had a vegan breakfast that our server and chef put together (tofu, home fries, beans, toast,) and  side of fruit and my friends had challah French toast and two eggs with kimchi rice and pork belly. Both enjoyed their meal. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is our go-to resto in our neighborhood. Great with kids (free on Sunday evenings!) and always great service. Highly recommend the brisket burger!"}
{"text":"Was it the lovely cherry blossoms at High Park that I just visited?  Was it just the awesome Roncy area?  Not sure exactly what it is but I loved my experience at the Ace, a gem on a street that's known for great food.

The old school diner decor was quite charming and we waited about 10 minutes for a table, having arrived 19:40 on a Wednesday night.  Reading Yelp it seems that the Ace is more known for breakfast/brunch but dinner was delicious as well. Booth was comfortable for two but may be a bit crammed for four.

Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts - yes this didn't sound appealing to me either, but reading great things from fellow Yelpers we decided to go for it.  I would venture to say it was my favourite dish of the entire evening.  Nicely seasoned, deep fried perfection, and you get a full veggie serving!

Bison Burger - served with salad and deliciously golden and crispy fries, being lower in fat than beef, I didn't expect it to taste so juicy and delicious.  The burger was topped with an onion ring and pickle.

Grilled Swordfish with Kale and Watercress - one of two seafood options and the swordfish was well-grilled and seasoned, and the vegetables were a perfect complement with a slightly creamy taste.  

Homemade Ice Cream (Matcha Green Tea) and Zucchini Cake with Oatmeal Homemade Ice Cream - we couldn't decide which dessert to share so the natural choice is to order both.  The Matcha, while good, was not as creamy as those you get in Japanese AYCE restaurants.  The Oatmeal Ice Cream, however was delicious and complemented the Zucchini Cake well (doesn't even taste like there's any vegetable in there, perfectly chocolatey).

Our cocktails - Salty Dog (tequila with grapefruit) and the Ace Old Fashioned were both relatively strong and well-concocted.  Bill with all of these came out to $100 for two, all in (note default tip is 20%).  Lovely experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pro:
- Poached Eggs
- Location
- Friendly Staff

Con:
- Prices

- home fries are too dry
- Portion Size
- Coffee tastes pretty bad"}
{"text":"Came back for dinner and wasn't disappointed!  However, it's similar to the brunch menu where only a few things caught my eye, and everything else seemed meh. Tried them all, but won't be coming back for a repeat visit anytime soon, only because there is a myriad of other restaurants along this strip that requires a visit. 

The dishes are simple, but does veer from the mundane with ingredients and sides like okra, grits, and pork belly (and of course the infamous zucchini cake).  

For appetizers we shared a plate of the buffalo fries (fries smothered in bbq sauce basically). Tangy, spicy, sweet. I would have ordered the pork belly if I didn't already indulge in that elsewhere last week. 

The lamb shank is perfection. Fall off the bone, tender, and flavourful. Served on top of grits. I don't like grits. 

The flatiron steak was also very good, and fries where fresh and crunchy too. 

For dessert, the zucchini cake wasn't as mind blowing as the peanut butter cake, but still moist and tasty. Loved the peanut butter cake!!

Service was great, even when it was so busy. Friendly and courteous, couldn't ask for anything more. Drink menu has only a few items on tap, but lots of bottle and can choices. Thornbury Cider. 

You can make reservations only for the front table and only for a party larger than 6. 

Although it was excellent, and you should come here at least once, i'm moving on to the next place on my list. It's not really a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Extremely overrated!
Waited an hour on two simple orders and they weren't even good. The burger was burnt on the outside and overcooked and dry on the inside. Their special mac and cheese omelette was a very uninspiring mac and cheese wrapped in a plain omelette. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Oh my god, the fries! Just perfect to me. Double fried to almost crunchy. Any more and they'd be burned but they're not. Soft in the middle. Come on a weekday for lunch and try a great club sandwich or a BLT. I've also been for brunch and it was fine (eggs benny), but I missed those fries. The place could do with a remodel/refresh but I'm so happy it's in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The kind of place the passive aggressive noob kitchen staff doesn't put the sautéed mushrooms inside the tortilla in your breakfast burrito, but will serve it on the side and still charge you 20$. The Hedley of pseudo-\"hipster\" west end restaurants and the staff looks like Hedley too! Go here if you want to go for brunch and use a bathroom without toilet paper or soap. I was hoping to find a pube in my home fries to top it all off, but I didn't have time, had to make my exit before I vomited up my mushroomless breakfast to their 1920s steam-jazz soundtrack. 
Keep on truckin! A real Ace on Roncy! 
Love the decour! Wow, so 70s! 
WASTE!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My friends and I were visiting Toronto and I wanted to try the Christmas burger that I saw on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. It was unique take on a turkey  burger and the turkey was very moist. To me, it felt more like Thanksgiving than Christmas. The cranberry sauce also complimented the burger well. That being said, it was a good dish, but it wasn't that good to the point where I was like OMG, I have to come back to Canada just to eat this again. Also, the other dishes were average as I can't even remember what else we ordered."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here before?! I'm not too too far from this restaurant, but man what a gem in Roncevalles neighborhood. I came for a lunch yesterday with a friend and when I stepped foot in the restaurant, it really reminded of the Senator near Yonge Dundas square. It has a antique, vintage, old school style feel, really quite something. Very narrow place too you'll know what I mean once you guys eat there. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos (comes in 3), and the veggie (portobello) burger with a side of fries. My friend and I split everything so I got to try both dishes. You know what happened? I kept saying \"mmm\" every time I bit into the burger, the fries and--you know what everything on the table! The food was so godlike I kept muttering \"mmm\" probably 20x if I can estimate.

The burger's sauce.... I think it's blue cheese paste? It was so strong but it worked so well in the combination. Now the fries. WOW. Texture-wise, it was perfect. I mean...the perfect fries. Perfect amount of salt, crispy-ness/crunch. I loved them. Now the tacos were pretty awesome too. It was a flavor party in my mouth, with guac, perfectly cooked beef...etc etc. Just fantastic.

I am actually checking out their brunch fairly soon since most of the reviews talk about that menu. But overall, great food, decent service (for the lunch shift), moderately priced..just go. go."}
{"text":"I went to The Ace for a quiet celebratory dinner for my first day on a job and I had a really great experience that I hope I get to repeat sometime soon.

The Ace was an old Chinese food restaurant left empty for years on the Roncesvalles strip so when you go inside, you can tell they tried to keep as much of the character as possible. The tables are quite small, little booths and the like. It's definitely a cozy place and locals have made it their own, kids run up and down the aisles, couples pepper the sides, people eat at bar stools on the side, it's a fully integrated restaurant. Do not go here if you want quiet alone time. You won't get it.

The beer is a touch pricier than I was expecting, but it seems this upward momentum of beer prices is across the board so I settled in for my $7 pint of Mill St Organic while my partner got a fantastic Old Fashioned for $10, leaving me really jealous.

But for dinner, I think I won. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken that came with corn bread and collard greens and I have to say, I was impressed. The chicken was perfect, not spicy unfortunately but it had that buttermilk flavour and it permeated throughout the piece. Salivating just thinking about it! The corn bread was great to sop up the sauce the collard greens rested on and those didn't last very long either. My partner got the steak frites which were good but we both agreed, mine was the clear winner of the evening.

For dessert we split chocolate pierogies and coconut saffron ice cream, they were both good but I think only the latter would I order again. They make all their ice cream and it's totaaaally working for them. 

Anway, great night, fantastic servers and staff who were friendly and warm. Really loved this place!"}
{"text":"The decor is excellent.  I had the fried chicken, as wisely recommended by the server.

We were disappointed with the high cost of drinks and that probably hastened our departure - to be frank.They have done a good job of maintaining that old antique feel, and the servers are cool, but why not offer an old-time whiskey sour or something neat and easy at a good price ...  that's all that is missing to make this place a very busy hangout..  Nice open kitchen, and overall vibe from an attentive staff."}
{"text":"Great food and cosy atmosphere in winter.

Would find it a bit dim for the summer months.

Servers were very strange - host told us she would be back to seat us in a minute (there were plenty of free tables) before a server arrived to say there was a 30 minute wait. The host then came back and seated us while the server looked on nonchalantly. 

Could do with a proper coffee machine."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night (Labour Day Monday to be exact) as I saw they had $1 corkage and buck a shuck oysters on Twitter.  Nice! I've never been to a resto where you can bring your own wine (not in Canada, anyway) so this was a bit of a fun adventure for me!

I had a nice bottle of white from my birthday that we figured we'd enjoy while having dinner, so we brought that. 

We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. Cool atmosphere, not much was fundamentally changed from this old Chinese restaurant till now... still old bar stools, low counter. I thought it was cool. The stools were a bit uncomfortable after half an hour or so... thankfully a table came up and we moved to a booth right in front of the kitchen.

We ate the oysters at the bar, the house sauces are great, nice flavour.  We ordered the rest of our meal when we got to the table.

The cocktails we ordered and drank before we opened our bottle of wine were really nice.  Some sort of tequila thing. 

For food, we ordered the Filipino dish of the night which was chicken adobo.. and for the other dish we ordered beef carpaccio.  We shared both.  The adobo was okay, two pieces of chicken, nicely seasoned, on top of jasmine rice and veggies.  The whole meal with tax was $57.   The food was good, not great, but I am willing to give it another try.

I would absolutely go back and try other things on the menu, especially on a Monday when they have the same deal. Great price and good atmosphere. The service was really good and overall I'm a fan of this cool little joint."}
{"text":"Ace is our go-to local restaurant. Relatively cheap, cozy atmosphere and good food. Only beef is that it's not very big and they won't do reservations so it can happen that you can't get a table on busy nights. 
But if you're there on a weeknight it's definitely worth making a trek here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot on Roncy (and I've live in the hood forever). Cocktails are inspired, service is helpful and food is homey and tasty. This is a pretty, cozy and incredibly unpretencious spot (I've only gone in the evenings).  So why not five stars, you ask? It suffers from what most restaurants on this strip are guilty of- very, very small and no ability to reserve in advance. This means that you either luck out at the (uncomfortable) bar for two or wait a silly amount of time in line which I refuse to do. If you ever wanted to come with a group of people, forget it unless it is at 5PM! That said, if you do get in, it is the perfect combination of helpful (but not hovering) service, atmosphere, cocktails and food."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my visit to Ace last night. The $15 buger was served on a wonderbread bun. You know those 3 inch buns of the softest doughiest crappest bread in the world. An the patty which did not extend past the edge of this tiny bun fell apart as I was trying to eat it. We ordered shots, they were short poured and the attitude we got when we pointed this out was huffy. The kicker came after 30 minutes in there and dropping over$100 we were asked to move to the bar to make room for other, apparently more desirable patrons. The bar by the way is very uncomfortable. The stools are fixed to the floor and there is not enought leg room. This means having to sit sideways and with only two seats at the bar my friend and I would be rubbing knees. The booths are flimsy and you feel every move of the person behind you. I have never experienced this is a restaurant ever. I just requested our bill and we left. I will never go back. It is full of hipsters anyway so I understand why they did not want to make me feel at home. Never have I woke up in a morning and the first thought that comes to mind is what a disgraceful experience I had at a restaurant the night before."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend on Sunday Feb 3, we sat at the bar. I had the ACE breakfast and the Challah french toast. They have a brunch menu that is different from their regular menu. The food was quick and tasted amazing. The staff was great, super friendly and very accommodating. Can't wait to try their regular menu, heard that their burgers were amazing!"}
{"text":"Lovely place! We took a short walk from High Park to get breakfast: 
The Ace Breakfast was very high quality, great brown toast, attentive details like 3 pieces of fresh fruit, two bacon types and great sausage! 
The atmosphere is very friendly, retro (like the furniture and Beatles music, there must be some original furniture)."}
{"text":"Great cute spot, however...was greeted with a cool reception from out waitress, when we asked for suggestions she replied with snarky remarks. Overall food quality was mediocre and the fried chicken was a far cry from southern hospitality...should be renamed 3 chicken fingers. Lamb shank was soft and tender but drowned in basic BBQ sauce. We didn't even make it to dessert because we couldn't take the negative attitude. Horrible service and average food...would not go back!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. This was on my list of spots to try in Toronto having read some glowing reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. I now see why others find The Ace quite charming. I loved the outside facade of this Roncey gem. The servers and hosts/hostesses were effortlessly chic and friendly. Some of them even had this Duffy-like aura. I mean, they did play a lot of Motown and 60s music (i.e. The Chiffons, The Supremes, Martha & the Vandellas) while we were there! (Gotta love retro chic!) 

Anyway, the food. Fantastic. The X-Mas Burger was a creative take on holiday flavors in the form of a hamburger --- and um, how great is it to have this available in June? AMAZING! It came with some fantastic fries. The strawberry basil margarita was everything! I wanted to have more and more... but my good boy side took over that night so I had one -- and enjoyed every sip of it. I loved the mixed china and marble tables. It really did feel like a diner, but one that is a la Rachel Ashwell. (That was soooo early 2000s of me to say that! Oh well. It sorta felt like her presence was with us that night!) Overall, we had a lovely (and substantial!) meal and I could not have asked for a better casual (dinner) night-out!"}
{"text":"Despite the hipsterish vibe, The Ace is one ace place to get your comfort food grub on. I've only been to the Ace a couple times for dinner, but every dish I've had has been pretty solid. I'd give highest marks to the steak frites and the country fried chicken, the latter of which is served boneless and perfectly crispy. The only criticism I'd have is that the last couple of times I've been, the ham gravy accompanying the chicken was on the lukewarm side, for some reason.  I also dig the autumn green salad, which is garnished with these super-addictive crispy chickpeas, which I could probably eat by the boatload. Love the classic craft cocktails here, too. However, if there's one thing you shouldn't miss, it's dessert. They serve homemade oatmeal ice cream that is to die for. I honestly wish they'd sell it by the tub, as I'd definitely make the trek out to Roncy more often just for that alone."}
{"text":"Very cosy little brunch spot. Came here for brunch and just finished eating my Ace Benedict. The place isn't super busy so you won't have to wait in line like over hyped place like Maha's. I ordered Ace Benedict, wasn't the best looking benny but can't complain about the taste. The potatoes on the side were little too big and crispier than I like. My gf didn't like her Huevos Rancheros that much but she super picky. 
Great service topped up the good Benny. The fact that it's close to my place I'm going to come here again."}
{"text":"While not yet \"as good as it gets\", 5 stars shows the potential this place will almost surely attain!  I can't in good conscience give less: 4.5 is closer the mark; 4 would do them a disservice.  Reason being while there's room for improvement, this revitalized Roncy relic really hit the ground running!

(That's a hell of a lot of Rs.  Yay for alliteration!)

Restored from a truly odd marriage of 50s diner and 80s Chinese Food Place, the owners (and their team of family and friends) really went the extra mile:  what they couldn't salvage for its original purpose, they re-purposed (check out the awesome wall-mounted tea lights!).  Seriously, this place is eye candy of the highest order (and I'm not talkin' about the servers or clientele, though surely there are plenty enough beautiful people milling about on a Saturday night).

It's small, equal parts cozy and sweaty, with a half-dozen bar seats, a half-dozen tables for two, a table (or two?) for four, and the large front table that seats eight pretty comfortably.  Note that they *do* take reservations, though I suspect this may not last as their popularity grows and the limited space demands greater turnaround.

As for the food, drinks, and service, while there are still some kinks to be ironed out -- hence the room for improvement -- they've got the foundation of something great.  

Some highlights and notables:

* Steak was asked for rare and arrived thusly, something I'm not accustomed to in this city.  With four of our table ordering the steak it's pretty impressive the small kitchen hammered them out in a timely fashion and perfectly cooked to boot!  All were nicely aged and damned tasty.  Highlight indeed!

* Fried chicken, three pieces with a mess of delicious collard greens and ham gravy... good but not great.  Two pieces were succulent and finger-lickin'; one piece was smaller and overcooked, suggesting their fryer-timing is still being fine-tuned.  The head chef, Peter, is apparently known for this dish and I'll guess it'll ultimately be a big win once the kitchen staff perfects it.

* Taro chips.  GET THE TARO CHIPS.  

* House Manhattan is an interesting take on the classic, though I found the cinnamon on the candied apricot garnish had permeated the drink too much for my traditionalist tastes -- no worries, it's easy enough to ask for a classic, dry Manhattan.

* Some very interesting house-made ice creams, including one made with Hockley Stout and another with bourbon.  \"Sweet\" indeed!  At $4 a pop they're on the pricey side for two adorable little scoops, but they're a fine -- and novel -- way to close out a meal and definitely recommended at least once.

* Service can be a bit slow, but it's exceedingly friendly.  These are good people looking to establish a new neighbourhood institution -- it really shows through in the way they interact with patrons (and each other).  Respect, friendliness, attentiveness, and appreciation.  They're not taking anything for granted and I love that.

Final curiosity:  On our first visit we were graced by a sit down from a staff-member (who asks to remain anonymous!) as the night wound down.  She cheerfully answered our questions, and relayed some very interesting stories... foremost being that The Ace is apparently haunted by the ghost of the previous proprietor of the Chinese joint... but the spirit is friendly, and happy to see the place jumping again. 

If you get a chance and they're not too busy, ask about the renovations, the ghost, and the general tale behind the place. The Ace boasts a good yarn, and it's worth a listen!  (Not to mention repeat visits!)"}
{"text":"Nice spot. Limited beer selection but good ones on the list. Service was friendly and food was good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here and those that like this place are right.  It is fun and kitschy.  Very small space but there was room at the count so I sat there. Patrons were friendly, as was the service.

Food was tasty.  I tired the Ace Benedict and it was taste. We don't get peameal bacon in the states and that's a shame. Tasty!! OJ is fresh squeezed and coffee is typical diner coffee. Not amazing, but strong enough to get you going."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last weekend with my momma.

It was super busy at The Ace so we decided to sit at the little bar setup. The ladies making the coffees were friendly and fixed our caffienated drinks quickly.

My mom ordered The Ace Breakfast and I selected the huevos rancheros. Our meals took a very long time to arrive (about 45 minutes), which we didn't necessarily mind as we were catching up and chatting on our mother/daughter date. 

When the food finally arrived however, I was kind of shocked at how small the portion of my meal was. My mom pointed out that this is probably all a human should eat at breakfast time (haha thanks mom!) but it was very disappointing to me as I was absolutely ravenous by the time the food got to me. The meal itself was tasty but I would have appreciated more salsa, beans, and gauc on the plate (see pic I uploaded).

The only other comment I should make is that the ladies seemed to be upset over someone they had working for them booking reservations when they supposedly don't take reservations. They had groups of customers coming in who had booked reservations with a live human at this restaurant only to be told rudely that was impossible as they are \"first come, first served.\" Try to keep the employee politics in the back room, accommodate your customers, and please don't talk about this while people are trying to enjoy themselves in your establishment, it was very awkward.

I would not go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"The Ace is excellent!

I came here for the first time after the High Park Spring Run-Off so naturally, I was ravenous. I had the Ace Breakfast which comes with the works - eggs, bacon, sausage, home-fries, toast, and black beans. To say that I was satisfied would be an understatement. It's rare to find a \"run-of-the-mill\" brunch joint do scrambled eggs properly, but this is it! The eggs were fluffy, buttery, and NOT runny; I'd come back for the eggs alone.

This place is on the smaller side and it was jam-packed on a Saturday morning. I'd prepare ahead if you want to come for breakfast during peak hours. I'm planning to be back here for dinner someday.

If you're in the High Park area, definitely give The Ace a try!"}
{"text":"This place is just plain old awesome.  Nothing fancy, just creative well composed food.  A place that packs this much character into such a small space has got to have something going for it.  It does get busy on most days, so plan on coming early or at least waiting for one of the very few tables.  There are a few bar seats and one 6-top at the front window.  

With a daily risotto there was always something on the menu for me.  The menu changes too much for me to belabor the great food, but in short the menu of staples like the Thanksgiving burger and the daily specials never fail.  Their cocktail list mirrors their menu, replete with classic cocktails, many stiff, but plenty not.

Desserts here might trump appetizers.  Checkout the chalkboard overhead and make sure you save room.  They change often, but the homemade ice creams are awesome.  You never know which flavor they'll have, but you almost can't go wrong with all the flavors they put out.  Plus, they once had a cookie ice cream sandwich that was to die for.

5 stars for really great food cooked right behind the counter.  It's almost not worth the wait and crowd to just come for a drink, so sit down and enjoy the most satisfying comfort food ever."}
{"text":"Been here twice for brunch and have to say that the food is only mediocre. It seems like a good local spot, but I wouldn't make the trip out to Roncy just for this place. The first time I came we had the steel cut oatmeal which was really tasty, unfortunately it's not on the menu anymore. The staff was very nice and friendly though, but I don't see why this is a place people line up for."}
{"text":"The Ace is a cozy spot for drinking with an intimate atmosphere. I find the staff to be quite warm and genuine people. I have not eaten here, so I cannot comment on their food, but word on the street has been all positive! Our server was Kevin, and he tested out his new cocktails on me (negroni's?) . They were delicious! He also included ghost stories for good measure. 

I love The Ace!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing cocktail menu that is worth the cost (around 11-13$ each) as well as great food. 

Love it here but it is small so it isn't the best place to bring more than 3 or 4 people. That is the only reason why it isn't 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food.

The waitress was nice and polite enough to let us stay eating until 3.30pm (technically when theyare closed)

We ordered the fried chicken bbq burger and the xrimas turkey burger. They were amazing with the fries and house salad. 

Waitress told us to next time try the oatmeal home made ice cream. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place by chance on a Saturday morning during brunch. (Ok, it was probably early afternoon, but they still served brunch.)

I had French toast, bacon, as well as a taste or two of Eggs Benedict.  The French toast had bananas and blueberries with it and was quite delicious.

Here's why I give The Ace five stars....

1. Everything about the brunch was generous. The French toast was a large portion. Other plates I observed were full of generous portions, whether they had salad, fruit, eggs, or whatever. The bacon side had plenty of bacon.
2. The coffee was befitting of a great breakfast place.
3. The menu had lots of options. If you like anything at breakfast, you will find it here.
4. The service was hospitable. So often, really cool looking places (Ace has a nice cozy vibe) have employees who are very cool as well, in fact, too cool to give you any decent service.  Not here. The service was really first rate. I never had to ask for a coffee refill or a kind smile.
5. Price. Ace offers value for the money. You can eat a cheaper breakfast somewhere else, but probably not find one quite as substantial for the money. For around $12-$16 you can leave here full.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Split the pork belly and grilled octopus dishes. The grilled octopus was just as described and very good. The pork belly was flash fried, which made it nice and crispy. Both dishes were very good.

Good ambience in the restaurant. Feels like a hybrid between a dining car and old school diner. Very unique.

Props to The Ace for having a nice micro brew list as well. Very impressive for a Roncy restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for lunch.  Had the Caesar Salad and P.E.I. Mussels with a glass of Italian Pinot. Delicious in every way. Others had the daily special which was a Chicken Pot Pie. I wish I had a bigger appetite and more time because it looked and smelled inviting. The beer and wine selection is varied despite being somewhat limited. Having said that, there is something for everyone with an agreeable price point. All of this adds up to four stars. What makes it five is the service and ambience. I felt welcomed and never rushed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went exploring on a frigid winter day and landed at this place for brunch.

Saturday around 12pm, we were seated within 10 minutes.

The drinks are phenomena (don't judge me)!  Of note was the passion fruit mimosa.

We ate:
- Eggs benny with Parmesan leek sauce (4/5)- while delicious, it was a little heavy.
- Pork belly fried rice concoction (4/5)- Yummy! I wish the kimchi was a bit more potent but this was definitely a-okay.

This place has a retro dinner feel, and the prices are uber resonable. I will be back ( for that mimosa)."}
{"text":"The is going to be short because I am feeling lazy but The Ace has the best brunch and brunch staff in the entire city.     I know that is a big claim and I stand behind it.   Go, see if I am wrong"}
{"text":"The food is great. You can see the cook make the food if your closer to the back. I was way too full to try their desert but i heard its their big seller."}
{"text":"I must admit, I avoided this place for a while because I thought it would be yet another pretentious hipster joint full of disappointments.  While bf and I waited for a table at Barque down the street (a favourite) last night, we decided to venture down and check it out.  Surprisingly, a small booth was available at about quarter to 10 on a Friday night.  The place was busy but not crowded, and the staff were immediately welcoming and pleasant.  The overall ambiance was not what we anticipated, in the best way possible.  It's warm and cozy with great music and attentive staff.  While bf had a few pints of beer, I tried some cocktails, the Ace Manhattan and a Pimm's Cup.  Both arrived very quickly and were delicious.  We then ordered Buffalo Fries to share, and were worried that they'd be a tiny portion.  Instead a decent sized bowl arrived a short while later.  While we can't rate a full-out meal here, since we have yet to try one, I would highly recommend this spot for drinks and snacking!"}
{"text":"This place was good and had a nice old fashion feel. 

Came here for breakfast on a Saturday and got a seat relatively easily. Got a burrito and home fries and my friend got a grilled cheese and home fries. The burrito and the grilled cheese were both good, but definitely something you could easily recreate at home for less than $10. The home fries were delicious! They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and perfectly salted (something that is seriously underrated). 

Service was friendly and the place was cozy, a cute place on Roncesvalle."}
{"text":"Very good, the staff and the nostalgia factor make for a great ride down memory lane.  the food was pretty delicious too.

thank you"}
{"text":"What a gem!  This place is quirky, country, roadside feel with best comfort food yet.  Though hard to find a parking space, this restaurant as well as the strip are worth the trouble to enjoy a relaxing afternoon of great food, relaxation and sights.

Tried the Ace Country - fried chicken and flapjacks and it's delicious.  Bit of maple syrup with a tangy slaw balances out this heavy dish just right and this is a brunch menu item!  Could have fooled me because it seems easily ordered as dinner too! 

At $16, it is great value and wonderful creativity from chef and staff."}
{"text":"My go to place for brunch just before going to high park. Their prices are a little steeper than its local competition but I still prefer this place to others. 

I love their weekend omelettes as it changes it each time I come and I love the variety. Their omelettes are nice and fluffy with generous amounts of toppings. Home fries are great. 

I also like how the kitchen is open concept so I can see how the chefs work. When its open kitchen the chefs have no choice but to work clean, so thats an added bonus."}
{"text":"This was the place my boyfriend took me to on our first date so I could be a little biased. But it was the best date spot I could've asked for:) Dimly lit romantic vibe, but also laid back and pretty casual at the same time.  

I usually order the Christmas burger (no matter what time of year). I'm never disappointed. The chicken entree also amazing. 

Near Christmas last year, they had mulled cider and I was in heaven. Theres always something new and exciting to try."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago and loved the food. Arrived here at 11AM and only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table. The place is cozy with not a lot of seating so I can see how there might be a wait for a table. 

We ordered the Challah French  toast, pork belly and my friend got the ace breakfast but vegan. Seriously so good. The challah bread really worked as French toast and the combination of the fruits (caramelized banana and berries) and maple syrup just made it awesome. The pork belly was also a great savoury dish. It seems almost out of place in terms of the rest of the menu but it tasted great. The scallion and kimchi fried rice was really great and the pork belly was cooked well, not rubbery at all.

Definitely will be back for brunch again!"}
{"text":"GREAT STAFF!!!!
I went in to sample their Christmas Burger but it was not on the menu, everything else sounded just as good.  After expressing my disappointment, the waiter inquired with the chef and he said as long as your willing to wait for it, he can whip it up....

Pleasantly pleased and truly grateful, not only did i get the burger but my dining mate was giving a quick wine sampling as she found something she liked.

if not for one thing, the staff was kind, gracious and truly helping in answering questions about the menu.

I THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE

P.S.
DID I MENTION GOOD DRINKS!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a party of nine people in which three of them were children. Definitely not the best location for group of our size and not very family-friendly. This place is not quite my style but appreciate what they are doing. The food and service were both very good."}
{"text":"My friends took me to this place a couple of weeks ago. We're all students on a budget, but twice a month we treat ourselves to a meal at an trendy restaurant we haven't tried yet. When we got to The Ace at around 8 o'clock, we found it completely filled, but the host took our name and number and said that he would call when a table freed up allowing us to walk around lovely Roncy instead of blocking the door and waiting.

My friends ordered the Christmas Burger, the Mac'n'Cheese Burger, I ordered the Fried Chicken with Collared Greens and we shared the Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts to start. The portions were perfect (even though at the end of the meal we all felt the urge to unbutton our pants) and we were all very happy with our meal. 

The service was pretty wonderful. Our waitress didn't even argue when we asked for our bill to be seperated into equal parts (which it seems is an insane request to most people in the food industry in Toronto). She answered all our questions about the dishes we had and had great advice when it came to the deserts (homemade ice cream).

All in all everything was good, but it was by far not the best I've ever had which I expect for the 25 dollars I paid for fried chicken, the cheapest greens out there and cornbread. If your concept is \"comfort food done right\" as it seems to be, it needs to be done to perfection if you decide to charge that price for it."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here this Saturday at the suggestion of friend to catch up.  Although the restaurant was busy the entire time we were there, we were fortunately seated right away when we arrived around 1:30 p.m; there was always a few people waiting to be seated.  Brunch is served at The Ace on Saturdays and Sundays until 3 p.m.

As many have said, the place had a \"kitschy\" ambiance.  I don't usually go to diners, but I'm always up to try somewhere new that friends suggest. The diner was narrow, had a small open kitchen and lined with small booths.  Service was really friendly and the space was cozy.  I ordered the Ace Benedict - two poached eggs with parmesan leek fondue & peameal bacon, served on an english muffin with home fries and a couple slices of fruit.  Delicious plate...enjoyed every bite.  Coffee was regular diner coffee.   The only trivial or inconsequential detail to most is that the smell of food and the small diner was trapped in my long hair...I could smell the diner in my hair and clothes when we stepped out of the restaurant.  Otherwise, friendly, very casual brunch spot with great prices."}
{"text":"I tried this place out based on the yelp reviews of others and I used to pass it going to another restaurant up the way a bit but never tried it. I enjoyed my meal but I find their menu very limited and the price a but high, I mean $3.50 for iced tea is crazy in my eyes. My appetizer, the PEI Mussels was great. My meal which was the BBQ Chicken was small, I had more salad on my plate than sandwich. I had some of the homemade ice cream as well and it was ok. The server was great and I gave a higher than usual tip but for what I ate, and what my 40 bill became it seemed a bit steep."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all of the restos on the Roncy strip. Cue a visit to The Ace. I waited outside for my companion not realizing that there was actually a wait. Once I got my name down on the list we waited for about 20 minutes to be called. The only seats available were at the bar and barely that because one stool was basically behind the bar. We shifted over once some other diners left but it wasn't that much more comfortable. 

The service was prompt if not particularly friendly. The menu was also small and fairly pricey.  If I'm going to pay $16 for a veggie burger I expect that it's not going to be served on a white Dempsters hamburger bun. What a disappointment. 
My dining companion got the Thanksgiving burger also served on the same type of bun. The food was nonetheless tasty, especially the fries that accompanied our meal. 

This was definitely a try once and don't bother returning kind of place. There are plenty of other places on the strip with food that is better value for money."}
{"text":"Tucked away a midst the revitalization of Roncy, The Ace is another one of Toronto's little gems.

From the food perspective, this place knows what it's doing. Dinner artichoke appetizer turns artichoke haters into lovers. Salad options are fresh, simple and not over dressed. Dinner entree's highlight new takes on traditional dishes, with a special shout out to the lamb shank and steak frites. When a restaurant makes its own homemade icecreams and desserts, you know the chef is in it from start to end. 
Everything we had was extremely good and for the pricing, you really can't go wrong.

The atmosphere is perfectly Toronto. In a city where half the restaurants are  focusing more and more on modern spaces with year half livs on ambience, The Ace does the opposite and supports the casual relaxed this-is-a-what-a-neighbourhood-restaurant-should-feel-like. I personally find myself drawn to places like this. The servers are attentive, informative and just down right cool. The place almost feels like an American dinner in a French city. Mismatched plates and kitchy little things makes you feel like you're at home. 
This would be a great place to catch up with friends, go out with family, go on a date, feel warm in the winter. 

Well done to the chef, servers and owners."}

{"text":"This place is so lovely! If you want comfort food, this is the place. 
And it was restaurant number 8 crossed off my Restaurant resolutions list. 
http://wp.me/p1t9bx-k0


VIBE 
Yes, I have to say it. So hipster. It is a long, narrow diner with plenty of booths and stools at the bar. Really funky wallpaper adorns the walls and you can see the cooks working their magic in the back. It's dimlit in here and perfect on a grey or breezy night. Great for a casual date or catch up with a friend. 

WE ATE
Warm bread and olives were comforting and I'm glad we got them because it took a while for our food to come. If you're in a rush, maybe this is not the place for you. 
I had the fried chicken. It's not Stockyards but I gobbled it up! It felt like my grandmother's recipe. Yum and YUM. 
I mistakenly thought Mac and Cheese was on the menu -- only the children's menu. Bring it for the adults! 
My dining partner had the mussels and fries. I had a fry and they were thick and fresh and lovely. He seemed to enjoy the mussels. It was quite the bowl. Portions are just the right size to fill you up but not leave you stuffed. 
After hearing that they had nutella perogies on the menu, we had to try them. What a creative dish! They were delish but they were not \"wow\" and a brown perogie may not be the most visually appealing. That said with some creme fraiche, lovely! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
The Ace is ace. It seems like a lot of people are going here for brunch. Maybe I'll try it when the crowds die down? This place really does feel like the new Swan."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. Neatly tucked in a cute little street, in a cool part of Toronto you have to look to find it.  The place has a very chill vibe in a refurbished old diner which definitely pays homage to its roots.  We were served by Buffy who was just as awesome as you think someone with the name Buffy would be.  She guided us through our food and drink options making sure our experience was well rounded and we got a good range of items.  Everything was really awesome, the standouts were the ceviche (which changes daily), the shrimp and grits, the ribs (which were the daily special) and the after ace cocktail which was beyond!  And you definitely want Buffy to help you out, so make sure you ask for her!"}
{"text":"The Ace is a super cute diner in roncey. It's hip, it's romantic, it's neat. I really just love it. I've eaten here 3 times (brunch twice and a dinner). The food has been consistently good and they have really unique menu items (kimchi eggs, cranberry and stuffing turkey burger). I'm not sure if the Ace took over another old dinner or just made this place look like a 50s diner, but it's got a really great vibe. There's not a ton of seating but they do take reservations (at least for now)."}
{"text":"We came to the Ace for dinner on a Wednesday night.  

Note, they only take reservations for groups of six or more for the front window table.  The rest of the seating is first come, first served.  This was not a problem when we arrived around 7pm.  We were able to grab one of the last available booths near the back.

Our friendly server dropped off menus and then came back for drink orders.  We got 2 glasses of wine ($10/each) and once we heard the specials, we ordered the steak frites entree ($21) and the special trout appetizer ($11).  One of the dinner specials was a burger topped with mac&cheese ($13) which I thought was intriguing.

Atmosphere was old school diner, definitely kitchy and cute.  A bustling dining room filled with lots of hungry patrons, just like the days of yore.

Not too long of a wait for our meals.  The steak frites was excellent.  Steak done medium rare as requested and the fresh cut fries were good as well.  The meaty gravy that coated the steak tasted great on the fries.  The trout appetizer came on a bed of salad.  Simple but good, my DC wished it came in an entree size.

For dessert, we had to try some of the homemade ice creams ($4/each).  We got the Mexican hot chocolate and the raspberry sorbet.  The hot chocolate flavor had a hint of cinammon and the raspberry was tart but refreshing.  Both great and the two tiny scoops of each didn't last too long.

Ventilation in the Ace could be improved.  We sat close to the open kitchen and when we left, we were wearing the scent of our dinners.  It required a full body shower and airing of my coat outside to get rid of the smells.

As soon as we payed our bill, we were requested by another server to vacate our table and finish up at the bar so that new customers could be seated.  I understand the importance of turnover on a busy night and I respect it.  We were on our way out and not intending to linger but give me a chance to put on my jacket.  DC was not impressed, felt like we were being ushered out the door.

Solid 3.5 stars for good food and kitchy atmosphere.  Happy to see new places pop up on Ronccy now that the streetcar tracks are repaired."}
{"text":"One of the best eggs beenys I've had. 
I loved the atmosphere, the service was great and food + drinks were all excellent. Big portions. 
Not a big place so you might want to get there early to grab a table. Will most definitely go back. 
Also, a short walk to high Park."}
{"text":"Loved the French toast and coffee! We went around 10 on a Sunday and there were plenty of seats . In lovely neighbourhood- perfect for an after breakfast walk ! The huevos rancheros could have been more flavourful . We were able to find parking for free on  the side streets."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an inviting, low key, and relaxed diner with personality, this would be your place for brunch.  We arrived fairly early on a Sunday morning (just before 10 am) and snagged a free table that just finished.  Though its no where as crazy as Lady Marmalade for line up but there was a steady stream where of families to keep a waiting list going.

This closely reminds me of Lady Marmalade except Ace a bit more hip, chill, and considerably less little kids running about.  We maybe had 1 table here with a child ... whereas Lady Marmalade was a near zoo with much food tossing and little feet pittering and pattering.  Ace does not have a lot of tables... mostly tables of 3 people.  You could push 4 into an area if you know each other really well.  It's not well lit so for those who are avid food picture takes (ahem me...) it really pushes your photo editing skills to the limit.  

Service here is really friendly ... they have this great relaxed vibe that you feel you could just open with a funny story of your day and they'll love it.  There are definite regulars here and you can see in the way they interact in the staff that it's their perfect spot.  Almost like old friends.

The menu here is not very big but its fairly well curated.  We came for the French Toast so that was not negotiable and I got their daily omelette (kale & brie) with a good cup of coffee & the Pluck Muskoka Chai tea.  Before I get into the food, this place does tea and coffee pretty good... you don't get coloured water but actually enough tea leaves and spices to make a good cup.

Blueberry caramelized banana french toast - Soft challah bread that are soaked in custard and grilled up nicely but leaving the interior quite eggy soft.  The caramelized bananas add a wonderful flavour and the blueberries give it a nice sweet tart berry note to it.  Though this didnt come with syrup or much powdered sugar, I think it hit the right sweet notes.  4.5/5

Kale Brie omelette - it came with a generous portion of breakfast potatoes (really fries but in chunks).  The addition of the hot sauce made it a hearty meal as the omelette was a fair portion.  I did feel there was not much brie at all in there but I was happy with seeing some greens peak through.  I liked how the omelette wasn't overcooked or rubbery.  4/5

Definitely come here for the relaxed easy Sunday brunches and indulge in a very good french toast.  I would say it's definitely in the top 5 and with the prices fairly reasonable and the wait not too bad, this is a good decent spot to keep on your regular brunch rotation."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service!! We had the fried chicken (so juicy) and the mussels (unexpectedly delicious mustard in the white wine sauce). Spot on."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot. Delicious take on eggs benny - loved the Parmesan leek sauce instead of instant hollandaise."}
{"text":"The Ace is our go to spot for brunch for the friendly staff and the mouth watering food!

We honestly have never been disappointed with anything on their menu, but if it's your first time I'd recommend the BLT (add egg), the banana blueberry French toast, or the Croque Madame. If you find yourself with some home fries or anything else thats a vehicle for aggressive dipping ask for their dill mayo 

What makes us come back so regularly is that the experience goes beyond the food. Everyone who works here is always so friendly! And seeing the chef at work with such a buzzing energy is always great to see. You really feel like there's a lot of love that goes into her cooking. Anytime we have friends or family visiting, we take them here because it's consistently such an enjoyable experience.

Hands down, best brunch in roncey / parkdale / high park!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch.  The french toast was to die for.  We were lucky and got a table right away, but as we were leaving at 1pm, there was quite a line up at the front.  Friendly staff, and great service as well."}
{"text":"My second time here, the bar provides seating for 8 with direct access to the server.

The beef burger was sweet, spicy and overall excellent. The pork was slightly over cooked served with potato gratin, unremarkable.

I think the ACE offers a great place to get away, sit close to your partner in a little booth and enjoy Roncy's trendy life."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a neighborhood gem, especially after reading the Yelp reviews...but alas, the much-recommended chicken was a bit of a dud.  It was heavily breaded and dry.  The \"gravy\" was flavorless and spare as well.

The spinach was fine, but not spectacular.

The waitress offered dessert on the house due the palpable disappointment.  This was a nice gesture, but the bourbon ice cream was a bit long in the tooth and had large ice crystals.  Flavor good, shelf life bad.

Service was excellent and this is a very cute place...but the food was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Mr.Bf and I sauntered in after a positive apartment search in Roncesvalles on a Tuesday evening.  It was quite busy but there was room at the bar--the ambience is super relaxed, retro diner-style, perfect for a summer evening.  We were later seated at a table, and the staff were just the right amount of attentive.

The cocktail list was enticing, but so was their beer selection--a Flying Monkey IPA for him, Erdinger for me.  I ordered the ahi tuna spaghetti special, with roasted olives and tomatoes.  It was very flavorful, although I would have liked pitless olives so I could more easily combine the olive flavour with the pasta.  Bf got the arctic char, which looked great.

For dessert we ordered the chocolate perogies, which are cuteso little dumplings made from chocolate dough, stuffed with nutella, and served with a side of whipped cream-as-sour cream and some pecans.  The warm nutella bursts in your mouth as you bite through the perogies--it was the highlight of the meal!  

I'd definitely be back.  The whole experience was laidback, and the food seemed thoughtfully executed.  Another hole-in-one for the Roncesvalles yuppie strip!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Really I did.

But the thing about The Ace is that no cute vintage décor or good menu graphic design will make up for terrible service and mediocre food. I'm sorry, but an antique bottle of Pepsi syrup carefully displayed with other vintage nicknacks from the Williamsburg flea market won't make my coffee come any faster or my dish arrive as ordered.

We tried this place out for brunch on a Sunday and there was a little bit of a line up at the entrance. I initially thought it had to do with the fact that the place was jamming, but I quickly realized that the hostess was spending her time complaining with the other staff members about some issue related to one of their dinner reservations rather than seating people. 

We were generally ignored for the first 15 minutes and watched more than half of the tables clear out or the restaurant before seating ourselves. Someone finally came to take our order after we had been sitting down at the main counter for about ten minutes (it wasn't like we were hidden in the back corner) and then they not only screwed up our food order but never brought us the coffees that we had ordered. 

By the time we got the right dishes (about 5 minutes apart), the food was meh. My huevos rancheros were decent but the quote unquote Montreal bagel dish was dry and bland and really not up to par (especially for Montreallers who know what a bagel is supposed to taste like).

I hate leaving shitty reviews, especially for small little independent spots like this one, but the truth is that it was probably one of the worst dining experiences I had had in a really long time. 

I will not be going back. F all that."}
{"text":"This little joint is located in a trendy neighborhood a little ways from the downtown area but you have to go here. The food is all fresh and you will love the atmosphere. The the chefs are fast on point with their choice of flavors. Got to try their pork belly and fried rice with eggs.

The staff is friendly; however, the space is a little tight and you will likely have to wait for a table. Therefore, I recommend getting there earlier than the typical breakfast, lunch, and dinner rush hours."}
{"text":"We have just discovered the Ace, and are so happy that we did!
Have been there for brunch twice now. Once with friends, and once with family - both times accompanied by our infant daughter. The staff are extremely accommodating when it comes to finding a spot for the car seat and stroller.
Food is excellent!! Can personally attest to the omelette special (wild mushroom and goat cheese when we went), the BLT, the eggs benny and the tea biscuits. YUM! 
Even though the extra egg on my BLT was forgotten, the waitress was so apologetic that she comped our coffees. 
Really really impressed with the food and the service here. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"What no reviews? Well let me be the first to say, \"GO!\". We had the Fried Chicken and the Lamb Shank. Both were delish! The lamb was braised in a lovely sauce. The batter on the Chicken was perfect! 
It's a fun casual atmosphere with good music. Not too expensive. I will go back. In fact, I tried to go last night but it was packed! It's no wonder.

Also, the hot bourbon apple cider was a great warm me up on the cold night we were there.

Nice staff, attentive and funny."}
{"text":"Being on the Top 10 New Brunch Places on BlogTO,  i decided to try this place out.  We got there and the only seating was along the counter so we took it, it's really warm inside but it's also right by the door, so beware of freezing winds every time the door opens - and it opens a lot because it's pretty busy!
i decided to try the green eggs and ham which was basically a sandwich.  The eggs were indeed green with pesto and arugula, very tasty, not too overpowering with pesto and the eggs were really nice and fluffy.  Side of potatos and a bit of fruit.  Yummy!  My date got the special which was a hash - he thought it was really good and from my bite it was - not quite as meatylicious as other hashes but good nonetheless.
I don't usually drink alcohol so early but the hungover looking guys beside me decided to get caesars -and  they looked daaaaamn good!  Garnished with an olive and a green bean, they were delicious looking - and the guys agreed so definitely on my list for next time!"}
{"text":"The menu is very interesting. I had Cassoulet which was delicious and the wife had the \"Xmas burger\" which was a full turkey dinner in a burger. Very strange but surprisingly delicious. Service is excellent. Cool atmosphere. Good coffee."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and vibe of the Ace.  It is warm and intimate, a place that makes you want to linger.

The cocktails are fantastic but the huge standout for me were the deep-fried brussels sprouts.  I say this because I hate brussel sprouts.  I mean I have never, ever tried one I liked.  As a kid, my mother prepared them a thousand ways convinced that she could make me like them but it in vain.  So understand that I tired one of these very reluctantly.  They are amazing - so incredibly good.  This achievement alone is worth 4 stars in my book. 

 I also really loved the Kale salad which was served with goats cheese and chick peas and was very flavourful.  As a main, the grilled octopus is spectacular and the ceviche is very good.   

A great choice for a dinner or drinks with a small group or date."}
{"text":"My favourite place is roncy or junction. Great servers, stellar food and one of the best vibes anywhere. It's perfect for a date or one buddy fancy drink session. I wouldn't recommend large groups. It's intimate, great music... And you'll feel way cooler for having been."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, but this visit was another in a series of over-priced disappointments on Roncy.

Only one dish was interesting and enjoyable, their deep-fried brussel sprouts appetizer. Their signature fried chicken managed to be greasy the outside and dry on the inside. The burger was no better."}
{"text":"The Ace is aces. 

If you've had the time to read through my (really excellent) reviews, you know that I crush hard on places with booths. High end diners with cocktail lists and old classics always sit well with me, and The Ace falls into this coveted category.

I popped in for lunch with my buddy Kent P. He had their famous burger, I had a kale salad with fried chicken and I can't wait to come back for a weekend breakfast or an evening drink in a diner booth."}
{"text":"First time at The Ace and it was really good! Had the Bison Burger which was tasty and cooked well. A little pricey in my opinion. 

Saved room for dessert and had the Skor pie which was INCREDIBLE. Rich, buttery toffee with Ritz cracker crust and chocolate on top."}
