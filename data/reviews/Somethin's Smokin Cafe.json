{"text":"Decided for a last attempt. 
The ribs were much better, but still not better than most places. I don't know how they smoke things there, but it's inconsistent.
However, I can say that this time my ribs were at least better than other local places. Still too overpriced, but I at least got 6 tender bones. Not 4 bones that were riddled with bone shards and chewy like the last visit.
The sides are still sub-par, but at least the meat improved. I suggest they give up on smoked Mac n Cheese. It's still not good.
One pet peeve I have is that there is no sauces to sample to see what you like. Asking for sides of sauce seems painstaking to the line-prepper. And to top it off, the tiny cups of sauce they do give you, they squeeze like halfway full. I just ordered a half slab and they give me 2 half full sides of sauce that would barely cover 3 bones?!
If you're gonna serve the meat without sauce, than don't offer an array of sauces that you don't even want to let customers try. 
They still have a lot of work, but at least I can say that on my latest visit, my food improved. 
Please keep improving! 

Oh, a friend ordered the brisket sandwich and it is still very tasty and a generous portion. It was good to see at least a little positive consistency."}
{"text":"As most have said, the BBQ was very much lackluster. I live near Lakewood so when I saw this place pop up I was pumped. So pumped that I went the day before they opened to get a look at the place. I saw the employees inside preparing for opening day putting slabs of ribs in foil and into what looked to be some type of warmer. Still, I was anxious to try it so I came back with my girl the next day to give it a go. We got a full slab of ribs with no sauce (to get an idea of the meat flavor) and the baked beans and regular smoked Mac n cheese. 
The employees were nice but like someone else said, being that it was their first day own they weren't very energetic our hospitable. They mainly held side conversations with one another and didn't engage the customers. We took our food to go as the inside of the restaurant wasn't much of a welcoming atmosphere. When got home and cracked the seal on the container we were underwhelmed. The ribs were very dry  and had no seasoning that we could taste. I forget what sauce we got on the side but it had a very vinegar like taste and was as watery as vinegar. Not really saucy and it didn't \"stick to the meat\". 

Feeling let down by that we tore into the sides. The baked beans were pretty basic. The highly touted smoked Mac n cheese was a complete letdown. First, considering we ordered the full slab that comes with two sides, the sides were in the smallest stingiest container I've ever seen. You'd think the size would coincide with the amount of meat we got. Second, it was a good thing they were so small because that Mac was awful. Loaded with smoke flavor but not cheesy at all. I wanted to love this place but I couldn't fake it. I don't want to write this place off so maybe I'll keep an eye on the reviews and see if they improve. I just can't see myself spending that kind of money off such poor food and experience. Til then I'll stick to the BBQ joints in the hood or Famous Dave's"}
{"text":"I had a really disappointing lunch here. I work nearby and had been curious to check this place out. I went the first week they were open so I will cut them some slack. I ordered a turkey burger with goat cheese. Smoked mac and cheese and coleslaw as sides. I received an almost warm turkey burger with no cheese and was totally dried out. It was cooked before I arrived and had obviously been sitting for a while. I had a few bites and quit. The portion sizes for the sides were lackluster. The coleslaw was totally flavorless. I thought there was no way the Mac and cheese would be bad. It broke my cheese filled heart. I can usually be mollified by the lamest of macaroni and cheeses. Not this time. Again, it was barely warm. The noodles were really, really soft with no detectable cheese. Maybe it had absorbed into the macaroni? Maybe the cheese won the lottery and jetted off to the Bahamas? I'll never know. The worst part was the smoked flavor. It was overpowering. I probably had four bites and had to stop. Those few bites were enough to make me taste the smokiness for the rest of the day. Very unpleasant. I thought that taste would never go away. It was what I imagined drinking Liquid Smoke would be like. In the end, I ate a Pop Tart and cried on the inside. I'll wait a few months and will give them another try. Super curious to see how other customers fare in the meantime."}
{"text":"Pros - service was quick & friendly. Mac & cheese was decent

Cons - my meat selection was very bland on its own. Most smoked & but meat is tasty on its own. The sauces they offer(which are supposed to make up for the blandness) are also awful, I tried two different sauces, both were supposed to be spicy, neither was spicy or flavorful including the one with sriacha in its name :(

My first visit is telling me not to come back which is unfortunate because I would really like to have a good bit option in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I was glad to see a BBQ place open up on Detroit Rd. because it is close to work for me, and I relish having lunch options. I was excited to try this place out, but unfortunately it did fall shy of my expectations. 
The service is quick, and the menu has a good variety, but there are several cons with this place. I feel that the prices are a bit high, compared to other take-out BBQ-type places I have been to in the past. I tried the smoked chicken sandwich with the smoked mac n' cheese. The sandwich was decent, although I felt that it could have used considerably more sauce, and a bit more seasoning in the meat overall. The man n' cheese is worth trying, but a little strong on the smoky flavor. 
The interior of this place also comes off a bit confused with the cartoon rock band murals."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a BBQ place open up right down the street from me! I grabbed some food from Somethin's Smokin on my way to work this past Saturday, and it smelled so good in the car that I couldn't wait to eat. I ordered 6 smoked wings with their Guys Original sauce (gluten/sugar free), and they were fantastic - huge, full wings, smothered with sauce. I'm not sure how hot (temperature) the wings were when I received them, because everything was about at room temperature by the time I got around to eating. Regardless, they were still awesome, and were served with extra sauce on the side, along with celery (only two pieces - ehh), and either bleu cheese or ranch, which I found unnecessary (everything was so good already). I ordered a side of coleslaw in addition to the wings, choosing the second-smallest size (they have several size options available), which was perfect except for the coleslaw was so good that I definitely could have eaten more! I paid about $9.50 for all of this, which I think is a great price.

A few suggestions that I have include adding more options for side dishes, for example collard greens or brussels sprouts with bacon, mashed sweet potatoes/squash, etc. The sides that they currently offer are smoked mac & cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, and side salads, and all of the sandwiches come with your choice of two sides. I love that they already offer a gluten free BBQ sauce, and a greater variety of grain-free sides would definitely make this place MUCH more appealing to me. I would also like to see their menu offer platters of smoked meat with the guest's choice of side, in addition to their extensive list of sandwiches. As Lakewood is full of sandwich places, I was really excited to see something different pop up and slightly disappointed when I saw that, for example, the pulled pork and beef brisket on their menu are only suggested in sandwich form. Finally, I agree with Eric S. that Somethin's Smokin should have a station where customers can sample sauces as they please. I have seen this at other similar restaurants and it seems to work well.

I truly hope this place uses constructive criticism to their advantage, and that they stick around for a long time! I am looking forward to a return trip, and will be happy to see Somethin's Smokin succeed."}
{"text":"On just about every street corner in Lakewood you can find a good burger. Lakewood is a burger town, so I was excited to see a new BBQ joint open up in the form of Somethin's Smokin. It moved into the Bailey Building a couple weeks ago in the spot that was formerly supposed to be Moe's Southwest Grill. My wife and I went in today and I had high hopes. I'll cut right to the chase. If you are looking for REAL barbecue, you might want to continue your search. That's not what you are getting here. 

I ordered the Smoked Chicken Sandwich, which came with two sides. I chose the Smoked Mac and Cheese and the Barbecue Baked Beans. My wife ordered the Brisket Sandwich and chose a side salad with Parmesan Balsamic Dressing and the mac and cheese. My sandwich was INCREDIBLY dry. It had clearly been sitting under some sort of heating element for a while. The sides were very skimpy, just a little larger than a Dixie Cup. My wife's brisket was not bad, not super tender but serviceable. The mac and cheese was rather bland and the baked beans were also serviceable but nothing to write home (or on Yelp) about. She did really enjoy the Parmasean Balsamic Dressing however, so there's that.

I will say that they do offer a varied selection of what appeared to be homemade barbecue sauces: Smokin's Chocolate Stout BBQ, Bayou Bite Sauce, Smokie Joe's Ginger BBQ, Carolina BBQ, Spicy BBQ, Bourbon BBQ, Guys Original Gluten Free Sugar Free BBQ -- I had the Carolina (mustard based) my wife had the Bourbon BBQ, both not bad, but they give them to you not on the meat but in a separate and very small container (even smaller than the Dixie Cup sides. Why not have them on the table in a squeeze bottle or at pump station enabling the customers to sample the eclectic flavors?

The last issue was price. For two sandwiches, each with two very small sides and two 20oz bottles of Root Beer (that's right no refills) the total came to $22.00 and some change. Meanwhile our food came in plastic baskets with pre-wrapped plastic-ware and napkins. 

To sum up, the food was rather dry and a bit overpriced. The decor gives off a cafeteria vibe, no music was playing and the people working, although not rude, did not give the \"we're new in town and here to wow you with our service\" vibe. I expected a lot more. Worst of all I came home from a BBQ joint, still hungry, and that is the greatest culinary sin of all."}
{"text":"I love BBQ Brisket - and the lack of any places in Lakewood (or much in the Cleveland area for that matter) means I will let a lot slide. Even though SSC is lacking, I'd still consider having their brisket again. With the Mac and Cheese being horrible, it makes return trips a lot more doubtful.

Down in Columbus, we have local favorite Ray Ray's Hog Pit. It's amazing and as legitimate as it comes. They smoke the meat over wood in big metal pits on site, giving it a big smoke ring and big flavor. 

SSC doesn't slow cook over wood off site like I figured before I went in. They are doing it all on site in a metal box with some sort of pellets. The resulting brisket is lacking the pink smoke ring and the deep smokey flavor. No burnt ends or other tell tale signs of smoked BBQ.

What's really disappointing is the mac and cheese. They smoke it with the brisket -- it really lacks being cheesy - and with the smoked flavor, it's just bad and dry. Not what I want to eat with my brisket. 

Given they decided to rent a gigantic space, I don't expect this place to be around very long which, like the mac and cheese, is also a bit disappointing. I don't understand how a place that doesn't serve booze thinks they need a giant restaurant when a small place like the old hot dog shop /Falafel Cafe next to Chipotle would have been the right size."}
