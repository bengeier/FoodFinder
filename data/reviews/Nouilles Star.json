{"text":"Horrible  Guy overcharged ... he knew I was from out of town  Absolute garbage ... very lucky that there are homeless people and we were able to give the food to them.   Stay away ..."}
{"text":"Nouilles Star?? More like No Star  Went for lunch. Food arrived in 3 minutes. Didnt have time to finish watered down soup. Whos noodles were just noodles.  Main dish was cold, cold rice,cold egg roll, cold chicken. Chicken was fatty and brown meat. And had no taste.  Dont waste your time and money. And possibly safety. Eat anywhere else!"}
{"text":"It's no longer called Soups and Noodles. It's now called Noodle Star. I used to come here  years ago and it was decent. I ordered the chicken pad thai tonight. I actually ended up throwing most of it out, something that my friends know me NEVER to do, I always eat everything on my plate. This was barely edible: very low quality chicken, gristly, it had small bones and crunchy ligaments. I'm never eating here again.  I agree with the review below, if I could give zero stars I would. Now I'm starting to wonder if that gristly meat was actually rat."}
{"text":"Three stars flat in the greatest of ambivalent neutralities:   This place is a cheap hole-in-the wall. You will find the homeless counting pocket change and the poorest of the poor eating here. You will sometimes see policemen getting take-out. The crowd is diverse and so is the menu.  Do not come here if you do not want your eyes tainted with the horrible kitsch oriental decor. Come here if you want cheap and large plates of food.  It won't make you ill: The kitchen looked clean, the bathrooms looked cleaned from my inspection. The staff does the minimum service needed while not keeping you waiting. They have always supplied chopstick requests in a timely manner.  Prepare to pay only in cash: No credit cards accepted.  I have only eaten from two excessively large dishes, shared with my wife: General Tao Tofu and the Vegetable Fried Rice. I was satisfied. Heck, I love this place."}
{"text":"Resto sublimissime. Il arrive souvent que les serveuses ne comprennent pas lorsqu'on leur demande des factures séparées, il y a des plats qui sont durs à terminer, la musique semble parfois souffrir de problemes techniques et les tables sont parfois collantes, mais pour le prix, on peut avoir un tres bon repas en le choisissant bien. De plus, les photos de jeunes femmes asiatiques sur les murs sont tres agreables a contempler en mangeant."}
{"text":"I Love their Soupes & Entré's but the fried chicken and beef can be very dry sometimes"}
{"text":"Aussi bien vous le dire tout de suite, ce restaurant n'offre pas de la gastronomie sans pour autant finir avec une gastro Lol  Avec un service ultra rapide votre serveur apportera votre assiette avec une nourriture correcte, mais pas aussi bonne que les bons resto du quartier chinois.   C'est ok car on se bourre la pense puis on continue notre petite vie tranquille !   Puisqu'ils doivent avoir une grande part de clientèle d'étudiants de l'université Concordia qui aime la rapidité et les prix abordables de ce restaurant.  Quand à moi j'y ai trouvé mon compte avec un sauté au poulet et crevettes assez bon.   first it's not a gastronomic restaurant with doesn'T mean you'll be sick after eating there !  With a lightning fast service the food are ok but not as good as the good restaurants in chinatown.  You fill your stomach then life goes on ! They must have lots of students of Concordia as customer cause of their fast service and affordable prices  I found my chicken and shrimp good."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quick, and just what you want to satisfy a Chinese food craving. For 60$ ,two of us ate like kings, with 4 dishes and 2 appetizers. We couldn't finish it and definitely ordered too much, but left satisfied and happy. The orange beef and peanut butter chicken are both excellent."}
{"text":"Location: Ste. Catherine Ouest, past the Faubourg.   Service: First, you almost always have to wait if you go during peak hours, but if you show up at some random time like say, 1:47pm, you can get a table. The service is OK but don't expect super friendly staff. They're very efficient mind you, but I suspect that being consistently busy and working in a confined space means that no chit chat will be included in the price. In any case, service is pretty quick so if you're in a hurry, you're all set.   Place: It's small and not much to look at. On one side you get takeout and on the other, you can sit in to eat. Posters of random Asian pop stars adorn the walls. I don't know any of them but I'm sure they're just great!  The food: I've been going there since like, 1995. Seriously. I love this place. The food is cheap, the portions are huge and I personally have never had a negative experience here. I always order the Cantonese wonton noodle soup - it's bloody huge and I can never eat it all, but on a cold winter's day it really hits the spot. The wontons are pork and shrimp..... YUM! The menu is quite large so there's bound to be at least one thing on the menu that will work for you.  Price: Cheap!"}
{"text":"Looking for comfort food. This one is mine. Usually, I would take out. Once an while, we will sit there. Don't expect the comfortable chairs and tables. Tap water taste bad, I end up with a soda. It seems all negative, but we turn the corner. Order your food, and it get to your table by super fast service. Each dish is so good that you would want to lick your plates... don't do it. . If you don't want sit, take it home, food still taste great. Prices are very very reasonable."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is always busy, but I think it's not for the right reasons. I went late last night because I left the library after 10 pm and had absolutely no groceries (also I've been craving a spicy bowl of noodles for 2 weeks straight).  I walked in and felt confident that this would satiate my craving, seeing a bunch of Middle Eastern, Desi, and African clientele. Surely, such a diverse group would promise spicy goodness? WRONG! I order the seafood hot pot which came with a bowl of steamed rice and the Malaysian Thai Basil Seafood noodles. Underwhelming and probably undercooked. They only accept cash and $30 for a pretty mediocre meal didn't put me in the best mood. I ate too much \"mystery meat\" and left with a tummy-ache that only subsided after lying on my stomach for a while. Avoid this place or try at your own risk."}
{"text":"I got the waitress's fav w a side wonton and it was very good and massive portions. Service was great, i charged my phone at my table, prices are decent and i enjoyed the vibe."}
{"text":"As someone else noted, if I could give this place a zero star rating I would!  Also somehow we should warn folks that this pace is now calling itself Star Noodles and to beware.  We've been here  in its previous incarnation and we had mixed reviews. We come for F1 and stay a week to experience all Montreal has to offer. The first year we tried this place we found it quaint yet I felt that something was not quite right with my chicken wing appetizer. ...  As if it wasn't quit good but not enough for sure to say it was bad.   The next year I swore to try it again and everything was ok and in fact pretty good. Now I'd like to state at this time (2011) it was very late and so super busy that we barely got in. We actually waited a reasonable time to get our meals and by that I mean 5mins or so.    This year we are late going in that it's the last day of he weekend festivities and we are super early for Montrealer's eating time (7ish).  Now the bad part....I will NEVER come back here again. My husband ordered the pork spring rolls as an appetizer and that dish is the best we have to write about but even that was delivered in less than 30 sec. Yup I'm not kidding.   Then a true test for me of any place ....the hot & sour soup.  Gross. I mean bad but I kept at it hoping I am wrong; you know when you keep thinking \"we'll maybe another spoonful\". I left it half empty and they didn't ask why.  The main dishes. My husbands Orange Beef came again in seriously 30 sec to 1 min absolutely tops. It is so heavily coated like a bad chicken ball from some dive and I wonder how did they do that in less than a min from appetizer end?????  You can figure that out.  Then the worse part - my main dish #79 garlic spicy beef and I'm looking forward to all that it says.  Oh my Lord gross gross.  It was so heavenly laden with salt and/orMSG that i could not eat it and I did try.  No one came to ask how any thing was and this even tho the place was not even half full. When they came to get the plates it was obvious that my plate was barely touched but still no questions. So I say \"that was terrible and so full of salt it was unbearable\". He smiled, left, and brought us the bill for the full amount.   I left $1 tip.  Not sure they got the message or if they whether they care; somehow I doubt it"}
{"text":"Je cherchais un lunch rapide près de mon travail, et je suis rentrée ici, attirée par le menu du dîner à 8$ plus taxes (comptant seulement). Bon, sérieux, ça ne vaut pas ben ben plus. Il y a une sélection d'une douzaine de plats, du général Tao au chow mein. Ça vient avec une soupe wonton et un rouleau impérial, ce qui est très cool! J'ai jeté mon dévolu sur le pad thaï aux crevettes, et mon dieu que j'ai été déçu. Il ne goûtait pas du tout le pad thaï; c'était plutôt une montagne de nouilles au sriracha, avec un peu d'uf sans goût et quelques petites crevettes surgelées. Vraiment insipide. La toilette était sale et la déco défraîchie. Je n'ose pas imaginer l'état de la cuisine! En plus, la serveuse ne pouvait pas me répondre en français."}
{"text":"Picture it, it's a cold windy Montreal night. My sister and I are looking for a place to eat, wandering aimlessly, freezing our butts off. The dumpling and hot pot places were full, out of the corner of my eye I spy a noodle sign.   Don't let the plastic curtains turn you off, it was a warm inviting hole in the wall, with THE BEST waiter, so funny and sweet, he made our night. The food was hot and came out extremely fast. Imperial rolls were a little over cooked, the soups were wonderful, entree of sauteed mushrooms, vegetables and noodle tasted great, but was quite oily.  The food was very inexpensive (CASH ONLY) and the portions are really big for the entrees, next time I'm in Montreal I will be back [said with and Arnold accent]."}
{"text":"Eh....just ordered special noodle soup to go...got back to my hotel and found soup and no noodles... I guess they think I need to go on a diet... no carbs for you tonight! :( Better check your order before you leave :)"}
{"text":"Been a regular here close to four years. Open late into the night. Great for grabbing a meal if pulling an all nighter."}
{"text":"I've been going to Star Noodle for several years now and it's a weird staple of this neighbourhood. The decor is pretty bland and a tad surreal with large commercial photographs of a model hanging in the dining room, but it's somehow charming in its own way. The portions are very generous and the prices are quite reasonable. The menu is pretty standard with most of what you'd expect from a late-night restaurant of its kind. Cash only.  I come here all the time after 12-14hr work days and the staff are always super friendly and remember my name. Overall, Star Noodle is a classic in my books and feels more like a set than a real restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd say it wasn't bad, so I wouldn't say \"don't go\", but I'm not a huge fan of this place, either.  Okay place, but nothing special.  I wouldn't travel to this place just to have lunch/dinner, if you live more than five blocks away.  But if you live closer, there's no harm trying this place out.   I had Tom Yum seafood noodle, and it was 11 something bucks before tax.  It filled me up very much, but I would like less food and cheaper price.  I mean, twelve bucks are pretty cheap, but compared to the atmosphere of the restaurant and the food itself, you can find somewhere cheaper and nicer.  I had way cheaper noodles in Montreal that were pretty nice."}
{"text":"Great place for some great yet affordable asian food. Service is good, too. Besides general tao and pad thai, the peanut butter dumplings are a must try!!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, I have to admit that I've been a regular at Nouilles Star for, what, almost ten years now? Like an ancient Chinese secret passed down from generation to generation, it was my ex who showed me this place first a decade ago, and I have since then passed on the torch and introduced some of my friends to it.   Before 2013, the restaurant used to be named Soupe et Nouilles but it was re-branded Nouilles Star, around the same time it started charging taxes and they redid their interior design, taking down posters on their walls that dated back to a pre-2000 era.  The place looks like nothing much, just another low-key Chinese restaurant. The service is ultra-fast and the food you order will unmistakably land in front of you in a delay of 5-10 minutes maximum. Sometimes less.   The waiters are generally not very expressive, so do not expect a five-star hotel service on that front; they are practical and quick however, and the food is very cheap, so it works in their favor.  Now, in regards to the food... I can vouch for the General Tao (Chicken or Tofu if you are vegetarian) and the fried rice section of their menu. They are, in my opinion, freaking delicious. My taste buds make a jig every time I eat there, and I leave feeling strangely fulfilled after every visit. Whatever else you order, it's at your own risk. You've been warned, Yelpers!  Nouilles Star is undeniably one of my favorite hidden gems in the city, but it's not for everyone. If you seek fancy food, stay the hell away. If you seek filling Chinese food that tastes good, go get yourself a General Tao. You're welcome.  P.S. This restaurant is cash-only. There is an ATM at the front door with a fee of $1.85 per transaction."}
{"text":"Hands down, the worst Chinese food that I have ever had in my life.  We ordered the peanut dumplings to start. They didn't taste awful but weren't a particularly difficult dish. It was mostly just dumpling dough smothered in peanut butter with no filling or other spices. About thirty seconds after the dumplings arrived, one of our main dishes was brought out. The other wasn't brought out for another five minutes. The Pad Thai was the dish they brought out first and the second it was placed on the table, my friend and I were both overwhelmed by the foul stench of the dish. It smelled like an animal shelter full of dead fish. It didn't look like any Pad Thai I'd ever had before. It seemed to be only noodles and chicken coated in a strange bright reddish orange sauce. Despite the smell, I decided I had to give it a taste. It tasted exactly the way it smelled. Foul. Like licking a cat's butthole. The other dish we ordered, sauteed veggies with noodles, it didn't look much better. It didn't have the same foul stench. It looked like they'd taken frozen vegetables and dropped them in a pan full of cooking oil. When we tasted the dish, this was confirmed. The vegetables were dripping in oil and tasted as if the oil was reused and they hadn't cleaned the pan in weeks. After sitting there for 15 minutes, with full plates in front of us, clearly not eating, our waiter came over and asked if we'd like the dishes to go. When we told him that the food was not what we had expected, he got incredibly defensive. He gestured to the other couple patrons in the restaurant, saying that they were eating the food and didn't have any problems. He then accused me of not knowing what Pad Thai was and using this as an excuse for why I didn't like his Pad Thai, which had, apparently, been a restaurant staple for 25 years. He passive aggressively dropped the bill on our table and didn't return. We were unaware that it was cash only and sat there for ten minutes, before finally waving down a waitress who told us that it was cash only. This same waitress, was clearing the table next to ours, and cleared away a full plate of the Pad Thai, which the waiter had earlier told us that everyone else in the restaurant was thoroughly enjoying.  My friend used the ATM to get out some cash and we were lucky that our bill came out to nearly twenty because no one ever returned to our table to see if we needed change. Twenty dollars for a few bites of a dish that smelled of rotting animal carcass. It was not worth it."}
{"text":"Je suis venu quelques fois avec mes amis,.  Je dois dire que leur service est vraiment désagréable. Durant la soirée lorsqu'il y a beaucoup de clients. Les serveurs se pressent pour servir les clients à la table. Une des serveuses a renversé de l'eau sur moi accidentellement. Par la suite, j'ai fait la commande pour mes amis 3 fois leur nouille cantonaise. Au moment de service, j'ai reçu 2 plats de riz cantonais. Je ne vois pas comment cela peut arriver.   Le riz a beaucoup de sel que je peux bien goûter des morceaux. Mon ami qui a reçu le nouille trouve que c'est trop de l'eau. Je comprends bien que à ce prix, les ingrédients sont déjà congelés en avance. Mais au moins j'espère qu'il peut évaporer de l'eau et qu'il fasse la cuisine.   Malgré après tout cela, il te demande de payer le tips."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for close to 15 years without incident and have always enjoyed the food preparations which are well above average. Their soups are more than satisfying and ever so delicious. I like that they are willing to put many Chinese vegetables on the menu, like Gai Lan, Dou Miao and Foo Gua which are hard to find in Chinese restaurants in the States located outside of a traditional Chinatown. The dumplings with peanut sauce is a unique dish quite different from other similar preparations I have had, that alone is reason enough to go and give this restaurant a try. I don't understand the star ratings sometimes, particularly when I have dined in a place for years and have been more than satisfied, it leaves me puzzled. I will let you be the judge when you find yourself in Montreal craving Asian food, I hope this place comes to mind, it does to me!"}
{"text":"I frequently go to this restaurant for a late night snack/meal as I live nearby, and they are open late on weekdays and weekends.   Overall, service is always very fast, and generally quite friendly - though not too personal- which is nice when you're expecting a fast, warm meal. Eating area is clean and tables are bussed quickly. There is a sit down side as well as a takeout side to the restaurant - which gets really busy in the evenings.   The menu is slightly overwhelming because it is too long and has too many options.  I tend to stick to what I like and not get too adventurous. They serve very typical western style Chinese food. My favourite on the menu is the Ma Po Tofu, and garlic broccoli.   Cash only, but ATM in the front."}
