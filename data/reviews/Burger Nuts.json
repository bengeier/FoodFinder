{"text":"Groupon:  my fiance will forever be indebted to you for leading us to Burger Nuts!

As a huge fan of burgers... and burger toppings... his eyes widened with delight at viewing the jumbo burger menu on the wall.  There even may have been some calculation of how many types of burgers could be made in this burger heaven.

Do yourself a favor and get crazy with the toppings!  Unlimited toppings for no extra charge!

We have been 3 or 4 times now, and each time the burgers were tasty, filling and gone quickly!  The sides are a bit greasy (no more than what you would expect) so I just tend to split it with my man.  

He also tried the shakes, and enjoyed them.  I wasn't a huge fan, but milkshakes aren't my favorite in general anyway.

We won't eat this kind of food too often, but when it's time for a day off the healthy regime, Burger Nuts will be on the list!"}
{"text":"Great burgers great fries they use peanut oil so even people with sat fat issues can eat their fries. Bottomline go eat here now."}
{"text":"Burger Nuts used to be top notch. Better than Five Guys hands down. Unfortunately  now its just hit and miss. Mistakes with orders increased while the portion size decreased. The people who run it seem nice and I hope they can turn it around.

I tried Burger Nuts a few times since my original review and I'm happy to say things were much improved. There were no mistakes and they were generous with the fries!"}
{"text":"Give em credit for trying. Since the eastside doesn't have five guys it's ur only option. Doesn't compare to Stevensons"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would! Called to order takeout tonight with a coupon from the all around town book I ordered from my daughters school, \"We invite you to enjoy one complimentary burger or sandwich when a second burger or sandwich of equal or greater value is purchased. Valid anytime. This is word for word what the coupon reads. We ordered 2 double cheese burgers. We were then told on the phone by a very rude employee, they only honor that coupon up to $5.00, which nowhere on the coupon does that say. My husband told the guy it says it nowhere and other coupons in the book make sure any exclusions are printed. We then speak to a manager who puts me rudely on hold twice, in the middle of some B.S. excuse that the coupon was printed before they expanded their menu and it was the old owners policy up to $5.00. Who owns it now stupid? Well not you for long that's for damn sure if that's how you conduct business! So we hung up and decided to order takeout from burgers and beer, same pricing but MUCH better quality then Burger Nuts subpar, dry burgers. (Had once before decided to give another shot with coupon) If you are smart you will take your business elsewhere as I will! Like I said Burgers and Beer is delicious!!!!! Burger Nuts is a JOKE!!"}
{"text":"*Disclaimer -- if you are on a diet of any kind, do not, I repeat DO NOT, visit Burger Nuts.  All of your progress will be shot to hell...it's too good to resist, and don't waste your time or money trying to be healthy.  Go big or go home.

I remember when Burger Nuts first opened in Willoughby.  Every time we would drive past the location, my fianc√© would crane his neck to see if it was open yet. Once it opened its doors, we became loyal patrons, and I've definitely come to love Burger Nuts.  The food is good, fast and cheap, and far tastier than anything a fast food chain has on its menu.  

You can load your burger with toppings for no extra charge.  It's made to order, so always juicy and delicious.  The fries are also made fresh, but listen to Juan S. - it's a nightmare for those with peanut allergies.  There are also peanuts on the tables to munch on while you wait for your order.  It's almost like being at a baseball game, without the let down of the Indians and the price of stadium food.

The dining room is cozy, and there's always been ample seating when I've visited.  It's decorated with local paraphernalia from Willoughby South High School, the Lake County Captains and the like, reminding customers that it supports and loves being a part of the community.  Next time you're jonesing for burger in the Willoughby/Wickliffe/Eastlake area, be sure to check out Burger Nuts instead of the standard issue drive thru window.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good Burgers!! Good service!! Large selection of free toppings. The staff might tell youwhat would be good to put on your burger. It would be your own fault if you get tooo carried away with the toppings. Some compare it to that other place (Five Guys) But to me and many others that I've asked say no. Freshly made REAL potato fries oh goodne
ss. This is the spot!!!! Try a few peanuts while you wait."}
{"text":"I hate giving places 1 star, but this place deserves it.  Like others I purchased the Groupon online and thought I would give it a shot.  Upon entering was total mayhem.  The first thing I noticed was the overflowed trash can dropping french fries all over the floor.  The places screams \"Ghetto 5 Guys\".  Could this have been a potential 5 Guys franchise that never happened?.  Everything was a knock off from the menu to the red tiles on the walls.  The menu was basically a banner hung up with no proper order.  The decorations are random sports items tacked to the wall.  When i say tacked, I mean the old school thumbtacks.  It looked like a 11 year olds bedroom.    

After ordering a burger I just stood there and watched the show.  The staff was sloppy and all over the place.  How hard is it to give your employees matching shirts to help clean the place up?  The cook on the grill wore warmup pants half way down with his boxers sticking out.  Come on!  He also had zero training of how to properly cook a burger.  He just kept flipping it over until it was burnt.  No flavoring at all.  

Don't expect to wash your burger down with a nice Coca Cola or Pepsi product.  Their fountain is filled with all generic products.  And those hand dipped milkshakes they rave about?  Another disappointment.  They have a blender on the counter mixing in bottled flavors.  Sad

The thing that made me the most upset was the overall cleanliness.  The staff was nowhere to be found.  Originally we planned to eat in the restaurant, but since every empty table was dirty we were forced to eat in the car.  It took us 18 minutes to get our burger and not once did an employee come out to wipe a table down.  A sanitary nightmare.  Other patrons were just as upset about the quality of the place as us.
Don't do it, if you want it done right go to another burger place in the area.  Wasn't even worth the 6 dollar Groupon."}
{"text":"I like coming here lots of options and free toppings :) fries are good too it's does have. A 5 guys kinda feel to it"}
{"text":"We have been back several times since I last wrote a review, and I have to say that they have stepped up their cleanliness. The staff are out in the dining area cleaning as soon as someone leaves. I would have given more stars if it wasn't for the fact that the past 2 times I was there I was served a pink turkey burger. The first was just slightly pink and I wasn't sure if it was the meat or the ketchup. Today I had gotten about half way through when I realized that the middle was really pink.  I showed it to the guys behind the grill, and they apologized and gave us a buy one get one free coupon. There were some others in the dining room heard what was going on and checked there's as they had gotten turkey as well. It appeared mine was the only pink one. If we go back, I will stay away from the turkey."}
{"text":"After a fairly recent take-out experience that left two people fighting for the bathroom, I have to go ahead and say don't go here. Unsanitary....obviously."}
{"text":"Disgustingly dirty, terrible service, disgusting staff, untruthful - they charge you for organic but give you Angus...they gave me an Angus Burger when I ordered organic, I told them about the error as I was rereading my receipt. They said they would correct it, but miraculously my order was ready literally 10 seconds later. Most places in the universe don't take 10 seconds to cook a fresh Burger. Have been there 3 times. Will never patronize again...Go to Five Guys, Chik Fila, anywhere else, instead."}
{"text":"Just like 5 Guys.  Check the internet for coupons, it will help out."}
{"text":"When you're craving a burger...BURGER NUTS is the only place to go!  You customize your burger...which type of bun, meat, even how many patties!  And ALL THE TOPPINGS are FREE!  Lots and Lots of choices...and I can never decide between the cajun fries or the sweet potato fries...get one of each!  Free roasted peanuts while your burger is cooking too!  Always a friendly face to talk to behind the counter which makes you feel like family.  Just talking about it here makes me want to go!  See you there!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times.  I'm not a huge burger person, but a good burger every once and a while, is nice.   I've never had bad food here.  The staff is sometimes a little iffy and the tables aren't always cleaned in between customers, but I do enjoy this place more than Five Guys (and I like Five Guys).  I like Burger Nuts, because there are more burger options than just beef.  You can order Angus, Kobe, Chorizo, Turkey (my fave here), Bison, Vegetarian, Organic and a few other choices.  The bread and toppings are always fresh.  There are numerous choices for cheese, veggies, etc. The french fries are hand cut and cooked to order.  I think that this place is under new ownership.  The fries tasted a bit different on this visit, still tasty, but different.  The previous version seemed as though there was some rosemary and sea salt sprinkled on top, before serving.  The portions of protein and starch are sufficient.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Gave Burger Nuts a try while I was in the area after checking out the other Yelp reviews.  It's a small place with a decor (and free peanuts) very similar to a Five Guys.  I was pretty impressed by the selection of burgers and sausages available: Angus Beef, Kobe, Bison, Bratwurst, Chorizo, Turkey, and Veggie.  On top of that, they offered three types of buns--egg, multi-grain, and pretzel--and free toppings too numerous to list (though there are some interesting highlights like stadium mustard, peanut butter, pesto mayo, ham, salami, and pepperoni).

I went with a double Kobe burger on a pretzel bun with a side of onion rings.  I definitely wasn't blown away by the burger, but it was okay.  I expected the burger to be a little more juicy than it was, and I wish the 1/4 lb. patties were a little thicker rather than flattened out (kind of like the flat Wendy's patties).  The onion rings were decent--the serving is big enough for two to share.

Comparisons to Five Guys are inevitable.  Burger Nuts definitely has a better selection of burgers, buns, and condiments compared to Five Guys, but I would have to give Five Guys the nod in terms of producing a quality burger."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints! Gotta try it out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger.  They always have good coupons and have no problem taking them!  Many different toppings.  Staff is always nice and quick.  Decor on the walls is a bit tacky but i would eat there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The kids working behind the counter were dirty, sloppy, and unfriendly. The place was dirty and table tips were covered in empty peanut shells. I witnessed customers who politely brought back their order, which was wrong, and the girl behind the counter was ticked off and rude that they would expect her to fix the mistake she made! There was a girl who didn't work there sitting in the back on a lawn chair reading who was yelling at the guy who worked there. The fries tasted awful like the oil hasn't been changed in months. The burger was soggy and not anything to be excited or expect. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I been there once. The price is ok. If cholesterol is not an issue, this is a place to go. The burger is nice and juicy. Peanut allergies beware. All the french fries are fried in peanut oil. They are good greasy fries if you like those kind of fries like in Brennan's Restaurant. Atmosphere is very nice for a fast food place. 

Great place to eat."}
{"text":"We were not as impressed as others were. Maybe just an off night.  Our Kobe burgers were too well done and therefore a bit dry.  Somewhat pricey for fast-food but the topping options are awesome.

Will probably try again just to give them another chance but won't wake up in the middle  of the night craving a Burger Nut!"}
{"text":"Wow, things really have changed, and not for the better :-(.  This place isn't as clean as it use to be, and the staff has become rude.  My burger was still good, but it just wasn't the same."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Better than Five Guys, hands down.

After raving about how delicious Five Guys was, my friend recommended that I try Burger Nuts in Willoughby. Burger what? And where?

Off I drove to Willoughby, in search of a heart warming fast food burger. After passing the location a couple of times (there's a lot of signs on the road at night...for some reason I couldn't find it too easily), I finally made it in.

Walking into Burger Nuts looked like a replica of Five Guys. Free peanuts and even the menu was similar (although it looked like Burger Nuts had better desserts). I ordered the #1 and sat down.

Man, was that burger a great burger. Unlike Five Guys, the burger patties were PLUMP. There was two plump patties (making it 1/2 a lb?), with bacon, spicy jack, and all the condiments as well as their special Burger Nut sauce. And the BUN of that burger. It was so nicely toasted and reminded me of Chinese buns bread- not the normal smashed down buns of fast food restaurants of today.

And on top of that, there are choices for FRIES. Chili fries, cajun fries, the list goes on. I definitely got the sweet potato fries. Mmmmmm.

I didn't finish my burger. I was stuffed. At Five Guys, I devoured the whole thing. But at Burger Nuts, the burger was just too plump and juicy for me to finish it. MMMMM.

If you're looking for a solid fast food burger, definitely go to Burger Nuts over Five Guys. Any day."}
{"text":"I've bought two Groupons to Burger Nuts in the last month or so and, aside from stashing my money under my mattress, this is one of the wisest investment decisions I've ever made.

The burgers are cooked fresh to order, and ALL of the toppings are free, even the premium ones like bacon and guacamole. It's pretty cheap too, and a triple angus burger (3/4 lb.) will run you $6.49 with all the fixins' included. They also have kobe, bison, chorizo, veggie, and turkey burgers, and I can't wait to try the first three (veggie and turkey burgers are scarcely burgers at all, if you ask this connoisseur).

So the toppings are great and plentiful, the bun I had, the egg bun, was the perfect combination of doughy goodness and fresh-from-the-toaster crispiness, and the meat is top-notch. It's so hot and juicy when you pick it up from the counter, and you can tell it's top of the line Angus. Really, really good stuff.

At this point, I'd have to say Burger Nuts is #2 in my Cleveland Burger Power Rankings, right behind Moxie and slightly ahead of Brown Bag Burger. And of course it's #1 in my Reasons to Drive to Mentor power rankings, right ahead of...nothing."}
{"text":"This local-local burger place is like Five Guys on 'roids! 
There are several options for buns, cheese, meats, and fried sides, and wait for it.....toppings galore! So much to choose from and so little tummy space.

It's difficult for me not to love this place. When I'm having a fat day, I go all out...turkey pepperjack on multi-grain with guac,  a crispy side of onion straws with po'boy sauce. 

If you enjoy Five Guys, you'll appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Burger dry, toppings skimpy and not too tasty. Egg bun was burnt on inside. Fries limp and greasy, with lots of overcooked bits. Vanilla shake was good, though not a generous portion. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"To update my update. The special on Mondays and Tuesdays is $5.55 for the junior burger which still beats the pants off any fast food place around in terms of both size and taste, a drink and fries.  Awesome deal, recession and heart buster no doubt."}
{"text":"I would have to agree...that it is waaaay better than 5 Guys.  And it is locally  and family owned and operated.
They make they're own bread, and now have a bunch of choices in buns.  Even a pretzel roll. Yum!
They have a great list of toppings, and they don't skimp.   
And the burgers themselves, are handmade....you can tell the difference.  
And yes...they have the peanuts....."}
