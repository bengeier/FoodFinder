{"text":"Food is good, but, listening to the employees argue with each other, dropping the f bomb at least once, while I'm eating breakfast is not my idea of a good breakfast."}
{"text":"If you want some nice greasy chicken this is not the place for you. I got a Cajun filet club and my mom got 3 supremes. It was the driest chicken we have ever eaten. After every bite we had to chase it with tea just to keep us from choking. The chicken tasted like it was from three days ago. Definitely not a fresh piece of fried chicken. The fries were horrible. They had so much seasoning on them it wasn't even funny. The tea is never good, you can order sweet tea and it taste like unsweetened tea. It was horrible Bojangle's honestly."}
{"text":"Best Bojangle's in Gaston County. Food is always fresh, hot and delicious. Restaurant is clean and window service is a tightly run ship. Very friendly staff. I recently went through the window and was greeted \"Hey girl friend\" and it made me smile."}
