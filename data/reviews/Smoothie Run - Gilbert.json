{"text":"I love this place. Don't let it be confused with the smoothie place that was here before...new menu, great staff( Andreya has been particularly helpful with my food allergies), and Uber convenient. Their menu is surprisingly diverse and their boba smoothies are AH-MAZING. I highly suggest you try this place! If they put gluten free bread for sandwiches (in all fairness they already have gluten free pizza crust) on the menu it'll be 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I went on lunch break and ordered a veggie sandwich which was to come w/ lettuce, tomato, avocado, onion and cheese.  After a 10 min. wait my sandwich finally came up and I left.  But when I bit into it I found it only contained a sprinkle of lettuce and slice of cheese- no tomato, avocado or onion.  I returned to complain at which point was told they were out of all other ingredients.  First, why are so many ingredients out, secondly, why wasn't I told this as they discovered it so I could change my order, third, why did it take 10 minutes to throw some garden salad on a loaf of bread (no one was in front of me in line).  Upset, I returned the lettuce bread & ordered a veggie pizza instead and paid the difference.  Another 10 minutes went by before I went up to check on status, at which point I was told that they can't make the pizza bc they are out of regular crust (only had gluten free) and out of mozzarella cheese!!!!  Again why aren't there any ingredients stocked and WHY did it take ANOTHER 10 minutes to let me know this?!?!  I was standing there, clearly waiting the entire time!  At the end of it all I requested a refund but my 30 min break was over and I still had no lunch.  Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced!! And there was only 1 girl working who had wasn't very friendly. She left the front unattended for 15 minutes and two customers came and left because no one was there to greet them. If I didn't already pay I would have left by now too. 30 minutes gone by and still waiting for 2 smoothies and a kids pizza. When her food finally did come, my four-year-old was so excited because she had waited for so long but she ran to the counter and slipped and hit her head on the corner of the counter and started screaming. The girl that works there was nowhere to be found and I had to stop and ask her to get ice because my daughters head was already swelling and bruising. When I finally calmed her down and opened her pizza box for her to eat, the pizza wasn't even cut into pieces it was just a whole pizza. Thankfully I convince my daughter to go home even though she wanted to eat at the restaurant, so I could at least cut her pizza so she could eat it. I will never ever return to this establishment, and if you are in a hurry of some sort I would suggest the same thing."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Salads are freshly made and fresh. The #7 smoothie was delicious! Had the veggie sub and the bread was fresh. So coming back!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood next door so was excited for this place to open. This is located on corner of Higley and Ray next to Dunkin Donuts and Zoyo. I was happy to see they are open until 10 on a Sunday. I popped in for a Smoothie. Staff was average but not overly friendly or welcoming.  I ordered the Large  Pineapple, Orange, Banana for $6.50, good size.   After I swiped my card I then noticed the sign that says they charge 35 cents for credit cards. Are you kidding me? This small stuff really annoys me. It's not a  cheap Smoothie and you want to charge me extra to use my credit card?? Pretty sure most people use a card now days and 99.9% of places it's free to swipe. I just feel like business owners need to either build this into the total cost or don't charge it period. The cashier definitely didn't tell me verbally ahead of time, especially since they just opened and its not a normal thing I should check for or ask.  She handed me my drink and I had to ask where to get a straw... Again, it's new. How do I know.  I glanced at the food menu before I left, yep way Overpriced!!!  My smoothie is good but not the best I've had. Looks like I'll drive 2 miles down to Jamba Juice where the smoothies are better and they don't charge me extra to use my credit card.   Sorry Smoothie Run, I tried.  I give lots of 5 star reviews and you failed me. I'll be surprised if you stay in business. Step up your service, better prices and get rid of that stupid 35 cents petty fee and you might thrive. We have lots of choices in Gilbert so you have to be better than this."}
{"text":"Food is meh- but the smoothies are actually really delicious and better than any other place I've tried. Took off a star for pricing though because the smoothies are pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Walked in and there wasn't an employee manning the counter. Waited about 15 minutes, and was about to walk out when a employee finally walked in from outside. Smoothie were not that great. They were a lot more sweet than they should be. Which makes me think they use canned fruit, or a flavoring from a bottle. We also ordered a Jerk Chicken Sandwich and a Kids Pizza. Pizza was obviously a frozen pizza heated up. Sandwich had stale bread, and the chicken was over seasoned to the max. To top it all off, it was all way too overpriced."}
{"text":"We just happened to be on that side of town when we craved something delicious and mouth watering. We decided to try out what it seems like a local smoothie/sandwich/boba shop which is attached to frozen yogurt. Not sure if it's the same owners? Anyway, basically a one stop shop if you have kids.. or just 2 thirty year olds.  I got the medium(smallest size) #2-Strawberry, mango and pinapple! First sip definitely packs a punch but then has this tart but sweet flavor throughout the smoothie.  I feel they might have a little too much on the menu- I get it- wanting to try to cater to everyone but if a whole soccer team comes in and there's only 1 person working, you're gonna have some upset soccer moms.  One star knocked off for not enough seating. I would definitely come back though. Better than Jamba and you get more bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I went into smoothie run for the first time yesterday, took one sip of the smoothie I got and was not happy with my choice. They gave me a coupon for buy one get one so today I decided to give them another shot. I just Got there at 11:05, they open at 11:00 and someone was in there. After knocking on the locked door 5 times and not getting let i got in my car. Then I saw her go unlock the door so I went back up thinking I have a coupon may as well. The smoothies I got today are awful, no flavor. I had a buy one get one coupon and was charged 12$ but the smoothies are originally 8$? She didn't apply my Snap Fitness 10% off, AND it's double loyalty points on Tuesday's and I've bought 4 smoothies from this place now and somehow have 2/8 stars. To top it off the employee took a phone call while I was ordering. The whole concept of the place is not great...a place that has healthy options like smoothies and salads should not have pizza, etc. NEVER RETURNING. This place should go out of business ASAP and be replaced with something else."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sub from here and it was kind of gross and it just seem like they microwave something frozen. It seems as if their menu is way too large and it's just complicated and hard for me to choose. Also it's not their fault but the location is just a crappy one for parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had late nights at work and wanted to try a healthy food place to go. We called multiple times and no answer... we finally got a hold of them and ordered our food after 10 minutes of calling. I called again on my lunch break one day and no answer twice.. I arrived assuming they would be busy they were empty and the employees were sitting outside talking with each other. You would expect a new food place to be on their A game especially with the growth in this area. -From a neighbor in the area most likely not to return or recommend."}
{"text":"service was bad, low quality food and it came out cold. long wait time and overpriced. Not really worth it. Wouldn't recommend this place and will never come back."}
{"text":"Horrible! The employees were cursing and nasty towards customers. When a customer did not pick up their smoothie right away, the worker furiously screamed the order number before taking the smoothie down. No one knew what was going on and were yelling at each other in the back kitchen.   In addition to this, the cashier did not know how to make change. For a small smoothie, it costs $8.09 (sooo expensive!) and I paid with a ten dollar bill and a dime. I told the cashier I didn't want much change back so I gave her ¢10, expecting to get a penny in return. Instead, the worker was frustrated and told me to take back my dime because it would not make a difference?! She claimed I would only get .81 back instead of .91. In other words, the cashier had NO clue how to add, and I just gave up and accepted the .91 in unnecessary coins. There is also a charge if you use a card to pay.   Unwelcoming atmosphere, awful customer service, extremely overpriced menu items, and mediocre taste... will not go back- don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"Tried today for the first time since they opened!!! And.... loved it! The lemon, strawberry and kiwi is delish! The large size is huge, so I will go smaller next time."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. All they got are overpriced food. Bought a smoothie with tapioca and you can't even get the Tapioca because it's all sticking together and old. Not worth it. I got picture to prove it."}
{"text":"First of all, we parked next to an old, white \"kidnapper's van.\" Turns out, it's their delivery van. Second, we waited about 20 minutes to place our order because no one was at the cash register. We were about to leave when a girl wearing a Dunkin' Donuts shirt showed up. She took forever to make our order. My kids' pizzas were frozen and the girl burned the pizzas in the microwave! My husband's chicken sandwich was awful and to top it all off, they use fruit purée (not fresh fruit) in their   smoothies. They were super sweet and so unhealthy! Yuck! Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food, paid and waited for over 30 minutes to get 2 pitas made. The first one was the Gyro and made wrong. The second one was the Buffalo chicken one and after sitting he told me that they didn't have any Gorgonzola cheese.   The family behind us ordered and he told them the same thing about 15 minutes after they ordered 2 smoothies.   Just seems like a unorganized mess here and not very structured."}
{"text":"I brought my three grandsons here today. I was actually here for five days ago.  We had pizza and chicken wings and the smoothies were much better than I expected."}
{"text":"Looks like this place is also owned by Zoyo Yogurt which is next door.  I saw Zoyo workers flying between the two spaces.    My family wanted smoothies but higher quality than McDonalds.  My wife and daughter seemed to think these smoothies were better...I wasn't convinced.  Obviously they use fresh fruits and probably a fancy blender, but I really didn't taste much of a difference.  It took about 10 minutes for the two smoothies I ordered to be ready.  The employee behind the counter was very busy counting money and looking at a check book and could care less.  Not sure if they are going for a island vibe where time doesn't matter.    I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Worst smoothie ever. I ordered a small strawberry smoothie for my son and it tasted like Caprisun powder mixed with ice crush. There was no real fruit in that drink I can guarantee. It was $5.97 almost $6 for that. So hilarious. Never come back."}
{"text":"So, I actually meant to go to Swig N' Sweets on S Market St but couldn't remember what it was called so I just typed \"smoothies\" into my GPS and ended up here, lol. I came a little bit before closing and ordered a large pineapple, banana, and coconut cream smoothie. If I could go back I would have subbed mango for banana because I think the banana pushed it over the edge of being too sweet but I came home and drank the whole thing so it obviously wasn't that much of a problem. For $6.50 they do give you a huge smoothie so I didn't have any complaints about the price. The man who served me was really friendly and personable which I always appreciate especially that close to closing time. I'm glad I stumbled upon this place and do plan on visiting again soon."}
{"text":"My first experience here was pretty good. The menu is very large with a variety of not only smoothie flavors but also tea, boba, and blended lattes. I personally attempted to order the caramel frozen latte but they unfortunately did not have the ingredients for the drink so they substituted it for a smoothie. Considering the fact the smoothies are a solid $3 more than the lattes I was okay with the substitute. I picked the #2 smoothie which has strawberry, mango and pineapple and it was the BOMB! I am usually not a fan of smoothies but the #2 was the perfect combo of sweet, tartness and creaminess. I also ordered a pepperoni pizza which was very fresh, it had a very thin crust and a nice crunch. I will be returning."}
{"text":"My family & I finally check this place out during lunch time today. We met Marcus he took care of us. He made our orders he's so kind! We order 5 hot wings first, a Thai tea boba, watermelon boba, & caesar salad. I order the #6 I believe it's the raspberry, blueberries & strawberries. I added whey protein & peanut butter! IT IS DELICIOUS! My son really likes his thai tea too! Everyone enjoy the wings that we had to order more 15 of them! We'll be back again and I didn't get extra charge using my debt card at all."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! She said we are out of bananas, pineapple and oranges. Next she said we use fruit purée. I said please let me see the bottle she showed it to me and it's the same horrible crap that is used in bars with the 1st ingredient being high fructose corn syrup! I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a healthy smoothie!!"}
