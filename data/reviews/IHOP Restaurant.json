{"text":"I've eaten at IHOP's when I've been in the US & always look forward to it, good selection, prices & you're in & out.  Went to this one last summer for lunch and ordered a salad, it was a meal in itself! Very good salad, I quite enjoyed it & their menu salad selection. They weren't busy yet we had to wait 10 minutes to get in, odd. They should build another one in north Calgary."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for some time since it was announced. I have been to other IHOPs in the US, and this is as every bit as good!  Same big menus, lots of choices, and all are delicious. My lunch partner had a Bacon & Egg Cheeseburger that was monstrous for a lunch portion. I enjoyed a Chicken Supreme Stacker with the oozing sauce and gooey cheese - messy but very good.  There was a line up of at least 12 deep by 11:30am, restaurant was packed, but the wait was maybe 5 minutes. Management and servers are already operating like a well-oiled machine.  Bottomless drinks barely got emptied and were full up again, food came out very fast, hot, and so fresh. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"So maybe I'm just in a bad mood today but I found something kind of ridiculous. I ordered a bacon omelet but asked for some of the chilli lime sauce that they put on the chorizo omelet on it. Seriously what is it 2 table spoons of some sauce. That's an extra $1.99? The whole pot of sauce they made probably only cost them $1.99 I understand businesses need to be profitable but come on that's a little much."}
{"text":"The food was average for a restaurant of this caliber. Exactly what I expected...except for one thing. Our waitress Jas was exceptional. Even though the restaurant was busy she treated all of us like we were her only customer. This kind of service is rare today and she should be rewarded in some way besides our tip. Great job and I can't rave enough about how awesome you were."}
{"text":"We went here because it was IHOP- Omigod IHOP, we drove from downtown. Will not be back, the breakfast was even worse than Denny's (and I hate dennys). It seems contrived, like it's not real food, if that makes sense, and nothing is tasty it's all just .. there. And to top it all off you get about half the portion of \"fake food\" that you would at Denny's. Most unsatisfying weekend breaky I have ever had, I had the usual 2 eggs, bacon & toast my bf had the waffles (so small!) and agrees.  Rickys is the way to go for a big, cheap and consistent weekend breaky. I really don't see how this place can last once the hype runs out."}
{"text":"Service is good But there breakfast I've tried that comes with sausages and bacon is terrible .  Bacon is so thin and no taste and the sausages are horrible .   For a bacon and egg breakfast don't come here . You will be disappointed"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, but the service is terrible here. Painfully slow. Every Time I come here its the same. Plus not many options for vegans or vegetarians."}
{"text":"I feel like because Ihop is new to our City their biggest concern is turnover. This being said customer service, and food quality get's a back seat.  I have been to a few different IHOP's in my time and this one was the only place I felt this way.  There are a lot of people on the floor and they all seem too busy but at the same time no one is really doing anything. We were in contact with 6/7 different people from the time we walked in and we were never really sure who our server was.   The food that came to our table was nothing special. The 4 different types of syrups were fun but that was about it. and it was funny how perfectly square everything was. It looked like it just walked out of a factory and not a kitchen.   One of the biggest thing that bugged me was that they do not bus tables as the meal goes on, instead they wait until the party has left the table to do a quick bus and re set. We had a table of 6, 3 adults & 3 kids - that is a lot of cutlery, plates and mess that is accumulated during a meal. Not to mention it looks very messy.   It's quite a machine they are running, when done effectively it can be useful but they have no sense of how it should be run. Breakfast at Denny's or even McDonalds is better suited. Which is a let down as people in the South were psyched to have a nice breakfast place.   If they want people to come back they need to bump up the service factor & food quality or there will be no one walking through the door once the hype dies down."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, location is convenient. Best Pancakes in Calgary. Good for all age groups."}
{"text":"I feel the need to write this review because the woman who served our 22-person group all by herself was just amazing. I have been here many other times with less satisfactory results but their waitress is seriously worth 5 stars.  We walked in (2 groups from our high school government before a morning meeting) to have breakfast as a bonding experience, at around 6:45 am. The lady there told us things would be a bit slow since she was the only one there, excluding the chef. We apologized, and she said nonsense, she was happy to have us all there.  All of us were amazed by her work ethic, kindness, and just general lovely demeanor. Any other person could have groaned at having all this high school kids in at once so early but she was funny and very nice. I cannot even explain how awesome this woman was.  The food didn't even take that long, was pretty good, and by the end when we were leaving she thanked US for being such a great group. We couldn't believe it and we all told her that she was pretty much the best waitress ever, which she totally was. I would seriously recommend going early on a Wednesday morning just to have such an wonderful waitress!"}
{"text":"Ihop you let me down.  This was our 4th visit since they opened, the other 3 visits we had to wait a half hour + but the service was good and the food was excellent.  We went on Friday night with the boys around 7 PM.  Didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes.  Got our table, waited for a waiter, waitress came by after she finished apologizing to the table next to us (not a good sign).  We ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  Then we waited and we waited.  We got the soup for me and the salad for my son, we both ordered the Tilapia dinner.  We waited and waited.  The manager was passing by, I asked him to check on our food as we had been waiting for quite a while.  About 5 minutes later my husband and son got their pancakes and eggs, and we got our tilapia.  The 2 tilapia meals were luke warm, like they were sitting for quite a while.  The manager came by and I told him that the fish and whole meal was only luke warm.  He looked quite shocked by this and said he would make us new fish.  We said ok.  He came back with little plates with the fish, I put it on my plate and cut it, it was raw.  Eew!  I went over to him and told him this, again he was shocked.  To his credit, he took the blame and offered to cover our dinner.  We only saw our waitress once, she didn't come by at all and when we did see her, it seemed to us that she had tables too spread out, a different waiter brought the bill, I told him to talk to the manager as we weren't paying tonight.  Will go back, because we like ihop, and hope for the best next time."}
{"text":"I have been to IHOP in the United States and I know what to expect. You don't go for the decor or ambiance. Heck, even the service can leave a lot to be desired at times. But they make darn good pancakes, which is why I was quite excited when I learned that not only an IHOP was open in Calgary, it was open in my neck of the woods!  I came here the first time with my mother for our traditional brunch meetup. There was a wait, but it went by pretty quickly. We were seated and our waitress came by almost immediately to take our drink orders. That was a good start. But slowly the service began to drop off, and we didn't see our waitress as much over the course of our visit. If the food was good, I could possibly let the downhill service slide. But it was subpar at best. I got the blueberry pancakes with whip cream on top and they were just ok. I love pancakes and though I try to eat healthy, I can never say no to a good short stack. But these had barely any blueberries, were undercooked in some parts and the whip cream on top had melted by the time it arrived at the table. My mother's pancakes weren't much better. My mother told me she had no interest in returning, and at the time I agreed with her.  A while later though, my friends convinced me to give it a second chance. Hey, when I went last time they had only been open a month, so they had to have some improvement right? Well I can sadly report that things were even worse than last time. Our waitress this time kept disappearing for long periods of time and would come back reeking of cigarettes. I don't care if someone smokes, but when it's all I can smell when you are at our table, it's not pleasant. This time, I tried the chocolate pancakes with eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The eggs, bacon and hashbrowns were fine. The chocolate pancakes, for being described by the waitress as 'so amazing and really chocolatey' were a letdown. They just tasted like flour, and the chocolate was not pronounced in them at all.   Overall, I gave this IHOP two chances. I may give a third chance for the sake of 'three strikes, you're out', but certainly not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Terrible service and terrible food. The manager was really rude and wasn't willing to compromise. I am a vegetarian and found a piece of bacon in my meal hidden under my hashbrowns, I told the manager and she said \"well you ate most of it\". What kind of service is this??? Do NOT go here. Go to Denny's instead. This is a horrible representation of the ihop name."}
{"text":"Garbage. Bland. Great senior citizens type food. Everything about from service to food. Just pure slop. Get a better breakfast for free from the church people downtown who feed the down and our. I actually tried a dinner they were handing out out of curiosity and it was better. I had the Philly steak. Just cheese and a pass off as \"steak \"  no peppers or onions , no attempt to even dump sauce out a hienz bottle. Nothing. I asked if that was missing anything. They said no. I paid and left."}
{"text":"Very consistent breakfest joint. The staff is attendative and is willing to make special request within reason happen. The food is consistent and flavourful. One of the best part of this place is the pancakes and all the different types you can get, red velvet pancake is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast...as all IHOP's always deliver!!   Even with new staff and crazy busy crowds, everyone was very friendly and very helpful.   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant and what a disappointment it was. Food was gross, my kids food sat under the heat lamps so long that the plates were scorching hot! I ordered a chicken/sun dried tomato sandwich and there was so much grease that the bun was dropping and stoked. When we asked to see the manager out server said she isn't surprised."}
{"text":"ordered something off their dinner selections and wasnt very pleased. the food was average and honestly was a bit overpriced. mashed potatoes were dry. service was average. next time I will try getting breakfast and hopefully thats better."}
{"text":"While still a good, solid breakfast, the customer experience here is one of the worst I've ever seen for an experienced, chain restaurant. Waiting to be seated while two employees discuss their work schedule without acknowledging me, a server who says she can \"take my order immediately\" then walks away to deliver three bills and take two other orders and watching a host push four couples to a cramped deuce (two person table) against the wall only to be asked by ALL to be moved to a booth, of which there are nearly 10 open. It really ruins an otherwise average meal experience. I sure hope the management upgrades their training and/or their staff to meet a basic dining experience."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place. The food isn't bad and the prices are reasonable. The interior isn't anything crazy but it's IHOP at the end of the day. The sandwich I had was ok but the crepes were something else. We had ice cream instead of whip cream, strawberries and vanilla sauce on them and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences that I have came across. Walked in and got seated, then was left alone for at least 15 min. Finally when we ordered our waitress came with 2 glasses of water as well, my cup had hardened lipstick stains all around the glass, and when I mentioned it, the waitress rolled her eyes right in front of me. I never got my second glass of water... I had ordered strawberry crepes, and the fruit was completely cold and still had frost on them, so they were definitely poured straight from the freezer bag. Sister ordered bacon and eggs, and the bacon was close to being raw, it was so chewy and undercooked, eggs were supposed to be basted soft, but ended up being basted hard. We also ordered a side of stuffed french toast, which never arrived with our meal, so when we asked for it it came to our table in about 2 minutes, which was super fast... want to know why? it was freezing cold, like they took it out of the fridge and gave it to us. Lastly we ordered a side of cinnastacks pancakes, the pancakes were bigger than the plate that they arrived on, and our waitresses finger was digging into the pancakes! they were dripping, so she placed a napkin underneath.. it was a soggy disaster. i could only eat one bite because it was complete mush. gross.  When we were heading up to the front to pay, we realized that the manager was collecting money, and when he asked us how our experience was we told him our complaints, and all he said was \"oh\" and then charged us for the full amount of our bill.  We barely ate any food on our plates, and left hungry.   Definitely not going here again."}
{"text":"A great place for dine in breakfast with great menu selections. The food are well portioned, but the sausage and bacon can be salty for some. The service were great on my visits (non-peak hours) as I tend to avoid peak hours. If you plan to have breakfast over the weekend, expect to wait to get seated. Overall, I would go back for breakfast crave."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night for dinner. Instead of trying to fight rush hour traffic, I detoured and went to the IHOP in Shawnessy. If you have trouble finding it, it's located just west of the A&W. We were greeted by a hostess at the front, and were asked if we wanted a table or booth. The restaurant itself is bigger on the inside, than what the exterior looks like. It's both clean and new, and that's the bonus of eating somewhere that's just opened. We ordered everything from burger's to breakfast, and everything tasted just fine. I had breakfast, which consisted of two eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast. You can choose what type of toast, how you want your eggs, and sausage, bacon, or ham. This was just $7.99. My wife had crepes with yogurt and fruit, and for an extra $1.50 or so you can get eggs and ham with your order. Also we ordered strawberry waffles, which were good and my older boy ordered a burger. The burger he said was good, which I take with a grain of salt because every new burger he tries he says tastes good. It was accompanied by large deep fried onion rings, which were tasty, but greasy. The waitress was very polite and attentive. The only small complaint that I have is the food took a little long getting to our table. I thought was odd, because the restaurant itself wasn't very busy at the time. I will definitely be back to IHOP down the road for breakfast,lunch, or dinner anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Having a homey and breakfast craving anytime of the night , this is the place to go to, the waiter is friendly and nice, pretty laid back and I like that, and let us have our time in checking out the menu. I ordered my usual strawberry pancake with cream cheese and I can say it's good. The creaminess of the pancakes are just right with those cream cheese chunks on it. Hubby ordered the stuffed French toast and he said he likes it, a different twist on the usual toast. The syrup is also great, we always opt on the pecan flavor ,but one thing that's off is for the milk shake, although it's tasty, the advertised container isn't what they're using ~ the shake was on a water glass instead of the traditional milkshake glass they advertised right by the door~ that's what made hubby a lil disappointed since it's kinda false advertising, wouldn't you agree? Thus the 4 stars.."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Actually the word to describe their service is abysmal. They need to train their staff.  We came in as a group of 4 around 11:30 a.m. and was told that the wait time was 20 minutes. We didn't mind the wait time. But what ticked us off was that the waitress sent  one group of 4 and a group of 6... two groups that came in 10 and 15 mins after us... Yet they got seated before us.   I went up to the Manager and asked why our table still haven't been called and told her that, groups who came in after us are already seated. When she checked the list, our table was listed but the hostess crossed it off without calling us. Mind you we sat right in front of the cash register, just so we wont miss our table. The manager sat us right away after I talked to her.  The bad service didn't stop there. Our server had to be called several times to remind him of our refill. He even had the nerve to tell us that we can leave his tip right on the table or include it when we pay at the till. I honestly wont ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Staff is pretty friendly. Quiet restaurant.   My son enjoyed their happy birthday song and desert on his birthday"}
{"text":"I originally reviewed this place having only been here once. That was a few months before I met my boyfriend, who loves this place as much as I do. We go there all the time now and have yet to be disappointed.  We've only had to wait for a table once, and even that was only about 15 minutes on a weekend morning. Instead of putting your name down, they give you a card with the name they'll call you by when there's a table ready. We got Jessica Alba, and I also head named like Cinderella and Princess Elsa XD. Then when you're seated it's usually not that long of a wait either. Must have just been 1 bad night the first time I was there.  The decor is fairly decent for a breakfast place. I had no idea it used to be a blockbuster!   And of corse, I love the originality of the menu. We love breakfast food, but most breakfast restaurants have almost identical menus. This has tons of yummy stuff you would've never imagined."}
{"text":"I came here on my anniversary and waited for 20 minutes for someone to take our order, my boyfriend had to go to the front and remind them that we're even there. They weren't even busy at the time. Very disappointed with the service. Once the girl came and asked for our order she didn't even apologized, she simply said \"I didn't see you\" and laughed. I have no problem with the food and all I was just disappointed with the service. I expected better."}
{"text":"Really people!? This is a terrible US chain and you're giving it a four or five star rating? Get real and go have breakfast at one of Calgary's many fantastic locally owned and operated breakfast places. I recommend: 80th and Ivy, Galaxie, Blue Star Diner, Diner Deluxe or even (heaven forbid) Nellie's."}
{"text":"Only IHOP in the city the food was good I ordered the stuffed french toast, my partner ordered the Colorado omelette from the looks of it he enjoyed it. I enjoyed my stuffed french toast. The service was good. It was eerily empty in there though gave me the h eebeejeebies"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Disgusting food that's tasteless, processed and poorly made. Will not return and not worth trying out"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Went in today for lunch. Were seated in a booth. After waiting 10 minutes - I overhead someone in another booth say \" we've been waiting 5 minutes and noone has come around for drinks or anything\"  I go to the manager and let him know noone has come around. He apologizes and personally takes the order.  ( He tells us there was a shift change and that is why we were forgotten) I order pancakes and red potato hash described as red potatoes with green peppers and onions. My hubby orders the breakfast sampler.  We wair and wait and wait - another 30 minutes goes by - I check on the other other table that had to wait earlier as well - they have food! I let the manager know that we dont yet have food - he apologizes again and within 5 minutes the food comes out  ( this is now 45 minutes after we arrived) - but wait it gets better - or worse... The red potato has didnt come - I asked for it - it was a bowl of potatoes, just potatoes not a hash  The manager seemed stumped - I explained to him this was not what was described - it was described as a hash with onions and peppers. He came back with the bowl of potatoes only this time now sprinkled on top were  raw cold diced green peppers and onions. COLD.  Also the breakfast sampler that my partner ordered was supposed to come with 2 pancakes and it didnt have them. We also  had to ask for those. When I asked what the problem was and why we were waiting so long, the manager said it was because the kitchen staff didn't know how to poach an egg. WTF? Apparently it was an all new kitchen staff - but still - seriously.  We told the manager we weren't going to eat the food and were going to leave. The manager said that we could eat for free - but  no - we were definitely over the whole experience.  We love IHOP- its a guilty pleasure, but there was nothing, and I mean nothing pleasant about the experience."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I was happy to try as I had seen many appetizing commercials. I had seen many commercials on TV about it and had put it on my list of things to do. I went for brunch with my bro, and we were not disappointed. We were served pancakes of every colors and flavors. For me it was a completely new and enjoyable experience. I also like the fact the coffee kept coming, it was a good way to wake up.  The service staff was patient and helpful, despite the continuing influx of customers. The portions sizes were quite large and satisfying, I even got to take a little bit home. All in all, this is definitely a restaurant I would come back too as there are many different flavors of pancakes I have yet to try."}
{"text":"We've given this place another try.  This time it was 8:45am on a Sat. morning.  There were many people waiting and they were taking names.  They gave me a card that had Justin Beiber's name and said I would get to meet him in 10 minutes. It turns out they give similar cards to everyone who is waiting.  I don't suppose they told the person with the Cinderella card the identical story.  It was a bit longer than 10 minutes but the call for Justin Beiber came and we got seated in our booth.  We were commanded by the mid-40-ish waitress in braided pigtails to give up my husband's walker.  The aisles had high chairs and extra chairs in the aisle.  No one else had to give up theirs.  If there was a big scramble for the exit doors, they'd all get out except my husband who needs his walker to walk.  We ordered our food and when it came, the 2 pancakes were on a tiny 5\" side-plate.  The remainder of the meal was on a larger plate.  I immediately switched mine around as I don't want the syrup to pour off the pancakes onto the table.  My husband did not follow suit.  Therefore, the syrup poured off the little side-plate of pancakes onto a puddle on the table.  Eventually when the waitress came back I asked to see the  manager.  When he came, I pointed out that the side-plate is too small.  He answered that it is 'IHOP's standards\" and he isn't able to change the standards.  To rectify it this one time an exception was made and a larger plate was provided.  This is when it gets interesting.  She took my husband's fork and transferred his pancakes onto the larger plate for him, not too delicately, so the pancake was torn in places.  She also wiped up the puddle of syrup.  It was a tacky method of dealing with a minor problem.  The food was OK, but hubby didn't eat all of his torn pancake."}
{"text":"iHop is awesome and it is finally in Calgary! For those who have never been to the popular breakfast franchise think Denny's only 4 syrup's to choose from and more pancakes also less trademarked menu items (seriously you got to look closer at a Denny's menu, that place is run by lawyers - they even trademarked the work \"sampler\" to describe their sample platter along with every variation of 'slam'. okay tangent done).   In Calgary iHOP kind of a big deal. Expect to wait an hour. Don't expect a breakfast miracle remember \"You don't go to an iHop, you end up at an iHop\". If only it was 24/7.  Also for those wondering: Business Hours are 6 am- 10 pm 7 days a week (as of Dec 2012) I Called"}
{"text":"I guess this is an OK stop if you know what you are going for. But we have experienced only slow service, and mediocre food"}
{"text":"Here I sit.  10 hours after eating IHOP, bubbling stomach and explosive diarrhea.   My boyfriend and I taking turns peeing from our butts.  I don't wish this upon any one of my enemies.   Don't eat here.  Run for the hills....or you will be after you eat here."}
{"text":"Food was warm at best and service was inconsistent. Came in the beginning and never returned until meals were over. Requested and orange juice and it took over 5 minutes to receive it. Normally I would not take issue to waiting but when the place is not busy I do not see why you should have to wait 5 minutes for a juice."}
{"text":"IHOP being a new restaurant in town, warrants the excitement of trying something new.  I will not be hurrying back, not worth the line ups to get seating.  I ordered eggs Benedict, the ham was cold, out of the fridge.  Ricky's has our continued support.  We returned to give it another try.  This time my eggs Benny plate was swimming in hollandaise sauce.  The comment from the waitress was that customers were complaining that there wasn't enough sauce.  Again, back to Ricky's!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like Ihop. REALLY wanted to like Ihop. You see, I've always liked Ihop in other cities. I enjoy the pancakes and the inexpensive food for a relatively alright quality. Unfortunately, Ihop in Calgary has been a huge disappointment.  I have to echo most of the reviews here. The pancakes were subpar, the coffee was weak, and the service wasn't awesome. That said, I actually have ate at other Ihops and thoroughly enjoyed it... and it's possible that there are kinks to work out before finding the groove. I'll probably give it another chance... when I muster the gumption."}
{"text":"Went on New Year's eve morning, and won't return. Food was gross - even the pancakes! And the coffee was the worse than the stuff I make at home.  Waitress might have been new, so I'll give her some slack, but had to write every word of our order down, and still messed it up."}
{"text":"IHOP is pretty standard breakfast food. My daughter loves it because they have two sided crayons. She is four so it doesn't take much......  I have never had a bad meal there hut honestly it's never fantastic either. I think that the best way to describe it is that it's an ok place to have a reasonably priced and reasonable tasting family meal."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The sevice is always good. Being called Tweety Bird to let you know a table is ready for you is always amusing. Being 35 years old and still asking the lady that's there every weekend making balloon animals to make you a ninja turtle is awesome.  Yes, as an adult I asked for a balloon creation. Yes, I'm comfortable with that. I am enlightened."}
{"text":"Lets start this review by telling you YOU'RE AT IHOP. Don't expect out of this world service or some amazing meal. They're making pancakes and sausages.   My only complaint about this place is that they could have designed the space better. The waiting area is HUGE! If they took out a third of it they could have enough tables to seat those people that they've put out benches for. I get that they're only busy on the weekend, but how how many people do they lose because they don't want to wait 30-45 minutes for a table?  Our server was fine. He greeted us and got our drinks quickly, gave us enough time to browse the large menu before bugging us to get our order, and checked on us once we had our meals and to offer refills.   The food took a little longer than expected to get to our table but it hit the spot. I ordered the breakfast sampler. All of the meats were cooked nicely and the scrambled eggs weren't over done or dried out. The pancakes were light and fluffy.  To drink I got the Splashberry. It was the highlight of the meal. They just take some OJ and put in a splash of lime soda and a scoop of the strawberry topping they use on the pancakes and french toast. Because of the chunks of strawberry your best bet is to skip the straw and just drink fro the glass directly.  Side note: They have the all you can eat pancakes deal on right now. I thought about this instead of what I ordered until I did a quick calculation. To get a similar combo to the breakfast sampler ($10.69) with the AYCE pancakes its $15.25. This means you're paying almost $5 extra for ACYE pancakes. Unless you're going to eat an additional 4-6 pancakes on top of the two you already get with the meal, the ACYE pancakes are NOT a good deal."}
{"text":"Was really craving for some blueberry pancakes as I just returned from a city in UK without any decent north American style breakfast.  Even though the red velvet pancake was very tempting as well, I got the blueberry pancske breakfast anyhow. The portion size was huge, 2 pancakes, sausage, eggs and hash brown. The pancakes absolutely hit my sweet spot, they had blueberry stuffed in the pancakes along with a blueberry sauce on top. They were out of the world! Even better than what I hoped for.  The service was amazing too, the waitress was very attending.  Great experience overall, will come back another day for More pancakes!"}
{"text":"WAAAAY better than the one in Edmonton! When my girlfriends suggested we do IHOP for dinner last week, I was a little hesitant. Breakfast for dinner? Haven't done that in years! I remembered how awful the food was the last time I tried IHOP (see previous review) but I decided to give it a shot since we were starving. I was expecting a huge line or at least somewhat of a wait, but being 9PM on a Thursday, it wasn't bad at all. We were seated right away and ordered our food. Well to my surprise, it all came out pretty quickly and it was hot! Who woulda thunk it?? My meal...was DELISH. I was really, really happy with everything and our server was great. I think we each spent around $20 all in, so you definitely get your money's worth. I was STUFFED. Speaking of...stuffed french toast, anyone? Mmmmmm....."}
{"text":"Sorry, but IHOP blew it.  We were seated fairly promptly, but then spent the next 15 minutes watching the waiters saunter by our table to other tables.  Not once were we even acknowledged as being seated, and someone would be with us shortly.    We didn't even get a cup of coffee.  Come to that ... didn't even get the opportunity to order one.  The table beside us were waiting for their coffee to arrive, and it appeared about halfway through the time we waited.  After 15 minutes, we left the restaurant and went down the road to Ricky's for breakfast - where we were seated and had coffee in front of us in about 30 seconds.  The IHOP staff seemed disengaged (to say the least), moving slowly and very disinterested in doing their jobs.  The floor seemed understaffed, and the service reflected it.  Staff also gave the impression of being seriously undertrained, with the hostess quite unclear on where to seat people.  I can't comment on the food, but if it takes more than 15 minutes for a server to get to a table, it doesn't exactly make me optimistic that the food would be warm when it arrived at the table.  Lousy service, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Third time at IHOP and it has always been busy. Again, we lined up for at least 20 minutes under the name \"Elsa\"(from Frozen), isn't that cute! There were 10 people before us, but the wait wasn't too bad at all.  The place was packed, but we still got our orders in quickly and our server was super personable.   We waited(there were 3 of us) for about 30 or so minutes for our food, which is understandable because the place is quite busy. But 30 minutes isn't that long to wait really, because I have waited longer than that at a restaurant that was not busy.  The food was definitely worth the wait. We ordered their new french toasted donuts - applefritter and strawberries and cream. Both came with your own choice of bacon, sausages, hash browns and 2 eggs. And we also ordered the cinastax pancakes. They were all great and we had no complaints whatsoever.  I am already planning on coming back to order their maple bacon french toasted donut this upcoming weekend!"}
{"text":"Having an iHop in Calgary is awesome. So the food isn't out of this world original and perhaps it isn't the most elegant of atmospheres; but that's also not what they ever tried to be  It is a clean location to eat that has good selection and well prepared food. It's clean, the staff are friendly and 'usually' quick and attentive. When you do get less that n acceptable service management is interested and reactive.   Family oriented and often busy so can get a bit loud; again a reflection on their standards and focus."}
{"text":"The thing you need to know about IHOP is in the US it's nothing special. It's just another Denny's. Unlimited coffee, decent prices, consistent service and 4 flavors of syrup. Looks and feels the same as American IHOP,  with a slightly different menu and slightly higher price point."}
