{"text":"As a a Vietnamese, I am truly disappointed by the food there. 

I tried a lot of things on their menu, but still, there wasn't anything close to the real deal. The pho was okay, the sandwich had a plain taste, the spring rolls were really oily, but still crunchy... The list goes on and on. But I guess the quality is okay for a Vietnamese fast food restaurant and it's cheap. 

I'd recommend it if you want something cheap and a bit asian."}
{"text":"Not the best Vie & Nam I've gone to. 

No one in line and still waited a significant amount of time! The Pork Bahn Mi I ate was underwhelming... simply didn't feel fresh and was tasteless. This is an issue for franchises, where one experience at one location simply doesn't reflect what you'd experience at the other. I understand it's fast food court Viet but other locations are much better. Pho is OK.

Won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Vie & Nam isn't fast food...Just good Vietnamese food in a hurry!

Located in the food court of the Industrielle Building, they serve good Vietnamese food at a fairly responsible price. 

When I want a \"grab and go\" lunch because I'm in between meetings, Vie&Nam is on my list of places. For $5 (all taxes included) you can grab a pork or chicken sandwich that they will toast it warm for you. 

You have the option to have it made spicy or regular - I always take mine spicy!"}
{"text":"I had the Combo #4....Grilled steak, rice and vegetables.    The beef was nice and tasty...done on a hot grill....delicious.... The rice and vegetables were also very well done....great fast food choice in Ville Marie-Gare Centrale."}
{"text":"Of course, you can't compare the fast food pho with the authentic pho. It will obviously taste different, but to be honest, I quite like it. I haven't tried the other food there but I am willing to try! The portions are a bit small, it costs about 10$ for a regular size (+taxes)."}
{"text":"Very good pho. I've had better, but I was very pleased with theirs. I ordered spicy but I had to add sriracha. Perfectly hit the spot after traipsing in the snow."}

J'ai essayé beaucoup de petits comptoirs et de restos vietnamiens, mais j'ai vraiment été déçu de Vie & Nam. Je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux d'un comptoir situé en plein coeur du centre-ville, dans une foire alimentaire. Là où l'achalandage ne tarde pas à se faire sentir, surtout en saison chaude avec la course à l'air climatisé.

On vous vend un sandwich de votre choix, type Banh mi mais on vous charge 2 fois trop cher pour le si peu de viande qu'on y met avec une petite garniture fraîche (carottes, laitue, coriande, etc...). On goutte davantage la garniture et les assaisonnements que la présence de la viande. On ne trouve que ça, maintenant, à Montréal, c'est vraiment très décevant comme attitude de restaurateur. On tente ensuite de griller votre petit sandwich au four-grillette mais il en sort tout aussi blanc qu'il l'était avant.

On vous offre le combo avec petite soupe, qui est bien peu dire par rapport à la bonne soupe vietnamienne habituelle typique. Elle est fade, peu caractérisée, peu parfumée. On en sort déçu à 8,75 $ alors que ça aurait value facilement 5,95 $.

Si votre commande est pour emporter, on oublie ensuite de vous donner les ustensils mais on vous donne le sac, pour y mettre votre commande, avec une petite serviette de table au fond. Service moins qu'ordinaire, on veut vous voir repartir plus vite.

SUIVANT !

I've tried a lot of small food counters and viet places, so I was very disapointed with Vie & Nam. I thought it would be much more interesting since it's downtown, in the heart of the city's food courts. That's where people converge, espacially during the hot season, running for air conditionning.

They sell you a sandwich, among other stuff, Banh mi style, but you're being charged twice too much for what you receive, so little meat with fresh garnish (carrots, salad, coriander, etc...). You mostly taste the garnish but almost to none of the meat, just enough to know it's there. Nowadays, it's a common custom with Banh Mi sandwich, and vietnamese places, to let you down with the meat. They, then, try to grill your sandwich inside a small small-oven-grill but it comes out still as white as it was before.

You also have the combo pack with a small soup, which is also letting you down with the taste. It's mostly generic style then caracterized, as it should be in the typical vietnamese cooking. You leave with 8,75 $ less in your pocket as it should be worth only 5,95 $.

If your order is made \"to go\", they forget to put ustensils in your bag, but the bag has at its bottom a small napkin, just in case. Service is slim to none, less then ordinary, they want you to leave fast.

{"text":"This is my go-to for a good bowl of pho; there are locations in the Eaton Centre and the food court in the Industrielle Building. Both locations are very good. I always get 1c (pho soup with chicken), and add spicy saté option. It gives the broth a tiny bit of spice, but a big punch of flavour. It it simply delicious and a generous portion for the price. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good bowl of pho! As a previous commenter has put it, it's not what I would call fast-food, but good Vietnamese food in a hurry!"}
