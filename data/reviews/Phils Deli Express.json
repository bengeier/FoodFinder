{"text":"We go to this place multiple times a week for breakfast. I order the veggie omelette from Phils, it's great, not too greasy, and they actually saut√© the veggies.  Phil is an awesome dude!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a breakfast sandwich because I had read about them on Charlotte agenda and trying to try smaller new places uptown. I wanted a sandwich and not a plate only like 3 choices.  Sandwich was $4 and change....for 2 slices of bacon egg and cheddar that didn't even cover the white bread.  Maybe the plates are better. Wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special either."}
{"text":"Average experience. $10 for a chicken sandwich and fries a little steep for a carryout restaurant. Nice size chicken breast. Fries were not cooked to order but good. Lady at the front not cold but not friendly either."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It's one of very, very few places in the area that is open for breakfast, and if you're hungry, Phil's omelet is amazing!  Their lunch menu is extensive, and everything I've tried was awesome.  I work with hundreds of people in one of the big buildings uptown, and nobody I know ever went there.  I ordered a lunch for a group of 12, and everyone loved what they got.  The customer service is fantastic, its one of the friendliest staff all around that I've seen uptown.  I hope the word spreads and Phil's sticks around for a while."}
{"text":"ok sandwiches depending on what you get. the worst and most apparent flaw is there stingy condiment policy..... they give you 3 tiny packs of ketchup. if u ask for more they give u one. cheap.   do not lose business because of ketchup. take it out from behind the counter and give customers access. clover joes does and your sandwiches arnt half as good.  too much competition near you to not make a minor change that would increase your revenue."}
