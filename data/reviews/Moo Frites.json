{"text":"What a wonderful business. The fries were absolutely delicious (definitely try the kimchi ones!). The owner uses J Kenji Lopez-Alt's double fry method and it makes a huge difference. Perfectly crispy fries and homemade sauces. Everything you could want in a fry shop. It takes me back to Amsterdam."}
{"text":"For fries, you cannot get any better, they have a huge selection of sauces and different special fries, which come with a variety of toppings. Their poutine is a favourite of mine for a bare bones poutine with some squeaky cheese curds. The prices are a little high for just fries but I have not had better fries in the city. Their blanch and freeze method results in crispy outsides and soft perfectly cooked centres."}
{"text":"My friends and I were enjoying an evening in Kensington Market, and decided to make several stops around the area.   Fries with a twist... Why not?   We tried the Japo frites, which is basically fries topped with a bunch of dried seaweed, a drizzle of wasabi mayo, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. It is such a simple combination of ingredients and it was very tasty. However, the fries were pretty greasy and on top of that, the toppings were not layered, so by the time we reached the middle, we were left with greasy topping-less fries!  I like the concept, but I gotta say...for what it is, I think it is overpriced."}
{"text":"Ordered a box of large Japo-frites to share. The frites were neither crispy nor stale. The wasabi mayo got to be a bit much mid-way through. It'd be awesome if they came with the option to add bonito flakes.   There's lots of space to stand in line, but with primarily bar seats available, it's not a place to sit and eat with friends."}
{"text":"I admit I have passed this spot a couple of times and not because I didn't want to go in but I just didn't think anything of it....I was sadly wrong!!!  This is definitely a hidden gem!!!  I remember going to Disney world and think they must be crazy selling only McDonald's fries out of stand solely but honestly it works just like this spot.  Yes it is small and has limited seating but thanx to Mr.Lee and his welcoming personality this place is  just big enough.  I had the Japo fries...DELICIOUS and FRESH and my partner had the poutine...He said it's was even better then a Montreal poutine.  I will not over look this place again,and neither should you!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a lover of fries and have to say that Moo Frites has some of the best in the city.   The fries are crisp and golden on the outside, but fluffy on the inside. The guys there seem to really value the quality of their fries. There's a ton of dips to try out. Service was great with them letting you taste test the dips before deciding.   Best of all is the cone the fries come in. The little pocket for your dip is a great idea and the cone is handy for on the go walking and munching. It's a small space with a few bar stools lined against the wall if you decide to dine-in.   Will definitely be back for more fries and to try out other dips. We had the garlic parmesan dip and it was delish!"}
{"text":"I was very skeptical at first. I never thought you can have a place that only sells fries that will also fill you up. Boy was I wrong. The fries are probably by far the best I've had -- crispy, hot (temperature), and golden. Once you bite down, you can feel the substance and tastiness of the fries.  To top it off, they have a very good selection of sauces that just go the extra mile! Well done!"}
{"text":"The tastiest fries, feel sorry for vegans that are missing out on the beef fat gravy. You don't know what you are missing."}
{"text":"We tried the Japo Frittes, and it was very good. The combination of the sauce and fries worked out very well (for the Japo Frittes, have not tried other sauce yet).  Definitely a must try if you're in the area and want something to munch.  :)"}
{"text":"Fresh cut Belgian fries cooked in beef fat. Need I say more? They were AH MAZING. I've tried mostly all the dipping sauces, and they're all tasty, but if I had to choose, the nosy wasabi and peanut sauce wins!The owner of the joint is super friendly and really passionate about what he does!  I highly recommend ordering the Japo Frites(Topped with shredded seaweed, wasabi mayo and sesame seeds)! Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Big delicious fries! The sauces are incredible and unique! If the weather was good enough you can buy your frites and walk in the market."}
{"text":"I bookmarked moo frites in Yelp a long time ago after reading about them in the newspaper.  The cone cups and Belgian frites caught my attention and I was super excited to check it out.  Today I split a kimchi small order of fries with a friend.  IT. Was. Delicious.  I will be returning very soon to try more options.  The staff were friendly here and other then the food being awesome the prices reasonable, the little details got me good.  The frites container is a cone shape that has a little cardboard lip to hold the sauce.  So. Brilliant.  Like really brilliant.  I won't hold back on my praise because it really is cool!  You don't need to have both a cup for sauce and your fries in your hands at the same time because it's in the same container!  Maybe you have to see it to get it.   THEN my friend and I realized that the wooden tables that you sit at have a diamond shaped hole cut out so you can drop your frites cone in the hole and have your hands free to devour the frites.  Ahmazing!  Can't wait to come back and try more options!"}
{"text":"Amazing fries! Possibly the best I've ever had. Tried the new Nacho Fries- highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm Belgian and well the fries are close but doesn't meet my expectations. You will never find fries with their skins on in Belgium sorry..."}
{"text":"I love fries and I love dipping sauce. Almost died when I saw their extensive list of dipping sauces to choose from. And their fries, their thick-cut, steaming hot, delicious deep fried fries... If I had to get fat at a restaurant, it'd probably be here."}
{"text":"Fries are one of my guilty pleasures and having this place close to my Wednesday evening class near the U of T campus is dangerous! The staff is super friendly. The guy behind the counter recognized me from the one time I went in to check out the place and he was like \"Oh you are back!\"     They have a variety of different dips that you can choose from and the size/ portions are pretty big. I got the small size and I was pretty full. For the side dip, I wanted to try something different. I would normally get the Chipotle dip but instead I got Joppie (one of their top sellers, don't remember the ingredients). What I also liked about this place is that they give you a sample of the dipping to try, prior to ordering. Deciding on a dip wasn't an easy task, hahaha.   I will be visiting this place again. Highly recommend if you are in the Kensington area!"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the jap fries.  This comes with seaweed, wasabi mayo and sesame seeds layered on top of the regular plain fries.  Wasn't too impressed, the distribution of toppings wasn't even.  The top part was decent  but the bottom was plain, fries were too greasy.  Would work much better on a plate instead of in a cone. Next time I would recommend getting plain fries and trying out the dipping sauces instead."}
{"text":"Must try if you're in Kensington Market! My friend and I got large Japo Frites. Flavour was point on, we enjoyed the light wasabi kick! Definitely shareable! Will come back to try other fries on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"A cheap dinner in Kensington Market? Check. Peanut sauce on fries? Check. Garlic mayo on fries? Check. Fries that are crispy on the outside, mealy on the inside, never soggy, made-to-order, put in a cool sauce-holding cone, and never too greasy? Check!  This place has it all, my friends. You need to try these fries. Now."}
{"text":"Excellent frites. Was here earlier this year and super happy to get back again. Love the frites and sauces"}
{"text":"Great big thick cut fries. I've been twice and both times got them fried in beef fat. They are great even without the numerous choices of sauce."}
{"text":"The chunky fries and great sauces make this place really special. Fries have great weight to them and it does fill you up real quick. It's awesome to munch on this as you go."}
{"text":"Pretty good fries. I had the plain frites with spicy mayo and while they were pretty good I will say they do not compare to real Belgian frites. They should definitely give more sauce with their fries and not charge so much extra if you want more. I would go back though and try some of their combo fries with more toppings."}
{"text":"OMG I friggen love this place. I have been here a few times and everybody I have brought here loves this place. Small place, I missed it the first time. I ordered the frites of course with the parmesan peppercorn sauce. I loved the sauce so much that I ended up going back for more. The frites were medium sized wedges which were not oily or dry. Very nice! But keep in mind the regular portion is pretty hefty so you walk out of there pretty full. I also love the fact that the bar table has a diamond cut out to hold your frites. Pretty smart design!"}
{"text":"Yes, the fries were good. But I waited almost 15 mins for them, with only two orders ahead of me. They have 4 fryers and they were only using one. For. Each.Order. Then they placed each fry individually in the cone with tongs?  Also, I asked the very friendly and kind girl behind the counter which of the sauces was the closest to a traditional Belgian aioli. She looked at me blankly, did not know the answer.  She offered to let me try whatever dipping sauces I wanted before I made my selection, which I appreciated, but I still think she should be able to answer it. Btw, I chose 'Frite Sauce - caper, anchovy & parsley' and it tasted pretty darn close to what I was expecting in terms of a traditional mayo. I know, 'Frite Sauce' seems obvious enough, but the caper & parsley threw me.  I love fries, especially Belgian style. And I go to Kensington often enough, but I won't return simply because of the wait time and cost."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Got the poutine, the sauce and cheese is very good! Altho i'm not crazy about the thick cut fries. I also love that the cheese and gravy is evenly mixed in all the fries, so u are not left with any dry fries."}
{"text":"It's about time Toronto got a decent Belgian frites spot, and what better place to open one than Kensington Market? I came across Moo Frites completely by accident, and having tried similar restaurants elsewhere, I had to give it a go.  I ordered a small frites with curry mayo and garlic mayo, which came to about $5. The portion is a little on the small side but the quality of the frites and house made dipping sauces more than made up for it.  Deliciously crisp and hot on the outside, fluffy on the inside, these frites were absolute heaven. The curry mayo was l decent but my favourite by far was the garlic mayo - absolutely delicious! I can't wait to try all of the other dipping sauces as they all looked amazing.  At the end of the day, they are just fries and it's a little on the expensive side. Get an order along with a few dipping sauces to share with a friend and it'll keep you going as you walk around Kensington Market. The service is extremely friendly and they are happy to let you sample if you're not sure what to order."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend! Easily, best fries in Toronto. Made to order, not too greasy, crunchy on outside but soft inside, perfect sized fries, lots of unique and equally tasty sauces. Prices are reasonable and sizes are great to share or scarf down on your own.   I got the Samurai sauce which was a little spicy and great with the fries. Staff are very helpful suggesting sauces and letting you try them all so that you're happy with your purchase. Option to deep-fry in beef oil which might be a little unhealthier, but you're eating fries, so who cares? The beef oil gave it an extra dimension which was definitely worth the $1 extra.   I have had Pommes Frites in NY and frites while in Belgium. This is better than NY for sure.  Worth the visit and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Moo Frites serves Belgian style fries with dipping sauce flavours from around the world. Also, Moo Frites offers poutine like signature dishes.   Frites are better than french fries because frites are not greasy like french fries. If you get hash browns  and french fries at McDonald's and A & W, they are completely soaked inside with deep fryer oil. When I eat hash browns and french fries, I wrap them in napkins and eat them after I finish eating my burger. The amount of fryer oil absorbed by the napkins is unbelievable. Imagine the amount of fryer oil ingested over a lifetime. Gross! You don't get frites like that. When I eat frites, they go straight into my mouth after dipping some sauce.  The frites are cooked by specialized fryers Moo Frites has imported from Europe. These fryers are more like a frite cooker machine because of its boxy like appearance. Thick cut potatoes are loaded into the frite cooker and in about 3-1/2 minutes the perfectly  cooked frites are ready for eating. The frites are cooked golden brown on the outside with a fluffy potato inside. There is significantly less oil absorbed outside and inside by a frite than a french fry.  Moo Frites offers frites in 3 different cone sizes (regular, large, jumbo) with a choice of no dipping sauce, 1 dipping sauce or 2 and more dipping sauce. I usually order a large size with 1 dipping sauce, which is ideal for a meal. The 20 choices of dipping sauce make eating frites more tasty. Some of the flavours available are garlic mayo, tartar sauce, chipotle sauce, curry ketchup, peanut sauce, nosy wasabi.  If the weather is reasonably warm, I like to walk around Kensington Market while eating my frites. If I stay inside, I place the cone of frites into the cut out in the counter that holds your food in place.  There are 7 signature poutine like dishes on the menu. Look at the photo below for the menu selection. My favourites are the Japo Frites with seaweed and wasabi mayo, Kimchi Frites with Korean Kimchi and garlic mayo.  New beverages are featured on the menu board. In house made lemonade and hot chocolate (available during winter) are available. I ordered a green tea lemonade, which was refreshing and not too sweet.  I will have to plan more visits soon to Moo Frites so I can order all the dipping sauces I not tried yet."}
{"text":"This place has the best fries ever!   I absolutely loved the toppings, I tried the Japo and it was so good! I also tasted a few other sauces and would love to come again and try more."}
{"text":"Went here because of the hype & can't say I was disappointed but at the same time I don't think it was something special.  We had the Kimchi fries and fries with Siracha sauce  I would suggest you visit this place if you really are craving fries"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Super Good! Crispy fries with delicious sauces!  The fries: it sounds weird but you taste the potato! The crispy outside then the mash potato like inside was just the right balance! Doesn't feel oily and heavy. Not some dark, week old, oily fries. Golden crispiness perfect!  The sauce: I got the Japo fries and it was so good..! I liked it better than the seaweed fries from Japadog in Vancouver! Might be expected but you taste the roasted seaweed and sesame, not many places that use these toppings give that flavour. And the wassabi mayo actually tasted like wasabi, like there was a kick. So perfectly balanced with the crispy fries.  Definitely worth a try.  PLUS: Owner is super nice and fun (he was dancing to Meghan Trainor's \"No\" when we walked in) and totally willing to take a picture with you if you like ;)"}
{"text":"As a self confessed French fries lover I wanted to check this out.  A nice little shop next to the store my friend was buying meat at so we stopped in.  A small Belgian fries in a come was $5 and came with one sauce.  There were so many sauces to choose from!  I went with the garlic mayo.  The fries were handed to me very hot and full In the cone with a little built in holder for my sauce.  They were very tasty and usually I don't like thick cut fries because they're dry but these were perfect!  The garlic mayo was delicious and garlicky.  Definitely recommend Moo Frites!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best fries I've ever had in my life. And they are consistently quality. Their Belgian fries are better than any I had in Belgium. The fries are super crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside - this is done by freezing already fried fries and double frying it - since it's frozen it allows the outside to crisp for longer while the inside doesn't dry out.   Their poutine is also the best I've ever had, and I eat quite a bit of poutine. It's their homemade beef fat gravy that really does it. It's thick, a little bit creamy, and the perfect level of salty. AND A FEW CHEESE CURDS LITERALLY SQUEAKED AGAINST MY TEETH. THAT IS THE MARK OF A GREAT CHEESE CURD. ACTUALLY SO EXCITING TO FEEL THAT CHEESE CURD SQUEAK. You don't find that too often outside of Quebec.   Save all your calories for this place."}
{"text":"Went back again recently as my friend really wanted to try this place so I relented and ordered some frites fried in beef fat with spicy ketchup again.  The results were pleasantly surprising.  Both the frites and spicy ketchup were significantly better the second time around.  The frites were a little saltier (and thus tastier for my palate) and the spicy ketchup had much better heat to it.  And again, the people behind the counter were very friendly and offered great customer service.  A nice little place."}
{"text":"When my family and I first hit Toronto we made a bee-line for the Kensington Market to hunt down Moo Frites!!!!!!   We walked around for a while and then there it was!  The light at the end of our tunnel.  It's a small spot with a small counter that serves the most amazing frites ever.  We ordered a Medium size with 3 sauces.  They were SPICY KETCHUP, SAMURAI and the GARLIC MAYO.  We also requested that the fries be cooked in the BEEF TALLOW.  In my opinion this is the only way to cook a true frite.  We were presented with a fry that was crispy on the outside with a hot tender center.  They were full of flavor via the beef tallow by themselves but dipping in one of the several sauces available to you gives you a different taste experience with each bite.  DO NOT miss out on your chance to visit MOO FRITES on your next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"These are just fries. Fries with special dips, but still just fries. Nothing overly special about the fries, and kind of expensive when compared to your local mcdonalds, but I guess it's about the same price as what you might get charged at a full-service restaurant (only difference being this place isn't full service, and this place has lots of sauce options)."}
{"text":"There's just something unique about these frites. They were crispy and delicious!!  The Joppie (curry, tomato, mayo?) sauce was fantastic!!!  Highly recommended!  We got there early so there wasn't much of a lone but it got busy fast. Go early and go hungry!!!"}
{"text":"We visited a third time. Tried the kimchi fries. It was good, but the kimchi fries at bahn mi boys are better"}
{"text":"What can I say other than yum.  I lived in Belgium for a few years and the are a very close second.  I will recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I love all things potato and I have cravings for fries constantly. So when Moo Frites started getting publicity, everyone told me about it.   Went with two friends and this joint is pretty cute, modern decor. The owner and the guy working with him are very sociable and easy going. They let us try as many flavours of sauce as we wanted (granted we were the only ones at the time). I opted for the beef tallow fries. Go big or go home, right? Ordered a large as well. Seriously, potatoes do not make me full and I love fries!! Hope you guys get the point. Anyways, the fries were crispy and soft inside. They are very good for thick cut fries. I like how the staff try fries from each batch for quality control--I appreciate that!   In the end, I had trouble hitting halfway of my fries...man it must've been the beef fat or something cus I was done! The fat definitely made it heavier but added a nice beefy taste.  The fries are pricey though, being gourmet fries with special sauces and all. I won't be a regular customer to not break the bank but will be back!  P.S. Good luck carrying the fries away from the counter. Guarantee that a couple will fall from the majestic cone =("}
{"text":"Location/Service Right in the heart of Kensington Market. Restaurant is not hard to miss with a very eye catching exterior. Inside the restaurant is very small with little to almost no seating, definitely a more buy and go style.   Food Tried the classic poutine. The fries were crispy and not soggy, topping it off with curd cheese and gravy made it a very comfort food feeling. Portion was big too, so it's nice to share with a few friends.   Voted as the best fries in town, would definitely come back again to try other flavors they have available!"}
{"text":"O-V-E-R-R-A-T-T-E-D....  Fries were nothing special and workers there are clueless. I don't even trust them making my food.  When you only have 2 customers that made an order and you give the fries to the person that just came in instead of the one that been waiting for more than 15 mins. Good job. You fail.  It is not that hard to keep track.  The workers after looked at each other and wanted to point the blame when they realize this.  Def won't be coming back here.  Back to the fries they were greasy and the toppings were just on the top after that you be eating nasty greasy fries."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday at night and it wasn't busy.  Pros: - Good portions - Well priced - Good service  Cons: - Taste could be a little better"}
{"text":"I lived in Belgium (Flanders) for a while. Frites (Belgian French fries) are a big thing there... actually the Flemish folk even claim to have invented this dish. At last I decided to give a try to these frites in Toronto. I would walk by this spot oftentimes and saw long lines of customers, it never was empty. When we came there, we had to wait a few minutes. Was it worth it? Must-try? Maybe!   They offer a rather wide array of sauces and make tasty unsoggy crispy potatoes in hot oil, but to me it seems Moo (!) should cook all fries in beef fat as a default option! Real Belgian fries are always made in beef fat, or otherwise they taste just not right. Sorry, if you are vegan. I will likely come there again, though.  It's both a good grab and go takeout or eat-in spot. The well thought-out thing is the slots for cones in the table! Awesomely authentic and fusion at the same time.  BTW, garlic mayo is truly tasty!"}
{"text":"The moo frites had good fries, they were different in a good way. Very delicious fries try the sauces they are very unique. I highly recommend the Moo Frites! Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"The fries were crispy for just 2 seconds, after that it's just a whole lot of mushy potato. The cheese curd was not even melted and cold inside.. the girl cashier looks like she couldn't care less for her job."}
{"text":"This place is a must go if you're traveling to or live in Toronto. It's in the heart of Kensington Market..which is also a must tour. I am a fry addict! These fries are thick cut, crispy (because they're double fried) and full of fluffy potato goodness. I had the kimchi and japo frites. The Japo Frites were my favorite. Mayonnaise on fries is just meant to be. This place makes all of my mayo/ fries dreams come true. The Japo Frites have a wasabi mayo which needs to be bottled and sold in a store near me. They're also topped with seaweed flakes which really enhances the flavor. They have an option where you can get the fries deep fried in beef fat, which sounded amazing. Unfortunately they weren't doing it on the day I came. They also have a ton of dipping sauces to choose from. I had a hard time picking (because I'm indecisive lol) so I just tried the the curry ketchup and garlic mayo. They were both winners in my opinion."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was adamant on trying this place out and I didn't mind the idea myself. I was hoping it would be flavourful and wouldn't feel greasy - but it was exactly that.  I liked the cut and texture of the fries although they were also too fatty for my liking, but thought the sauces were VERY fatty and gross. I tried a Parmesan sauce and another one my friend got that I believe was called \"Andalouse\", and a garlic mayo. I felt full in a very gross way after, and I don't feel this way about all fried food! There is a way to make it that doesn't leave you feeling nearly sick after consumption. I didn't think the price was worth it either.   What I did like: the shape of the cones, the spot for the sauce, and the matching cone holes in the counter tops was very convenient."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this little fry joint.    The cone of fries is deceivingly generous, no matter what size.    I recommend beef fat.  Canola oil is so passé.    Samurai dip was totally addictive."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, they have a student special right now for $5 which is a pretty sweet deal for any specialty fries. I had the Kimchi fries which were really good and the Kimchi tasted so fresh, I think they make it in-house if I'm not mistaken. Large is definitely worth it cause the small is way to small. Even if you get regular fries and their garlic mayo it still hits the spot, its cool that the tables have a small hole in them to exactly fit their box size for their fries. When its busy the fries seem to taste better, I went one day during the week when it was empty and it wasn't as great as the last time. Customer service is usually pretty good, the cashier was being really nice and explaining the options to first-time customers.  If I'm in the area I would definitely stop by for a nice snack to keep me going through the day."}
{"text":"I love potatoes. I love it in all forms. Be it fries, waffle fries, mashed potatoes, potato chips, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes...you get the picture.  But pomme frites type potato fries are my absolute favorite. So I had to give this place a shot.   I had their regular Belgian fries and their curry ketchup sauce. It was a pretty solid. Def prefer this over poutine."}
{"text":"It's fries.  Going into it with this knowledge is helpful.  It's not reinventing anything.  It's not anything insanely innovative.  It is fries, and dips.  Nice fries.  Not the best you've ever had.  But good.  And dips.  They let you sample.  They are friendly, excited to see you.  The dips taste good, and compliment the fries.  It's a bit expensive, but it's nice to share with a friend.  I'd go back.  For fries."}
{"text":"caught staff rolling her eyes at me, other than that food is great and the place is clean"}
{"text":"Was here on a Wednesday evening. Ordered their japo fries which was just over $6.00 for a box. Loved every bit of it. That wasabi mayo and bits of seaweed were so delish! Hot fries, crispy outside. I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a great alternative to just a regular poutine! My favourite dish is the kimchi frites but the japo dish is also delicious. The price is reasonable and the portions are quite big!  I've been here 3 times and definitely will return in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great chunky large fries with a side of parmesan sauce...doesn't get better than that. Despite the long line, it went quickly. Can't wait to go back to try more of the sauces."}
{"text":"Never really understood the hype for any sort of 'frites' place. I mean they're just fries right? Well, these are some pretty damn good fries that can hit the spot for a snack almost anytime, so I sort of get it now. Was a bit overwhelmed by the number of sauces they offered, so decided to go for one of their specials, the War Frites. Was covered in peanut sauce, frite sauce(a sort of garlic mayo), and raw onions. Gotta say....really did hit the spot.  The fries are thick cut and fried to perfect, so they're crispy but not too overly greasy. Check.  Portion sizes? LARGE. They come in Small($4), Large($6), and Jumbo($8), but they should really come in Large, Larger, and PotatoMassacre, because even the smallest size was enough to share. The specialty fries(The War, Japo, and Kimchi), only come in Small($6) and Large($8). Might seem like a lot for potatoes, but for the amount you're getting, it's reasonable.  As for the War Frites, the frite sauce, mayo, and peanut sauce combination was a surprisingly good mix of savory and sweet, though it was a bit imbalanced for me. Too much peanut sauce and not enough frite sauce at the end. But, like their potatoes, they are generous with the amount of sauce as they layer it not only on top of your frites but also throughout the 'cone'."}
{"text":"If you love crispy fries, you'll love these.   Large was a good size as a full meal if you have an appetite. I was pretty stuffed. They fill the cone right up to the top, perhaps even too much, as I got my order and fries immediately fell on the floor. But I'm not complaining! Your cone of fries even comes with a little baby fork.   Unlike a few others, I didn't have an issue with greasy fries.   I had the garlic mayo sauce, which was exactly what I thought it would taste like. I sampled the spicy peanut, which is a warm sauce, and as much as I love peanut [butter] anything, I passed because it seemed a bit too hot and heavy for fries on a hot day.    The store itself is small with a narrow bench lining the side. I went at lunch on a Friday and there were people eating there, but it wasn't busy and there wasn't a line. It's not a bad place to sit as it's relatively quiet, but I would prefer to walk around Kensington.  I'm excited to go back to try the fries deep fried in beef fat (to see if it's worth the extra $1) and the different sauces."}
{"text":"Fries with dipping sauces in a nutshell.  There's  regular ketchup for the traditionalist.  Cut out holes in the counter top to hold your cone wrapping.  Door was shut so oil smell was strong.  Fries were crisp and a perfect snack size.  You'd want to devour every morsel!! Can't really get to the bottom of the cone wrapper so had to turn this over to shake it out."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviews that say this place is overrated.  You get a small scoop of Belgian fries with a bit dipping sauce. The concept is new and the paper container is innovative but I'm not sure if it's worth the hype."}
{"text":"Quick and easy for your poutine fix while in Kensington market. The regular size is a really big portion so I would share between two people. They offer the classic poutine and have \"fusion\" ones such as Kimchi, seaweed, chili cheese, etc. Not too much seating, so it's designed to take it on the go."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want fries and damn good ones at that. Moo Frites means business with thick-cut, crispy fries that are still soft on the inside! And with so many sauces to choose from, this really makes for a fun and different street food experience."}
{"text":"These fries are the best I've had in the city, hands down. They're crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside - and not too greasy which is a difficult feat to manage with fries! I had mine with the peanut sauce. My only complaint about this place was the tables - I'm short and I'm not a fan of bar stools so it would be nice if they had some tables. However I understand they're renovating so you never know!"}
{"text":"Gourmet fries located at the kensington market. The place is small, with a few window seatings available. Thick cut fries, with a crisp outside and soft inside.  We got the fries with their dip. What would really draw me back here would be their dips. They have a variety of dips flavour that is worth trying (each dip is about a dollar). Their dips are all unique, and able to cater to everyone's taste buds.  There was only one worker when we went and he was super friendly and patient with us (we had a hard time deciding what to get).  Definitely coming back to try their speciality fries!"}
{"text":"The fries were delicious, but I ordered the Japo frites and I must say that I am not a fan. The fries itself were delicious, but the mayo with the seaweed was too intense of a flavor. I'll try a different flavor next time."}
{"text":"Moo Frites is located on the north Side of Baldwin close to the intersection of Kensington and Baldwin in the heart of Kensington Market.  Moo Frites is a small place with enough seating for maybe 10 or so.  Because of the size expect to really only have wall or window side barstool type seating.  One thing you can't help but notice is the bars along the seating have holes in them pretty much shaped to hold your paper cone of frites after you get them.  This makes perfect sense since these nuclear hot golden potato sticks really have to settle for a bit before you can even touch them.    A typical regular order of frites will take about 4 to 5 minutes to make because they will be served to you hot.  Being double fried, the sticks themselves will probably stay hot all the way through your attempt to eat them if you don't give it at least 5 minutes to let them cool down and even then they're probably still going seem to be as hot as when they were first served.    They have a variety of specialty styles such as what one could consider Japanese, Mexican and good old poutine but the frites here are not just straight up fries.  Since it's all they sell the product better be top notch and good or a place wouldn't be able to hold their own considering their base offering is just that single item.  Having the single item (frites) however doesn't entirely make them one dimensional.  Having the slight variety of choices changes it up a bit but only so much.  You have to really love fries/frites to appreciate how well they're made at Moo.    If you can imagine thick cut dense potatoes softer on the inside but with a decent solid crunch on the outside.  These things do not bend, they break.  Being the thickness that they are they will hold that crunch wall as a shell while the inside are a differing texture but it's still the same thing but a package and a wrapper all in one.  Fried potatoes usually aren't as complex but they are here at Moo.  Adding another level off the original base such as making it a poutine or other style changes it up sure but I think I like the basic plain style just fine.  They're that good that they can live on their own without having the need to go all out.    The original Moo sauce is like a sort of sweet and smoother mayo, no definitely not Miracle Whip that stuff is nasty.  The sauce is a compliment and I admit I was using it to help cool down the hot sticks while eating them."}
{"text":"I love fries. Hands down I could eat them for almost every meal, so needless to say I was pretty excited to try Moo Frites.  The first thing I noticed was how STICKY the floors were ! I had to walk a block outside of the store before it didn't feel like my shoes were going to get stuck on the sidewalk.  It wasn't busy at 5 on a weekday (only about 4 other people) so we sat on the stools near the window. The  guy behind the counter was friendly and took our order. Unfortunately we both ended up getting the Kimchi Frites and I would've also liked to try another flavour.   The fries themselves were good: thick cut (personal fave). There was a decent amount of sauce and LOTS of Kimchi ! I got a small but to be honest I don't know how anyone could get a large because 3/4 of the way in I felt sick. It didn't help that the fries on the bottom were greasy. Oh and the forks are basically toothpicks, cute but very hard to eat with.   I really wanted to love this place and to be honest in the start it wasn't bad. But as I continued to eat it just went downhill. Hence the three stars. I would still recommend you to try it at least once and see where you stand.I might go back once more and try a regular frites with sauce to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I love the Kimchi fries, they are phenomenal. I ask for the Frite sauce on the side as well. This is a small hole-in-the-wall place where - if you go at the wrong/busy time - you might not find a place to sit. It can be cold if it's winter outside. Service is fast, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"So I can't recall if I had the frites cooked in beef fat the first time I was here... I want to say no. And then I want to say that I think the beef fat made my frites more salty (compared to my memory of the previous visit). So next time I will try without the beef fat again haha.  I love this place. It's great with friends or with a casual date. I've been here in both contexts. This time I sampled the spicy sriracha, thought it wasn't spicy and then went for the spicy mayo. I wish I had gone with the sriracha just because the salt from the fries and the spice from the mayo didn't combine as well as I wanted. My date had the Parmesan peppercorn sauce. I liked it, but I prefer my sauces to be sweet or spicy and it was more mild than I personally enjoy.  I will definitely be back, because I like this place a lot and there's always so many options (for sauces).. Gotta collect them all, ya know?  It's also budget friendly and filling for the amount you pay, always a bonus!"}
{"text":"I got a War Frites and their \"small\" was the perfect size and it was worth the price."}
{"text":"First visit lived up to the expectations. Kimchi fries were awesome. The kimchi was one of the best I've had, even compare to some of the Korean restaurants I've been to. Definitely coming again and trying out other varieties."}
{"text":"Wow kimchi fries... who woulda thunk eh? The sauce is what makes it great to be honest. The fries aren't oily and makes a very nicely sized lunch or snack.   Couldn't believe I didn't know about this little place until now. I will be back often."}
{"text":"I love Moo Frites. Need to get a cone of fries every time when visiting Kensington Market.   They serve thick cut fries that are shorter length. I like that they have several flavours of dips and toppings to choose from. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Really delicious fries. They taste fresh cut, although I didn't ask.   We got the Korean kimchi fries that came with kimchi, scallions, and a spicy kimchi mayo.   Decent amount of kimchi, mayo, and scallions.   I don't think the kimchi is made in house. Pretty sure it's the \"Chonga\" brand. The kimchi mayo is the perfect amount of spicy.  The fries are served in a cone and I wish that they layered the toppings, especially when these fries aren't exactly cheap. We ran out of sauce and fixings by the time we reached the bottom of the cone. Oh yea, the fries are served in a cone, which at first, seemed like an inconvenience. Then we realized that the holes in the table are for putting the cones into."}
{"text":"Came back again, of course. It was even better than I remembered it. Just wanted to point out that we got free poutine because some crazy guy, I guess, forgot to get his poutine and walked out so the shop keeper gave it to us. The poutine gravy was probably the most note worthy thing. You can seriously taste that beefy goodness. The overall poutine was understandably mushy and warm because it was just sitting there waiting for the guy but still the best poutine I've ever had (mainly due to that gravy)."}
{"text":"Considering all the great reviews I decided to come and try. I ordered the japo fries and yes they are thick cut. The fries are topped with seaweed flakes and wasabi mayo. However, the top layer of fries is literally soaked in sauce and the fries on the bottom is so dry. Don't get me wrong, I love fries but maybe this style is not for me."}
{"text":"I love anything deep fried, so obviously fries are one of my favourite foods. This place makes amazing thick-cut crisp on the outside and soft on the inside Belgian fries. I got one of their specials and a regular fry with two dipping sauces, all were made to order. They have a bunch of mayo-based dips, so make sure you share if you're planning on getting one of those because it does get a little heavy.   The wait was less than 10 minutes to get our food, but there were only 3 other patrons in the place at the time.   The restaurant itself has enough seating for about 10, with a bench for people waiting on their orders.   Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of fried foods!"}
{"text":"The fries here are so good I would bathe in them, if that was socially acceptable.  The Jap Frites are highly recommended."}
{"text":"A 4 stars.More inclined towards 3.5 though.  So here's my take on the famous Moo frites in the middle of the wonderful and my absolute favorite Kensington Market.  So here I ate not just their fries but also had the sauces and lemonade.And therefore my rating reflects my take on everything I tried.  The fries here are absolutely divine and if I was just to eat them solo I would give me 5 stars.They are perfectly thick cut and fried to perfection and salted just about right.The temperature they serve them at is perfect too-not to hot.  I tried 2 sauces and both were a ok.The spicy ketchup was very predictable and the garlic mayo lacked a garlicky kick which I would have liked.  The lemonade was so so bad seemed liked the kool-aid ones-maybe next time I will try the raspberry hibiscus lemonade.  Overall lines are long but they move fast and the ordered taking and picking is a quick process.It is a small place but they got ample seating wrapped all around the long shop.  Pricing is reasonable too and you can check the menu and pricing in one of my pics.Definitely a must try if you like fries.Maybe next time will try some different sauces."}
{"text":"I was drooling heavily just by looking at the photos taken at this place featuring their fries. And, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say it is worth taking a trip downtown for, though. I decided to get the War Frites and Kimchi Frites, with the War Frites being fried in Beef Fat.  I wouldn't recommend getting it fried in Beef Fat which is an extra dollar, because you can't really taste a difference or it's generally unnoticeable. I certainly didn't find a difference in the taste or texture at all, so it really wasn't worth the extra add on. The fries are pretty standard, I didn't find them creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside. It's similar to eating potato wedges in my opinion. Kimchi Frites was good, it's hard to not like potatoes drenched in sauce and kimchi. War Frites was probably my favourite though, but it did get kind of heavy after a while because of the peanut sauce LOL. I personally love peanut sauce and onions, so it was a complete winning combo for me. The sweetness and slight sting of onions with heavy peanut sauce....YUM. Only thing is that I wish the peanut sauce was sweeter! I think that peanut sauce tastes really good if it has a little sweetness to it, but that's just personal preference! It was a really nice touch that they also put sauce in the middle for both of my fries! I was pleasantly surprised when I finished the top of my fries to find that there was still sauce to distribute among my other fries, super logical! I was actually going to be disappointed that I had to eat plain fries but that's not the case with Moo Frites, they've got you covered! If you're not sure about a sauce, you can always ask for samples too which is great.   Overall, even though I'm not a huge fan of potatoes, I love Moo Frites! Their fries are pretty solid and I would probably go back for their War Frites. It's really messy actually to eat the fries, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Moo frites was good and filling. The price is normal food price and I got the kimchi fries. I got a regular size and it was pretty filling. The fries were thick cut and there was a good amount of everything!"}
{"text":"Very busy. $7 poutine was a great size but I regretted going for something so ordinary. Next time, I will try some of the funkier sauces and fries."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the frites from here. Took a bit of time to make them, but once we got them they were hot and fresh. Really thick cut, and a good texture to them. We got the regular size and it was filling for us to share with the samurai sauce which really added more flavour to the frites. Was kind of disappointed that they gave us sampling of the sauces using a little plastic stick, so kind of hard to taste them with the frites. Would be nice to see them try with pretzels or previous frites from a bigger order instead of wasting the plastic?  Definitely will be coming back here with more people to come. A great addition to Kensington Market."}
{"text":"As a lover of french fries i was ecstatic to see a place dedicated to just that. I was not however expecting to like poutine. To my suprise i am a huge fan. I got the regular size which was rather big i couldnt finish it and i had the help of my friend. I do wish they had one size smaller just because the gravy does get a bit overwhelming with time, but all in all I will be back to try the other creative flavors they've got going."}
{"text":"If you like fries and dipping sauce, this is the place.  We tried Joppie which we were told is the most popular flavor in Amsterdam and Jalapeno-lime.  Both were yummy.  Good quantity & quality!"}
{"text":"The Andalouse mayo here is the bomb! It's a tomato and chili pepper mayo which I would describe as a spicy, tangy sauce that tastes like thousand island but better. I also got to try the Wasabi mayo here and I found the wasabi taste to be too overwhelming although I'd definitely come back to try their Joppie (Dutch curry) mayo next time.  The fries are good and were well seasoned with generous salt and pepper but honestly nothing too special. The sauces are what makes this place stand out and they definitely are unique and delicious."}
{"text":"You know these are good when you couldn't stop eating them even though you were already pretty full   I didn't know the difference between frites & fries so I looked it up (thanks Google). Apparently the main differences are that frites are usually fried twice and in animal oil instead of vegetable oil  These thick-cut frites were hot & fresh since they were made upon ordering. Loved the texture - slightly crispy outside and so soft & fluffy inside!! The dipping sauce we got (garlic mayo) was really good with the fries, flavourful but not too heavy!  It was also such a brilliant idea to have holes on the table for you to place your cone of frites !! The container was pretty deep though so even with the help of the mini fork we couldn't get to the last piece of it at the bottom   I will definitely go back to check out their other flavours (esp the Japo Frites), they got so many many interesting options  & this place will satisfy your  cravings!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of thick cut fries then you have to come to Moo Frites.  I had their japo frites and enjoyed it to a moderate degree but which I had chosen something else. Their fries are obviously the main star of the show here. It's thick cut, not overly salty, and the inside has a fluffyiness to it. These are good fries! I suppose they could have been a tad more crisp but it was still good nonetheless. The japo frites featured tons of Nori flakes and sesame seeds with wasabi mayo. The flavours do work wonderfully but I also wish there could have been more wasabi mayo as the thick cut frites necessitate it, in addition to the dryness of the nori. There was only a thin layer of sauce at the bottom and the top of the container, which was engulfed and consumed by the nori.   They also have cutouts in the high bar tables where you can put your cones of fries in, ingenious!  I'm definitely curious about their sauces and will definitely be back to try them!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I love the Japo Fries. Love the Belgian-cut style fries, the Japanese mayo, nori and sesame seeds on top. I would add scallions, pepper, and ketchup on the side as well to make it taste even better. Overall, great place to get fries and poutine that stands out from other fries stands."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews both on Yelp and in the local press I decided it was time to give this place a try.  I ordered a small fries straight up with no sauces, toppings, etc. I wanted to judge the fries on their own merit, not hidden or diluted under overly spicy, salty, or sweet condiments.  Despite the 'high tech' fryers, oil and potato used to make the product, I found myself sadly disappointed. The outside of the fries were soggy, not crispy. The inside though was soft and fluffy. However the overall taste was bland with little flavour of 'potato'.   I really wanted to like this place. Sadly it didn't do it for me.  Service friendly, establishment clean."}
{"text":"Had the Japo frites which were delicious! The small size is plenty for a meal for one. The wasabi mayo was nice and creamy with the kick that wasabi provides. The shredded seaweed hits you hard but in a good way. I would say the toppings really made the dish - the fries were nothing special when eaten alone (If they were a little heavier on the wasabi mayo then the fries need not ever be eaten alone.) The service was fast and friendly. I would definitely recommend and return for the Japo frites!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here while she was visiting Toronto for a week. We both love our fries in general and are always on our own personal hunt for the best fries. These one most certainly top the list of the both of us. My sister got beef-fat fried and I got a normal fried fries. Both were superb. My sister (the biggest ketchup fanatic I know and normally won't touch anything but ketchup for dipping) loved their garlic mayo. I will go back again. Love it."}
{"text":"Probably the best fries I've had in Toronto. They are Belgian fries and taste great and you can pick from a bunch of different dips. They give you a big portion and the price isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"It is rumored that French fries received that name during WWI. At that time, American soldiers were introduced to the fried potatoes in Belgium, but because they thought they were situated in France (due to the fact that part of Belgium speaks French), the soldiers nicknamed these fried potatoes as French fries, instead of calling them fried potatoes. - the culturetrip.com  Watch this video if you want to know the back story of the owner and how he came up with the name of the store https://youtu.be/NQVSyX-hSCo  Small place with skinny bar tables and benches for those waiting for take out orders. Staff are friendly and eager to help you find something that suits your tastes.   Fries are made fresh after you order; they're thick cut and double fried. Now add 20 dipping sauces, all made by-hand, in house in small batches. How about toppings like chili, kimchi, or seaweed?  ORDERED: Kimchi fries - liked these better than the ones at Banh Mi Boys.   SAUCES TRIED: Andalusia (Tomato and chili pepper mayo) -  YUM! Joppie (Dutch Curry mayo) - pronounced \"yawp-ee\" YUM! Parmesan pepper - meh  Next time, I'm going to request that they cook up my fries OG style: in beef fat! Moo frites: a french fry lover's haven."}
{"text":"Won an instagram giveaway and got to choose try one of the frites here for free. Got the Kimchi frites - did not disappoint. Me and my boyfriend were in love with it!! Their sauces are delicious. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the large poutine thinking it would be large like the box. It was only half full and for over $10 that's a rip off. It was also covered in pepper. If you like pepper that might be okay but I'd prefer not to have it on a poutine like any other served in Canada. These guys are terrible, don't waste your time.  Rude service too."}
{"text":"I love the fries here because it is so fresh and crispy since they are constantly making new batches.    Service is always efficient and friendly. The owner seems to be really passionate about his shop and he enjoys interacting with customers. I think the service is great for a casual fast-food joint.   For the fries, I love having fries with mayonnaise. I've tried their poutine, kimchi, and japo versions. But I personally enjoy the fries without all the added stuff on top since it gets the fries soggy. I prefer ordering fries with the sauce on the side to dip it in.   There isn't much seating inside so don't be surprised if you have to get your fries and eat on the go."}
{"text":"Their fries are made to order which is very good.  We ordered the Japo. fries. Seaweed and wasabi mayo - something different. But $7.55 is kind of expensive, since they only put just enough seaweed and mayo to cover the top part. By the time we finished half of it, I have to buy an extra garlic mayo to finish the rest of the fries."}
{"text":"I loved this place! but I do wish it was a little bit more cheaper...   I had the Kimchi Fries. Personally, I love drenching my food with sauce, which I guess explains the reason why I liked it so much. Also, the kimchi actually tasted a lot like the authentic Korean kimchi (I am Korean lol)! I was really surprised about this because usually places like this don't serve the authentic type of kimchi."}
{"text":"Honestly, I felt a little bit disappointed about the frites. It was neither so delicious as the ad I saw everywhere, nor so authentic Belgian style frites as I tried before. I am a huge fan of frites, that's why my expectation is quite high. I tried the specials-Japo. The frites were deep-over fried, crispy outside, but no taste of soft inside, just empty and oily inside. They were quite generous on giving sauce. That's good."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back! Fries are thick and fresh with just the right amount of crisp and salt. I had ordered the kimchi frites which were absolutely amazing! Loads of actual kimchi with some garlic mayo on top. It was really delicious and i like that it was savory and yet you get the sour taste from the kimchi.  My boyfriend had the jap frites which had lots of seaweed and wasabi mayo. It had the initial flavoring of a sushi roll but then you'd be reminded it's a fun poutine.  I also tried the raspberry hibiscus tea lemonade which I found very refreshing. It was a bit sweet but I still really liked it.   I would come back for sure! There's not much seating (seats for 6) but there's a bit of bench room. Take it to go if you can :)"}
{"text":"Fries are meaty and light.    I got the tallow one time and we didn't seem to notice much of a difference in taste and texture.  It was more golden brown tho.  They need to get a poutine here and all would be good.  Love their fries.  Can't compare to anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not giving this place 5 stars is not an option, this place provides an amazing and unique snack you can't get anywhere else. Located right in the heart of Kensington Market, Moo Frites offers a bunch of different options which all involve french fries (Belgium Style) and delicious toppings. Today's trip supplied me with the War Frites, which were topped off with a peanut sauce and some other things I honestly didn't even pay attention too because I was too busy inhaling them into my stomach. This was my second trip to Moo Frites and it most certainly won't be my last!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place in Kensington Market, not to mention my favourite French fry place in the city.   A MUST try.   Belgian fries in a cone with a dip of your choice. Their house sauce is good, but it's the peanut dip (sorry tree-nut allergy friends) that will completely wow you.   The portion sizes are huge, so you're likely going to end up over ordering. A small is absolutely enough. On a date, pop for a medium. My date and I were ravenous and we ordered the big one and couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"As part of my Kensington Market food adventure, Moo Frites was on the list.  Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was no line.  Just one other customer inside already enjoying their fries.  My friend and I shared a small kimchi fries.  These are way better than Banh Mi Boy's kimchi fries.  Most of the credit goes to the actual fries at Moo Frites.  They are fresh and delicious!  Even the kimchi is pretty good too.  The small is actually pretty filling and I'm glad my friend and I shared one because I would've been too full.  I wouldn't have been able to fit in any more food for our food adventure!   Overall, I think this is a one time thing for me.  If I did come back, I'd definitely have to share again.  However, I do think this is a must try for anyone visiting Kensington Market."}
{"text":"My friend got the Japo Frites and I had the War Frites.   I think the Japo Frites were made with too much wasabi. When my wasabi-loving friend had to let the staff know how spicy it was, the man behind the counter looked surprised... Yikes. She had to put ketchup on it to finish it.  War Frites were fine for the first few bites, then the peanut sauce became overwhelming. I had to trash it as I couldn't bear to eat another bite.  The place itself is small and had a strange smell when I walked in. I considered eating somewhere else because of that alone... Should've went with gut feeling."}
{"text":"Delicious Belgian frites! I always make a point of stopping here when I'm in Kensington Market. I especially like their garlic and lemon aiolis as dips for the fries. I have also tried their war frites, which are very good - peanut sauce with a mayonnaise-type sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite poutine so far and way better than my first try at poutine in Windsor, Canada.  We ventured late at night in Kensington Market and found Moo Frites. They serve thick-cut fries with toppings inspired by different countries. We ordered the classic poutine and went with the regular size after a recommendation was given by fellow patrons. Ordering the regular size was a great suggestion because the portion was enough for the two of us.  The poutine was delicious. I'm normally not a fan of thick cut fries but these were crispy and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These fries were super sturdy too because they did not really get soggy from all the gravy that covered them. The curds were yummy too and they slightly melted from the heat of the fries and the gravy.  The service was very friendly and helpful wI would totally want to try their other flavors if I'm in the area again. I'm not quite sure where the line is drawn when it comes to calling something poutine that does not have traditional poutine toppings, but the Japanese poutine was so popular that it was sold out when we visited."}
{"text":"If you're only gonna cook one thing, you'd better get it right. Luckily, they get it right. The frites are chunky, crisp on the outside and pillowy in the inside. The sauces are tasty, but be warned, you'll need more than one serving of sauce for a large serving. Two servings were barely adequate and resulted in scraping up any smears of leftover sauce."}
{"text":"Nice to eat 'patatje oorlog' on vacation in Canada from the USA. Fries are OK, but they have 'satesaus' so that compensates for a lot. Good portions and I like the 'puntzak' as container with associated slots in the table to set them down in."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much about Belgian Fries over the years that I was really excited to try this place out.  It's a tiny little joint located in the heart of Kensington Market and as such, there isn't a lot of seating to be had. (It didn't help that when I arrived a large group of giggling teenagers, none of whom were eating anything, were occupying all but one of the stools.)  After perusing the lengthy menu, most of which is occupied by different dipping sauces, I elected to sample the War Frites, which come armed with Peanut & Frite Sauce, and chopped onions.  The fries arrived in a cone which can then be plopped into a cone-shaped hole in the long bar-like surface in the restaurant. The toppings in conjunction with one another were admittedly quite delicious and the chopped onions were also a nice touch.  The disappointing thing was the fries themselves. They were perfectly fine but no better or different than the fries I could get at any number of restaurants or poutine joints. Given that I possess no familiarity with authentic Belgian Fries, perhaps this is how they're meant to taste. But I have to assume/hope that the real thing would be a lot tastier than this."}
{"text":"TL:DR hella good thick cut fries 18 sauces huge portions really nice people   Really good thick cut fries. Something about it just tastes like they literally just made it from a potato and is not processed and weird. The employee are really good for helping indecisive lost customers (like me) chose from 18 different sauces. EIGHTEEN. FREAKING. SAUCES. I came an hour before close and some sauces were gone already (I wanted tartar but I got garlic mayo instead cuz they ran out). So this place must be popular. Also the portions are quite large. (The \"regular\" is like a full meal for me so that's always good) super satisfied"}
{"text":"My girls and I tried the mom Jap fries since it seemed so adventurous to try.  Not quite the fan of the wasabi-mayo sauce, it almost felt like I was eating warm sushi which I guess was the intent. I would definitely go back to try the chili cheese or nacho fries, the flavors I know I will definitely like!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Came here around 9:30pm with my fiance after having ate our way through Toronto that day. I had mentioned Kimichi Fries earlier in the day when we saw it on the menu in another restaurant and my fiance started yelping away and found this location. This place was small and cozy. Their seating is lined up against the wall and they only have stools. Their wall was decorated with various city maps representing the cities their fries were inspired after. They also had Buzzfeed and news articles written about them hung up on the wall. I found the Buzzfeed article about their \"smart\" fry holding table hilarious. Basically they have holes in their table which allow their cone fries to sit on the table which is genious!   We ordered their kimichi fries in the regular size. It came out after a few minutes wait. It was so good. I've seen people saying that it was too saucy but I'm all about the sauce. The more sauce the better! They were very generous with the portions and gave a lot of kimichi. Couple of other noteworthy things--the owner is super personable and it made the experience so much better and they have a machine they use to make their fries. I wasnt sure how it compares to the more traditional oil frying but the fries tasted good.   Overall, small location, good for late night/drunk/munchies food. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Kensington market, this place is quite small like any other food vendors around here. We walked in around 4pm on a Thursday night and we were the only customers there. A few others came in and out after. We ordered regular size kimchi fries for the two of us. The food came out pretty fast and the portions were large compared to the price. The fries had a savoury taste and were very crispy! Kimchi's sour taste blended in with mayo had a really interesting fusion flavour. I would recommend others to try this place as it is an easy take out food, not too pricy, and that tastes yum!!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is.  Went here and the fries were ok...not terrible.  Nothing special.  Actually, I may consider them slightly below your average Fish N Chip fries.  Plus the staff were not friendly and acted like they were doing you a favour by serving you.  Mooove on...nothing to see here."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of people rave about this place, so I decided to give it a try. I got the Japo frites, which had wasabi mayo, and seaweed. The fries were very crispy and had fantastic crunch, but the flavours didn't work for me. I don't think the food or portions are worth the price. Perhaps I'll come back to try another flavour, but I'm not quite sold yet."}
{"text":"narrow, red, black space for belgian-style frites in the vibrant kensington  drenched in spicy sauce, the kimchi fries pack flavour with some ample heat  just the fries themselves are full, hearty, and tasty crunchy skin, soft in  perfect portion size and worth my bucks!  i'll be back to try more items"}
{"text":"One of the best hidden secrets in Kensington market by far. This place specializes in fries & dip. They have a list of different variety of dip you can eat with your fries. I had tried the samurai (spicy) frites sauce and the yopie! And all of them are bomb. Very delicious.   I also chose that the fries to be made in beef fat, and it seriously makes a difference from the original fries. A lot of flavour and personally I find that it's very crispy. The thick cut style fries are best served with this dip. If your thinking they make like McDonald's style fries your gonna be blown away. Screw the fast food joints, this place you get a mountain filled of fries and a lot of sauce.   One thing I really like about this place besides there fries, is there cone style take out container. It's like buying an ice cream cone but fries instead. The design is really convenient and the guys made a small dip slot attached to the cone to make it easy to eat and dip your fries while you walk. It's a really smart and innovative idea compared to all the conventional styrofoam boxes. It's unique and cool.   Definitely a place to try out and go back to. For sure I'd go back to try more dips. Can't get tired of this place. Also they give away free pins too :D freebies ftw!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, but pricey! This place really does do fries well and the different sauces are a nice touch! The fries are hot, fresh and come with a huge portion of sauce. We got the parmesean peppercorn which kind was good, but nothing too special. Service was average at best.   If fries are your one true love, then this might be the place for you, but there are also other great fries in the city!"}
{"text":"An extravagant explosion of crunch, taste, freshness, and pleasure are all confined within the pridefully represented Kimichi Fries. Beware of the dangers of having to come back over and over for those. As a resident of the States, I will always make sure to come back and pick up some fries whenever Im back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Ahh..love love these thick cut Belgian fries! A regular-sized Japo fries ($6.95+tax) with seaweed flakes, Japanese wasabi mayo makes this place so unique compared to other poutine restaurants.  I didn't realize how many cool and delicious takeout restaurants were available in Kensington and I'm so glad I finally got a taste of it! They also offer fries in a paper cone with your choice of sauce. I just love how the fries are so crispy--I'd love to try their sweet potato fries and their kimchi fries next time!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while now. Moo frites specializes in thick cut fries with flavors from all across the world. Tbh I had trouble picking a flavour and first because there was so many good ones to chose from. I ended up selecting the japo frites. In the japo frites include the thick cut fries, wasabi mayo and seaweed. Really tasty and filling even at the smallest size. The only con about this spot is the wait time and the service. They were very understaffed so we had to wait for over 30 min for our order. Other than that my meal was very tasty."}
{"text":"Let's start off with saying I love fries... I can easily choose something off a menu because it comes with fries. I had some high expectations for a place that focuses on fries and I was a bit let down. If you love mayo... you will love this place. I do not love mayo. I ordered one of their specialty combinations... the name eludes me but it had kimchi in it. It was pretty good for the first couple of bites and then it was just sickening. The greasy fries combined with creamy mayo was just too much for me to handle."}
{"text":"i tried this a while back i thought the fries were average with the dipping sauce i had chipotle mayo i didnt think it was really a original idea. The fries were crispy which i liked but for the price i felt it wasn't really worth it. I felt i can make this at home for half of the price. Im surprised that this place is still open given the different varieties of fries food place are making nowadays like poutinis or smokes. I gave this place a chance and i was disappointed"}
{"text":"So so so so good.  Crispy fries, fast service, only wish they had a bit more space as it gets crowded very very quickly if you're waiting."}
{"text":"Fries are one of the things that I've loved as a child and still love just as much even now that I'm older. Every time I eat french fries, in order for it to be my favorite, it has to pass my fry evaluation which includes,: it's crispyness, size, flimsy level and whether or not it's crispy after being loaded with toppings and sauces. I ordered the Japa fries which is topped with Japanese mayo, wasabi mayo, sesame seeds and seaweed. The fries came in a cardboard/paper cone and I grabbed my first fry and took a bite, the flavours were not overwhelming whatsoever, I especially loved the wasabi mayo and seaweed which gave it the \"japanese cuisine\" type of flavour. So, my verdict: Crispy even with sauces? Check! Big enough to get a full bite and not combine 3 or 4 fries together and small enough to fit in my mouth? Check! Did the fry stand straight without flopping over? Check! It was a great experience and definitely one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something other than poutine, this is the place to go. Even if you are looking for poutine, they have that too. Like many other Americans, I love fries. I'm even more particular because I don't just eat any fry. I like my fries hand-cut, none of that frozen shit. And Moo Frites doesn't disappoint.  It is a bit of a small space, with about 5 stools and a bench for seating. We had to claim our spot on the bench, since there was a sudden mad rush of people after we ordered. I went with the large (to share) with a total of 3 sauces - Parmesan peppercorn mayo, Garlic mayo, and the Frite sauce. The Frite sauce was our favorite. They give you plenty of sauce, and we didn't even come close to finishing them.  There's really not much else to say. You stand in line, order, and then wait for your food. My only gripe is that there was only one employee, so there was a bit of a wait.  Overall: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 2/5"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Semi open kitchen. Limited seating space.   Ordered : Large / Kimchi Fries   They don't fry the fries the conventional way in a deep fryer, instead they use a different contraption. End result, perfectly cooked fries with hardly any oil residue and that oily after taste. Even after eating the large, which is alot of food, wasn't feeling nasty or bloated. The kimchi and sauces were on point, nothing skimpy here.   Overall would recommend Moo Frites and would go again to try their other flavors. Open late nights till 12:30 am on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Just ok for me.  I know they're fries, but they're super greasy!  The memorable fries that I have had weren't oily, so they must be doing something different - draining them for longer??  I shared a large (~$7) with a friend and it was quite a GENEROUS portion.  We had the Joppie sauce, some sort of mayo-ey curry.  It was just alright.  Sauce portion was generous as well.  It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't something that I'm going to run back and get either!  Again, I feel as though I've had better fries off a chip truck that weren't as greasy.  Although cardboard cone was convenient for a to-go, it was also messy - you tip the wrong way and fries will fall out.  Cashier, the one from Vancouver, was super friendly though!  So review does not in any way reflect customer service."}
{"text":"*The restaurant is tiny with only bar seats, this is more of a grab and go type place. *the side table has a small customized hole to place your cone style container of fries there, very convenient and thoughtful! *Their fries are made to order, they are also happy to let you sample!  *the Belgium fries have a thicker cut and are double fried. The result is deliciously crisp and hot on the outside, while fluffy on the inside.  -Kimchi Frites (Kimchi, Scallion, Spicy & Garlic Mayo) - $5.95 small:  Portion is very generous. The garlic mayo complemented and bring down the spiciness of the kimchi. The frites were perfectly fried, lightly salted and not too greasy at all. However I wish there was more layers of topping in between the fries, as there were only 2 layers and by the time I get to the bottom, there was no sauce nor topping left :(  -Frites w/ Spicy Sriracha Mayo - $4.25 small:  On my second visit I got the normal frites with a spicy Sriracha mayo dipping sauce. The spicy mayo was tangy and creamy, with a kick of spiciness from the Sriracha!  -Fries w/ Parmesan Peppercorn sauce - $4.25 small:  My friend got the parmesan peppercorn sauce and although it was a strange mix, the sauce was really good as well. The sauce isn't as spicy as the Sriracha sauce, the parmesan gives this creamy and cheesy taste, almost like eating a poutine (without the gravy)!"}
{"text":"japa fries - wasabi mayo and seaweed on top - is definitely OVERRATED. they also gave my order to a customer who ordered 5 min after me, which doubled my wait time. i also don't even see why there was a wait time when there was no customers to begin with.  when i asked how much longer, they all had a confused look on their face.. odd.  all in all, customer service was ridiculous for a fry wait and wasn't even busy. overall quality of fries sucked too, as there was sauce on top, but the bottom was just boring.  i would suggest eyeing your order as it comes out, as they are easily CONFUSED with orders. i don't see why they don't do a name system in place or sth."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about moo frites so I decided to give it a try.  Overall I was satisfied but not wow-ed.  It was drowned in sauces and felt like a poutine but not quite.  The fries were rather thick. But fried pretty nicely.  If I had one word to describe moo frites it would be satisfactory."}
{"text":"Literally the perfect fry. We were all very impressed! Golden, crispy, soft on the inside. Still tummy when cooled down. We will definitely go back. One request - it would be great if they made a Poutine! Please!"}
{"text":"FYI: These portions are HUGE. Like even their normal size is enough to fill up two people so unless you're starving or totally up for the challenge of finishing off a whole one by yourself, I recommend splitting it with someone.  Whoever created poutine is a culinary genius. God bless Canada.  PROS: Okay so for starters, I'm gonna put this out there and say that I've never had poutine before. In my 23 years of life, I've been missing this beautiful combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy without even knowing I needed it. I know. So sad. When I came up to Toronto on a business trip, obviously this was one of the things I needed to try before returning back to the States. And let me just say. Holy crap. My taste buds were LIVING. Moo Frites delivered a glorious pile (and I literally mean pile) of hot, thick cut fries that were beautifully seasoned completely smothered in cheese and gravy. The toppings even penetrated the deeper layers of the fries pile so every single bite we took had a bit of everything. They also had a rather diverse menu, with flavor combinations inspired by different countries, so there's definitely something there for everyone. But honestly, great flavors and generous portions, you seriously can't beat that.  CONS: Not much sitting room so I would recommend taking it to go (if you can) or coming at an awkward time so it's relatively empty."}
{"text":"Great place with good portions. Friendly staff. It reminds of when I was backpacking through Europe. Lots of mayo choices. The fries are really superb. I had a Canadian poutine with some maple mayo. A little too sweet but you can tell the fries are great quality.  No place to sit but that's okay. Perfect snack for wandering throughout the Market. Will return."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the poutine I got today... it was perfect! The beef fat gravy was not overly salty and had the a hint of black pepper mixed in. There was enough gravy so that no fry was left untouched and enough cheese curds so that you got some in every bite. Seriously- not sure if i got lucky or if the gravy:cheese curd:fry ratio is perfect everytime.   FYI I wouldn't recommend sitting in as the place is quite small and you can see a layer of fry smog hovering in the ceiling when you walk in."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but packs on big flavor! They have some more traditional poutine (not suuuuuper traditional though, I'd say - no smoked meats) and some more interesting ones. My friend and I got the original one and the Japanese one (pictured). We subbed the wasabi mayo for an aioli of their choice. He recommended the sriracha mayo and we loved that combo! Both were really, really good. You can't go to Toronto without stopping by here and walking around the area while you're at it. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I would try the poutine or the Belgian frites if it's your first time. Most flavorful fries in Toronto. Service is friendly and relatively quick. I've been here for 5 visits. I've also tried the Japanese and Korean fries. They were good but don't match up with the poutine in my opinion. I always come back for the poutine ."}
{"text":"Very unique, definitely worth the try.   We got the Kim chi fries. It was delicious.   There was only one person working; he prepared the food and took our order. Efficient!!   Definitely will go back and try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"I had read about this place a few times and kept reminding myself I needed to go. I visited Belgium last summer and ate way too many fries so I was really happy when I heard about this place. I finally went and it was great. I got the large size, which is a big portion, but definitely not too much for me. I also got the garlic mayo. It came to $6.75, without them being cooked in beef fat. I'll definitely have to try that next time, along with a different sauce. The owner was cooking them up (recognized him from The Star article) and he was really friendly."}
{"text":"Going out for fries can be extremely expensive! Don't know that I'd pay this much on a regular basis but what I had at Moo Frites was also very, very tasty.  I opted to get my fries cooked in beef fat, which was an additional $1...totally worth it. And after the guy working the counter allowed me to try samples of some of their dipping sauces I couldn't decide which one to get so I ended up getting four because they were all so delicious...$$$  Next time I'm in Kensington I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A small hole in the wall in Kensington Market.   We tried the new \"Special\" frites (curry ketchup, mayo, and chopped onions). The fries are thick cut and crispy. The curry ketchup needed more curry imo. I didn't realize that it was chopped RAW onions (I'm not a huge fan of raw onions). Unfortunately, we only had room to try one kind of frites so I can only rate them on this one.   Very limited seating and gets pretty busy and cramped at times."}
{"text":"I'm more of a skinny fries type of person, but Moo Frites' thick cut fries are deep fried really well and serves as a delicious treat yo self snack.  The fries comes in 2 sizes and I'd say the regular size is more than enough to share between 2 people.  I tried the kimchi fries, a twist on the classic Belgium fries, which is their top seller. The kimchi topped with garlic mayo was great, but very heavy so expect a food coma shortly after.  It's mostly bar style and standing kind of set up, with a bench and 2 stools by the window. So, take advantage of a sunny day when you can take the fries to go and walk around Kensington market. That being said, they have holes on the bars, which serve as holders for your fries cone. Genius!"}
{"text":"This place just opened last week.  They cook the frites to order and it takes a second but it's worth it.  The taste and texture is perfect.  I've had fries in Amsterdam, these were as good as those.  Top three frites experience. New York, Amsterdam, and now Toronto."}
{"text":"I tried the Japo, Kimchi and War Frites. They were all very unique and tasty. The War Frites with peanut sauce and onions was a curious combo but proved to be an amazing surprise. Who knew!! The same goes for the Japo. The wasabi mayo really makes the order shine. Kimchi fries didnt really do it for me.  I had one order of the fries fried in beef fat and another in regular oil, and I didn't notice the difference in flavour.  I give props to the owner for layering the sauce!!!  The owner was nice enough to let me sample each sauce on a sample stick since the place was not busy (it was 11:30am on a weekday).  There were a few pleasant surprises and each flavor actually tasted like its supposed to.  The fries are thick cut and golden brown. Its a small walk in place, so dont plan to come in with a large group and dont expect to sit and stay too long.  I recommend this place and Ill be back.  Ps you can buy three take away  lil containers of their gourmet sauces for $3.00 total.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Had the war frites,  yesterday afternoon, I was excited and I've gotta say they were kind of a let down.  I got their special for $5.50 with a coke.  The problem is they didn't put enough onions in my opinion and the frite sauce tasted like plain old mayo. The peanut sauce seemed old, and a bit on the burnt side not the greatest. Now the fries themselves were actually really good.  Now the Asian guy behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful,  the other dude just didn't really care, and that's fine.  I think they have a good idea but can do better with execution.   I would recommend some new flavors,  like a indian masala one, or cool east african,  or even a Mexican or Jerk flavour.    Also portion isn't too big but reasonable at that price point."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for awhile now . I'm so glad I got to check this place out my during my first visit to Toronto . I ordered the kimchi fries which were their best selling item as well as a small order fries with a total of five dipping sauces . The total came out to be about $16 Canadian .  The kimchi was a tasty but also a bit much like you wouldn't want to finish the whole thing . Think sour beer . Tasty but you don't want to finish a whole six pack .   The curry ketchup was not as good as some places o frequent back home in LA like wuestkuche for example .   However I really really liked the Dutch curry mayo !   The rest of the sauces were a bit lackluster .  I'd come back for a small with the Dutch mayo and also to try the Tunisian hot chili oil that they always seem to be out of .  Oh and I also had a bite of someone's potoutine which was alright . Better than smokes but not as good as somecspots in Quebec .  The secret to great pouting  is fresh cheese curds perfectly cooked fries and not too salty gravy .   This place only had one of the three qualifications.   Check it out ."}
{"text":"This places serves Belgian-style fries, which are twice fried to give extra crispiness on the outside while keeping the inside tender like Johnny Depp. It's served in a cone with a side of dipping sauce (in this case, chipotle mayo). The fries were good, but not fantastic as they were a little under seasoned. The dipping sauce wasn't anything special neither and could have been straight from the grocery store for all I know. Would come back if someone else was paying.  Rating: 2 Pirates of the Caribbean sequels out of 5"}
{"text":"Purpose of visit: Food Adventure Date  Price: pretty cheap in my opinion. After tax the total came up to $10.73.  We ordered: Small Belgian Frites ($4.25) + cooked in beef fat ($1.00) + 1 coke ($1.25) + 3 extra sauce ($3.00) - garlic mayo (average), wasabi mayo (bf liked), chipotle mayo (i liked), gochujang tartar (didn't like)  The fries were thick cut and not really thaat crispy. It tasted very dry. I don't know whether they really cooked it in beef fat or not, but we couldn't tell the difference. Either the Belgian Frites was a bad choice (maybe we should've ordered one of their special fries?) or it just didn't hit the spot. It's good, but nothing special. I wouldn't say it's the best in Toronto.     Now the question is - how would the Japo Frites here compare to uptown Shiso Tree's Nori fries and Okonomiyaki fries? -wink- (Now those fries made me go damnnn. And their homemade tartar sauce?! I'm sorry but it's waaay better than any of the sauce I tried here!)   I shall return one day to try their Japo frites!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place while in Toronto for the weekend, The fries were great and so were the flavors. The fries were cooked quickly! Definitely a place to stop by and grab fries for the go"}
{"text":"Hoooo boy, when my SIL suggested this place and exclaimed \"you HAVE to try it!\", she meant \"you HAVE to try it ASAP\". I'm not a natural fries lover (don't send the mob) but this place definitely gave a few good options.  Located right in the middle of the busy Kensington Market, there's only a few spots to sit in the venue - along the side where a long counter runs, or the 1 table at the front facing out to the street. I tried the Japo Frites, which was covered in seaweed, wasabi mayo and sesame, which will be HIGHLY recommended choice! Also tried the War Frite, which had raw onions and peanut sauce - a confusing blend, I must say. The fries themselves are fresh, but I think alone, they wouldn't be anything special.   Great snack! The small size is about $5 and large is about $7."}
{"text":"Waited for a long time to try this place! I had a regular with the pepper pares an and all I can say is Yummy! Fries were fresh not oily. My partner had the poutinery and was tasty good! I know I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Good Friday and at that time there was only one person in the entire store. I ordered the regular fries and a choice of sauce and it tasted awful. It tasted bland and irregular, as if it was processed. I would not come back again. I came here because of reviews and I had belgian styled fries before so I thought it may taste the same. It might just be because I went on a bad day."}
{"text":"I got an order for pick up by ordering with yelping messaging. Ambrose was very helpful and clear with his instructions with how to pick up the fries and what to do after pick up. They supplied is with containers of oil to add to the fries before reheating. I appreciate the service they provided. We ordered a few orders of just the fries so it wouldn't get soggy. They were delicious and we paid a bit extra for some extra dipping sauces which they packaged and prepared everything in advance to make it convenient and easy to just pay and pick up. Needless to say, it was a hit at the potluck. And I am one satisfied customer.   Ive also tried their fries here before the one with the Wasabi mayo, so good. You have to try that one!"}
{"text":"I planned on coming here for quite some time. I decided to get their japo fries but I didn't know that the wasabi mayo they used was not mild so I ended up tearing up at almost every bite haha. I would give it 3 stars for the toppings since I cannot handle wasabi well. But wow the fryers(?) they used were something I have never seen before. They told me that my order will be ready in 3:30 minutes and I looked at the timer on the oven and it said 3 minutes, which was pretty neat. The fries itself were amazing, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Never had fries like these before, will be coming back to try their other signatures though."}
{"text":"Very good fries, very cool counter! The only alteration I'd have made is thinner fries but man oh man were they good.   I went with my mom so we mixed the order up a bit. I got oil fried with parmesan peppercorn, she got beef fat fried with the garlic mayo, and we got an extra peanut sauce.  The oil fried were like high quality normal fries and the beef fat fried was out of this world... as a fan of beef fat fried things (yorkshire pudding 4 lyfe).   The Garlic Mayo was, obviously, perfectly amazing, very hard mixture to mess up.   The Parmesan Peppercorn was surprisingly successful. I didn't really know what to expect but it was a mayo based mixture of the ingredients and came together fabulously. I don't mind at all but some may be put off by the fact that it isn't smooth.   The Peanut was very true to its namesake and wasn't sweet like some places make it, but it wasn't possible to dip in to so I had to spread it with a fork, and it was a strange flavour with both of the fries. I've actually brought most of the peanut home with me and there's a chicken breast in my freezer with its name on it."}
{"text":"My young nephew & I really enjoyed the fries here. Crispy outside, fluffy inside, no hint of dryness. I went with the regular cone with frite sauce and the boy dug into the poutine. He said it was one of the best poutines he's had and coming from the cheese lands of the Quinté area the boy knows his curd. I also had the hibiscus black tea lemonade and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"They have these godly fry machines that dispense fries when they're perfectly cooked. I tried the Japo and the Kimchi fries and although I don't like Kimchi that much, I was leaning towards that one. The Japo fries have a kick to the wasabi mayo and it reminds me of eating sushi. They could be a little on the dry side compared to the Kimchi fries which were dripping with juices. I like that they had two layers of toppings for the large fries, because I was worried we wouldn't have enough for the bottom fries. Will definitely be back to try some of the sauces."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Kensington Market I feel the need to get fries at Mood Frites. It's not just fries its so much more than that. They have a few special items. They are fries with toppings they have already planned out. Then you also have the option of getting fries with whichever ones of many sauces you'd like. My favorite so far is the war fries. They are fries with peanut sauce, fries sauce and onions. Its SO GOOD. The fries are thick cut and cooked to perfection. They definitely know what they're doing here."}
{"text":"The fries are a little saltier than usual but I LOVE their chipotle sauce and their regular mayo. I ordered these fries as delivery and the fries came very warm. They use good quality containers to keep the heat inside. The fries are thick cut so if you don't like that this isn't the place for you. I also like taking delivery from this place so i can keep the dipping sauces for later as well. Delivery wasn't necessarily fast but overall I'm happy with the experience!"}
{"text":"Came across this place while exploring Kensington Market and was glad I went in! The fries were very tasty, and I had it with frites sauce and chipotle ketchup. Both were really good! I definitely would come back to try other sauces if I was in the area and wanted a quick snack. However, I wouldn't make the trip down to Kensington just for these fries."}
{"text":"Belgian frites my arse.  I have been to Belgian and the frites Moos sells are okay but do not compare with Belgian. Better then NY Fires but uneventful. Had the spicy ketchup and it was blah. Tasted like bad hot sauce added to the ketchup. Also the guy frying the frites should not eat pizza behind the counter while serving food, big no no."}
{"text":"My friend &  I got the Belgian Fries . My friend got them with joppie sauce, I got them with Andalouse . The fries are the best I have had in Toronto .. They have  a very good crunch to them, taste fresh, and are soft   inside. The table was quite interesting with holes to put out fry cones  while we  sit down and eat.  I was a bit disappointed that  the option for the  1 $  extra  to Beef Fat Fries was not available. I had read about it in a blog to article (http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/moo-frites-toronto/)  and was hoping to have some of that.  I will still  be back to enjoy some  fries with other friends  since i enjoyed the unique experience of eating the fries from the table as well as eating the fries.  :)"}
{"text":"Finally checked out this place. I've passed by it so many times but never got to try it.  Just ordered a regular moo frites with some sauce. I live how the fries are still crispy and crunchy even though it's thick.    The people there are nice too and love their curry ketchup dip.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I was coerced into trying the Japo frites here (I'm more of a simple poutine or kimchi fries girl, myself!) and they were just beyond. The flavors- wasabi, sweet mayo, seaweed, and toasted sesame seeds- worked surprisingly well on fries. On a cold March day, some moo frites are definitely in order. There's a reason people wait for 10-15 minutes for a plate of fries. Will be back next time I'm in Kensington!"}
{"text":"Located in a small shop on Baldwin Street the place is long and narrow with the kitchen and counter in the back. Along the long wall just inside the door runs a small counter for anyone wanting to eat inside. Behind the counter in the back, hanging from the ceiling is a menu split into two sections, one detailing the french fry options with the other offering a selection of possible sauces and dips. Everything is styled in that popular hipster manner emphasizing funky fonts and style.   The thick cut fries which are more Canadian than Belgian in style, are served in a cone that has a smaller cone on top for the sauces or dips. While lots of places in Toronto have tried to serve Belgian fries, over the years we only found one place that made fries in the Belgian manner. Years ago a fish and chip place on Augusta called Somethin's Fishy served the best Belgian fries we ever had. They were thin, crispy and dressed with a mixture of parsley, salt and garlic. Sadly, the place didn't last to young after the woman who ran it sold it to the guy who opened Fresco's.   One dip comes with every size of fries. We opted for the curry ketchup, hoping for the curry sauce we fell in love with while in Amsterdam, but found the curry ketchup instead a tomato based ketchup with a hint of curry. While the sauce was a little disappointing the fries were delicious and everything one wants in french fries, crisp, browned and yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing friendly people. Fries - crispy outside, soft inside. Exactly what I was wishing for when I want some good fries that is actually good with sauce. Not soggy and oily. Thumbs double up"}
{"text":"Tasty fries, but surprisingly expensive. I guess when all you do is french fries you have to charge over $5 for a small order.   I got the Japo frites which were good, but I'd probably try a different order if I returned."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I had to come check this place out. When I came in, they were not busy at the time so I got to order quickly.  The place has only bar seating so you should have a place to go to in case there aren't any seats left.  There were so many options to choose from. Thankfully they had indicators of which are spicy and/or a favorite. It made my life a lot easier. I got the Kimchi Regular sized Frites and Samurai Sauce on the side.  The frites were hot and crispy! It makes my mouth water just writing this review. I wish I had fried in beef fat to get that extra flavor but I was pretty full from a meal before. I shared the regular with another person and we could not finish! I would come here again and try everything else they have and that Samurai sauce again. This is definitely one of those guilty pleasure food joints."}
{"text":"It's fall! It's finally fall! Toronto in autumn is full of lots of lovable things. Hipsters in their best hats and scarves pounding pumpkin spice lattes are great and all, but my jam in fall is hitting up Kensington.   The air is crisp, the produce is perfect for Thanksgiving and the vintage shops have your Halloween goods on lock. Sometimes, though, you need a hugely caloric treat to go with your perfect fall outing and (elastic waisted) outfit, and that's where Moo Frites comes in. They have incredible fries, so many sauce toppings and they do poutine right. Salty gravy, plump curds and good prices.   They can get slammed. They can run out of things. But they're lovely and their fries are legit. If you want to be like me, and I think I have great taste in snacks, grab to go and walk to that little park on Augusta."}
{"text":"The classic poutine was great and provided quickly the only thing that I would say was wrong with the place was that it lacked space to sit. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot for a quick snack to share with your party. The owner Ambrose is extremely nice and very helpful to tourists. What a handsome lovely man! Kimchi fries were bomb af and definitely the most appealing on the menu. Second would be the Japo fries."}
{"text":"Very tasty and fresh fries, and not too salty. Variety of sauces to choose from. The fries holder also has a little pocket for sauces---smart design."}
{"text":"This place will hit the spot if you're looking for a simple snack/meal of fries. Thick cut with a nice hearty texture, the fries stand on their own. Paired with a sauce (I got the simple mayo sauce) makes them even better."}
