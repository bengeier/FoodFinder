{"text":"After desperately searching for good pho and reading these reviews, I thought I'd give this little place a try.  Staff was awesome but the pho and spring rolls...not so much.  I always order the rare beef pho wherever I go. I'm not a big fan of fatty beef but I had to order the one with the fatty brisket to get my rare beef.  Broth was different than I've had before and pretty good - had a nutmeg like taste to it.  Little disappointed there were no basil leaves to add though.  The spring rolls were meh and the shrimp salad rolls were empty - three shrimp, some noodles and a sprig of lettuce (I mean sprig too).  All in all, wasn't horrible, just meh."}
{"text":"The broth was delicious but I was a little disappointed in the way the noodles clumped together. A suggestion would be adding more basil in the salad rolls (as there was none) and providing it with the bean sprouts. Service was friendly, and the atmosphere was very ambient and clean."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and picked up to-go often as well. Good quality food and extremely friendly staff, although service can be slow when the restaurant is busy. Recommended"}
{"text":"First time walking in, the restaurant was fairly busy mainly 2 person per table. We noticed they were cleaning table and we requested to sit at the booth, while we were waiting behind us 3 individuals walked... After standing there for good minute we were redirected to a table and the booth was given to the three people behind us... Not first best impression... First thing I noticed when I walked in was the baby chairs... Considering how small the restaurant is it's not ideal place to bring children... And my luck there was child screaming two tables down... The decor looks Greek and there is 80s porno jazz music playing in the background little weird... The food finally came took some time... Sadly for the price the food was NOT worth it... They charge 3-4 dollars more than your average Vietnamese place but it's not worth it... I ordered number 16 chicken noodle pho, the noodle to meat portion is terrible (maybe 3-4 small piece of chicken) the broth wasn't bad tasted good but not worth the price. So overall didn't like it... Screaming kids... Bad service... And overpriced dishes..."}
{"text":"Mimosa is your standard Vietnamese restaurant, offering up the usual fare. The food is good, nothing out of the ordinary, but good. The reason I enjoy Mimosa so much is because of the owner, such a nice a guy. Always friendly, always has a smile, and he will talk forever about Vietnam if you have been there. Compared to Shawnessy Vietnamese a couple of blocks away, with crappy service, why wouldn't you always choose Mimosa?"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The food is amazing especially the pho and rice. The atmosphere is really cozy and very active. The staff is friendly and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food an service is great locally owned very good atmosphere in the restaurant been coming here for five years"}
{"text":"Nice owner, Food has been good and bad. Mostly just bland and lacking flavour."}
{"text":"First time going. The place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday night! Ordered and the food came right away. I ordered Satey soup and it was way too spicy so sent it back. Waiter was not pleased that I was sending it back. Received another bowl and it was better but not as good as other places. Wife had noodles and beef which she said was \"ok\". Will give this place a second chance and order other dishes. Owner was nice but food so so."}
{"text":"My favorite part of eating here is the service and he friendly manager / owner.  The food comes next as we ordered the bun thit nuong which is the rice vermicelli dish with the accompanying herbs and fish sauce.  The fish sauce is sweet and perfectly balanced.  A sure sign of authenticity.  

The pho was very good. I enjoyed the broth and meats but a bit small compared to US serving sizes.  


The satay and grilled meats are very good.  I wold definitely go back."}
{"text":"Slow service. We were the only customers at the time and yet it took more than 30 minutes for the food to come out. Not impressed with the food either. I am definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I had the  beef satay pho soup. The broth was lacking any flavour. There was no spice to it either. The beef tasted off as well."}
{"text":"Mmmm Vietnamese! is my first thought when I was thinking about what to write about my recent visit at Mimosa.

What a cute little place this is! When we walked in to Mimosa we were promptly greeted by a smiling face. I found the interior to be comfortable and cozy.

We ordered a round of Tsign tao's and had deep fried wontons and pork salad rolls to start. I normally like to have shrimp and pork in my salad rolls but since there was a \"choose one\" option we went with pork. The apps arrived very quickly and that pleased me because I was super hungry! The flavour of the wontons was great, I would have liked to have a dipping sauce come with them, but still good with some hot sauce. 

We spilt a combo with BBQ shrimp, beef and chicken on rice vermicelli. It was full of flavour and I enjoyed every bit of it! (with added hot sauce of course)

I will come back to get my vermicelli fix or to try other items on the menu... Perhaps both!"}
{"text":"Best noodle soup ever! the broth is amazing. and the lemongrass beef bun is so good. tender NOT fatty beef. Love the owners and have been going here for 15+ years. not the best place to \"eat-in\" because its a little dark in there, but very quiet so you might like that.  I Love the food!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Always on time and hot for pickup. Ordering online is simple and you get 20% off your first online order!!! Staff is always so pleasant and happy to see the customer. Simply my favorite take out in the area. Can't go wrong here folks!"}
{"text":"To start their spring rolls are not the best. They are made with rice paper so they are different then what you would typically be expecting. 
There soup is not spicy at all especially for a saut√© soup when you are expecting a lot of spice. For some this is good if you don't like spice but for those who enjoy spice and are expecting spice- this is not good. 
As well, this is completely my fault so I take full responsibility for it but i think it is a little weird. I ordered number 28A which I thought said Grilled Shrimp on rice vermicelli. When the order arrived (as we got take out and of course did;t look until we got home) I opened mine and it looked like I got chicken on rice vermecceli which I thought was fine because I still like chicken. Well I took a bite and it was most definitely NOT chicken. I revoked at the menu and it turns out it was GROUND shrimp on rice vermicelli not GRILLED shrimp on rice vermicelli so I still ate it and it wasn't awful but ground shrimp is just weird to me!"}
{"text":"Love love their soup  I like places like this the way they made their soup odd but great! I've never seen or tried a pho like this place makes it"}
{"text":"Overpriced bad food. I would avoid this place at all costs. My daughter after eating from this place got \"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\" (Google it) where her lips got swollen. According to the syndrome symptoms, this can be caused by high MSG content in food. You have been warned.

As far as the ambience goes, the restaurant is dark with old style decor. Christmas lights adorn some of the fake trees in the middle of June. Just overall bad taste in decor which shouts \"I maybe should leave now\" as soon as you walk in.

The owner is friendly but maybe to compensate for every thing else which was plain bad."}
{"text":"I can't say I would return to the restaurant. I kept on seeing it and always put off going there. But I decided I should try it out since we were having a lazy evening as we didn't want to cook that night. 

We were seated quickly. But when we sat down, the tables smelled of an old rag that had been used a couple days in a row. If the restaurant is reading this: you need to bleach the rags in between uses. I was immediately worried about how sanitary my dishes and cutlery would be. Of course, I looked at my drinking glass and it had old lipstick/lip chap on it. It got replaced immediately. But it already proved the red flag I had at first instinct.

The decor was just plain bad. Even the booth seat I sat in had a permanent butt indentation. 

The food was just alright (pho, vermicelli plate).  I've had better Vietnamese food overall. 

The staff were friendly. It seemed like they were getting a lot of phone calls for take-out orders."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little Vietnamese place tucked away in the sprawling Shawnessy shopping complex. It is no-frills, no-fuss Vietnamese food with lots of flavor and great service. Being close to home, it also makes for a great take-away place if we aren't in the mood to actually go out."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices.  Very friendly atmosphere and decor.  Has a great owner who makes you feel right at home.  Their pho is excellent as are their vermicelli bowls. Overall, a great neighborhood vietnamese restaurant."}
