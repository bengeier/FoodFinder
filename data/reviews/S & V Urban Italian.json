{"text":"This place is right next to my work, and I have ordered to go from here a few times and that's always great! We have sat in a few times as well, the last time, Meghan was our server and she was great! She made sure we were happy and checked on us a good amount of times. The food was great, will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment yesterday for dinner with my girlfriend and were quickly greeted and taken to our table where our server immediately introduced herself and brought us iced cold water as we decided over our drinks of which we chose a glass of red wine and a dirty martini. These two drinks were brought out in just minutes and the martini was absolutely on key. The bartender was definitely experienced in handling the crowd and efficiently making everyone's drinks. We ordered the smoked salmon tower and the calamari which we both agreed were delicious. We ordered our dinner which was the fruitti di mare and pesci e gamberetti with salmon. This dish was incredible. They both were!! I would absolutely without a doubt go back and take friends with me as well as highly recommended this restaurant to friends and family. This is one of my new restaurants!!"}
{"text":"The best Caesar salad around. The eggplant rollatini is always perfect. However, we were disappointed in the taste of the veal in the saltimboca. The linguini in that dish should have been hotter.
Overall, the rest of what we ordered was good."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a couple of years now when I am in town and have always enjoyed the food.  Ate there again tonight with my Mom and both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  I had the braised oxtail and polenta special, which was great, and Mom had the chicken Marsala.  She thought it was one of the best she's ever had.  We also split the spinach salad, big portion, and were pleasantly surprised to see the big rounds of pancetta in the salad.  Definitely a must if you like spinach salad.  
Atmosphere can be a bit noisy, but not bad tonight being a Monday."}
{"text":"We are HUGE fans and proponents of S&V! Great food, great service, and a huge hit with our clients! 

Our 2nd annual Holiday Happy Hour hosted at S&V, and several of our clients had nothing short of rave reviews about the location, service, food/wine selection & taste! Just like S&V, nothing means more to us than our clients happiness and the services we provide. 

For several months I worked alongside S&V's GM, Sheena. She was easy to contact, extremely responsive, and so accommodating. She was absolutely instrumental in the overall success of the event, along with servers, Christin & Sara. I had a handful of clients pull me aside to comment on how attentive and sweet both servers were. 

There is no doubt in my mind that we will continue our professional relationship with S&V, and continue to host our HHH event there."}
{"text":"We have been thoroughly impressed with this restaurant for a while. We had a birthday party with a group of 18 people last week. Sheena was amazing to work with...from getting us set up ahead of time and The night of the event, everything was perfect! 
Everyone loved the food and it was timed perfectly without feeling rushed. Definitely check this place out and we especially love the Bolognese!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks my world!!!! The servers are super friendly and the food is fantastic. I come here about 2 times a week and am extremely satisfied every time. They have a great happy hour too! Denise and Maggie are the best!"}
{"text":"Been coming here many times in the last couple of years, the atmosphere is great and the food is always delicious. 
The service is great. My favorite place for Italian food."}
{"text":"Incredible place. I have been here twice and both times have been completely impressed.  Order the pasta special and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went out to celebrate a business deal and the menu fit the bill. The wait staff was amazing too! The hostess even had readers as we forgot to bring ours in the excitement!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch using the Yelp app and loved the food.  They served many gluten-free options.  I had the eggplant something (eggplant rolled around cheese with sauce on top)....delicious!  My husband had the mushroom risotto with lots and lots of wonderful mushrooms.  We can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love S and V and visit as often as I can!  We had a birthday get together for what turned out to be 7 women. They have the best Happy Hour, not just for their drinks made by their great bartender, Danny, but the food is outstanding!  I always order the eggplant rollatini, the best I've ever had!  The sausage and peppers, calamari and the bruschetta are always perfect.  It's a great meeting place with a large open bar area and a lot of fun people.  The staff is great and the Manager (Sheena), not only accommodated the increase of diners at our table, but also visited our table several times, to introduce herself and make sure we were enjoying our evening.  We topped of the evening with the best chocolate mousse we had ever tasted, or course with a birthday candle.  (all of the guests sang, too)  Can't wait to go back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience. I have gone here several times. They catered and delivered for a funeral and it was still just as good as if I had gone there. I want to thank them for being on time and the food being fresh. The service was great as usual. I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is incredible! I met my girlfriend here for happy hour and it was amazing. The HH wine is great and only $5 a glass. I really think this bruschetta is much better than Postino. Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This was my second time as I have been there with my coworkers before and had a great customer service. So, me and my husband decided to take my friend and her husband out for dinner. We were welcomed as soon as we entered the door by 2 wonderful girls and we sat down right away to the patio (our request). The server came in within 2 minutes, he was very polite and thoughtful that even asked us if we wanted heat lamp and accommodated us right away. We ordered our drinks and some appetizers (Grilled Artichokes & Bruchetta- Spicy Salami, Pear & Brie, Date & goat cheese, Salmon), which came out 25 minutes later, the server apologized that our appetizer went to a different table by mistake. Grilled Artichoke was great with the pesto aioli. Salmon Bruchetta had a very fishy taste to it, pear and brie was nice as not too sweet, Date & goat cheese was very sweet- very similar to eating a jam on a toast, Spicy Salami was my favorite. Our server helped us pick our menu for the dinner. I ordered Seafood Risotto (as recommended by the server) and my husband had ordered Ciopinno. Our friends ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and Beef Chianti. Let me just say this! The seafood Risotto was so delicious and flavorful and plate looked amazing and I cannot wait to have it in my mouth again. The Ciopinno sucked, my husband was looking forward to having it since he has had it good at King's Fish house. It was very bland, if it could have the sauce I had with my Risotto, it can be a hit! Fettucine Alfredo was okay, my friend liked it but it was not out of this world. Beef Chianti dish (sorry! I do not remember the whole name of the dish, it was on their special that day), was very flavorful, meat was nice and tender but it could not beat my Risotto. Overall, we had a good time enjoying the dishes. I am hoping the other dishes would be as wonderful as my Risotto. Taking 1 star off with the request of my husband who was very bummed about his dish."}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently with friends. I came here last night and the food was great! However the service was AWFUL! I don't know if I will be back here because of how horrid this service was. Water was refilled constantly but the waiter was so slow with everything. Slow with coming back to take my drink order. She was slow to come take an appetizer order. She was slow to put in entrees. She was slow for multiple things. It took her 45 min after dinner to bring our check. I'm disappointed because I have never experienced this at this restaurant before. The place wasn't even busy for the service to be this awful. I hope I can find a different location soon because I love the food but need better service."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and the food is really good - have had the chicken parm, chicken and veal piccata, gnocchi, rotini bolognese, mussels and meatballs. All delicious. And so is their homemade bread. 

My only complaint is the cleanliness. Silverware wasn't that clean, nor was the table. Got a wine glass with someone else's lipstick on it. And while our waiter cleaned out another glass himself for me, he also poured the wine from the dirty glass in it..."}
{"text":"What a disaster of a dinner.  We show up and order our apps and dinner at the same time.  Over an hour and 20 minutes later our main course hasn't arrived.  When walking back to ask the waiter if he put in our order the manager wants to argue and tell us that seafood takes longer to cook than other dishes.  Note to manager:  Don't argue with the customer.  Apologize and act like you give a damn.  We weren't asking for a discount or anything else, just wanted to know when we could eat and get out of there.
Will I return?  Hell no, nor will any of the others who were with me.
As for my pasta dish, it wasn't bad but Bucca's is much better.

By sharing my review on Facebook, I want the manager to realize that actions have consequences.  Don't be a jerk."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent family birthday dinner at S&V. They have a wonderful diverse menu with delicious food and excellent service! All of the staff were kind, courteous and attentive. The decor is also beautiful. Everyone chose different entrees and all were equally enjoyable. We highly recommend S&V for a quality meal!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  My husband, myself and our 4 year old daughter came in on a busy Friday night and we were seated within about 10 minutes.  The kiddos pizza was delicious, charcuterie board was so good and we loved the different bruschetta.  Goat cheese and pancetta ones were our favorite.  I had an amazing spicy whiskey sour.  Service was impeccable.  We had the chef's daughter waiting on us and she was amazing and super informative.  We used our Yelp deal and got $15 off.  

We just moved to the area and this will definitely be one of our staples!"}
{"text":"Love the food, the atmosphere, the simple elegance of this place and the kindness of the waiters! We ordered chicken Marsala, Risotto with frutti di mare, Shrimp scampi, a big salad, dessert (Italian doughnuts called zeppole, with chocolate dip and strawberry dip) and loved it all! Kids' portions of pizza and pasta are big! You'll eat great, not spend too much and have a fantastic time! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love S&V. 

Quinn is a manager supreme. She takes care of all matters at hand no matter how small. She is truly dedicated. 

Jordan is the best server ever. He knows exactly what we want and even though he may not be our server on a particular night he will instruct our server on our usual orders.

Lastly, the food is great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious food, romantic atmosphere. Hubby and I went on a date to S&V and had a lovely time. We dined indoors.

Our server was pleasant, but after ordering, our food took along time to arrive including the two appetizers we orders. Our meatball sliders was on the cool side, like it had been sitting. Our bruschetta board was sumptuous. We had the salmon, fig and ricotta, salami and prosciutto with arugula. The salmon was alright. The salami was peppy and zippy with the pepperoncini. Our favorite was the arugula with the crispy prosciutto with the tangy dressing. We ended our evening with the fig and whipped ricotta. It was mild and smooth, perfect to end our evening.

Hubby and I split our entree, the star of the show: Milan's Chicken. Lightly floured pan-friend chicken breasts, topped on grilled asparagus, with a diced avocado, tomato, basil drizzled oil and vinegar. It was truly a refreshing, texturrific meal. We will be back.

Props to a lovely lady in charge who helped us get our meals going when our wait at the beginning was long. We toasted to a lovely meal over a glass of chardonnay."}
{"text":"Tucked into a corner off Shea Blvd near the 101. Great Italian Food, best clams ever and so many other intriguing items on the menu that a second and third visit are a must.
Our waiter Jordan was informative, efficient and and fun. This place is definitely on our short list for favorites in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The spaghetti with clams!!  Most clams I've ever had!  Almost....almost didn't finish it.  Bruschetta was delicious.  The bread was crispy yet soft.  Get the PLT...hmmmm! Fettuccine with chicken, my daughter loved it.  Cocktails, a bit lacking on the alcohol. Stick with beer or wine.  Great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. 
I never get tired of eating here. Friendly staff, a banging happy hour, fun ambience and GOOD Italian food. It's rare in AZ that you can find authentically yummy Italian food, but S&V delivers EVERY TIME. 
This is where I go for date night, girls night, when I have out of town visitors, business lunches and basically any time I'm craving a good meal out or just a great glass of wine (my favorite is the Montepulciano on Happy Hour, reminds me of when I was traveling through Tuscany)....
Tonight I had the Penne Vodka, and it was delicious. Vodka sauces often run too thin, but this one was juuust right. The pasta was cooked to perfection, not too soft and not undercooked. I was driving tonight so I didn't have any wine, but my server kept my iced tea full and brought me extra sugar and lemon. It's simple things like that which make this place a must... 
Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"When this was Stone & Vine we dined here several times but lost interest.  One of our Scottsdale neighbors recommended it the other day and we came back. My manhattan was good and reasonably priced. My wife felt her negroni was kind of weak and she isn't much of a drinker. She then had a fig  mule that she liked better.  My wine was a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that was fine.  I had the clam linguine which was about as good as any I have had over the years and I use it to evaluate Italian restaurants. My wife had a fig and prosciutto pizza which was great as we remember from other years.  Service was good but we were overlooked on water for a time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What is going on with the staff tonight?! Nobody is smiling, happy or helpful. Food service took SUPER long. Had to ask about our dinner...which was easy. Salad and spaghetti and meatballs Waited for about 15 min for a chocolate mousse which is already prepared. Noticed the table next to us was slow in receiving their order. Bummer. And $90 with tip for this. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"We usually love this place but last nite was the exception. I asked if they would make calamari and linguine. The waiter asked the kitchen and they kindly oblidged. Whe I was served there was no calamari at all, but rather a white fish that was cubed to resemble calimari steak pieces. I reordered a different entree and was served when the rest of my party was finished eating. No apology, no adjustment, nothing. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Tried a pizza and bruschetta for take out (surprisingly it was delicious even when we got it home) and then dined in and ordered pasta dishes. Delicious. Hearty Italian fare done right. Nice atmosphere and our server was quick and attentive but we did not feel rushed. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This was very delicious. My husband and son and I went and we all loved everything we ordered. The service was wonderful as well"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here late on a Monday night for dinner. Around 830pm. I ordered the shrimp scampi and my husband ordered a chicken dish. Both were pretty good... we couldn't find anything  to complain about; however, nothing really  stood out to us either or wow-ed us...  would definitely come back and try different things."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Amazing food! My husband and I were blown out of the water! Definitely our favorite new Italian restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service, clean and delicious eggplant Parmesan yummy. Anytime I come here I enjoy my dish. Love the new outside patio. Edden is always very friendly and welcoming to all the customers. If I open a restaurant I'd like to hire him :-))"}
{"text":"The salad was tasteless, eggplant starter was ok and the pizza was dry and not much taste there either. The place itself is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"As I walked in I was greeted by Katy. She offered me the best customer service and we requested to sit in her section. She gave me the greatest hospitality I've ever received in a restaurant. I would highly recommend requesting her as your server, you won't be disappointed! Katy's the best!"}
{"text":"Love their food and the environment. Great location too. The staff is friendly and I love their appetizers. Will be back"}
{"text":"I love S&V they have great food and its a great place to have happy hour. The only downside is it gets so busy you can't get a seat in the bar area to enjoy happy hour, even if you arrive during the week as early as 4:30 you won't get a spot. I guess all the old people that live around there get there at 3 and take all the seats. It might be nice if they had some \"overflow seating\" would allow happy hour menu prices outside of the bar since there aren't enough seats. I enjoy coming here but often choose other establishments because getting a seat is a problem."}
{"text":"A very nice local hangout for lunch or dinner. Service is great, food simple but well prepared. The atmosphere is Soho, so a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and have never been disappointed with any visit. The menu is diverse and vast for all taste buds. My girlfriend is addicted to the mussels although I am partial to the clams in a white wine sauce. 
Our last visit we had the pleasure of meeting Edden Bell the Manager. He was personable, engaging and very approachable. He made an effort to pop over and make sure we were being well taken care of the whole night. 
If you're looking for a great meal or even just a quick cocktail I highly recommend you check this place out. 
Thanks Edden, keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Twice in the past month I've be fortunate enough to have a nice meal here with loved ones. Inside, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a modern yet rustic feel. The patio outdoors is surprisingly cozy and really captures the beautiful year end nights here in Phoenix. 

The food is on point and consistent. Some dishes are of course better than others, but the pear arugula salad is pretty good, as is the strawberry fields. The soups were a good way to warm up with a little chill in the air. One of the best parts is the fact that these dishes are perfect for two. Split a soup, salad, some bread, and a bottle of wine. Perfect. Otherwise the entrees are very generous as well and there are some decent choices as well, such as the classic veal picatta. Canolis and coffee for dessert? You betcha. Service on point? Of course, just be sure to ask for Jordan; he will take care of you (tell him Chris sent you). 

Anyway, take a date here, take your parents here, bring some friends from out of town. Keep in mind, food almost always tastes better at home if you know what you're doing. It's just nice to have someone else cook for you and serve you with family and friends. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was ok however the service was not very good.   

Primavera very bland and disappointing but the piccata was very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a handful of times & decided not to write a review until now. Why? You ask. Well because I try to give businesses more then one chance to prove, they are worth either a bad, ok, good or great review. Based on my last 5 experiences I choose to leave this restaurant in the \"ok\" catagoey. The service has never been bad but the food (in my opinion) is mostly tasteless. For instance I've had their meatball appetizer & it tastes like Costco's frozen meatballs, their garlic knots were over baked, the eggplant rollatini was good but in my opinion ricotta & provolone, together in that dish didn't compliment each other. I've had most of their bruschetta options, ehhh all were average flavor, except I did like the whipped ricotta & fig one, but again the bread was over baked to the point it was crispy crunchy throughout. I've had a few of their \"guest special pizzas\" as well as the chicken pesto & monte bianco & just never been wowed with flavor. With other options in the area they need to step up their flavor game. Given, I live in this area & have been to many spots over the years, this isn't one that would be a \"go to\" when I am hungry for great tasting food. If you really want a flavorful pizza try: Ciao Grazzie or McFate Brewing (both in the area) 
Like the little sign says in their tables, new name but same good food & same faces. With the renovation not much has changed."}
{"text":"Yet again, S&V does not disappoint. Daniel is still hands down the best Bartender I've experienced. Maggie and Sheena just make coming here an enjoyable outing. Between the linguini alla checa, Milano flatbread, margarita pizza, and the salmon salad - choice choice choice. Plus I'm loving the new Happy Hour menu!!! Meatball Sliders!!!!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The most important reason why my wife and I go to S & V is Denise, the best bartender in the world. The food is awesome too."}
{"text":"We have not been here in years.  Disappointed dinner

Calamari was great
Caprise was fair.  Tomatoes had no taste and cut to thick 
Clams In white broth were bland and had no seasoning. 
Clams in linguini was fair. Linguini was bland and pasta not cooked enough
Chicken parmigiana was to much marinara 

Waitresses were delightful

Food disappointing

No more Italian food here for me"}
{"text":"Very good.  I had 1/2 panini and caesar salad. I had a bloody mary and my friend had 1/2 panini and their vegetable soup.  It was really good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Formally Stone and Vine, they say same menu & same face but I felt like they improved a lot since my last visit here a year ago (I rated as 3 stars then and didn't come back).

Beautiful decor inside. Love their candles. Really classy yet casual in a way that good for a date night as well as good for family/friends get together.

Service was exceptional last night. Alyssa was friendly and attentive with really nice smiles.  Other servers/bartender as well as the owner stopped by to check on us. 

Based on a previous visit experience, I ordered basics, familiar menu available anywhere. Margherita pizza was still as good as I remembered, four cheese ravioli was good but a bit small in portion size, pasta with clam sauce came out good with nice pasta texture. Garlic bread served with pasta was lukewarm, I think it would have tasted better if it was served fresh out of oven hot.

Sweet desert was perfect portion size to share and nice way to end good dinner.

Good happy hour price. Happy hour is daily from 3-7pm."}
{"text":"Ordered medium rare stake salad for $15. Steak was overcooked and came with a measly amount of salad. Not sure why they would even offer it as an option on the menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends. Had the chicken parmesan if you could call it that. It was the worst chicken parmesan I ever had. I found it very odd they did not even come around with cheese or at least have it on the table. What about some good bread? I thought I was at an Italian restaurant. not some soggy piece you put on the dinner plate. And as far as your sauce, you need to get a new recipe. It tasted like straight up tomato paste. The chicken was very dry and over Deep Fried.. And for what you are charging, you should be able to give a nice piece of chicken not the paper thin size with bread crumbs that you try to hide under your so called sauce."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant many times when it was Stone and Vine and the food and service was outstanding. I just visited this establishment under its new name and while the menu is essentially the same, the service and quality  of the food is poor. The pizza was cold and dry. It tasted like a thawed out stale frozen pizza. The harvest salad presentation was not the same and the taste was average. The place was slow which would suggest better service, however that was not true. How sad that a place which was fantastic in the past has transformed itself into a below average restaurant. Too many others in the valley which are so much better....."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time and it was really terrific!  The service was great.  Our server was very helpful with the menu, courteous and competent.

We started with a side Caesar Salad and it was very good.  Then we had their Burrata with Roasted Tomatoes and house-made Pesto.  Yum!  The pesto was great and the tomatoes with balsamic were yummy.  The bread served with it was a bit thick and maybe not toasted enough, but didn't deter from the dish.  On to the main course, we had their Lasagne which was superb.  Made with both pulled pork and beef; very artfully put together, not in a glued together stack but a looser presentation which I loved and was totally delish!  We paired our dinner with a bottle of Jackson Estate Chardonnay that they were showcasing and it was perfect! Great Italian in a casual setting.

Really liked the ambiance and the fact that it is local and convenient to us.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The lasagne was awful! Who puts shredded beef in lasagne?  The salmon cakes were very dry, and the salad that came with them was soaked in a  terrible dressing. Been there before and food was good, so this was a surprise and big disappointment."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a party of 9 for my parents anniversary.  I specifically asked for a table when i called, because my mother is handicapped and not able to sit on a high top.  After waiting for 1/2 hour past our reservation, I asked to speak to the manager (male salt/pepper hair).  He was visibly irritated, and incapable of holding back his frustration and emotions.  He went away, and came back in 5 minutes to rudely inform me that they had a high top available to seat us.  When I told him that we made the reservation specifically asking for a table because my mom was not not able to sit at a high top, he shrugged his shoulders and rudely told me to \"take it or leave it\".  I've booked their private room in the back of the restaurant twice before ( for large birthdays), but I'm not setting foot in that restaurant again, even though it's located 2 miles from my house.  

The owners & people running the restaurant need to understand that when someone is going pay $15-20 for a plate of Italian food they can cook themselves at home for under $3, they need to be EXTREMELY welcoming, put customer service at the forefront, and be INCREDIBLE hosts.  I always give restaurants a 2nd and 3rd chance when they have an off night (food or delays).  With that said, there's no excuse for a EXTREMELY bad attitude and showing disrespect towards your patrons."}
{"text":"Had delicious dinner here. The *PESCI e GAMBERETTI, Pan seared salmon & shrimp on top of sautéed baby spinach, roasted red & green peppers, capers, garlic, shallots, basil & white wine butter sauce was definitely a winner!

Beautiful modern decor, very nice service. Loved the Bruschettas, it was amazing as well.
I will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family and yes I would like to comeback for more.
Thank you S&V Urban Italian."}
{"text":"I found this place on accident on my last trip in Arizona and I was so happy I did, so when we went to visit my family in Arizona this weekend I knew we couldn't leave without stopping by here again. It was even better this time around, the staff were so nice, the management came by to check on our table and gave us some great recommendations, and the food was INCREDIBLE! I have a dream that they will open a location in Los Angeles, i really haven't ordered or tried a single thing here that wasn't great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone looking for awesome Italian food, great service and a great price!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a friends recommendation for a nice happy hour meeting location. Enjoyed our appetizers and drinks while sitting on the patio. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We came here for a post funeral event. Service was excellent. Food was delicious. For a restaurant near a cemetery, this spot is a great one! Be sure to try the artichoke bruschetta."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Love the meatballs and wine!! Great service , excellent food .... and everyone knows your name cheers!!"}
{"text":"The service is okay.  The quality of food should always be at happy hour prices because the quality is not good.  Better pizza can be had out of the frozen food section at the grocery store.  Over all the food has little taste.  They spent a bunch of money remodeling and yet the food is the same crap.  Revamp the menu and get rid of the card board crust pizza.  Decent location, wish they would put a Decent Resturant in that space."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the gnocchi! I had them put the spicy sauce on it and it was awesome. The rest of the food was good as well."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it was wonderful! We sat at the bar and Whitney immediately said hello and offered us the last ten minutes of happy hour. She was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the meatball sliders to start- excellent meatballs just could use a little more marinara. The happy hour menu and drinks have great pricing and variety. We then split the bruschetta and chicken piccata. Both very good! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"On saturday march 4th we went here with a group of 11 people, so not huge. I called before asking if i need reservations and the gentleman said no, but he will put together a table for 11 people as i asked. On the phone it sounded very nice, and the gentleman was polite and engaging. Well when we got to the restaurant the first person that we saw was a pregnant woman which was surprised that we had a party of 11, and didnt know what to do. She left us not saying anything and we were wondering whats going on, until a nice gentleman came and sat us down. For sure that's not a great way to start lunch at a restaurant in Scottsdale. At the table, our server came and not even saying her name or even greeting us, she started to put napkins on the table and then asked us what we want to drink but she looked like she hated her life. Sure enough when we started to ask question about the menu and the food on the menu she was answering like she didn't want to talk to us. Besides all this we were maybe 10 min before happy hour and we asked if we can have a menu or order off the happy hour, but our waitress started an explanation that she has to put in now and we have to wait until 3 pm even though we weren't far away from 3pm when happy hour starts. The food was alright not the best, the chicken in my pastas could've been more cooked and not left raw, also there can be put more chicken not just 8 to 10 pieces. Overall the experience at a restaurant from Scottsdale was awful and i will probably not go again to this italian restaurant. It is lacking in customer service like no other, and for customers matters how you are treated, which that results in people coming back and telling their friends good things about the restaurant. But i will for sure not come here anytime soon, maybe never."}
{"text":"This place is the awesome. Some of the best Italian food in Scottsdale! We got the meatballs and they were unreal. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"S&V is always our go to restaurant with family and friends.  It has consistently good service, great food and an all around warm ambiance.  They have recently updated the menu which still includes all our favorites. We have tried many items and have never been disappointed.  They offer a nice variety of bruschetta which are all outstanding, as are the many salads.  Our other favorites include the wood-fired pizzas, Milan's chicken, Salmon piccata, and any of the pasta dishes. What really brings us back time and time again are the great people at S&V!  They are always very friendly, offer great advice about the different items on the menu and treat you like family!  There is also a nice patio area. We highly recommend S&V for delicious Italian food and an overall enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Good customer service, good food! I had heard of this place back when it had its old name and always wanted to try it. They have so many vegetarian options, I could've spent like an hour deciding but figured no one would appreciate that haha.
We started off with garlic knots and burrata. The garlic knots were some of the best I've ever had, I think I ate like half the plate of them haha. They are crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and just the right amount of garlic. Then we got the burrata which was not too bad, was not my favorite though. For my meal I got eggplant rollatini and it was yummy! Not the cutest presentation for that one there haha but I still thought it was very good! Kind of wish I would've ordered a pizza though because those looked so good. And the bruschetta looks yummy too. For dessert we got a zeppoli, I'm not sure how to spell it. But it was like fluffy flaky bites with chocolate and raspberry sauce. The chocolate sauce I think was just Hershey's but the raspberry was really yummy, I ate a ton of those too. I don't think I've ordered this much from a restaurant in a long time haha. I would happily return here!"}
{"text":"Nice place with good service, very loud, needs some sound absorbing furniture, walls & ceilings! We found it difficult to have conversation! The food was OK but not the best Italian! My Lasagna needed a little more sauce, my wife said her Gnocchi was good! We both thought the Garlic bread was different and not very good! If we lived closer we might go again but just for the wine (good selection) and appetizers!"}

S & V, you are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the valley of the sun 
Whether near to me or far
Your balsamic, yummy, how you are
I think I'll Yelp, day and night

S & V, why is it so 
That this pasta for me, lingers wherever I go?
In a roaring, hour's boom
In a gaze, of Sophia Loren's room
I think I'll Yelp, day and night


Okay I can't stop looking at Sophia Loren; she's so glamorous and beautiful.  Needless to say, the entire restaurant is well laid out and aesthetically pleasing; very open with a welcoming feel.  

I came late one night with some friends to grab small bites and drinks.  We started with a Caprese Salad, Calamari, and some a bruschetta board.  One of my friend ordered their Fettuccini pastas since she was really hungry.  The mozzarella on our caprese salad was tad bit stiff and hard, as if it was left on the top part of the freezer, but the balsamic top was solid and on point.  The calamari came out piping hot right off the press and we let it cool a bit but was good afterwards.  The marinara that came along with it was sweet and zesty and had a strong creamy texture that held well.  

For our bruschetta we ordered the four; Pear & Brie, PLT, Spicy Salami, and Salmon.  I really loved the fig jam on the pear and brie, bringing out a earthy taste while sweet because of the drizzled honey and finalized with the crisp pear and subtle texture of the brie.  The PLT had prosciutto, arugula, balsamic, and mascarpone.  Probably my favorite because the balsamic again was solid and sweet along with the bitter arugula and salty prosciutto; make this bite a long song to your palate.  The spicy salami was alright I thought; just a cold pizza I thought haha.  As for the salmon, it was nothing I've had since it was smoked salmon topped with some pickled capers and had a strong dill flavor.  

Moreover, I had a small bite of my friends fettuccini and it was definitely creamy with a hint of garlic which really brought of the flavors of this pasta.

In the end, S & V or Stone and Vine really hit on some spots bringing out traditional Italian recipes along with a modern take on it.  The place again is beautiful and the service was on key all night.  Definitely a spot I can call home especially during Happy Hour! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The biggest surprise was  the prices. Based on Location. and the elegance of the restaurant I was expecting big dollar menu but everything was very nicely priced Great food Great Atmosphere and excellent service by Meghan First time here but not the last Really fun place to be Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place has gone to the bottom of the barrel with the new owner and management. The staff have always been great. I have been  coming 2+ times a week and  unfortunately today was the last time....BIG \"F\" if I could give ZERO STARS I WOULD! 
I simply requested to substitute something on the menu that they have and the GM came over and said we can not do this. OMG really? Absolutely backwards thinking with terrible customer service ! We wanted fried zucchini instead of all the other veges they include... we have been coming here for their zuccini for some time and being a neighborhood place it was nice and convenien. A simple request, right? Well according to her she was going to write up ALL the waiters and bar tenders who have been accommodating their customers.. Again, really? 
WOW it's like when you order a salad and ask for blue cheese instead of goat cheese. Well as I sit here writing this the owner walks over very defensive and not even knowing what's on his menu arguing with us that they don't have it on the menu as we correct him he goes back to the kitchen to find out... He was so inflexible and being unreasonable. With all the restaurants to choose from  Bottom line owner had a major attitude, big ego and has no idea of how to run a restaurant, he was being arguementitive and rude to us all over something so small it was ridiculous. This is NOT like the old Stone & Vine and the new owner and management structure are failing miserably. I have never come across an owner of a restaurant that carried himself in  such a poor manner, very unfortunate. We left the negative energy behind and enjoyed ourselves at another  restaurant in the neighborhood that treated us very well. Something that could have been handled in 2 minutes with happy customers that would have continued coming back and supporting this establishment left me with a very bad taste my mouth. Unacceptable. My sugge6 go gown the road to \"Il Bosco\" food and service is impeccable"}
{"text":"I got takeout for myself and my colleague for dinner here a couple of weeks ago.  We shared a Caesar salad and the Godfather pizza.  This was probably my most favorite Caesar salad ever!  It's amazing how few restaurants get this simple dish wrong, but S&V's Caesar dressing is the best!  The pizza was legit as well.  Friendly staff and very nice ambiance - although I didn't get to enjoy it because I had to get back to the office."}
{"text":"We (3 of us) visited the place 1st time last Saturday night. We had Calamari for starter and it's great. We also shared a Caesar salad which was also very good. I had chicken piccata. It's good but it had too many capers and herbs for my taste. My husband had rack of lamb and he loved it. My son had lasagna and it's a bit disappointing for him. It looked a bit dry and also, instead of the meat sauce within layers of noodles, the meat sauce was kind of poured on top of the noodles with chesse inside.

The service was really good (sorry I forgot the waitress name) We had water right not long after we sat down and our waitress took our drink order. When our son arrived a little bit later, she appeared right away to take his drink order. She gave us time to go through the menu and since I hadn't decided what to order when she returned, she took our order for appetizers and promptly took our orders for food when the appetizers arrived. Overall, she's attentive and did not go over (I am not a fan of wait staff keeps coming and asks if everything is OK or we need anything)

The price is very good considering the location and ambience of the restaurant and quality of the food."}
{"text":"We came here the first time after my wife found a 30% rebate on Groupon. I'm always leery of restaurants that offer a Groupon, we have had several bad experiences. This place was great and we have been back several times now. I was really looking forward to the short ribs but missed it by a day. I've tried a couple things on the menu now and have liked both. The portions are very good too, I always have lunch for the next day! Looking forward to trying the short ribs this fall!! This is my new favorite itialian place :-)"}
{"text":"This place is okay. We came for happy hour to try some of their various items. 

The calamari was good and tasty. The meatballs were decent and hearty and they had a good marinara sauce on them. The bruschetta board was mediocre. Many of the bruschetta toppings didn't have the right balance of flavors (such as way too much balsamic on them). We tried the Rosa pizza (I think it was called...on the specials menu). The crust was good, but the spicy salami (I think it was) overpowered the whole thing. 

All in all, I would say it was ok and worth a try, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in for a quick dinner
Last Saturday visited this neighborhood restaurant  & will not hurry back - our server was 
In the clouds - had to ask several times for ous water, refresh coffee & why was a simple Cobb said taking 30 minutes- everyone one around us were happy with their waiters - I guess we were not that lucky ones with an inexperienced waiter -normally a Waiter comes & asks how we are doing & refresh drinks - I had to ask another waiter for water - our waiter would disappear from the floor- the cobbs salads  were just ok - lettuce wilted, and very little chicken- waiter said kitchen was busy with deserts - had I ordered Desert first - I might have been happier"}
{"text":"A pleasant eatery with good food. I had the artichoke special which I enjoyed immensely. My wife and I shared some eggplant which was as good as we've had recently in the Valley of the Sun. My espresso was particularly good, so good that our friends who were with us tried a sip and ordered one for themselves.  Definitely a place to which we'll return. I know we'll try the eggplant parmesan and possibly the veal as well. I will say that the restaurant was understaffed, but our waitress did her job."}
{"text":"S&V, formerly Stone and Vine is a place I've been frequenting for years. The primary motivation in the past was the service I would receive from Maggie. Maggie has been my go to bartender since the Office days and still provides impeccable service. I have dined here many times but todays lunch was review worthy. The salmon salad was delicious. Prepared expertly with just the right amount of seasoning and doneness. The greens were fresh and the red onion and tomato diced like Cowboy Ciao. The vinaigrette, like Maggie, had a hint of sweetness and plenty of tang. If you're  in the hood on Wednesday for lunch, give the salmon and Maggie a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't live in PHX anymore but make it a point to come back here when in town. It is rare I try everything on menus as I stick to my dishes but this is not the case with their lunch menu. I have tried them all!! I've also had dinner here, don't get me started on the garlic knots....yummmm. A cute date night spot that also works as a good lunch place."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! Wonderfully decorated, cozy and welcoming. Our server was so kind and knowledgeable and was really great about refilling drinks even on a busy Friday night. 
The food was good, but not great. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, I just don't know that the food was worth the price. It was pretty expensive for food that was just kind of missing the wow factor and real flavor. We shared the garlic knots, I had the white pizza and my husband had the seafood risotto. I will say that the dessert was worth it! It was a sundae special and you could taste that the caramel was house made! Super yummy on the coffee gelato!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice.  The waiter was nice but had no idea what was on the menu.  We ordered the eggplant appetizer and he had no idea what was in it.  No problem the menu said what was in it.   He described a fish special which sounded good to me and my wife.  I asked very specifically about the sauce because I did not want a sweet sauce like Marsala.   We were assured that it was a light cream sauce.  Everything else sounded great.   The food arrived much later and while it was not a brown marsala sauce, it sure as heck was not a cream sauce.  It was a like a semi-sweet and very sower clear reddish sauce.  I couldn't tell you what it was but it was not very pleasant.  So, the fish was actually decent on its own, but they put some very old and hard to chew meat under it that was absolutely nasty.  Chunks of stuff they really should have thrown away but they put it under the fish. There must have been a single stalk of asparagus under there also.  That was the meal.  We sat there scratching our heads.  So we ate fish, paid the bill, and got the hell out.

It wasn't all bad.  Some parts of the experience were ok, but it looks like the place is not run very professionally."}
