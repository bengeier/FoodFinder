{"text":"I work close by so I chose to eat here one day. The place is very small and located in a end of a circular driveway of the NorthTown. Actually it was my husband that suggested we go in, and once inside we faced a huge board with about 40-50 different types of rolls, hence the name. There were the regular raw sushi rolls, and they also had cooked rolls and vegetarian rolls. After reading the menu, we asked for some suggestions. The guy at the front told us to get the Sunflower roll and another kind, so we did, but I don't remember the other one. Both were really good. I especially liked the Sunflower one, I guess that's why I remember the name.  Now keep in mind, that if you want to take a date here to impress, then this would not be the place visually, but if you're with friends and you just want some really, like really good stuff, then this is it. This place is worth a visit to next time you're around the Yonge and Finch area."}
{"text":"This small place serves Japanese / Korean food.  They have a good selection of food from Korean staples and Japanese sushi rolls. Food and drinks are priced right with some appetizers given.  The place is tiny with about 5 tables.  Parking can be found either beside the place, Yonge street or underground at the supermarket nearby."}
{"text":"Yey, this is my favorite sushi place! I love the sushi they make, they are sooo delicious and really cheap. I used to live right across the street and went there really often, trying almost all sushi they have. My favorite one was Calamari Roll but.. they changed it a bit. It used to be with minced crab meat but now its just a crab stick. Anyways, I can not wait to go there again! This place also sells really tasty Miso soup. There are only about 3 tables, so order to go."}
