{"text":"Looked like a nice, neighborhood joint, but do yourself a favor and stay away. Smoke filled lounge/restaurant/bar. My food tasted like smoke. Waitress was overly friendly and tried to get involved in our business...making awkward comments and even rubbed my shoulder. Weird. Food was terrible...think microwave specials. They tried, but in my opinion didn't succeed. Draft beer was warm, but at least they had IC in bottles. We will not be returning. We were the only diners at 6:30 on a Friday night and this should have been my first clue. Bathrooms not maintained, gross. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer to catch the end of the Steelers game. I'm in the service industry and always try to let things slide. I'll never walk back in this bar and give them any of my money again! Apparently there is a private party going on but no sign or anything on the door. The bartender and I believe owner was so fucking rude to me because I don't know how to read minds and didn't know it was a private party. Pittsburgh sports bar is right around the corner, the people are nice and won't treat you like shit for walking threw the door and trying to give them business!"}
{"text":"I would maybe give this bar 2.5 stars. I stopped by here to check it out on a Thursday night when the Steelers were playing. 

There's a square bar in one side with about 12 to 15 seats and then some tables on the other side. When I came in, there were about seven or eighth other patrons. Most seemed to be regulars judging by the way they were interacting with each other and the lady bartender.  

They have around five or six beers on tap. I got a Yuengling. The price was good, $3.50 for a pint. 

The best thing was that they had good viewing for the game, and they also turned the audio up so you could hear it easily. On the whole, I would say this is a good place for watching a local game. 

I didn't try any food and didn't see anyone else eating a meal so can't comment on the food. 

The establishment itself has a cluttered appearance. The decor could use some improvements. The place really seemed like a hangout for some locals."}
{"text":"This bar feels like you're in someone's house. It's pretty old-school as far as bars go. It is a smoking bar, so don't wear a nice coat. I question the cleanliness of anything, and I would not eat the food if you paid me. I had a few beers, and it was an all around decent time. It's definitely a \"Locals Only\" kind of place, and if you are not looking for that vibe then don't even go because you will definitely be pissed.

That said, if you are looking for a local type of bar, and you are willing to go back here often, this might not be too bad of a place. Kimmie seemed like a really nice lady and it just seemed like a nice little hangout, but I don't think I'll go back much."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and a great neighborhood gem.  Could use a few more tv's not tuned to game shows.

Parking is minimal as it is in a residential area, but there is some nearby."}
{"text":"Worst food ever.....what a joke posting great food as you enter the front door. I ordered a meatball hoagie. The meatballs were no where near homemade they were probably frozen and about the size of half a golf ball. The cheese was not what was advertised on the menu.  To make it even more enjoyable everything came out cold and uncooked. Do not and I repeat do not waste your money going there. Horrible waste of money!!!!!!

It is now been 4 days since the owner responded by saying she would refund my debit card. However this has not happened as of yet......"}
{"text":"The place in Castle Shannon we intended to go to this evening turned out to be cash only, so we stopped by Kimmie's late this afternoon after passing it a few times in recent weeks. 

Hey, my interest was piqued once I saw the sign that read, \"Food served all day!\" I can't resist, y'know? 

It turns out that Kimmie's is merely one of those quiet little suburban bars that is frequented mainly by people who all seem to know each other. You feel strange when you first walk in but feel more comfortable as time wears on. 

Based on what we had for dinner, I'd say the food isn't what draws people here. Kay's coconut shrimp and potato pancakes were a little overdone. My crabcakes looked and tasted pre-fabricated and were only marginally filled with crabmeat. Although I've had better, the coleslaw was sweet, crunchy, and was served in a big-hearted heap of a portion. 

The pierogi we had as an appetizer were crispy on the outside and were full of fluffy potatoes. Not bad, but again, there are superior 'rogi to be found. 

The rest of the menu is small and includes pizza, steak, and a bunch of different sandwiches. I almost ordered Kimmie's Sub. Meh. Then I almost ordered the corned beef. Meh. 

Most of the patrons were really into \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" which aired on the telly and was nearing its conclusion. 

I really dug the glasses our beverages were served in. Mine was Beatles-themed! Kay's was inspired by \"The Hangover\" and had a line from the movie on it.

The bartender, whom I assumed was Kimmie herself, seems like a really congenial, convivial person brimming with chutzpah. She jokingly interrogated me on my activities during the day.

\"You didn't work today?\"

\"No, I was off. The place I work for is closed Thanksgiving and the day after.\"

\"Oh, baloney! You called off  'cause you were hungover. Meanwhile, your lady was out workin'!\"

\"No, I...\"

\"Did ya at least do some shoppin'? I hope ya bought this cutie sittin' across from ya somethin' nice.\"

Kimmie: Surrogate Mother-In-Law. 

I suppose that's why I wish I liked the food more than I did."}
