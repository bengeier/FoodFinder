{"text":"Terrible service took 2 hours for 2xl pizzas for delivery. Pizza was cold. Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"First time I ordered, didn't deliver one of my items, also asked on the phone when ordering for the delivery guy to be able to break a $100, only breaks it into $20s, causing an awkward tipping situation.  Next time I ordered we were really sick in the room and the point of delivery was to not leave the room. Lazy delivery guy calls and insists I come down to get it that he wouldn't be able to because of security (which is crap, we ordered at the same time last time), and I tell him I'm not feeling well and the point of delivery was to not leave the room, but he insists, completely defeating the purpose. I could have just gone downstairs. Says 5 mins, leaves me waiting downstairs looking and feeling like crap in public for 20. Oh, and there was no security, so he could have come up no problem.  Oh, AND when ordering, mentioned the missing item from last time and they neither refunded me the difference or offered a \"free\" item to make up for the $5 they effectively stole. She just commented that there's no note on my file - and I said because I intended on ordering again and was just going to mention it now since it's not like they're going to make a trip back just for missed dessert. (Second order was only a couple days after the first.)  About the actual food - cheese pizza is really good, other pizza we had with mushrooms wasn't good, and caesar salad is an awful waste of money (really stale croutons were gross)."}
{"text":"My mom and I called this place at 12:30 am. They said it would take 1 hour we were totally fine to wait. We ordered 2 xl pizza one with all meat and another super Hawaiian pizza. With 2 wings boxes and 2 cherry Pepsi. 1hour and a half pass and so my mom called and asked them what's going  on and then says there coming in a couple minutes. Nobody came and  then called again saying they called (yet no called was received) after  lady on the phone started giving attitude \"well ,you didn't answer your phone and if we give you , your order to you it will be cold\" my mom told the lady we are not going to pay for damn cold pizza and made them remake everything so we had to wait another 1! Still took longer then that still. My mom is diabetic and pregnant she needs to eat! When they actually finally made the delivery it was 4:15. Still paid $61.46 she did not give us a receipt and we only got 1 soda and the pizza barley had any toppings for being super Hawaiian and all meat it look like a normal  pizza. The Hawaiian one we ate was okay even know it was missing toppings. But, all meat was nasty doughy only ate 3 pizza of the topping only cause the actual crust and part of the pizza  was doughy. Called right now to talk to the manger at 11:20 and it was the same lady and then tells my mom why didn't we complain earlier when it happen.  Well here's the idea maybe its because it was already 4 in the god damn morning !!! And we are tired of even calling over and over about the order. And we needed out sleep specially from driving from southern California to here 3 hour drive. Can't believe it  too from us placing the order from 12:30 to get all are food at 4:15 just crazy worst service in the world would not recommended this to know one!"}
{"text":"I would give it a zero if I could.   Ordered a calzone at 5:04.  At 6:45, I call asking an ETA.  They cancelled my order without letting me know because it was \"too far.\"   On the site, you would think, it would have a range of delivery.  Very poor customer service!  They left me very hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered via Grubhub at about 2am. Projected delivery time was between 2:50 and 3:00 am. I called at 3:03am to check. They said order was out for delivery. I called back at 3:38am. They said that they were really busy and the driver had a lot of deliveries to make. Never once an apology from the restaurant until I said how hungry my wife was and then it was a sarcastic \"what am I supposed to do \" kind of I'm sorry. I called Grubhub. They contacted the restaurant and the manager said to refund the money and they would still deliver the food for our trouble. Seemed like their best move from a customer service point of view. If you guessed that we never got the food, you'd be correct. My wife and I both ate oatmeal.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"The delivery did not take too long... but the \"salad\" was literally iceberg with a few dices of tomato.. ew. Pizza was okay ish. About 2 dollars IMO. Won't go back. Ew."}
{"text":"They took 1 hr to deliver but it was brought to my room on the 8th floor. The delivery man was nice.  Pizza itself wasn't that good but it wasn't bad either.. 2 medium pizzas for $20 is ok I guess.  La pizza tardó 1 hora en llegar pero la trajeron a mi cuarto en el piso 8. El hombre que la trajo fue amable, a pesar de los 40C grados afuera. La pizza en sí no es tan buenísima pero tampoco es mala. Supongo está bien por dos pizzas medianas por $20 dólares."}
{"text":"Over an hour to deliver, and wouldn't come to the room. My brother had to wait for this guy in the lobby. The Pizza was cold, and barely had any banana peppers. They also didn't give us napkins. I don't think we'll order from them again."}
{"text":"My in law's and I ordered food and all 4 orders of Chicken Alfredo tasted like someone had poured a cup of salt in them. 2 of them had noodles that were still half hard, the wings when they got delivered and wing sauce spilt all over the bag they were in. I don't recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Not so good! Baked wings,  could have been cooked longer...only ok, not memorable at all. I stayed at a hotel, at first I was impressed that they texted my order back to me after we hung up,  but still my order was incomplete and I didn't get the dressing I had to pay $1 extra for  my wings."}
{"text":"Food was not great. Ok pizza was do-able just tastes like heated frozen pizza. However we ordered the mozzarella sticks and they were garbage. The breading fell off and it tasted so gross and bland. My boyfriend who is not picky spit it out because it was gross. They took 30 min to deliver. Then I called to complain and she asked if I still had it so that the delivery guy can pick it back up w the receipt. I thought she meant that the receipt for the return would be given to us. When I asked she(tila) gave me attitude and said we were 12 miles away so he wouldn't be doing that. They would just refund once the mozzarella sticks were brought back.  We waited another 15 min and no one came.  We called again and they said they would refund the money and to just throw away the sticks. I hope they do return my friends money cuz..no. Also don't advertise and throw fliers under our hotel door if you have a problem delivering to here.."}
