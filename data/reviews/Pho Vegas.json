{"text":"Thanksgiving Update: was out at El Dorado Mine Tours for thanksgiving but had to stop in Vegas to get some passion fruit tea and grub for the ride home :) 

Update: every time I'm in Vegas, I must stop here on my way back to Cali for a hot bowl of pho and a couple sandwiches to-go. 

Good prices. Great food. I couldn't wait to get on the road, so I took a bite before leaving the restaurant. 

I was sad when their other location closed--so glad they reopened here! Much closer to the strip! Pho is definitely a must after a heavy night of Vegas fun!! Heh heh or even on a cold night ;)"}
{"text":"Pho Vegas is another great Vietnamese restaurant this city is full of. Pho Vegas stand out from most r their friendly service n incredible Banh Mi (Vietnamese Subs). For $6, U get a foot long sub full of deli meats n vegis. They also have a vey extensive menu of dishes many others do not have. And this establishment is an iconic eatery established eons ago."}
{"text":"The pho broth is very clear and tasty...we are Vietnamese and have eaten many pho in U.S. and this one is the best, very authentic close to our mom's cooking. The foot long grill pork sandwich is yummy and only $5.95 crazy value and great tasting...this will be our regular place to visit when we come back to Vegas;)"}
{"text":"If your having a hard time finding an Asian restaurant to eat, this is the place to be. The service is great and the food good. I'm from the 626 area code and we have pho places all over here. I honestly say the pho at pho Vegas is just as good as the one in the 626 area code."}
{"text":"-yummy food
-great customer service
-friendly people
-reasonable prices


Overall really good restaurant with really good food. Happy to eat here!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious !!! We got the chicken banh mi ... SO GOOD! Also the pho was delicious ! Will be coming back here again :))"}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas,  hands down!  Moved to Vegas about a year ago and set out to find a good pho place,  tried about 5 different restaurants,  and then came to Pho Vegas and was blown away by how good their broth is. This is now the only pho place we go to."}
{"text":"Went on Thursday for lunch and was the only one there. Order a Pho and a Vietnamese sausage wrap and both was delicious! I live close by so it's nice not having to drive to Chinatown for a bowl of Pho. Definitely my go to spot now!"}
{"text":"I used the delivery service and it was perfect! They delivered straight to my room and the food was still hot. I had the chicken pho and it was delicious! The broth was well-seasoned and the chicken was moist. My mouth is getting watery just thinking about it again. Their eggrolls were filled with the right amount of veggies, noodles, and meat and their chicken wings were huge! Worth every penny, down to the delivery!"}
{"text":"Found this place listed as hot and new on Yelp.  Parking was very easy and there was no wait.  Ordered #34 with \"crunchy flank\" that tasted chewy.  Soup broth was flavorful and house made.  Noodles were cooked properly and were soft.  Prices were a bit higher than most other similar noodle houses."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  I have ordered from this place using postmates many times.  Unfortunately, my last order did not go very well - there was a hair in my sandwich. Really gross and unacceptable.

P.S. This just happened this afternoon, so just heads up to whomever is working in the kitchen this afternoon to please be more careful."}
{"text":"This is the best pho place in Vegas. I come to Vegas every year in search of a great pho restaurant and Pho Vegas is by far the best one. The serving sizes are huge and one bowl of pho could feed 2-3 people. If you are in search of some absolutely amazing and authentic Vietnamese food, Pho Vegas is your answer."}
{"text":"Large pho and grilled pork sandwich!! Be ready to be happy. Large pho feels like extra large. Generous amount of meat and noodle. Broth were very good. The sandwich is long! Generous amount too. Would recommend this place! Wish this restaurant was in MI! FYI - the staff were friendly too."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time dining inside the restaurant and what a mistake that was! Count on at least 30 minutes until someone comes to take your order. I ordered the spring rolls and Chicken Pho. When the spring rolls arrived (20 minutes later) I was starving and took a bite. Well, I quickly found a LONG piece of hair right inside AFTER I took a bite. From that moment, I got up and walked out of the restaurant. I will NEVER eat here again, EVER! Take the time and go to Pho Kim Long's instead."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. No one knows what they are doing. That young girl is like stupid cause she would come up to me and ask me if I finish my food yet. Weird.. 
Cashier would walk away and help other customer while I was standing in front of her like she didn't see me... 
Food is ok, but I think there is MSG in it cause I can taste it."}
{"text":"Ordered food via EAT24, wasn't delivered for 1 hour 39 minutes. Restaurant was unwilling to help at all. Poor service caused this review."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery on a Saturday for lunch. The Vegetarian Pho was very good (not too salty). BUT the Shrimp Spring Rolls were Horrible, couldn't even eat them. I figured everything would be fresh on a Saturday made to order, but I was wrong.
They were old and floppy. The lettuce was wet old and wilted. There wasn't just shrimp and veggies but a mystery meat also. These were not made fresh to order. Very disappointed considering what I paid for."}
{"text":"The food was good but I'm just so disappointed by the service that it ruined my experience. I ordered the oxtail pho. I didn't realize there was a small and large. As I was eating I was thinking to myself \"wow, this portion is huge! I'll def comment that on yelp for them\". I couldn't finish it at all. 

And then I got the bill and was charged for a large pho. I went online to look at their menu and noticed the size differences. When a server (a different lady from the one who took my order) came to pickup my credit card I let her know that I wasn't aware of the sizes and the waitress never asked me if I wanted a small or large. I'm a petite 4'11\" woman and I weight 105 lbs....why would the waitress automatically assume I wanted a large? So they make more money? I told her I didn't mind paying for it but the fact that the waitress never even asked me and assumed large was what upset me. 

Here comes the worst part; her response was.....\"ok well next time you come, you have to say you want small because we are not going to ask the customer. You have to tell us.\"

No sense of hospitality in this place. #smh"}
{"text":"Food Good served differently than what I'm used to. Had a side of broth and also thai tea that was very good."}
{"text":"Great food, and prices. The sandwiches are delicious!!!! Had the vermicelli bowl. It's delicious, and will bust your gut on the quantity of food they give you."}
{"text":"I crave Pho almost every day in the winter and I was so excited that a good place opened up not far from my house. It didn't disappoint!!! I've been here about ten times in the last month for to-go-pho and sit down and it's been perfect every time! Love the 35!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, two stars from the cleanliness.  This has to one of the most friendly and spotless Vietnamese restaurant.   

Although the service was slow (there were only two workers), they were both extremely polite and they consistently asked if we were satisfied.  Everything seemed fresh and at least average or great in quality.  

I had rice and beef and although the portion was smaller than other places, the beef was flavorful.  The pork and rice was appetizing and it also received high marks.  The bun bo hue was a bit thin but the portion was quite large.  The beef noodles was alright but once again the portions of beef and egg rolls were generous.  The fish dishes though, were the best.  The fish stew and clay pot fish were fresh and there were large chunks of fish in the stew.  We could easily tell that it was fresh and the broth was well seasoned.  Although it was pricer, the dish could probably feed two to three people.

The drinks here were outstanding.  I had the Thai tea and boba; the tea was good but I would skip the boba.  The avocado shake was delicious and not overly sweet.  The durian shake was great and I've had my fair share of durian drinks.  The passion fruit drink looked highly suspicious at first but it was our favorite drink.  Highly recommended.  

It made a great first stop in Vegas"}
{"text":"Uh-oh. I think Kinh Do and Dakao have some competition on their hands- the bahn mi here are cheap, huge, and tasty, with an incredible bread! The sandwiches are usually pretty low-priced but the version here is a \"foot long\" - literally two huge halves, double the portion that you get elsewhere, for only a buck or so more. My usual complaint about bahn mi is the lackluster bread- but here, it is fresh baked, fluffy, and beautiful. It almost reminds me of a challah bread. I'm definitely coming back here for more sandwiches, though the selection is a bit limited . Grab the dac biet!

The namesake pho is also a good option- broth was lighter than is typical around town, and meat was an average portion but less fatty than cuts served at other shops. Large and small sizes are offered, typically under $10. Two of us split a large and didn't finish it. I was a bit surprised to see the pho included sliced white onions. Menu has some healthier-sounding options, including a chicken pho and a shrimp version.

The spring rolls were the only item we were slightly less than blown away by- portion of two rolls came nicely plated and generously served with two cups of creamy peanut sauce. However, the filling seemed to be mostly shredded iceberg lettuce with the protein/noodles. Everything was fresh and priced appropriately though ($5).

Service was attentive and friendly- much more so than I'm used to receiving at a Vietnamese place, to be honest. The massive order above was $22 for two before tip, and was enough food to leave an entire roll and half a sandwich for my lunch the following day. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!!!! Came here for some banh mi for lunch and I was near by so stopped by here! The restaurant is very spacious and clean, plus for a newly opened spot they have great reviews! I knocked a star off because it did take a while for them to prepare my order of 2 sandwiches. BUT they were HUGE!! and tasted yummy. I look forward to trying some Pho and Rice plates soon too! Excited to see how business gets here :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food that I've been able to find in Las Vegas. The food was fast and fantastic. We got to watch as they made egg rolls by hand. The quality of the food was fantastic -- everything had such good flavor, the portion sizes were large, and the price was perfect. I highly recommend the spring rolls, especially with the delicious house made peanut sauce. I had the Bún with pork, shrimp, and egg rolls for my main dish. The servers were very polite and attentive. Our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pho can't go wrong with any of the menu items. I've been coming here for months and always good service and great food."}
{"text":"I walked out of here.  Didn't even get a chance to taste the food because the service was so bad.  I had to send back our drinks for being wrong and the woman reacted like it was my fault. Learn to be a restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Vietnamese food!!!!! Hands down the best in Vegas. Really great menu with lots of authentic choices not on normal Vietnamese restaurants menus. All the employees are very sweet. The baguette rolls are to die for. Portions are big and prices are really reasonable. I will most definitely be eating here a few more times before I leave!!! 5+"}
{"text":"This place is clean and serves good food. I have come on multiple occasions with my boyfriend and each time we have loved it. The first time I got their grilled beef sandwich and then the second time I go the pho. I have a place I used to go but its so far now but finding this place has been awesome. Their broth is fragrant and everything tastes fresh. I also ordered their mango smoothie and it was one of the best smoothies I have ever had. It was creamy and tasted just like eating a mango. Always coming here when I get a pho craving"}
{"text":"Come here hungry or with a hang over. I had a large #35 pho and I couldn't finish it. Best pho in Las Vegas! Sooo good!! This place is a must. ..."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through the Uber Eats app.  At first I was kinda iffy about a Vietnamese restaurant outside of the Spring Mountain area, but this place didn't disappoint!  Their banh xeo and it was large and delicious!  I later ordered their pho and WOW!  Is their large LARGE!  It's an amazing deal for how much food you get.  Delicious food and large portions.  I'll be making this place my new go to!"}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mi Ive had in Vegas! I had the grilled pork and it was excellent! The lemon soda was also perfect! Generous portions! Can't wait to come again and try something else! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"4/24/16

For some reason, I wanted shrimp and rice, so I figured this would probably be a good time to try Pho Vegas.

We ordered at home and did the pickup option instead of dining in. The food was ready when we got there, which was pretty fast considering it took us 15 minutes to get down to Pho.

The food was delicious, just what I needed to curb my pho cravings"}
{"text":"I have ate here twice and I have to say the food is really delicious. Base on my taste it's pretty authentic. I have tried their pho, spicy beef noodle (bun bo hue) and Vietnamese sandwich. 
Oh if you want to try traditional Vietnamese family style food they have that option too. We have asked the lady she said we have to call in first to order to avoid longer wait. 
The service is very nice. Very attentive and friendly waitress."}
{"text":"My friend loves ordering their vegetable pho, but with beef broth and extra veggies and noodles. The vegetable pho comes with Bok Choy, tofu, broccoli and a few other veggies. 

I tried the pho tai with meatballs (bo vien) and it was decent. We ordered to go and they packaged it nicely, gave us a ton of fresh veggies, noodles and meat but unfortunately the broth wasn't very flavorful. It didn't have the usual meaty flavor that I'm used to. Maybe it was because we came in 15 minutes before closing so the quality of the broth wasn't as good? 

Either way, it's only 5 minutes from my friends house so it's convenient for her. For me, I'll keep looking for a good spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho Vietnamese restaurant. My wife loves the pho #42 and, I love the #53 grilled pork chop,1 scoop rice with over easy egg, egg pork cake, sausage, and grilled shrimp. The wait staff wife of chef Van is prompt and courteous and owner chef Ken knows how to cook. Large portions and excellent prices keep us coming back often.
Simply delicious..."}
{"text":"This is the best pho place in town! They are very clean, delicious, and always listen any special requests in my order. We have ordered from this place many times and they never disappoint. Their pho and sandwiches are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has good reviews. 
Arrived here at 10:20 and they open at 10 a.m. My table was the second one there. 
My reason for a low rating is because the food took 30 minutes for us to receive and it wasn't the greatest meal I've had. There was one lady who seated us and made our drinks. And apparently one server who brought us the food. I'm assuming there was not enough staff to cook the food and make drinks, since it took so long.
We waited 15 minutes before our drinks came out. Not everyone got their drinks until about 20ish minutes. My sisters drink came last because she got an avocado smoothie. Not sure why it took so long. 
Our first plates were the Nem Nuong spring rolls. They were alright, it was thinly sliced meatloaf with some veggies, a few herbs and rice noodles. I had the combination egg noodles, my noodles were hard but everything else was good. My mom got the beef pho and she didn't finish her bowl cause the seasoning wasn't as good as our usual pho places in California. Her beef pho  had a lot of fat pieces. My dad got the \"banh hoi\" which was pretty appealing because it came with pork, shrimp, egg rolls and etc. 
the bottom line was, since I waited so long for my meal, the taste should've compensated for it."}
{"text":"Honestly I know there's so many pho places to go but I like this one because it remind me of my childhood have a wa feeling services always great.  Um and yeah that's about it.  Its not for everyone but for me this place is good it doesn't make yoy feel heavy after eating the pho thanks byeb"}
{"text":"The pho is wonderful and a pretty large portion. I also ordered a rice plate. For 11 dollars it was soooo small and it was cold. I asked for a boba shake after my meal with lil boba. Got it before with a lot of boba. So i told her little on the boba and i would like it for desert, like i ordered. She scooped the boba out and gave it to me melted instead of remaking it right. Then proceeded to make fun of me behind the counter about it. Im extremely disappointed especially it wasnt my first time here. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Like the salad with chicken and I Love the fish in Clay pot- a real treat!
 Restaurant a little outdated, but the food is worth it.
 Coconut smoothy is yummy!"}
{"text":"so so so yummy! when i arrived it was a bit empty and the food took a while but they did have lots of delivery orders so it's understandable!! i ordered a FOOTLONG bahn mi for about $6!! i will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I always ordered post mates from this location ... not anymore I got the short ribs ALL FAT not one good bite I got the most expensive rice dish. I can't believe how disappointed I am. It was honest to God disgusting do not order the short ribs! Waste of 11.00 plus Postmates fees"}
{"text":"Brilliant Vietnamese food. Good serving sizes. Bun thit nuong, i.e. Vermicelli salad was great. Pho broth was very nice. Drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but everything else was fairly priced.

Quiet, but I do hope this place gets busier as I want it to stick around."}
{"text":"I read the reviews where people raved about the banh mi and that's exactly what I tried. It's the best I've had in town. More specifically, it the BBQ pork (Banh mi xa xiu) that is amazing with its baked in-house bread blistered and crispy on the outside and chewy and airy on the inside and filled with thick slices of BBQ pork and veggies. The combination pork (Banh mi dat biet) I was less thrilled with. I've also had the Bún ga cha gio -- vermicelli noodles with grilled chicken and egg rolls -- which was pretty good. But, it's the BBQ banh mi that's the star here."}
{"text":"FOOD GOOD, BUT 20 MINS TO MAKE A SANDWICH. 

Don't come here if you're on your lunch break. I ordered a pork banh mi and waited 20 minutes. There was NO ONE eating in the restaurant, but 5 ppl working. 10 minutes in and I see the chef JUST starting to peel a cucumber...sigh

So I was late getting back to the office....great. Definitely had to knock off a star for that. 

OTHER THAN THAT...the sandwich itself was good. The only improvements I would make to it would be adding pickled veggies and adding spread. It came with 1 packet of mayo, but its a huge hassle/mess to have to unwrap the whole thing and find a knife to spread the packet."}
{"text":"I order the pho number 34 and a durian shake my hubby ordered pork rice dish that came with other stuff like an egg, sausage, steamed egg, and shrimp the portion is big and price is decent pho was good soup is good. My durian shake was really tasty it's better than most places."}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic Vietnamese - stopped by on our way through town and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! I may have a new favorite pho spot. Although I've only ordered through UberEATS, I'd love to swing by and get an actual dine-in experience sometime, especially if the rest of their menu is on par with the food that was delivered to me yesterday. Maybe give their bahn mi a try since everyone seems to be raving about it... Anyway, the menu appears to be just a large and with just as much variety as Pho Kim Long, except with a lower price point - which is awesome. I got a small order of steak, flank, and brisket noodle soup and a Thai tea with boba for about $11 - which may only be a few dollars cheaper than my usual order at Pho Kim Long - but that just made the meal even more satisfying in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is around the corner!!! Delicious food and giant portions :-)  I have been in a few times now ant the food is consistently wonderful no matter what I try."}
{"text":"TRY THIS PLACE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

Being from Hawaii originally, I've had my fair share of delicious food. We spent three years in England, two in North Carolina and we are now in fabulous Las Vegas where, once again, I can eat my heart out on all kinds of different Asian foods without driving too far (20 mins from home). I had been craving pho for quite some time before deciding to venture out after studying reviews on Yelp to figure out which places I should try.

The first place I tried was Pho Rancho. It's up the road from where we live but it didn't quite hit the spot for me. Disappointed, I turned to Yelp again and tried Viet Bistro a couple days later. It was better but wasn't mind blowing. 

Today I turned to Yelp again and found this little gem. Decided to give it a try and it was all that my belly was looking for and more! I'm so happy I tried this place and this is now my go to place for pho/any Vietnamese cravings. They have a decent sized menu with tons of options from banh mi to vermicelli to pho to rice dishes to dessert drinks. I ordered the fresh spring rolls with pork and shrimp. From the time I placed my order to the time the food was on my table was literally six minutes. SIX! I also ordered a banh mi with chicken to try and also take home for my husband for dinner. Lastly I ordered a large beef pho with flank steak only. 

Everything was so freaking good. The rolls were awesome and I'm happy it came with two peanut sauces. The pho immediately hit the spot, the broth shouldn't NEED sauces to make it taste good, it needs to hold it's own by itself and it definitely does. Something else I appreciated was that they have wooden chopsticks at the table to use! It's always so annoying to mess around with the slippery plastic chopsticks that are in the majority of Vietnamese pho places. The noodles always slip out. This place had well made wooden chopsticks that made the process of enjoying my food not take forever. The banh mi was awesome, the bread they use is incredible and such big portions for such great prices! The banh mi was $5.95 I believe but it was a foot long cut in half. Literally double the size of a regular banh mi for $1.00 more, if even that. The pho was ginormous. I still ate it all because even though I'm 5'1\", I have this super power that allows me to eat insane amounts of food. The large pho was $8.95 which, compared to the other two places I tried, was the same price as just a regular sized pho. Such great prices. The people who work there are super sweet too. I will be back soon! Definitely give this place a try! I never write a review the same day I ate at the restaurant (due to being lazy and procrastinating) but I had to do it today so anyone else craving pho and turning to Yelp knows where to go.


TL;DR. This place is AMAZING. Try it and you will not be disappointed. Quick service (rolls were ordered and at my table within six minutes, pho within 15 minutes). Great prices and fabulous wooden chopsticks."}
{"text":"I ordered fries rice with pork, chicken and shrimp. There was no pork in the rice instead it came with sausage and bacon. I dont like bacon at all. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"Foot Long glorious Bahn Mi.  That's all I have to say!  

Ok - maybe I'll say a bit more!  This place serves up very fresh food, though service can be a little slow.  The smoothie shakes were well flavored, the spring rolls were some of the best I've had, and they were even kind enough to fill up 5 large camelbacks with water as we were heading out of town for the weekend and needed both water and a meal to hold us over on our hikes and the bahn mi hit the spot.  The bread was fresh and flaky, the meat was tender and cut in bite sized pieces, veggies were fresh, and it wasn't doused in too much sauce so it held up excellent for the long road trip and drive.  And size wise... it was so large, it actually lasted for 2 meals, which was soo awesome!!!  Best $5 spent!! :)"}
{"text":"Came here inadvertently and came out as satisfied man. I had the Bun Bo Hue (spicy pho) and it was delicious! The portions of the pork and beef were very generous and the broth is on point. Everything was fresh and tasty, all for a reasonable price. If you are looking for some good pho or Vietnamese or even a good cure for your hangover I would recommend #51 Bun Bo Hue!"}
{"text":"Great late night eats!

The fam & I were out doing last minute holiday things when all of a sudden the 'Hunger Games' hit us like Jennifer Lawrence in a tight top & an even tighter bow string.  Only problem was it was past 9:15 PM, and I was feeling like a sandwich.  But no one besides me would settle for SUBWAY.  Off I go on my Yelp app, plugging in 'sandwich' for a search nearby.  As luck would have it, we were cruisin' along near Chinatown.  What's that you say, Yelp app?  Right off Sahara, a pho place with banh mi sandwiches open till 10 PM?  With over 3 stars?  I'm there!

Getting in front of the place, I thought Pho Vegas was already closed as it was EMPTY.  But upon pulling on the door, I was let in to the awesomeness that is broth simmering on a stove.  Pho broth can be so intoxicating!  I asked if they were already closed and the polite little old lady (our hostess and possibly one of the owners) said, \"No, please sit down.\"  We didn't want to keep them waiting too long for us after closing so we went over the menu as quick as we could.  

We ordered:

*#34 - Pho Vegas Dac Biet ($8.95 for Large) - Special noodle soup with rare steak, crunchy flank, tripe, tendon, brisket, and meatball

#12 - Banh Mi Dac Biet ($5.95) - Foot long sandwich with combination pork

I'm just gonna come out and say the pho and the banh mi were some of the better stuff I've had in Vegas!  Tasty tasty tasty!

The pho was in a really large bowl with enough noodles, goodies, & broth for two of us to share (which we did).  The broth here at Pho Vegas is actually pretty flavorful without being overly salty.  I could taste the star anise, and possibly a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg?  Nice for a cold winter night.  The additional condiments were fresh too, the basil, bean sprouts, and jalapenos were crisp.

But for me, the banh mi was the star!  Each are a foot long!  Bigger than just about all other banh mi offered in Vegas, with similar pricing.  The bread here at Pho Vegas is killer delicious!  Warm, but crusty on the outside & cushy on the inside.  Probably key for a great banh mi.  Some Yelpers complained that theirs were light on the meat, but the one I had that night was on point.  Mayo on the bread as well!  A good serving of fresh veggies in there too - cilantro, cucumbers, pickled carrots & radish.  I added some extra basil, bean sprouts, and a couple of jalapenos from our condiment plate...topped that sucker with a healthy dose of hoisin sauce, a splash of Sriracha, and I was ready to go!  Delicious sandwich!  Shared half with the wifey & she liked it enough that we ordered another one to take home!

I work less than 10 minutes from Pho Vegas so you can be sure I'll be back for lunch to get a banh mi (or 2) to go.  Big bang for the buck!

{"text":"If you're thinking about coming here let me stop you right now. This used to be a really great place but the food quality has gone down hill. The pho is now nothing but a bowl of MSG / Sodium soup that will make you feel sick, dizzy, bloated & parched for gallons of water. They use so much sodium & MSG these days unfortunately I will not be returning again as a regular. There is nothing healthy about MSG. Period.

They messed up on my orders not once but twice the past two times I've visited & have downsized on portions of their meat. I ordered the extra big large bowl Dac Biet & there was only a few pieces of meat floating in it. Bummer! I hate when my favorite restaurants become inconsistent. 
I will be going to back to Pho Sing Sing from now on where the quality & flavors are outstanding but most importantly consistent, without drenching their food in MSG. Sorry Pho Vegas but your quality is gone. You lost a loyal customer forever!"}
{"text":"Food:
Thai tea was pretty good so props, most places somehow always screw making it, like most tea houses back in OC. The noodles were good because there was a lot of fish balls, crab sticks, and other meats. The spring rolls were not the best due to the overstuff of veggies. 

Service:
Really really slow, took forever for one of our drinks to come out, came out almost 20mins later a few mins before the food came out."}
{"text":"From reading all the bad reviews all I saw was people complaining about service. I on the other hand had awesome service. The sandwich was incredible bread was freshly made nice and crunchy texture on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. I had went with my mom and she ordered the chicken salad and vegetarian pho. I had a little bite of it and it was delicious! Broth was a little bland but still delicious! Waitress always came by to fill our cup of water and asked if we were doing ok. So glad I came here with my mom. The waitress also bagged our leftovers for us! You guys are so awesome great place and atmosphere for a nice quiet lunch. Lee is an excellent waitress!"}
{"text":"Pho Vegas has delicious Vietnamese food and great service. Coming from Orange County, my family craved Vietnamese food while in Vegas and this place really hit the spot. They have everything from pho to bun thit nuong and even che ba mau. We'll definitely come back here the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nondescript pho joint in with minimal frills in an unassuming strip mall. I had bun with chicken and eggroll, and it was solid and very reasonably priced. Service was pleasant, but the orders took long enough to tell that they were cooking everything up fresh. 

I would definitely come here again to try the banh mi, as I see here that it comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great place for pho!!! Coming from LA, it is hard to get the broth so good! It is nice and hot! The hot tea is brewed perfectly!!! Amazing staff that is always smiling! Pricing that reminds me of home! My suggestion, try the pho thai, if you want something to get a great soup meal. When i come to vegas going here again!!! :)"}
{"text":"Good pho. Not the best in the city, but consistently good. I've gotten it delivered via delivery services multiple times. I really like their spring rolls as well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time last night and Pho Vegas cannot compare to Pho Mailan on S Eastern Ave.  The Meat & Seafood with Egg Noodle combination soup was oily and the meat was mostly fat.  The curry chicken vermicelli soup was all right.  Overall, we will not return here."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few months ago and ordered the banh mi dac biet and I thought it was ok.  Like many others the flavor of the sandwich tasted like it was missing something, which I could not pin point at the time.  I was so hungry it didn't matter.  So I came back two days ago and ordered the same sandwich and realized what was missing.

No jalapenos, no Vietnamese mayonnaise spread ( I think that is what it's called), and no pate.  I think it's time to move on from this place with the sandwiches for me.  I'll still give them props for having large portions with minimal taste, but I like to savor the food in my pallet and enjoy the exploding favors, which this place completely missed.  

One last note I called the ordered in and they didn't make it untill I showed up and paid. WTH!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food, my boyfriend and I come here very often for the yummy dishes they offer. Unfortunately the owner (the older gentleman) is rude and doesn't know what customer service is. We had placed a online order paying with card, got confirmation saying it would be ready in 45 mins. We drove to pick up our order and when we arrived they told us they never received our order even though the money was taken out. The women up front apologized and said it would be ready in 10 mins. We wait in the car and then check after 10 mins, they say they still need to to prepare the meal. Then the older gentleman that owns the restaurant says they can't complete the order until we pay and that we have to cancel our online order and pay in cash only. We told him that the money was already taken out and that we can show him a statement showing that it was taken, but he continued to argue saying that we never paid and they never took payment. Eventually they called yelp/grubhub and we spoke to josh who told us payment was taken. The older man still did not want to give us our food unless we canceled the online order and payed cash. At this point neither my boyfriend or I wanted to deal with the issue anymore so we just canceled and left. I'm still waiting for the refund and it still shows they took my money from my card so I don't understand why we couldn't have our food, I'm very disappointed because with I love the food here. So overall food is great here but the service is not at all."}
{"text":"Had the rare red meat pho, which was great. The noodles tasted really fresh and the flavors worked well together. We also had the spring rolls with peanut sauce which was delicious."}
{"text":"Brought my grandma for her first pho experience. I hadn't been here before but it was delicious. Prices are the same as everywhere else. Our waitress was extremely nice. My grandma is a vegetarian and she offered to make any adjustments and was super helpful. My grandma got the vegetarian pho with veggies and I got the rare steak. Will definitely be back. Their hours are 10-10 which is great! The broth was amazing, the rare steak was perfect. Zero complaints. Grandma also loved it, I tried hers too and loved it. It's always nice to have a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Took forever but after trying tons of pho restaurants through Vegas finally found this one. We literally order postmates delivery at least twice a week. 
The broth is SO flavorful, no other pho places compare and veggies are always fresh. They have a vegan broth option too which is great for vegetarians. 
I like to check the NV health district restaurant reviews and Pho Vegas got an A+ last time I checked. Highly recommend for authentic pho in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Place had great service and good food!! I love Vietnamese food and my husband and I usually go to pho Kim long but wanted to try a different place and I'm glad we picked here!"}
{"text":"Their broth is hands down one of the best tasting I have ever had! We can't go a week without getting their beef pho special!

This are also one of the only pho joints with a legitimate extra large!"}
{"text":"definitely 
DEFINITELY not coming back. Got 4 cups of ice water and one of them had a cockroach in it."}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner here with my husband. We came in at around 8pm. The lady sat us and got us menus and waters. We decided to have the bun bo hue, a grilled pork banh mi, and the vermicelli with grilled pork, shrimp, sausage, and eggrolls. The food came out pretty fast and the portions are huge! The banh mi and the soup would've been enough for the two of us but I'm glad we tried the vermicelli as well. I know the name says pho Vegas so you'll probably come here for pho, but I really encourage trying the bun bo hue! It's number 51 on the menu. The broth is soooo good! It didn't have as much meat as other places but that broth, oh man! The banh mi was great! The bread was soft and chewy and they were generous with the meat. The vermicelli was delicious as well! I've never tried that dish before and it was really tasty. It's noodles with pork, sausage, eggrolls, shrimp, some veggies, and a side of sauce that you mix in it. The sauce is like the eggroll dipping sauce. If you're not up for soup, try that, it was number 71 on the menu. The service was good. The servers checked on us a couple of times to see how we were doing and refilled our drinks. They were nice and got us a box to go for our leftovers. We left full and happy that we tried this place."}
{"text":"I dropped in for lunch because I was craving a banh mi. The bread is as delicious as it looks, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Sadly, I didn't love the banh mi as a whole. The meat to bread ratio was off and the pate was practically nonexistent. I also tried the bun bo hue. The broth was tasty but the noodles were still hard. Service was painfully slow. Not exactly in a rush to come back."}
{"text":"Had the combination pho, was soooo good. My girl had the shrimp pho. Place was nice & clean.... Definitely will b back when in the area"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. When I moved here from San Diego I tried so many Pho places trying to find one similar to my favorite spot there. The Pho is very flavorful and the rice plates are delicious. I also especially like the egg rolls. Best of all the family that owns the restaurant is very friendly and efficient. This place serves authentic Pho and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"On my quest to find a preferred place for banh mi, I really wanted to like this place.  Unable to decide between a two and three star rating, I decided to go with the latter.  My experience here was probably the poorest service I have received in a long time from anywhere.

I ordered grilled pork banh mi and chicken banh mi to go. All I ordered were sandwiches. That's it.  Thirty plus minutes later, no sandwiches.  The lady who worked there apologized that they were so busy. Okay, fine. After 45 minutes, I got my sandwiches. By this time, I was  hangry. From what I saw, they may have been understaffed, but 45 minutes is unacceptable for just sandwiches. Are they baking the bread?  If so...tell me! I don't think this was the case though.

What is impressive about the banh mi here are the huge portions and freshly baked bread; however, the grilled pork tasted off. I was questioning whether or not I got the right order.  In addition the veggies were lacking the vinegar taste that I am used to.  

I would probably recommend calling in your order, if only ordering banh mi. I don't think I'll be back though.

{"text":"Admittingly anxious stumbling across non-Chinatown restaurants, it is with welcomed arms that Pho Vegas fits a well-needed niche, better-than-average Viet, different from the well established. 

Serving sizes leaning towards large for all things seemingly served, one is not to go hungry it seems with any choice from the menu.  Prices mirror a Chinatown setting.

Starting with the VERY large portioned Banh Mi Thit Nuong, almost twice as large as the norm, announcing fresh bread at first bite.  Charbroiled pork is well seasoned, a bit sweet (almost Tocino like).  A steal at the asking price....Subway, eat your heart out!

Pho Tai is moderately oily, served with delicate noodles, slightly thinner than the average.  Too bad my Rare Beef was already well done when presented, the only note mentionable from a surprisingly satisfying non-Chinatown bowl.  

Lastly, the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio is also large portioned, with more egg rolls I've yet seen served.

Placed in a setting that screams Mom & Pop Hole, I hope for a swift start to their open here on West Sahara. 

Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I am just so upset with changing my rating and not being able to come here anymore. Normal bi-weekly dinner here. Until... Started with a small cockroach on one of the appetizer dishes. Killed it and gave it to the server and said we wanted NEW appetizer (not eaten yet). Then just 10 seconds later, a second cockroach on our plate! Killed it and brought it to the cashiers area. Told them we were leaving. 

  I can't come back here now. I am so upset I have lost my favorite Pho restaurant! Maybe one roach is an anomaly, two is a huge problem. Crawling on the plate!!! So sad."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp pho and grilled chicken with steamed rice.  The broth in the pho was really good and there was an adequate number of shrimp.  The grilled chicken was delicious.  It came with all the sides I expected and delivery was fairly prompt for lunch.  I would order again."}
{"text":"We waited 25 min to order and another 30 min to get two pho even if the place is only half packed. Overall taste is pretty good but I did not mean to stay pho place for more than one hour and half."}
{"text":"one of the,best in the city. the bahn mi With grilled pork is incredible. unassuming little place but it will knock your socks off. I order the small veggie pho and add the raw beef. I have to go at least once a,week. I drive out,in my way to go there!"}
{"text":"Still comparing vermicelli bowls in town, I found myself here. The glowing reviews made me do admit, I must admit.

It's located in an old strip mall along Sahara Ave. The place was empty and the air smelled like old grease - the type that sticks to your hair and clothes, a pet peeve of mine.

Should I get pho? Banh mi? Rice combo? Appetizers? 

Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:
Huge portion. Lots of noodles, egg rolls and meat. However, I was not impressed by the taste of the egg rolls. I didn't like them at all and I just can't figure out what exactly I didn't like about it. Were they fishy and salty? Maybe. I haven't had this dish I did not finish so, this was a first. 2/5

Com Dac Biet:
Steamed rice with grilled pork, sausage, pork cake, and egg. Pork cake? Por que? It's not what you think it is. It's like meatloaf slices made of pork. 3/5

Banh Mi Thit Nuong:
A huge fat sandwich with grilled pork and veggies. Oh my goodness, this thing is thick and delicious. They bake the bread on premise so, when you get your sandwich it is so lovely and warm. You'll ask, \"where have you been all my life?\" Whatever bad things I said in the previous paragraphs, just disregard them. Their Banh mi more than made up for everything. Your first bite, the warm flakey crunchy bread...oh, my! And it's packing some good meat...lots of it. It's just perfection. It's about $6 and it can feed 2 people. Those places that sell sub  sandwiches has nothing on this. 5/5

So, yes, come here for the Banh mi and take it to-go. Skip the egg rolls."}
{"text":"I just ordered the veggie pho from here off Uber eats. Pho was the only thing I could think to stomach after feel very sick all day. I'm super impressed with how warm and fresh everything was when it was delivered. It made me feel so much better and was really delicious! Thank you Pho Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome finally found a spot that serves the sandwich and you can get soup too!! I got 3 bahn mi Togo and a large soup 22$! Awesome food taste good feels good! Gooo !!!.......nvm  this place sux had to chafe my 5 star to 1 star since it took 40 min to make a bahnmi only 2 customers here BOOOOO"}
{"text":"Very good! Had the chicken pho and the broth is delicious. Also tried the egg rolls and they were pretty good too. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The nicest folks run this place! And the pho is pho-ntastic! Had Pho Ga & Pho Tai. Soooo good! Also grilled pork bahn mi is excellent. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. This is the real deal Vietnamese food. Everything looks so yummy on the menu. The very gracious ladies even showed me how to say some Vietnamese phrases! I'll keep coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"New place just opened in Vegas and still finding their was with decor and setup.  The Pho was awesome!   What a great soup base with fresh ingredients for a very reasonable price.  We got an appetizer of chicken wings which were crispy, well seasoned and just plain delicious.  You sure don't go to this place for atmosphere, you go there for the food which is the point of all this isn't it?"}
{"text":"When walking in I was a lil worried since only 2 tables were occupied. I was very wrong to be worried. It was good. 
We ordered a #40 Pho w/ raw steak & meatballs - it was flavorful, hot & deviously spiced, and #71 Bun bowl - well balanced, filling, egg rolls & pork - yummy, sausage- different but not bad. We also ordered a fresh lime drink  and Taro smoothie they were booth +A. You should definitely try them!! 

The staff was friendly and didnt speak much english. But they came by to make sure we were ok. Thats all I ask for in good service.

Overall good food and amazing prices. We will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted Pho but this was not good. The meat was tough and I paid $2 extra for one meatball. ONE meatball! I also ordered the pork plate which was just ok. The egg rolls were the best thing I had and they were just ok too! Very sad the pay over $30 and get this food"}
{"text":"Place to go order really close to closing which I shy away from. Was not a problem. Got there was greeted friendly. Had to wait a few minutes but not terribly long. They separate crisp food from steam which I like. Food was fresh, would like to see more herb especially cilantro but I'm bias to my houston pho home. Still good tho."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 8pm 12/5/15. I ordered a combination pho, combination bahn mi sand which, and my other half got the bun bo hue. 
Our food came out quick! We waited probably about 5-10min at the most. The combination pho was delicious. I had so much noodles and meat that accommodated each other especially for a small! It was mines & my bfs first time trying bun bo hue. So I can't really say much about it besides that it does have a fishy broth to it & thicker and rounder noodles than pho does. The bahn mi was the best I ever had in Vegas. It's so rare to see Vietnamese places serve bahn mi compared to back home (Hawaii) where every Vietnamese place usually has bahn mi. 

Customer service was great! Everyone was very nice! Usually when it comes to Asian joints they don't show much hospitality to their customers but they did. They checked up on us a bunch of times. We were short about 50 cents on our check and they lady said it was ok. 

I will definitely come back here again! I just wish it was closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"Just moved here decided to try this place out. Me and my husband ordered #40 and #50. We had kids with us and they automatically assumed we were going to share our pho with them and brought us extra small bowls and scissors to cut up the noodles. Never have I ever been to a pho restaurant that automatically accommodated to our kids! It was very thoughtful of them! The pho was so delicious and had a lot of flavor! Great place with right prices"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Especially the Pho. Service takes forever and they hardly understand you. But for the price and quality still worth it."}
{"text":"The Pho is amazing here. I got ours delivered to the hotel through GrubHub and the portion sizes were very decent. We got the \"Noodle Soup with White Meat Chicken\", the \"Beef Special Noodle Soup\" & some spring rolls. The broth is super yum and I will definitely be back when I'm back in town. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service super nice!"}
{"text":"Bun bo Hue ( noodle beef Hue) was not good as expected. Not valuable. Delivery on time.
I will try Pho for next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Because we aren't from the area and it had been a long day, my parents wanted comfort food so we checked this place out. It wasn't super crowded when we came in but there were more uncleared tables than tables with people at them. We were seated and warned that the kitchen was understaffed (only two ladies on the floor and they were kept very busy) so the wait would be around half an hour (and it was). I ended up ordering the pho rare steak, tripe, and brisket.

PROS:
- Clean enough looking place with simple and not overbearing decor
- Open late! We came in around 9pm
- Polite staff
- Fair prices that match the portion size
- My mom's dac biet rice meal had a nice variety of sides and each portion was good 

CONS: 
- I barely had a few strands of tripe in my bowl
- The broth seemed more like chicken broth than that of typical pho broth (didn't seem quite right to me since I'm used to more flavorful soup)
- Average enough pho, not going to be memorable but it filled me up"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. The lady who serves there is really mean and if they have more than two tables they will refuse to take order-_- The spring roll was too dry and was not tasty. I don't understand how they can screw up the spring rolls...  Peanuts sauce was way too sweet. It took them over 30 min to make two sandwich:(
And boba was soooooo soggy and bad. Really no texture. They way over cooked them-_- Yikes."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great Pho! The bowl is huge I couldn't finish it... a lot of meat and noddles. My little one loved the fried rice #66."}
{"text":"Good. I want to give them 100000000 star. This is first time I came here. I tried BUN BO, and my husband tried Vermecelli with grill shrimp, bbq pork, and eggrolls. Very DELICIOUS. And the service is very nice. Thank you"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a long day of traveling. Arrived just before closing and were greeted kindly.  The staff was very attentive and the food (pho and bahn xeo) was yummy! Sprouts and herbs were fresh and plentiful. Portions were large. Great find!"}
