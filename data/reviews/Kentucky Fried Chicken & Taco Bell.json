{"text":"What can I say? I love, love, LOVE.. taco! I do prefer a good smokie, but these tacos reminded me of my extended stay in Mexico when I was hanging out with Pedro and Manuel in Juarez! What they showed me in 3 nights in 'room' F-322 and the local 'estación de policía' taught me what a taco should be like! The meat filling was succulent and I was able to enjoy every bite! Truth be told, I couldn't get enough in my mouth! The toppings of sour cream and spicy salsa brings back naughty memories that are best kept secret, but the salad! Oh the salad was to die for! The fresh green lettuce atop of my taco had me wetting my mouth long before I started and if it wasn't for the Dr. Pepper I had, I think I would have just died! The tacos are wonderfully crafted by the finest Filipino hands this side of Mexico!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Taco Bell. Even when it's terrible it's delicious. Two doritos tacos with supreme fries never sounds like a lot, and then i always regret my choices after. Can't seem to stay away though, it's way too delicious.  Also, I've noticed taco bells around the city keep closing. I have no idea why. Do Canadians not appreciate the gift from our neighbours to the south? I think there's like three left now, please don't take them away. Taco time is terrible."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love a KFC and Taco Bell conglomerate?  I mean, you can get your chicken or your tacos!  The choice is up to you!  It's pretty wicked when you can have your choice between the two.  I knew that these two corporations join forces in the mall food courts, but I didn't realize they opened whole stores dedicated to the two.  This place is perfect for me because my boyfriend is obsessed with tacos, but I get sick of them from time-to-time.  And I absolutely LOVE the chicken bowls from KFC.  They are so delicious with popcorn chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, cheese and gravy!  I'm definitely craving one now.  I wish they would open more of these perfect duos of food chains because I think they would do quite well.  Think of it?  Isn't it just a marvelous idea?"}
