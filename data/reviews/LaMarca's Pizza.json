{"text":"We were in North Olmsted with family and decided to try LaMarca's for lunch. We ordered an XL pepperoni pizza, an XL sausage pizza, a large deluxe and 3 lbs of wings. The pizzas were the best we have had in a very long time it was fresh, obviously made from quality ingredients, the amounts of sauce and cheese were perfect and the toppings were delicious!! We also ordered barbecue and garlic butter wings. We ordered them naked (no breading) and they were perfect. They were crispy even in the sauce and the flavors were fantastic. I have never had wings with garlic butter before, but I will have them again on my next Cleveland visit. LaMarca's is a serious contender for a best Cleveland pizza, in my opinion!! It is a must try!!!"}

{"text":"I've known Sal for years;  he's a hard-working guy.  I am on the west side of Cleveland only once in a while (I wish I lived closer to Sal's shop), so when I finished teaching a workshop at Esperanza a few days ago, I called in my order for a PMS (pepperoni, mushroom, sausage), and drove over to pick it up and take it back to my office.  I got into the car with that hot, steamy pizza, and just knew I wouldn't make it, so I ate a slice in the car.  Got back to work and shared it with my assistant and the foodie office folks down the hall, and everyone agrees that this is a goooood pie!  When I'm back on the west side, I'm going back for another.  Maybe two."}
