{"text":"Nexus is truly the best thing to recently have opened in the downtown/East 4th area. As a local clevelander for the past few years, we have needed a spot where people can gather to spend time with friends, read a book, and to also enjoy great coffee (Sumatra). Their coffee and the proceeds specifically helps spread the Christian word to people in another country.   As far as their food, it is definitely 2nd to none in the town where there are numerous great restaurants. I've personally ate crab cake sandwiches, veggie wraps, pizzas, and their panninis leave you wanting to come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago for an iced coffee. It was delicious, price was good and employee was very friendly. Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the coffee roasted beef brisket flatbread and iced coffee. It was really fresh and the cheese was excellent. This place is definitely more than just coffee. The food is fresh and made from local ingredients. The store itself is nice and modern. Staff is Ã¼ber friendly. I am really pulling for this place to succeed."}
{"text":"Great new place in downtown Cleveland.  Awesome food and great service."}
{"text":"Super great lunch. Everything fresh and wonderful tasting! I highly recommend the brisket salad! Delist! Great ice coffee too!"}
{"text":"This place has far exceeded my expectations. The food is amazing and priced just right. All of the menu items I have tried so far have been delicious. Finally, a downtown Cleveland coffee shop/cafe that stays open after the sun sets!!!!"}
{"text":"Only got a latte to go.  The coffee is pretty good but I think the highlight here is the food, which I did not try on this visit.  So the 3 star rating is only for the coffee at this point.  The place was poppin' when I was there.  It must have been around 1pm so all the lunch eaters were there.  Big space with an open kitchen.  The expediter stands at the end of the counter, yelling out orders.  Kinda annoying.  Like one of those things I don't want to hear when I'm trying to think straight or have a conversation with the guy in line in front of me.  Largest size bev is 16oz.  What is the deal with that?  More and more places are giving Starbucks the 20oz and up business.  C'mon!  Anyway, inspired menu choices.  Everything looked delicious and the menu items are creative.  What I like is they donate all proceeds back into a church and the community of Cleveland...bravo.  And they source local ingredients when they can."}
{"text":"Sad face. I just discovered this cafe last Tuesday and then it closed on Friday. Oh Cleveland.  In any case, this place was the first place I tried red rooibos espresso tea. It was...amazingly smooth and so good. They also did the siphon coffee. The barista did it with much skill.   The lunch was very meh. I wouldn't have recommended the vegetarian wrap...no flavor, and it was just a bunch of cold veggies in a wrap.   RIP Nexus."}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a delicious cup of coffee with friends or study. Surroundings nice... Chill music and enough space. So glad it opened up in the area."}
{"text":"Nexus, you're quite alright in my book!   Cheap, healthy lunch options? I feel like that's almost unheard of. Thanks for making it easy to stay on track, body-wise and wallet-wise. They also have some major menu perks worth mentioning. Umm, hello Diet Dr. Pepper and *gasp* Pop Chips! Gah--I love those damn things. You can't find them many places around these parts.   The space itself looks very chill with plenty of eat-in space for business lunchers and spots to post up if you're using it as a mobile office. I also love that you can see your food being freshly prepared. The spinach flatbread was crunchy, melty and pretty darn healthy!   I think my only complaint (and it's minor) is how miserable parking is over there. It's a big reason why I don't visit E4th and the surrounding businesses during the winter months. It's just too hard to find something unless you want to valet or pay and arm and a leg just to park. *Sigh* But this time of year its perfect for riding your bike over, skipping the traffic and parking and just enjoying a good-for-you meal.   I'm already anticipating my return trip... In fact, who's coming with me?!"}
{"text":"Nexus - THANK YOU for providing a yummy breakfast/brunch option in East 4th Neighborhood.  Saturdays venturing to Tremont are fun, but it's nice to be able to just walk to grab food w/ friends.   As for lunch?  Everything is amazing that we've sampled so far.  I recommend the Vegan black bean soup.  Great spice!  I picked up lunch today for a rather picky crowd, and everyone was very excited about their food.  The portions are large, ingredients are fresh, and the price is very reasonable for what you get.  I enjoyed that you are able to watch them create your food in the open kitchen atmosphere.  When I asked for additional this, or could you do that - they were incredibly responsive and friendly!   I jokingly suggested they should do delivery to 668 residents, and the owner said, \"If we're not super busy, of course someone would run something up!\"  Um - YES please!  How amazing - you have some house guests, everyone places their brunch order in, and 15 minutes later it's at your door?  Sign me up!   Check it out - a nice fresh option in downtown CLE!"}
{"text":"I Got The Turkey Pesto Panini. It was Damn good. Price was fair. The Pomme Frites  werem't that great. I also got  the lime coconut bar...It was F\"n Great. The cashier was nice and so was the guy who handed me a menu . but before I came in I didn't get a card from the red head outside. I walked past twice and she never gave me one. It kind of pissed me off becuase I think it was a stamp card or a discount card. I've been there a few time and I spread out menus and such for the people at my office."}
{"text":"Cafe! Yesssssssssss! And it's open late? With a free wifi and good coffee? Yessssssssss! It's about time.  I really like Nexus. Although location itself could be a little problematic, with it being downtown and down the street from the casino, I think Nexus is quite alright.  I've gone here twice and I must say, I really like it. It's pretty spacious, with a couch area with a fireplace, and multiple tables with multiple OUTLETS (yes...outlets!) to plug in your laptop. And it's open LATE. Finally- the late night cafe I'm always looking for! It's so annoying to have to pack up all your stuff at only 10pm at most cafes around here..Nexus is open late! Woot.  And the coffee is good. They actually do drip coffee- real style. Woot! I always get a typical latte, but the brew was good and it's pretty good coffee. I haven't tried the food yet, but hey, if you're a coffee shop with food, it's cool.  I met the owner and he showed me other areas around the coffee shop. There's a 30 person meeting room off to the side, and in the back, there's this huge area that can definitely hold about ~100-150 ppls for future music events, etc. It's cool and hip. I like it.   Looking for a late place to do work? With solid coffee and food? Definitely go to Nexus- no more annoyances with early closing coffee shops with no outlets- just go to Nexus instead! Soooo worth it!  I think what I like the most about Nexus is its drive to connect people in Cleveland. Whether it's using local ingredients, or providing volunteer opportunities to nonprofit groups all while providing part of their profits to local initiatives, truly supporting Cleveland is a mission that I love. And is how we make Cleveland a stronger community to live in. It's what makes us proud of CLE.  So, I support Nexus..and like its coffee here, in the meanwhile too. :)"}
{"text":"I love Nexus! Nice and spacious, comfortable atmosphere, AND open late. As others have already said, it's really cool that this place is open until 9 pm. Really nice place to relax with a coffee, chat with a friend, or do a little work. Stop by and relax a little after work before going to a Tribe game! I've honestly only ever gotten the coffee there, so I cannot comment on the food, but the coffee is plenty good!"}
