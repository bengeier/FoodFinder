{"text":"Located in the Annex, in the middle of Mirvish Village, The Central is a bar, a restaurant, and a live music venue.  The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the \"Draught: Use Your Eyes\" sign behind the bar.  But, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.  The menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.  While the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.  I have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.  I give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu."}
{"text":"Service sucked.  Music volume ranged from 1 to 11 (leave the f-ing knob alone dude!!!!).  For some reason we were cash and carry (and the only two patrons. I now know why)."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection but terrible service. Our waiter was standoffish and pretentious. He took forever to come back to us, and he insulted my friend's choice of drink, forcing her to buy a more expensive one. He also wanted us to start a bar tab with a credit card when all we wanted was a relaxing patio beer on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Also, misleading drink specials -- make sure you confirm before you order. Needless to say I will be going to Victory Caf√© over this dive next time."}
{"text":"I've been to the Central a couple of times, and neither time has it really stood out. Tonight there was only one staffer for the early evening on the main floor, so one guy was tending bar, expediting orders, and working sound. It was a bit much to ask. He did a great job, but it was still too much for one guy working a floor with really dark corners and blind spots.  The food is the real issue, though. I ordered the fish & chips, and the fish was grey and limp and sad. It was breaded like a giant fish finger, and tasted about the same. I ordered the veggie fajitas after that (I couldn't stand to eat the fish), and they were much better. Sizzling peppers, with enough guacamole and sour cream, plus salsa that was actually spicy. If you go, order the fajitas. The poor overworked bartender was really careful to ask me if my order was all right after that, and he was very friendly and accomodating all evening.   The Central is a good place to go if you can't get a seat at the Victory or Pauper's, but it really needs to raise its game in the kitchen to compete with all the other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Another evening, another terrible eating experience on Markham Street.  I don't know if it is me, or that Markham Street is just better to go to for drinks.  It's probably a bit of both.    I went to The Central last night very hungry and looking for a nice patio to have a drink and a meal.  The drinks were fine, but there was but one server running up and down multiple flights of stairs.  He looked exhausted.  The very basic food ordered by me was a veggie burger and sweet potato fries and the chicken wrap by my brother.  We both knew we were not coming for 5-star quality food.  Or service apparently!  We arrived at 7:15 pm and placed our food and drink order by 7:30 pm.  Two tables of couples got up and left because they were tired of waiting.  But I wanted to believe!  The beer came at 7:45 pm (thank god) and dinner arrived at 8:50 pm.  A few pints had made me relaxed about the wait, but it was inexcusable.  They told us the meals were on them because we had to wait for so long.  I was glad because no person should have to pay for what arrived on my plate.  It was a sloppy pile of some kind of mix that was deep fried and plopped out of the bun every bite I took.  My brother's fries were wet and oily and mine were chewy.  How do you screw up pub food?  I will still go back to Markham Street and head directly to the Victory Cafe."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE  PLACE.   Food was awful and expensive.  Drinks and service - the same.   The chef is an arrogant eccentric creep.    He talks like a robot and is VERY condescending.    I will NEVER go back (even if this was the last restaurant on earth).  Restaurant makeover did a great job however the owners arrogant attitude destroyed all good that was done.    Instead of buring their meau on the show they should have done us a favor and burned the entire place down (and not build it back up again).   It's sad when people run a restaurant into the ground, get help to build it up again and become profitable, then run it back into the ground.    The owners (including the arrogant chef) did a good job at doing this.   Do yourself a favor and grab a beef patty and coke and sit in front of City Hall for entertainment.  You'll have a MUCH better time and save a ton of coin.   AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to Victory Cafe for a few drinks. It's a bit dingy downstairs, but the upstairs is large and open with an excellent rooftop patio. The food is also great and very cheap -  a friend had the veggie burger that I sampled, which was great - made in-house from chick peas. The sandwiches also looked good and come with fabulously crispy sweet potato fries. Lots of beer on tap - good service."}
{"text":"Shockingly good food. And not just for a dive-bar.   Influenced by his high-end Toronto kitchen experience, chef James renewed and expanded the menu eight months ago with a focus on fresh ingredients and innovative twists on typical bar-fare. Try the crushed-potato-chip battered Fish and Chips or the tofu Pad Thai (often a terrible choice at a bar, but The Central does it very well). Also recommend the wings -- huge and juicy -- which can give any wings spot in Toronto a run for its money. Order it with a cup of butternut squash soup.    Warning: Make sure James is working before ordering."}
{"text":"Wow, never been to such a bad bar!  I don't know what the deal was, but tonight I went to the Central for a friend's birthday, and this place sucked.  First off, we ordered a pitcher of Mill Street Organic.  The bartender finished the keg, and had to change it.  Once she got back, she filled the pitcher and served us.  There was a strange smell to the beer, and it completely flat.  Tasted as it should, but FLAT! So we explained the situation, and she gave us a new pitcher.  We went for Steamwhistle this time.  The beer was fine this time around, but my cup smelled like a dirty rag that was left overnight to rot.  I brought my glass to the bartender, she smelled it, and even she was disgusted.  She grabbed 2 more glasses (sniffing them) before she found me a clean one, and poured me a new pint.  As for the food.  The 'jalapeno poppers' were not spicy at all, and were in fact banana peppers, and cheese, not jalapeno.  The nachos we ordered (yes, the easiest bar food ever) was supposed to have jalapenos on it, and come with guacamole, salsa and sour cream as sides.  No jalaps, and no guac to be found.  We then asked the waitress again, and she begrudgingly brought us some guac.  Finally, we were in the 'private room' I guess, which is fine for us, except the door to the patio is right there, and is always left open.  So, when you're sitting in the room, you get all the smoke blown back at you from the outside smokers.  You're also not allowed to take drinks outside (which, I understand, sucks for those who smoke).  There is one speaker in the room, and it cuts in and out at random, and at one point it got so loud that no one could hear themselves think!  Overall, I have never been to a worse bar.  The two simple things a bar should do, is have drinkable booze, and decent food, were not even close to happening here."}
{"text":"I've had bad luck with the Other Patio Place on Markham this summer, so I've ended up at The Central a few times. And it's ok. The patio is fantastic - try to sit upstairs, if you can. There's something about looking down on the world that makes everything more exciting.   The beer selection is good. Lots of locals on draft, including a couple from Flying Monkey Brewery (yum!) - this is the only place I've seen the Netherworld Ale on draft, which is delightful. And there always seems to be at least one beer on special - I've never heard of Lighthouse Lager, but I'm sure it's as good as any other dull blonde beer, so why not pay less?  The food is also ok, though I'd steer clear of the nachos. Twice I've ordered them (alcohol makes me forget my previous mistakes) and twice they've been a thin layer of crappy chips topped with marble cheese and served with boring salsa. I had the grilled calamari with salad one evening, and that was good, if a tad overcooked. Still tasty.  And the service... Oh, the service. Terrible. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. I do get beer, sooner or later. Most of the time. But I have to chase the server down to get other things (hot sauce, utensils), and have found the patio servers to be... not, perhaps, the sharpest knives in the drawer. On the other hand, when I've been inside for live events, the service has been somewhat better - still not attentive, but at least not neglectful.   At any rate. This is a fine place to go if The Other Patio is packed and you need to down a cold beer sooner than later. But it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The Central is my kind've place. Very chill and unassuming with a few good brews on tap and a full bar on the main floor if you're looking for cocktails.  The Central has space for any mood: Soak up the sun: main floor patio Live music: main floor inside Cozy with a breeze: upstairs closed-in \"patio\" Rec room: Upstairs on your left with a projector showing the live music from downstairs, a couch area, and large communal tables Private Room: if you have enough people you can completely control the small room with the upstairs bar Outdoors at all costs: If everything else is full, there's a small back patio surrounded by brick  If you're looking for a place to slug back a few with friends or watch some live music or meet some university/college kids, head to The Central for a good time."}
{"text":"I've been to The Central at least a dozen times over the past year to see a friend's shows and I've officially had enough of the place. I'll start with an abridged list of food \"incidents\" I have been served or been witness to.  1. Boneless chicken wings that resemble anemic, greasier popcorn chicken. 2. Poutine with gravy so pale and watery that it soaked the burger bun it was served next to. 3. Chicken wings that are still frozen on the inside. 4. A drill bit in side french fries. Yes, a drill bit. I have no idea what series of health and safety violations had to occur for a drill bit to end up in food.  Most of the time the place is understaffed, but sometimes they're just incompetent instead. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter because I'm still waiting half an hour at the bar to get a pitcher for my table.  The prices are too high for what you get in the service and decor departments, the bathroom makes it impossible for one person to get into the stall while someone else is washing their hands, the beer tastes funny because they don't wash their lines enough, and it's located a stone's throw from half a dozen superior bars. God, I hate The Central.  If you want cheap drinks, go to The Green Room, The Crown and Tiger or Toby's. If you want a casual atmosphere but with decent service, go to Nirvana. If you want good beer and good food, go to The Victory Cafe. Just take it from me: Don't go to The Central."}
{"text":"A good alternative to trying to cram onto the patio at Victory Cafe - definitely make your way up to the patio on the second floor for a nice lofty view of Markham Street. The space here is great (lots of flora and even some Foosball), but unfortunately service is a little lackluster and slow. We were wondering why some people appeared to be simply going to the bar themselves when there was clearly a server on the patio, but I guess after waiting 20 minutes for a pitcher of beer to arrive, I could understand why.   Also, the music is uncomfortably spastic. We covered country, dirty south hip hop, Buddha Bar, latin, piano jazz, indie, and hair metal all in one sitting. Despite all this though, hey, a nice patio is sometimes all you really want and The Central has got it. So suck it and your beef with country music up and just be grateful you've even found a patio with alcohol."}
{"text":"Found atmosphere hippy like, dark dirty & dingy @ 1pm. Try their sat. Afternoon what was suppose to be a big buffet waffles pancakes was deplorably unsatisfactory. 2 pieces of dry cold tasteless pastry pancakes, runny water down tasteless maple syrup $7.95?!!! Tea $2.65?!!! Served by drafty windows. Since it was for a private crowd where was the warming trays? Also, this private event was planned at least 10 days ahead for a private award winning  movie viewing, they failed on that issue as well. They have bank seats & regular cushioned chairs ( ALL COMPLETELY UNCOMFORTABLE for more than 30' of sitting. Nobody was sitting by the bank seats except by 2 ind. )  During our/my eating, they asked me to move completely from my chair so projections steps above my head could be made before the actual movie is shown. The actual viewing of movie was not clear but smudgy like. Just completely Unprofessional and inexcusable.    Funny thing was I was suppose to attend to this venue 3 yrs ago, but unsuccessful attempt and felt disappointed. QBottom line met 3 people out of 35.  Couldn't get there earlier and would have. It's a formally dark narrow old house, open up from front to back on main floor. All hospitality orders cooking bar on the main central floor.  On the second flr, I didn't use but I did use the washroom. 2nd flr, There are areas section up for dinning. I expected a better nicer concept place but it's cater to younger perhaps students and small bands. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Popular U of T student hangout. Unique beer selection including an alcoholic 4% ginger beer from the UK which I haven't seen anywhere else.   The staff (wherever they were) are virtually hiding from you. We had a group of 8 people and had to trek up and down the stairs to give out individual orders and pay for it up front.   It's kind of moldy smelling place - I prefer the upstairs which a bit like an attic with a large patio. And they played film noir with subtitles while we were there on a projector screen. I'd go here if Victory Cafe next door was too full or closed."}
{"text":"Likeaphenomena ( the girl who knows good food and beer) describes The Central as a small, dive-bar hang-out that has its own certain set of fans (who like small, dive-bars hang-outs)    From my own visit, I'm not one.  The server warned me that the kitchen was slow that day.  Sure enough my order of poutine took just over an hour to arrive to the table and tasted horrible.  The selection of beers on tap is limited."}
{"text":"great bank and activites always fun to hang there a little tight i like the darkness :)"}
{"text":"Forgot a bag here last night. Contacted the manager and was advised to text him the description. After texting him 4 times in the span of a day to find out if it was there or not (with no reply) decided to just go and get it. When picking it up, the bartender was extremely rude. I saw the bag behind the bar and had to tell other staff members (not the bartender) where it was and that it was mine. After inspecting the bag I found that a pair of dress pants had been removed. Had a great night at this bar but after that, I would not return. Very poor customer service in regards to an issue that would have been a very quick fix anywhere else."}
{"text":"Situ√© juste √† c√¥t√© du Honest Ed, le Central accueille g√©n√©ralement des com√©diens en herbe pour des soir√©es stand up. Le plus ici repose dans la terrasse qui est litt√©ralement prise d'assault au premiers rayons de soleil. Id√©al pour les groupes voulant un endroit pour se retrouver et passer un bon moment.  Located just next to Honest Ed, the central usually hosts comedians wannabes for stand up events. The bonus here is the patio which is litterally packed with the first days of spring. This is definitely a good place for groups to gather and have a nice time with few drinks."}
{"text":"I suppose we had the unfortunate experience of choosing to go to the Central on a Sunday afternoon for our first impression of this bar.    The service was absolutely terrible. Although we had a table we were not approached. It took a while of awkward glances from the kitchen to get attention at the bar. The drink menu on display had incorrect prices. It said 5$ pints Sunday for the drink special. I was told that's actually not true.    I chose the house beer which was actually really quite good. My friends ordered cocktails that they liked as well. We were planning on ordering food but after my drink was poured I was informed that the kitchen \"was out of everything\". Too bad.   In conclusion, great for drinks. Don't expect helpful service. Probably great party venue at night."}
{"text":"Dive! Dive! Looking for this watering hole just off Bloor St. behind what was known as Honest Ed's, I noticed their address 603 Markham St. was reflected in the blue street sign adorning the corner right at Bloor. That means right next to the corner, not counting Honest Ed's. A few steps up, and... there it is, a dingy spot to whet your whistle. The first floor has a small stage at the back where some brave souls were strumming guitars and a bar that has a few select beers on tap seemingly running strong, cold and fresh from the kegs below.  There are random tables and chairs to assembly any way you wish right at the front with a good view to look down as your friends show up at the bar or have a smoke outside. Then, upstairs has another space which, at the time, was being used for some kind of a reading, so keep that in mind that The Central hosts groups of people engaged in stuff. Each area of the bar has a different smell, grungy and reeking of spilled beers from days gone by. A patio off the back is covered in broken chairs and trash as if a party happened at some point and the place never really recovered. An excellent spot to meet up for drinks before a show at an equally divey Toronto hallowed institution like Lee's Palace, or the Bloor Hot Docs Cinema nearby."}
{"text":"Sadly this is one of those places that just can't seem to get their act together.  I mean on paper The Central looks great. Two stories high, two patios, and lots of different bands and comedy shows. They could be like a Baby-Tranzac. Heck they even have cheap drink specials every week. $4.50 pints on a Friday night? Having said that, nothing that I have seen here in the sense of food would ever inspire me to eat here.  However the bands are horribly advertised, same goes with their other shows which some of them could be quite good, but you would never find out about them if you go by their spartan, never updated  website.   So whenever I have been there I have had the impression that most people in attendance are not actual customers but family/friends of the bands/acts themselves. I brought a number of people to the Strip Comedy a few weeks ago. A show where bad jokes are rewarded with the comedians having to strip a piece of clothing...! Although the premise is unique and well, funny, most of the comedians were embarrassingly bad so the entire show is about half-cooked -plus in case you were asking, most are not worth seeing even remotely naked.  Plus on the previous show two of my guests got heckled by a sad \"comedian\" just because we would not laugh at his horrible jokes. The hostess of that show apologized for his rudeness but still this does not speak well for the venue in general.     Also, you get the vibe that this place is very disorganized. For example, a while ago, I was there with 8 friends, we had been drinking for hours, having a blast when all of the sudden --and without warning, we were being asked to pay if we wanted to stay, since a band, that had not been advertised --as I checked their website (which generally is awfully outdated both in design and calendar listings) was about to perform and wanted their money. We were like, \"we have blown through some cash here and now you are telling us to pay up or leave?\" Yup. So we walked out. Went down to the bar at the end of the street.   Would I come here again? Maybe during the Summer for a quick pint outside in the patio where I would not get charged to get in case they had a band or if there was a large party already happening. However Victory Cafe down the street falls under the same lines in decour yet it is superior in almost every way."}
{"text":"We had the misfortune of ordering from The Central via OrderIt.ca. What an awful experience. The food was mediocre at best. It arrived wrapped in tinfoil almost 2 hours after we placed our order.   The descriptions are misleading, items were not delivered with the sauces they were supposed to come with and 1/3 of our order simply wasn't delivered.   I realize that The Central is a bar first but if they are going to exist on a takeout website, they should at least have containers for their food.  This was the first and last time I will ever order and I hope no one else ever makes this mistake."}
{"text":"I'm with Marissa...I was here for the same thing and getting around was, well, it was easier to stand out in the rain for a bit than try to move around in the bar.  And this may be the beer talking, but that burger is dreamy.  There are plenty of great burgers around here, but I wish I could get a burger like that at home.  I'll be seeing you World Champs weekend 2009, Central Burger."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone somewhere, expecting that you'd been there before, but then arriving and realizing that this was definitely not the place you thought it was? Well now that I've set the scene of my arrival, lets get down the the details.  First impressions are of a divey student pub. Patio out front, main floor seeming to be the most fit for live music with a stage. The main floor bar is stocked pretty well with a variety of craft and big brand beer options ($7.75 for a pint of Hopsta La Vista, as example), and on this night they were serving 3oz cocktails for about $11 if memory of what my friend told me is correct. Upstairs you'll find the bathrooms and a couple of other rooms for chilling in, which had a fairly large cross section of demographic in age. While they were charging a cover in the main floor, it seemed anyone could go upstairs to drink and not be there for the main floor event in question.  One thing I noticed was the place definitely seemed to be run a little thin in terms of staffing. The night I was there apparently the sound guy was also the bartender so when there was an issue with sound while transitioning between acts and no one seemed to know what to do. When the sound actually was working it seemed decent for the size of venue. So when it comes down to it, the place doesn't seem without its divey charms, and I'd imagine if I was hypothetically in a local college band hard up for gigs, I'd be pretty okay with playing the place, so 3 stars seems about right in the end of this review."}
{"text":"I came to this bar to support a friend's band playing at this venue. From the outside, the patio seemed very nice to drink and eat at. I have passed by this bar to go to the comic book store thinking that. When I finally went in, I was severely disappointed at the state of the interior. The whole venue smelled like a washroom stall. All of the furniture and stage equipment were just a slapdash of mismatched parts added throughout the years. It was cramped, all the tables were wobbly. I did not trust the food that came out of the lower level kitchen. I ordered the red lantern drink since I was taking up space there. I thought the drink was a pitcher for people to share but looked like it was for one person. It tasted nice and fruity but I didn't like the hard old gummies. Anyways, I was glad to leave ASAP"}
{"text":"Central is on the same stretch of evening/night spots as Victory Cafe, and as a result isn't always filled.  However, it's 2 patio spaces (ground floor and 2nd floor) saw it's popularity steadily grow this summer.  With reasonably priced food and drinks as well as a good staff, this place deserves the good reputation it has earned.  They'll sometimes have Jazz or some other live music playing inside, but I'm not convinced it happens with any frequency.  Of all their different dishes, my favourite is the grilled vegetable sandwich.  It's actually amazing, and with a beer it's a perfect late lunch on a warm day."}
{"text":"Not sure what to make out of this place marijuana is smoked police show up from time to time I have no clue what's brewing inside"}
{"text":"It's small and needs a serious face lift.  Drinks are cheap, selection is minimal.  I do not plan on visiting ever again."}
{"text":"Jack of all trades: Dive bar edition.   The Central has random programming... comedy shows, concerts, and even chess nights. Every night seems to have a different theme and mojo.  The Central first caught my eye due to the spillover effect from Victory Cafe. Victory's service and slow moving patio can sometimes be a pain... why bother when you can just go next door to Central?  Don't expect a lot from the service. At times, they are severely understaffed. Help yourself.  It's a fairly big venue, so it's a strong choice for groups.  If you're looking to impress someone with service and atmosphere, go elsewhere. This spot is  perfect for random hanging out, drinking, and having conversations all of types."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  I came here looking for a nice, chill and intimate place to hang out with some good friends.  The setting is pretty nice, can't say much about the drinks but if you're looking good, wholesome place for a drink, come here to the Central."}
{"text":"WRPS had our players reception here the other night.  Most of us were some form of out of towners, but a great staff, cold beer, and delicious food made sure that the night was enjoyed by all.  I just wish that the bar itself were a little longer, or the pathways a little wider... when this place gets crowded, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get from one side of the bar to another!  Probably the best $7 hamburger I've ever had, easy."}
{"text":"I went here to watch my friend play a show. A little cramped, but has outdoor and upstairs seating. The food was surprisingly good and the drinks are cheap! Will definitely be going here again, whether or not my friend is playing :P"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting for eating and drinking at. It smells like urine everywhere in the venue. The tables are sticky and don't look clean. And the ventilation is just pretty bad when you have a bunch of people inside.  It took a while for someone to come by to take our order. Practically nobody came by until we saw someone try to clean a table after some patrons left. We wanted a drink, so we asked him if we could order, but he gave us this look like, yeah I'll take your order, but I don't work here Lol. Whatever, he eventually came back with our drink but he made the transaction process so awkward. So the deal is, you order a drink and when it arrives you pay him immediately... unless you want to make a tab. The drink was not as big as we thought it would be for 10$ - it came in a small/mediumish mason jar. This place is quite pricey for drinks.  Anyway, would not recommend coming here. It was really not clean, after leaving, I had a strong urge to want to shower. The only worthwhile thing here is the live music."}
{"text":"I had an excellent time at the Monday night comedy show/ open mic! Comedians were HILARIOUS..especially Stephanie Tevlev. The prices for food and drink were good! Got a veggie wrap and vodka soda for $12. Its divey, so dress casually. Also, surprised how they allowed hecklers.  Ladies were rude to comics and was certain someone would say something but staff did nothing."}
{"text":"A little better than standard pub food in terms of food options, with several pastas, polenta, pad thai and fajitas on the menu.  But for the love of god stay away from that veggie burger. Being a vegetarian I didn't have very high expectations of the veggie burger at a place like this, which is why I didn't order it, but my friend did. And let me just say that the \"burger\" was basically just a soggy greasy deep fried  pile of mush. Sooo greasy, you can't imagine!!! *bleh*. I had the grilled veggie sandwich (a bit better) and my other friends had some buffalo chicken wrap which they said was really good. The sweet potato fries were good, but if you mess those up, then you have real problems. I dig the atmosphere as they have two rooms upstairs where you can socialize in a larger group, but one room doesn't have any music, which is a bit strange.  The patio has real potential for the summer time. So I'll be back but I'll be trying the pastas next time instead. Or maybe I will just drink booze and skip the food altogether...  oh ya and the food is VERY reasonably priced....  p.s FREE foosball!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The bar was decent enough but what I completely disliked was being swindled by the bartender at the second floor bar who double charged us for drinks.  You can recognize this loser bartender - he thinks he looks like Ryan Gosling and is under the impression that he is way more charming and attractive than he really is.    The bartender talked us into ordering shots, which is fine, but then knowingly took money from both my sister and I (we didn't know the other had paid) for the same drinks.  My friend told me he later bragged to the other scrawny bartender for doing that- she didn't know he was talking about us.  This completely left a bad taste in my mouth about the bar.  If management would like to know who this guy is, we actually have a picture with him.  I would just warn all other patrons going to this bar to not trust any of the bartenders as this is shady and reflects poorly on the bar in general.  EDIT: The manager (maybe owner) Lucan, contacted my sister after she complained and offered to reimburse us and apologized graciously.  He stated that the bartender would be reprimanded.  It was extremely kind of him and so I've changed my review.  Excellent customer service on Lucan's part."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a weeknight.  There are several rooms here, including an upstairs. The bar downstairs is pretty small. I felt that the place as a whole was somewhat cramped.  Drink prices were average. No complaints about the staff.  There was free live stand-up comedy the night I went. It was so-so, as is usually the case with bar shows. I'm sure it's better on some nights.  I might come back once in a while.  Tip: the stall in the men's bathroom is unbelievably cramped! Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! What did the lawyer say to the musician? \"I know it's kinda random, but whaddaya say we open a bar?\"  There's no punchline, but this is apparently how The Central, as we know it, was conceived. Two hip college friends, a little bored of what they were most familiar with, decided it would be fun to play bartender at night while taking care of their other gigs during the day! The eccentric owners alone have gained an extra star for Central in my book because chatting with them has reassured me this is the laid-back, no non-sense place I like to get a drink! The design is yet another transformed Victorian house with diverse rooms. The main bar is in the downstairs area and this is also where a small stage is setup for musical performances. The second floor includes two cozy rooms (one with a foosball table), and a balcony-patio that is an ideal place to have a drink during the summer.  I'm not familiar with the exact schedule, but there are drink specials depending on the weeknight. I remember that during the summer their 'well rum' was Havana Club and it was a pleasure to know you could order round after round of the good/better stuff without putting a hole in your pocket.  The food options are also decent and served in large portions. Nothing too exciting to write about in this department as expected with most bars!"}
{"text":"Treats bands like meat.  Be warned if you're thinking of playing here.  They'll cram 10 bands in one night resulting in nowhere to sit.  Service is horrible too, pretty much have to serve yourself."}
{"text":"Sarah L and I have never had a bad time here. For some reason we often end up here when no one else is around, and one or more of us has a laptop, and we get to drinking, and five-way-Skyping and incredible times ensue.  Or we'll show up and and before we know it we were knee deep in a fundraiser featuring stand-up comedy. This kind of thing happens a lot at The Central where there is something going on almost every night. Live music, comedy, parties, DJs, what-have-you is always on the schedule.  Downstairs features a diminutive bar, their main dining space and a little stage (where the aforementioned comedy took place) for gigs. Upstairs features a more chill space with loungy area with couches and a TV. I believe there is also a patio up there, which combined with the large streetfacing patio brings their count to TWO. Impressive.  The foodstuffs are surprisingly decent and reasonably pricied. I remember the dip platter being more food than any quantity of people could handle and being delicious too. Hoorah!  Obligatory Title Pun: This place is in the MIDDLE of all the action.  Menu Readability: It's ALL right. I like the use of black stock.  Need to mention: They have Amsterdam, Wellington and Creemore Springs on draught. Pints are $5.  What this place teaches me about myself: The formula for fun is Sarah L + Laptops + Beer."}
{"text":"I really don't think the Central gets enough credit, and that probably comes from being situated near the Victory Cafe (tried and true and popular). However, I feel like The Central is more than just an alternative. It's pretty great in its own right!  Lots of patio seating which is essential in the summer. The main floor inside is pretty long and narrow but there are a few rooms upstairs as well, which I believe are available if not being used for a private function. The food is great, the drinks are better! You've got all your standards plus a few pleasant surprises (Manatoulin Island Iced Tea anyone?). Good music and friendly staff.   I've also been here a few times for live shows and had a great time, it's a great venue for bands."}
{"text":"It's alright - the patio is awesome but I don't stay long, often just meander down the street to Victory."}
