{"text":"Love the service. Love the food! Pizza is amazing. The cannolis are to die for. I gained major poundage on that alone. Do not miss this family bakery. It is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for this place, so stopped by for lunch with my sister on a weekday back in June. We weren't super hungry so we got an Eggplant Lasagna ($6.50), a Meatball ($2.00), an Arancini ($2.99), and an Apple Turnover ($1.75) to share so we could try a little bit of everything.   The eggplant lasagna was sooo good. My sister and I both loved it and couldn't get enough! It was like many thin layers of eggplant parmesan stacked on topped of each other. The eggplant was so meaty in texture I didn't even remember it was meatless. It was also surprisingly filling too, which I didn't expected. We liked it so much, we went home and looked up recipes to try to recreate it, but it was too much work. Next time we'll just come back to get it instead! The apple turnover was very flaky and not overly sweet. The meatball and arancini were both good, but I've had better elsewhere.    This seems like a cute little place. They have a few tables at this little shop for eating in. The hot tables items makes for a quick, cheap lunch. I'll definitely be back for more of the eggplant lasagna and to try some other items as well!"}
{"text":"This place is a little Italian gem in Markham.   It's one of those places that I've driven by many, many times but never took the chance to go in and actually check it out. The interior takes you away into this other world of an Italian mom and pop shop that has been there for over 20 years.    They have fresh baked goods (variety of cannolis, red velvet cupcakes, cakes etc), a hot plate area if you're craving lasagna, pasta, chicken parmigian, etc and sandwiches.  In the back there are baskets of bread to bring home, along with olive oil and Bristol coffee (whole bean, ground coffee etc).   Since I came here after a large lunch, I got a couple of small baguettes ($0.75/each) to eat later and had a coffee flavoured cannoli ($2) to eat in the bakery.  Delicious and fresh. The ricotta filling was light with a bit of coffee flavour and the cannoli pastry was crisp as opposed to chewy so I knew it wasn't sitting there for a few days.   They also have this awesome looking espresso machine that I've never seen before. I \"google imaged\" espresso machine and the first name I could find for it was \"traditional espresso machine\".  Cool, that works for me.  I'll have to come back and try out their latte or cappucino ($3).  Excited to try it out!"}
{"text":"I too am shocked by the 3 star rating, because the wood oven pizza's got to be the best in Scarborough, by far.  Remezzo's is good, but they don't make thin crust pizzas like the kind you can get at Il Fornello or Terroni downtown.  And these pizzas are only $10!  In addition to pizza, we also ordered a macaroni and cheese and lasagne from the hot food section, and it was also very good.  It was far better quality than Pizza Pizza or what you would get at Metro.  Honestly, it's probably better than what I could make at home as well lol.  Would definitely go back on a Thursday or Friday, since those are the days they make pizza.  Just wish I'd discovered this place sooner, since we only live about 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"I just came here last week. I had an Cafe Americano and it was really good. Can't wait to come sometime to try their pizza for dinner and try some baked good as well. They all look really delicious!!!!!  Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"We have been going to this bakery for a very long time and it never disappoints. When we eat breakfast, we usually order the croissant, the chocolate donut, and the cannoli. The croissant is always crispy and buttery. The donut is always soft, and if it is fresh, the chocolate is not completely dried, leaving it nice and sticky. The cannoli crust is crunchy, unlike the cannoli at Cannoli Queens. The ricotta or cream filling is nothing special, just average. For lunch we order the lasagna. The tomato sauce is really good and the layers have just the right texture. The meat, however, is a bit bland. Service is friendly, but the bathrooms are a bit on the dirty side. Despite this, I encourage everyone to try this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place nearby that sold pumpkin pie by the slice and happened to hear about this bakery. To my surprise it was so close to us! It's a nice little place which seems to place a lot of quality in their food. The first bite of the pumpkin pie tart was unforgettable! The price was amazing for the quantity and quality of it. The decor feels very homely and they have done an amazing job with the halloween theme! I definitely want to come back and try a meal here."}
{"text":"Calabria is open in Markham. The new location is Hwy 7, by Galsworthy."}
{"text":"It's a great place for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea. Fresh, tasty, home cooked Italian food, fresh breads and pastries, freshly brew coffees, reasonable price. Friendly staffs, been here many years, never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for the price! I love their wood fired pizza on Thursdays and Fridays. The Calabria, with its spicy kick and salty pancetta, is quite tasty. You can order stuff that's not on the list too, like a Meat Lovers pizza. My tip is to call in advance so they can get it going before you come in... It tends to get quite busy as everyone loves their pizzas.   They've also got a good selection of savoury stuff like pasta (which changes often), roasted vegetables, different proteins (I saw roasted rabbit, sausages, deep fried fish, veal, etc) and desserts like the classic tiramisu. For the price, it's unbeatable!"}
{"text":"2.5/5  I love desserts and pastries. On my visit here in January I was a little underwhelmed to say the least .   I guess I was expecting too much ( I imagined canolis, those tri coloured almond cookies, and other Italian goodies). I tried instead a latte which was alright and a cupcake. Or maybe I went on a bad day.   The cupcake apparently is from the Cheesecake Factory in the states. I love the Cheesecake Factory, but if I had talented staff--- which I'm sure they have. I'd make Cupcakes with an Italian spin in house (cannoli cupcakes, baccio, nuttella etc).Not cupcakes that taste frozen and like they've been shipped around.   I will visit again, but only to give it last try because I was sorely disappointed in the desserts. Service was good.  To be fair they seemed to have a few savoury options and decent seating for a small bakery. MAybe I'll try a dish made in House.  I can only hope that the American Italian bakeries I've visited in America with cakes/pastries galore make it to Canada."}
{"text":"I had the veal lunch combo with broccoli and saut√©ed peppers. Great service, very filling and tasty meal. The pizzas looked really good too, so I'll probably come back for the pizza at some point. Great for lunch and they've also got a large selection of pastries that look very good too."}
{"text":"Nothing was available! Don't be misled by their website/menu items. Their hot foods and bread shelves were pretty must cleaned out both times I was there! Zero pastries and desserts. Why have a menu at all if 95% of the posted stuff isn't there? I have tried there both in the late morning and in the afternoon, so the time of day could not have been the cause. The PLAIN bread that I managed to find turned out to be extremely HARD and SALTY. I can't figure how plain bread could be salty, however the last piece of Veal that I picked up tasted pleasant. Still, It was a waste of effort and gas to even drive there since nothing else was available. So frustrating, never coming back."}
{"text":"Turnover is really really fresh .very good coffee. Fresh pizza must try. Friendly service"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for at least 10 years.  This place had a wood-fired stone oven for baking Pizza pies.  Well, it's still here!!  The downside is the oven is only fired up for lunch on Thursday's and Friday's so I had to settle for something else.  My take-out dinner was a $7.50 Veal Sandwich on a round Kaiser bun with peppers, onions, mushrooms and extra sauce.  I added a $2.50 Arancini which is a rice mixture rolled into a ball with mozzarella, sauce and peas in the centre and then coated with bread crumbs before frying.  How can anyone go to an Italian bakery without buying a Brio soda and a $3.50 decadent dessert?  Not me!  It's my reward for returning home after a long absence.  Total bill was $17.45 which was reasonable for my evening treat tonight.  If I had the time, I would have stayed and ate my delicious meal in their large seating area.  I will return for my Pizza Pie!!"}
{"text":"Very helpful and straight to the point service that helped me immensely when I required their catering service.   I was held with the responsibility to order on behalf of 21 people for a work luncheon. The general consensus was we want Italian. I looked it up and it seemed as Calabria had very fair prices for quality products.   The food was delicious and the lady on the phone who helped me order was honest- which is rare. As most people who find out this is catering for a catering even drive up the price. She understood that in a work environment there are people with different pallets and restrictions and suggested that the bacon bits be on the side. She advised they don't have hot sauce but to have grilled peppers would do the job.   She advised that I should order a day before and when I went to pick up the items. My order was packed and ready to go. We all loved the eggplant parmigiana lasagna and the chicken cutlets. The vegetarians were a little skeptic to try out the Arincini I ordered for them but they loved it after.  Overall the food was absolutely delicious and everyone was very satisfied. Sorry for the non creative review on their catering. However- I am full and mellow at the moment."}
{"text":"We came here twice today because we just couldn't wait another day to visit!  The first time we went in, we had cappucino and biscottis, a very satisfying combination! We saw their hot food section and we knew we had to come back.  And half an hour later, we were there again! We ordered a pasta with mushroom, rapini, and brussel sprouts on the side and a meat lasagna with rapini. The menu did not list how much it costs to add veggies on the side, but the total was around $17 which was a little pricey. I wish they would a bit more clear with their prices. The veggies were cooked well and the pasta was simple, yet flavorful. The lasagna was pretty good, except the tomato sauce was a bit too sour and overpowering.   All in all, Calabria Bakery is an authentic Italian restaurant with food that is delicious, comforting and will leave you hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The penne was SOOOO salty, my colleague could not finish it.  I tried it too, and I agreed,  had it not been oversalted, it would have been tasty. I ordered the chicken with mushroom sauce, and the chicken was rubbery and hard to cut, and the gravy was also too salty.  We tried the pastry for dessert.  The chocolate eclair was \"greasy\" & left a pasty taste in your mouth, and again, my colleague ate half her canneloni and didn't finish it.   She said the filling was too sweet.  We had wanted a \"home cooked meal\" which was what we thought we'd get, but the quality of the food is not good.  Prices are low, but I'd rather pay more and get a satisfying meal.  The interior is also shabby and the TV was blasting, but with a big sign on it saying  \"Do not touch TV.\"     Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"It is too bad that they only do Pizzas in their stone oven on Thursday and Fridays because they are incredible. This place is only good for lunch as they only make tasty food only once in the day so go early for great selection. Each day there is a new menu so you pretty much have to go each day.  They also have very, very good pastries and baked goods."}
{"text":"This place only has a 3 star rating?!?! I came here because my coworkers were telling me how tasty their pizzas are. I paid $9 for a pepperoni and cheese pizza fired in a wood fire oven, which is a decent deal to me. It is a pretty decent size so i could only eat half. The crust is not quite as thin as mama's pizza, but i love how the pizza is made fresh to order. They only use the wood fire oven on Thursdays and Fridays so plan your trip here accordingly!"}
{"text":"Boy the markham location is so different as opposite to this location. You can order pizzas only on thur or fri but today was my lucky day. Dumbfounded, the bitter old man looked at me as if I was lucky to taste his pizza. Not knowing the best pizza or how to order, he looked at me as if I walked off a space ship pointing at his pen to write down the order. I could have walked off with it as they were so stupid in not noticing. After waiting to pay, I realized this better be more than decent. It was to be honest, it was not worth the hassle to settle into some dumpy old fashioned restaurant with less than gratified staff."}
{"text":"Calabria Bakery is a Markham gem. Their cannolis are to die for, in that soft creamy and not so sweet sort of way that induces pangs of nostalgia for a Sicilian vacation. Their filling takes me back to a trip in Cefalu (Palermo) where I sat sipping on my espresso, eating my cannoli and thinking bad thoughts about kidnapping one of those 50 Vespas lined up outside the shop for a very long joy ride.     So Calabria definitely gets the job done in terms of authenticity. Their food selection, aside from espresso and cannolis, extends to wood-fired oven pizza, fresh pasta, veal parmigiana and tons of pastries.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's always best to have a great food and talk about Australia with the owner here . best food and pastry in the region. definitely recommended and simply their chicken Parma is the best !"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch with my coworkers and we all love it!    Pros:  - Service: Service is fast and the people who work there are very friendly. If you don't like a certain topping or only want a little, they always do it for you which is very kind  - Food: The wood oven pizzas are made fresh to order on Thursdays & Friday's which is great. (Get the Calabria pizza)  - Price: Very affordable pricing for the food you get. It's like getting a home cooked meal - Parking: Tons of parking in the lot.   Cons:  - Decor: I personally don't love the decor, wish it was renovated to have a new look     Get the Calabria pizza! You won't regret it, so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Got a salted caramel ice cream and also a strawberry ice cream. $5 each for small. They ran out of small cups so they filled the large cup only half way. But the lovely lady didn't just stop half way. She filled it almost all the way up. I felt like I was eating a large ice cream. I loved the salted caramel flavour. It actually tasted like the name suggested. Also got a vanilla meringue and a slice of chocolate cake. The meringue was nice and light and airy. Very yummy. The cake while looked very good tasted only okay.  There were a few seats inside but it was packed. Good thing they had one table outside so we opted for that.   Service was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"Simple food at fair prices. Too bad the the Wood Fire pizza is only Thursday and Friday because they would make a killing if it was offered more days. The ordering system can take some time to do. But it works for them so why fix what's not broken. Also the cashier is on the rude side.....just saying."}
{"text":"Just go for the made to order pizza. The hot prepared food section looks pretty unremarkable, but the pizza is fresh, tasty, and a great deal for $10. It's a thin crust pizza, but the crust still holds up to all the toppings and even when reheating it later, the crust didn't collapse like some do. I had to ortolano which is all veggies, and the variety and freshness of the toppings was great. I really liked the smoky eggplant and zucchini. You can ask for a bit of spice and they add chili flakes -- so good! I would say the pizza is good for 2 hungry people."}
{"text":"Calabria is a true \"tavola calda\", certainly a gem for simple but good Italian food. Located in a plaza, Calabria offers hot Italian dishes served cafeteria style, baked goods and pastries, espresso drinks, and wood-oven pizzas. I have been there many times as it is quite convenient to pick up some dinner on my way home. My favourite is the meat lasagna: layers and layers of perfectly cooked noodles, meat, sauce, and cheese perfection! Also, Calabria is a great location to find those delicious speciality panettone around Christmas time. This place is a MUST try!!!"}
{"text":"The good: Quick service   The BAD: The food! Had a veal sandwich that was awful tasting and cold."}
{"text":"This place is great! I stop in here when I have to take care of business at Service Ontario. The moment you walk in, a wonderful smell greets you at the door.  Their display of desserts and baked goods is such a tease. Everything looks SO delicious that it's dangerous to go there on an empty stomach! Donuts, croissants, cannoli, cupcakes... Nothing was disappointing (and yes, I tried them all).  They have a hot table area as well which I have yet to try, and believe me - I will! The service was excellent - friendly, smiling faces behind the counter make it all the more inviting.  The space is small and cozy, and there are tables to eat at or have a coffee. This place is a hidden gem, and almost makes it worth having to wait in line at Service ON so that you can treat yourself afterwards!"}
{"text":"It is not closed.  They moved down the road to Galswothy and Hwy 7. The pizza and calzones are great and I love their veal sandwich."}
{"text":"i ordered a lasagna with a side of mixed veggies and had a lime drank to quench my thirst. i liked the mushrooms the most out of the veggies.  the lasagna was excellent. lots of layers. saucy and soft. sometimes you get lasagna and there is cheese that's been melted on top but then it hardens and a kinda gross cheese layer on top. you don't get that here. you can cut through it easily from top to bottom with just a fork. it was quite filling and for those who have a sweet tooth, you can get some baked goods/pastries or gelato. i'm sure i'll be back to try those some time."}
{"text":"I drove by McCowan and Hwy 7 where Calabria Bakery used to me and I found out it is gone.....  No, it didn't closed down!! The whole building structure is gone!   Now it is a construction site and I couldn't find an update at their website...   Where is Calabria??  To be Continued....."}
{"text":"Calabria Bakery always the place to go when I want to get some home made Italian food, bread or pastries when I am in the area.  They used to located right at the corner of McCowan and Hwy 7 and now they moved further East closer to Markham Road.  The new location is a little smaller.... but they did a great job in bring some of the decor and the atmosphere from the previous location.  Cappuccino ($3.50) is on the milky side compare to what I prefer but not bad.  It was a nice place to hang out with your friends on a Sunny afternoon....... or maybe grab a quick lunch or a loaf of Ciabatta?  Btw, this location doesn't bake their bread on site.... but have them shipped from the location in Scarborough."}
{"text":"If you have been to the Calabria Bakery up in Markham... the one in Scarborough location will be a big disappointment!  The interior is really dated and old... with cheap cafeteria settings. But this place is runned by the first generation of  the Italian family and the one up at Markham is by their offsprings.  The coffee here is A-OK for $3 and served in a proper glassware... but the cookies or pastries in the display case are limited in selections and not too appealing.  But for the pasta and other Italian hot food they served does have a home cooking feel to it.. just like what your Italian mama will have feed you with the high carb comfort food!  I would not go out of the way to come here, and I do prefer the Markham location a lot more!"}
{"text":"Staffs are really friendly and foods are delicious. Great atmosphere with a lot of interesting decoration. Keep in mind that there is a little change in the menu everyday. Some food maybe sold-out if you walk in late."}
{"text":"Calabria Bakery on Midland was a destination for a casual business meeting on a Friday afternoon, so my friend could preempt traffic from downtown on his way out to the east end.  At 3:30, the pizza oven was still hot, and the cook was happy to take our custom order. Our pizza was thin crust and chewy, excellent as fresh out of the oven. The store wasn't busy, so we were undisturbed in out discussion. The apple strudel was pleasantly low on sweetness.  The hot table still had some veal cutlets, sausage and veggies, that might have looked better earlier in the day.  In addition to the bread and pastries, the store sells cold cuts and basic Mediterranean ingredients (e.g. extra virgin olive oil).  The service was relaxed and friendly.  This location is a short drive to subway stations, so that I could catch the LRT and subway back west and south.  This will be a place that we will keep in mind, as an alternative to the chain restaurant branches that dominate Scarborough."}
{"text":"I go to Calabria for its well regarded wood fired pizza, made in front of you while waiting.  There is an older gent cooking pizza , but only Thursday and Friday, 11AM to 4PM. I guess that's all he wants to work, but you'll get a true southern Italy pizza, in 10 minutes, for $10. It's medium, about 12\", and available plain or with traditional Calabrian or Sicilian toppings.  I order mine well done, so that the crispy crust is cooked in the center.  I have glanced at  the steam table offerings but nothing there appeals to me like the pizza, which is right up there with the fancy downtown places, but in hassle free suburbia, with a price to match."}
