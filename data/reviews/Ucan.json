{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the first time I saw this place with a huge line of college students outside. I made a note to come back in a few hours for dinner, but little did I know it would be one of the best choices I could make. \"Riz frit avec poulet et sauce tomate au four\" was one of the best dishes I've ever had in my entire life, seriously in my top 5 meals of all time. I've constantly found myself craving for it again in the following months after leaving. Sadly no where else seems to have this dish in America, so I find myself up in the middle of the night staring at pictures of this wonderful dish knowing that if I ever go back, I'm definitely eating here first."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I like this place.  Yummy food, quick service, lunch/afternoon tea at a reasonable price and friendly and attentive waitresses."}
{"text":"Good food. My meal was made to order Good location on st catherine street Friendly service Great price  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Greasy floor is really terrible from my way of understanding \"sanitization\". There is nothing spectacular of their HK style cuisine. It is what it is."}
{"text":"We ordered from JustEat. The food itself is fine. However, the delivery person was ATROCIOUS.  So much so, that I called JustEat and stated that I don't ever want that delivery man near my home ever again.   I buzzed him into our building and waited by my front door. I heard him down the hall asking random people walking down the hall whether the food was for them. I thought, \"WTF?\" The address is clearly on the bill. When he gets to my door he says that we didn't tip him enough. I looked at the bill and we had given him 10%. He said it isn't enough. I stared him down and he just walked away.  I contacted JustEat, who justifiably stated that it was inappropriate for the driver to just try and give our order to other people instead of delivering it directly to our door.  They also stated that given their behaviour, further asking for more tip was inexcusable.   Based on the reviews, it looks like this place has great food but has high staff turnover and they hire poorly. It really is unfortunate because their food is good."}
{"text":"My friend and i decided to give this place another try as we didn't like it the first time we came here when it first opened. We went there thinking maybe they improved with time but we were wrong. We ordered baked pork chop in tomato sauce and pork e fu noodles. To our surprise, when the noodles came, it looked like they just tossed left over food on a plate , zero effort, but the saddest part of all this is there were only 2 thin stripes of pork. Baked pork chop was ok. Then the desserts came, we ordered the yoji nectar mango and the coconut milk sago mango. The sago mango one tasted like plastic, we both couldn't eat more than 2 spoons of it, at this point we were hoping maybe the yoji one will taste better. When it finally came, it looked nothing like the picture in the menu. We asked the waiter, as we thought maybe they got us the wrong order. Just so we were told: nup, its the right one we only changed the type of sago and changed the bowl, it tastes the same. AND THE PART THAT MADE ME FURIOUS is she even told us  \" it tastes the same to me, it's kinda food you know \" ....like what? if i wanted * kinda food * i could have ate frozen meal 2 $ from maxi. Service was non-existent, we both ran out of water, n the waitress never came back after serving us the main dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awful, I ordered a dish from the picture they show to customers on menu, and they serve me a totally different one.  Don't recommend anyone to come."}
{"text":"Hey hey ~ At first, I thought it was a normal bbtea store, but when I saw the menu i thought it was another Chinese restaurant that sell the \"stereotype\" Asian dishes.  Looking deeply through the menu you can find dishes you never heard before and i realized they are specialized in HongKong dishes. It's really confusing lol. They have really bad marketing exposure. They should promote more of their unique dishes. We ordered Ma po tofu (friend said it was good, he is an expert in tofu) I went for the fancy stuff. YingYang milk Coffee, it feels like a HongKong Milktea fuse with coffee. I also ordered Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings). We were amazed that there was soup inside. :D (normally, cheap restaurant microwave it) The thing that got my attention was the \"Yoji Nectar\". They didn't have picture of it and I decided to give it a try. It turns out to be a specialty dessert in HongKong. Like I said, the restaurant should advertise more of their unique dishes.  The place is really nice. Relaxing Lighting. The alligator skin chair... :D haha The staffs are Mandarin, but they can understand basic English.  It was a pretty good experience haha, but you have to dig in their menu and take the risk to order weird name dishes ;P  Food lover~  Yeye"}
{"text":"Food was okay, nth really special. I took delivery the other day. girl who took the phone said it would have took 30min (I work in dtown which is like 5min by car), I took the order from 12:16, the delivery guy arrived at 1:35. it turned out the girl wrote the adress wrong. I had only an hour lunch time from 1:00-2:00, worse part is the delivery guy keeps pointing out it was not his fault of being late."}
{"text":"\"Let's order Ucan!\" said literally no one ever. 2 hours for general tao brah u kidding me?  Everything was questionable af."}
{"text":"first time we came to this place was in mid-February 2015. We were surprised to have discovered a HK style restaurant somewhere else than in chinatown. But it turned that food was so so. we were disappointed with certain dishes."}
{"text":"Finally! A place downtown Montreal that serves decent Hong Kong cafe style food.   I had a great ying-yang (half milk tea, half Hong Kong coffee) - best I've had in Montreal - with a side of fried pork chop noodle soup. Tastes exactly like it's supposed to. Egg tarts are also delicious. I can't wait to try the congees and the other HK-style desserts on the menu.  The place is newly renovated, very clean and neat. It also offers free high speed WiFi. The only thing I'd say is that it is a bit more expensive than what you'd get in Toronto, for example, where the cafes there offer a free drink with the meal (not the case here) - but it is definitely still very affordable. I am excited this place has opened in Montreal, and looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"If you want stereotypical chinese food go to chinatown. If you want HongKong speciality go to chinatown. If you want bubbletea and similar drinks go to chatime across de street.  If you want to eat something and feels like it was worth your money just go somewhere else. There's plenty other way better choices just around the corner. This place doesn't know what it's selling, lack or identify, lack of direction. You can't try to sell everything at the same time and expect it to be good."}
{"text":"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??"}
{"text":"The food we took looked nothing like in the picture, it was soggy and tasteless. If the owners read this I hope they understand that one of the things customers hate most is false advertising. Reduce your menu and keep only the good stuff."}
{"text":"Said I'd come back in my previous review, and I did. Ended up even more dissapointed, sadly. Got the baked pork chop rice, and once again, it was too greasy. Topped with way too much sauce and no veggies. I mean, it is that hard to chop up an onion in there? Most HK style cafes (esp in Toronto) do that. Anyways, went around 12. Ate half for lunch and the rest for dinner. Had intense nausea and diarrhea around 11pm. I did not eat anything else in that time frame, and I wasn't sick, so food poisoning is suspected. After coming here twice, I conclude that they do not care about food quality or freshness of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for 2 people and it took over 1.5 hour to arrive. Called the restaurant when we did not receive it after 45 minutes and the restaurant said the delivery guy left 20 minutes ago. Mind you we live 5 MINUTES BY WALK from the restaurant. Got a call at about 1 hr after we ordered delivery by a delivery guy asking for our building number again, saying that the previous guy got an accident and was stopped by the police therefore couldn't make it. He said he was going to be there in 2 minutes. No one showed up so we decided to called the restaurant to cancel the order. We called 3 times and NO ONE picked up the phone. We're talking about 8pm at night. The restaurant is definitely still open. We finally got our food more than 30 minutes after and the guy had no idea we waited that long. The food was cold already.  Also, once we ordered a combo that was available in the restaurant for takeout and the owner told us for some reason soup is not included for the takeout but he still charged us the same price as in the restaurant.  Will never order from there again. It's a shame since their food is not nearly as bad as their service."}
{"text":"we came here at around 9 pm. There are a few people.Only one waitress to do everything.No one serviced us,so we came and sat by ourself. We waited like 5mins,finally the girl came to bring the menu without smile. We ordered 2 regular meals.one was fried noodles,and the other one was honey beef with rice.The noodles tasted ok,but a little salty and nothing special.The second one had too much sauce.it looks like gigantic ocean and the beef was too sweet and not fresh. The rice dry like grandma' face. I feel like the food in the restaurant taste not like traditional Chinese food. I still recommended you to go there and have a try, because you could prove me right.There are many other restaurants in downtown Montreal and you have  other better choices. Coz the price is not cheap."}
{"text":"Hair in the food, no apologies but ask for tips... the table, glass and dishes are not well cleaned. Bad experience."}
{"text":"I live nearby and come here when I'm craving congee, my favourite breakfast meal (i think it's the only place in the area that serves it?) and other cheap eats.  It really is affordable.   I like their authentic HK menu, but the food never tastes good & fresh.  I think they use too much MSG, salt & sugar.  I question the freshness of most of it.  I feel kind of unhealthy after eating there (mild headache + general gross feeling).   The lighting is way too bright, they should install dimmers on their light switches.   2 stars: 1 star for the interesting menu + 1 for the prices."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place randomly when I was craving noodles because I was drawn in by their $7.99 lunch special. We live in NYC so we're used to cheap, delicious authentic Hong Kong food. Unfortunately, this was not that. The soup (hot and sour) was flavorful but was made with so much corn starch that it was almost gelatinous. The spring rolls were good but it's hard to mess those up. Now, the main course. I ordered chicken soup with noodles which was bland. My partner ordered pad Thai (which was my partner's mistake, as this isn't a Thai restaurant) and it came out bright orange. I wish we had gotten a photo of it because I've never seen anything like it before in my life. It didn't taste that bad, but it certainly wasn't pad Thai. The waitress wasn't overly attentive and at the end of our meal, after we paid the bill, she felt the need to inform us that the bill didn't include the tip. As I mentioned, we're from NYC and it's customary to leave tip on the table. Not sure how it goes here in Montreal but considering the mediocrity of the whole ordeal her comment rubbed us the wrong way.   TL;DR consider other options on the street."}
{"text":"Ordered food for 2 people and were told it would take about twenty minutes to be delivered. Delivery guy showed up 1+ hours after not taking responsibility. Food is ok, nothing too crazy but decent for the price."}
{"text":"5/5 for the food, 3/5 for the service and décor, but I feel bad because there's only 1 server and the price is really unbeatable.   Don't walk in thinking it's your ordinary Chinese restaurant; I would say it needs to better define its direction. From outside, it seems like an HK-style \"cha can tang\" in a predominantly northern Chinese neighbourhood, when really their best dishes are the Cantonese classics you would expect at typical family diner in Guangzhou or Hong Kong. I say it has a taste of home, but maybe that's just nostalgia.   Recommend the hand-shred chicken ?????, and their clay pot dishes. In the winter they have traditional Cantonese chicken hot pot too!"}
{"text":"Nourriture Ok, portion Ok, service Ok, prix assez abordable. Le resto n'est jamais plein.. donc quand on est plusieurs au centre-ville mais n'a pas fait de réservation (hier on était 10), et qu'on cherche une place tranquille pour passer du temps, on va souvent là :)"}
{"text":"The food here is good,  but the staffs are terrible and dishonest!  The cashier got our change wrong (she gave us 5$ instead of 15$). When we realized 30 min later and went back, the staff refused to verify. We asked to contact the owner or check the camera, refused! Will never come back."}
{"text":"So we tried this place a few years ago when visiting Montreal.  After that disaster of a dinner at Kueng Kee in Montreal Chinatown the other night, I was skeptical on Chinese food here.  The low ratings of Ucan also made me more reluctant but after walking down St Catherine street towards the far end where UCAN is located and not finding anything appealing, we ended up at Ucan and jumped in with eyes closed.   To our delight, the food was hot, fresh, flavorful and the service was decent.  The three dishes ordered came out steaming hot and ample portions.  I can wholeheartedly say that the food here is worth 4 stars.  Seating is comfy and the place is not seated back to back tables where you could whack other patrons in the ribs reaching for your dish.  I would highly recommend this place for a meal and did not experience any of the issues as reported by the other Yelpers with -2 star ratings."}
{"text":"Large selection of food, some unusual items. The service is a bit spotty, long periods of inattention from staff. The portion sizes are large, however, the flavor in some of the dishes was a bit off (compared to what we're accustomed to for those dishes). Overall, it's not a bad place, but just a bit 'cold'."}
