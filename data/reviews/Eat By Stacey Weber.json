{"text":"I've only tried the enchiladas but they were amazing!  And better for you than local Mexican restaurants.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I would have taken a pay cut to come to my new job at Zenreach just to have the catered lunches provided by you guys everyday. Every meal is better than the last, from grilled chicken sliders to braised short ribs, absolutely delicious. If I could afford it, I would eat here for every meal! Can't wait to tell all my friends and family to come check it out. I'd give this place 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"We were so happy to find a restaurant that provides gluten-free/Paleo diet-friendly foods. You can eat in or carry out. The meals are attractively displayed in refrigerated cases so that you can choose whatever looks good. They have a wonderful assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Eat is conveniently located on the north west corner of Shea and Tatum in Phx, Az.

We chose to eat our dinner there and our food was promptly served: 
Both of our meals were so yummy - short ribs with mashed potatoes and homemade chicken pot pie (best gluten free crust I've ever eaten). I brought home two chocolate desserts to enjoy later. 
We will definitely make this one of our regulars and will recommend \"Eat\" to all of our friends.

Update: I love buying the frozen meals to take home and keep on hand. The chicken pot pie is still my favorite! The desserts are great also."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend tried EAT a couple weeks ago to get something super quick after the gym. We were not expecting anything really. Right when we walked in (5 minutes before they closed) they were insanely friendly and had so many options. We got the burritos and banana butter cake. It was the best thing we both had ever had! We keep going there almost 4 times a week just because of the amazing service and quick affordable and actual healthy meals. This place is so underrated. If your even thinking about it GO! It literally costs the same amount as any fast food place but it's actually healthy and amazing for you! Couldn't say enough good things about it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after receiving a gift certificate from family. It was hard to find at first and when I called the number, it went directly to Stacey's voicemail. I was finally able to find it and am so glad! I wasn't sure my family would love the super healthy vibe of the food but they did. There's not a lot of kid-friendly options for picky little eaters, but the grown ups loved it. Got the 4-pack enchiladas and the arugula/basil/almond salad. It was a bit pricey- the enchiladas were $28 I believe- but I understand that you are paying for quality and it shows. The salad was great too and larger than it looked in the packaging. We will definitely go back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and I feel good eating it. It is also fast and affordable! I've had them heat food for me to enjoy immediately and also carried out food straight from the cooler to serve at home."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers said, this place is great! For being located in a great location it's still pretty hard to find. I hope a lot of people find it through Yelp because the basic \"Eat\" sign doesn't really advertise their amazing concept. It's VERY hard to find clean, organic foods. Their grab & go options are chef created, delicious & made with the best & healthiest ingredients. I don't eat any refined sugars or agave. That means eating almost exclusively at home. Not here though! They use things like maple syrup & raw honey to sweeten their desserts! No one does that! So impressed!!!! & HEALTHY ingredients: lots of tasty vegetables, quinoa.... This place tends to be a grab and go place, but with the hip trendy San Francisco feel it's worth occasionally having them heat up a dish and eat it on their dishes at the 8 to 10 person table."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. So healthy, flavorful and fresh. Such a nice and accommodating gentleman who helped us pick items too!"}
{"text":"I made my first visit today to check it out. It's very nice, seemed pretty clean and well organized. Like most people Im too busy to cook and or prep, but like to eat healthy. This seems great, although I have only sampled the PB powerballs and the grilled polenta at this point, both were very tasty. The labels clearly list all ingredients, calorie content would be helpful for those of us watching our weight. 
I went for a 2nd visit and was greeted as I entered, the young lady provided calorie info on everything I wanted to purchase and stated that the labels would soon include caloric info.
I'm very impressed with the food quality and tastefulness of everything I have sampled thus far."}
{"text":"I came across Eat by accident one night when I was driving by. Since then I have been back three times in a week. The food is fresh, healthy and always taste amazing. You can tell Stacey and her team really do care about the food they offer to customers. For a busy professional like myself, I no longer have to worry about what I'm going to make when I get home. I suggest everyone come check out this locally owned Grab N Go!"}
{"text":"Really healthy and delicious selection of grab and go food! I would definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"This place is great. 
Found it when heading out of town. Our first trip
We got some salmon and protein balls. Told
My daughter about it and she has been there for
Lunch several times. We have tried the protein banana pancakes. They are good. The quinoa meatballs are the bomb.  The turkey burgers is amazing. And the flourless chocolate cake is delicious. 

I think I am there now 2 times a week to stock up. The convenience of the meals for lunch and snack are priced reasonable and just the right portion. 

Only thing I didn't like was the breakfast burrito with bacon.  Was very salty and I don't like salt but won't keep me away!! :) 

We got the pleasure of running into Larry Fitzgerald one day when shopping which was cool. 

The guy in the evenings is always very personable offers suggestions and even asked about the burrito.  Has a great smile and makes the trip
In fun!!! 

You won't regret stopping by!!"}
{"text":"Eat was a little challenging to find due to construction in the building. Once we found Eat, it was well worth it. It is my birthday so a gluten free dessert was exactly what I wanted. If I am in the area again I will pick up one of their entrees."}
{"text":"I love this concept!  The food was healthy and delicious. I would like more protein options and also to have nutritional values available so I can plug them into my fitness pal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so great. I love the variety and somehow knowing the meals are healthy makes you enjoy them more. I've only had delicious items there but some of my favorite are the short ribs and the veggie salads."}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy takeout food for those of us who do not like to prepare our own meals, but are super picky about what we eat!  I recommend the overnight oats and the hummus plate!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! We picked up lunch today, beet salad with orange balsamic vinaigrette, BBQ glazed Abby back ribs and truffled devil eggs! Everything was so delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"I really love the food here! Great food at a great price. The chicken salad is my absolute favorite and I love that I can take it and go or eat it there!
Sara is always so helpful and amazing every time I go in! 
If you're in the area I would definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I just wish I had discovered it 6 months ago...it would have made sticking to my wedding diet much easier :-/ 

My boss told me about this hidden gem a few weeks ago, and now it's my go-to spot when I run out for lunch. I had been dying to find a place that had healthy salads/food near my office--and this is exactly that. 

I always get the shaker salad--which varies daily. The price is soooo incredibly reasonable, usually $4-$5, and it's the perfect size. The first one I tried had quinoa and red grapes with a white balsamic dressing. It was one of those salads I could eat every day and not get sick of. 

I was hoping to go back the next day and grab it again, but realized they don't have the same options every day (no big deal). The one they had that day didn't appeal to me (it had curry or olives in it I think?) so I opted for the quinoa and arugula salad with pomegranate seeds and Marcona almonds. That was also great, just a little pricey ($10) for me, although it is probably twice the size of their shaker salads. 

The Mediterranean shaker salad I had today with grilled pita strips, grape tomatoes and roasted red bell pepper dressing was delicious. I also splurged and got the bread pudding...which was delish as well...but probably not the healthiest choice ;-) 

This review is obnoxiously long, but when I'm looking for new places to eat, I want to know as much as possible. So, I hope this helps someone who is looking for a delicious and HEALTHY meal on-the-go :-)"}
{"text":"I couldn't recommend this place more!!! It's the perfect place to swing by and pick up amazing food for any meal of the day.  The owner has created a little haven of healthy yet delicious food items.  In a day in age where so many people are putting chemicals and fillers in our food Stacey uses only the best ingredients and is truly mindful about her recipes.  BONUS... If you have any food restrictions or allergies the staff is more than willing to help find options that will work for you.  I highly recommend checking out Eat and seeing what real food is like."}
{"text":"OMG - the food here is incredible! So far, I've tried the quiche, the southwestern burrito, the banana butter cake, the banana protein pancakes with fruit compote, and the peanut butter balls, and I have been so impressed.  (The banana butter cake is our family's personal favorite - it just melts in your mouth!)  The flavors are wonderful, the prices are very reasonable and Stacey herself is a sweetheart. I can't wait to try some of the lunch and dinner entrees.   It's probably a good thing we don't live closer or I would never find the motivation to do my own cooking again -- I would  just swing by and pick up something from EAT!"}
{"text":"Tried a few grab n go's yesterday... everything was yummy! The chicken enchiladas are great, I also got the salmon salad.. excellent! Looking forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"I recently just discovered this place and the food here is amazing! It's a great place to go to if you're looking for a quick, healthy meal that's ready out the door. They even have ready to go breakfast entrees as well! Have not been disappointed by any of the meals I have tried! If it's your first time and unsure of what to get, you have to go for the chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. They have tons of gluten free options, as well as meals for other dietary restrictions. It is so easy to find food here that caters to allergies and is pretty healthy, and the best part is it tastes fabulous! I've tried the spaghetti and meatless quinoa balls, turkey meatloaf, and two different salads, and every single meal has been wonderful. Love, love, love this place and can't wait to try more meals and some desserts, too! Definitely recommend Eat by Stacey Weber."}
{"text":"A friend told us about this place and we happened to be in town so we checked it out. This is a unique spot that caters to the healthy lifestyle on the go. Super sleek modern decor. You can see all the food prep and smell the freshness of everything. Plenty of indoor/outdoor seating to hang but you can see this place is for the health conscious peeps on the go. 5 or 6 fridges full of a ton of options : salads, soups, snacks, sodas and much more ! Check it out... Food is as awesome as the concept"}
{"text":"Extremely upset with the service! I went yesterday Friday after noon and as I walk in the employee was on her phone, I asked about particular food dish and  she said she didn't have it at the moment, I asked for another one and again the same, they didn't have it but this time she seemed annoyed! I ended up just picking something out randomly and when I went to pay I gave her my number for the rewards program and again (every time I go this happens) I was not in  the system. I asked her how would I know how many points/visits I have and she very annoyed said how would I know we have a pile of receipts we need to go through/put in the system mind you another girl told me the exact same thing a month ago! She made me sign my name on a \"napkin\" with my phone number and proceeded to charge me! We come to this place a lot and is very pricey but it'll be out last!"}
{"text":"I buy prepared food all the time from Eat.  It is always fresh, delicious and healthy.  This place is a hidden gem for busy people who want tasty and healthy food.  A lot of the food is GF and there are options for everyone from vegans to carnivores.  The quality is great and the convenience is unbeatable.  I am so glad this is close to home.  We are there at least once or twice most weeks.  Try the blackberry chicken, the GF pot pies, the peanut butter pretzel bars and the lamb meatballs.  Whatever you try if you like fresh and tasty you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, flavor sensations. Love the atmosphere and organic selections. I'll definitely make this a regular grab and go! 
Great choices for my kids too!"}
{"text":"This place is fresh, healthy, and so delicious. This is how we should eat all day, everyday."}
{"text":"So the past month I have been picking up prepped meals for our medical office next door and it's by far amazing! I always look forward to going there for lunch and picking out fresh meals especially when our office is busy doing surgeries. It's very convenient! The staff is also amazing as well! Would love to one day meet the owner I hear great things about her!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a lunch spot and sort of happened upon Eat. It's a tiny retail footprint as I believe the majority of their business is grab and go. We chose to eat in. The really friendly staff person explained our options for dining, talked us through several of the food options, and was genuinely helpful and interested in us finding the right fit. My husband chose a buffalo chicken rice bowl. I had a vegan stuffed sweet potato with black beans and spinach. We shared an appetizer of truffled deviled eggs.

Our experience was excellent. The food was fresh and organic and we both really enjoyed our selections. While they appeared a bit small in the display case, the meals were very filling and ample. It appears that they do catering also so I'm excited to try this for a larger group some time.

I would give them 5 stars for food and service. My hesitation is that everything is packaged in plastic and it creates so much waste. I know there are weird laws around take-out containers but really, I felt so guilty creating so much plastic waste."}
{"text":"Good amazing food healthy looking to cut off fat or just stay away from the toxic foods you've been eating I suggest coming down here. Where quality food is at it's best. Try there pancakes they are too die for!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Locally sourced, organic when possible. They make the meals you pick it up and take it home and heat it.  We stumbled across It thinking it was a restaurant, John however who is amazing went ahead and heated our food for us and served it to us on their table just an amazing experience! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little grab and go place. Fresh organic ingredients, friendly staff, and good food. I grabbed a breakfast burrito and a drink. It's very reasonably priced. They also offer catering for all levels of events from intimate to corporate parties. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing Hidden gem I have found in a long time! Healthy prepared foods to go, catering & you can sit down to a meal here too! I had the short ribs over garlic mashed potatoes with a morning glory muffin for dessert yesterday & somehow my car started driving here again today -from North Scottsdale - it was THAT good! 

They have a beautiful community table with little touches that were so lovely I felt like I was eating in an instagram photo. 

The meal was to die for & here I am again about to do a repeat ! 

Highly recommend. Makes me wish I had a party I throw because everything looks fantastic."}
{"text":"I found myself eating out way too much over the last several months so I've been on the hunt for a healthy alternative for quite some time. Last week this place popped up in my yelp search results and I decided to give it a whirl. 

I came in minutes before closing on a Sunday and was half expecting a rushed experience but what I received was the exact opposite. The staff was warm and extremely welcoming and allowed me my space to browse at my own pace so I didn't feel rushed. 

The amount of selections were a bit overwhelming at first and everything looked so good. I decided to try a full weeks worth of entrees and snacks to get a feel for what this place truly was about. I'll give a brief run down of my choices: 

Chicken enchiladas-Loved it 

Southwest Turkey sliders-I have to say, of the plethora of things I tried, this was by far my favorite 

Pot pie-I thought this was a quiche when I picked it up and I actually thought it was two, because it was so large. Loved it 

Buffalo chicken bowl-Didn't love it. The buffalo chicken was amazing. The brown rice it was paired with-something didn't mesh with my taste buds and I probably wouldn't get this one again. 

Maple roasted vegetables-Loved it 
Grilled vegetables-Loved it 

Paleo Chicken-this was a balsamic chicken with vegetables and...I Loved it

Turkey Meatloaf-Loved it 

Roasted vegetable salad-I'm not a salad person to begin with, so I didn't love it, but that was probably just me. I did add the side of salmon to it and it was delicious-I just don't think I'd do this one again. 

I picked up three sides: salmon, chicken and steak. All three were perfection. The grilled chicken tasted like I had grilled it myself (if I cooked, that is), the steak, to my surprise, was flavorful and tender and the salmon was perfect so I added that to my salad. 

On to the best part: treats! 

Super food bites-I loves that these did not have peanut butter in them and were perfect for my early morning routine to literally-grab and go-loved it

Banana muffin-a but small but loved it! 

Popsicle-this was the grapefruit one and it was a bit tart at first but on a 110 degree day, it was light and refreshing and I would grab again 

Last, but definitely not least, the Paleo cookies-these bad boys are to die for! I wish they came in larger quantities because I could eat them all day long! These will absolutely be in my cart on the regular! 

Compared to other places in the area, I felt the quantity of each portion and price were far better than their competitors. I have an Eat Fit Go, literally steps from my front door and I will drive 20 minutes each way to come here instead each week. 


Thank you Stacey Weber for creating a healthy grab and go for lazy cooks, such as myself! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Though not cheap by a long shot, it is worth every dime! I've sampled a lot of their foods and have loved everything. One the stand out favorites for me are their paleo chocolate chip cookies. Yum!! All meals are deliciously healthy - I've tried so many things I can't remember them all, as I've come several times. What I do recall, and again, yummy goodness, was the chicken potstickers, the turkey meatloaf over cauliflower mash, their assortment of muffins, their daily gluten free quiche, blackberry chicken, peanut butter ballsand the list goes on! All good, check em out!!"}
{"text":"Lovely idea, grab and go. Healthy food that delicious and well priced.I'm so excited I found this. The customer service was awesome too. Someone promptly greeted me and explained the choices and concept. I will definitely plan on coming back soon and bringing the rest of my family."}
{"text":"Gluten free, real food that has tons of flavor and great balance. I had the Asian wraps which were delicious and wisely followed with the flourless Chocolate cake. Le Sigh*  way too good, now I will be craving that. Great prices for the quality of food. You can get a lunch for under $10 here and it's ready when you show up. There are vegan options, paleo bars, muffins, soups, snacks, drinks I've never heard of and a lot of choices that I will have to come back and try. If you like trufoods, flower child and whole foods head over here. It's fantastic :)"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken enchiladas! Organized, quick service. First time going and they offer to heat up the food for you. 2 things I wish they would change and that is.... 1. Using biodegradable paper containers instead of the plastic, since you do have the option to microwave the food. And 2. Directions of how to heat items on the containers, there were no directions. Other than great quality and flavorful. Will definitely eat again!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! I love to pick up a healthy tasty meal especially in hot weather. Get the salmon salad with capers - I ate the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Been getting this place catered the past week at the office and I have to say it's my new favorite. I've been eating the enchiladas and it is fantastic! The enchiladas themselves are good, but the green sauce takes it to the next level. If this were a brick and mortar joint, I'd be bringing the lady."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Love love love the organic ingredients and the paleo choices. What a great place to grab and go and feel good about what you are eating. The place a cool little hip place"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for healthy, locally sourced meals.  Everything we've purchased here has been awesome.  The breakfast items are unusual and delicious.  The dinner items awesome.  This is close to my office, and I've sent many clients to this place and always look like a hero!  

My favorite is the turkey meatloaf, but honestly everything is better than we've found in higher-end restaurants.  It's obvious the chefs here are creative and skilled at fixing healthy, yummy, comfort-food meals!"}
{"text":"I am glad I stopped in while in the area, I was amazed at the prices and options! So many diet friendly choices! The paleo chocolate chip cookies are out of this world! I am looking forward to buying some meals. Super friendly customer service too."}
{"text":"I appreciate the concept and it's good to know they are here-pre made food ready to warm and eat!

The food: it's fairly healthy and tasty enough-though You won't feel like writing home about it.

The prices: higher than I really want to pay for something I still need to take somewhere and plate/ heat up.  A bit more than offerings at Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc.

The service:  This place is a bunch of coolers with a checkout counter. They will heat your food for you but don't expect it to be quick-they are busy with catering, etc."}
{"text":"This place has the best quality & tastiest food you will ever eat. It is amazing for those with food allergies, especially Celiac Disease. All products labeled GF/DF/V. Stacy is killing it & I hope her menu expands. It is not overpriced for the quality & quantity of the dishes. Would give 10 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place.
It's affordable, delicious and uses real food and ingredients I can pronounce. I love the grab and go concept and I will definitely use their catering service in the future. The shop is darling and the staff is nice. I've recently started avoiding gluten and if it is gluten free, it is clearly labeled that way. Eat also calls out what's vegetarian, vegan, and other special diet features. 
This healthy food is seriously so good! Try the quinoa arugula salad, or the paleo granola. Bottom line: Go. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here!! The service was great, front of house girl was very responsive and resourceful. I would recommend this for the healthy options and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"wow! so happy i found this place. perfectly portioned, delicious meals. i am never going to the grocery store again - no need. this is a massive life saver for me"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been getting school lunches and food for the the days we don't want or have time to cook! Great healthy high quality food, and friendly staff. Definitely two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and I LOVE the concept! The chicken pot pie is a standout to me but everything I've tried has been delicious! I've been wanting to try this place for several months and I'm so glad I finally stopped in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! High quality food, excellent flavor, with a fun variety of ingredients unlike anything I cook at home. Nothing is too spicy or too bland I have tried most everything at this point and have enjoyed every bite. It's nice if you don't have time to cook, or you're being a bit lazy. 

The bad.
I'm a larger guy 240 pounds, do physical labor most of the week as well as work out. Long story short. I eat a LOT so for the money I wish I got just a little more food. Not the main protein portion, but the veggies etc."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my party of 3 had a poor first time experience that ended up in a $5 over charge for one of the persons in my party. First off, we were recommended this place by another co-worker who raved about the delicious food. So we ended up going to go check it out for ourselves. The prices are fairly high as is, but you get the quality for what you pay for. The food is very good and no complaints there. However, my complaint is regarding the customer service side of the business which I personally believe is lacking. Today we enjoyed lunch at Eat and when we got back to work, one of the members in my party realized she was overcharged. No problem, no big deal, we simply called the place to let them know what happened. The young lady over the phone explained that the prices on their menu items had recently increased (specifically the wild salmon burgers with sweet chili aioli sauce) which was listed on their signage in store as $10 and on their online menu as $10 but per the young lady over the phone, the price is now $12. Ok, fine, but if you display $10 in the store & again $10 on your online menu, then you should clearly honor the price marked. Anyway, I allowed the young lady some time to get with her manager Teresa for a solution to the overcharge. I got a call back shortly after from the same young lady as the manager Teresa was in a meeting and couldn't call me herself (I get it), the young lady offered 10% off the over-payers next purchase. It was a laughable moment only because the person in my party was overcharged by $5, so 10% off next purchase really isn't saying much. We asked for the $5 to simply be taken off the over-payers next purchase and our request was granted. The thing is, I shouldn't of had to suggest this solution. As a small business, word of mouth gets you far and so does maintaining good customer service. The right thing would have been to suggest $5 off for the overcharge and an additional 10% off the next purchase due to the inconvenient of the customer. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Amazing Asian chicken lettuce wraps and goat cheese beet salad! Gluten free and delicious"}
{"text":"When you ask for salt and hot sauce and the waiter returns with 3 different organic hot sauces and 2 types of salt u can hardly pronounce you know you have found a black that caress about quality and integrity! Best breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First, I love the concept. Fresh, healthy food to go for the working man or woman or busy mom or dad. Prices are reasonable and there's a HUGE selection. 
Not really a place I'd come and sit to eat since it's not really set up that way. 
I ended up purchasing five items:

Pineapple Habanero Chicken
Oh my gosh was this delightful! The right amount of spice and sweet. Amazing! 

Spinach Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes
Good but a little bland. Could have used more seasoning. 

Chicken Salad
Great fruit and texture but bland to my palate as well

Sweet Potato hash
WAYYY too salty. So salty that I actually couldn't finish it. Good flavor, but needed to be dialed back several notches. 

Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble
Honestly, this review should be a 4. But this Crumble is one of the best damn things I've ever eaten plus it was gluten free. Worth the trip back for this $4 tin of heaven alone!"}
{"text":"We had EAT cater our Christmas Eve dinner. The food was wonderful-chicken and vegan enchiladas, salads, rice and beans-the food was wonderful.
Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and healthy. They have an amazing selection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Best part is they have amazing Gluten Free options. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Eat is my absolute fave!! It is so convenient and i'm so thankful it's so close! I love the turkey burgers and black bean burgers!! 10/10"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY I found this place. Safe to say I am obsessed already. We all have busy lives and times when we have zero time to cook! Being very aware of my health and what goes into my body it can be super hard to find a quick & convenient grab and go meal spot. THIS IS IT! Everything is organic (sold already lol) and they cater to 5 different diets! Gluten free, dairy free, vegan, vegetarian & paleo. Not to mention it is decently priced for organic foods! 

They offer pre made already portioned food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner & dessert. They even offer separate protein & side options. All ingredients and nutrition info is listed and easily seen. I have never found a place that offers organic cooked portioned JUST protein. I love it! Perfect for nights you wanna cook dinner but have zero proteins thawed & marinated. YAY! They have a loyalty program and deliver through post mates.

Today I just grabbed a quick lunch of steak and maple roasted veggies, delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this restaurant has 5 stars. I ordered the zoodle bowl and hummus and they were both terrible. Zoodle bowl was basically just zucchini and carrot noodles with 5 cashews and a sauce. It was very watery and had no flavor except for the sauce which was decent. Hummus was also a huge disappointment. I didn't think I could go wrong with hummus but I was proven wrong. Also very watery and without flavor. It tasted like some chickpeas, tahini, and nothing else were thrown into a food processor. All in all I definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"To be completely fair, I haven't been in to pick food out or meet the owner. Yesterday I was pressed for time and couldn't pick up food before a work meeting so I looked on Postmates to have something delivered. I'm on the Keto low carb diet so my options were really limited for something healthy. Eat By Stacey Weber popped up so after taking a look at the menu the turkey lettuce wraps seemed to be the safest option for my low carb needs. I also ordered a sparkling Ginger water, which turned out to have about my whole days worth of carb allowance in it so unfortunately I had to turn it over to a co-worker. The lettuce wraps were SO SO good. The location is actually close to my office and home, love the grab and go concept, I'll definitely be checking out more menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one day to check it out and left with an addiction to the Peanut Butter Balls.  Seriously, they are so good, and if you like nut butter, you'll love these!  I haven't really tried anything else besides the chocolate chip paleo bar and quinoa \"oatmeal\" (which is also delicious) because the meals are a bit pricey, but as far as quick snacks go, this place has a lot of good, gluten-free, healthier options!"}
