{"text":"I ordered the flipp'n burger and don't regret going, but doubt I'll go back. The patties seemed bland and the bacon was so chewy and tough that you couldn't even tear it by hand if you took it off the burger. It felt like a case of quantity over quality. Fries were good though."}
{"text":"I went there a few months ago and was really disappointed. Really hard, tiny fries. Burger was nothing special, especially for the price. The milkshake was so artificial tasting. The meal probably cost me $20 and was a big let-down."}
{"text":"This was my second time to this place.  I wanted to try it again as I wasn't terribly impressed by my first experience. I like the burger but certainly not in love with it. I found it to be missing something. Perhaps the burger is under seasoned? I appreciate that they give you a pretty decent portion of fries, which they should considering the price of a meal. Spent almost 16 bucks for a single cheeseburger, fries and a drink. Don't think I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Burgers were dry bricks, WELL charred.  Messed up the shake order as well. Kind of an expensive disappointing meal in the end.
The mission location was a big disappointment given my positive experiences with the Kensington location."}
{"text":"If you like dry bland burger than ignore my comment. As stated dry and tasteless meat. Perhaps it's a trend in this town to cook meat.until all the juices are out, but I don't find it appealing at all. Extra lean meat is not for burgers guys. The chef very nice guy, the cashier girl could smile from time to time."}
{"text":"Pretty solid breakfast spot! Great service and the breakfast is huge! I had one of the best milkshakes I've bee had! Looking fed to trying dinner or lunch here! I never had beef bacon before and it was really good."}
{"text":"The first thing I wanted to do, when I walked in here at about 4:40pm on April 12th 2017, was to apologize to the stoic individual/Chef(?) taking my order, I appeared to be inconveniencing him, it appeared that the bugger all that he was doing prior to us walking in must have been bloody engrossing, because he was clearly not pleased to see us. Maybe it was the fact that the empty room that greeted us now had me and my partner and, to set the crisis bells ringing, ONE more customer had walked in behind us too. No wonder he wasn't smiling. 

He grudgingly took my order, he didn't seem to want to  look me in the eye, I wasn't sure if he was medically diagnosed as blind or maybe his disappointment at having customers had put him into an angry, anti-zen like state.  My wife asked if she could get crispy onions on her burger, this was obviously far too complicated a question, as he looked away from us, pointed in the other direction and just said \"they're over there\". Not sure if at some point some terrible event had occurred \"over there\" and we had cruelly brought all those painful memories back. 

Almost $34 later, we went to our table, he said he'd shout when our burgers were ready. The moment came, I got what I asked for, my wife inquired about the crispy onions again, \"oh, you have to pay for them\", well of course, but it's a bit late once the F'ing (and I don't mean flipping) Burger was done. We got our fries, onion rings, and burgers, I hoped this would be amazing. Got to the table no drinks, I had to ask \"do we just raid the fridge over here?\" \"Yep\". Ok, thanks for letting us know. 

So, I will say this, anyone who can make a slice of cheese appear to be on a burger but not actually taste like it even exists must be some kind of genius, this was Schrodinger's cheese, it was both there and not there at the same time. The burger was blander than an Ed Sheehan album being covered by Sting. The fries were OK, I wish had used then to shove in my ears to prevent the \"50s Rock 'n Roll music from irritating me to near death, even the happy-go-lucky \"chef\" had an earbud in, maybe he was listening to a podcast of \"How Not to Give a Shit on a Daily Basis\", if he was, he certainly took every word of it quite literally. I would never go here again. I was so angry I wished i just threw the $34 in a drain and gone without."}
{"text":"Mini and I stopped by on their first day to see what all the fuss was about. We're regulars at the Kensington location so of course we wanted to check out the new kid on the block!

Think Flipp'n's older, sophisticated sister. Chandeliers, decorative mirrors and frames, with that red, black, and white color scheme we've come to love from Flipp'n (even the bathrooms are pretty!). They've also added some small tables and chairs outside.

The food, as always, doesn't disappoint. New to the menu are root beer floats and a gluten free, vegan burger made locally by People Foods. The same favorites are still there, including their variety of poutines. Hmmm, what else is new?

BREAKFAST! 

We were told that breakfast is launching soon and they will be yummy pancakes (their own recipe) with homemade butters, meats, and eggs. I'm super excited because I LOVE BRUNCH!

Welcome to the Mission neighborhood! I think you're going to fit right in!"}
{"text":"Liked the food and the staff! The only problem was that I had to look 15 for a parking spot, even a paid spot. It didn't seem that they had a parking, I might be wrong though. But I'll definitely recommend this place, specially if you're on foot. :)"}
{"text":"These guys take their burgers seriously! Succulent patties on a flame grilled bun with a usual selection of toppings- have eaten there twice and have not been disappointed. Their fries also retain the potato skin which I really like and the large portion means you can spilt a portion of fries with your buddy. If you are hankering for a good, old fashioned burger, you have to make a stop at flipp'n burgers"}
{"text":"The burger I had was, meh.  Nothing special unless you load the burger up with toppings it's not really worth the price of admission.  The staff, particularly one of the guys there is a bit rough around the edges.  The place had about 8 people max inside it and with four people behind the counter you'd think they could keep up.  I ended up waiting 20 minutes for my mediocre burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on Sunday morning. Loved the food, very friendly and helpful staff, great theme as well. I'll definitely drop in sometime for dinner!"}
