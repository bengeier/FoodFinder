{"text":"My family and I just ordered La-Mill for the first time, through Skip the Dishes.  It was definitely a mistake. Two salads with grilled chicken came with shawarma (the restaurant told Skip that it's \"the same thing\" ).  The hummus with beef came with chicken,  and the beef kabob dinner was way over cooked and dry.   The restaurant said that my order met their standards.  Wow, those are low standards when more than half of the order was wrong!  My order that was over $100 ended up going into the garbage, and I actually had to order a replacement dinner from another restaurant.  Overall, getting a satisfactory dinner ended up costing $200 tonight.    If I could provide 0 stars, I would.  Do yourself a favour and avoid La-Mill."}
{"text":"I order from this place through skip the dishes,  they are the only ones who have authentic middle eastern food that you can't get in any other shawarma place, their food reminds me of back home, taste amazing and presentation is always on point even when i order just 1 pc, thank you guys for such amazing food and keep it up."}
{"text":"Great food and really high quality. The Saj is really good and the meat is always tender. I ate there many times and will be eating there many times to come"}
{"text":"Granted, we got here as they opened so we had extremely personal service but they were super attentive without being overbearing.  The food delicious!  They have lots of vegetarian options and portions are huge - very shareable dishes.  The restaurant is spotless and well-lit.  I'd highly recommend this gem just off the 401."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place.  Food was not impressive. Service was very slow and unresponsive.  I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Update:  This Restaurent went down south really fast... I think it is the worst service I have ever had in Canada.. portions are ridiculously small now.. the manager was yelling at te waiters and waitresses in front of customers.. we asked for bread and it took 20 mins to get.. Food was oily and the shawarma plates (sorry mini plates) were cold ...  Not to mention they sat us on a dirty table, and while cleaning the other ones they placed the trash bag next to us for more than 20 mins! Very appetizing!   Stay away guys!!!!! It is not worth it!    ---------------------"}
{"text":"TLDR: The meat platters may be good, but the wraps are sub-par, but the chef/cook is very nice.    I found the waitresses to be a bit cold though.  I ordered something at the counter and I couldn't hear what they were saying and didn't seem happy to be there.    I ordered the falafel wrap and grilled veggie wrap.  I've had lots of Mediterranean food and I need it to meet downtown Toronto standards. While the total of two wraps was around $10, they weren't filling at all.  The falafel wrap only had two falafels and I had to ask them to put hummus on it.  I thought hummus was a standard for a falafel wrap. What's even stranger is that they put the hummus on after all the toppings.  That's just odd.  While the wrap looked big, I had to eat through at least 1/3 wrap before getting to the toppings.    The grilled veggie wrap was also mostly bread and very little taste to it as well (and I don't even add salt to most of home made meals, I just add natural spices).    I went into the \"La Mill express\" section of the place and I figure two wraps should be easy enough to make.  It still took about 10-12 minutes.  Honestly, if the food was better and more filling (i.e. more nutrients instead of bread), I wouldn't mind at all, but when I basically end up eating bread with a side of veggies and two falafels for $10, it's kind of annoying.  The chef is very nice and he seemed overwhelmed though and I really want to give them 3 stars because he was so nice, but these wraps were just bad.  Verdict: Might be good for meat eaters, but if you're a healthy plant based eater, don't bother."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant! Soooooo much better than the competition all around Mississauga. The only place that does proper authentic Saj!   You can get a shawarma on saj and it tastes amazing, so my mom says! And she is super picky! Not all dark meat! And the falafels are hands down my favourite in Mississauga!   Everything here is so tasty including the tabouli which has pomegranate sauce in it, which isn't totally traditional but a tasty twist!   I highly recommend to give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Not so good customer service. Food not so great. Took the chicken grill, very dry. The fries was amazing though"}
{"text":"The food was better than paramounts. Their hot sauce is very flavourful as well. However I was a extremely disappointed in the quantity size they offer. I understand paramount poor quantity size but for a new restaurant to have such poor size quantity size is not acceptable. I believe it's a trick they use to serve bread to fill you up faster so when it comes to your meal you seem full and don't feel that the portion of the mean was small. I hope they actually increase their portion size for their meat. Literally not worth your money going here unless you want to stuff yourself and pay a premium for bread."}
{"text":"I never got to eat here, so this is a review based on the poor customer service.  Showed up on Eid.  HUGE MISTAKE, place was packed with the exception of 1 table out on their outdoor patio.  I stood at the door for quite some time, being ignored by a couple of waitresses.  They were busy clearing tables, seating other diners, and were probably overwhelmed.  It seemed a bit chaotic as there were other patrons standing around, waiting to be seated, standing in a line, etc.  Finally, a man in a blue dress shirt and dress pants, who I assumed was a manager/supervisor, said that there was a table outside, if we wanted.  He even opened the door to double-check.  He said that he'd send someone out.  After sitting outside, catching up with my friend for at least 10-15mins, with no waitress, I go to check in.  I see the same gentleman and tell him that no one came out yet with any menus.  5-7mins later, a waitress comes out with a note pad and asks if we're ready to order.  We tell her that we haven't even received any menus...as per our empty table.  She left and we waited for at least a few more minutes before giving up and finally leaving.  There was definitely a problem with being short staffed &/or mismanaged.  It's Eid, a holiday already on your calendar, people aren't fasting, they're gonna go out to eat, so why didn't they put more people on duty??  I'm sure if I visited on a non-holiday, my review would be quite different.  If it took soo long to not even get a menu, imagine how long the food would've taken...if at all?  Outdoor patio could've also been used better.  It was HUGE, but there were only a few tables.  Could've easily doubled the amount of tables and been better use of space."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food in a pleasant and comfortable environment. The patio this time of the year is perfect for evening entertainment with family and friends. The staff was warm and accommodating. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Came to this restaurant on Friday for lunch and didn't have a great experience. I ordered the tabbouleh salad but was told they didn't have it. Instead I requested for the saj crepe but again, was told they didn't have it. So the rest of my table put in their orders and the waitress said she'd come back to take my order once I figured out what I wanted. She never returned.   After finally flagging her down, I decided on the Kibbeh and the Rkakat Jebneh from the Hot Mezza section. The food took a while to come, such that other members of my party started to notice as well. Eventually everybody received their meals with the exception of myself. I gave it some more time knowing that I had placed my order late, however when everyone was close to finishing their meals I finally followed up on my food and shortly after the waitress brought it out. The Kibbeh was ice cold in the centre and did not come with tahini sauce despite what the menu states. The Rkakat Jebneh was very greasy.  My coworkers seemed to enjoy their dishes and there were no complaints on their end. However I did not enjoy both the food and the service and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is ok....... Wraps are nothing special.. might as well take a drive down street to another shawarna place.. customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food and ambiance. It almost feels like a hidden tucked away shawarma place. We tried the shish tawook sand which, chicken shawarma plate, manakeesh, and hummus platter. Everything was delicious!"}
