{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it's close to where I live and maybe I'm naive but I'm still hoping for a good restaurant on prince Arthur.  I went here for brunch on Sunday right after Eater put them on the list of best brunches in the city (you really let me down Eater). We were a group of 8 and had a reservation. As soon as we got there we were told the brunch menu wasn't available! We decided to stay and eat from the regular menu because we were short on time and  had our doubts about being able to find another table for 8 nearby. We were the only ones there, we should have taken that as a sign. The service was consistently bad though the poor waitress had only started a day ago and had been left there by herself so it's not fair to blame her. Water wasn't refilled, we didn't have silverware in spite of asking for it twice. I can always overlook bad service if the food is good but sadly this was not the case! Nobody liked their food. The tacos were tiny, the burritos were lackluster, the beef was gamey and the sauces were tasteless. I ordered the fried chicken and it tasted like it had been fried in old oil, yesterday. It was barely warm when it arrived at the table. Speaking of which, three of us were served our food and then the other plates came out 15 min later! I had ordered a taco with the chicken and it never arrived. After we were done eating, I went to ask the waitress who was behind the bar if it was coming.  She had had it on the counter behind the bar the whole time! So it's been sitting there for 45 minutes at this point and she offered it to me any way! I refused it kindly and she took it off the bill. We left hungry and disgruntled. There was a couple outside looking at the brunch menu (they had a board advertising it on the sidewalk even though it wasn't available!) and we told them not to bother going in. And that's what I'm telling you too, don't bother!"}
{"text":"Amazing nacho and salsa. Which is the reason we returned for lunch the next day. Ensalada and a pulled porc taco. Taco was mini and dry, salad was ok. Overall an average meal but would definitely return for drinks, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Friendly staff nice decor and delicious food ! The veggie tacos are the best :) + not too expensive"}
{"text":"Came here, seated ourselves, waited 10m, saw that no one else had food, and since no one had come by went and found a waitress and were told it would be over an hour before we would get food (this was at 8:30 on a Thursday) and so we left."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars. We ordered through Just Eat for pickup and it was a complete disaster. The pickup time shown was 6:55pm. When my husband got there ~ 7pm , they said it'll just be a minute, and then left him waiting 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, they came back and said that they didn't have one of the items (the fried chicken). He asked for a refund and then they made him wait again, and then told him they couldn't refund the money and that we had to contact JustEat. It still took another 20 minutes after that to get the food. So altogether 45 minutes of waiting in the restaurant for them to give us anything. Got home, opened the bag it turns out they only gave us HALF the order:  2 tacos missing, chips missing and fish starter ALL missing in addition to the chicken. More than an hour of our Saturday night is gone and we're still missing 5 items worth more than $30. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"Good place and great food. 

We saw the place before while walking around Plateau area and decided give it a shot. It is a new and renovated place, so it was clean and fresh. Staff was friendly and quick, probably they got the point from previous reviewers. 

Food - get a fish or falafel tacos, they are the best. Ask for ongoing promotions as for example they have 2$ selected tacos on Tuesdays. 

Overall good experience and 95% confident to come over again."}
{"text":"Go straight to Taqueria Arturo to get it all - amazing authentic, creative fresh and so satisfying!
Recently visited Oohlala Mobile.com's Montreal HQ for a week to build strategies. Discovered foid gold around the corner. Yep!  you want the get there.

Arturo's and sister shop Diablo's (on Saint Laurent arond the corner) get in right every time. Taco and tquilla bliss at one, smokey award winning ribs plus smoked and fried chicken to comfort you in flavors.

Opened just a few weeks Arturo's will quickly be any seeker of true food and vibe's go to lunch, dinner or late night.

Try it all, high end tequilla and mezcal abound, combined with the friendliest, most attentive staff this traveler found all week. Brunch on Saturday 10-3 blew me away. Get in early and often - you'll have a new go to and your belly will love you more."}
{"text":"Not good. Not fresh, guac squeezed out of a packet, tacos dry and lacking flavour with meats that are dried at the corners, they been waiting to get served for so long. Don't waste your money, go to T&T, La Capital, TaChido or Escondite instead!"}
{"text":"We went in on a whim and the ordered nachos, mojitos, and split a BBQ chicken burrito. All the serving sizes were very generous and the food was delish"}
{"text":"Solid don't bother on this one, the service was very slow, the tables were covered in dust, the sangria was watered down, and the tacos were very small and overpriced."}
{"text":"What a great find in Montreal! A variety of delicious, inexpensive, creative and beautifully presented tacos and burritos, along with shareable appetizers and a solid cocktail menu complete with trendy Mezcal options. Taco and burrito fillings range from authentic Mexican carnitas and barbacoa to Peking duck and falafel.  Tacos are priced so you can order a few to try ($2-4 each). Favorites at our table included the Baja fish and falafel. Everything we had was flavorful and fresh. 

The atmosphere is funky and fun, with lots of reclaimed wood and Mexican accents, art and candles. On the Friday we were there, they had a DJ, giving the place a party vibe (but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other). Cool features include a selection of Mexican sodas on the menu that you don't usually see, and churros for dessert, served with rich caramel and chocolate sauce for dipping.

Service was enthusiastic and friendly, with spot-on recommendations for the indecisive in our group. 

We will definitely go back, and plan to bring friends."}
{"text":"Short version: good tacos at a reasonable price if you want to eat quickly. Still new though and will just improve in coming weeks.

Decided to try this new place that opened 2 months I found about on Eater Montreal. 

Made reservation for 4 people online, I love restaurant who has this option on their website, so convenient. 

We got there at 21:15 and it was a little weird because we waited inside by the door and no one came to see us for about 5 minutes, I therefore went to talk with one of the few waiters and she just told me we could just sit anywhere we wanted as the restaurant was not full.

The location used to a breakfast and brunch place, it has two separate levels and is spacious, however I was a little disappointed with the decoration, they didn't do much and it is quite similar to the old restaurant.

I therefore guessed that it was maybe all about the food experience. Their menu is simple and straightforward with entradas, 10 kinds of tacos and burritos as well as diversified alcohol menu.
We started with two entrées, the guacamole and the fried pollo; the guacamole was good and tasty as well as the pollo even though the pieces of fried chicken are most of them really small.
We then ordered each one of us a couple of Tacos, they're small tacos so 5-6 is good. I got the cod (good), falafel (reaallly good that I ordered it again), pork and brisket (good) and chorizo (very average).

The service was average; the waiter was really nice and friendly, however they do not come to check on the tables regularly and it's hard to make eye contact as they would behind the bar. 

The prices are reasonable, 35$ for 6 tacos and two shared entrées as well a margarita.

It was a good experience overall and I will try it again in a few months to give more time."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal after a long flight.  The service was super slow, there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant, so inexcusable; waiters avoiding eye contact, and we had to beg for water service. We started out with nachos that were ordered with carnitas, but when they finally arrived, no meat. We were so hungry we didn't want to send them back. No apology or acknowledgement for the mistake and we had to make sure we didn't get charged for the carnitas. Two of the people in the party had  3 tacos of various kinds, all missing the mark, no salsa , kind of unremarkable. Cheese enchiladas were okay and ahi tuna tostada consisted of an oily deep fried corn tortilla, with 3 slices of seared ahi tuna with some unidentifiable sauce drizzled under the fish. I guess if you are looking for more classic \"Mexican\" food this isn't the place to go. Some sort of fusion, confusion going on here. I thought it was a bit pricey for what we got. BTW- the only credit card they take is American Express, what's that about."}
{"text":"I got the Baja tacos, probably the best I've ever had! The margarita started strong but got a very different drink the second time around. Not complaining though, still got a good buzz. Kind of expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"A new spot on Prince Arthur!  Hopefully they can pull it off!  Great tasty tacos with smoked meats and fresh fish.  The best was the barbacoa and the tinga, and the table salsas were very flavorful! The bar is well stocked with mezcal and tequila and the pitcher of margaritas with orange blossom water were excellent.  I will for sure return!"}
{"text":"Sssssslllllooooowwwww service   taco was dry as dirt she said she would bring hot sauce but after all 5 tacos had been eaten still no sauce. I find that even though they speak English in these parts if you speak French you come first.  

We love tacos would have been back but after the long wait for everything and not getting  refills I will pass"}
{"text":"Decent tacos, okay price, friendly. Giving it 3 stars because they were out of nearly every taco when I went for dinner. I ordered the black bean tacos but they tasted like canned beans and the taco was luke warm.

I have trouble giving below a 3 star because our waitress was friendly and the service was good. The best part of my meal was the chips and guacamole and the free round of tequila shots they gave us due to the lack of items on the menu.

Would I go back? Probably not. Would I recommend someone else to try tacos here? Probably not. I think you'll find better tacos elsewhere in Montreal.

The brisket tacos were a bit chewy for example, and the condiments on top were even a bit stale.  At least they offered to bring more chips."}
{"text":"Their menu is appetizing, but the food was very disappointing. The tacos were super dry, the meat as much as the tortilla, and barely any sauce or toppings. We ordered a fried chicken appetizer and we got 5 pieces of chicken the size of my thumb tip, which were good, but they could have added a few more pieces for 9$.
It's really overpriced for the quality, I would gladly pay the price if it was worth it, but it's not. Paid 20$ for 3 tiny tacos and 2 and a half bites of fried chicken. 
Also the service is ridiculously slow, not rude or anything, but so slow. They should check on their customers from time to time because there is no way of making eye contact with them unless you go up to the bar.
Their drink menu seemed good, and I liked the quirky decor, but I doubt I'll ever come back.
Too bad, it would be a sweet spot if the food was good.

Oh and the tacos looked nothing like the ones in the photos here, literally had almost 0 toppings!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab a quick dinner. Worth checking out and reasonably priced.

Food: Pretty good. I went for dinner so it wasn't the brunch menu, but I've heard good things about the brunch menu. I had some tacos which I thought were good but weren't particularly amazing. I had a margarita which was fantastic though.

Service: I found it kind of slow. We waited more than 15 minutes for food and drink, and likewise when we asked for the check. Otherwise it was fine.

Price: Definitely fair for the food given. I wouldn't call it either a steal or expensive, kind of just right in terms of price.

Ambiance: hipster feeling and lively, I liked it. When it got later they dimmed the lights which was fine, but started playing music that was a little too loud."}
