{"text":"I love everything on the menu! I like that you order from the till and then serve yourself for water and utensils. It was super casual but the food was amazing. Had the chicken curry , the Tuna soba and I think it was a vegetarian falafel curry? Could be way off. They were all delicious though!"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavourful food, exceptional enthusiastic staff and real dishes! Aka no styrofoam. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"We had the Pad Thai and it was OK, yes just OK.  Defiantly not worth the price at all, way to expensive for you get.  With 4th St and 17th Ave offering so many other Asian restaurants we probably won't go back to Foo as the prices are a bit insane for what you get."}
{"text":"This Asian fusion place is a casual sit down (capacity for about 17) but primarily serves the takeout and delivery crowd. Portions are a healthy size and definitely good value for the dollars ($$).

I had the beef and broccoli chow mien where the beef brisket chunks were huge and not just a few of them. The only negative would be slightly too much sauce, but that may be a matter of taste.

I'd gladly come back and try some more of the inviting dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is a glorified Noodlebox, but personally I think Noodlebox has better food. I got the brisket chow mein and it was swimming in a really salty sauce, indistinguishable flavours just mainly salt. Large chunks of brisket that were kinda grey and gross. Basically food court quality."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food has been mediocre. Last time
I had the red curry with chicken and my friend had the pad Thai with chicken. Both dishes were a bit boring- needed something else.... more spice? Peanuts? Cilantro? ... something. The time before I had the papaya salad, and again it felt like it was missing something. 
On the positive- the prices are reasonable and the staff are very pleasant. They've done a great job with the interior, and I think it's a great addition to 4st dining."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack. Wow. The veggie spring roles were huge hot and delicious (that's what she said) I enjoyed a red  coconut curry and it was good enough that the bowl may have been licked.  Fresh ingredients real chicken and full of flavour. I will be returning. Yum yum. There's no foo in this kitchen, they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I had the Crispy Chicken which was described as \"crispy chicken with ginger chili and seasonal veggies and rice\".  The chicken was very tasty with good bite of ginger and spicy chili but I think calling green onion seasonal veggies is a bit of a stretch.  Searched my entire bowl and nada veggies.  Big portion of chicken but that's it.  I think if you are going to charge $14 for a lunch bowl it should be more than just a protein and a half cup of rice.  I would have given this place 4 - 4.5 if they had even thrown in 2 pieces of broccoli, some carrot or something green.  Pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"After a long day's hike, this food really hit the spot!

Friendly service & great food

Just the kinda of hearty meal to make you feel good  & cozy :)

Will definitely go back again...soon."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things - unfortunately didn't taste any. My bowl lacked sauce and flavour. The tofu was soggy rubber. If you are trying to convince anyone tofu can taste good - don't take them here. Too bad because they have a great concept and room - but it's the food that would want me to come back - I won't be."}
{"text":"I was faced with a dilemma right away. I ordered the sweet and sour pork belly for 14 bucks, gave her $15 and was going to give her the extra loonie, but she didn't give my change back. So do I say \"hey I need my change\" and then just give it back to her? Anyway.  Flavour wasnt really sweet and sour. I have never had pork belly before but it was 80% fat, so I don't know if that's normal. Portion size is pretty small for 14 bucks."}
{"text":"Great new spot for Asian Fusion.  I had the beef noodle soup which I can best describe as a hybrid between Pho and Vietnamese beef stew.  The flavour profiles marry quite well and their are similar variations in modern Vietnamese cuisine. Great spot for pick-up or quick in-and-out.  Price point is a bit high in my opinion but definitely worth a try for Asian Fusion fans."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had the pork and pineapple fried rice. Very quick. Recommend for quick lunches when you want to step out of the office. Will go back."}
{"text":"I had the red curry. It was OK for the price. The flavours were good but could have been spicier with more veggies. The service was great though, very welcoming. But I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great spot and they love what they do here. It may not have been my favourite meal but they were so attentive when they noticed I didn't love it.  The veg and sauce where delish but I didn't love the protein portion.  Really a personal preference.  I'm sure the next person would love it. Offered and insisted they make it right and went way beyond.  Will be back to support because I love when people love what they do and care how it's received.  My friends meals were delicious and they loved it."}
{"text":"Yumalicious! We definitely add this to our short list of places to visit when we are in Calgary. 

One of my favourite dishes is the pork belly. Melt in your mouth YUM! I often have to bring leftovers home with me.

There are a number of gluten free options on the menu, and are they ever TASTY! Hard to choose just one!

Staff have always been super friendly, and well-informed about the gluten free status of the offerings.  Daily specials usually throw another challenging choice in the arena. 

Summer 2017, Patio wasn't licenced. Not because they don't want to! ALCB rules were... excessive.  ALCB rules WERE changed in 2017, so we have high hopes for 2018!

Parking, we've always successfully parked on the street, and usually come on a weekend for \"brunch\". (We all know I don't get up early enough...so it's good they have decent hours!)

The people watching is great! I sit at the window bar and chow down. 

Licenced, wine, beer, cider, and of course they have Boylan's sodas! 

Washrooms are downstairs, but there IS one on the main level if you are stair-challenged.

We keep coming back... there are a LOT of great food choices in the area, but this one keeps calling my name."}
{"text":"Very fresh and flavorful. Vegan friendly and friendly service. Reasonable priced for the quality you get. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars
Seems like a neat concept having Asian street food.  I ordered the seafood noodle curry dish which was very flavourful.  The salmon and prawns were nicely done as were the veggies.  The other fish slice which I think was tuna ? was overcooked and less fresh.  The sauce to noodle ratio didn't seem quite right as the noodles were swimming in the sauce but maybe that is personal preference.  I might just try to order steamed rice on the side rather than the noodles.   
Price point was good for the food quality and concept.  Plus atmosphere was sleek.  
Will try some other dishes to see if rating could be boosted.  As there seems like good potential for other dishes to shine as they were interesting menu items.  
Not convinced that it is genuine Asian street food. Rather gentrified westernized street food instead.  
But do give it a try as they deserve a chance to stay on the highly competitive 4th street scene."}
{"text":"So delicious!! We went to Foo for the first time tonight and were so happy we did! We ordered the green papaya salad and requested a little less spice (because I'm pregnant and have the worst heartburn known to humanity), and they were super gracious - made it to the perfect spice level for me. It was crunchy and perfectly balanced. The Broccoli and beef chow mein was fresh, with great flavour and beautiful tender chunks of brisket. We also ordered the coconut chicken lettuce cups - amazing!! Rich coconut flavour and kaffir lime made this dish addictive! Thank you for the excellent service and delicious, fresh food! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Another addition to the already great food scene in Mission :)

Parking available is whatever is on the streets unless you want to pay for the parking lot across the street. Parking in Mission is always limited, so I usually park further away and choose to walk a few blocks. 

Tried this place twice already and the dishes I've tried so far were all great. It is a fairly small restaurant with limited number of seats, but I did see many people get take-out and haven't seen the place packed yet. It's one of those places where you pay for your food first and then wait for your food (take-out or dine in). I think if you view it as fast food it may seem a little expensive, but I thought the prices were reasonable for the location and how fresh the ingredients are. I didn't like that it was a self-serve for water and utensils, especially when they ask for a tip while you pay for your food. (PS. Do you tip when you pay for your food before you receive it? Will the service be crappy if you don't tip first? What it I want to tip after I eat - will they spit in my food? This is why I hate pay-first restaurant-style places)

The first visit I had the lettuce wraps with ground chicken. The chicken was cooked really well and was full of flavour. I took leftovers home and it reheated well too. 

The second time I tried the octopus salad and the red coconut curry. The octopus salad was good, definitely a bit smaller in portion but thought the salad dressing was good, and the octopus covered in sweet chili sauce was great also. The red coconut curry was flavourful and it looked small in portion at first, but we were both pretty full after eating these two dishes. 

Overall I really enjoyed the food here and would definitely visit again. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends and family as well if you are looking for a yummy quick bite on 4th!"}
{"text":"Three of us went for a quick weekday lunch.
Chinese lettuce cups were tasty with Thai flavours. Pork belly was well flavoured and seasoned. Pad Thai was quite saucy and was overseasoned. Pork dumplings were okay. We had mixed vegetables on the side as well. I come back but it was not amazing. Approachable street food. It's an order before you sit place where you get your own cutlery. Service was good and speedy. Not a bad addition to Calgary's culinary scene."}
{"text":"Red Coconut Curry is so good! Great portions, service and location. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So good!! I got the beef and broccoli chow mien and it was delicious and the portion was gigantic, I'll be eating it for lunch again tomorrow and I can't wait. 

I got my food as take out and my food was ready extremely quickly and all ingredients were very fresh."}
{"text":"Great food...!!! Very courteous staff, loved the food
We tried caramelised chicken and red coconut curry both were delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack and ended up having a really nice meal. Vegan friendly which is a plus. I had the coconut chicken which was beautiful and also the red coconut curry. I will be back. Nice little restaurant. Mainly street food but with a twist. Staff so friendly and proud of what they serve. We will be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, white-washed Asian food.  But I guess that's why it's in mission and not Chinatown right? Underwhelming but they are kind enough to provide a selection of hot sauces, chilli oil etc so you can spice up your bland meal enough that it becomes edible. I had the pineapple pork fried rice dish, spring rolls, and the pork bao. Friendly and helpful staff but I won't be returning.  Calgary has so many excellent places to eat at that it just wouldn't be fair to myself to eat at FOO ever again."}
{"text":"I ate the Pork and Pineapple fried rice it was pretty good. I appreciated their attention to the food presentation. It was enticing. Lots of flavours and textures throughout with refreshing pineapple chunks. Generously sized portion.

The atmosphere was really relaxing with chill beats playing and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I miss Koob (and its fantastic koobideh!) a lot but I have to say that Foo Food is a trade up. First, they've done a huge reno that's given us proper seating (and lots for such a small space), washrooms, and a much more inviting space in general. 

Foo is \"Asian fusion\" and it's fast service, order at the counter and your meal is delivered to you, very fast service done efficiently at very good prices given portion size and quality, and it's all very nicely plated... I love this style of dining, not intimidating table service if you're dining alone (which I usually am) but it's all done with real porcelain, real metal utensils. It's not fast food per se but it's fast... very reminiscent of, say, the outstanding Watercress Vietnamese to the west on 17th.

Anyway, the food is delicious, all sauces and condiments made in-house and the flavours are complex and interesting. What I had for lunch today really impressed, fantastic from start to finish: pork dumplings with a peanut sauce condiment that was just off the chain delicious... could have had two orders of that... and then fried rice with beef and kimchi. This wasn't what I expected, which was strong Korean flavours with a lot of gochujang; it was actually more Thai flavoured, with thai basil in there, but the rice was toothsome and of perfect texture and everything worked beautifully. Could have been a tad spicier but I'll attend to that next time. This was $22 all in (water to drink) and was absolutely worth it. Thrilled to see this Victoria success story open in Calgary."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here based on what I've heard and I don't know if it was an off day or what but damn this was not good. The broccoli chow mein sounded tasty however was an over cooked starchy bowl of noodles with bland sauce. I don't think the bok choy was rinsed well either since it was gritty with sand. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since it opened and tonight was the night. I ordered the beef and broccoli chow mien and a side of masala fries.  I thought the price was maybe just a touch high, but it ended up being worth it. The fries were tasty and the chow mien was very good with lots of tender beef and there was more than enough to fill you up. Can't wait to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great small space with great food. Generous Portions and decently priced too. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend the sweet & sour pork belly. The beef noodle soup was also amazing with it's rich broth and perfectly cooked tender brisket. Also great for people in a hurry as each dish comes up very quick."}
{"text":"Great Flavors  very fresh ingredients, nice find for us as we wanted something quick but not priced crazy like some of the places on 4th street.  Portions were fair and quite large for the value.  There were 2 of us and we shared the Papaya Salad and coconut chicken lettuce crisps.  I guess place is only 2 days old. Hope it stays.  Casual eat in or dine out.  I'd come again.  Thanks"}
