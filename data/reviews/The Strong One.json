{"text":"Nice little corner cafe adjacent to Toronto Western Hospital Emergency entrance at Dundas and Bathurst. It's easy to miss except for the sidewalk signs grabbing my attention. 
It's a sister store to Empire Espresso on College St. which has has quite a success attracting coffee fanatics from everywhere. 
The quality of coffee and baking is top notch and made in house commanding a premium price so if you want low cost there are a couple Timmys  nearby. I paid $7.50 for a large drip coffee and a cinnamon bun. They were both great though with the bun being rich and melt in your mouth delicious. Yummy!
There's a spacious patio out front and a nice bright space inside to sit and ponder life in a quiet neighbourhood. Worth seeking out if you're nearby."}
{"text":"The lavender honey latte was pretty good but someone must have dropped some donuts on the floor because this place has ants."}
{"text":"That spaghetti muffin was amazing, just cheesy pasta goodness in the form of a muffin.  It also got everyone in my office in getting one of their own because it's super cool looking.  I would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe at the edge of Kensington Market with a fantastic selection of lattes. I highly recommend either the Peanut Butter Nutella or Honey Lavender latte.

The croissant muffins are also amazing!"}
