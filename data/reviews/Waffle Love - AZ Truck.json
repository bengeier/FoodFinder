{"text":"Just do it!  Strawberry and cream is dangerously delicious!  After you have it, you will dream about it!"}
{"text":"Waffle Love is so good! My friends and I hunt these trucks down no matter how far we have to drive! The workers are always so nice!"}
{"text":"This truck is the cutest!!  I have been following them on social media (which they have a huge following) and I love how they are so involved in the community and give back!!  Their waffles are bomb.com!!  They have a lot of options, so it can be hard to decide.  Once you try them you will be hooked.  Make sure to ask for a punch card!"}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about this place and then you throw in the fact they are on on food truck show on cooking channel.  I tried the chocolate dream and it was rock hard.  I had to use s knife to cut and it was very hard.  Sorry not worth the 9.00 or all the fanfare"}
{"text":"Best waffles on the planet. Why settle for a \"crush\" when you can taste true \"LOVE\"!!!"}
{"text":"My entire family LOVES Waffle Love! It's such a fun place to take the family to get a yummy treat, their store is so dang cute and I love the Arizona vibe you feel inside! Their portions are perfect and the yummy toppings you choose to put on your waffle are always fresh and top quality! Waffle Love is a must if you haven't been, you wil be in heaven"}
{"text":"4th time here. The first 3 were amazing! Couldn't say anything better. But this time really sucked. There were no adults on board managing and it was just
A bunch of teenagers. One of them even started hooting and shouting. Like really?
 They were located at the American Leadership Academy on San Tan Pkwy and I came around 6:00. The other trucks were empty as hell and there was only two people in front of me waiting on their order. I ordered two waffles: banana/strawberry/nutella/cream + banana/strawberry/biscoff/cream and paid $18.50 with tax. I got burnt ass waffles and I'm not happy that I had to saw the heck out of it when eating mine!! Sorry but this time really disappointed me and my friend.."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first time tasting from the Waffle teuck. We ordered a Nutella with strawberries n cream and a Cinnamon Bliss which had a scoop of fried like vanilla ice and the crust was cereal, then they drive it with a warm sauce and this waffle has cinnamon on it almost tas te like a churro. But either way they were awesome and had many flavor to chose from. I also like that they put their schedule up to show where their going to be for the week."}
{"text":"Best waffle I have ever had! I want to go back and try all of the flavors and toppings. Love is real with this waffle truck. And the home made cream is to die for."}
{"text":"Well, my first experience at the Waffle Love food truck was a very positive one! I had issues trying to figure out which one to get but decided on the Cinnamon Roll waffle. As expected, the portion size wasn't too large; the reason for why I liked this waffle so much was because it wasn't overly sweet like some others get depending on your choice of toppings. This one had cinnamon butter with cream cheese frosting. If I could get 10 of these at a time then I would!

Cannot wait to visit not only the food truck again, but also check out their new store in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"We used the food truck for an event.  The waffles were very good.  I have no problems with the product, but I have to agree with other reviews that the staff is not very well trained.  I was concerned when they arrived and saw that the staff was very young.
I made sure that we broke down our groups to avoid long lines.  So overall it worked out ok since the staff was not at all concerned regarding wait times.
The billing process was a total disaster even after the employee called the office for guidance.
I would like to use them again because I like the product, but the entire process was not very professional and took too much effort on my part.  I cater many events and expect the process to be smooth, especially when you pay someone to provide that service."}
{"text":"I watched them on The Great Food Truck Race and they definitely live up to the hype! I can't wait to eat there again! The waffles are so fluffy and delicious! I couldn't eat just one!"}
{"text":"This is some good ass waffles !!! With the most amazing fast service!!! The kids absolutely loved this .. we randomly found this truck and what a gem . Don't miss out on this truck. Not only is it beautiful but the food is amazing ."}
{"text":"Waffle tasted good but  small and outrageously priced. I'm not a fan of places where customer service isn't even at average level."}
{"text":"The Waffle itself is small. smaller than your typical Belgian waffle or a home frozen waffle. 
The toppings are berries, ice cream, Nutella, chocolate spread and some fruits. 
Price is pretty high 2 waffles almost $20. 
They taste good and have a wonderful texture. But I don't think it's worth an hour wait. Seriously if there are 6 people ahead of you be prepared to wait 40-60 minutes. 
Also it's a food truck so watch where you park nearby, Waffle love seems to attract a lot of young teen drivers."}
{"text":"First time having their amazing waffle n i will definitely be on the look out for the location of the truck. The line was long but worth the wait. I ordered the waffle with Nutella n it was better than anticipated which was also a slight curse dince i had to share it with 2 other ppl. Thanks for visiting the west side."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Waffle Love!! 

We got the Waffle Works and the Cinnamon one. I absolutely love Belgian waffles and have been dying to try these in the states. The truck itself is absolutely adorable and the workers are so friendly. We also tried their Pina Colada, which was very refreshing. 

I gave it 4 stars because I thought the price was a bit high and the sweetness of all the flavors drown out the original waffle taste. I will definitely chase them down again soon but this time, ask to go light on the whip cream and etc. 

This truck would be an absolute success in CA by a park or the beach where people can chill outside. Arizona is just too hot!"}
{"text":"Pretty slow at las sendas food truck night on may 5 2017.  They need to watch the best, fast food trucks output of product.  Great food, but the high school type staff does you no favors."}
{"text":"I was so excited, when I saw the truck pull into the shopping plaza near our house I couldn't wait till they opened!  It's soooooo good. All the choices are great, that it's hard to make a choice!  You can find the truck on their FB page and I guess they just opened a store in Gilbert.  Enjoy every delicious bite and make sure to get a punch card."}
{"text":"I've seen this food truck many times before over the past few years but I never actually tried it until this weekend. It was so good! I got a gluten free waffle with Nutella, cinnamon sugar, and strawberries. It was amazing. I'm seriously going to be tempted to get one every time I see the truck now haha. I'd love to try out their other toppings too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS WAFFLE TRUCK!
I've visited this food truck in a total about 4 times and each time I order the same yummy waffle!! The Works Waffle (Waffle topped with biscoff, strawberries and whipped cream). The whip cream they make is soooo damn good!! The waffle is warm and they are not stingy with the fruit, biscoff was introduced to me by them!! It's best described as graham cracker like peanut butter... droooool!!
The only reason I took a star away, which was hard for me cause I really do love them, is that I visited twice when they were mildly busier and the waffle was clearly rushed and had a lot less whip cream along with a really disappointing presentation (half the flavor is in the appearance). So I've just made the decision to not go when they are at a food truck festival like setting and to seek them out when they are at a low key area during the week. I will seek you out WAFFLE LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"We had waffle love at the Peoria food truck rally.  All I have to say is wow!  Had to wait about 10-15 minutes but it was really worth it.  They give you lots of options for toppings and some recommended toppings also!  It comes out hot and very delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to a food truck and had a waffle! So good. It was nice and fluffy, but had a good crunch. I can see why people love these so much. Plus, I waited like 10 min, so it was definitely fresh. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. My boyfriend got the Nutella one and definitely was too sweet for me, but delicious too."}
{"text":"From the first glimpse of the 60's hippie vibe paint job, I knew this was going to be a special experience. I was right. My dental hygienist had actually told me about the calendar, and not long after, my fianc√© and I were able to track down that colorful truck nearby on a Saturday morning. We'd had the liege waffles from another establishment in town, which were fantastic, but these set the bar much higher. Something about the freshness of the toppings made everything better. My guy chose the Nutella Love that came with strawberries and cream, which he absolutely loved. I had the Red Wonder, which offers Biscoff, raspberries, strawberries, and cream. Yum, just thinking about those sweet and crunchy waffles...think I'll go check that calendar..."}
{"text":"Pretty sure a chain restaurant executed, such as ihop, a better waffle. The waffle is small and packed full of a sugary dough-like taste. That was one major problems with this waffle. The batter clearly had a ton of sugar in it, the waffle itself was possibly under cooked, and then a glob of \"cream\" bigger than the waffle was piled on top. Never again."}
{"text":"If you're going to splurge, and want a great selection of the tastiest waffles around this is definitely the truck for you! Always yummy, always a line, and ALWAYS worth it. So much flavor and goodness in every bite. We drive over 25 miles some times to get to where they are. My kids love it and we have tried every day Waffle on the menu. If you see the waffle truck do yourself a favor and stop."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST waffles and customer service I have ever experienced. My apartment complex was lucky enough to have this truck stop by this evening, and I threw my dinner plans out the window. I got the gluten-free CinnaLove and my Dude and my Mom got the Chocolate Dream and we all gained 5 lbs and lived happily ever after. When I saw that WL even had this option for a glutentard like myself, I was overwhelmed. My eyes welled up and I had that \"they really do love me\" feeling. Oddly enough, my confection was the envy of the group even though they usually avoid anything sans gluten. In fact, my nickname may or may not be \"Rice Cakes\". The duo that ran the operation was super charming, lovely and prompt. Please don't ever stop Waffle Love."}
{"text":"The one time we went to where they were parked that night they had no gluten-free waffles.  Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Meh...these are not waffles. They are waffle shaped croissants. Dough is sweet but tastes like crossaints and is layered like crossaint dough. Did not like it. I was looking forward to real waffles. There wasn't that many people yet it took forever to get our three orders. The person calling out the orders called me by wrong name. I corrected him and his reponse..wait for it.....\"yeah\" and handed me my order.  Reaally?! 

Serving size is small - I'd say they are over priced."}
{"text":"The strawberries and cream waffle was AMAZING! The truck so gorgeous and super clean inside. Also, they took debit which was very convenient since I didn't have cash on hand."}
{"text":"This is probably the best food truck ever. And let me say that I know my food trucks. I used to not be gluten free and I still loved the truck. Great variety, great people and great service. But recently they came to my community center. And to my surprise they have gluten free!! I have never been so happy in my life. And it's the greatest waffle I've ever had. I beg everyone to experience these waffles."}
{"text":"Waffles are good, but they don't know what they are doing as far as running a business. This is the second event we have attended with the waffle love truck present. The fact that it takes 30-40 minutes to get waffles out the door is just crazy."}
{"text":"I love this truck, it moves all over the place. I like plain and that's because I think, why ruin perfection? Give this place a try, as it's a newer concept and the guys that run it aim to please. There are dozens of varieties to choose from and you can get as crazy or more plain as you want to. I love waffle love, maybe you will too."}
{"text":"I love waffles, they're so much better then pancakes. 
These guys showed up at my work place, and I just couldn't resist.
I order the Strawberries & Cream waffle. Honestly, I was not expecting much from this place, since food coming from a food truck, just seems so weird and unclean. 
the presentation of the strawberries and the cream looked almost like a flower. Once I took the first bite, I knew this was it...I knew. It's as if, my taste buds died and went to heaven. The flavor of the waffle and the compliment of the strawberries & cream, brung my boring workday to full force concentration. 
Definitely would recommend. It's made to order and the fruit is fresh."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. I am OBSESSED with this truck and these waffles. I often give myself excuses to go after them! The waffles are uh-MAZING! Just enough sweetness, cooked to perfection and there are enough variations that you are sure to find one you'll love. The value is totally there. Quality ingredients and freshly made, you can't beat that! The waffle with toppings is pretty big. It's a perfect size for me but it's definitely shareable!

My favorite is Nutella Love (cause duh, Nutella) but I do raspberries instead of strawberries. I'm not sure if their cream is fresh but it sure tastes like it is! Depending on the location/time they will get super busy so if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend it. 

The staff is always super friendly and helpful. I totally believe in these people and their food. I can't wait to go in their Gilbert shop one day!!"}
{"text":"The truck at the Chandler Shamrock Festival was a godsend, and the young gentleman who was cashiering - truly made a difference!!!"}
{"text":"Q:  How is a baseball team like a waffle?
A:  They both need a good batter.

ROFL = An Asian trying to say, \"waffle.\"  I love ROFLs and waffles and for those keeping up with Food Network's The Great Food Truck Race, you will know that this waffle truck from Utah is amazing.  I love their backstory --- How a community and family banded together to help a downtrodden guy get back on his feet; how even when competition is fierce, they stick to their beliefs and do what they feel is right; and how when other competitors show their true colors and their cattiness overflows, these guys keep it real [I'm looking at you, food truck from Scottsdale --- you'll never have my money or review].  Waffle Love is too legit to quit.  This has been the food truck we've been cheering on since the beginning of the season [no love for the Snobsdale truck]!

So while I've been seeing them pop up all over the valley, I always find myself at the other side of town or preoccupied to visit their truck.  Finally, we traveled out to Higley High's Homecoming to test their waffles.  Pee-in-my-pants excitement exuded from me!

\"Love at first bite\" indeed!  Oh. My. Goodness.  Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  These babies were served while they were still warm and had I been wearing a skirt, it would have flipped in delight.  We shared a Red Wonder [Biscoff spread, strawberries, raspberries, and cream], a Nutella Love [Nutella, strawberries, and cream], and a Dirty Dr. Pepper.  W-hoa!  The cream was whipped to a stiff peak and it wasn't overly sweet like what I was anticipating.  I loved each and every bite!  I didn't care that I was standing around some dark high school parking lot in my work-out gear [you know I ate back 5x the calories I burned but YOLO --- I'm young and reckless as my beautiful siSTAR, Aline N., would say!]. hunched over my waffle on a low-wall in front of the school while cheers were crying out from the bleachers.  It was a perfect night:  Delicious waffles, my favorite food truck in this season's The Great Food Truck Race, and great weather. 

On a side-note:  I hope their grilled cheese waffles with poblano chiles show up on their menu!  Please?  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time having this waffle and let me say it was delicious. The truck was at the Laveen location at the dairy farm Danszien which was a perfect pair, milk and waffles!  I had the Nutella Love  and I look forward to trying out the rest of their choices they have. My new favorite place"}
{"text":"The best waffle I've ever tasted! They come here in Surprise every Monday, and we always grab some every time"}
