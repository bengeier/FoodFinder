{"text":"I like trying new pizza places. Partly because it gives me an excuse to review something new, and partly because I'm in denial that most pizza places in Ottawa suck. Sadly this place is no exception.  Ordered a small combo pizza with feta cheese. I have to give them credit where credit is due, they did get here fast. 35 mins later and they were here. The pizza was a good size, typical thick crust pizza like EVERY other pizza place in Ottawa. They were extremely stingy on the toppings, like really. They put maybe 8 pieces of green pepper, a few mushrooms and a few pieces of pepperoni. The feta cost $1.60 extra but they put maybe a tablespoon on top.   The sauce was the deal breaker for me though. It wasn't good. There are two places in Ottawa that make this strange, sour tasting sauce: this place and Bronson Pizza. I really don't like it, don't know what else to say. It tastes sour to me.   The food was at least cheap but you get what you pay for folks."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from Vanier Pizza and Subs once. I had their steak sub, and I was really disappointed.  A whole sub is about $8, and wasn't at all worth it. PIta wraps from places like Extreme Pita and Pita Pit really pack their sandwiches with veggies and fillings, for the same price, while this sub barely had anything in it. It had steak, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and cheese, but I swear there was only about five slices each of every filling, and the steak was very tough and dry. The bread was also nothing special, and much smaller than other sub restaurants will serve. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again."}
