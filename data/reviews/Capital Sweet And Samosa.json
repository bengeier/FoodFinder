{"text":"3 for $1 veggie samosas. Always fresh, crispy, and just the right amount of spice. The dough flakes perfectly when you bite into it, and you cant just have one. The stuffing is fluffy and packed with flavor. I always bring some back with me to Ottawa now!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience - for all Afghans that are familiar with our culture - I ordered 10 pounds of Jalabi and 15 pounds of Fish for Nowroz - I paid $100 cash deposit - Jalabi came to $40 and the Fish I was tild is $9/pound, so it should have been $135. Instead, they made me 15 pieces (each $14) of Fish and called me a lier when I confronted to correct the situation - I believe they event went to the extend of re-writing or fabricated the order reciept to write 15 peices as oppose 15 pounds - extremely poor customer service, thinks that everyone is a fool and charged me $75 more than what I ordered originally. I will never go back and I will tell everyone about my poor experience to ensure that no one else is decieved by this cunning person! Its not about the money, its about the ethics and how he makes a fool of his customers - its a shame!"}
{"text":"They have great veggie samosa (3 for $1) and beef samosa (2 for $1). Their sweets are also good specially barfi and gulab jamun."}
{"text":"First time that I have had jalebi that was fresh and crispy when I bit into it!

The little desserts were a bit of a hot and miss depending on the flavour:
Pistaschio 3/5
Coconut 4/5
Almond 4/5

The other items (especially the more savory items) did not look so savory so, by-passed those...samosas were a bit over-priced as well."}
{"text":"Just moved into this neighborhood and wanted to try their \"beef\" biryani. When people advertise \"beef\" biryani, I expect there to beef pieces and not ground beef.

I take biryani home to notice that there are no beef pieces and that it's entirely ground beef. I went there a little later to ask him if that's standard for beef biryani to have ground beef. The owner/cook rudely said ground beef is beef and if I'm unhappy, to bring my food from home and he'll return my money.

There are so many things I wanted to try at that place, but with my 1st experience being so awful, I will never return there and neither will my family."}
{"text":"Standard samosas and quick service. If you're craving samosas or any fritters from the Asian subcontinent, come here."}
{"text":"3 veggie samosas for a dollar. (I see others have mentioned that) And they are good! Don't ask me about anything else they sell, or getting stuck in line behind someone with a huge order. These things happen."}
{"text":"I'm all for second chances and this place deserves a better rating for my 2nd time around. 

Purchased beef samosas which were night and day, no drippings of oil. Applause! The fresh smell of chicken biriyani coming from the kitchen led me to order two containers for $4.99 each. 

Biriyani was fresh, piping hot! Literally out of the oven, the styrofoam containers were sunken in from the bottom by the time I got home. Huge portion and I mean huge! Even I couldn't finish, rice was very well done. Vintage basmati!"}
{"text":"Was hungry and this place was on my way home, so thought I'd drop by and check it out. This place mainly sells indian sweets and snacks, and is mostly a take out place however the do sell food and few seats by the window you can sit. I ordered the chilli chicken, chicken biryani, and some chicken samosas. Not impressed with the food at all. The chicken samosa was small and had no flavor. Same thing with both the chilli chicken and chicken biryani. Was quite bland even though I asked for spicy."}
{"text":"The lineups can't be for their Samosas
As we were heading into Faley, a Hakka restaurant located in the same strip mall, I noticed the rather lengthy lineup for Capital Sweets and Samosas. Rather unusual for a Saturday night. As I am always on the hunt for a good Samosa, at the end of our dinner I ducked out in order to sample Capital's Samosas. Unfortunately, it's fitting that this establishments' very name places sweets first and Samosas last. As their Samosas are nothing to rave about. True, their iteration is priced at 3 for $1 but the price isn't everything. This example is a rather diminutive, leaden triangle filled entirely with a single ingredient that I could taste: potatoes. An exemplary Samosa, of which there are dozens of examples throughout the GTA, is larger filled with an equal amount of peas. And a dough that is thin and crisp. So, unfortunately, not recommended at any price.
Their Jalebis, however, a cloyingly sweet Indian street food, fare much better. Crispy, sweet and some hollow sections were filled with liquefied simple sugar is terrific. 
Note that Jalebis are only one of Capital's wide offering of South Asian desserts"}

{"text":"I've been going to Capital Sweets ever since they opened years ago. The place itself is specifically designed as a cash and carry that specializes in appetizers and desserts, with maybe 5-6 bar stools at the front of the store if you want to eat your order right away.

The name says it all, sweets and samosa from spice blends inspired by the tribal regions in Pakistan/Afghanistan. The sweets are always rich and fresh and oh so soft, and the samosas are a steal at 3 for $1 Veg and 2 for $1 Meat. They seem to have extended hours for Muslim holidays and Ramadan so you might want to call if you're running late. Last Ramadan I saw them fulfilling huge orders with rubbermaid totes full of samosas for family functions and parties. They do make main courses, but those that I've tried are really greasy, expensive (based on proportion) and not that great compared to similar stores in the immediate area.

Recommendations:
-3 for $1 veg samosas"}
