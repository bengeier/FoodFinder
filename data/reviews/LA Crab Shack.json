{"text":"This is my family's new favorite seafood spot! Seasoning on sausage was perfect. My favorite dish was the gumbo and I would recommend it to everyone! Only two cons, margarita could have been a little stronger and our server Viviana was very slow. Nothing that couldn't be changed. Definitely will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The foods here is good, great service. I like their combo price, very reasonable. The sauces was good too."}
{"text":"Their shrimp were big and tasty. Compared to orther places like Hot n Juicy, they definately have better Cajun fries and a better price for sides. Service was great. Overall, would come back again."}
{"text":"Loved it !!,First time trying Crawfish and it was delicious ! Tried the medium spice sauce with Crawfish,  Shrimp , and Crab legs YUMM!!!! OH AND the Gumbo ...Best I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"First off.... go here compared to Angry crab and that other Juicy place. The flavors r so much better and the atmosphere is nice. Every time I've been to Angry Crab n that Juicy place my  shrimp is always over cooked. LA Crab does it right... And OMG the oyster were HUGE. 
The garlic and butter on my shrimp was suckulucious (yah baby) along with huge cutes of sausages."}
{"text":"Great place with a variety of seafood/Cajun flair! Very tasty and quick service, our server gave us some great advice on specials and what to order. I ordered the soft shell crab poor boy! What a treat, favorable and the sauce was spicy and tangy! They also make a pretty good Margarita!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab Who? Hot and Juicy what?  LA Crab Shack knocks all of them out of the water!
The same way I feel about Angry Crab is the same way I feel about Hot and Juicy ... they both steam their seafood wayyyy too long, everything is chewy or mushy and way too salty!  LA Crab Shack somehow managed to seal the deal with their way of cooking.  The similarities are uncanny.  All three restaurants offer the \"Trifecta\" cooking style but LA Crab Shack's Trifecta is tastier and more flavorful.  It's garlicky-ier than the other restaurants and not in an overbearing way. It's delicious!  I ordered a pound of steamed shrimp, half pound of mussels, 1 sausage, 2 potatoes and 1 ear of corn.  I should have ordered 2 ears of corn.  They were that good!

I believe when I checked them out they've only been around for about a week at that point.  This was almost 2 months ago.  I hope the quality of the food and cooking is just as good.  I hope it hasn't changed before I get a chance to go back."}
{"text":"With a bunch of places like this, I wouldn't chose this as my go-to place. 

My bf and I love eating seafood and we go to angry crab at least a couple of times a month but since this place just opened, we wanted to give it a try. 

We got our usual, Cajun fries, a pound of shrimp, and a pound of snow crab with corn. 

We noticed the fries came out very stringy with little to no flavor, so we asked the waitress for more Cajun seasoning, she said of course I'll bring you out some but then followed up with \"we rather under season then over season\" hmm... since you are a restaurant, I expect you to season it near perfect if not perfect, not under season?? 

Their crab shack sauce is not very good either. I feel like it's missing something but I can't pinpoint what. The sauce did get better by the end of the meal when our food cooled down a bit which is odd. 

BUT the biggest disappointment was the shrimp, it was very unshrimp like. The texture was very soft like fall apart as though they over cooked it but then the taste was very off putting. I get those once in a while when I go to angry crab but here, one after another, they were all the same so I kept trying to eat another shrimp hoping it would redeemed the previous shrimp but no, all I was left with is a foul taste in my mouth that would linger... 

Like I said, with tons of places like this in AZ now, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This place beats angry crab! Definitely try the house blend sause it goes great with anything on the menu. Great customer service!  Even the  chef stopped by our table to make shore our meal aas delish."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious. We were going to go to Angry Crab but the wait was like 45 minutes long and I found this place and there wasn't a wait at all. I am so glad we went. It was AMAZING. Maybe even better than the one we planned. Coming back soon"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Went there for my son's birthday. He loved it. The garlic butter was amazing but warning for those you'll see after!  They brought over a piece of cheese cake for his birthday...nice touch!"}
{"text":"First time visitor since I usually go to another Crab Shack for my fix. This was a TOTALLY disappointing visit this Friday. We waited to be greeted and seated for 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us at the door. Put our name on a list board, that was obviously not being used. Finally seated and then ignored until we spoke up about 15 minutes later. My dining partner ordered the king crab and I the Dungeness crab, both in garlic butter, onion rings, caesar salad, french bread. Delivery was strange after the onion rings arrived, in that the salad arrived in a plastic tub like at the grocery store (very undressed, but acceptable) followed closely by the king crab legs. We had to ask for the french bread that came half way through the king crab. No mention of the Dungeness crab until about 30 minutes later they presented the crab (uncooked) at the table to view???? Meanwhile my guest is perplexed and I just urged her to eat her entree. About 20 later my crab came out and upon opening the cooking bag, realized the crab was cooked whole, but not cleaned prior to cooking!!!!And also not cleaned AFTER cooking. I'm from the Pacific Northwest and have had crab many many times as well as catching my own crab and NEVER had a uncleaned crab be cooked and served. 

Questioned the server and he said that's they way they cook it here and that's why he never liked it! Finally found out they didn't have a dungeness crab and went out to buy one for my order. They did not charge me for the Dungeness crab dinner because of the hour long wait to receive it in an inedible form. Waiter refused to acknowledge that crabs are not eaten without being cleaned first. If ANYONE has ever had a whole crab eaten this way pease let me know since my Google search ended with no luck. Even if cooked whole, the crab is always cleaned before serving. The least is that the diner should be advised this is the \"style\" they are presenting.

Due to the fact the service was extremely slow and parts of the order showed up at random times, without any reason, AND a whole uncleaned cooked crab, I cannot give them any stars, but had to give then one to post review. Truly a disappointing time. It's obvious I will never be back."}
{"text":"The place was dead on a Monday lunch during our first visit, except for two occupied booths in the corner. My first impression from the decor to the menu was that it was a smiling version of Angry Crab. Even the crab shack Blend sauce is a combination of the same three sauces (cajun/lemon pepper/garlic butter). 

Stood around awkwardly for a minute looking around, wondering if we should seat ourselves. An employee eventually came jogging up from the back, and several minutes after being sat a server came by. Disappointed that they didn't have a cocktail menu (wine, draft & bottle beer, margaritas) and not trusting the margaritas, we ordered Cokes. A few minutes later we were told they were out so we grabbed a bottle of beer each. At $3.50, not a bad price. 

Ordered 2lbs of shrimp with the Blend sauce, medium spicy & 1lb of mussels with the Blend sauce, hot. Added sausage, corn, and potatoes. The mussels were delicious but the shrimp was slightly more fishy than sweet, and there were a couple heads in the bag. Bill came to 50$, which is comparable to Angry Crab's prices. 

The staff wasn't so terrible as to be unforgivable, but they seemed disinterested at best. The server checked on us often enough, asking if we needed more beers (we didn't), but never offered to fill our waters. My mouth was on fire from the hot sauce on the mussels, so that was a bummer to me. The medium level of spiciness was barely noticeable, on the other hand. 

The biggest complaint is the sauce. It was so oily and buttery that it didn't stick to the seafood at all, merely settled on the bottom of the bag. It was difficult to get the flavor on the seafood. Also, being almost identical to Angry Crab's Trifecta sauce, it fell short. Didn't pack quite as much of a punch. 

."}
{"text":"Watch out Angry Crab, this place got you beat not only is it a open area space with lot of lighting and TVs, so you can enjoy yourself it also has great wait staff.  

This place is on point and for the price half what you pay for at Angry Crab with larger shrimp portion sizes and flavor.

I have to say that I was a little sketchy about the place but like all things in Arizona everything's are in the strip mall the shrimp that I had was larger than what I got over at Angry Crab they never messed up my order two or three times, he got it right the first time,  drink specials are on point to bring people in this is a slice of Heaven you have to go and check this place out to a couple of drinks, 2 dinners for under $30! Can you do that Angry Crab no you can't ! People are leaving there if at best spending over a hundred bucks for the same meal here at LA Crab Shack.. 

I encourage everyone to go by the LA Crab Shack located on Broadway it is the best. Sign up on Facebook so that way you know what the specials and deals are hope to see you all thwre soon."}
{"text":"Service was excellent & manager came out and asked about the food. That's a rarity these days but we liked it. Must try the crab shack blend-medium. I got the mild,my husband got the medium. the medium was better   not too spicy with a hint of sweet. Hush puppies & calamari good as well. We left very happy & full."}
{"text":"I don't like seafood but my girl does so I decided to check this place out with her. All I had was the hush puppies which were plain but not bad at all, maybe if I had put some ketchup on them they would have tasted even better. They tasted like potato balls. I liked that they cook them in a different oil than they cook the seafood. I'm a vegeterian and I don't eat seafood so that was definentely appreciated. I asked our server, Kayla, if the oil was different and she informed me it was after she asked the chef for us. My girl had cajun shrimp, potatoes and corn on the cob. She said she loved it and enjoyed it more than angry crab. I like how this place isn't as packed as angry crab but it does have a similiar vibe\look to it. Great local spot that I see my girl wanting to come back to plenty of times in the future. Kayla was amazing as a server. Her customer service skills really made our visit as awesome as possible. She  kept communication with us throughout our whole visit and gave us extra sauce when we asked for it. The houseblend cajun is the best according to my girl so make sure you get that one. She tried the other one and didn't like it. I liked how the chef was asking everyone how the food was and taking everyones feedback into consideration for the future. Good seafood joint! Make sure you ask for Kayla!"}
{"text":"As a seasoned Boiling Crab veteran, I had high hopes for LA Crab Shack. After an underwhelming experience at Hot n Juicy (we got takeout and the spiciest level sauce was watery and bland), I was ready to be disappointed.

LA CRAB DELIVERED! The house sauce was THICK, super spicy, a little sweet, with tons of chunky garlic. It was everything I wanted and more. I was blown away because - dare I say it?! - I LIKED IT MORE THAN BOILING CRAB! Seriously, it was amazingly good. It was perfect.

The service was on point. There are sinks to wash your hands outside of the bathroom, which is super awesome, because eating shrimp can get messy AF. Best of all, there was NO wait for a table on a Sunday night.

It's like all the good parts of an LA crab shack without the crappy overcrowdedness of actual LA.

Woot!

I'll be back, FOR SURE."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Our server checked on us frequently for water refills and the food came out as a timely manner. 

I ordered a basket of Cajun fries to start and then a pound of shrimp, with corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausage. 

I was impressed at how sweet the shrimp was! It made me realize that other boil-style restaurants don't have much flavor, other than the spices! Another bonus, the sausage wasn't too drenched or salty. Super impressed. 

But the reason why I can't give a full five stars is because their Cajun fries were so sad. There was barely any seasoning on it. Just a simple dash. And that's not how to do Cajun fries justice at the very least. My boyfriend and I joked that we would come back if we could bring in our own bag of fries from Five Guys."}
{"text":"If you like Angry Crab, you'll love this place!  But this place is better - no 2-Hour wait!!! We came on a Saturday night and got seated right away. There were still several empty tables when we left.  We got the B Combo - shrimp, snow crab, crawfish, sausage, corn and potatoes - all with the garlic butter and mild seasoning.  It was served just like at Angry Crab - all in a bag.  It was still a bit spicy, but not overpowering.  We thought it was great, and we walked out STUFFED!!!  Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for their charbroiled oysters.  You will not find better charred oysters in Phoenix.  They are huge, tasty and delicious.  $2 beers, amazing friendly service.  The manager comes and greets every table, the servers are friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  I'd love to try their po boys and gumbo but the oysters are so damn good (and filling) that I can't see myself ever being able to come here and NOT get them.

Side note: I love across the street from angry crab and they also have these on their menu, but are half the size and a quarter as tasty."}
{"text":"I've frequented about 30 different places like these from Texas to the Bay Area. Although this one is not my favorite, it is in the top 5 that I've been to. This last trip was my 3rd time here and they have finally fully dialed in their food, sauces and other items that were weak in the past. We had 1lb of Shrimp with the HOT version of the LA Crab Shack style sauce, bowl of Gumbo and some french bread to mop up the sauce, which was really great tasting. The sauce, when done right, is kind of addicting to eat. Not loaded with grease but tons upon tons of flavor and you just can't seem to stop eating it. (or al least I can't) Vastly improved from my previous 2 visits. The Gumbo was really great tasting, filling and satisfying. A little light on the shrimp in it but plenty of sausage. This place for a Cajun-Asian fusion place is as good as they get. Prices very reasonable and great value. So glad to finally have a place that rivals Milpitas / San Jose, CA Cajun Seafood shops. This is a WINNER for this type food."}
{"text":"The best yet? I think so.
After years of going to Angry Crabs and Hot N Juicy, finally found the place that offers truly the best seafood.
Not only just that, everyone here is so nice. Especially the owner, he offers us extra special food or sauce every single time.
This place is simply the BEST"}
{"text":"For the similar portion that I could order at HnJ in Tempe for $70 before tax, I can just go with the combo A for almost half price but with way better quality. The spicy level sticks up to the flavors, and when you mean \"medium\", it's medium, not mild, not hot- perfectly seasoning with perfect spice level. Also, my combo comes with a lot of garlics, and I love garlic, so it works out well.

There are almost no waiting time on a busy Saturday night. The ambience is nice, servers are nice, and the owner always comes out to check and make sure the food meet your expectations.

Bye Angry Crab, bye HnJ, and say Hello to my new favorite crab shack in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Really great place for crab and other seafood cravings. The prices are reasonable and the menu offers a good variety of food. You basically build your own meal or bucket; add items that you want and choose the flavor. All of them are good. 

What I really enjoy is the ambience. The music is not super loud and so far the service has always, always been great. The food comes out in a timely manner too."}
{"text":"If you like sweeter sauces then maybe you will like this but I am not a fan. I ordered the shrimp with their Crab Shack blend sauce and was underwhelmed. I prefer the ultra flavorful and garlic-packed sauce at Angry Crab and the plump well-cooked shrimp at Hot N Juicy.  Still waiting for a place comparable to Boiling Crab in CA. Fries were fully seasoned and crunchy.  Their alcoholic drinks are cheap regularly and dirt cheap for happy hour ~$3 margaritas."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in awhile but dang they really improved! The house blend sauce is just B.O.M.B.!! I think it's my new favorite place for Viet-Cajun!

And damn the pricey isn't that bad either! I got the Combo A! 3 pounds of food! Plus clams! Sausage! Corn! And potatoes! For like $30!! 

I believe our waitress's name was kevian? She was AMAZING! Her recommendation was on point! Drink was kept filled! Super nice and super friendly! Made my dining experience amazing!"}
{"text":"This spot is new and is pretty good! My girlfriend and I love seafood so we always hunt to find anything good. It's safe to say we will be back. We had a 1LB of shrimp, added sausage, potatoes and corn, with a side of Cajun fries.
The shrimp was bomb, so much sweeter than Hot and Juicy. The best part is when the potatoes soak in the sauce and it's endless flavor.
The Cajun fries were a bit disappointing, very plain and underwhelming. Maybe I'll stop by Five Guys before I stop next time lol.
The service was awesome! Our server was so attentive. She was so personable and added to the experience. I forgot her name, but her nickname is \"Kiwi\". Seems like every time I needed a refill I never had to wait. Which was awesome because our meal was pretty spicy! lol"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday right at opening (12pm). The restaurant was empty of other guests. Our server greeted us promptly and enthusiastically answered all our newbie questions. Wifey ordered the Ragun Cajun seasoned Crawfish and expressed great satisfaction. I ordered the the garlic mussels and they were perfect (not chewy). Next came the calamari and it too melted in the mouth instead of being rubbery. As an untraditional desert we ordered the Char Grilled oysters. Previously, I never encountered a method or recipe for oysters that was palatable.  These were delicious, however, they are very rich, so, the order of 6 (vs 12) was a good choice. The hush puppies were likewise delectable. Our unadventurous child stuck with chicken fingers. They were tasty but a lil bit spicy, but never fear, the accompanying lemon pepper fries were awesome. 

In Arizona I rarely find myself complimenting restaurants believing the food somewhat boring here. We left LA Crabshack immensely satiated for a welcomed change.  Look-out The Boiling Crab in San Jose, the LA Crabshack is ready for a title fight..."}
{"text":"Delicious! The booths are a little uncomfortable but the service here and the food were both great!"}
{"text":"So I'll start off by saying I'm only giving them four stars because of service. On the other hand the food was great. I've had oysters before but not grilled. I'll tell you they were amazing. I also got the fried soft shell crab which were just alright. Last I got the Combo \"A\" which is clams, crawfish, shrimp, with sausage, potatoes and corn. I'm so surprised that 2 people can eat all that food. It was so good I just kept going. Now the service wasn't all that great. The server didn't know how to course our food out. We got there softshell crab first then the boiled seafood with the grilled oysters being last. The server didn't know where the only one oyster that they had came from. Lol Overall everything was pretty good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big angry crab fan so was a little critical of the possibility of liking LA crab shack BUT... It was amazing! The house blend is awesome and service was phenomenal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here. It has an adorable pirates theme that my kids loved. The food was tasty in a different style than I'm used to. It is a completely different flavor and texture than competitors. It is made so that the sauce can be eaten with rice. The garlic is made different so you aren't getting hard uncooked chunks of garlic. The competitors typically have an intense overbearing cajun flavor; everything is lighter and you can taste the seafood here. The cajun fries are quite the opposite of what you'd expect. A very subtle and minimal flavor that my kids could eat (too spicy elsewhere). The kids meal chicken had ACTUAL chicken breast as opposed to batter so thick it makes it hard for kids to chew. I feel like the chicken had a chick fil a kind of a style to it, my kids loved it. The service was super fast since it is newer and quieter. More importantly, the bathrooms are clean!!! Will definitely visit again. The seafood is actual weight. I know sometimes you question if you really get a pound's worth. The owner was there and walking around talking to people which makes it feel like they really care."}
{"text":"Amazing starting from the service to the food, every moment was enjoyed by me and my family. About time Arizona got a good seafood restaurant. And It also doesn't hurt that the prices are a steal here either! More reason to order a couple extra pounds of food. We ordered a combo b since there was an offer of a free sampler. We got the combo crab shack blend mild, the flavors of the sauce were real tasty by maybe a bit too garlicky? But once it's mixed with some rice it was perfect. Meanwhile their sampler was a pretty great deal with loads of fried goodies ranging from frog legs to hush puppies. Even after the deal is over I might just continue to order it next time. And as for the service the servers there were very friendly and the owner was also very attentive by asking for feedback and checking in on us. The only thing I could want more from this place is a wider variety of maybe some margaritas or other mixed drinks to accompany the food. And for them to hurry up and get some fresh crawfish!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Asian food but saw this place was \"ACTUALLY\" open.  After a year of waiting....Im finally here to devour some spicy seafood.. 
  We were greeted and seated promptly by Adam. He was well knowledgeable about their  menu and the establishment. He seem like he had all the right answers; what's good with what?, what year was this establishment built?, and is this a franchise? Lol.  Yes, I asked him all these questions. 
 They had an excellent combo selection A, B, and C that come with Sausage, sweet corn and potatoes. I chose \"B\" Snow crab legs, shrimp (1lb), Crawfish (2lb). I wasnt into the crawfish. Then asked, if I was able to substitute 1lb of mussels and add a pound to the shrimp. They accommodated my request with no hesitation. I picked the crab shack blend and it was phenomenal. Very true to the Cajun spices, with bit of zzzzing. I hope they dont change it. I also ordered a side of white rice to the meal.Soaked up the flavors real good. I guess I had my Asian food fix too . 
 I am definitely coming back after my food coma.."}
{"text":"I grew up in Mississippi and spent a lot of time in Louisiana. The food here is really good; tried the shrimp, crawfish, catfish, sausage, gumbo and crab legs. You can customize the sauces and spicy level...which I really like. Staff was really friendly and the food came out fairly quickly (given the nature of the food). Glad to have a little taste of home in the desert!"}
{"text":"I've been to many seafood joints in various cities and state, but this one stand out the most. I love the seasoning sauce. It's better than Hot and Juicy crawfish, I think. The sauce is thicker so it stay in the seafood. It has an Asian influence to the taste. I lived it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The hubby and I enjoy the food here. Our favorite is the snow crab legs. The staff is friendly and are very good at keeping drinks filled and buckets empty."}
{"text":"Here's another case where i wish I could do a half star (you reading this, Yelp!?).  I'd go 3.5 here if I could.

It wasn't busy when we showed up.  Staff was friendly.  Waiter was nice but seemed unsure about some of our questions (e.g. what's in the sampler?).  But he remained friendly and checked back a few times while we were deciding.  We opted for the Combo A.  There are three combos available, or you can order by the pound if you prefer.

The bucket came out quickly, along with the gumbo and sampler.  First the sampler.  It was fine.  The fries were ordinary fries, no cajun seasoning.  The hushpuppies were a little better and the catfish was pretty good.  To my surprise there were also frog legs.  The waiter didn't mention those!  But it was fine with me.  They're almost a cross between chicken and catfish.  Not a lot of meat though.

The gumbo was better.  Seemed to be reasonably authentic even without the okra.  Some gumbos have okra, but this didn't.  So theirs is a bit more like a soup, which is fine.  It was good.

The combo came out last.  Crawfish, shrimp, sausage, potatoes, and corn.  It was good.  In addition to the bibs they also gave us gloves, which was a nice touch.  One annoyance was that the sauce all runs down to the bottom making it hard to dip your food in the sauce after you've removed the shells.  The sauce is where all the flavor is.

The portion was generous, and we ended up getting two more meals out of it at home.  Overall a solid performance, and 3.5 stars.  But since I can't do 3.5 stars, and they are better than just three stars, I have to bump this one to four."}
{"text":"First off, I love this place. Why? 1. There's no 45 min to 2 hr wait. (Looking at you, Hot N Juicy when I see there's a few open tables.) 2. Our host and waitress were super adorable and kind and attentive. (Still looking at you, Hot N Juicy. Work on being patient and kind especially if we are also waiting 2 hrs.) 3. It's clean, like very clean. 4. (and most important) the shrimps are big. And not overcooked and wonderful and delicious. Their 4-piece sausages were super big. My only downside is the seasoning isn't as great. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came back to try the Cajun Platter and raw BluePoint oysters.  Both were very satisfying to the taste buds.

This is probably the freshest and best tasting fried catfish I had in the Valley and the fried shrimp was delicious.  The french fries here are really good too, and I rarely eat fries but I eat them here.  The BluePoint oysters were very fresh and the flavor was very strong just as if I was on the East Coast seaport towns.

The owner came by every day and asked how everyone was doing.  He said he knew me but I couldn't remember until he said I used to come by his other food places back in 2013.  Oh yes, I remember going to those places.  Good memory.  Real nice person too.

Update 05/08/2018: I came in for the fried soft shell crab basket.  Instead of fries, which is pretty good here, I decided on something healthier so they substituted 2 corn on the cob pieces instead.  

The gumbo was decent 3.5 stars.  The bluepoint oysters were still good."}
{"text":"Mt GF and I came to LA Crab Shack while shopping at local Asian Food Market. We walked in at 6:30, prime dinner time, and the entire restaurant was vacant except for another couple. We were greeted immediately were instructed to pick out any table. Once seated, the waitress came over and offered us water and beverages. The waitress was a little high-strung and over eager, but the service was fast.
You can tell this place was modeled after the highly successful Crab Shacks located throughout the valley. Even the menu was a mirror image of the crab shack.
We ordered oysters on the half shell for appetizers it they came out within 3 minutes. The oysters were clean and tasted fresh, but the condiment arrangement came out frozen. The cocktail sauce came in a plastic container and was pretty much frozen slush. The lemons were rindy and lacked much juice when squeezed.
I ordered 1 lbs of Snow crab and my GF ordered 1 lbs of Shrimp. I ordered mine with spice level 1 and she ordered the max spice at 4. Our order was ready within 5  minutes which was kind of alarming. We did take into consideration that we were the only people there though. My spice 1 crab was overly sweet for my taste. I like spice and savoriness and this order came out with an abundance of sugar. My GF's shrimp had an awkward taste of rosemary and an overpowering floral fragrant taste. We both ordered the same spice mixture, just different spice levels. our marinades did not remotely taste similar. The crab meat itself was cooked well and so was her shrimp.
Our bill came out to $50.00 for a dinner for two which we felt was overpriced for an under-delivered meal. Comparably, this meal would be about the same at Crab Shack, but with a lot less punch.
I think the location of this place is pretty awful and is not easily findable from the street view. A better location with traffic visibility might have made a difference in the customer volume. This coupled with a non-excitable menu resulted in a subpar dining experience.
I would go again to maybe try something different, but I definitely would not go out of my way. I gave it 3 stars because the service was prompt ad the crab was cooked well, but the flavors were not on point and the frozen condiments were unappealing."}
{"text":"Very similar to Angry Crab. Went on Easter for dinner and it was not crowded at all. Not sure if people just don't know about this place yet or what, but we really liked it! It's the same concept where you order #lbs of seafood and peel/crack at your table. What we liked better than AC was the combos they offered. We got combo D which had two lbs of shrimp, one lb of snowcrab, one lb of mussels, and corn, sausage, and potatoes - all for $50! Another positive: the seasoning in the seafood isn't as oily as AC so we didn't feel super full and greasy after eating all that. I would just want a little more flavor in the seasoning. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I normally go to a different place to get my fix of crawfish, but this time my friend insisted that I give this place a try. I'm so glad I took his advice, because this place was amazing!!! Crawfish is in season so there we had the option to get live crawfish or the frozen ones. The sauce was on point. I like their sauce here better because it's less garlicky. The oysters were also delicious. My sister ordered the fried catfish basket and oh boy it was so good. The catfish was crunchy on the outside but yet very juicy on the inside. I wish they would open one out on the Westside because that's where I live, but I won't mind making the drive out here for the time being!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here at recommendation of a friend. Service was sub par. Waiter greeted us and said I'll come back and get your drink order. 10 mins later he came back and apologized and said \"I was doing something and forgot!\" Wait what? We were his only table! I ordered ice tea and they didn't have sweetener. What restaurant doesn't have sweetener? My husband ordered Fat Tire. Waiter came back and said they were out. 
Ordered a pound of shrimp w corn. Shrimp arrived w no corn. My husband ordered fried shrimp and fries. He said it was okay. Not great. 
I don't know how this place will survive. So sorry we didn't go to Angry Crab!! Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Fabulous! The seasonings were on point. It wasn't so buttery like angry crab! The seasoning isn't overwhelming and everything tasted fresh. We got Cajun fries as well and it wasn't too drenched with the seasoning salt. I like that this place is open and spacious and has a lot of natural light coming in. It's very sleek and clean, and has that pirate, seaside feel in decor. Overall I'd definitely recommend to come here! It's fairly new so it's not as busy as big places like angry crab or hot and juicy yet but I feel that this place has potential and will grow if they get the right customers spreading the news about them out. 

The bathroom is pretty cool because of two things, (ladies restroom) there is a shell mirror! And also the faucets light up. That's pretty cool! I like attention to detail. Definitely give this place a try! It's not too bad with price as well!"}
{"text":"I haven't had frog legs since I was a kid back east, so when we saw LA had them it was time to give them a try.

As it turned out my wife enjoyed a lobster side with a bowl of gumbo while I had the frog legs (helped my wife by taking one of her lobster tails) and some gumbo.  

All of our food was very tasty, fresh, hot, and the service was timely.  As Arnold said, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"All of their seasonings are awesome!! Our family's korean so we are usually picky about things that are overseasoned or under seasoned but LA crab shack does it perfectly!! We got the shrimp, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with the house blend and Cajun seasoning! Perfect. Service was also super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"soooo, let me tell you if you like angry crab this is same thing or even better ! their customer service it's great and the place is clean and fresh. highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"The service was good, however the food was not amazing. We ordered a combo from the menu, which consisted of crab, mussels, shrimp and the corn, sausage, and potatoes for sides. The whole bag of food was completely over cooked and mushy."}
{"text":"2nd Time here and we will back AGAIN! Awesome service and the food is pretty great too! Usually we are \"Hot n Juicy\" fans but when we don't wanna make the drive out to Tempe we go to Angry Crab.... after having LA Crab Shack we won't be going back. The food is seriously over the top, the baked bread and steamed rice are the icing on the cake especially when mixed with the hot crab shack blend. That seasoning is so flavorful. You can tell there's love coming out of that kitchen. The owner came out and talked to us tonight as we sat 30 minutes past the closing time and the server didn't seem to bothered by it either which made for a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow what a disappointment!  My dad loves fried seafood. And this place was very very bad. Plastic cup for my margarita. Plastic spoon for the gumbo, which arrived at my table in a to go container with a tacky lid.  $6.99!  We ordered the appetizer combo for $17.99 to decide what to eat. We waited 45 minutes. The tables that were dirty when we arrived were still dirty when we left an hour later. 

No red beans and rice at a Louisiana \"restaurant\"? 
Over breaded everything!  Onion rings I love and I had to tear off half the breading. 

The frog legs were cooked perfectly and were under salted to the point of embarrassment. No salt on the tables. 

I will never recommend or return here. If I wanted to go on a picnic I would not take this food. They charge like they have plates, glasses, silverware, and service. We had NONE of those things. I had to ask 3 people for a check so we could escape and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decided to pay this place a visit as I was in the mood for seafood. Similar concept to that of a regular seafood boil. Decided to try there combo special as yelp had a coupon for a seafood sampler with purchase of the combo platter. Consisted of 1 lb of shrimp, 2 lb of crawfish, and 6 clams. You get to choose your own sauces, but downside of the two sauces chosen was filled with garlic and a bit spicy for medium, more or less tasted like hot (trust me I have a palette for spicy food, but this was way too spicy). Received the sampler it was good nothing special about it though the hush puppies were great. Now when we received our combo, I realized they put all the seafood in one bag  and didn't separate them out as we asked. Wasn't a problem though as they accommodated us with another fresh batch of the flavors asked. As mentioned, the two sauces chosen were filled with too much garlic, but one flavor was really good called \"sate\" which consisted of Asian flavors such as lemon grass. 
Overall the food was okay, nothing exciting that you can't try from another seafood boil. I would come back again but only to try the sate flavor, which was phenomenal. Owner was nice, give this place a try to support local businesses. They just opened a little over 3 weeks ago."}
{"text":"Ask for Mike. Prepare for launch!

This visit knocked it outa the park! I went with my Big Homie Brian... as a continuation of our Old-Basketball-Dads adventures.

I walked in and was immediately greeted by a smiley face that guided me to a table with an excellent view. B walked in shortly thereafter, making his smooth way over to the table. I wish I could carry that off, but I'm ethnically predisposed to mediocrity in that regard. Irritating. Anyway...
 
Mike, our server, came over... friendly, knowledgeable, extra-mile kinda guy and was that way through the whole night. Mike is awesome... and then some... yeah I said it. 

Mike got a me a sample of the various heat levels of the seasonings. I went Crabshack Blend #3 (hot). It was tasty and the perfect intensity of spice. Loved it... although, word to the wise, know what your getting into: my wife gave me the stink-eye when I got home due to the garlic on my breath. Cast out from the bedroom. Banished to the couch. Worth it.

I got the Combo \"B\", that's 1lb. o'Snow Crab, 1lb. o'Shrimp, 2 lbs. o'Crawfish and 2 half corn cobs, 3 potatoes, and 4 sausages. Yowza! Oh, and I gots me a Dungeones crab too. They had to roll me out. And I was rollin' with a smile on my face. 

The manager/owner came by several times to check on us. B and I were solving all the world's problems and basking in the glow of the experience. 

So, friends and neighbors, the capstone of the evening, beyond the awesome food, family-style service, and good company, was the gloves. Gloves, you say? Yes gloves. LA Crab Shack gives you surgical-style gloves at the beginning of your meal. And, Baby, you're going to appreciate them.

Stellar night. Going back for sure. Thanks Mike, see you soon."}
{"text":"Delicious fried catfish and oysters! We also had a pound of mussels in garlic butter. I'd suggest that you pull all of them out when the bag comes or the last ones are too garlicky to eat. Other than that the mussels were perfectly cooked! The gumbo was good, my mama would have added more roux but it tasted right. I'm from Louisiana."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona and looked up some cousins I hadn't seen in a while. They suggested LA Crab Shack for dinner and I'm so glad they did. We had a fabulous time. The food was great, as were the drinks and service. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service and love the ambience of this place!!! Will come here before ever going to Angry Crab!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo happy we found this place. The food was super delishenjoyed the ambience with great service. Definitely worth checking out BTW way better than angry Crab"}
{"text":"Amazing! I came here on a Wednesday night at around 4:30 and there were only like 2 tables occupied.

I ordered 1 lb of king crab legs, 1 lb of shrimp with sausage, Abita purple haze (draft), side of rice, and half a dozen happy hour oysters. That was a lot of food for one person but I was still able to eat most of it because it was THAT good :)

The waitress was super attentive and brought a bucket to put all the shells, bibs, and even gloves which was much appreciated.

I got all of the seafood with the house blend sauce and it was bomb. The waitress told me that the hot was really hot so i decided to get medium and it was actually pretty decently hot. I also liked that the sauce wasn't overly oily which made it perfect for me to dip some rice in :)

The highlight was definitely the king crab legs. I've gone to boiling crab and other places where sometimes the crab isn't super fresh and the meat inside shrinks. But these crab legs were really fresh and there was actually a lot of meat for a pound.

The oysters were pretty decent also for happy hour and came with cocktail sauce and horseradish."}
{"text":"Went here for something different and OMG!!! The fresh Crawfish were HUGE!! A lot of work but the reward was well worth it!!! Huge portions and fair prices! They use real sausage instead of that over processed junk from a mass production like the angry crab. They also use REAL FRESH garlic in their boil in a bag!!! The other place uses just the garlic powder!! I was so pleased with the overall experience! I will definitely be back! The service was also top notch!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a combo with 2lbs crawfish, shrimps and clams and also Hush puppies. The hush puppies were hot on the outside but cold in the center so the waiter had them re-fried for us. The taste is good. However, we were not happy with the seafood itself. The crawfish was not frozen but definitely tasted like they were not fresh so are the shrimps and clam. I love seafood and I usually eat a ton of them. However, we left almost a pound worth of food left. The sauce is ok...could be better. We probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"I love this crawfish , bigger and fesher than other store. The cajun sauce is great. service is fast . I only wait 10 mins to have the food"}
{"text":"I took my family here for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loved it. She complimented the flavor saying that it's one of the best that she'd had in a while. Would definitely come back here and recommend this place for my friends and family. Get the crab shack blend flavor, it's their signature and asks their most popular, i could see why as well!"}
{"text":"Just opened!!! Awesome food! Just opened today! Char Grilled oysters and shrimp boil (or other seafood with crab choices too) pick your seasonings, sauce, sides....YUMMY!!! Open until 10pm! Dobson and Broadway!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was so nice. This place is clean and is decorated nicely. The food is average. I liked the lemon pepper fries more than the crab. I'm sad cause I wanted to love this place since it's cheaper than Angry Crab. I didn't. Angry Crab takes the win. My husband did like their sausage"}
{"text":"We enjoyed live crawfish and shrimp and great as usual. First time for shrimp poboy and fried oysters which were very tasty!  Never disaapointed and awesome service staff every time. This place beats the rest in town and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Brand new seafood spot! I was excited to see that this restaurant had opened up in the AZ International Market plaza. I remember seeing the LA Crab Shack sign above the restaurant when the grocery store opened up but since there were no occupants at the time I wasn't sure if it was an old sign and the business left, or if it was a business to open in the future. Now I know it's the latter!

The menu is very similar to Hot n Juicy Crawfish and Angry Crab Shack. They offer different varieties of seafood by the pound with your choice of sauce and heat level. Oysters, fried baskets, gumbo, and po' boys are also on the menu. We had a group of 6 and we ended up splitting a dozen char-grilled oysters, 2 pounds each of shrimp and snow crab legs and had the Crab Shack blend, lemon pepper, and garlic butter sauce with them.

The oysters came out first. Compared to char grilled oysters I've had in New Orleans, these were all-around a lighter presentation as they were lightly cooked, seasoned, and had a light smoke/grilled flavor. Overall they were decent, but I do prefer the bolder flavors of the ones I've had in New Orleans better. Although we ordered a dozen oysters we only received 11 of them. Someone needs to learn how to count!

The seafood came piping hot in clear plastic bags. My favorite sauce was the Crab Shack blend, a mix of the Ragin' Cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter sauce. At medium heat it still had a bit of bite, but more on the lower end of the heat spectrum for me. Out of the two remaining non-blended sauces I preferred the garlic butter over the lemon pepper since the latter only had dry seasoning on the steamed crab which made it hard to taste the flavor once the shells were cracked open. We did order two sides of sausage which were placed in each of the bags and the lemon pepper tasted odd with the smoked sausage flavor but went well with the other sauces.

Service was friendly and attentive. The manager came by to make sure we were having a good time and let us know to tell him if there are any improvements to make since they just opened.

Since you will inevitably be a briny, oily, spicy dribbling mess (Even with the bib) after you eat they do have a washing station right outside the restrooms.

We ordered 4 lbs. of food + oysters and 2 orders of sausage for essentially 5 people (One person had primarily a po' boy) and we all still felt hungry (But for something non-seafood like) after our seafood bonanza so I'd order more than what we did if you want to walk out of here feeling full.

The only other criticism is I wish the tables were a little bigger so it's easier to share your seafood bounty with your party. It wasn't overly cramped but it did become hard to find a place for the paper towel roll, two buckets of discards, a platter of oysters, and 3 bags of seafood.

Overall we all had a good time and I'd love to come back again to gorge on more seafood!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service! Went to LA crab shack on Valentine's Day cause everywhere else was packed and I was so impressed. Our server was super sweet and accommodating and the food came out how I asked. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The taste of the food and service here was great! I ordered lb of shrimp with the LA blend and 4 sausages, medium spice level, my husband ordered a lb of crab, Cajun with a mild spice level.  We also had the lemon pepper fries which were so yummy.  Our waitress was very attentive.  The reasoning for the 3 stars is because later on that night, we were both sick, and another person in our party who ordered one of the bags like us, was also sick.  The other two people in our party who ordered fried foods were okay.  So I would be cautious of this place which sucks because the food was really good."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice so far and will be back! Crawfish in the house blend is HIGHLY recommended! Dinning area is clean and trendy."}
{"text":"Called in for a take out order and got the fried softshell crab and fried oysters and Cajun fries and my order was ready within 7 minutes. The seafood is fried in batter with cornmeal and the flavor was a little lacking. The fries were not good. Overall a mediocre experience, but I'm going to come back and try the boiled seafood."}
{"text":"Have been here about 7 or 8 times now and this restaurant is our new \"go to\" spot when we went crab legs, fried catfish or fried shrimp! The servers are very attentive and the food comes out of the kitchen very hot and very fast! The owner usually comes around to check on everyone's meal. The margaritas are $3 during happy hour I think. They are small, but pretty good margaritas on the rocks."}
{"text":"Holy smokes.  Sooo good.  Lots of choices to customize your boil, gigantic dungeonous crab.  They give you gloves and have a hand washing station.  Waitress was awesome and gave us a lesson on how to eat the entire crab.  Kevian provides excellent service.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the chef can truly cook the best sauce. Fast and efficient , best seafood restaurant ever. I would order a pound of crawfish, a pound of king crab and soft shell crab basket and you should be good!"}
{"text":"We cheated on our \"go to\" angry crab....we opted for shrimp house blend medium spicey..waitress said they were out of bread
Very disappointing... but offered steamed white rice (tbd)
Iced tea and waters were good good.. consistently filled and satisfying....boom the food arrived and joy of joys she said the bread arrived.. it was a warm soft baguette.. excitied!
We dove in... the shrimp are noticeably larger.. the sauce pungent with garlic... for whatever weird reason we struggled a little to peel them.. it could have been our eagerness to devour!!
The spice was perfect medium.. the winner was the rice... we dripped the sauce from the bag cut the sausage slices and wowie wow wow!!! The corn was saturated with spice.. the sliced sausages absorbed the spice and wss Smokey delicious!!!
All in all.. the stars are for real.. i think i have a new favorite, i will return to make sure!!!!"}
{"text":"The server kevian was amazing. It was our first time eating here so we were super excited but was a little confused on what to get. She explained the whole menu to us very well and advise us to the perfect combo combination that fits both of our seafood favorite which is combo C. Portion was big. Feeds all 3 of us. the spices on them was perfect. They have 5 level of spiciness. We also tried the fried seafood basket. Best frog legs I've ever had. Usually when I go to a Cajun seafood its very bland but this place was so favorable. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor! The food was good, I ordered the shrimp with the crab shack blend and my friend ordered the crab legs. My margarita lacked flavor but the happy hour wine made up for that. My only recommendation would be to have the servers right down orders. We were brought and charged for, corn, and sausage we didn't order. Aside from that we will be back."}
{"text":"We frequent Angry Crab & decided to try a new place. 

We were seated by what I assume is the owner (he came to check on us later as well and looked genuinely concerned about if we were enjoying our meal). 

It's SO much quieter than Angry Crab. It was nice. No blasted birthday alarm going off every 20 minutes, nobody yelling at a football game. 

Decor was kind of a Caribbean vibe, complete with Jack Sparrow statue. 

$5 margaritas, $3 beers - what?! Reasonable drink prices? Amazing. We had oysters, king crab and snow crab. All was great. Came out really quickly and hot. The mild sauce had just enough kick. When asked for lemon, the server brought us a plateful, which was appreciated - can't stand when they just bring you one wedge. 

Our bill was at least $15 less than it would have been at AC. Um, yes please. 

The only tiny things keeping the 5th star out are that 
1) the sauce (the one with 3 kinds) wasn't buttery/garlicy enough in taste for being on boiled seafood, if that makes sense. It was very red in color. I don't know what's in it, but yeah. There was plenty of garlic in it that you could smell, but there was something overpowering the butter/lemon. That may just be my personal preference.
2) the margaritas had WAY too much sweet and sour. We didn't bother sending them back, it wasn't a huge deal, but it would definitely behoove their bartender to look into their ratios."}
{"text":"After seeing many of my other Yelp Friends share photos and post great reviews about LA Crab Shack, I made it a point to put it on my calendar to come out and enjoy once I return back in town. 

I've been to the other popular Crab style places here in the Valley as well as the one's in the Bay Area & So Cal where each of the places caters to a specific style. LA Crab Shack caters to a Vietnamese style which is great but our overall experience didn't match but let me explain why... as well as why I'm still coming back!! 

Unfortunately, our issues ranged from slow service, availability and then food preparation. Before I go into more details, I will say that the manager and the staff really tried their best to remedy the situation but it was just one of those nights when nothing going in the positive way. 

The menu is very similar to the other places when it comes to ordering everything by the pound and they have some Fried basket combos that encourage you to indulge a bit. The one thing I would like for them to have would be some bread like a French roll to \"sop up the juices\" but I recognize that's not the style (and that's cool)

We came in a little late in the evening so it was easy to grab a table. They have plenty of TV's on the walls for sports or entertainment and the open windows with it sitting in the corner plaza are great as you can people watch from the inside (or outside).

To start, we ordered the margaritas and cold beers. We then followed it up with an order of Gumbo, 1lb of Shrimp (flavored with Lemon Pepper), and 1 Dungeons Crab (about 1.5 lbs, flavored with the Crab Shack Blend) with some added sausage.

It took a moment for the margaritas to arrive but the beer was quick (learned our server was pulling double duty as the bartender). Then our server came and told us the Gumbo was done for the day after about 10 mins... We were like, oh noooo... but then a few moments later, surprise, they had a bowl for us. It was the last bowl, but it was served in a \"to go\" container with the lid which to us meant it's either been sitting for a while or it didn't get placed with someone's \"to go\" order. It was still hot, but not hot from a pot. To sum up, it was good with some nice flavors and the sausage that came with it stood out. Which made me look forward to the sausage I added with my boil bag.  After downing my 1st Margarita, it took forever to flag down and get the 2nd one and when it arrived, it was horrible... it had no flavor and tasted like something else water down lime juice and cheap tequila...

Shrimp arrived and no complaints as we enjoyed the flavor but instead of getting our Crab we got a 1lb or 2 of Crawfish... Neither of us are fans of Crawfish so when I finally was able to get the server & the owner, they worked to fix the situation. Told us to go ahead and enjoy it while we waited on our Crab (at no charge), but I can't eat something I don't like (free or not).... So it was wasted... or it went to another table where they were looking at us saying \"THANK YOU\".... So now no Crab and we have to wait and I'm starving... When the crab does come, I crack open a claw and get some meat... tasted a bit too fishy. We cracked open the body and realized, yeap... not cooked thorugh leaving everything really mushy and yucky. The crab was a dungeous crab at over 1.5lbs so it requires more cooking time than a blue crab or other seafoods... Given that we got Crawfish 1st, we believe the order got mixed and they pulled the crab too early to make sure we didn't wait longer than what we waited. 

At that point we were pretty much done. The manager and server were really tentative to try and resolve the issue so I want to give them credit for that. We were still hungry so ended ordering the lemon pepper fries and he brought us some additional sausage and potato. We weren't charged for the crab and few extras but it was clear that our 1st experience wasn't good. The owner's engagement to try and correct the problem as he saw it going south is one of the reasons we will come back. 2.5 stars but because the staff & owner were truly concerned I gave 3 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and fresh! The catfish was seasoned well and the fries are great! Hush puppies were also amazing I would recommend this place to all people who have a craving for seafood! I will definitely be back to this place! I can't decide which is better from the many comparisons from here and angry crab!!! They are both yummy!"}
{"text":"The sauces here for your seafood is better than angry crab and hot n juicy. They use tons of garlic, which I like. 

The sides on the otherhand needs improvement. Cajun fries are thin but there is barely any seasoning on it so you barely taste the cajun. The other fried sides are all ok and nothing great because the breading used is quite bland (I tried the sampler platter). 

Basically, the sides here aren't that great but the main attraction - the cajun seafood is the best in the area. Oh, and the service was great as well.

Edit: I came back again and tried the crawfish, shrimps, clams, sample platter, and a dozen oysters with my company. I still think the cajun seafood here is still the best in the area. One thing I really hope management changes is the oysters. The oysters here is plump, which is good, but taste extremely flavorless. This is the second time I got the oysters and it taste just as flavorless as the first time I got it. If you want to know what is considered a good oyster, try the one at Angry Crab. If you want to know what a GREAT oyster taste like, try the one at Casey Oyster house. The oyster here taste like nothing. Overall, still a 4 star for serving great seafood. Things that needs to be improved is better cajun fries and better oysters."}
{"text":"WHAT'S HOOKED? ME OR THE FISH?
I'm telling you now, a salted and limed Corona and some crawfish is the best thing since sliced bread.

If you really knew me, you'd know I pretty much dislike any kind of food that I have to peel at or work for (#laziness). Honestly, I really wasn't all that hyped to come to a crawfish shop, but I took one for the team. So, the normal thing for me to do when visiting a restaurant such as LA Crab Shack is order Cajun fries, tenders or other easy-to-eat foods. 

As we browsed the menu, we started off with Oysters (so fresh!), Calamari and of course a Catfish Basket with lemon pepper fries,so so so yummy. Although I'm not crazy for crawfish, everyone else loves crawfish, they ordered a load of em'. We also got the Combo A (35.99 before tax) which comes with  2 pounds crawfish 1 pound shrimp, 4 sausage, 3 potatoes, 2corn, and 6 clams. We got the House Blend Medium, I thought this was perfect because we got to try a little bit of everything. I usually pick at the crawfish and sides to fit in with the \"crawfish fanatics\" then \"BAM\" flavors everywhere. The sauce is AMAZING. I started to pick at the sausage and the shrimp and next thing you know I was pretty into the crawfish and I couldn't stop eating it! It was so delicious!

Since the first time, I also tried the Gator Basket and the Gator was sooo buttery, yum!

I deducted a star because the first time I was there, it was almost like we had to ask for everything, and by the time we got what we needed, we were done with that particular dish. For example, our waiter had brought out our oysters, but no lemon, no salt/pepper, no horseradish or cocktail sauce. It took a really long while after our request for it and we had started to pick at our food. In my mind, this was annoying because these usually come with the oysters unasked. Another thing is that the sauce was inconsistent, and this has ONLY happened ONCE so far in the couple times I've been here. We ordered the same sauce and same spice for our crawfish (which was delicious) and clams, but the clams came out cringe-worthy salty. 

Pricing is pretty decent, average for a crawfish restaurant.

Honestly, with the deducted star, I'd still come back, it was still a better than average experience and the place is so pirate/sea themed it's so cute, roomy too! In fact, I've been back twice since, all in under a month. I'd say I'm a bit obsessed, or hooked I should say! ARGGHHH MATEY!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food and staff were great. Loved the food and it was reasonably priced. Happy to have a good Cajun place in this town. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. They gave me the wrong order but they called right away to let me know that I got the wrong one. Since I was close to home already when I realized they have been trying to get hold of me, they rectified the situation by letting me keep the order that was given to me by mistake and gave me my actual order which was 4 lbs of shrimp! The mistake was a blessing in disguise because my husband and I do not really like crawfish at all but their crawfish was really juicy and tasty! And we got to try their clams which my daughter loved with some corn, sausage and potatoes too! Their house blend is not as greasy as the other place we used to go to. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The soft shell crabs were the real deal.  The catfish was thin and crispy.  The shrimp was good but not great.  Service was off the chain good. The price was unbelievable.  Enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"We had the combs A with 2 lbs clams and side of fries! The waitress was adorable and the food was great! The sauce was \"saucy\" and my seafood was drenched in sauce great Cajun goodness !!!!!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. Like others, I have to compare it to Angry Crab and Hot n Juicy...and the boiling crab. 
Service was great. Wish they were more attentive with drink refills. But they're newly opened. So they have some kinks to work out. 
We got the free fried sampler so I had my first experience trying fried frog legs. Lol. The only thing is I wish they added some seasoning to the corn meal batter because it was bland. 
Oysters were from the gulf. They were plump and fresh. I could have easily have a few dozen of just those. 
Something different they do compared to the others is they had combo bags. So we got the snow crab, 2lbs crawfish, 1 lb shrimp. 
Snow crab was tiny in size. Crawfish was big but kinda mushy. Shrimp was good. Also some were mushy. I am not a seafood pro but I think the mushiness was because they were overcooked? 
The combo sauce was delicious. Big garlic chunks. Not sure if we will be back. Like the others, it's somewhere to go every once and awhile. Too pricey to go on a normal basis."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place!! Great service and excellent crawfish! Other than the debit card machine going down and ya having to write an out-of-state check, we had no issues! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We did not feel to drive all the way to Tempe for Hot and Juicy so we decided to try this new cajun place near to where we live.  It turned out pretty good!    

Pro: We ordered shrimp, oyster and sweet potato fries.  The shrimps are fresh and big.  And their sausages are JUMBO sized.  We got our food in 5 minuets.  The owner was super nice about switching our orders.  And the most important thing is, we eat pretty spicy at home, like eat raw jalapeños without hesitation spicy.  Their inferno level spicy actually got me sweat a little bit.  That's a big plus!  In terms of the quality of the food, and service overall, We think here is better than H&J.

Con: We both think the shrimps are lack of a little bit butter flavor."}
{"text":"It's legit! The shrimp are huge, the combo bags are amazing bc it gives you variety. I did the mild with house blend and it was a little on the sweet side but enjoyable. The kids got shrimp baskets they were good as well!"}
{"text":"We brought a party of 8 for dinner on a Friday night. All but one got queasy/sick, and one had all-out food poisoning complete with diarrhea and vomiting after we ate here. We had the seafood appetizer that came with a yelp check in, oysters, crawfish, crab, shrimp, fries, even chicken tenders and seafood gumbo (which by the way came out room temperature- not even warm!). Their flavorings is nothing like Louisiana style cajun seafood....but more like the style of Angry Crab or Hot n Juicy (which both taste better and we never got sick after eating at those establishments.) I'm so disappointed that we all got sick. :-( I really wanted to like this place). When I get the courage to,  I'll come back again. 2 stars for the decor and waitstaff. If not for that, I'd give 0. You don't pay money to get sick. Blegh."}
{"text":"Ughhh so bad .. I am an avid sea food lover . My usual go to is angry crab shack and we decided to try this place and very disappointed . We ordered the shrimp basket for an appetizer I will admit this was delicious. Then for dinner we got king crab which we were shocked was very fairly priced . However we found out very quickly why it must be priced so low. It was awful . The crab already had slits in it and the shells were mushy and so soft , I don't know about you but I like to \"crack\" my crab. The crab tasted \"fishy\" and had what I call \"blowouts\" inside which is a buildup of nasty white creamy stuff when crab gets freezer burnt  or is cheaper wholesale crab.  And for just me and my bf it was 75$!!!  I get it it's sea food but holy crap ... won't be back. Service was incredibly slow too."}
{"text":"A place for the seafood lovers! I dined in on a Sunday afternoon, maybe between busy hours because there were only two tables in the restaurant. Both tables looked very happy and satisfied. The one I sat near was making the craziest sounds of pleasure lol I sat myself as the only visible server was busy with his party of 5. It was about 5 minutes before my server, Keyan, came out. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful with the menu. She explained all the sauces to me. In the end I ordered a pound of shrimp with the house blend sauce and a soft shell crab basket. Keyan let me know they were using baby blue crab for the basket. Yum! I would come back for the softshell crab alone! It had a light cornmeal breading and was the perfect amount of fried. The first bite was hot, crispy, and juicy all in one! So so so good! The shrimp was also delicious, plump and perfectly cooked. The house blend sauce was just okay, in my opinion. I went with a 1 on spice, still gave a little bit of heat, the kind that takes longer to show itself, but nothing unbearable. I'll kick it up a notch next time. I didn't like how thick the sauce was but the flavor was decent. Almost a little sweet. The best part about the shrimp was the heads! I did find a few soft shrimp that I didn't eat. They were just too mushy. I still can't get over that softshell crab though! Overall a solid 3.8 star haha. The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was great. Definitely a step up from Hot n Juicy!"}

I'm liking this place!  Our waiter Troy was excellent, the owner was friendly, and the combination specials are worth taking a look.  The two of us got the Combo A [$35.99] to share which had 1lb. of shrimp, 2lbs. of crawfish, and six clams.  Pair that with the Happy Hour $1 oyster AND the Facebook check-in special for a free Cajun Sampler and we were practically rolling out to the car.

- HH $1 Oysters, minimum purchase of six:  These are some solid Gulf Coast Oysters which means they're mild with very little brine and has a very clean taste.  They're pleasantly plump and very soft.

- Cajun Sampler:  Frog legs, gator bites, fried catfish, hush puppies, fried shrimp, onion rings, and fries!  It was a basket of fried cornmeal-battered bonanza and it left me feeling insanely full.  What can really be said about your run of the mill basket of fried goodness?  The Facebook check-in offer is until Labor Day and is redeemed when you order a combo.  The Yelp check-in offer offers a smaller version based on what Troy said.  Regardless, it comes free so why not give it a try?!

- Lemon Pepper Shrimp & Clams:  The lemon pepper sauce is super light to taste.  I do appreciate how fresh those shrimps were.  Most other crawfish boil places has the heads of the shrimp so soggy and mushy that they fall off as soon as you pick them up out of the bag.  The shrimp heads here remained firm!  When talking to the owner, he admitted that the lemon pepper is a bit bland but believes that lemon pepper is in general hard to perfect.  I must agree!  The clams were plump and meaty as well.

- Crab Shack Blend of Crawfish [two corn, three potatoes, and four sausages included]:  The Crab Shack Blend is a mixture of their Ragin' Cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter sauce. So our Combo A stated that it had 2lbs. of crawfish but it seemed like it was a lot more than that.  I couldn't remember if these were fresh or frozen crawfishes but they tasted pretty great . No muddy gills, no dead crawfishes, and the crawfish tomalley was vibrant orange and sweet.  I love me some crawfish!  I can normally take down 2lbs. of crawfish by myself but I was defeated by this bag.  I like how corn, potatoes, and sausages were included and we didn't have to pay extra like other places.  Also, these babies had a ton of garlic on them which made me happy.  No vampires will be coming after me!  Stay away, Edward Cullen!

All in all, I think the bill came out to be $45-something with the HH oyster prices, Combo A, and the free cajun sampler.  For that price and quality, I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This place won't last once it's lease expires. I was glad to to see it land in my 
neighborhood initially.  I wanted to check it out so I got a to go menu last Friday. I went in for the first time on  monday at 2pm to get a sandwich to go. I was the only one in there!!! I told the wonderful hostess that I was going to the restroom before I ordered. I came back and asked if if I could get a Po Boy with oysters and shrimp half and half. We don't do half and half in the most rude head shaking response. I declined to spend my hard earned $15 there. (hospitality business BTW) Once I declined to order and haggle, she thanked me for coming in and using the restroom in such a bitter response I felt like I was an imposition to their business.I have rectal cancer so using the restroom in a timely manner is crucial. I hope to God Sweetie the Hostess doesn't contract this horrible disease."}
{"text":"I think I can speak for experience alone as it being entertaining and comfortable. The staff was all super friendly, the atmosphere is pleasant and the interior appears to be clean and well kept. I was really excited to try another seafood shack in the area aside from some other big name competitors and was not disappointed. Their gumbo was pretty authentic with excellent flavor and pleasantly surprised they have Crystal hot sauce from Louisiana available. I also had a boil and eat shrimp and snow crab. the flavor was incredible but very rich bordering on gut wrenching. Being that I do not eat pounds of butter on a daily basis I noticed a slight tummyache for the remainder of the day in conjunction with terrible garlic indigestion. I'm hoping not by fault of the food quality but richness I'm not accustomed to.  I will return for another go, however knowing what I know now will certainly take it more easy on the sauce. 

PS. Make sure you get a purple haze from Abita, very fruit forward  delicious Louisiana beer."}
{"text":"I love this place, I'm a frequent customer here. I'm here so much the waitress automatically knows what I will order. The owner is a very friendly guy he always makes his way to speak to me and my girlfriend every time we come here. Now as for the food \"EXCEPTIONALLY DELICIOUS\"! The shrimp and crawfish in garlic butter HOT Sauce is my favorite! Honestly all the broiled seafood here is really delicious. I was a hot and juicy customer not anymore since I found this gem of a place to eat! I will always be a die hard LA CRAB SHACK CUSTOMER!"}
{"text":"Great Cajun restaurant but I don't think Angry Crab Shack has been beat yet. Wait staff was super nice."}
{"text":"I noticed this place after making multiple trips to the International market in the same plaza for the past months. Finally, I decided to give this place a try few weeks ago. 

The restaurant is decorated similar to Job Crab Shack. You can clearly tell that the owner has made some effort into decorating up this place (and they did a good job by the way). However, the food was not very impressive. I ordered 1lb of crab legs. They were all tiny with hardly any meat in it. By the time the meal was over, we were still hungry and ended up eating elsewhere. The flavor that were available was not as favorable as advertised. However, prices are affordable and much cheaper than other places I've been. Perhaps that explain what I've got....?

Before we left, the owner did stop by to say hi. We feel bad to let him know that we actually didn't enjoy the meal. I truly hope that things would change from now on and they will make it in this competitive market."}
