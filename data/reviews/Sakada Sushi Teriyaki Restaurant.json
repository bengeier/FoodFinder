{"text":"Great food - great service.  It was quite empty inside, but many were coming to take out.  The make does not have too much rice and has a good amount of fish - unlike many other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've since gone back a number of times, and had a number of different dishes.

A few points:

- Sushi/Sashimi: Good. No really, it's *good*. The salmon sashimi was nice and buttery :)
...And I ordered take-out for four people, and it came out to $39 because of a cash discount. $39?! Who the heck can argue with that?!

- My Dad is a fan of the BBQ shrimp on skewers. So am I. Nom nom...

Definitely a go-to for my fam for Japanese in Pickering. At that price point and quality, it's really hard to argue. No really, I dare you to argue that."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the \"All You Can Eat\" lunch for $11.99 per person on July 3, 2013 around 1:20pm. The restaurant wasn't very busy. All You Can Eat is advertised from 11:00am-3:00pm. The waitress seemed nice at first. Our food was hot and better than expected. 

I asked for ice, extra lemon and had to ask her to replenish the ginger and wasabi, I mean no disrespect, this has been the case at the other Japanese Restaurants we've dined. 

We finish our first serving and expected she would return, she didn't. This was about 40 minutes later. She checked on other tables, took walk-in/take-out orders. It seemed she purposely found other things to do not to return to our table. 

I went to the washroom. As I passed by the front, I said to her, we would like to make our second order please. She came with the bill. I told her that we weren't ready for the bill, we wanted to make our second order. This was around 2:15pm. She told us the hours for \"Alll You Can Eat\" has ended. I was of course surprised, then referred to the their All You Can Eat lunch menu and showed her the time that states 11:00am-3:00pm. 

She went and talked to who I believe is the manager. We figured, this was an honest miscalculation of time on the waitress's part. He came over and said the same as the waitress and added that the waitress has been back and forth 20 times getting things for us. I relaxed, smiled and said, I think 20 times is an exaggeration, and said, she came to our table three times, which was when I asked for extra lemon and that was requested during our initial order, I requested that our ginger and wasabi be replenished and ice because my water got warm due to her not returning to take our second order. He told me that their prices are some of the lowest in Pickering. She has been back and forth, back and forth. 

I was unsure where he was going with that, but said, If you are referring to gratuity, I have no problem paying gratuity when I receive good service. I brought to his attention their lunch menu and the time, which was around 2:30pm, which contradicted his claim that the All You Can Eat had expired. He then said, well pay what you want. I decided to entertain that and said, okay then, how about I pay $20. He said, if you pay $20, I'll called the police. I chuckled and thought, if my wife wasn't with me, I'd tell him, call the police. I told him, this is not about the money, it is the principle. You advertise the All You Can Eat lunch from 11:00am-3:00pm and you should honor that. 

I paid him the $26, he brought back my change and repeated that the waitress was going back and forth, and their low prices. My wife said to them, we were sitting here waiting for the waitress to return but she didn't. I thought to myself, my wife and I have more class than this, I'm done. I said to my wife, honey, let's go, while he was still talking. I said to my wife, how's that for adventure. We had a good laugh afterwards. 

That was the worst customer service I've ever seen. We will never return to this restaurant. 

I hope my review is helpful. 

God bless,

{"text":"Great local place! We've dined in and taken out and have never been disappointed. Good food, pleasant service, large menu, and very timely. Would recommend in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to find this place so close to home, even though it took me a while to finally visit... It has great value and an extensive menu! I was a big fan of the chicken katsu (chicken cutlet with katsu sauce) and enjoyed sampling the sushi my wife ordered. I would definitely recommend for takeout or dine-in (wifey got confused and we forgot to tip... will make up for it next time). My only suggestion is that the chicken cutlet be cut into larger pieces. That's mostly a recommendation of nostalgia though, my favorite plate lunch place in Hawaii (BBQ Kai) cuts their chicken katsu into larger pieces. Otherwise... Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price. Ordered 4 orders of the salmon rolls and 2 orders of the chicken teriyaki rolls and it came in under $20."}
{"text":"Had take out bento box. It was really tasty. And reasonable. High school floods the restaurant at lunch weekday but they handled the rush. It was my first time but I'll go back"}
{"text":"SAKADA! SAKADA! SAKADA! Cheapest sushi place in pickering, but still top notch! My favorite thing to get there is the Crab sushi pizza. A yummy deep fried crispy rice base, with crab and spicy mayo on top...mmmmmmm. 
Lunch specials are so great because it's like $5 for 12 pieces of sushi. 
Sakada kills it in all ways! But try to refrain from going around 11-12 because that's when the high school kids swarm like it's the watering hole. 
All in all, sakada has amazing service and is always there to perfect the Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"You know what? I come here FAR TOO OFTEN for this not be on my 5-star list. The service is always fantastic and the food is always fresh and prepared nicely. I love this place. 41 check-ins to date and I still had them sitting at a 3-star? Shame on me!"}
{"text":"This is the third consecutive day of grabbing sushi from this spot. They have a $5 lunch deal, 2 rolls (12 total); such a great deal! And the sushi is really fresh. I will say, it's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it is really good and well worth the price. 

They have great bento boxes for both lunch and dinner. Their spring rolls are the bomb. 

My fiancé loves their chicken, beef and salmon teriyaki, whereas I'm not a fan. The salmon is quite thin, their beef is chewy and their chicken has an off taste to me, but he swears by it so, I guess you can make your own call on it. 

Great student specials, and you don't even have to be a student to get them, or maybe you do and they just think I'm a student, not sure."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever! I right this review as I'm waiting for my bill it was so bad, I rather go to the mall or to metro next door and get some sushi.

Rice had too much vinegar making it very sour, the rolls fell apart, the seaweed was chewy as if they tried sealing the sushi with water? 
I had their teriyaki it tasted like they used pure soya sauce, so salty and not sweet at all. I'm still have room for more but I couldn't fathom eating another piece from this restaurant.

Although the food was terrible I wouldn't give a 1 star review just because of that, let's talk about the service! If you can call it that.. Did I mention I was writing this review as I was waiting for my bill? Still no bill! I ordered my appetizers and sushi/maki, my appetizers came in about 10 mins and I was sitting waiting for my sushi/maki for 15 mins before she asked me if I wanted anything else - YES MY SUSHI!!! They forgot and lost the order so I had to reorder everything. After waiting for over 30 mins for my first order of sushi it's was horrible, yuck!

Not to mention extremely limited menu.

I'm still waiting for my BILL! Since I've been sitting here for over 20 mins waiting I guess I'll just walk up and ask for it... 

To sum it up if this was the last place on earth to eat I still wouldn't eat here again.

P.s they automatically add a 15% tip."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are really nice and courteous. 

The sushi is basic and the usual but the prices are the most attractive incentive that brings me back to this place time and time again. 

My fiancé and I will spend $25 with tip and be stuffed! Great value"}
{"text":"I actually didn't know this place existed until I had a pamphlet delivered to my house. The dinner bento boxes are what really caught my eye. $12.99 is a great price and on top of that, the variety and combinations available for the bento boxes made me pick up the phone to order. With a lot of other sushi places you're limited to one main meat choice (example: salmon OR chicken OR beef) but Sakada offers options like chicken teriyaki AND salmon in one box that falls under the $12.99 price. The boxes at Sakada also came with a miso soup, green salad, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, 6 pieces of california roll (cucumber, avocado, crab meat, fish eggs), and 2 spring rolls - just an absolute mountain of food. I've noticed that other restaurants will provide one of either sashimi or a roll and when a roll is offered, it's usually just a cucumber roll or plain salmon roll. The fact that both sashimi and a maki roll were offered was awesome. There was also no \"filler\" item like fruit which I thought was great.

I ordered for take-out and was quoted an estimated time of 15 minutes for 2 orders of bento boxes. My food was immediately ready for pickup when I arrived and the staff were friendly. 

When I started unpacking my food, I could see the care taken to prepare my take out order. For fried items, steam holes were cut into the boxes and a layer of oil absorbing paper was laid underneath. The food was also looked appealing - it looked fresh and was laid out nicely - it reminded me of what it might look like if I dined in. This might not be important to a lot of people but it's nice to see that a restaurant didn't haphazardly throw together my food because I'm a take out customer and thus the wait staff don't need to work for that tip.

In terms of the taste, everything from the salad to the fish was fresh and tasted great. The teriyaki sauce was flavourful and the dipping sauce for the chicken cutlet was awesome too. The chicken cutlet was crispy and wasn't over battered. I'll definitely be coming back here. 

Overall great Japanese option in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever, better off going to the mall for sushi.

Rolls fell apart, rice was bland, miso soup was watered down.  Never again.

Pickering desperately needs better sushi options."}
{"text":"I came here again last night for dinner and ended up trying a bunch of different stuff off the menu. This time I ordered the salad, an order of spicy salmon rolls, avocado rolls and the house sakada roll. 

I called my order over and they told me 15 minutes; so about 15 minutes later I walked in and my order wasn't ready. They weren't even busy, there were two tables eating in and another person waiting for takeout. They did provide me with some magazines to flip through but if they intend to increase their business, they should get used to traffic.

The salad was great, just like the last time, and they had packaged the dressing separately as to not make the salad mushy. The spicy salmon rolls were okay. They weren't really spicy enough, some pieces had good spice and most of them had none at all. I'm not sure what was going on there, but the rolls weren't really wrapped tightly enough and the temperature was weird. I think they were using freshly made rice because they were a little too room temperature. The avocado rolls were good, nice size but same thing with not being wrapped that well. The sakada roll... was different. This was NOT what I was expecting but I tried it anyways. Far too much cucumber on the outside; this is the kind of thing you would order if you had a table of 5 people so that each person only had one. I found that the cucumber overpowered everything else and the spicy mayo that came with it didn't make much sense. I'd avoid ordering this again.

Overall, this was an okay but kind of mediocre experience for my second time around. I probably wouldn't bring my friends here but it will stay in my takeout rotation because I love sushi and its so very close to home. I'll keep trying different things off the menu so don't be surprised to see another update or two depending on what I get."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with my take out order tonight...I ordered the 28 pic sashimi combo asking for no white tuna and told them they could replace with anything else...somehow, they \"forgot\" the octopus too.  (See photos).  The sashimi was decent (being in a plaza in Pickering), but I felt like they totally missed out on the details...need to serve what you state in a menu, unless you sell out, then at which point, advise the customer.
Our first two experience was great; take out then eat in for AYCE.  Good service and decent food both times.
Disappointed about this MISS!"}
