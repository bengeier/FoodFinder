{"text":"There tacos are good. I like their fish tacos especially.
They claim to be open 24hrs on Friday and Saturday, though i have tried a few times to stop in on Saturday mornings around 8am to get a couple breakfast burritos and they have been closed.
I guess I'll never be able to try one of them out."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, all have been a pleasant experience. The lady at the front counter was very nice, and had some good recommendations. Weds has 99Â¢ chicken tacos, that were a lot better than Robertos. I love chile rellenos, and they put it in a burrito, so good. The salsa bar is well stocked, and had good flavor. Prices were reasonable, and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't have any intentions of studying the subtle details of my toilet, but luckily Durango Taco Shop somehow knew my desire for American Standard intimacy. 1 overpriced carnitas burrito = Pure pain and misery. For years I've eaten Robertos without consequence. 1 visit to this establishment had me wishing for death. Wish they invested less in nice TV displays and more in meat thermometers. While I don't wish harm or failure on anyone, if this place catches fire I'm bringing marshmallows."}
{"text":"Durango taco shop is the best new one yet!! Thier tacos are amazing!! Thanks Claudia for having me try the mango drink!! Definitely buying a large next time."}
{"text":"We love the chicken tacos. The chicken is fresh tasting and very moist. We have come frequently since this place opened and it only keeps improving. Keep in mind you are coming to a taco shop; tacos is what they're good at!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos and nice people here I recommend the al pastor. Kids like it too and yummy salsa bar. 
We like the location too close to home"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I am very picky with my tacos. Open 24/7 on the weekends and late on weekdays. The carne asada tacos is great! Love their red salsa! We have eaten here at least once a week since they opened! Do not go here and expect great service. It is togo only so The food is what you're paying for!"}
{"text":"Is Taco Shop is really good the carne asada was very juicy and tender I would definitely be back again my husband had the carnita burrito and he really liked it."}
{"text":"My husband got the super nachos. Dry meat, fake cheese sauce, no jalapenos or pico. All around bland and boring. Also over priced."}
{"text":"Best salsa verde EVER! 2 for 1 tacos on Tuesday and 99 cent tacos on Wednesday! My husband loves the Menudo"}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place opening so close to home. I tried it out and was disappointed. It's overpriced, food was mediocre and the staff need some basic customer service manners. The girl that took my order looked like she wanted to be anywhere, but there!
I'll take the extra 5 minute drive to Jefe's taco shop for great customer service and some of the best Mexican food in town!
Unfortunately, like everything else that's been at that location, it won't last."}
{"text":"99 cent chicken and potato and cheese tacos were awesome! The green salsa, spicy and tasty! Can't wait to get my free taco!"}
{"text":"Says open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday.  Was going to give this place a second chance, first time was so so.  Well 12:14 and they are closed?  I guess only 24 hours when they feel like it.  Del taco here I comd"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted right away! Came in on Tuesday and they have a 2 for one taco special! I haven't eaten yet but once I do I'll write another review! The service was worth writing a review on! 
Oh and super clean which is always nice!"}
{"text":"Garbage. I make better street tacos, and I'm white. I'm used to amazing street tacos like back home in LA. I'll continue to make the drive to Taco Y Taco. I'd give this place no stars if I was able to. I tried asada, carnitas, and pastor... one bite of each and the rest ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"When there today for Taco Tuesday, order two chicken tacos for $2.25 & they wanted another $0.50, for me to get them their money immediately with my ATM card, I left,             the place look like a dive I'll never go back, so they know what they can do with the extra $0.50"}
{"text":"It's okay Mexican food in the NW area. Definitely better than a Roberto's. I love the sopes there. Prices are a bit higher than usual taco shops but you can get good deals on their specials. They also charge a 50 cent fee to use a credit or debit card which is annoying and outdated."}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times now and are always happy with the food and service. Our favorites are the carne asada and chicken tacos ordered by the pound with tortillas. They always accommodate us and have food ready on time when we call in a to go order. I tried a burrito once and thought it was a bit bland but the food tastes fresh and their sauce and garnish bar is great."}
{"text":"Not too bad at all. This place is right around the corner from my house, so I figured I'd try it out. Had the breakfast burrito there and it was certainly one of the best I've ever had! And their prices are very reasonable for what you get. Can't wait to come back and try their street tacos."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Great staff! Excellent tripas tacos! Good prices! I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out a couple of weeks ago. We were so excited to have a taco place near our home. A huge disappointment! The food was bland and the meat was dry. We also ordered there ice cream with a churro. The ice cream was so frozen we couldn't eat it. The woman who took my order was unprofessional and rude. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a grilled chicken burrito. I really don't know what meat I consumed that they called carne asada. It was terrible. Chicken burrito I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced nine dollars for a Borrito not worth it I will never be back food was not good either"}
{"text":"amazing tacos and cashier claudia was suoer nice ill be coming back ... i live far from the location it was recomemded to me by a friend"}
{"text":"The service here is always super slow with very mediocre food. Save your time and money and just go to Roberto's"}
{"text":"Tried to call in my order. I was put on hold for about 8 min. Then hung up on. When I walked in I let her know I was the one she hung up on. She said \"oh I forgot about you, I was busy taking another order\" mind you there was only one other person in the place! The food here is awesome.... but staff definitely needs more training on the customer service!  The people that live near by are the ones that will keep a business running."}
{"text":"So annoyed. I was so happy we finally had a Mexican place around and I hate it . I just got home from ordering a carne Asada torta and it was cold...I like 2 min away . like cold cold. Customer service sucked the cashier was talking the whole time to the cook. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Good food, great customer service and never have to wait long. My kids love the tacos."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican take-out. Extremely limited in how seating. Friendly staff and quick service. The $.99 crunchy chicken tacos special on Wednesday are a great deal! They are tasty and can't beat the price. They have other specials there as well. Very clean establishment, which always means a lot!  I would definitely suggest this place for better-than-fast food, not quite sit down restaurant Mexican food to go."}
{"text":"I've had this food from here since they opened a couple of weeks ago. I recommend it over the other taco places around this area (which aren't many). The tacos are good and the meats like lengua and buche are always available."}
{"text":"Great tacos & service!! Perfect go-to spot for quick food. Their burritos are just as good as their tacos and their prices are good!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place since it was so close to the house. Place had a funky smell and wanted charge .50 to use a credit or debit card. Kinda steep for using a charge card. Algoberto's down the street is cheaper and has better food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a new taco shop, unfortunately they did not meet any expectations. Carne Asada was good, not special by any means. Carnitas were awful! I can't even understand how they screwed that recipe up so bad. Overpriced for sure. They need to revamp their recipes and lower prices or they are really going to struggle to stay open."}
{"text":"Wow this place has bad reviews! In my opinion, they're mediocre overall. They have decent food but depending on what you order, some of the prices are kind of high for a small family owned restaurant. I'd stay away from the burritos or combos for that reason and only order from the tacos and breakfast sections of the menu. 

Their al pastor tacos were pretty good but their super nachos were far from being super. It was mostly chips and not very many toppings. We took it home it threw our own toppings and salsa on it! 

Although they're food is decent, they do have some major issues that I noticed the first few times I stopped by:

1. This is basically a take out only joint because they only have 1 table inside

2. 50 cent fee to use a card no matter how much you order 

3. Received advertisement/coupons in the mail stating that breakfast was served from 5 am to 10 pm, however, when I stopped by one morning at 7:45 am they were closed. Apparently they don't open until 9 am every day!

4. Only open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday despite having a 24 hour sign

Overall based on the convenience factor of this location, and its proximity to several residential areas, I think they're going to give Roberto's a run for their money. However, keeping in mind that every previous restaurant in the same suite went out of business within a year, only time will tell..."}
{"text":"Asked for dine in got served to go and still had to wait 20 minutes for a simple 5-7 minute turnaround. Cashier got mad when I asked for the drink I paid for and she forgot to give me. Algobertos on Farm and Cimarron is way better or possibly Roberto's inside Freddy's. Even after all that the food was crap."}
{"text":"Good eats. A great place to visit if you love Mexican food. Way better then Roberto's."}
{"text":"Very clean very polite and the food is really good with authentic spices. I wish they had more seats but the food and hospitality was great.

Keep it up as my wife and I will be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner from Durango Taco Shop and have eaten here a few times over the past few months. It's always clean and the staff is friendly. The menu is displayed well and it's easy to read/order. The daily specials are always a great option too. Everything is well priced and is a good value for your $$! And of you leave a Yelp review they will give you a free potato and cheese taco!! (Thank you!!) 

The reason for leaving a 3 star review and not a 5 star is because the food has been hit or miss for me. While I love the rolled tacos, the breakfast burrito was more like a bean burrito with egg and the hard tacos are litterally so hard I couldn't bite into it! Ive also had the torta which unfortunately was soggy. I'll update with a new review next visit!"}
{"text":"I know tacos, man. But their street tacos are tiny. Like laughable. I'll give them credit, they stuff em full of meat, but I've never had a tortilla that's been on the grill. Seems like straight out the package. Kinda bummed."}
{"text":"I wish I had tried this place sooner. Very clean and modern Mexican food place. Employees are friendly. Portions are generous and delicious food. This will be my new go-to place for quality Mexican food. Convenient location and decent prices...."}
{"text":"Gross!!! 

I recently moved to the centennial hills area and decided to try this place out. I ordered a quesadilla with guacamole in it since they didn't offer vegetarian quesadillas. The most poor tasting quesadilla ever. Their guacamole tasted like lime and salt. And yes I know guacamole has lime and salt in it but it was extremely excessive. The tortilla tasted no better than store bought. My tastebuds really couldn't get past all the salt, ended up throwing it in the garbage after two bites. Don't waste your money here. \"Los tacos\" or \"frijoles\" are two much better places to eat at. Quality authentic food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here Taco Wednesday and they have tacos for $99cent! They are bomb and the fresh hot sauce was on point!"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and mediocre not a good combination, also they ran out of guacamole . I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Great food as well as great service! 
Gotta try the burritos as well as the frys 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco shops that I have eaten in a while. It's a nice hidden gem on the northwest side of town. My husband who is very picky loved the carne asada tacos. Definitely a must place to eat!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Do not go here. 

They advertise that they are open 24/7 and they aren't. As soon as I got there, I asked one of the employees if they were truly open 24/7 and she responded \"only Friday and Saturday.\"
     - Backstory: sometimes I have to work night shift at work. We heard about this new taco shop opening up that is open 24/7. On two separate occasions, we had a late night food run only to find out that they were closed (as their open 24/7 sign illuminates the window). Additionally, my girlfriend offered to pick up some breakfast tacos for us in the morning after work (~8:30a.m). She got to the shop only to find out that they weren't open  

We went there today and the service was shit. The employee taking our order was rude and rolled her eyes at me at least twice. They didn't have any breakfast tacos. Lastly, their regular tacos were tiny and tasted like eating a tortilla with cat food covered in melted crayons. 

Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Tasty! We went on Wednesday for the .99c chicken tacos. So those weren't the best, I'll be honest. The filling was really limited, the shells were really hard, and it was dry and not good overall. Docked a star for those because we got five. The sope with carne asada was tasty, and the highlight was the street tacos with carne asada and pork. I don't think it was the carnitas...the other pork option. They were super moist and flavorful, and the green salsa made them even better. The service was awesome and our order was ready really quickly. We'll be back-they have buy one get one for the street tacos on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Del taco street tacos are better- my tacos tasted like Chinese food and were so small. Don't waste your time you will be disappointed. Even the meat was hard and tasted old. Not to mention this place is pretty expensive considering the portion size is very small. I have no problem paying more for good tacos, these are just trash."}
{"text":"They have stuff on the menu that they don't carry anymore. The chicken on my sope was rubbery. Gave it 3 try's and probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Thought this might be a good 24hr. taco joint to try. I had left the house early to give their breakfast burrito a try before work, but upon arriving, their door was locked closed, the signs and lights were off, and there was no note or shop hours posted to the door. Kind of ironic staring at a switched-off 24 hour sign through a locked door. One of the cardinal business sins is not valuing your customer's time, and waking up early and walking away hungry is definitely a waste of my time."}
{"text":"We just moved to Nevada and have been looking for a \"go to\" taco shop. We tried Robertos and they would not accommodate our child who doesn't eat meat, gluten or cheese. (He requested a bean taco) I went to Durango Taco Shop last night and Claudia said \"no problem\" and made him a bean taco and also suggested he try the potato taco. We are grateful that they made what he wanted when the other taco shop refused. (Seriously, it's not as if they don't have corn tortillas and beans!)Thank you, Claudia!! We are now loyal customers!! Sheri Patterson and Family"}
{"text":"Finally!   Good street tacos for under $3/ea.  Vegas is getting crazy w/Mexican food prices.   I'll definitely grab and go more often then waiting at the restaurant down the street.  This is way better than the establishment on Farm too."}
{"text":"If I could give less then 1 star I would . The girl taking orders is rude, customer service is terrible . The open 24 hour sign an obvious issue. All could be over looked for good food in a pinch.... Not the case carnitas tacos were terrible . Literally tastes like boiled meat. No seasoning, no flavor, my husband and the El pastor and said his were also flavorless. Was hoping for a closer alternative to Robertos or Jefe's ... no such luck. This place was terrible save your money, tastebuds and time ."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered a couple of fish tacos and a burrito to go.  Just take your food to go as there is a bar counter with 4 seats and 1 four seat table.  Not really good if you want to have a romantic date and all.  

Not entirely sure on the negative reviews and all as  it seems better selections that what you get at a taco truck but better prices than some of the really expensive places in town(E.G. Dona Maria).  The cashier really seemed to know what she was doing in helping explaining any questions I had and checking to make sure that everything was in the bag.

I will say that the flour tortillas for the tacos are really thin and pretty much disintegrated after the first bite so I had to use a fork to get everything else so that is a downer.  But I will say that the food seems as fresh as you will get anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Even though there was a mishap with my order they uber, they made 4 tacos and delivered as soon as possible, and it was so worth the wait! Their asada tacos are bomb.com!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is getting terrible reviews, So honestly we had no plans to even try. Well, we were on our way into Dairy Queen next door & decided to just try 1 carne asada taco. The employees were very friendly! Shocked we were sharing 1 tiny little taco, but still helpful. $2.25 for 1. 
Wow! It was really good! After seeing the bad reviews & ratings, I really expected to not like it. We will definitely be back! They have some great specials we will totally return for. They have now clearly marked their daily hours & maybe they just needed to work out the kinks. Seems they may have done just that!"}
{"text":"Wow. I love there soft tacos! Taste so good. Just writing about it makes me want to come back and eat more.  The burritos here are decent size. Overall it's a good location. Environment was clean when I walked in and good staff members. Good spot to eat some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Always very clean and staff is very helpful. The salsa bar is never dirty and always fresh!!! Highly recommend this spot if you live on this side of Town."}
{"text":"Okay but the tacos al pastor are probably one of the best in town! I got a plain cheese quesadilla as well and the only thing I didn't like was the sour cream, lettuce and tomato included. They had a good salsa verde in the salsa bar too. Reminds me of places back in LA. The prices here are decent, although I'd recommend bringing cash. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Honeslty ive tried about 3 times now with this place and everytime is just meh.

The establishment is very clean and the menu is clear to read. 

But 8.99 for taquitos.. come on now.

Everything is over 8 bucks even 3 street tacos its kinda crazy.

Especially for how bland everything really does taste. 

Hopefully they decide to get a new chef or new recipes... idk somethings gotta change either thr prices or the effort into the food."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean establishment. Got menudo and al pastor tacos ... yum !!  Price and taste exceeded my expectations -highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with hubby. We each had crispy tacos, ( he had beef and I had the chicken). They were made to order, so they were not soggy. The shop has one table and a sidebar. People were friendly. I wasn't thrilled with what I believe was their salsa. But their green sauce was great. We will go back"}
{"text":"Food was good and prepared quickly.  Birria tacos were excellent and the Horchata is self serve! Yes the 24/7 sign is a bit misleading but the food makes up for that.  Its not a five star restaurant but its as good or better than a lot of taco shops."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually go to the Mexican restaurant down the street from this one. We decided to try something different and a little closer to our home. We order two burritos and I sat in the car while my wife went in and got them. 35minutes later our burritos were still not done. We waited so long to get our food. After 45 minutes I went in and asked to speak to a manager. I was told there isn't one on staff and so then I asked for my money back and was told that our food was being made that they can not refund my money. Such a disappointment this local restaurant."}
{"text":"I have never posted a review nor felt the need to.... but if this reviews saves even on person from wasting money or even having to taste what they call carne asada  then it is worth it. I bought a Durango burrito with what was suppose to be carne asada but what I got was a burrito with shredded almost paste like beef. Beside the absolute god awful texture of the meat, it was obviously not grilled and tasted disgusting. I couldn't believe that the owner/ Managers let their employees sell that to people. It's sad how little effort they put into the cuisine. Hopefully, the powers that be see this review and start taking pride in what they do instead of putting dog food on a plate and calling it mexican food. Save your time and money, go to Roberto's which is right down the street and get some food that at least resembles Mexican food. I'm very liberal with money I've never felt so robbed of 10 dollars in my life. Stay away."}
{"text":"Finally got into try this place. Was far from impressed. The meat is gross, the lady taking my order looked like she could care less that we were there. Atmosphere aside the food was not good at all. The Guacamole was old. The meat was squishy, and the food was beyond greasy. Won't waste my money there again."}
{"text":"Place looks nice very up to date on technology, I would have thought it was a chain store, but so so on the food and way over priced."}
{"text":"Went here just to try it out. Good service and clean facility. Nice selection of meats for the dishes. The food however was very bland. It is basically the equivalent of eating Mexican food in the UK. Won't be back.

As an update, I call and ask if I could just bring the food back and get a refund. The woman that answered the phone said that the manager would not be back until Wednesday and he was the only one that could give a refund. This place is a complete waste of time and money. Avoid it like the plague. I will be contacting the manager on Wednesday and letting him know what a total crap hole this place is.

Update to the Update:
i got in touch with the manager and was told that they do not do refunds on the food. He offered to remake it or give store credit. I strongly declined as there was nearly nothing of a $50.00 that was even half decent. This place is a ripoff."}
{"text":"Nice and clean establishment! Will return in the future! Very interested in the crunchy potatoes and cheese taco!"}
{"text":"Simple Menu, Good Street Tacos and Hardshell Chicken Tacos, not very big inside but who cares (seats less than 20); this place is a diamond in the rough!!!! I will never miss another taco Tuesday or Fish Taco Friday... This place has a special almost everyday except Thursday...."}
{"text":"Tried it out first time for Taco Tuesday.
2 for 1 Al Pastor tacos, street style, good smells, I was satisfied! I'm used to my Al Pastor having more pineapple in the flavors & no cucumbers @ sauce bar when I was there. Seems quite clean, authentic Mexican music playing over head. I'd visit again no problem"}
{"text":"Had carne asada tacos. They were good. Salsa had good flavor. Kind of pricey. But they were good street tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place!  By far the best quick Mexican joint I've found west of the strip.  Open late, sometimes 24 hours, and the food is really really good.  They've got a bunch of different meats; lengua, etc, good carne asada fries, horchata and all that.  People keep asking me and yes!!  It's better than Roberto's. It's also at the end of my block, so I'm all in on this place.  

I have to say that tacos el gordo is still my #1 taco stop in Vegas; but this place is a close second."}
{"text":"This place was the worst!!! First of all, the cashier had her phone in shirt & was talking to someone on the phone the ENTIRE time we were ordering. She didn't acknowledge us at all, until I shouted to her for assistance. The soda machine wasn't working & when she finally came out to turn it back on for us, the soda was completely flat. As far as the food, it needed to be AMAZING to make up for the terrible service. It wasn't. Don't give this place business & waste your money! There are plenty of small businesses that deserve your support & work hard for it, this isn't one of them!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited about a new taco shop opening up so close to the house, not to mention open 24hrs on weekends but it was such a disappointment  I ordered a carne asada burrito and a carne asada taco( meat had no flavor) and had a weird after taste. Better off going to robertos. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service and friendly staff. Very pleased. The restaurant was clean and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"is so very good. the cheeseburger is delicious. al pastor burrito is delicious. i'm from san antonio so i know good mexican food and this place is good. nachos were alright"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 tacos to be delivered via GrubHub since I had no way to pick them up. They were on time and pleasant. Open and bite into tacos and I almost crack a tooth. The shredded beef was dry and had hardened on all of my tacos. I called the Taco Shop and told them of my disappointment. They told me the only thing they could do was to make a new order of tacos---but had no way to get them to me since I ordered through GrubHub. When I told them that I had ordered GrubHub for the simple fact that I could not pick them up, the woman at the Taco Shop said that's all she could do. When I inquired about a refund, she reiterated the above once again. I ended the call saying I would never order from her establishment again. I'm sorry I cheated on you, Roberto's--it's because GrubHub doesn't deliver from you yet. But it wasn't even worth it. I feel so dirty and used now."}
{"text":"Pretty good taco shop, tacos are like authentic street tacos, fried roll tacos are on point , nachos are okay. The best part is the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Taco shop to the House and although they had a rough start in the beginning as you can tell by some of the reviews, they're running strong now. Their food is good, the Chile Relleno Burritos, the marinated Al Pastor meat is on point since they use a rotisserie giving it a charred BBQ taste, the chicken is marinated and is very good. They feature a two for one Taco Tuesday and on Sundays there is a 4 Tacos for $5 special either Chicken or Al Pastor. The owner is personable and strives to do the best for his customers. He just mounted a Taco Bar for standing and eating Tacos that just about covers one side of the Taco Shop, a good feature if you're pressed for time."}
{"text":"First this review is not based on taste because i couldnt afford what they were charging. I went there when they first opened. My wife wanted a, pepper burrito with cheese and quac. They tried to charge me, i kid you not, 11 bucks for a burrito with no meat and only pepper cheese and guac. So, the bill, with what i ordered came to 22 bucks. I said ok, cause wanted to try it instead of robertos, which my go to for a Californian. Even though it was for 2 burritos. I said to my self a bit pricey, but what the hell. I give them my debit card and they said its a 50 cent charge. I genuinely was shocked and said to the lady behind the register, \"what is the minimum?\" She said there is no minimun its a 50 cent charge for cards. That was the last straw and went to roberto's instead. I know what ur thinking, why would i not pay the 50 cent? Because i was about to pay 22 bucks for 2 burritos and one of those burritos had no meat. I was not going to pay an ectra dime for take out. I go to roberto's and get food for 4 people for 22 bucks. Thats how i feel about durango tacos. Besides that i do not know how the food taste."}
{"text":"The food is good & so is the service but on two separate occasions there has been a hair in the food that was not ours. It was disappointing because we love the place but sadly we will not be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food... Buy 1 Get 1 Free on Tuesdays... I come here several times a week. Right down the street... Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"Durango taco shop is a good Mexican shop to go to on this side of town. The portion sizes are huge. Whatever you order it will fill your belly. Guaranteed lol. My favorite is carne Assad fries with everything on it with mango pina to drink"}
