{"text":"This place is awesome! Great coffee, great food and Elvis. You MUST try an Elvis!!  I stop by on the way to drop my kids off at school. Call my order in and run in and pick it up!!  Great service!! Seriously love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast sandwich, XL brewed iced T, nice people(new owners?) note: looked for BIG \"COFFEE\" sign in complex."}
{"text":"Things have been nothing short of chaotic lately... Partly due to my grandparents having a handful of health incidents/issues occurring almost simultaneously... Because of this they have not been able to drive their vehicle, so I've been doing basic maintenance for them to keep it in good shape... which called me to discount tire to patch up the nail one of the tires had picked up...  Discount isn't always the quickest so I had to find somewhere to kill some time. I noticed across the parking lot a coffee shop with wraps & sandwiches. Just the thing I was looking for while I wait!!  When I walk in, a couple of regulars are chatting it up with the folks behind the counter; positive conversation and smiles, good music and good vibes are my first impression.   I informed them this was my first time and I was given the run-down on some of their blended espresso drinks and then the gentleman broke down the ingredients in a few different sandwiches for me... All in a very pleasant and patient manner.  I was unaware that I had arrived just before they were closing and even amidst my ignorance on the matter I did not ONCE feel rushed or like I was imposing as some restaurants make you feel near closing time (sometimes, rightfully so... But this was not the case here)  It is safe to say that I RECOMMEND this spot especially if you need to kill some time waiting on some tire service. I witnessed several regulars in the short period of time I was there each one commenting \"See you guys tomorrow!\" On their way out.  All in all. Great blended coffee, delicious bagel sandwich, and comfortable calm environment. I don't live particularly close to this area but I will be getting all of my tires done here so that I can wait over at this coffee spot! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"KAMERON ;) is my favorite barista. He always has a smile on his face, has a fantastic memory. He has the ability to remember your drink and might just have it ready for you when you walk in the door. I personally adore the Matt's Exciting Chai drink wise. A special blend aptly named after a friend & coworker at Roadrunner Pharmacy. But speaking of on the menu if you are doing breakfast the Sonoran Wrap is to die for!"}
{"text":"Awesome independent coffee shop. Family run feel. A lot better than Starbucks and the \"big box guys\"."}
{"text":"They do not look happy or smile like they enjoy life, coffee tastes weird, small stuffy enclosure,  though the colors are stimulating. Pretty sure they sell Costco muffins"}
{"text":"I stop by here several times a week. Always friendly and quick. Awesome coffee and I love that the staff will give recommendations if I'm wanting to try something new. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This is not the same coffee house I originally reviewed.  They have changed ownership and went through this name change to Krazy 4 Coffee.  Original review as for Daisy Mountain Coffee.   Had a coffee card from before name change took place and they told me I had to use it at the other Daisy Mountain Coffee place (another location on Carefree near Safeway and North Valley).  I explained that I was in just two days ago and they were the ones that stamped it.  Same person even. Said sorry.  That was it.  If you want my business take my old card and give me your new one and with the same amount of stamps. They have changed their hours and not quite as friendly as they used to be. Okay but downgrading to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Coffee is ok. I think it great for a little place to stop by in a hurry. I was not to satisfied with the service. I didn't feel that friendly feeling when you come in. It seemed to me that people are not very happy. I would go back just out of convenience."}
{"text":"YUM!  This is literally just down the street from me but I'd never been until last week.  We stopped in for a bite on the way out of town and it was delish.  The dirty chai was fantastic and my egg and cheese bagel was fantastic.  I always lament about not having better food options in this area but this place is great."}
{"text":"I visited this coffee shop for the first time and I'm surprised no one has mentioned it before. Better than Elevate or Dunkin Donuts and have quick service, a wonderful atmosphere, and most importantly...delicious coffee! Usually I'm weary to try iced drinks due to them going overboard on ice, but in my dirty Chai it was well-worn the $4 price! Got lots of coffee and had a great morning out. I definitely will be recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Not very many local coffee shops in cave creek so I thought id give this place a shot. I LOVE that they have almond milk. Just that will make me return. Iced mocha was what I needed on a Sunday. Hubby loved the Dark roast 5 star blend too"}
{"text":"Love local coffee shops! This one in particular has a really great feel to it! There is out door seating and you can order over the phone! There is a huge selection of food! When you walk in, the staff greets you warmly. I got the peach passion and I'm in heaven and I'm wondering why I ever went anywhere else for smoothies! They also have a great selection of coffees as well as a whole section of organic coffee. Love!"}
{"text":"Quaint + cozy shop.  Friendly + wonderful service.  My mom and I split and egg sandwich and oatmeal. The sandwich was yummy + served hot. The oatmeal was the best I've ever had! It came with cranberries, walnuts, and soft brown sugar. The oatmeal had a perfect consistency; not too mushy but not too dry.  My mom had a decaf coffee. I had a few sips and it was some of the best coffee I've had. It didn't need anything added to it. I had an iced \"Snickers\" coffee that was delicious.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fun little place, Always greet you with a smile and a Big Hello! Nice Young Couple owners."}
{"text":"Great to have fresh roasted coffee. Not bitter or burned, very enjoyable. Great breakfast and lunch items too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and awesome food--great assortment of reasonably priced food    Quick service.  Will make custom coffee drinks to order.  Not burnt coffee but fine tasting.  Music at an enjoyable level this time :-)  Thank you!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place with a laid back, comfortable atmosphere. Barista and cook were super sweet and the breakfast sandwich was delicious. Very competitively priced- check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW!! Can I say anymore! This has to be my new favorite place for coffee and breakfast, coffee and lunch, or just because!!! There southwest wrap has to be the best thing since slice pie. So fresh, and delicious you can't go wrong with that! THE COFFEE IS LOCALLY ROASTED! Who doesn't like local? So if you have an itch for coffee and lunch and want to try a new place... This. Is. The. Place!"}
{"text":"So amazed by this private business. Had a rolo iced with almond milk and hands down best coffee ever. Wish I didn't live so far!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great, but we always end there around lunch. My kids get sandwiches and cookies and the last time I had their southwestern egg wrap with egg whites. Yum yum!! I love living up in this area and love having a small mom and pop place to go to."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for the Sonoran Wrap. It is ALWAYS really good - tasty and plentiful. Atmosphere cozy and staff are always friendly. No complaints....and oh yeah...the regular coffee is very smooth. Love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while waiting to get tires rotated and had a salad. They offer a pretty much build-your-own salad, half and whole portions. Ingredients were fresh and Caesar dressing yummy (nothing worse that tired produce in a salad). Friendly service for sure. I'd come back."}
{"text":"My previous review was for daisy mtn coffee on carefree hwy and I-17. I don't know why it's now under Krazy 4 coffee. But I'll try Krazy today."}
{"text":"So, just a quick update, as I have been in several times now, with various friends... The opinion is universal, everyone has LOVED their food in here - and the coffee is great too. Very friendly people to boot. Nice, cosy atmosphere if you want to hang out and have a conversation over your coffee / meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped back in to pickup some coffee beans. Believe they were their \"5 star blend\". DELICIOUS !!!! Great dark roast beans, comparable price to everywhere else, but made locally! Now if it would just cool off a bit more will try stopping in for hot coffee, and have yet to make it for lunch. Hopefully someday soon!"}
