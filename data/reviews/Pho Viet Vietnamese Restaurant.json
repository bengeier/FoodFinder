{"text":"By far the best place for phó, they are always so inviting and friendly And everything is always fresh! You must order coffee it's worth the wait ;)"}
{"text":"Went to this place once! They just open and I had a bad service. The server did not remember 2 order of mine and when he brought my bowl of Pho he messed it up. He did ask me if I ever had Vietnamese food before ( i was insulted when he said that). Well I am ASIAN and i had plenty of Vietnamese food. Especially when I use to live around Westminster and garden grove. The Pho was okay I would recommend to reduce the amount of cinnamon put in the broth."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food. Today, I come with my bf who didnt like Vietnamese food, but he is crazy on it now!! (Thanks!!!!) 
Really love the Pho, and rice dishes. I'm gonna visit again soon. :D"}
{"text":"I had some wonton soup which is one of my favorite meal but the stuffing did not have shrimp inside of the wontons and the broth was good but I wonder if they put some MSG in the soup."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in Arizona for Vietnamese food! As a normal resident of northern California, I've eaten at my fair share of Vietnamese Restaurants around the bay and this place is definitely comparable! It seems like a locally owned family restaurant because I normally see the same servers there whenever I go. They actually even speak Vietnamese so you know you're probably going to eat somewhere a little bit more authentic.

Their pho and broth is delicious, but I usually get a vermicelli noodle dish, #98, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. I still don't know how to pronounce it properly, but I know how to eat it! It's basically the rice noodles with some vegetables, grilled pork, and an egg roll on top. They give you a small bowl of fish sauce (or patis to my fellow Pilipinos) and I usually just dump the whole bowl on top. Mix it all together and prepare for a savory meal!

It's located in the back corner of a strip mall area by a small hardware store and has public parking. They also have TVs in the corners and usually have some game playing."}
{"text":"Been there 5 or 6 times. Food is very good, place is always clean, and staff is friendly. Just a nice little family owned restaurant. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant. Only had Pho a couple of times, this was by far the best.
- Great portions, decadent flavoring, affordable prices, euphoric/speedy customer service and a modern/pleasant atmosphere.
I will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try a new place for some Pho & came across Pho Viet. We'll give it stars ONLY for the friendliness of staff & the place looked clean. The buck stops there! eeeYUK! on the food! Guess most reviewers have never had authentic Pho. 
I can't eat pork, it causes me stomach problems, so I ordered the Pho with beef. Not sure what the \"meat\" was, but it never moo'd in it's life. Or maybe it's a 'beef' mixed in with something. 
Broth was weak & not sure what they make it from. Even mixing in several things didn't make it palatable. Mu husband is one that will eat about anything, & even he said the food was bad. (Guess spending 20 years in Asia, you develop a taste for the 'real stuff'.)
I'm wondering if the'beef' in my Pho, was canned spam. I only ate about a 1/4th of it, wouldn't have eaten that much if I hadn't gone all day without eating. About 10 mins after we left, my stomach started to bloat. (My 1st clue it must've had pork in it.) Hey Dude! That aint kosher to do!
By the time we got home, not only the bloat, but cramping, & an urge to vomit.
Guess I get to spend the evening in the bathroom now!"}
{"text":"Wow.  We tried the chicken and the meatball pho.  Both were amazing. The spring roll looked totally weird on the plate but I convinced myself to try it and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was not great but we would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Pretty much my first review got twisted but this was a good place if you like good FOOD, then you'll try this place out."}
{"text":"In Short: Exceptional, Charming, Friendly, Authentic, Affordable, Highly Recommended.

My experience at Pho Viet was unprecedented and absolutely superb. I am from San Francisco and we pride ourselves on our exceptional standard for authentic asian cuisines, particularly vietnamese. I sauntered into Pho Viet expecting to be disappointed but was almost instantly impressed. 

The aesthetic  is open and understated and the space is brilliantly clean a clear. Everybody in the restaurant seemed really excited to be there which brought an uplifting and spirited bounce to the atmosphere. Pho Viet is a family owned restaurant and the owner (Peter) really makes an effort to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. He is inspiringly passionate about serving the communities around Phoenix authentic vietnamese food and, as a first time guest from out of town, I instantly felt like a guest in his home.

I started my dining experience with an ice cold glass of vietnamese coffee at the bar. The coffee was brewed right in front of me and smelled sweet and delicious. It was poured over ice and drank smooth as silk, bringing on that charming coffee buzz.

For appetizers I had the grilled pork spring rolls. I will order these EVERY time I come here. The vegetables were crisp and fresh and the pork was exquisitely grilled to perfection with a touch of sweetness. They come with a rather zesty dipping sauce, which is delicious, however, I recommend trying them with the restaurants very own chili sauce, which helps accentuate the flavors while simultaneously adding a bit of kick.

The owner (Peter) recommended I try the Pho Dac Biet for my main course (the staff here are always more than happy to help you find something to your liking if you are inexperienced ordering Vietnamese food). I ended up going with Peter's recommendation and it did not disappoint. The Pho comes out gloriously steaming in a large porcelain bowl and is set down in front of you as if it is a gift offering before a king. Fresh sprouts and spices are brought out on a separate plate so you can customize the soup to your liking. The soup broth was fresh and flavorful and yet still had that clean simplified essence that you hope for in vietnamese food. The rice noodles were some of the best I've ever had and beef was just the right amount of tender. Really, I couldn't imagine a better bowl of Pho.

One of the greatest things about the whole experience was how cheap it all was. When the bill came out at the end of the meal, I couldn't believe how little I was being asked to pay for such exceptional food! Next time I'm back in Phoenix this is the first place I'll go.

Great food! Great service! Great Price!"}
{"text":"First time and last time dinning in here.
My husband ordered Bo Kho and the beef was terrible. It was completely inedible and hard, all hard tissue and no tender meat. What a deception. I ordered 124 Pho Hai San and was fishing for the tiny pieces of seafood in the broth and rice noodels."}
{"text":"Love the foods and the service is great.  Absolutely will come back and bring friends :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BOBA drinks in the valley... Wide variety of flavors and they will CUSTOMIZE to your liking!

....oh and the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Pho and thai tea was amazing.  I love the family atmosphere"}
{"text":"My honey and I eat at Pho Viet every week & are always very satisfied with the quality of the food as well as the portion size. 
We have our favorites.  He tries different dishes all the time,  where my fav is the \"birds nest\" (my nickname for the crispy noodles)with all those yummy veggies, great broth & tofu. 
I am vegetarian so I am limited to some choices but most dishes that are made with meat can also be made with tofu. Just ask. 
And Mr. Peter is a walking menu & has memorized every item which is amazing since there are probably 100 or more different choices. 
Maggie, Pete's sis is adorable.  
Mom & Dad very cool as well! 
Great food.  Great value.  
Give them a try & you will be happy you did! 
Oh yeah...try the Vietnamese coffee. YUM!"}
{"text":"I actually came across this restaurant from via my mother who brought me soup from here after surgery in 2013. It was awesome! There was nothing like this pho that would clean you out and get you feeling back up to par when under the weather. We recommended it to friends and family and would drive long distances just for some of this awesomeness. 

Unfortunately, this past year, this place is sub par for both the pho and spring rolls (our favorites). It's not so bad that we will stop going all together, but the quality has slipped enough to that we now go out of our way to go elsewhere. 

Compared to a year ago, their spring rolls are stingy and smaller with less sauce and roll-filling given. They used to be bursting at the seems with the fresh crunch when you bite in to it and fresh peanut sauce to dip in. Now, the rolls are significantly smaller and missing the fresh factor for both the roll and sauce. 

Review of our most recent visits resulting in this rating: 
Of our last five visits, four have been takeouts. 
Three of the takeouts have been missing components (that we ordered and were charged extra for) but were not in the containers when we got home. They tie-knot the takeout bags, which is perfectly fine, but it prevented us from just flip the lid and and making sure the order was complete and correct before we left.Plus, each time, we figured the issues were individual, fluke incidents because of the quality we used to experience. 

The fourth takeout, the only issue was with the amount of food. You used to get a whole heck of a lot more food and at least get a full feeling an order of soup. This time, the typical to-go tray was less than half way full, and the broth cup was about half full of broth, instead of at the bottom of the lip of the container. We actually undid this bag before taking it home, so none of it had spilled or anything. This is just what was provided to us. There seems to be no quality-control for what leaves the kitchen anymore.

The one order we sat in for was extremely stingy on the broth. Make sure you ask for noodles on the side if you order to eat in the restaurant. We could not even mix in any of the vegetables because there was no room to to stir around the noodles. It was an issue with not being enough broth and about twice the amount of noodles you'd get on a typical to-go order. (Typical referring to what you'd get in 2013). 

The staff is kind, smiling, and accommodating. The only change i've seen over the past year is that the owner used to be more involved and present. Now, he's usually in the back on the phone. We also used to order the same soup every time for my mother as a sort of custom order, and it was never really an issue until the customization was no longer an option. It's fine if you don't want to customize for a customer, but don't send them home with an entree when they ordered a soup. 

All in all, things are going down hill more and more (enough for me to actually write a review). It's not a bad establishment. But, it's definitely no longer a 4.5-5 star place like it was originally. Just please be aware that for what is charged, neither the quality or quantity is present,"}
{"text":"My whole family loves coming to Pho Viet to eat. Friendly and clean atmosphere. Best Pho Ga!!!! Very nice and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"The website should be \"www.thebomb.com\"  Best place in the valley! Not only is the food fantastic, it's cheap and the people are amazing! Vegetarian to a meat eating brood mixed with a shellshocking seafood addict would never run out of options! I have been here a couple dozen times and keep coming back for more. Have yet to be served anything that I didn't absolutely love."}
{"text":"Always always ALWAYS come here when we're craving soup! My husband and I come AT LEAST once every two weeks. We moved to Phoenix a year ago and I could not find a great pho place like back home in San Diego and thought I never would but this place definitely proved me wrong. Never disappoints, no matter what we order. Staff is always friendly and welcoming, and the owner is so awesome. Thank you Pho Viet!"}
{"text":"The pho was good! It was my first time having pho and it had a strong clove flavor(a spice) i don't particularly like clove so it was hard for me to love the pho.  I don't know know if it taste like that everywhere but i will ask next time i decide to have it somewhere else.  If it wasn't for that particular taste i would have loved it ."}
{"text":"I ate at Pho Viet this afternoon and was favorably impressed. I ordered two different Spring Rolls and both were good. I tried a new one for me, the Goi Chon Nem Nuong which is with grilled sliced pork patty(Vietnamese Spam), I liked it. Then I ordered a grilled pork spring roll with shrimp for a dollar more which was delicious and fat. I finished with a grilled pork Banh Mi, bread was both crispy and chewy with ample fillings. All in all a good meal. I deducted a point as you can get grilled pork spring rolls with the shrimp included without the dollar upcharge at many other Vietnamese Restaurants. I also like more of a mint, herb presence in the spring rolls. I would like to see a \"Roll Your Own\" option as well. 

Friendly staff and prompt service. I especially like their Facebook page as well as their website.

Restaurant was  very clean and inviting.

I look forward to trying many of their other offerings."}
{"text":"We first started coming here because we had just moved here from California, and it was the closest pho restaurant around. I'm very picky when it comes to pho, primarily due to growing up in cities where Asians seem to be the majority of the population, and where pho restaurants are everywhere, but this place is pretty good, compared to the other places we've tried here in the northern Phoenix area.

The restaurant is very clean and has a pretty calming ambiance. It's more Americanized than most pho restaurants that I've been to. ALL of the servers here are very nice, which, is a big plus for us. We also always order either spring rolls or eggrolls to start, which always come out fast. I almost always get pho here and my sister always changes her plates from pho, bun thit nuong, or some other soup. Sometimes I'll get the coffee/mocha slushy thing and it IS delicious! 

Overall, I think we mainly come here because it is such a cool place. I think the food is decent, but it's the environment, the awesome servers, and the slow Vietnamese music or 80's pop, that gets us to come back. You can have a fast meal and still sit and HANG OUT, which isn't typically the norm for a pho place."}
{"text":"I walked in and asked an older gentleman if they could make me some chicken and vegetables since I'm on a special diet.  Also added that if it could have some flavor, I would appreciate.  They brought out a delicious chicken and vegetables stir fry that was plenty flavorful, and looked appetizing.  Not very often that you find restaurants eager to accommodate for a special diet without an additional cost, so I was grateful to find this place.  I would have rather tasted their Pho, but alas, my old wardrobe beckons.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Great spot. Clean restaurant with a good staff. Have yet to order something that I haven't liked. Veggies have always tasted fresh. This place has been my number one go to since moving to this side of town."}
{"text":"I love this pho place. The broth is 9 out of 10 times perfect...not too oily and flavorful. Their egg rolls are also awesome. I also tried one the crepe appetizers...that was a bit oily but yummy."}
{"text":"I had the best pho dac biet in recent memory here last evening. and the cutest waitstaff anywhere to boot.
definitely a keeper, will be back, fo' sho"}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhh-mazing and I'm not pho-king with you ! :) I'm so happy I found this place! I had visited a pho place down the street called Angelina's but dang their service was terrible. On top of that, their food took foreverrrrrrrr to get. i just want some soup, dang it! BUT now my problems are solved! not only are the staff incredible and super helpful, especially Peter but the food is out of this world ! The service is also quick and they are on top of it! He explained all the cuisines to me and answered any question I had! this place will see me again and again! the spring rolls are super refreshing ! i usually get the number 14 with the rare beef and meatballs. yum! they have that combo for $10 which is a steal! I've also tried their #50! delicious broth! and I have gotten a com Dac Biet. peter had said it had a little bit of all their grilled selections .. uhhhh DELICIOUS! The bobas? Try itttttt. Peter said coconut and jackfruit? super super tasty. the coffee? you'll never be able to go back to Starbucks! People of Glendale! Check out Pho Viet! You won't regret it !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The pho was delicious, spring rolls, and egg rolls. The waitress was friendly had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The owners and waiters/waitress are very friendly! Of the many times my family has gone there, their recommendations are always good. 

My favorite are any of the pho dishes as well as fried rice, but honestly everything i have eaten and drunken is amazing.  If you are looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant this is the place to go for inexpensive, very good food."}
{"text":"I crave this place weekly. I'm all about the pho thai and fried rice. I'm not a pho expert, but everyone needs to try this. I did go once with a big group on a friday night and the service was slow, just a heads up."}
{"text":"Where do I start????

      I had a Daddy Daughter lunch date with my 9 month old and I was craving some good Vietnamese. It's a little hard to find its in a plaza tucked in on the end. 
      I was greeted immediately by a nice man and he found a nice table where I could park my stroller on the end. 

      This place is spotless! I was thrilled that usually means the kitchen is clean too. So I ordered the lunch special a regular sized bowl beef and meatball noodle soup with an egg roll and a Pepsi for 10.00 bucks. I was feeling like a fatty so ordered the butter garlic crispy chicken wings as an appetizer. 

       I finished it all!!! it was hot , fresh and Flavor bomb central. The staff was so attentive and friendly.....I was recently introduced to Vietnamese coffee with sweetened condensed milk so I ordered some and it was a great way to finish the meal. 

Definitely a great lunch spot and date spot too. I'm afraid that this place is going to be found by all lovers of Vietnamese and no longer be a Hidden Gem.....go you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phoenix! Food is fantastic and priced well. My favorite is seafood pho, shrimp spring rolls and a fresh coconut to drink! My husband swears by the oxtail pho and rolls with ham. Atmosphere is family friendly and casual. We've gone here at least once a week for the past year. A must try!"}
{"text":"We went to this place and everything looks great from the paintings to the picture frames a place really peaceful,clean and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"About to try Vietnamese food for the first time! The place looks clean, (1 star) I see some good reviews about this place(2 stars), the people here are nice, (3 stars) we'll see if they earn the other 2 stars."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place to everyone looking for amazing vietnamese food, great service, warm atmosphere, and clean environment!  Plenty of choices and the owner and staff are waiting to serve you in any way possible!!! Will definitely eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected to get from a Vietnamese restaurant. Have been to several in the valley and this was not up to standards we expect from this country's cuisine. 
Grilled pork tasted like fried pork bellies, which is fine if we ordered that...
The soup was not served cooking hot (hot enough to cook the rare meat served in the dish)
Sorry but not going to recommend with so many other delicious options in Phoenix within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood, family owned restaurant. The Pho broth is  well flavored and delicious delicious with a lot of different meat options. The griller pork banh mi is also a great option."}
{"text":"This place is fresher than a mother pho ga!!! Everything here is great! We had the pho, cold vermicelli noodles, cube beef, and boba smoothies for dessert. Everything was perfect, service was great, friendly staff, got awesome shirts too!!! We're from Tucson, but we would happily drive back here just to eat pho. Would seriously recommend."}
{"text":"Love the food.  The service this last time was really slow.  Slow to get drinks, order, very slow to receive food.  Even slow to get our check paid.  I hope it was just that a server called in sick or something.  two servers in a popular restaurant doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch and was very impressed. The service was prompt and the food was great!!! The vegetarian spring rolls were delicious and the pho ga was perfect!!!! It was wonderful food and service for an extremely reasonable price!!! What more could you ask for?!?!?!?!!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. First off we ate at 2:30 in the afternoon. Obviously family run our male server in his early 20s was quick, friendly and helpful with the menu. I consider myself an advanced consumer of Vietnamese fare but I found the choices here extensive. We ordered our usual test meal of Shrimp Spring Rolls and Rice Vermicelli with pork and egg roll. I found the Spring Rolls to be large and excellent. With 3 shrimp and a generous slice of pork every bite was delicious. The peanut sauce was fine. Our main course was very good. Vermicelli was not over cooked, the pork tasted like it came off a grill. The cucumber,sprouts, lettuce and cilantro were all very fresh. They were also kind enough to bring a sample of their Pho broth. It was also very good although i prefer a bit more spice. To be fair, the sample did not come with the full compliment of garnishes.  My only complaint was I am used to a little more flavor in the vinegar sauce for the vermicelli as well as the Pho. Still, the best Vietnamese fare I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"So here it is. I've been living in this island called Glendale surrounded by the ocean that is Phoenix. when it comes to good \"ethnic\" foods, you have \"Chinese\" or Indian to really choose from. Yes there are quasi-mexican restaurants to choose from, but growing up in San Diego almost my entire life, it kinda gets old. I'd say about...what...4 years ago I was introduced to Pho, and my life was never the same. Well priced, amazing in hot or cold weather, start off with a tasty broth and add a whole bunch of sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeños, hoisin, and some blisteringly hot sriracha sauce. It only took me a couple months after discovering it to find out what i like and dislike, and finding that one Pho spot where I would keep going to eat at. After moving to phoenix 11 months ago, I set out on a mission to find the perfect pho, there's one shop right next to Fry's, but it's tiny and the food isn't really anything all that impressive. There's the other one down a ways west on bell and 59th? I went there once and was mildly depressed after eating. A few weeks went by and while i was out getting a haircut, i saw a \"Coming Soon\" sign for a brand new Pho place. almost everyday i would swing by to see if it was open. And AT LONG LAST i stopped by today to check it out, with a glowing neon \"OPEN\" sign i poked my head in to see what was on the up-and-up. I was seated instantly, given a menu to peruse, and an ice cold glass of water. i already knew what i wanted, my standard Pho Tai Chin, can never go wrong with that, and also an order of their Cha Gio egg rolls, completely superb. the service was incredibly friendly and helpful, the place was extremely clean and well lit. I'm making it a goal to eat here 2+ times a week. and i'm recommending it to everyone i know. thanks for being great guys and good luck in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place my friend turned me onto.  Being from San Diego, I am spoiled with the best Pho places.  This is a great place for Pho.  I really liked the grilled pork spring rolls- so flavorful and yummy!  I definitely recommend you give this place a try.  Service is great.
Very cute and cheeky T shirts too ."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My family and I have been eating here since the day they opened and it is by far our favorite restaurant. We eat here at least once a week and it's outstanding every time.  I alternate between several pho's (shrimp, brisket, and veggie).  All have a rich flavorful broth that is not greasy with healthy portions of meat.  My hubby always gets the chicken pho which is also excellent.   If you're up for Bun, the grilled shrimp bun phenomenal.   Sometimes I order the grilled shrimp by itself, it's so good.  Besides the food being outstanding,  the family that owns it (and their staff) are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  They treat us, and everyone else, like family.   Awesome food, awesome people."}
{"text":"Great new dinner spot on \"our\" side of town! My husband loves pho and was looking for a spot to take me for me to try. I'm so glad it was to Pho Viet. Everything was delicious and I'm a now a convert myself!

We had both the fresh spring rolls as well the egg rolls to start, both we're excellant. Dinner-wise we had to have the pho; he got the beef flank with meatballs and I got the chicken (I went safe for my first time). Yum! Yum! Yum! I also had the Thai tea with boba which was also very tasty.

Everyone at the restaurant was extremely friendly and helpful! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back. Many thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. This shrimp fried rice is addicting and the soup is phenomenal. Me and my husband have decided to make it our new Vietnamese restaurant. Why not check out next door to for a great massage. We did both!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Pho I have had in this state. Family owned and operated. Friendly atmosphere, nice people."}
{"text":"I love this place, only getting four starts because in a couple of occasions I have had my order messed up. They over cooked my fried egg on more than one occasion, but even then the food was still amazing. I would recommend the Ox tail really good!"}
{"text":"This place was basically like buying a Lexus on Craigslist and being disappointed that the engine is a Kia Rio. High ratings on Yelp lured me to choose this place over many other places that I know have notably not disappointed regardless of their Yelp reviews. This is my second time eating here despite being disappointed the first time (gave it a second try and thought time would improve the food/experience). I have eaten at many different pho places in the valley (Pho Chandler, Angelina's Pho, Pho Avina, Pholicious, Pho Thanh (both locations), Little Saigon, Pho Binh, 43rd Express, Da vang, unPhogettable , Khai Hoan)
and this by far ranks last on my list. Pho is priced much higher with less food than the competitors, it was also more oily than most and one the people in my party ordered pork chop and rice (which they forgot and rushed to us that ended up being raw, I saw it and it was basically still oinking and we all eat rare steak so this was unreal)."}
{"text":"I don't know how they get the 4 stars. The food is only ok, too salty & too much MSG. However the service is decent and the place is clean comparing to some of the Asian restaurants. My suggestion is if you are allergic to MSG, be aware!!!"}
{"text":"Love the pho soup it comes with plenty of fresh veggies! Staff is quick and attentive- service has been great with both dine-in and take-out."}
{"text":"The best in the area! Nice staff, too. Pho is amazing."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many other pho restaurants so I have little to compare to.  With that being said, I really do enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner.  I usually get the Pho Thai (#13- rice noodle soup with rare steak) and it always hits the spot.  They serve lots of fresh ingredients to throw into the soup (basil, mint, bean sprouts, jalapenos, greens) and have a good selection of sauces to compliment the dish. If you order the pho special, it comes with a drink and an egg roll or spring roll for $10.  I am not usually an egg roll fan, but always order them here because I really like how crispy they come out.  The place is clean and the staff is usually pretty friendly.  Funny t-shirts with great puns if you want a souvenir as well."}
{"text":"We stopped by the restaurant after a recommendation from a friend. The food exceeded all expectations. If you are in town for a visit I would highly recommend Pho Viet. The staff was very helpful in suggesting menu items and the restaurant was extremely clean. We even bought one of the shirts. If we ever return to Glendale then we will most definitely be paying Pho Viet a visit again."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I very much enjoy the food every time.  I usually get my food to go, but the portion sizes are great!  The Pho is seasoned perfectly and seems very authentic.  The sandwiches are some of the best every.  LOVE the spiciness of some of the dishes.  It can be hard to choose what to order because there are sooooo many options, but I have not had a bad dish yet."}
{"text":"This was my first time, took my brother at his request for his birthday. Order was delivered and added condiments to my soup and started eating. After first bite I noticed a young server leaning over the counter facing us picking his nose.  After he was enjoying his nose excrements I yelled out to him asking him if he would stop picking his nose! The other servers and he chuckled! I could not take another bite! Went to get our check and told the fellow at the register of the occurrence. He then gave me the bill, still charged us for the meal. I paid and we left. I can't imagine what goes on in the kitchen if this type of behavior happens out in front of the house. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"You must try the rare beef Pho.  I've tried Pho at other restaurant but I keep coming back to Pho Viet.  Myself and my co-work eat there at least two times a week.  I highly recommend the #13 Pho with rare beef.  The meat is very tender and never fatty.  The broth is packed with flavor and the noodles are cooked to perfection. 

The staff is very friendly and they pride themselves on running a clean, efficient restaurant."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, everybody works together and works hard, everyone is outgoing and the place overall is a great atmosphere! And most importantly, the food is amazing! I wish I could give this place one hundred stars!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. We sat there unattended for 15 minutes. Our table was in the middle of the room so we were not out of sight at all. Nobody checked on us or even given us the menu. What a waste of time. We left without getting served not even water. Will not be coming here. Also the location is a little sketchy. Won't be wandering around here at night."}
{"text":"Pho Viet has quickly become one of my favorite spots to eat at. I love their pho the most, but their bahn mi is great too. Their mocha and taro boba are the best options in my opinion. Their service is also excellent. They have some of the most friendly servers in the business."}
{"text":"I finally found a good Vietnamese place.. as seen by my other reviews, I've been looking and looking for good pho and just all around good Vietnamese. And this place is pretty damn good. I order the shrimp and pork rice rolls as well as the pho with the pork meatballs? I guess you can call them lol... whatever they were they were so good. Everything had great flavor. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here almost once a week they know us by name!! Great service and very clean restaurant the food speaks for itself very yummy and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. This is my favorite restaurant and I look forward to going whenever we get a chance. 

The food is great. We started going here when I first discovered Pho and we found this place. They serve vegetarian Pho and it is so good. They put tons of veggies in their soup and helps it to be more filling than a lot of other Pho restaurants. 

Sadly, the services is not 5 star. It is hit or miss, sometimes they are very attentive and others it is hard to get there attention to get a water refill. Honestly, if their food continues to be as awesome as it has so far I can overlook the service. I go for the food experience not for the service.

So far we have tried several rice dishes and we love them all but the combination rice is our favorite. My husband always gets the beef Pho and I get the vegetarian. Both very good. We have also tried several noodle dishes. My daughter loves the Mi Xao Mem Chay (#48). I have had the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich a few times and that is insane good. The last time we went we tried the Vietnamese coffee. I drank that down and could have had a few more if I wasn't so full from all the food.

I highly recommend this place it is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pho is our comfort food, and we have tried several local Vietnamese restaurants--none come close to Pho Viet. The service is always great and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Very solid but only very solid. We tried the bun, the pho, Spring rolls, eggrolls and a bánh mì. Super friendly staff in a busy environment."}
{"text":"Keeping it short and sweet I would definitely recommend coming here, I get a very authentic vibe from this place and it's very clean. On a thursday night I went with my girlfriend and every seat was taken. Our server was very quick to take our order, but unfortunately it took a while before everything came and when it did, the 2.25$ additional price I paid for additional shrimp only netted me 3 more shrimp. 3 shrimp for 2.25$ left a very sour taste in my mouth as obviously that's extraordinarily cheap, but everything else was very good and I was happy with the amount I got. The bill came out to about 25$ without tip and the food was very tasty, but the very small amount of shrimp I got definitely made this place lose a star, I still can't believe that they would honestly think that's a reasonable price for such a small amount of shrimp. I can get a bag of 50 at least for around 8-10$ really unfortunate. 

If you're in the mood for pho and have 30-50 minutes to kill, I would definitely recommend checking this place out, just don't ask for additional shrimp, you'll be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pho Viet is by far the best Pho restaurant I have ever been to. I ordered the #12 Pho with everything.  I also ordered the Fried Rice with chicken and beef.  I wanted to order a little of everything on the menu because each plate was so amazing I could only imagine how everything else must taste.  

The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was extremely friendly. Especially the owners and their son Peter. I'm not one to usually write reviews but I just had to tell everyone how amazing this place is. It was as if I was dining on the food of the gods... that's how good it was.   I live an hour from Pho Viet and I will gladly make this drive more often to dine in this heavenly place."}
{"text":"I have a few favorite go to pho spots, but i decided to try this because it was the closest to me. That being said i'm glad i did. I loved that you could really taste the clove in the pho, some places have started to get bland with their flavoring but this was on point. The egg rolls were as good as the ones from my favorite spot too. Our waitress was really cool and my son asked if we could start coming to this one so enough said. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was because i'm use to the cheaper prices at my spot and bigger bowls but don't let that stop you from coming the FOOD IS GREAT and worth it! we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can only hope (in assuming) these reviews are NOT about the Pho. 

I believe in second chances. I've tried this place x2 and the outcome was the same... Left hungry because I didn't finish the disappointing food. 

Tried and failed:
Pho (meatball/tripe/tendon)
Pho (brisket)
Wings (in fish sauce)
Spring roll 

Do yourself a favor and just go to Angelina's Pho&Grill.."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. I eat the Pho here a couple times a week. The broth has the best flavor out of all the places in town"}
{"text":"The Pho was excellent and my husbands fried rice was great. The service was a little slow with the water but we will be back"}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times in the past 3 weeks. The food is spectacular and the service is wonderful. Peter recommends a dish and every time is better than the last. The coffee is so good that I dream about it. I recommend this to everyone!!! :-)"}
{"text":"This is a great, family run business with yummy pho! You should definitely try them out! Spring rolls and phone dac biet are d'lish!!"}
{"text":"A cure for the first time. The people are very pleasant, helpful, and very courteous. The food was absolutely delicious. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be a return customer! I had a chicken noodle bowl that was amazing! They give you plenty, it's clean, very friendly and priced great! I'm so impressed. The owner is so sweet. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Ordered combo fried rice, egg rolls, Pho with meatballs and steak and a smoothie for dessert.  My group all thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal and the entire staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is very clean, and fast.  They are consistent with the food (flavor) in general.  There's a lot to choose from but I usually get the pho.  You can get a regular bowl (which is gigantic) or a large bowl (which is ridiculously large) for a dollar more.  Sometimes the pho is a little too salty.  Their Iced cream tea is great and not too sweet.  Their iced Vietnamese-style drip coffee with sweetened-condensed milk tastes good but you don't get a lot (seems like maybe two tablespoons) for the money.  But those are minor gripes; overall a great experience.  It's in a good area as well."}
{"text":"I live right near this place and I watched as it got ready to open. I love Vietnamese food so I was pretty anxious to try it. I was not disappointed. The staff was very friendly. The food was fresh and delicious. The place was kept very clean. 

There are a couple of other Vietnamese restaurants in the immediate area but they are nowhere near as good as this one."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and though it was 110d degrees outside a bowl of pho sounded delicious so I searched for a Vietnamese restaurant and came across this one and am I glad I did! I ended up getting the bun bo hue which was the best. I know it inauthentic but I love the fact it didn't come with blood cake just a really spicy delicious broth with tendon, pig knuckle and beef (?) I can't remember the their meat but it was all good. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First visit: staff very loud  in communicating with each other. Food was good but dry had to use soup to try to bring some moisture to rice , chicken and egg rolls. May give it another try"}
{"text":"Sooo close to 4 or more stars, you just muffed it a bit.  Still A-OK. 

Golden Moments On a Rainy Day:

  The friendly, efficient greet and seat, by the owner, on a cool afternoon.
Sunny, aptly fragrant, jasmine tea in a cup.
Crunchy, yellow, savory, Saigon crepe on a plate, with ethereal herbs snuggled up alongside.
  The east-facing view from booth three, with the greenery at the back of the lot, muted by mist, then further obscured by moderate showers.

Some Rain On The Parade:

   No knife to cut the crepe. No Big, but with many thousands of these served, I was left to wonder if proper protocol was to MacGyver a scissors out of the chopsticks, somehow. Or do people use the hard edge of the awkward Asian spoon I can never quite get my lips around comfortably? I'd really like to avoid slurping, (yeah, yeah, there's tradition, I know) but don't need to since I ordered no soup. I got up and asked for a knife. Maybe, in future, will carry own spoon, although that sounds a little bit weird. Sweet Confucius, I'm conflicted again.
  The nuoc mam, while tasty, and clearly lighter than the fish sauce offered in the condiment caddy at the table, failed to contain any flavor of lime, as advertised, fresh or otherwise. I can't understand why.

Crispy Butter Garlic Wings:
   Truly crisp and delicious, BUT, with no butter or garlic present. At All. Whatsoever. How Lame.
   Being loath to return food to virtually ANY kitchen, since, too often, sins of retribution are committed there. I was ready to pay, and so, asked for a box.
   Placing the wings on a small bed of herbs left from the crepe dish, I doused them with the remaining fish sauce, as well. After second-guessing that decision for a while, I laughed to find Wings With Fish Sauce as the actual, next menu choice.
   Super surprised, but seriously happy with how the mint managed to infuse it's flavor into the bird in an hour. Small thanks to Pho Viet for serving the plain, undressed wings. I should get a chef's credit for this one, just sayin'.

   Jeers to the software at ANY place that calculates a 15 to 30% tip from your bill, then prints the \"less than subtle reminder\" on the receipt. Yeah, I've seen it before. I totally get it, and I know some of you think it's a service. It is, but it's not \"customer\" service. It's the electronic equiv' of having the staff lined up at the door, all superficial smiles, palms extended.
   So many negative words I could use for this practice. I'll just say it's annoying.
And so thoughtless, to leave as the parting memory of a place.

   With the above quibbles now off my chest, I can unequivocally claim, I will return  without qualms."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was amazing and the waiters are extremely nice and quick. I had a hard time deciding what to get on the menu since everything looked so good. I ended up getting pho, of course. It tasted just like my mom's pho."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to Vietnamese food, it's almost authentic! 
Love their spring shrimp rolls, portions are fantastic and service on point. 
Love their Thai iced tea, trying one of them blended drink with jelly beans is refreshing my favorite coconut with cappuccino, I alway anticipate to come back to enjoy food over and over, love to bring my family and friends here when they come from out of town. 
Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dat pho tho! 
Delicious authentic Pho my favorite #13
The owner is probably one of the best looking Vietnamese boys I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"Diverse menu, happy staff, colorful ambience. Will return again! Pho tai is excellent with great broth flavor."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because it has high ratings. My hu tieu dac biet was just okay. I came here with 3 other people and everyone else thought the food sub par as well.  

They give a lot of noodles which is a plus, but the soup was tasted heavily of msg and they skimp on the meats and veggies.

There were not a lot of people there (probably cause it was 2pm). We got seated quickly and service was good. Overall it was an okay experience, but I think I prefer the Vietnamese restaurant inside Lee Lee Asian supermarket!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time here and the food is always good. Love this place! Turn Down Pho What?"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 1 stars because I found a long black hair in our second order of spring rolls. The lady did NOT even apologize she just took the order from us. NOT coming back."}
{"text":"Decent food ok service. Gave it a try as I was hoping to find great pho closer to home but pho 43 is better and worth the drive. Back to this place the Thai tea was sweet and the Boba was chewy but not perfect. The pho and spring noodles were decent shrimp were not deveined very well. They were having issues with cards and were only taking cash. Meh"}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I had!!! Delicious! The staff is super friendly. Amazing coffee as well!"}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley. As soon you walk in you are greeted with a smile by the by the family owned and operated staff. Flavor, portions, and price are phenomenal. Highly recommend going to Pho Viet for all your Pho cravings!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and can't stop going. Would go everyday if I could. Love the people make us feel like we are family."}
{"text":"Recently ate at Pho Viet. The restaurant is very clean and the food is very good. During our visit we ordered the 5 count egg rolls as an appetizer. One of the female servers brought our egg rolls and walked away. Shortly after a different female server brought another plate of two egg rolls to our table. My friend and I were confused but thought maybe the additional egg rolls came with our pho entrees. The first server came back to our table and said that we were only supposed to receive 5 egg rolls. I had said jokingly that she could have them back. The server walked away and returned a minute or two later. She set a plate down in front of me and asked me to take two of the egg rolls and place them on the plate. I picked up two egg rolls, placed them on the plate and the server took them back into the kitchen. I am not sure if she threw away the egg rolls or served them to another customer but it was very odd."}
{"text":"I love this pho place. The broth is 9 out of 10 times perfect...not too oily and flavorful. Their egg rolls are also awesome. I also tried one the crepe appetizers...that was a bit oily but yummy."}
{"text":"The Pho and spring rolls are my favorite. I stumbled on this place as it's close to my home, and really like it. Nice open atmosphere, friendly service."}
{"text":"Went on a Pho kick when I was sick, and this place did the trick. Will come back in the future. The beef Pho is especially delicious."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but I question their preparation process.  I pulled out a sizable plastic wrap from my mouth after took a bite of their Vietnamese sandwich.  While most of the meat quality are within standard, their flank meat had some weird smell and we suspect it was probably sitting out in the room temperature for too long."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Everyone who works here is so nice and the pho and egg rolls are fantastic. My go to pho place."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and super fast service. Food was fresh and taste was just as good. I would recommend to anyone in the area. I brought family here to try Pho for the first time and they loved it!!!  Place was pretty busy so I'm guessing everyone loves it here."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and got the rare beef Pho.  It was ok, but I'm partial to another place for my Vietnamese.  However, The service was excellent, the place was clean and I'd definitely be back to try something new."}
{"text":"We come here all the time not only because it is convenient but because the staff is friendly and the food is great! Since we have been here so many times, it's likely that not every time we will have a 100% perfect experience. There have been times that certain items have been missed or forgotten but they always to their best to accommodate and remedy the situation if it does happen. That to me deserves 5 stars. We really enjoy this place and recommend it to anyone who lives near by."}
{"text":"First and last visit.  Not enough protein, Pad Thai was too sweet and it cost almost $10. It arrived with six shrimp and peppers.  I asked for veggies. Very disappointing. Also ordered Pho with chicken & shrimp for $10.  Had 3 shrimp and chicken in a small bowl.  The windows and door need cleaning.  The intake vents are full of crust.  The restaurant is old and needs attention.  There are fans everywhere.  I assume it becomes very hot in the summer to eat at this place. This place could use a good inspection!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went there for their spicy beef soup. We were disappointed. The broth was bland. The temperature of the soup was cold. Their service was okay. It was not the best pho I had."}
{"text":"I first found out about this new vietnamese restaurant on the yelp app for \"hot new businesses\" and I wanted to try the place out after seeing the facebook pictures and reading other early yelp reviews. 

When I first walked in, immediately recognize that this wasn't your typical \"pho shop\" and enjoyed the modern decor for a change of view, the waiters greeted us with smiles and the owners were very nice! Everyone was helpful in every single way possible A+ for customer service; that alone will encourage me to want to repeat business. 

I had the springrolls and bo luc lac and both were very delicious - I only wish that they have a more like peanut buttery sauce for the springrolls but their sauce for it was good too! my mom had bun bo hue and she enjoyed that very much as well as talking to everyone there LOL


Though I haven't tried the pho yet, I'm itching to go back and try when I'm in the area for sure :)"}
{"text":"First time.  Great food.  Was impressed. Had pho, papaya salad, Thai tea. Spring rolls were meh"}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had! There were so many choices. The portions are very generous. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place,  friendly service, very clean.  Food was good I enjoyed it.   The sauces given were real good.  Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Great value for the price. Never a wait. To-go order are always ready on time and most importantly the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and fresh. Service was a little slow but it was also busy. We would return."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that my \"last meal\" if i was ever on death row would be Pho. I love the stuff. Now that i said that, I had the best bowl of Pho i have ever had in the united states here. Period. I had the bowl with everything in it, I believe it is the first option under the Pho menu there. Everything about the bowl was perfect. The broth, noodles, the exact perfect ratio of the flank, tripe etc. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming which is something i havent experienced a lot in places like this. I had at least 5 or 6 people walk up to me making sure i was taken care of. Absolutely everyone working there were all smiles. Now if that werent enough the prices are incredible. My bowl was HEARTY. I can put down some Pho, and the portion had me completely stuffed. And it was like 8 bucks. Incredible bang for your buck. 

I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody. Absolutely go out of your way to come here. I not only intend to be back, but i can see myself very easily being a regular here. Incredible food, incredible price, incredible staff. And they serve beer. 

10/10"}
{"text":"Tried many pho places in Orange County, riverside, and even San Diego. This is the best place I've tried. Their broth is soooo good and the chicken is fresh. Some places you can tell the chicken was cooked ahead of time. First time I went with family after a girls shopping day and they all loved it too. We tried the pho, spring rolls, and the omelette type dish that was filled with sprouts and shrimp that you wrap in lettuce leaves. No problem asking for extra veggies and the staff is very accommodating. The nephew of the owner came out to ask how everything was and even remembered me when I came bak with my husband and daughter. Staff is very nice and willing to accommodate to your requests. If they forget to bring you something just ask :)  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Phoenix so far. I have been to a number of other places but their food is not half as authentic and tasty as this one. Great assortment of dishes on offer. I had the grilled chicken and rice vermicelli bowl with lots of fresh bean sprouts, cucumbers, mint and wonderful fish sauce mix. Grilled chicken was super tasty and meaty...not fatty. Pho soups looked wonderful as well.  Service is friendly and fast. This is definitely my new go-to place for Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love this place!! We found it by accident when they were having their grand opening. It's one of my favorite places to stop for lunch on Friday after a busy week!

We always start with Goi Cuon, steamed shrimp, pork and vegetable spring rolls. They are wrapped in rice paper and served with peanut sauce. I could eat these all day!

There are many choices on the menu. The pho is very good and flavorful! One of our favorites is #59, Com Dac Biet. It has shrimp, pork, chicken, shrimp paste, Vietnamese meatloaf and a few other things. The food is fresh. Portion sizes are good. 

The service is excellent. Everyone remembers us from previous visits, and they always make us feel welcome.

Look and feel inside is clean and modern. 

Highly recommend! And while you're there, don't forget to try a tiger beer!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted to treat family to PHO.  This place came up as highly rated so we took the plunge.  Here's what we ordered:

Spring rolls (with rice paper):  These rolls lacked cilantro which usually is in it and imparts a great flavor.  Flavorless roll.  The peanut sauce which accompanied them was watered down.  Sorry we ordered 4 of them as that was a total waste. Rating=2

Chicken PHO:  Hubby asked for it spicy and all they did was drop in a reddish hot oil which floated to the top and made it greasy.  The chicken was BIG TIME overcooked with striations on the meat, an indicator of overcooking.  He said that if he closed his eyes, he would not have known he was eating chicken pho.  The bowl was the smallest size of PHO I have ever seen.  You have to upgrade to get a size that most other restaurants serve.  Glad we didn't upgrade on this PHO.  (NO BUENO)  Rating= 1

Oxtail PHO:  This was the best of the dishes.  Nice pieces of oxtail in it.  Rating=4

Fried Tofu:  Run of the mill fried tofu with an overly sweet sauce  Rating= 3

Service was friendly.  Unfortunately the service does not make up for the food.  
There are SO many good PHO places in Phoenix that it is a worth a trip from the West Side to the East side to get a good bowl of PHO."}
{"text":"Good ambiance with attentive servers. Good deal when you get the tea, spring roll, pho combo."}
{"text":"I've tried Pho before and did not like it. I read the reviews and had to try this place. 5 stars are not enough. They have great service and they helped me pick out what I'd like based on my dietary needs. This place was packed at 3:30 on a weekday and after eating there I know why."}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese food in the Valley. Good selection, and I love all the tea and boba options! They also have fresh coconut."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Delicious rice noodle salad with grilled pork and spring rolls. Wings were good too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The pho was very good and the prices were great. The only downside is It was busy, so the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"There are a couple of other Pho places in the area but this is the best hands down!  It's trully family owned and the care about the food and service.  Don't waste your time at the other pho options, just come here and enjoy the food.  We always add extra vegatables to our soup."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I'll definitely be back. Got tofu rolls, pho, and I had this gorgeous plate of everything. Also got a beautiful thai tea for the first time, I'm not a fan but that doesn't mean it wasn't good, thai tea might just not be for me :)"}
{"text":"We love coming to Pho Viet. The menu is extensive and the food is always served quick and delicious. We have tried a number of things on the menu. You can't go wrong with the pho - $1 more will get you a large bowl and chances are you will be going home with leftovers. My kids love the pork spring rolls and I always order the BBQ pork fried rice. 

The drink menu is also extensive. I love the thai tea and on our last visit my kids both ordered smoothies with boba - one thai tea, one mango. They both loved them. They also serve coconut water in the coconut which is always ordered when someone isn't feeling well. 

Pho Viet has ample seating and is very clean. The staff is always friendly and everything is reasonably priced. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! I had the number 14, rare beef and meatball.  The broth was delicious.  I loved the rare beef too. I probably won't get meatball next time.  It was kinda rubbery.  Not my favorite.  The Thai tea was also very tasty! The service was ok.  Didn't get checked on by the waiter for a long time when we were done eating.  We had to flag down another guy to bring us a take out container.  Didn't know you pay at the counter... Thy don't bring you a check.  I'll probably be back soon."}
{"text":"We woke up in Las Vegas and wanted some Bun Bao Hue and Oxtail Pho after careful consideration we drove home to Phoenix for the best Vietnamese food we have found in the U.S. We have now been here over 40 times in the last 2 years and have only been disappointed when we try other places. Thank you for the solid service and excellent food we will see you I am sure either this week or next."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with serving size or freshness. Spring rolls with peanut sauce is a light starter. The pho is super good and the plate of fresh veggies look like they were just picked from a secret garden in the back room. We eat here often and the owner and son recognize us and are friendly. I like the soft Vietnamese music playing for ambiance and authenticity while we're still able you watch a tv with the volume off."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered taste amazing! I have never tried this type of food before and can honesty say I will become a regular here from now on!

For appetizers we had  the number 1 which was 2 egg rolls, the number 2 which was their spring rolls with shrimp and if I remember  right also had pork in it. Main dish was number 14 I believe the Pho with steak and meatballs...we ordered a large with extra noodles!!! Wow that is a lot of food! Oh, and we also ordered a Mango tea with Boba  (not sure if I am spelling that right). Along with a mango smoothie with Boba. Both were phenomenal. 

There was absolutely nothing that we did not like from this place...again...AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"SUMMER IN AZ IS COMING. YOU'LL REGRET NOT TRYING THE BOBA HERE.
 I have enjoyed a great bowl of pho here a few times. The many times I do come in is because I am addicted to the boba smoothies. But lets start with the Pho.

Food:
I am the type of person who probably loves the broth more than everything else and being a native Californian we have many gear pho House. The broth here was excellent. It just mixed and sat well in my belly. Chicken and beef plates were grilled and marinated just right. Egg rolls were the 2nd best I've ever eaten. (I've had MANY egg rolls in these 26 years of life)

Boba:
This is separate from food due to it being a gift to mankind. I've tried 6 different flavors, all great but all time favorites: 1) mango 2)coconut
Boba, as you first sip, she captures you with her smooth, ice cold texture, then the boba create a game changer from drink to food, as the perfect combo is there.. Then comes the silky smooth milk taste of mango to pull you back in.... 

Customer service and decor: awesome!
The smell is the first thing to hit you when you walk in.. Its just so dang fresh. I am always greeted and feel like I'm at a friends House when I go there."}
{"text":"Great pho. Very fresh ingredients. Dining room was spotless. Service was very friendly and quick. Pho - the groovy noodle soup- was very good and also was very mellow, so ideal as a first introduction to someone who's never tried it. If you want to jazz it up with hoisin, fish sauce and chili sauce, it's all right there at your table."}
{"text":"I have been eating \"pho\" noodle soups now since 1985. Mainly all over Garden Grove Orange County California where the Pho phenomenon seems to have started. 
The way to judge a good bowl of Pho is by the broth.  Most Pho has good broth. But rarely do they have great memorable broths. Most people add some shiracha hot sauce and hoisen into the broth. Here it is not really  needed. This is the one of the best broths I have ever tried. Why would you want to mask these incredible flavors?  The chef will come out and greet you, he is eager to tell you about the merits of \"his\" broth. 
Pho  Viet has great broth as the base, with noodles fresh and properly cooked. The basil and vegetables are  another way to judge  Pho. When you are served pho soup, you will be presented with a plate of fresh basil, sprouts, greens, and maybe some other vegetable in which you will immediately break apart and add to the soup to intensify the flavors of the Pho. Here, the basil is so fresh! 
Many of the Pho soup variations have meats that most Americans are not comfortable eating such as tendons, tripe, etc , etc, you can order it without all of this such as just beef or chicken. Pho soup is not really about the meats anyway. It is all about the tasty broth and  rice noodles. 
The basil here is so fresh and fragrant it is as if it was picked minutes ago. The sprouts are fresh and crisp. MMMMM, great Pho!
The other day my friend had the chicken with lemongrass and ginger. The taste was great. You will also get a nice bowl of that heavenly soup broth with your meal. We both ordered the fresh spring rolls which had even more of that great fresh basil. 
As for service, this seems to be a family owned restaurant. I believe it may be ran by a brother and sister team.  They will treat you like family. Need I say more? For all those peoples who are not familiar with Vietnamese restaurants and have always wanted to try, come here. You will be yet anther \"pho\" convert. It has been opened for a few weeks now, I hope the chef keeps the \"fresh\" vision for years and years to come! 

P.s. If you feel unconfortable with chopsticks, just ask. They will bring you silverware."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Fresh, well prepared. We ordered 7 dishes and every one was excellent. The basil just rocked in the pho. My home is a 12 hour drive from here. I will be back. The food coma is setting in. I almost couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the vegan pho with a jackfruit boba tea. My date had the meatballs pho. Pho was amazing. I was pleased to find a vegetarian/vegan substitute for beef broth pho. The Yelp ratings were perfect for the food. 
 I also ordered a green tea ice cream maccoorn cookie. A bit disappointed. The cookie was dry and the frozen block almost broke my tooth. Maybe wrapping the cookie in freezer would help save the flavor and keep it moist. 
The reviews were also correct in regards to service. The waitress was there to take my order but once my pho was brought to the table she didn't come back. Didn't even stop by to check if the food was ok and only 4 tables were full. Seemed like a quiet night to me. We had to wave her down to ask for a dessert. After deciding on the cookie sandwich she quickly got it and dropped it in front of me with some paper wrapped around it. It Didn't even arrive on a plate. 
My date had to go to the counter to get the check and pay. Service was a disappointment. I leave 4 stars because of the food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just had dinner there tonight. The owner was wonderful explaining and recommending two choices that we could split and share. The customer service is wonderful. And the number 46 noodle dish was great. Asking for extra add-ins for the soup were brought promptly over. I will return again. Thank you to everyone"}
{"text":"Love love love this spot. I'm a student from a nearby university, and this was our favorite post-test or study break meal. There's something about the pho and fresh toppings (basil, jalapeños, bean sprouts) that always brightened up our dreary moments. It was usually me and one of my girl friends, and we were always convincing everyone else to come here when they wanted wings or something. Good times.

There are other options for pho in the area, but we kept coming back because prices were reasonable, food is delicious (and fast!), and it was nice to see the owners' familiar faces. It seems like its a family owned spot. They always say hello and ask how we're doing. They have some pretty funny hats/shirts on display in the front too, if you're into that.

Our usual was #14 -- I was super happy the meatballs were beef-only, because its a nice change from the flank or rare steak. I have also tried their vermicilli dishes and thai tea. I was never disappointed. Their spring rolls were good too, I have friends that ordered that to-go regularly."}
{"text":"Once again, Yelp helped us pick a winner.  Hubby was craving Pho, and FYI he is the big Pho expert in our house.  I just go along.  We were tired of Viet Kitchen, so I was excited to see a brand new Pho place not too far away.

Man oh man, so clean, modern, friendly,  5 stars just for being a pleasant environment.  But the proof was in the Pho and hubby was very very happy.  Boba was great.  Service excellent.   Menu is really extensive, so I was happy to have so many other choices.  lemongrass shrimp rice plate was nicely spicy, a little skimpy on actual shrimp, but the veggies tasted better anyway.  

Congrats to owners for opening and hope all goes very well.  

p.s. 43rd Ave and Bell is starting to be THE place to go for great food  (Here, Yen Sushi, and Mi Comida, BOOM, done!)"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phoenix!!! Get the meatball!!!!! Springs rolls are amazing. The staff is always so friendly and on the ball. The food comes out quick. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place , the staff is very good at making suggestions, the soups and the rice dishes I have tried are fantastic. Love the spring rolls. Yummy"}
{"text":"Great service, the family that owns this place are very friendly and personal. They get to know you, learn your orders and it's very clean."}
{"text":"The Pho here is very good and they give you a great amount of it for the price they charge. We tried the egg rolls as well and they're very good. 

The thing that I was bothered with was the Cripsy butter garlic chicken wings that we ordered. On there website they have a picture of this dish and it shows 6 wings on there and they charge $5.99 for them, which seems a bit much for me already. $1 per wing?! So we went and ordered them anyway and asked the waiter how many per order and he told us 5 in one order. But when they came out, there was only 4 in the plate and I had to ask them why. So he went back in the kitchen and asked the cook, and he came back and said that the cook gave us only 4 because one of the wings were a bit bigger (but to me they were just all regular size wings you get at the bar) So we ended up getting only 4 wings for $6+tax. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"First time going there. Once we walked in we were placed at a table. The menu I love! Has pictures with some of the food. Once we knew what we wanted the guy came right at us got our orders and within i don't know 10 mins we got our food I like it but I would just have to get used to the soups there but the rest of the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly spot with a TV and great food! Prices aren't bad and the seating is nice and comfortable. The menu is hard to understand because it's not"}
{"text":"What the pho...

This place is killing it!  It was highly recommended and actually blew my expectations away.  Located on the NE side of Bell and 43rd next to a furniture store.  The inside is medium sized and very clean and welcoming.  I was greeted and sat right away.  It was lunch time and the place was booming. 

I ordered a 14 and 115.  Large bowl of pho with tender beef and meatballs and a pork bahn mi sandwich.

The bowl was huge!  Filled with noodles, meat, veggies,  and even a side of veggies to add.  The flavor was exquisite.  Fresh, savory, spicy, and refreshing.  I downed the entire bowl.  The sandwich was also delicious. Fresh bread, tender pork, carrots and cilantro on top with a bomb ass sauce.  I could only finish half of it but believe me it wasnt for lack of desire.

The price was on point. 8 bucks for a huge bowl of awesomeness and 4 bucks for a flavor bomb sandwich.  Ill do that all day long.

Stongly recommend and seriously looking forward to trying other items."}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying that I didn't try the Pho....but I will be back so that I can! M y fiance and I had the spring rolls, and they were delicious and their peanut sauce to dip them in was excellent. For our entrees we each had a noodle bowl, mine had grilled pork and an egg roll and his had chicken, shrimp and an eggroll. All components of the dish were well executed and I thought the prices were fair. I am from an area very known for their vietnamese food, and I have found that it is hard to find what I like here in the Valley....this place really satisfied my craving. Aside from the food the service was great too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"15 STARS!!!!!!

Birthday dinner, AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best Vietnamese food and customer service in Arizona.  The Spousal Unit tried a Com Dac plate tonight and loved it.  I foresee many, many more lovely evenings at Pho Viet.

Did I mention I love the peoplez running this joint?  Hell yeahzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Since PHO's menu is so extensive I can always try some thing differed  to eat and that is always mouth watering bowl of PHO that is guaranteed  to  satisfy . Especially when suggested by the son of the owner. Every suggestion by him has be short of amazing. YES were hooked on this place,  yes were regulars, there, yes we know every one there. and yes this is out favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town.

Peter the owners son ha even made suggestions to try different n00dles to replace the ones that cone with them and all I can say is each time he does the soup gets better ad better! 

FOOD: PHO is delicious. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: Very modern. Exceptionally clean.  Bathrooms are very clean,.SERVICE: Outstanding. Everyone is very attentive, providing  excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a restaurant. I will be returning here to try their other delicacies! RETURN FACTOR: 100%
              
        *********** What does my OVERALL rating mean? **************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"Delicious Ban Mi for $4. This sandwich was the highlight of our meal yesterday. Their bread was nicely toasted. They had just the perfect amount of BBQ pork, pickled veggies and sauce. My 2 teenagers made short order of their sandwiches.

We also had the Pho Khong. The broth was light and savory. Not the best I have had, but ranks up there as decent. Because we had so many mouths to feed, we upgraded our bowl to a large one for $1.

Our BBQ pork rice dish wasn't bad either. The pork is the same as they use in the Ban Mi. The steamed egg was a smaller portion that I am used to, but their shrimp paste (tau hu khy) was alright. We added another side of the shrimp paste for $1.50. 

If you are a fan of Brick macaron and ice-cream sandwiches, they serve them here for $5. Don't be shocked by the tiny serving. It is cute and adorable but a little pricey for me. 

The service is very friendly. The restaurant is super clean and tables are spread out, giving privacy to diners. I can't wait to pick up more Ban Mi sandwiches. My kids said they'd eat it everyday for lunch if they could.

Tip: Pay at the counter."}
{"text":"This place was one of the better pho places I have tried in a long time. Fresh and delicious, I had the chicken pho and the Vietnamese coffee, both were stellar!!!"}
{"text":"We have always eating the pho at 19th ave and camelback, but last night we don't want to drive that far so we went to this place (pho viet ) ordered tendon pho and pad Thai , the tendon pho just had very few tendons , and the soup is alright  I think they used the powder to make the soup , the noddle they use in the pho soup is kind of thin.pad Thai is not real pad Thai , it's very different from the real Thai restaurant , the beef in the pad Thai was dry , but I understand tho.. I am in a Vietnamese restaurant ordered Thai food , what should I expect? Lol ..."}
{"text":"First time here and we really enjoyed our Pho and boba! My honey is pretty critical about Pho and he enjoyed it, said it was better than his Mom's! Now that is saying something! I ordered the Chicken Pho and taro boba, both were perfect! We also ordered the summer and spring rolls that were delicious as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place is so highly rated. My girlfriend and I decided to try it because everyone says it is so good. 

First problem we had was when my girlfriend ask if there was any other tea besides the jasmine and thai because their website listed green. The waitress said no so she just got a water. About 5 minutes later my girlfriend saw a sign that said the had black and green tea.

Next, the food took awhile. I got the marinated beef and she got the pho. We wait 30-35 minutes. We have never waited more than about 20 minutes at a Vietnamese place. 

To finish off everything, the food was bland, not hot, and small. The beef was so cold I didn't want to eat it. It was also very dry. The only good thing about it was it was tender. My girlfriend said the pho was just warm with no flavor. 

Let's just say we will not be returning. So sad to see that everyone else loves this place."}
{"text":"This place has great service! They have cute Tshirts for sale with puns about pho! This was our first time trying pho and it was really good but we didn't have anything to compare it to. It is family owned and they were super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Pho restaurant close to my office and with the nice quiet atmosphere that I enjoy during my lunch. This place was it! Very friendly staff and excellent food. I will be making this my regular stop."}
{"text":"The food are delicious, the staff and management are very friendly. The pricing is decent/average. They play good vietnamese music there. My favorite dish is Hu Tieu Dac Biet (forgot what number it is) lol comes with a variety of meats. You should try it if you ever stop by. Restaurant is very clean.  Visit and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a Vietnamese from Seattle and Pho Viet by far has the best pho in Arizona. I normally order Pho Dac Biet, and it's gooooood...a little heavy on the noodles and salt but not so stingy on the meat (as most other places are). The restaurant is clean and staff is super nice. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I'm always wanting the pho. I know that if the restaurant is known for the pho the other dishes probably won't be as good..it's like going to a steak house and ordering fish. If you're going to go here, at least go for the pho. 

I was worried moving out to Arizona that I was going to be deprived of my mom's cooking or Vietnamese food in general, so I'm glad to have found this place to satisfy those cravings."}
{"text":"I do care about customer service of places, this restaurant has a really good foods but the service was horrible!!!! Me and my friend have to wait 10 min to be greeted for drink and the waiter came back 10 min later just to tell us that they didnt have hot tea..then waited for another 10 min to have somebody take our order... And long time for our foods coming. And they werent that busy, the ladies accross the table who came after us already enjoy the food while we still waiting for our drink.WTF..but the food was very good hope the owner fix the service then it will be best place to go to.."}
{"text":"Pho soup and everything is delicious here with reasonable price! The owners are super nice too and best service in town. Traveled all the way from California just for this"}
{"text":"Food is probably a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to support my people's small businesses.  I ordered a rice dish and it had pretty authentic flavors but the thit nuong (grilled pork) was too dry.  I love Vietnamese egg meatloaf (cha) and the little piece I had was good but not warmed up enough. The bi (shredded pork skin) was very good and reminded  me of home. I had a sample of the pho broth and thought it had too much anise flavor without the depth of the meat bones.  Not sure if I'd eat pho if I came back but there are other dishes that looked good like banh xeo and papaya salad with liver and beef jerky, which i haven't been able to find anywhere else in AZ! Prices are also a little more than I'd except from a Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars is because of my son's meal. That was actually decent and edible. I was really excited to try this place due to all of the good reviews it received but was sadly disappointed. Being Vietnamese myself, I really expected much more from this restaurant. The spring rolls had nothing but old shredded lettuce with a couple shrimps in it and no noodles or mint.  The banh mi was very lacking and I couldn't even finish it and banh mi is one of my favorite things to eat. We will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"First time visit and really enjoyed this Pho restaurant.   Really a cool cultural feel upon entering.  Seated promptly.  

Had the Cha Gio egg rolls as an appetizer.  Delicious. 
Entree was #44 Egg noodle soup with BBQ pork.  Outstanding.  Easily the best soup I've had in Phoenix.

Food was just a little slow in coming out but that is true for most restaurant with excellent food.  

Priced very reasonably for the quality.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Good people watching.

I highly recommend this place and am looking forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"Stop at this place every time we drive to our house in Prescott from Ahwatukee!  The #18 Pho is the best and they give a large amount of Thai basil and bean sprouts which brings the dish together.  

The grilled pork sandwich is a must!  Grilled to perfection and seasoned so it melts in your Mouth on a perfectly toasted bun.  Could use a bit more fresh herbs on it, but still a great value!

2 large pho, 1 banh mi= $23.00 and you are stuffed on good food!"}
{"text":"Got myself a Pho Oxtail and its honestly so bland. Pho taste like they threw a bunch of MSG in it..
I've tasted better Pho Oxtail... Their oxtail was not cook in the Pho broth. Just by tasting the oxtail and looking at it, you can already tell that they boiled their oxtail instead of cooking in the broth with seasoning... 

The wait was about 10 minutes.. Not the best service was given but I guess it was alright. Was not greeted when I walked in.... 

$11.91 for Pho Oxtail! That is unbelievable high price for Pho. 

Sorry, would not come back.."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant.  Food is ok but I've had better Vietnamese soup. Service is decent."}
{"text":"The only place with vegetarian Pho in the area. It was delicious and the serving size was significant! A little heavy on the cilantro for my taste (but I'm not a fan of cilantro at all). Service was great!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food, will never go there again... My wife got a severe food poisoning having one of their famous soups..  The food tasted OK but never knew it could become this bad... I just can't imagine that there are so many good reviews, am I the only one who ordered the soup?? Dont know.. Anyway writing this review so that everyone out there can be cautious about this place and the food. 
Sad that I had to write a bad review but I just hope no one gets sick from this place again..."}
{"text":"This place is great. They serve authentic Vietnamese and their Pho is excellent. I like the beef pho with extra rare beef. They serve it on the side and you can put it in your soup to enjoy. My girlfriend loves their chicken and shrimp combo dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after searching Yelp on my way home.  My hunger was getting the best of me.

I had the dinner special - a bowl of soup, spring roll and tea.

the rice paper wrapped spring roll was rather nice and refreshing.  I liked it so much I bought two more to take home for lunch the next day.

The soup (noodle with beef) was OK.  I added on extra noodles (though i did not think it looked like extra noodles).  It was just an ok bowl of soup. 

Service was attentive and friendly.

I think I will be back to see if it is better (per the yelpers) the second time."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant a few weeks ago and i have become a bit of a regular. Any time I'm in there eating I notice that like me there are many regulars. Each time I have gone in the owner has remembered what I order and is happy to make any modifications I need. This is all a sign of a good restaurant. Their menu is extensive, the quality of the food is excellent, and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a very welcome addition to the Asian dining scene in the Valley. The food is excellent, as is the service and the atmosphere. The portions are generous, so I thought I would be bringing some part of the meal to take home. But because the food was so good, I ended up finishing everything. 

I love that this restaurant has dishes with the great flavors and great prices I've come to expect from my favorite Vietnamese restaurants, but the nice location and the  casual, modern relaxed atmosphere sets this apart from the others."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and got pho with beef and brisket. It was good. The broth was good. I came here the next day (today) and ordered rice porridge with chicken to go and I called 15 minutes ago but when I went to pick it up, I had to wait an extra 10 minutes because it wasn't ready yet, which was frustrating because I called to order for a reason: go, get the food, leave, no waiting. When I got home, the rice porridge kind of had a too watery consistency and I thought that was weird but overall, it was okay. Anyway, I'd probably come back for the pho."}
{"text":"My friends rant about this place all the time, so I finally stopped... I am SO GLAD!!
 I had NO idea what to order & the gentleman working there helped me PERFECTLY AND explained how to assemble the soup when I got home & it is SOOOO good! I'm so glad I got both a beef & chicken! I will eat the chicken one later!
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great pho. Only four stars for me because my favorite ox tail soup is a little dry in here. Otherwise they have a pretty good selection."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here because it truly is super delicious food. The owner Peter is wonderful and greets us by name and always makes sure we get an awesome experience with every visit. The Pho and Thai teas are amazing and they even explained which of the items on the menu were gluten free for me. Solid Pho restaurant with wonderful staff and owner. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Not only do you get the most fresh Pho here. You get some of the most friendly service here as well. Its always super clean inside, the staff is always super friendly and helpful, and the prices are right. Your food is always hot and fresh and comes out fast. I get the Pho to go here often, and even out a to-go bag this is some of the most flavorful and heart warming Pho I have had to date. So if you love Pho you will love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved out to Lake Havasu, AZ temporarily from the Bay Area of California. Compared to the Bay Area, however, Lake Havasu has very few shopping or eating options and one of the things we love to eat most is delicious Pho and Banh Mi and this place is the spot to get just that. Every time we come to Phoenix we have to make time to do lunch or dinner (most often both) at Pho Viet. They are super friendly, generous with refills and offer some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever had. If you're in the area you should give this place a definite taste."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on their Pho #13, great base broth with no funky extra flavors and you season to your taste.  Great clean flavor! I feel revived every time I eat it. Yes you should make it a large and maybe you'll take some left over to go even if it's just broth and noodles.  I've got it to go a few times and they set you up nicely with all the trimmings. Hands down the best Pho I've had.  Lunch special is perfect with a spring roll or egg roll and drink.  A must try! I keep forgetting to take a pic to post cause I usually dig in so fast and forget. Lol"}
{"text":"Refreshing to have a bowl of Pho broth!  Love the Pho here with lots of choices. Order the egg rolls as an appetizer."}
{"text":"The Thai Tea is amazing as well as the Tara Bobba..this place has only been open since 5/16/13 and I feel like it has been open for longer Peter & Maggie are very friendly and go out of their way to make your experience a good one."}
{"text":"Still coming here because it is sooooo good. Usually do pickup and they get my order correct every time. They never shorted my order or served me something bad.Well once a long time ago , but one out of 30 visits is far better than any other restaurant I have ever patronized.  I hope they are here for a long time!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my first impression was 2 stars. This was due to the service, my daughter and I sat for 15 minutes without service or acknowledgement. They were busy but I have been to many restaurants where that is not an issue. So why the 5 stars? Once they took our orders it went uphill from there. We started with crispy eggrolls which were GBD. My daughter had the rice paper roll with pork and shrimp which was excellent. We tried the fried wings with butter, a must try. The bbq pork bahn mi sandwich my daughter ordered was tasty.

Now the pho; amazing. I can tell they skimmed the fat off because there isn't a tacky film in your mouth. The broth was clean and still flavorful. I asked for chili oil on the side and they obliged. All in all it was a pleasant experiance. Oh, the \"IDGA PHO\" tee shirt is a must buy if you are a pho-natic. So even though it was a 20 minute drive here it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Tried the Bon bu hue, it had a spicy kick in the broth and lots of flavor in the soup. 
Surprisingly had a a lot of cuts of meat, very delicious. 

Looking forward to coming back. Downside it was kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Really, for those who have not tried Vietnamese, you're missing out. It's a delicious, cheap, filling meal - especially if you're into pho.

This is the second time I've been to Pho Viet (the first visit was not Yelped) in recent weeks and am enjoying it immensely. Had the pho tai and our waitress courteously inquired if I wanted the meat on the side. I tried the beef raw to test its quality and it was slightly sweet and lean. I honestly don't know where other Yelpers get their \"my pho was fatty\" issues from because my experiences have had very little fat (oil?) present.

The other half ordered Korean BBQ beef short ribs - again, very tasty. Our waitress inquired a couple minutes after serving us if she would like a knife to cut her ribs - definitely attentive! About the only trouble is having your bill brought to the table in a timely fashion. While most other restaurants don't even wait for you to finish before setting the bill on the table, Pho Viet takes several minutes after your plate has been ushered into the kitchen to show it. Anyone in a rush may need to flag their server (hopefully they work on this if monitoring Yelp reviews!)

Cheap eats, tasty food, nice strip mall dining experience."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, as the ambiance and service are excellent, with friendly wait staff, and a clean dining area. It is clearly a popular restaurant as there are many patrons there this evening. However, the Pho Dac Biet I ordered fell below my expectations: the broth fluctuated between the salty and bland side, and the meat flavorless as well. I added more Hosin Sauce and Sriracha, as well as sliced jalapeños but it did not make much improvement to my palate. I'd really like to rate this place higher, but I just didn't experience the flavors I expected in a bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"Massive menu. Great pho and a lot of other options- including great little apps. The lunch crowd files in and almost fills the place up. We will certainly be back with our brood!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! Everything was so delicious. I had egg rolls and pho tai chin. They're iced coffee was great as well, and then there was the macaroon ice cream sandwich, which was SO good!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your pho fix.  The prices are decent and they also sell the Vietnamese pancake.  If you're craving Chinese wonton soup try the me noodles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome love the food and the atmosphere.  try the pho dac beit it was awesome.  we also pick up on way home when we dont have time to cook."}
{"text":"Pho-real! My brother and I went here yesterday for a crepe and Pho. The crepe had shrimp, pork and bean sprouts. They have a special for a bowl of Pho, spring or egg roll and a drink for $10. We took advantage of that and made them large bowls for $1 more. The place is clean, service was great and the food was tasty. Tip: You pay at the counter. The ladies' room is on the opposite side of the men's room. I accidentally opened the door to the kitchen thinking it was the ladies' room. HA! Also, you can buy some clever Pho t-shirts while you are there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite PHO restaurant on the West Side! Nothing compares to their broth. The flavor is on point. Great, fast service too. We eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very delicious food with vegetarian and vegan options. I have come to really like this locally owned place. The hard working staff moves very fast to give you excellent service. 
Cleanly environment, delicious and healthy food, great service, options for all lifestyles, this mom and pop joint is a great place to eat at if you like the Vietnamese cuisine. I will certainly continue my patronage of this place for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"The wife ordered chicken pho with egg noodles, she sighed with delight with her first spoonful of soup. I ordered the wonton soup, just as delightful. We are visiting from Alaska, so most likely won't get the chance to come back, but it appears many locals are regulars as they were personally welcomed by the owner."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat pho! They have a special 7 days a week that includes a regular bowl of pho, spring roll and a drink for $10!!! It's a family owned restaurant and I've never had a bad experience with customer service or the food. I recommend this place to anyone interested in eating some good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"We tried this out tonight, and are completely impressed by every part of the experience. I got the noodle soup with the beef and it was phenomenal. The beef is cut extremely lean, no fat whatsoever on the meat, and the broth was rich and delicious. My wife got a chicken, noodle and vegetable plate (don't remember exactly what it was called) and the portion was so large that it could have fed both of us.

The service was great, the turn around for the food was quick, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Getting my lunch pho fix here at Viet Pho... Best pho in town, never disappointed with the food and service here!!! Will be back soon for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"By the time I get to Phoenix, I'll be hankering...for a taste of something from back home. Jimmy Webb was a great songwriter, wasn't he? Anyway, you never quite expect to find good pho in Glendale among the strip malls, but sometimes you just get plain lucky. I was down there for business (...what else?) when a new colleague of mine took me here for lunch. Little did I know he was into pho and good pho at that. It was indeed in something of a strip mall and looks to be family-run with the owner quite familiar with my colleague, a good sign. The menu was surprisingly robust, and the place was hopping during the lunch hour (photo: http://bit.ly/2ae8v6a).

I decided we should share the bargain-price Goi Cuon at $3.75 for a hearty duet of spring rolls with pork and shrimp, as fresh as I've had in Little Saigon back in San Francisco and accompanied by a particularly rich peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2ae8gI7). For my bowl, I decided on the $7.75 Pho Ga, which was chock full of tender pulled chicken in a light, clean broth festooned with cilantro and onions (photo: http://bit.ly/29Qfeks). Just wish they offered giblets, tendons and hearts on the side. Seriously. Even though we were starting to feel the Southwest heat outside, the comforting taste of pho was like balm in a burrito-saturated city like Phoenix. Food snob? Yep, right here.

FOOD - 4 stars...pleasant surprise to find a good bowl of pho in these parts
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just a part of the suburban sprawl
SERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and timely
TOTAL - 4 stars...definitely plan on coming back on the next business trip"}
{"text":"Great service. The egg rolls were good except they only gave us one piece of lettuce for two egg rolls. I got the pho tai which would've been much better if the soup wasn't so salty. I also ordered a strawberry Boba but the Boba wasn't thoroughly cooked which is disappointing. I'm hoping they will improve because this place is close to my house and I'd love to become a regular."}
{"text":"Went there during a weekday... half full with customers. 

Order the pho and the egg roll - custom service was good, however the egg roll never came. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places that I've had Vietnamese food. The staff is very helpful and kind and food is delish and well priced. Of all the places I go to for pho especially, I return here the most!"}
{"text":"We always buy the same thing from every Pho restaurant we visit, but this time, I didn't try the pho. According to my husband, he says that this is the best pho he's had so far in Arizona. 

I ate the shrimp and beef spring rolls which weren't too bad. I'm just used to the peanut sauce having that strong peanut-flavor, and I could really taste vinegar in it. It wasn't bad, nonetheless."}
{"text":"Rad place, great food, service was awesome and made us laugh....if ur wanting and dam good bowl of Pho its a most!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially in the fall and winter time. The Pho is always great, and it's fast and affordable. I also enjoy their sandwiches and rolls as well. It's one of my favorite Pho spots in the valley!"}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place.  It was big, clean and in a good location in regards to where I work.  The people were really friendly and greeted you right away.  I ordered the Chicken Pho and it was amazing!  The broth had a great flavor and really hit the spot.  They give you a lot of fixings (bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc).  I also tried the egg rolls and they were pretty good.

I am a fan and will return to try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho Gha. Broth could have used a little more complexity in flavor but the table ready condiment selection added some zazz. I would return."}
{"text":"Went back again today. I got the pho with rare beef, tendon, tripe and beef balls.  It was so good.  My soup was suppose to also have brisket and flank but I told them to hold it.  With me holding the two other proteins, I thought I would get more other proteins but I didn't.  oh well, it was still good maybe I should ask next time.  I also got the shredded pork with pork skin spring rolls, the skin was tough to eat so I will stick with my pork sausage spring rolls."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having Vietnamese food and although I am sure I am not a aficionado I will say it was delicious! The wait staff was as friendly as can be given the obvious language barrier and the food was good. I had a large shrimp phó, my girlfriend had a regular phó ga and we shared a appetizer all for $22 which I feel is pretty reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Pho Viet and I always order my favorite dish which is Co'm Chien or fried rice with jumbo prawns and chicken. You can get whatever meat you want in your friend rice and that's the best part about Pho Viet!

Also check out their new t-shirt design. The grey shirt made me laugh. It is the trend that every Pho restaurant in the world or this country must design their funny Pho shirt now. Pho Ga! I love it!!!

There are new items such as Vietnamese sandwiches on the menu besides Pho and Bobba that you can try but I always go back to my favorite fried rice to the first day that I tasted it when I first worked at Pho Viet during their Grand Opening. Great Vietnamese food, great memories, great family and friends at the restaurant. Say hello to all of the family at Pho Viet when you see them! It doesn't matter who you are. They are the friendliest and the best to make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Had some really tasty shrimp pho today. Broth was great. Got the beef togo and it was just as good.  I love spring rolls but these didn't really do it for me. The fried egg rolls were pretty god though. Crispy, not too greasy. All in all, definitely worth going back for!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. If I'm in the mood for Pho and in the area, I'd stop in.  But I'd never take a special trip there.

Spring rolls were bland.
Pho was a bit more oily that what I'd expect.
Garlic chicken wings very oily.
Service is good however."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is one of those places that I just don't get the rave reviews about. You see tons of 5-star reviews, but... I really thought it was just ok. 

I will say the place is very clean and looks recently  renovated or freshly decorated on the inside. 

And, they get major points for being 'punny' (see tee shirt photos). 

My husband thought his pho bowl was pretty good, but I was just not impressed with the fried rice (it had just an off-flavor to it; reminded me of the smell of meat that's got one day left before it goes bad), and I thought the rice wrapped roll appetizer was too gummy / sticky and lacked any real distinct flavor. 

With so many great Asian places in the valley, I'm not sure I'd go back. But, I wouldn't discourage others from going, they did have some positives, it just didn't do much for me personally."}
{"text":"We eat here several times a week. We love Vietnamese food and this place satisfies our cravings.

Peter, who is the owners' son and chef goes out of his way to make sure you get exactly what you want.

The pho is great and always piping hot and fragrant."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've had in the valley. Being a vegetarian, I called ahead to make sure they would be able to accommodate my needs. They made me a completely vegetarian pho - which was absolutely out of this world, soul-warming, face-glowing, asian soul phood (see what i did there?) phonomenal. The vegetarian spring rolls were very fresh, high quality, and my avocado smoothie had actual chunks of avocado in it. Aside from the food the service was excellent, they were very eager to please, and the space itself is extremely clean, nicely decorated, and not what you would expect from the outside. 

My boyfriend, who had never tried pho, is now a convert and we will absolutely be back. Probably later this week."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food ever. Their vermicelli dry boodle bowls are life. So flavorful and filling. Plus it is pretty healthy since there are veggies and protein. It has everything you should be eating in a whole day. Probably this could fill you up for the whole day and keep you happy. I am a die hard dieter and this is something I eat. (Besides the fact that I'm doing the one meal a day diet so I don't feel as bad ;) Anyways, I recommend this place to any asian food lovers."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I'm always looking for good vietnamese restaurants around my area. 
I went with my cousin and we both ordered veggie pho. The pho was really delicious. The only flaw I'd have to say it had was that the broth was a little bit too salty for my liking. I also ordered the spring rolls and a mango boba smoothie. Both were really tasty, to say the least!"}
{"text":"Cleanest and greatest viet places I have ate at... Love it definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"There Banh Canh broth isn't very savory. I wouldn't recommend the banh canh."}
{"text":"Only one time I tried vietnamese here and I dont want to try again. Its too much smelly..I could not complete even 10% of the food.."}
{"text":"Wow. That's all I can say. Outstanding food and service. The pork broth pho is unbelievable, makes me hungry just thinking about it. If you like good pho, you must try this spot."}
{"text":"I will keep coming back to this place. I had the steak and shrimp pho. Crazy good love the broth and noodles. I also have a lychee with bobo. It was ok just not something I would order again. Probably try another flavor."}
{"text":"This place is brand new with a nice comfortable atmosphere and I was told they are still working on the menu and it will be shortened because it's way too long. 

My first choice was discontinued from the menu so I went with what they call Com Ga Nuong. It was described as marinated grilled chicken with Ginger, Lemongrass, Shallots, and Garlic. It sounds really good. I've had this similar dish at a few other Vietnamese Places so I was expecting a different presentation. But the number one thing that bothered me about the dish was the lack of the flavors mentioned in the description. This dish at Pho Viet only was garnished with 2 pieces of cucumber and two tomato slices and it did come with a large portion of rice and a very mild fish sauce with very finely shredded carrots in the fish sauce. 

I also did sample the beef and meatball Pho. To me it was less flavorful than others I've tried but not awful and just OK.

Both meals were hot and fresh served in a timely manner. 

If you are in the area you should put them on your rotation and see what you think.

The owners are very welcoming to criticism as I did mention the lack of flavor to them in the chicken dish. 

2.5 rounded up for welcoming criticism."}
{"text":"Ever since the shut down of the Pho shop across the street, I have been looking for a new favorite Pho place in Glendale. Pho Viet has taken the mantle.

Pho Viet is your traditional Vietnamese restaurant. Here you will find your hot steaming bowl of Pho, your traditional spring rolls, fried rice, beef luc lac, etc...

Service here is very friendly although occasionally a bit gruff (not a contradiction - it is possible to be friendly and gruff, at least at Pho Viet). Food comes quickly and they are always happy to modify any menu items to suit your taste (and depending on availability, you can request items that are not on the menu).

Portion sizes have always been on the moderate side, although I have noticed that they have increased their portion sizes considerably, which is a very welcome change compared to some other places that have been reducing their portions recently. However, bear in mind that the comparison is being made to the extremely huge portion sizes found at many Vietnamese restaurants, so unless you are famished, you will not leave this place hungry.

If you are in the mood for a traditionally prepared bowl of Pho, this is probably the best place in town right now."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in AZ! Love the food. Love the service. And love their custom T-shirts!"}
{"text":"New to Phoenix and our search for a good pho place is over. $10 special is on point: bowl of pho, spring or egg roll, and a soft drink. We upgraded to a large bowl for a dollar more. Good service, fair prices. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The service is great here! I eaten there and had take out and it's still amazing every time. I'm Vietnamese and this place is pretty darn close to authentic Vietnamese food! I wasn't a big fan of the bun bo hue but everything else is fantastic"}
{"text":"I love their pho, we have been coming here for a while now since we have moved here from Cali.  But for today's experience I ordered a pineapple boba smoothie and it had a secret ingredient... a dead fly!!! It was so gross!!!! I started to dry heave.  For the future I will not be buying smoothies with boba from here I have not ever been an exotic eater I don't have the stomach for it."}
{"text":"We drive over an hour to get here and eat! Lol the #22, #47, and boba Thai tea! Are my go-to and So delicious"}
{"text":"Awesome food love the sandwiches just had spring rolls they ere great too.  Everyone is really nice and it is family run."}
{"text":"Cute little Viet restaurant. Fast, fresh food and friendly service. 

Ordered #45 (egg noodle soup with veggies and tofu) to-go, brought it home and it was steaming hot and delicious. :-)"}
{"text":"Being from OC California I've got a pretty good idea on Vietnamese food. After being let down I found this place. The pho is spot on, and the spring rolls will have you wishing you still had room to eat more. Generous portions, easy on the wallet and just good food. Fresh"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vietnamese food places! I usually come here for the pho (with flank or the brisket) always satisfying (I just wish the lime wedges they give you were a little bigger) the broth is so flavorful!! The bánh mi grilled pork sandwich is also a favorite, the toasty bread, grilled pork and the crunchy veggies always hit the spot! But hands down, my all time favorite thing here is their Vietnamese coffee, it's sooo delicious, creamy, flavorful and smells amazing. I've been here multiple times and have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Did not give me my complete take out order and did not notice until I got home since they tie up the entire order in a bag. They forgot to include my extra side of rice that I paid for in my take out order. Paid extra money for nothing, will not be returning. Automatic 1 star beware when ordering to go.

Follow up... Just found a hair underneath my grilled pork... Sigh"}
{"text":"Wow. I really was looking forward to this place.  I wanted to try something different than my regular Vietnamese place.  I WAS very interested with the overall reviews for Pho Viet.  I don't know if I may have tried this place for the first time, on their OFF day.  But they were not busy with customers at all. There must have been less than 8 people during the time I went.

PROS:
* New, beautiful, spacious, nicely decorated and clean.
* Food arrived timely and temperature of the food was good.
* Host was attentive with water. (But forgetful/non attentive about everything else.)

CONS:
* Combo Pho meal: (I don't recommend it. Its not a good value for your money or your tastebuds.)
Includes: your choice of pho, a spring roll or egg roll and a can of soda at $10.  
Here is the con about the combo deal, it really isn't a deal when the serving size of the pho is not displayed as small and I mean smaller than your average small bowl at a pho house. Because of the lack in portion size, this really isn't a value.  

* Host/Server:  
I specifically informed that I do not eat pork and requested NO pork in my spring roll. He said okay and when repeating the order, he didn't mention that. So I mentioned again, you have down NO pork and shrimp only? He said yes. However, my spring roll I ate had pork throughout it!  

I also asked for pho tai and for meat to be served on the side, since I like to place it typically in hot broth for it to cook at medium rare. It was served to me completely cooked... Okay, not a problem although they immediately noticed the error and offered to give me a new one. But I didn't want to make a fuss about it and really not an issue, it was already done and I was completely fine with it. Although, there are only (3) items for the combo special, my drink was forgotten about entirely. 

* Side garnish vegetables:
It was not fresh. Wilted, dry and blackened on the ends. :(

* Service:
During my dining experience I had pleasantly tried to catch the attention of the host and he didn't acknowledge me and he was only a couple of feet away from our table.  His coworker in the back had to flag him down and get his attention and she caught my attempts and she wasn't even in clear view.

If anyone knows pho and is familiar with authentic pho broth, you are accustomed to the broth having a pleasant aroma.  However, this broth l had was scentless.  I tried the broth and it had a distinctive note of star anise and nothing else and it overpowered the dish. Even after adding hoison sauce, lime and chili sauce it was still flavorless and the strong taste of star anise was prominent. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in this overall experience.

Great for those regulars who like this place. Let me know if it was an OFF day for this place. Unsure, if I will return after this review."}
{"text":"Love the pho soup. The service is quick and friendly. The spring rolls are also superb!"}
{"text":"I do not know much about Vietnamese food, I have been to Vietnamese restaurants only 3 times.

But my friend at work treated me to lunch for my birthday and I was craving a soup, so I looked for pho and found this place.

It was easy to find and with plenty of parking.

Everyone in there was super friendly and nice. Great service and very accommodating.

I think I had #16 (PHO soup w/sliced rare tender beef, flank, tendon, tripe) and it was outstanding. My friend had pho with chicken, shrimp and extra veggies.

I cannot speak about drinks because we had only water, but I am looking forward to go back and try the milk coffee.  : )"}
{"text":"I use to go to Angelina's on 53rd, until I discovered this place. The place is so much better - pho broth is  delicious! I think it's ran by a family - nice people.  Will be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars but the waitress doesn't understand order well enough.i asked for extra veggies  (even at an upcharge) and very little noodles. Got the usual because she didn't quite understand. Food was great though."}
{"text":"I came, I saw PHO and I conquered. I am from Los Angeles, CA and it's pretty impressive to find a pho restaurant in Arizona. There's a lot of pho restaurants in Los Angeles but I was so amazed to find one in Phoenix. As a pho lover, I just knew I had to stop by before my road trip to the canyons and boy, was I glad I did!!!

The owners are extremely friendly and hospitable. And I'm not gonna lie, the PHO was pretty up to par with the PHO in LA, if not I would say it's just as good or dare I say it, better. 

On top of that, there's plenty of parking which is the best thing ever. The owner also suggested some pretty bomb lychee boba. It was perfect for the trip in this hot Arizona heat!"}
{"text":"The customer service is really really bad. The little Vietnamese boy working there with the American accent is super rude. A real punk loser. The woman act Threatened when a young pretty woman comes in. And they can't stop staring if you're another race. The food was cold and nasty"}
{"text":"I loved the Bun Bo Hue!!  After a night of drinking it seemed like the perfect remedy.  The broth was spicy and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  The beef and pork combined with the broth was spot on amazing. There is something about this soup that makes you feel better.  The staff is friendly and attentive, great service!!"}
{"text":"The boba here is to die for! Best I've had ever! The service is very friendly, quick and polite. I love the tofu rolls here and so many vegan  options for me with lots of meat selections for my husband. You get a plate with fresh basil, sprouts, limes and peppers for your pho  it's always very clean and quick and looks like a favorite for lots of people. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Meh. I took my coworkers here a few days ago. We all ordered different vermicelli. The meat was good but the dish lacked color."}
{"text":"This is the closest Vietnamese place near my workplace, so it works for me when I'm craving pho. I usually order the spring rolls and rare beef pho, they use cucumber slices in the spring rolls (which I don't particularly care for) but everything else still tastes pretty good. I like the service and I'll definitely continue ordering here."}
{"text":"OK so I thought this place was pretty great when we first started coming. It was new,  clean, modern with classic viet dishes. 

Service is a hit or miss,  mostly miss.  It's a Vietnamese restaurant so I wasn't expecting much,  and I didn't want over-service,  either. But..  Just a bit more effort than throwing two menus down after having the customers seat themselves and just walking away. No,  it wasn't busy or anything. It's kind of surprising because there are mostly young servers so idk, maybe jaded already? 

The lack of stars is the food. If you are coming here I would stick to soup or broth dishes,  like pho. The rice plates are one of the most disappointing I've ever seen. I don't think it was like this in the beginning. The rice plates should fill you up because of rice, meats, and accompanying sides.  But it's just small,  period.  

The egg cake / steamed egg / egg loaf side is gray colored and smells off. The shredded pork smells unsettling too. The meat is small portioned.  The Bo Luc Lac, or filet mignon with rice,  is a premier, pricier dish in viet restaurants. I tasted it off a friend's plate and was not expecting how bland and chewy it was. It's a gray color that doesn't give you the impression it's quality beef that was prepared at the time of the order..  (if you're going through the pictures, it definitely did NOT look like the one from 2013) 

I'm being really specific because I actually don't encounter this at all with rice plates in any other place. 

I did eat the chicken fried with red rice a while ago a couple of times. I thought it was good even though the chicken was dry and the rice wasn't too red. It didn't come with any sides so maybe I was spared because of that reason. 

Pho is okay. The thinly sliced beef in it could be better but I think it's decent overall. The Bun Rieu, a crab shrimp broth bowl, is a little less than OK because the flavor could be stronger. 

So anyway,  stick to your soups."}
{"text":"Their egg rolls and spring rolls are very good, well made and the ingredients were nice and fresh. The combo fried rice I also had was disappointing. The kind of rice the used was not appealing, it also lacked flavor and spice, and the beef was tough."}
{"text":"Yelp...ya let me down on this one...I got the Tender Beef and Brisket and my sister got the Chicken with Chicken Broth; broth was tasty in both, but the dishes lacked veggies and the meat was unbearably dry...needless to say, far from \"tender\".  Oh, also got the Chicken Spring Roll appetizer...also dry and the sauce was very watery. I'm surprised that they have so many stars...maybe it was an off day? It was dinner time and there weren't many people in the place, so perhaps they've gone downhill a bit."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've come here a ton of times with family and with work friends. I love this place! I come here more than any other restaurant. I've tried so many different foods and dishes and have many favorites. Service is great!"}
{"text":"Randomly found this place with the hubby. We were hungry and craving some Vietnamese. We ordered some pork/shrimp spring rolls... Which were okay. Wasn't much of a fan of the peanut sauce. Hubby got the pho (#12) which was really good. The wonton soup was pretty good too. Their grilled pork bahn mi left much to be desired. 
Service was okay at best. Place was clean. Most likely wouldn't return except to have a bowl of the pho."}
{"text":"Great clean place to get some food. The service is great and the food is good.  The pho is amazing here and can't be beat."}
{"text":"The food is very good and the customer service is great. I got a large pho with chicken it is very great"}
{"text":"Just came back from Pho Viet and I will not be returning. 

My friend and I were served old moldy basil and bean sprouts that were brown and soggy. The server was annoyed when I asked for a new set. The second plate was not much of an improvement. They were old.

The noodles in my spicy beef noodle soup were over cooked and soggy. I asked the server if I could have the noodles replaced. Instead of understanding that the noodles were overcooked she got defensive and said the consistency is suppose to be very soft. I have had Vietnamese food multiple times. It's my go to comfort food. I know what the consistency should be. Instead of just replacing the noodles, the server brought back a bowl that had less meat then before and noodles that were cut up into 2 inch pieces. 

This experience alone made it obvious that this restaurant does not care about making their customers. This was my fourth time and my last time eating at this restaurant. I don't understand how they have 4.5 stars. All four visits I experienced terrible service and had poor quality food. Save your money and the room in your stomach."}
{"text":"This place has very delicious, aromatic, authentic pho. Regretfully, the prices and the portions of the soups offered do not honestly reflet the generosity you may find at an heirloom Vietnamese restaurant. The staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is clean and modern. (IE: There isn't an old lady sitting in the corner reading a Vietnamese newspaper swatting flies) A potential 5/5 restaurant once they offer some sort of compromise on the pricing and/or portions of the pho they serve. Need a more affordable place with munificent portions? Look no further than Da Vang or Pho Thanh..."}
{"text":"Tried this place after going to the movies for a Sunday outing and everything we had was excellent.  We had the grilled chicken rice rolls and the flank steak Pho (26) and it was amazing!  Such a great combination of flavors, textures.  I also really appreciated that they had futbol playing on TV.  The boba thai tea was phenomenal, but a l tad bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"I have no idea what I ordered but it was meat broth and veggies. 

The meat was supposed to be meatballs but was more of a sausage. The veggies were all good and te broth was awesome after adding it all together. 

The staff was really cool, checking on me and refilling waters etc. 

I liked it but and still scared....

PS great for a head cold!"}
{"text":"Maybe this joint is known for pho (we didn't have any); maybe I'm spoiled from living in Seattle. This food was basically inedible to us. Worst \"Vietnamese\" we've ever been served. Had about 3 bites then had to toss it."}
{"text":"Peter is killing it!!! His broths for his pho and bun bo hue are on point, and full of long simmered, well seasoned flavors. Gracious service, warm ambiance, clean, well lit dining room makes for a winning recipe for success. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for lunch.  The restaurant is very clean with a nice, casual vibe, great prices, and fast service.  The people are friendly, and the food is always fresh and delicious.  You can't go wrong ordering the special that comes with a bowl of pho, choice of egg roll or spring roll, and can of soda, for about $10.  But they have more than just pho!  Their other menu items are also very good.  I've enjoyed some of the entrees with grilled meats and rice.  Probably my favorite thing to get is a noodle bowl (the Bun section on the menu).  It's like a cold noodle salad with choice of meat/egg roll topping and a sweet, mild fish sauce as dressing.  (See photo.)  So good!

Highly recommend this place.  Easy to see why they have so many regulars.  5 Stars."}
{"text":"I was in the area, looking for comfort food, I wanted to eat Asian food.
Vietnamese food and my tummy get along really well.  I was going to try noodle as I missed the food truck (ramen) earlier in the day, I was hoping to eat Pho.

After started looking through so many pages of menu, I decided to try Grilled shrimp and pork rice dish. After I saw some pictures, I added fried egg on my rice. I thought it was like loco moco to put egg over rice.  Turning the menu all the way back, they have many drink selection.  I couldn't resist but order boba drink.

I was very pleased with my shrimp and pork dish, nice flavor, and was glad I added the egg.  Boba drink was just okay. Unfortunately tapioca was still partially frozen and I think most of the tapioca was larger than think straw they gave me. I had to take the lid off to eat the remaining of tapioca.  Lychee tasted like regular lychee. They were frozen but I still liked them.

Since the rice dish pictures looked so good on menu, I couldn't try the noodle.  Next time I will only look at the pho section of the menu so I won't be tempted to order something else.

I will be back here again."}
{"text":"Great food. Kids love it. Always good service. Very consistent,  I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has great pho! The broth was light and not too overpowering and I liked the service I got from there! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service was decent, we went in knowing what to order but still had to wait 15 minutes to order. About 5 minutes into the restaurant we were served 2 waters with ice without asking us what we want to drink when usually we do not ask for ice in our waters. 

So the waitress came and asked for our orders, we told her and then she repeated it back to us all wrong, so we told her again. 5 minutes later our food came out, 2 very small Pho bowls with small pieces of meat and small portions of noodles. The only good thing was the broth which is very important when it comes to Pho.

Point is, we ate it and we were still hungry, also the service was mediocre. I gave this place 3 stars due to a mosquito or gnat being in our beansprout side dish.

J out."}
{"text":"Don't get the high review ratings. Bad service. Super slow to take our order. Then we get our pho, which was warm, not hot, and bland, with maybe 10 noodles in it?! And we had also ordered an order of spring rolls .... Which we did not get before our meal arrived... And I saw a table who sat down 10min after us get their order of spring rolls. Thought I'd wait to see if they'd bring it out. Finished our meal and still no spring rolls. After we received our food, never had another server come to our table. No do you need anymore water ? Or how's your food?   Will not be back again. My husband and I both left still hungry and he drove right across parking lot into whataburgers drive thru."}
{"text":"So close to home and when the gym was open so close to that! My girlfriend and I go for Boba and they'll even let you mix flavors. The Pho is great and eventually I'll have to try some of their other entrees but I'm sure I wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"was apprehensive about this place seeing as how ive gone to the same place for pho for almost ten years. All of my fears where wiped away as soon as i walked in the door. The establishment is very very clean unlike alot of other strip mall pho spots ive been to. The staff is more than helpfull and extremely friendly but to top it off the Pho is out of this world AWESOME!!! I cant recomend this place enough!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this establishment while looking for a cure to our PHO desire. We recently moved to the opposite side of town so didn't have a particular place...until now. Friendly, laid back atmosphere, good food, fair prices has made this our new Viet place. The hot green tea I ordered was great and freshly made, as a vegetarian I recommend the vegetarian spring rolls (#3)"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food, and there aren't many restaurants on the north side, so I was happy to see this one.  I don't understand the reviews that are higher than 3.  Inside, it looks OK.  We got spring rolls, which were OK, except they seemed to have ground pork inside instead of sliced, so it made a mess when eating them.  But the worst was the chicken bun.  Probably 1/3 to 1/2 of the chicken had chunks of cartilage attached, and several even had BONE attached!  After gagging on the first bite of cartilage, I picked through the chicken carefully and found so many big pieces of cartilage and bone attached that I finally threw the whole thing away.  Repulsive.  Also the liquid has way too much fish sauce.  I actually like the flavoring that fish sauce adds, but this was overpowering.  But then the gross cartilage and bone made me want to throw up.  I'm getting nauseated thinking about it now.  I have recommended many restaurants in the past, but this is definitely not one of them, and we won't return."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese cafe that my wife and I have ever tried.  When I brought some home, she pretty much immediately had a craving for more.

The service is typical for oriental-style restaurants; basic, but effective.  NOTE:  You pay at the register.  There's a little sign by the register telling you to do this.  Nobody ever sees it, since you'd only see it if you were already going to the register...

The ambiance is simple, and everything is clean and in good shape."}
{"text":"First time coming here. It was a disappointment.  When I came in I was with my family. We were seated and another group came in after. The other group got served water first and received their meals before us. We only got our water 10min later. The food was another disappointed. I had the beef soup and the beef was stuck together and it had a weird smell. I decided to try it because I didn't want to judge the appearance. When I tried it, it was bland and had a weird taste. I couldn't even eat it. Neither could my family. It was my first & last time here. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine."}
{"text":"So I'm always on the look out for good Pho.  It's one of my staples when it comes to food.  
I visited this place as it's near my work.  I walked in and was instantly greeted by a staff member that seated me at one of the tables which had a number on it.  I assume it's for waiting purposes.
I asked for a tea, and was surprised when I got a green tea.  it was very tasty though, so no complaints there. After about ten minutes, my pho showed up, and it was decent.  The broth was a little bit less flavorful than I'm used to, however it was still tasty.  They offered a full list of usual Pho ingredients and the pricing was inexpensive.  
I can say with certainty that I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed by this restaurant at all. We just moved to the area and this Pho restaurant just did not compare to others we've been to in town. The spring rolls lacked flavor, had no mint or cilantro and the pork tasted funny. The peanut sauce was also watered down which I have never seen! The egg rolls must have used the same pork because they tasted so gross and we ordered 5. We could not eat even one. The only reason I give them 2 stars is for their pineapple smoothie...it is amazing!! My family and I will never eat there again!!"}
{"text":"All I've had is the Pho but it is very good and inexpensive. Service is good too but they do skimp a little on the basil and other goodies for your Pho. They bring more if you ask. Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays which is just inconvenient for me because I always have to be next door for my daughter's music lessons on Mondays. If they were open, we'd eat there more I am sure."}
{"text":"The pho was fantastic and so fresh.  Clean and fast.  Will return agailn."}
{"text":"One of my favorites to go to for lunch when I am craving a good pho. I get the rare steak and it's really good portion size and the bone broth is delicious. My S/O almost always gets the pork chop and shrimp combo and he is always satisfied with it. Clean place, nice & friendly staff, on-time food service and just overall a good place to get some of your favorite Viet specialties if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to the North side of town, we were looking forward to trying out this place and making it \"our spot\". We were very weary about it because we loved our original spot, Pho Thanh on 17th ave and Camelback. But this place blew us away. It's a little family owned joint and they are absolutely the nicest people. It may be another dollar are two, but I feel like the experience is worth it. It sounds weird but the pho tastes \"cleaner\" and \"fresher\". It's like to cook it fresh every few hours or something to keep it tasting great! Service is also quick and top notch."}
{"text":"pho is good especially the beef they use. 
If you like traditional spring roll, you may not like it here. they put a lot of lettuce in the spring roll."}
{"text":"Not recommend.
Every dish has significantly less meat, less noodle, mostly only soup; egg rolls are not tasty. Had no quail egg at all in one dish. Overall experience is subpar. Attitude was not good."}
{"text":"The first thing I think of when someone tells me there's a Vietnamese restaurant I think hmmm, is the place going to be clean? since a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants around town are dives.  
To my surprise, this restaurant not only newly opened, is open, spacious, CLEAN and well decorated in a modern theme.  
The menu is extensive with the basic pho choice of rice noodles or egg noodles.  I decided to try their shrimp paste, pork chop, Vietnamese meat loaf over rice plate and a drink consisting of condensed milk, raw egg, and club soda.  
I was a bit queasy to try the drink but wanted something different~ as it turned out, the drink is tasty~ a bit like liquid custard.  I think it would taste even better with a bit of salt sprinkled in to enhance the flavor.  I have to laugh though since none of the other wait staff, including the owner has tried this drink even though it's on the menu!
The rice plate was good.  Everything tasty.  Only bit of turn off was the pork chop came out really greasy.  Had a layer of oil on both sides that I had to sop off with a couple of napkins.
The wait staff were friendly, so friendly in fact that they waved and hollered out good bye to me without giving me the check.  Lol.  Good thing I'm a honest customer and told them I had not paid yet!  
Overall, a very enjoyable experience.  Good location~ I hope they do well!!!"}
{"text":"the food is terrific!  maggie waited on us and she is just adorable and friendly.  we've tried a few other pho places around town and this is the best, our new placw for pho"}
{"text":"Really liked this place a lot. The food was fresh and delicious and the prices are very reasonable. 

The pho was great. Well seasoned broth. Lots of noodles. 

The combo fried rice plate was awesome. We added a little hoisin and chile sauce to kick it up a notch, but it had a really great flavor and we liked all the meats that were in it. 

The Saigon crepe (#6) was an awesome appetizer. It is filled with pork, shrimp and sprouts....and comes with s great little dipping sauce. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had been coming to Pho Viet since the days when they first opened. I would tell people about how wonderful the food was and how great the customer service would be. That changed tonight. I came home from work and thought it would be nice to go out and eat with a buddy at one of our favorite restaurants  after a hard days at work but was denied. The restaurant closes at 09:00 pm. We arrived at 08:30 and were told they were not serving. Yet there were people eating inside. Confused, my buddy and I look at each other and said I thought they closed at 09:00. Then they said they're only doing take out. But the restaurant says OPEN till 09:00! 
I know 08:30 is close the closing time but it not like we arrived 10 minutes before closing. We felt unwanted so we figured, well if they dont want our business....
My thoughts are, if ya want to close early, then change your time. 
Customers can forgive things but they will never forget how they were made to feel.

It was ok though because Ahso Sushi welcomed us with open arms so I guess I can thank Pho Viet for that at least."}
{"text":"Both the food and service were very good. Clean. They have the funniest shirts for sale!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here four times in the past three weeks! We can't get enough of it. I'm super picky about restaurants after working in the industry but this place is always clean, the staff is awesome, great service, and fresh food. We refuse to go anywhere else for pho now. Also, their shirts have great puns which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Awesome pho can't remember the number but its the one with everything in it!  And the people running the place are awesome will be back for sho!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars

this joint has one of the better tasting pho's in the Glendale area imo. The owners and staff are friendly, and they have clever ass shirts/hats for sale.

pho:  good broth that is sweet, salty, umami-ish, overall yummy.
bun bo hue: not spicy enough and sorta lacking flavor
bun thit nuong: hit or miss; sometimes it's super fresh and bomb, sometimes you can tell the noodles are day old/stale
eggrolls: always good
fried tofu appetizer: overall sorta plain, better if you dip it in their sweet/sour sauce"}
{"text":"I have probably eaten here close to 100 times.  Is it the amazing food? Sure, that's part of it. The secret sauce is actually the owners and their family. They treat you like you are part of the family. Pete remembers what I order each time I eat there no matter how long it has been since I've ordered it. Each meal is prepared with love and served with a smile. I cannot recommend Pho Viet enough. I wish more companies treated their customers like Pho Viet does."}
{"text":"was okay ... not great nor spectacular. broth had no essence to it, didn't taste fresh"}
{"text":"They have awesome Pho Thai here at very reasonable prices. The thin slices of beef aren't fatty either! The staff is very friendly every time I come here as well. If you are in the mood for Pho Thai, I'd definitely recommend this place. One of the best I've found in the valley so far."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place quite often for Pho. They have the most wonderful service and their food is absolutely outstanding!!! I cannot say enough to good things about this place. But if you haven't been here I highly recommend it! Two thumbs up that's for sure!"}
{"text":"If you need an introduction to Pho (like me) this is the place to get it.  My reaction to the first mouthful was 'tasty!'.  Not being a Pho connoisseur, I can't judge it against other restaurants, and I haven't tried anything else on the menu,  But the Pho is delicious and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I am new to the valley and i must admit.. pho viet knows how to make the best pho i have ever had! The broth is so savory and you can tell they put a lot of love into it. On top of that.. The wait stsff are great.. There are two cute girls always working"}
{"text":"Really considerate and friendly servers/family and a vast menu that never leaves me bored or wanting more. Plus, you can get a bowl of their Pho, a Spring Roll/or Egg roll, and a drink for $10 which is more than enough for one person. This restaurant reminds me of home in Orange County and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high reviews that this place got.  It was very disappointing experience for us.  The spring roll was dry and stale.  The peanut sauce lacked flavor.  And the pho was nasty.  It seems that the broth is made from the broth cubes that you can buy at grocery stores.  Maybe for Phoenix standard that this is good, but no, it's not."}
{"text":"The people that own this place are some of the nicest people I've met in this town. The food was incredible too; especially the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I got the 10$ pho combo. Pho, spring roll, and drink. Not a bad deal. 

Spring roll was off. Iceberg lettuce and cucumbers made this taste strange and unfamiliar. 

Pho was plain. Usually I don't mind spicing it up but this was so bland nothing helped it. Meat was already cooked by the time I got it (and considering I ordered the rare meat...). 

My friend ordered pad thai with chicken only (so no beef or shrimp) but got both in her dish. They never asked her what spice level she wanted either. 

Service was fine. Food was delivered quickly and water was filled as needed. Bathroom and location was clean as well. 

Overall, I've had much better pho for cheaper. Would not really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best pho on the west side.   Recently moved from east valley 8 months ago and was difficult to find a good pho place until I found this... great broth (always consistent with taste),  good service and one of the few places you can find traditional ox tail.  A+ & top Westside place so far!!"}
{"text":"I have returned to Yelp after a hiatus to leave a review because this place is so amazing! The staff treats me and my husband and 2 year old like family. The food is delicious. I had not had pho until I tried this place, and we have returned almost weekly for several months. The special is great: pho, spring rolls, and a soda for $10! We love coming here, and we have returned with friends and family. Run, don't walk, for outstanding food and friendly service."}
{"text":"As soon as I figure out exactly what #56 on the extensive menu was beyond \"chicken, rice, and crispy pickled vegetables\" I'll tell you - but I can tell you now the name doesn't do it justice.  The food was delicious and in decent but not overwhelming quantity.   Service was attentive, solicitous, and friendly, and the dining area well-spaced, clean and appealing with a few well-placed nods to the orient, but not overdone, down to the low-key Viet pop music in the background.  And the price for this lovely plate of food in this very pleasant, friendly, family-run eatery: an amazing $7.99.   

  I have to mention the red rice that came with the meal. Expecting only the ordinary white sticky rice, this was a surprise, and a most pleasant one.  It was moist, reddish-orange in color, and full of satisfying flavor of it's own sufficient that we asked the staff what was in it.  We never got a definitive answer but whatever it is/was - it was not the traditional pile of tasteless stuck together white rice one might expect, and especially at so modest a price for so good a meal.  

As stated above, the dining room is clean and attractive and the tables well-spaced, un-crowded.  Service could not have been friendlier or more attentive, though the attention lavished on us may have partly been a factor of our being the only customers at the odd dining time of 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  

I don't know Vietnamese food very well at all, but I know what I like and Pho Viet did a wonderful job of providing it this afternoon.  I will be back to try more of the very affordable menu and enjoy the good service as well."}
{"text":"They have a huge variety of pho. The food is delicious and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"By far the best pho in town! Oxtail pho... Not on the regular menu. The owner is a young handsome chef with major skills in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Brought the whole family here, everyone likes whatever they got. For me , there is only thing I don't like about my pho, the soup was a little bit too salty for me. Other than that, was all good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We're pretty picky about our pho, and this place is a winner every time! Service is excellent, the pho is aromatic and flavorful, and my son loves the boba drinks"}
{"text":"I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood décor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, \"We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink.\" Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, \"I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro.\"

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pho places in Arizona. The food and service is fantastic. Every worker is very friendly. They have a wonderful staff. Thank you Peter for being an amazing server! Will come back in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonably priced. I tried both the pho and a ban mi and was very impressed."}
{"text":"Finding decent Vietnamese restaurants outside of the East Valley is tough.  It becomes much tougher when you want one that's clean!  On a late Sunday evening, my family was hungry and we all wanted pho.  The previous place we went to was quickly ticked off the list due to their inability to get food out to us in less than one hour.  I found Pho Viet via Google maps - sorry Yelp.  But my first search criteria was vicinity to my parents house.  I called to ask what time they closed and was pleasantly surprised that not only they were still open, but that they even told us that they would be serving their last order at 8:30 pm.  That was important because it gave us a time-box.  In that scenario, most VN will just hope you come by a certain time and if you don't, they won't serve you, ergo a wasted trip.  But Pho Viet was clear on that, so I appreciated the heads up.

We arrived with a party of 14 people.  A man (I'm assuming the owner) came out to greet us and welcomed us - incredibly rare for a VN restaurant!!  He then asked if any of us lived near Van Nuys.  It happened to be my work mobile number.  He recalled the 818 number showing up on his phone and noted he had family there.  It was a welcome \"small talk\" chat.

However, the head waitress came off quite rude.  As we were still looking through our menu, she came by with a very loud voice asking, \"An cai gi?!\"  For Vietnamese, saying that in a specific tone and volume, it's rude.  i'm not sure what the closest English equivalent would be, because the literal translation doesn't sound that bad. But it's annoying.  However, after a stern, \"what did you ask?\" from my dad, she quickly realized her error and quickly corrected it.  Apologized and was great thereafter.

OK, now for the food.  It's a solid \"B\" from this Yelper.  It seemed like this was the general consensus from our table.  Good solid food that fed us all well after a very long day.  I ordered the seafood hu tieu.  When I got the order I was a bit disappointed that it was the opaque (\"hu tieu\" noodle) and not the glass noodle.  But that's on me - the other is the more traditional I guess.  Either way, the broth was quite good.  However, the seafood was lacking - they were very skimpy on the actual seafood. No squid!  It wasn't a hearty meal as most other places.  A taste of my daughter's pho broth was also good!  Again, very light, if not missing entirely, on the traditional accompaniments typically found in most pho!

That said, it is very clean (new is my guess).  Despite that initial hiccup, the service was quick and friendly.  The food is solid and worth a return trip!  If they could \"beef up\" the ingredients in their soups, then they would be much better!"}
{"text":"Great new Pho place, have been here twice now, service was good food was delicious had the chicken Pho and chow fun both were very fresh and tasty with large portion size. We will be back to try more.."}
{"text":"Love this pho place, very yummy for pho, egg rolls, and great, fast service!  I've had other dishes as well too and they are consistently good and authentic!"}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp while looking for boba smoothies,great choice.had spring rolls,grilled pork sandwhich and smoothies.everything was very good,can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find restaurants that remind me of home but Pho Viet has done it.  By far the best place for pho in Phoenix.  Amazing food!!! Family owned so you know the service is on point!!!  If you're craving for some good pho 'pho'get about the other places this is the place to satisfy your craving"}
{"text":"Went there this weekend for the first time. The thought of soup on a warm, 120 degree day did not sound like a great idea, so we opted for rolls and a noodle dish. I am brand new to Vietnamese food, so the menu was pretty intimidating to a newbie. However, Maggie and Peter did a GREAT job explaining things to us while keeping our waters filled! Very friendly, VERY CLEAN, food was yummy. Please give this new restaurant a try and be sure to introduce yourself to Maggie and Peter..Super nice folks. I wish them luck!! Welcome to AZ."}
{"text":"The vegan pho lacked the flavor I was looking for, but had a ton of veggies and tofu that made up for that. The tofu vermicelli bowl also had a good amount of tofu, and noodles. The portions are quite large. The dressing for the bowl smelled like it had fish sauce, so I didn't use it and just used lime. The peanut sauce here was kinda on the runny side."}
{"text":"I always get the Pho with everything in it. I have never had a bad experience with the food or service. Everyone is very nice and very attentive. The atmosphere is very clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Small establishment with great service and excellent pho soup, definitely a must try if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is Pho-King great !! If you love and live for pho like I do then you must give this place a try ! Fast seating , fast friendly service , fresh ingredients, clean atmosphere .. The pho was so delicious I wanted to go back for dinner !  I got the dine in special , for 10$ you get a bowl of pho , plate of ingredients to throw in , spring roll or egg roll and a soda .. Now that's a great deal ! I will be back , probably in a couple days haha !"}
{"text":"I love the options they had here, they don't skimp you on noodles or meat. I got one of the special pho's and it was amazing. I kept pulling out different meats all the time. I am really glad there is a pho place like this around me and I don't have to travel down to tempe/mesa anymore. 

Sandwich is good, the bread to toppings ratio could be better (less bread would be good).  Didn't try and spring rolls when i was there, next time i will.

Also they have hilarious shirts."}
{"text":"I admit I'm spoiled from the shaken beef I order at Saigon Kitchen in Surprise which is A+, but the Grilled beef, marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot and garlic over it #78 which reads as if it would be superb....well, it just wasn't.  Overcooked and had the consistency of tough 2 day old beef, not fresh tasting at all...very disappointing.  You get a couple slices of tomato and cukes and some steamed rice patty with it, but I would never order this again there.  
However, it was a cold day, the place was packed and everyone--and I mean everyone--was eating a form of their many varieties of pho.  So, I will give this place one more try and get the pho next time.  
Maybe I ordered the wrong thing here (in which case, please take it off the menu), but it seems to be strictly a pho place...so pho next time it shall be.  It's cold out, so I'm sure I'll enjoy it...or hope I will.
Their smoothie (I got the mocha cappaccino) is basically frozen ground ice with some liquid over it.  Not bad but no big deal.
Not a big fan of their fresh spring rolls.  Not bad just nothing special.
However, the food here is super cheap compared to other Vietnamese restaurants which seems to be a huge draw for most.
As an asidum, the male who owns the place is very friendly and tries to make everyone feel very welcome.  No complaints with service at all.
Oh, and the place is very clean and well decorated for what it is and the area it's in."}
{"text":"Unlike pizzerias or burger joints, I've never been comfortable reviewing Vietnamese restaurants. I blame this primarily on their menus always consisting of over one hundred different entrées (literally!) that all essentially read/sound exactly the same. If you don't have someone pointing you in the right direction, I'd compare it trying to decipher a medical bill. Lots of Xs, lots of accents over letters, and wait - is that even a real word? I suggest disregarding the menu. Just look at the Yelp pictures and make a decision.

I usually get a fried rice entree with a combination of meats (sans shrimp) or a plate of grilled beef with rice, while upgrading to a fried egg. My girlfriend usually gets a similar-styled dish, only with chicken instead of beef. Everything we've ever had offers up very good flavor and quality for the price you pay. Although you wouldn't expect it, their Thai Tea (with boba) is significantly better than some legitimate Thai restaurants we've visited in the city.

They're big on their word-play t-shirts/slogans - which is now mandatory at all Pho-based restaurants.  

Service wise, they can be somewhat slow - especially if they're busy. If you need your check, you're better off just going up front and requesting it. I suggest not waiting around for anyone to come check on you. They also have a tendency to neglect cleaning tables of finished parties when they're not busy. We've walked in on Sunday afternoons before to find four or five tables littered with leftovers. They're in no rush to clean them either. It just looks kind of gross, but I try to overlook these shortcomings since the food here is very good.

Despite the minor complaints, we've never had a bad meal here despite repeated visits. For that, I give them a solid recommendation!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pho here! Very fresh and what you come to expect from a Pho spot. One downside would be there is no beer or alcohol and it can be busy with some slower service."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, clean, good settings. Broth is goood, good portions and price is about average, customer service is good. Nice selection in the menu..id come bak."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful and the service is just as good. I highly recommend Pho Viet to anyone in the area! Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese Restaurant north of Camelback in Arizona.  It's better than Pho Avina, Angelina's, Viet Kitchen and Pholicious.  The have a wide variety of items to choose from that you would only find in Southern California.  It may seem pricey, but it's comparable to other Vietnamese Restaurants in the area and they do give you a good amount of food.  Everything tastes fresh, looks good, and smoothies are creamy (avocado=yum)!  Orders were taken quickly and accurately.  It's a new place and I do enjoy the cleanliness, decors and their authentic Vietnamese music."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho I have ever had. You are greeted almost instantly with ice water and receive your entree in a timely manner. There is something about the broth that makes it different than the rest. And I mean that in the best way possible. Thank you for always providing my family and I with great costumer service and food."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, had the pho ga and it was tasty. Next time will try the pho kong with beef broth. Clean inside, seemed to be a newer establishment. Prices were reasonable- I paid $7.45 for the pho ga. Service was good- this is not counter service, you order from a server. Sodas are sold by the can, not fountain drinks- kind of weird."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona. Shout out to Peter and Maggie for the great service! The food is amazing, i will be coming back PHOsure!"}
{"text":"I was nearby the first time I went and decided to stop in after seeing the Yelp reviews. The restaurant was clean and staff was friendly. I've ordered a different Pho each time and have been amazed at the quality. The broth is incredible. The spring rolls are also amazing. The prices are very reasonable. This is the best Pho I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bowl in the valley. It's a trek for me now, but when I used to live in Glendale I LOVED to frequent this place. My son doesn't particularly like pho but he would eat here. It's super consistent if you like to order the same thing. The options for pho are varying and amazing, if you like trying something new all the time. I love the family owned and operated style business. Everyone here is friendly and very helpful if you are being indecisive. Unlike some other Vietnamese places I visit, this restaurant is always clean and brightly lit! The fixings are always fresh to def. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said about this restaurant. I have some friends that are Vegetarian and they love the veggie bowl. That sounds like a good deal to me :)"}
{"text":"I have my favorite to go Pho place but since it was Sunday and they were closed, i looked elsewhere. Thanks to yelp i found Pho Viet. While the reviews were great, i was less than satisfied. 
The beef broth was delicious, and they come in 2 sizes- regular or large. Portions were good, and garnishes were spot on. 
The customer service was a let down. This where the 3 stars come in. The service was distant and raw. For a first time customer, they surely left a bad first impression. 
My 2 year old who loves pho, accidentally knocked my sister's boba into her soup and since it was an accident, i thought their staff would be accomodating. But instead, they were going to charge me a whole 11 dollars more for giving her another child size portion. Pathetic! Needless to say, I don't think I'd return unless it was my absolute last resort."}
{"text":"I had been craving ramen for a while, but haven't found any good ramen places in Phoenix, so pho was the next best thing. After a Yelp search, we were in the area and decided to try Pho Viet. Man, we were not disappointed! But we didn't even have the pho! I had the egg noodle soup #41 and my hubby had the rice noodle ham hock soup #36. Both were delicious and filling. It was pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon so that was a good sign. Everything they brought out looked so good...I will definitely be back because I want to try one of everything on the menu. Peter introduced himself as I was paying the bill--nice owner and wait staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a staple for my family and I when it comes to eating Ph?. It's always very clean, friendly staff and great service! The food is excellent, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A definite favorite of mine! This is the first place I have ever tried pho and its so delicious and everything else I've tried here is very yummy too! All of the employees are very nice too! Cant say enough nice things about this place! :)"}
{"text":"Have gone back a few times since the first review, still a big favorite for us. 
Can't recommend their boba enough. Delicious flavors! They're thinking of doing boba cards as well, which would be very awesome.

Picked up some food to go for Father's Day yesterday, received food in a timely manner. Were given water and our drinks while they prepared it. 

Also they discounted the order for the holiday, very nice of them! :3"}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious food. There are so many options and the broth is delicious without adding anything else."}
{"text":"For a pho place, I think the serving was a bit on the small side for the price. I got an iced Boba tea as well and all the boba was clumped together so that was pretty lackluster as well. Food isn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. 

Updated: Felt like I got hit by an MSG truck later that night and so did my gf. Updated review. Wouldn't come here again or recommend."}
{"text":"Craving pho, like usual, and decided to hit up a new spot.

Atmosphere:
-open, lots of space
-clean
-not \"packed\" for lunch, but certainly had business (a good thing)
-TVs with college football on

Location:
-strip mall restaurant
-relatively easy to find
-lots of parking

Food:
-ordered the rare beef pho. Was moderately impressed, but not the best I've ever had (Miss Saigon, Tucson). Seemed a little bland comparatively.
-side garnish for pho: mine was fresh (I double-checked). Standard basil, bean sprouts, jalepenos and lime. The cilantro was already in the bowl. 
-also ordered Thai Tea with boba. Was not very impressed... there was A LOT of ice and I ended up leaving most of the boba at the bottom of the glass as all of the liquid was gone in a few sips.

Service:
-quick, efficient, polite
-price, as expected ~$10 before tip for pho and tea

A good meal, I will likely be back if in the area."}
{"text":"Service is great, polite and quick for to go orders, dined in 1x, same great service and positive attitude!  
I get the Pho, either chicken or tofu depending on my mood and both are very good.
Love that they are in North Phoenix, seems like there is slim pickings around here for decent ethnic foods so yay!"}
{"text":"Very good pho. Large portions and easily made into a to go order! I will definitely go here again. I've been looking for a great authentic pho place that is close to me and I think this is it"}
{"text":"What an amzing find in our new neighborhood!! Service was great and helpful, food was fabulous. Everyone was very friendly. Quick, delicious, affordable and clean, what a combination! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Place was really modern and clean. The food is tasty and i come here everytime im craving pho. I gave this place a 4 because the take out boxes leak and its a complete mess to heat up/prepare everything at home. Great place for dine in though. The staff could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"I had the Hu Tieu and the Grilled Pork Banh Mi. Both were very good.  I wish that there were a little more protein on the dish when I first saw it, but after I finished my meal I was very satisfied.  They have lots of traditional Vietnamese options like Banh Xeo which I wish I could've tried. Service was good but not great (what you usually get at an Asian restaurant) and the food came out pretty quickly. Next time I'm in Phoenix and I need a Viet fix, I'm definitely going to come here again."}
{"text":"Really good food. I ordered soup and an a dinner entrée. The soup could have been dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for pho! Service is fast and the food is delicious. I also loooove their Thai tea: perfect balance of cream, tea, and sweetness! Food always tastes fresh, but doesn't take long to be served after placing an order. It gets pretty busy in the late evenings, but I haven't had to wait long for a table. I see customers constantly picking up phone orders, so that's a definite (positive) indicator on how popular this place is."}
{"text":"Visited the place on opening day.  The interior decorating is simple, easy on the eyes, nothing fancy but gives a clean look.  They have a full menu as what you'd expect in a Vietnamese family restaurant.   Prices are average, comparable to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.  Ordered a bowl of the special beef noodle soup (Pho Dac Biet); the service was fast and the server was helpful, friendly, and courteous, but the Pho is just a so-so taste.  The broth either has too much cinnamon or severely lacks anise and the sweetness of the beef bones, 2 of the main ingredients of a good Pho broth...  As the result, it tastes blandly pretty much like salt water with cinnamon...  The good thing is I don't taste the MSG in the soup either, so an added star on the healthy side :-)  Will definitely try other items on the menu next time."}
{"text":"My first 5 star review!

This place has the best pho I've ever had. Not best in AZ, best ever!  along with Really big vietnamese portions. totally legit if you ask me 

the staff is fast and efficient which is  what i look for in a restaurant  we ordered spring rolls and everyone got pho. however the vietnamese iced coffee was something newer that was introduces to me here it too was delicious. this was our first time  at (Pho Viet Vietnamese Restaurant) because it's a newer family establishment that just opened last week but i have a feeling the owners and staff-will be seeing me as a regular just for pho. did i also mention its authentic and cheap in price! which calls for perfect lunch with friends and family  on any given day.

the best part of my experience is the owners checked to see how everything was which never really happens in most family restaurants that ive been to...

keep up the great service !!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife tonight for dinner. The large bowl of beef,veggies,noodles,and beef broth. It was very good and filling had plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. The wife had the grill combo plate with beef, pork and chicken, and she really liked it.
Server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so pleasant and the food is delicious not to mention cleanliness and great customer service . I'll definitely be coming back and make it my place for pho  deli. Also if you like rare steak like I do. Ask for the steak on the side! So it doesn't cook fully while in broth !"}

{"text":"Pho #41 on the menu is the Bomb with wontons, sliced pork, shrimp and fish balls! Lychee tea was de-lish also! Too cold tonight for the avocado smoothie but next time that's a must! Great food- fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Excellent Spring Rolls and Excellent Pho.  I had the Pho with little bits of everything.  They had Soda Chanh as well.  Got some Viet Iced Coffee to go and enjoyed every last drop.  
Spring rolls were very delicious, their peanut sauce needed a little hoisen added as it wasn't as good as most places, not saying it was bad, but I have had better.  

The pho broth was very good, they didn't have jalapenos to add to my soup, but it was not a problem.  The meat was tender, maybe a little lacking, I would have preferred more meat, maybe next time I will ask for extra meat.

Bonus note, they take AMEX!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. The staff were very quick to assist me and they were prompt with my order of beef pho and spring rolls. I've had better spring rolls but the pho was excellent. The small bowl was plenty of food for me.

One of their staff was playing a game of chess with a regular patron who is a local business owner. I thought that was very cool that they take the time to build relationships with regular customers and really get to know their neighbors. 

I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"There are many reasons why I love Pho Viet. The menu is filled options for the adventurous or for the lovers of staple vietnamese food. For an appetizer, I highly suggest the #2 or spring roll with pork and shrimp. Delicious! I also highly suggest the #14 or the pho with rare beef and meatball. I am always skeptical towards the quality of meat for pho restaurants, this place has always had the highest quality in Phoenix.  I suggest that you put a good amount of lime into the pho because that makes all the difference. If you aren't into pho, then get the DELICIOUS fried rice. Its not greasy, rather its well seasoned and has some seriously delectable meats. The vietnamese coffee with the filter that brews at your table is delicious with the condensed milk. The tables are always clean and the wait staff is attentive. The boba is delicious, especially the taro or coconut flavor. Every friday or saturday night, a group of nine or ten friends of mine stop by Pho Viet, because the food and service is guaranteed success. 

FOOD QUALITY: 10/10
SERVICE: 10/10
FOOD TASTE: 11/10"}
{"text":"A great little cafe to eat delicious and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. My family loves going to this restaurant! The spring rolls are so yummy. I definitely recommend those. All of the main dishes I have tried are incredible. Their specialty drinks are also very well prepared. I would definitely try the smoothies with boba. Great and refreshing for a hot Arizona day. I recommend you try it out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"14- pho tai, bo vien\" added chicken and shrimp, large size. The broth was flavorful. Counted 3 shrimps and 4 very thin slices of rare flank steak, lots of dry not seasoned chicken , even the beef meatballs were tasteless. For the large bowl you don't get any extra steak or meatballs just more broth and noodles. The noodles tasted stale."}
{"text":"We never leave this place disappointed! Came in last night and I wish I could remember the names of everything we ordered but we had two rolls as an appetizer, not fried, with shrimp and pork and they were amazing! The dipping sauce was so good. I ordered the meatball soup that doesn't come with noodles and added veggies cause I'm trying to lay off the carbs and honestly it was perfect. Very filling. Boyfriend ordered the pho ga, his favorite and was pleased as usual. This is the only place we go to for pho."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place by my house. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"If you're into trying new foods . This is a great place , the beef soup is the best. I went 6/7 days in a row last week . Even the owner would recognize us and come shake our hands because he was happy to see us come so often. Green apple boba is also very good."}
{"text":"really good pho!!! One of the best ive had, really dont care for the fried eggrolls though ive had better!"}
{"text":"Really great pho, really delicious vermicelli!  The servers and staff were friendly and energetic for their new business, and I wish them luck!

I came here because at 8 pm on a Monday night, every pho place around was closed or getting ready to close.  This place is open 7 days a week, and later than most other joints.  This makes it a lot easier on me to get pho with my unusual schedule."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 ...and that's being generous.

My husband and I went here for lunch today. It was really busy. We have been here before a few years ago, but we couldn't remember the quality of food. 

Well, I wanted to really like this place... but I just couldn't. The people/owners seem nice.
But the food was mediocre at best. It's authentic but not good-authentic. It's bad-authentic.
I bought the \"Com Tom dish (broken rice, grilled pork, shredded pork/skin, shrimp paste, and something else)\" for $8.99. My husband bought the \"Bun Bo hue.\"

First off, it is overpriced. My rice dish doesn't come with the typical fried egg or the side of broth. If you want to add the fried egg, it's an additional 75 cents. Secondly, the grilled pork is dry (almost like jerky) and the rice was very dry (reminded me of day-old rice that you are trying to reheat in the microwave). AND the rice is not the typical 'broken rice.' The dish did not satisfy my hunger level nor my satisfaction level. I'm a small person, and this couldn't get me full.

My husband's \"Bun Bo Hue\" was EXTREMELY spicy and lacks the 'bun bo hue' flavor. I love \"Bun Bo Hue\" but NOT here... definitely not here. I would not get that again and neither would he.

I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the combination pho and egg rolls. The pho was delicious. The broth was just right. I was also excited to see that they served macaron ice cream. I ordered the green tea flavor. The macaron ice cream looked beautiful but when I took my first bite, the macaron was VERY hard. It was disappointing. The macaron didn't have any special flavor to it either. The green tea ice cream, though, was good enough. If they had separated the macaron from the ice cream before serving them, I think it would come out much better. Overall, I will come back for their pho but I probably won't order the ice cream."}
{"text":"This is my very first review and I could not be more excited about writing it for Pho Viet! I was in town visiting a friend and we decided to stop in based on all of the yelp reviews and what a great decision it was! The service was awesome.  Every thing was done in a timely manner and the staff was so friendly!

As a vegetarian, I'm always on the look out for dishes that really transform tofu. The lemongrass tofu was SO good!  Not only was it a beautiful dish, but the tofu was perfectly firm and not too mushy (which I hate). If I lived in Arizona I would eat here a couple of times a week!"}
{"text":"Pho Viet is a family favorite. My kids and I have enjoyed many of their dishes, especially the soups. The staff is super friendly and always have a smile. They remember what we ordered and want every time we visit. Friendly place, great food!"}
{"text":"Went there today, and will definitely be back. I had Goi Cuon Ga Nuong (grilled chicken spring roll) for an appetizer, and Pho Ga (chicken pho). Mmmm. Very good! I had a Thai tea boba on my way out. Quick and friendly service! The menu is huge; you will definitely find something you like here."}
{"text":"This is the closest Pho restaurant near my school so I go here quite often during lunch hour. But that's NOT to say that the food is good. I've tried many different types of soup noodles here and one thing they all have in common is that the soup can be a bit salty. It tasted as if Pho Viet uses the same broth for a lot of their soup menus and therefore, for order such as the Hu Tieu where the meat/seafood is marinated, the soup becomes extra salty as compared to pho where there's no marinated meat so the soup comes out okay. 
For the Hu Tieu, it was salty up to the point where I had to a lot poor iced water into the soup in order to eat it. Very disappointing. 

As for the Bun Bo Hue, the meat they use looks pretty cheap. Almost half of the meat is fat. 

Customer service-wise, they have some friendly people."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Usher ft. Monica - Slow Jam)

I was all alone
I was feeling for some Pho
I needed something to cure my hunger up
So I dropped in on for lunch
Just to take a chance
And there this lovely place
Pho was just for 10 bucks!

I asked her for eggrolls
She said would I like a coke
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly served my meal
And I ate and fell in love
Only at  Pho Viet
Ohhh

Serve me a bowl of Pho
This time make it sweet
Only at Pho Viet

I like this place!  I love the combo here!  Yeah combo Pho meals here for lunch.

Pho Viet is definitely a small mom & pop ran restaurant.  I came on a whim to try and needless to say I wasn't disappointed.  I went for the Combo which came with a bowl of Pho, eggroll, and a soda.  The eggroll tasted homemade and with a perfect crunch along with mint leaves and a lettuce wrap; making this appetizer delightful.  The Pho itself was darn good and just what you'd expect.  Some people would complain about the portion size of the combo, but serious you probably need to eat less anyways....seriously!  

The place overall was spacious and well decorated with a couple of HDTV screens.  Service was overall attentive and on the ball about everything so all in all a great experience! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A good restaurant to try Vietnamese food. Clean place and friendly staff.  Vegetarians have very few options but fried rice and mango smoothie with Boba i tried were great ! Recommends for a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ordered to go meal and it was ready in 10 minutes. The guys at the front counter are super nice and helpful. Looking forward to coming here more often since it's so close to the office! I got the beef pho, the meat comes in a bag(raw) but the broth is like lave so it cooks fast. The veggies are plentiful and fresh. Also their coconut boba smoothie is delicious"}
{"text":"I went in to get some pho. The first time I went in I have to admit, I was not very happy. But I decided to go back. This time it was much better. The staff seemed different.  The food was very good. The portion was large. I had the chicken pho and thai iced tea. It is in a great location as well..."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Pho, this was my 2nd visit and I can say with confidence you won't be disappointed. The place is very clean and the wait staff is awesome."}
{"text":"The lunch special is an amazing deal! Service is always quick and friendly, and they make recommendations based on what you're in the mood for. I've had the Phó, chicken wings, and the bánh mì, they're always reasonably priced. I've been brought a few of the t-shirts!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a pho place near work and was not disappointed. Their broth is perfectly cooked and this is now our go to pho place. They have a variety of other foods choices as well that include rice dishes, vermicelli, and egg noodles. We have tried most of the menu and it is definitely delicious 

Our go to:

Pho Tai 
Charbroiled pork chop with broken rice 
Charbroiled pork with broke rice 
Charbroiled pork with vermicelli 
Eggrolls"}
{"text":"Pho Yummy!!

This is my new favorite spot for Pho!

Delicious...."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this restaurant and their pho. Hands down the best! If you want to try something new or just love pho.. you need to come here. It is a family owned restaurant, super clean, and everyone needs to try it!"}
{"text":"Really surprised to find such a clean location to devour the deliciousness that is Pho. Four girls came in just as it opened to get some nice broth into our systems after a night of dancing. The soup was so fresh and didn't make any of us feel greasy at all. Portions were just perfect and side vegetables were generously served as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went in with my BFF last week for our first visit .  We each ordered beef pho.  She had the number 13 Pho tai (?) and I had 12 I forget the name but was the beef pho with tripe tendon beef and meatball.  My friend is more the 'connoisseur' of pho.   Really tunes in to the broth flavors wherever we go.  Says if its more fishy or weak.  She said this was in her top 2 faves.   I basically just say if i like something or not and i did love it. she said it was a tie with Angelina's.  Pho Viet's  broth was so flavorful and even though it was 117 degrees outside, we just wanted to drink it!

 We also ordered their #8 appetizer crispy butter garlic wings.  The order came out to us quite Non-crispy and were actually raw in the middle.  The busboy took them from us right away apologizing and as we were waiting I believe it was the manager that came out to again apologize and ask if we wanted anything else while we waited for new wings.  (Very handsome BTW).  We didn't , and when our server brought the new wings they were incredibly delicious.  Nice and crispy , not sure what the spices/seasoning was but it was potentially addictive .  Taking a long shot guess but Asian 5-spice?  We will for sure be back for the wings and  venture around the menu!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the Yelp reviews. I wasn't impressed and won't return. :(

This review is based on my experience. If you had a great experience, well then lucky you!

Service was slow, served two other tables that arrived after us, never refilled my water and didn't clear the dirty dishes off the table. For a sit-down restaurant, I expect that or I would had just gone to a place where I can serve myself or some fast-food joint.

The food was ok. It was pricey for what you get for lunch. It was tasty, but not enough to lure me back again. 

Very clean place.

I like 43rd Express and Pho King Eggroll better."}
{"text":"Wow, so, I really like this place. It's not often that I see a Vietnamese restaurant have a lunch special. It's $10 and comes with a pho, a spring roll or summer roll, and a can of soda. How awesome is that?!

Also, I'm willing to drive a little further for good pho, and so I'm willing to drive to here, even though there's a closer pho place. I love how the pho taste here. It's flavorful and very good, and it's very filling as well. They have appropriate amount of serving of meat, and it's clean inside the restaurant. I love this place for pho, and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I came in an hour before closing tonight. Got spring rolls within 5 to 6 minutes after placing my order and my actual meal after an additional 5 minutes. This was the fastest and friendliest service I've received. Kept the water coming while my boba was being prepared for dessert which also didn't take very long at all. I've been to several pho restaurants before and this is one was the best I've had yet. I want to thank Peter for his recommendations and amazing food. I will definitely be coming back in the nearby future."}
{"text":"Huge establishment and conveniently close to where I live. I'm sorry-but not sorry for the following statement, but when you eat at a place that serves ethnic food and you don't see any people of that ethnicity there you know it's not legit/that good. I was probably the only Vietnamese person there, besides the staff, oh well!

It was too hot and muggy for Pho, so I got their Pork Chop Broken Rice Plate (Com Tam Suon), Avocado Shake with Boba and a Vietnamese sandwich to- go for breakfast the following day. The rice plate was incredibly small in portion. It came with a cup of rice, a thin piece of pork chop, a super small egg meatloaf (single-bite size), a fish patty (two-bite) and dipping sauce. The pork chop was bland in flavor and was greasy. The plate didn't even come with a bowl of broth and I didn't even get a knife (though I didn't need one cause the pork chop was so thin). The rice wasn't even broken, it was regular white rice. I was also still hungry upon finishing my meal. What?

The Vietnamese Sandwich I ate later was lacking, but eatable. The only good thing out of this meal was the Avocado Shake. Subpar Viet food and expensive. If you want good broken rice plates go to Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa, at least the advertised rice plates are the real deal, the rice is actually broken rice and you actually get to leave not hungry.

The service is okay especially with only 1-2 servers for a huge restaurant, they did forget my knife and forgot about my to-go order. However, the location is pretty clean. The price does not reflect the quality and portion for what they serve. A plate of food ($8.99), smoothie($4.49) and sandwich($4.00) cost me about $19. 

This is Vietnamese street food that should be affordable. Will I return? Most likely not."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, super friendly staff. A great selection for both the non-adventurous and those looking for more authentic Vietnamese. I ordered the Beef Pho which had great flavor and super fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"This place has great Pho and was recommended to me by a few friends.  The food definitely lived up to our expectations.  They also have TV's in the restaurant playing sports...which was a nice thing if you want to watch a game and grab some great Pho."}
{"text":"Found this place when I moved out here. The broth is so flavorful. They hook you up with veggies. Only takes about 10 min if anything. Looking for a bomb pho place come here!!!!! Had to give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was still very good and service was slightly better.  Our server did not come back to check in with us after our initial order and we had to go to the counter to order more drinks.  The gentleman at the counter that took our drink order and payment was really delightful though (this was not our server).

After this second visit, I don't think I will return.  Pho Avina is a lot closer to my home and they have the same high quality food and better service.  If someone invited me out to here, I would ask them to reconsider going to Pho Avina since the distance between the two establishments isn't far at all."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that this is the first time I've ever had to write a bad review   Not because I've never been disappointed, but because it's never been THIS unsatisfying. I have no idea how this place has earned a 5 star rating. There is too many places in the valley to get decent to excellent pho (Pho Thanh being my fav!)
Bad service. Over staffed and loud employees. Completely soggy noodles. Looked completely unappetizing (yes, I eat with my eyes). The beef in my partner's bowl was 90% fat. The egg rolls were almost too soft...had the texture of raw ground meat. The worst part of all, is they are the most expensive pho restaurant I've ever been to. To end this on a positive note, the place did a good job of creating some good ambience and was very clean (all that staff has to do something to keep busy )
Hoping you had an off day, Pho Viet. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! This one blows Pho Avina out of the water. The service is great, the place is clean, and the food is wonderful. They have a great selection of Boba smoothies for a hot day.  The Pho broth had nice flavor and they don't skimp on noodles or meat. I am from the Sedona area and try to make a point to stop for Pho when I am in Phoenix since it isn't something I can find locally. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our first experience at Pho Viet today. For starters, our waitress was so friendly she made us immediately feel comfortable. We were both able to get the 10 dollar combo special, which comes with a bowl of Pho, a  spring roll or egg roll, and a drink. The spring rolls were so fresh, the best I've had anywhere. I ordered number 31, Pho Ga, which is Pho soup with tender chicken. The broth was so tasty, seasoned perfectly. My husband got number 30 Pho Tom, PHO soup with premium shrimp. It had so many pieces of actual shrimp, we were both so surprised! 
We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here because they have vegetarian Pho soup. However it was very bland and tasted like they used hot water instead of broth. 
They were very nice here and it was clean and good prices.
They also seemed somewhat unaware when I brought up some allergies I have(nuts, soy, shellfish, all deadly allergies), I got blank stares in response. 
So, I won't be going back, I need flavor in my soup, not hot water and noodles and veggies, and it would be nice to know that my allergies are at least understood and going to be communicated to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Really delicious! Not the best I've had, but it was up there. The vermicelli noodles were good, spring roll was tasty, but hands down I think my favorite part was the Taro Boba smoothie we got for dessert. I've never had Taro before but dang, I definitely will again. Got it on the waitresses recommendation, and I'm happy we got it! 

Nice atmosphere, kind staff, overall i give it thumbs up:)"}
{"text":"They have now updated the menu to reflect pricing and the place continues to be my favorite Pho shop. I come here at least 1x/week. Love love this place"}
{"text":"Nothing special... They have a friendly staff, the resto is big but servings was just ok. Most of the time whenever we are eating Pho, we can only finish 3/4 of it but with this one, we had that feeling that we want more... Meaning serving was not enough or it was kinda short compared to the other Pho that we had. And we did ordered large ones. Even the kid size was too small for the prize, add 2-3 dollars more and you get the big bowl. The veggies (bean sprouts, leaves, lime etc) that was given to us doesn't look very frest, the ends was getting dark already."}
{"text":"I came in here after a hike and wanted to replenish myself with some noodles. After sitting down at a table, we receive iced waters. I personally don't like having my water with ice or being chilled, since it ruins the digestive system. I never drank it.
When I ordered and received my bowl, it was quite small. The price doesn't match the size, I would pay $5-6 for this instead of $7. The amount of noodle, brisket, and tendons was good, but I still felt hungry.

I also ordered strawberry iced tea; it was very good, but I would recommend pricing it at $2-2.50. That range seems more reasonable, since it is artificial flavoring. 

I would come back if the prices dropped to accommodate the portions they are giving out."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Always greeted with a smile-everyone is genuine & kind. We always look forward to going to Pho Viet."}
{"text":"Their soup is delicious. Delightful family runs this restaurant. Excellent food. We all ordered different things and they were all good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's a mom & pop joint. The food is good. I would eat there again. I'm just spoiled by my other place!!! So my Pho expectations are high."}
{"text":"This pakce is unassuming, friendly and budget friendly. I eat here once each week. Its the.only place neaf me to offer Vegan Pho. It is exceptionally delicious and chock full of veggies."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to pick for some Pho on the west side of Phoenix! Very quick and efficient as well as very reasonable prices. Everything I had was quite delicious and I will certainly be making another trip!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Love the pho and this place.  Best in N Phoenix!  Definitely worth going to.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This pho was just not my style, noodles were mushy big bowl isn't big, bowl temperature wasn't that hot, coffee was really good, would not try again"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and daughter interested in trying both a new place and a new food to us. We were not disappointed in the least.

We were immediately greeted and seated. Instead of the usual one server per area it seemed that the entire staff was willing and helping us throughout our meal.

The menu is vast and that creates a big problem.  The problem is that it is almost impossible to choose what you want. Everything looks great and actually arrives on your plate just as pictured.

I can't recall what exactly it is that we had but I can say that every bit of it was delicious.  The spring rolls are interesting as they are basically transparent from the use of rice paper.  Interesting in this case is a good thing. They were delectable.  

The wide variety of sauces available at the table complement each morsel nicely. I sat complement because they are basically not needed. They add to the overall mix of flavors but I wouldn't miss them if they weren't available. 

Cost is much better than I would expect.  The ability to call in orders and take out makes this place perfect if you prefer something different from the usual take out varieties. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Every time I'm craving vietnamese food, this is the first place I go to! I brought my cousin here when she was visiting from out of state. She was craving pho & is also a vegetarian. 

This place has an amazing vegetarian pho on their menu which she loved! She loved it so much that she ordered some for take out the day before she left! 

I ordered the grilled pork plate which was amazingly good. I also added the fried egg on top of my rice. Who doesn't love a fried egg over their rice?! The grilled pork had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. & I had an ice coffee which always hits the spot. 

I've also had their grilled pork chop rice plate. The pork chop was well seasoned. But I felt like the pro chop was really thin and wasn't worth the price you pay for it. Also, their seafood banh cuon soup really hit the spot for me. 

Service isn't the best here. My very first visit, my cousin and I waited for about 20 mins before the server came to check up on us. We were sitting there waiting for the check, not realizing that you have to go up to the counter to pay. When I ordered my ice coffee, I never got it until 5 mins after I finished my meal so I had to get it in a Togo cup. Also, this place is kinda stingy on their meat portions."}
{"text":"I came here to eat lunch. They served me my grilled pork and it was cooked raw. I asked the guy if he can grill it again and agrees to do so. Servers are nice. Guy who was working at the REGISTER  was extremely rude, he just took my card swiped it and didn't even make eye contact.what an ass. Happy New Years to you too! Don't come here if the people that run the place doesn't even ask you for your feed back. Left $5 tip on the table for the girl who served us."}
{"text":"Very good quality and excellent service. A friendly, family place that is very clean and has a great atmosphere. The food is tasty and they have great teas and desserts."}
{"text":"My boyfriends parents treated us to dinner here Saturday night. This was my first time  eating at a Vietnamese restaurant. While I looked over the menu I gawked at how many options there were! There are over 100 different combos to choose from. I ordered the # 74, Grilled shrimp, grilled chicken, shredded pork & pork skin, and Vietnamese meatloaf over steamed rice. My food was very tasty. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy what they ordered as well which ranged from Pho soups, to something with lemongrass, and these cute little coffees. They also had a few different sauces on the tables to choose from like hot, duck, sircha, etc. which were very good. I also discovered what boba slushies were! I had no idea these tasted so good. I am hooked. The servers were very nice and the atmosphere was very peaceful. I do plan on visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town! Super friendly staff and quick service. Great menu and selection at very reasonable prices!! And they have boba!"}
{"text":"I have found this place about 1 year ago and have been going to it since. It's near my place and the customer service has been superb to me. I have brought so many of friends and colleagues to this place to enjoy their great foods. Will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is excellent and the people are the best. You've got to try the avocado smoothie for desert. It is wonderful--I've tried making it myself, but I can't make it nearly as good."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Had a beef and  a chicken pho, both were good all fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time a couple weeks ago and I cannot stop thinking about how great the experience was. Service was great. Very friendly staff and they made ordering really easy. I never had Pho before and I really enjoyed it. Portion is perfect size for one person. The ingredients were very fresh. I know I will be coming back soon! 
The atmosphere also was great. I loved how clean it was inside."}
{"text":"Tried out this place today, as I  have been looking for something close to work.. I have a few places in Phoenix area that I trust but a lil too far. (Pho Viet Nam - Chandler // Da Vang - Phoenix // Phu Thanh - N Phoenix inside LeeLee) 

Pho Viet, after reviewing the posts. we gave it a shot.  please note:
_ Place VERY clean, tables chairs, floor etc - which shouldn't go much towards the #1 issue, the food.
_ Waiter/s - Polite and hospitable 
_ Menu - A lot of options, wheew weeee
_ Price - Average - please recognize fresh veggies in your dish, not frozen,, 

On to my review of the Food !!

# 47  - Mi Xao Don Thap Cam
(bird nest) Stir-fried crunchy egg noodle with beef, shrimp, chicken and vegetables.

Veggies, Fresh and al dente good job. 
Meats, well seasoned, (tad bit dry) Shrimp lil over cooked.
Noodles, great flavor and nice crunch, and awesome in the broth.
Broth , was very good, and worked great with the noodles. 
_________________________________________________________
coworker tried
#103 - Bun Tom, Thit Nuong, Cha Gio
Rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp, chicken, and egg roll served with lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, peanuts, and a side of lime chili fish sauce.

Coworker states,  Not the \"best\" ever, but definitely the best he's had in AZ

1st Time but not the Last... This place is pretty good, will be here more often and sample more dishes. Will update on the next round..

PS. Don't read into posters who only have minimal posts either haters, or don't really know food, as you should always post the good and the bad experiences for full circle of opinions and to judge the posters values. Users with only one post and being negative should be removed from yelp... just saying."}

{"text":"I found this restaurant after a brief Yelp search. My daughter and I were famished after a day of looking for a vehicle for her. We were up by Bell Road an the I17 after visiting a couple of local car dealerships. This was possibly the worst Pho restaurant we've encountered. We ordered 2 bowl of pho, a calamari appetizer, and I had a glass of iced tea. The tea had an off flavor, reminiscent of pepto bismol. Before I add condiments/garnishes to my soup, I always try the broth first. Not only was my broth sans accompaniment, it was sans flavor. The both tasted like they ran out and had to add water to the base. Not impressed to say the least. To top it off, our appetizer came AFTER the soup. The calamari was not impressive either, in fact the breading had a weird texture. I won't be coming back to this restaurant. Food quality is sub par. I'm willing to give a restaurant leeway on ambiance if the food surpasses my expectations. This restaurant was abysmal. I left completely unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Best pho we've found in Phoenix!  Just stinks that they don't serve beer."}
{"text":"Still the best pho in town. I could eat here everyday and not get sick of it. So many boba smoothie flavors and so many dishes beyond soup. Check it out if you haven't already and if you have head back :)"}

{"text":"3.5 Stars

I am tad under the weather so I thought that some soup for lunch would hit the spot.  I haven't had any pho in quite some time so I decided to come down here.  It's real close to work and the Yelp reviews were very good.  

I walked in and took a seat.  It took awhile for anyone to come over to take my order...they were busy though and one guy was basically doing everything.  Eventually he bought my water over and then an older gentleman took my order.  I ordered some Spring Rolls and a bowl of Pho with just noodles, no meat.  Here is how they were..............

Spring Rolls-  I had never had a spring roll before today...weird, I know.  These spring rolls were decent in size and came with a peanut dipping sauce.  Turns out, I thought they were just alright.  The paper of the rolls had a weird gummy texture and I just didn't care for it.  The stuff on the inside was plentiful.  Each one had about 3 shrimp in them and some pork too.  The peanut dipping sauce tasted fine.  If you love spring rolls, these may be fantastic for you...I just personally didn't like them that much and wouldn't get them again.

Pho-  Now this is what I'm talking about!  This was some of the best Pho I have ever had (Haven't had a whole lot of pho, but compared to the ones that I have had, this stuff was very good).  I added a little Sriracha sauce in my bowl and mixed it up and went to town.  It had plenty of noodles, a great tasting broth and the serving size was pretty large.  It was nice and hot and spicy.  It felt good on my sore throat and opened up my nasal passages fairly well.  I would definitely come back to get a bowl of this the next time I am feeling a little bit sick.

Total cost for everything including tip was $12.00.  Without the Spring Rolls, it would have been closer to $8.00.  Service was alright....not great, not horrible...just alright.  Ill be back for some more soup soon enough."}
{"text":"My first impression of the place is, it's visually clean and spacious with great interior decor. The service was quite nice but lacking here and there. For example, I ordered a Soda Xi Muoi (Plum Soda) but there was no taste of the soda at all. When I asked one of the server if she might have given me a Chanh Xi Muoi (Plum Lemonade) instead because I couldn't taste any soda in my drink, she immediately said it was definitely the correct order. Now, I honestly could care less if they had given the wrong order or if the soda was left out too long and lost all of its bubble. What bothered me is that after voicing out my concern, there wasn't any offers to remake the drink or any attempts to double check if it was the correct drink. 
As for the taste of the food, i'd give it 2.5 stars. 
Bun bo hue: lacked flavor and smell
Nem nuong: okay though more meat wouldve been better
Chicken pho: a bit bland, though i must say, the noodle's texture was great. 
I absolutely would not recommend the smoothies. I understand that most viet restaurants do use powder in their smoothies but for a strawberry smoothie to taste like toothpaste.. I honestly cannot defend it no matter how hard i try."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday! Fresh food, priced right, great owners and decor. Lots to choose from on the menu, healthy eating with favors to delight!"}
{"text":"The Pho is good and the service is great.  They are always friendly, welcoming, and quick, even when busy.  I get much more meat in my pho at this place than I have anywhere else.  The inside is clean and modern."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with friends and we were all very pleased.  We tried the Calamari for appetizer, the batter was good, not too much or overly seasoned and the meat was cooked perfectly; we did end up ordering it with our meal so it came out with the Pho.  I have only had Pho once before so don't have a lot to compare it to but I ordered the Tô Tái, Nm, Gu, Gân, Sách and really enjoyed it.  There was good flavor to the broth without being salty, all of the meat was tender and the add-ins were fresh.  I was also excited there was Durian smoothie and gladly ordered and drank the entire thing.  If I hadn't been so full after my meal I would have happily continued to eat more.  The staff was friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself was clean.  Definitely will come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Pho is so good and the service is fast in and out less then 30-40. Will come back and bring the family. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese restaurant. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. The descriptions on the menu are a little vague, but everything I have ordered has been good."}
{"text":"I usually go to pho avina as it is by my school but I tried this place out and the service is so much better compared to pho avina. Servers are great and food comes quickly. Price is probably a dollar or so more than my usual spot but the service and the nice restaurant is well worth it going out of your way. The food is great, but THE BOBA, they need to have more credit for their boba because they have the best I've tried in the valley for what I order ( taro coconut snow ) the most creamy Boba I've ever had. Better than bomboba, yo&i, and pho avina. I come here just for the Boba for the most part."}
{"text":"This spot has always been my Vietnamese restaurant to go to! Great costumer service, very clean and the food there is amazing."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner. Food was ok. Spring rolls were alright, could of used more flavors.  The pho was okay. I felt that the pho broth was too fatty. This flavor to me ruined the taste of the pho, especially towards the bottom of the bowl.  Also bathrooms on each side of the restaurant were a bit confusing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

My new favorite pho place in Arizona!

My parents house is only 20 minutes away from Little Saigon in Cali so I've always had my pick of good Pho. This place is pretty darn good, beats my usual pho spot, Pho Thanh in Phoenix. The broth is very flavorful and they have a good assortment of Vietnamese dishes. Prices are standard for this area. 

Normally I get the rare beef with flank or brisket, but I got it with just flank this time. Flank was more fat than meat so not sure if I'll get this here again. Maybe they just didn't have much meat today. Last time I got the rare beef with brisket, that was tasty . Regular size bowl is plenty of food, I usually can't finish it all. Got the Banh Xeo  today and though it was very flavorful and packed with shrimp, sprouts and onions, it was undercooked in some areas :( We've ordered the spring rolls before to go and they were good. 

My favorite thing here though is their Lychee smoothie, its soooo good. They must put ice cream in it or something, its amazingly creamy and flavorful. I know they have many flavors but I always have to order this when I'm here!

Big, clean restaurant, fast service, nice decor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So........................

I've been told that the best way to judge a Vietnamese restaurant, especially its pho, is by the broth. Specifically the pho bo, tai, nam, chin ,gan ( beef broth )....etc, etc. This place is OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!! I've had several places that do pho very well, but hands down this is my favorite place. I found out about it after a month or so of it opening and I'm really glad i did. Great cozy atmosphere, everyone is SUPER nice,  especially Maggie ).
:-) 

This is a MUST GO for anyone in the area, and if you aren't in the area....... get in your preferred method of transportation and GET THERE, like ASAP! 

Happy dining at Pho Viet"}
{"text":"At every pho restaraunt I go to I always order pho thai(noodles with rare steak) and a order or spring rolls or egg rolls. This place offered a 10$ combo which is you get to pick a type of pho, 1 spring roll or egg roll, and a soft drink. That deal had everything I want so I decided to try it but I also got extra meat. The spring rolls tasted better than places like da vang and pho tan. The pho was mediocre. But the price is ridiculous for extra meat. They charged 5.50 for extra meat which is unheard of. My bill came out to be 16.78 before tip. Would not recommend coming here if you want to get full.

*also, for this restaraunt to have over 300 reviews and standing at a 4.5 stars. Im sure a lot of the reviews are done by their people*"}
{"text":"Decent Pho Ga soup... although it was slightly cold when I had it.  Also, the peanut sauce for the spring rolls seemed watered down.  Otherwise decent food.  The service was really good, and the building is brand new and has two big flat screen TVs to watch sports or whatever."}
{"text":"Talk about customer service! They get your food out right away and keep you hydrated. I'm a fan of their coffee and they have a great special. You get a bowl of pho, drink and spring roll all for $10.00."}
{"text":"Super delicious, portions are a little small, at on my order, butttt there is an option to get bigger bowl/add more food. Definitely will go again :)"}
{"text":"What I had.
Bun bo hue 
Bun thit nuong cha gio

Bun bo hue was very good.  The broth was spot on.  Tasty, yet not too spicy.  Wish there were more vermicelli and a few more slices of beef.  3 thin slices just doesn't cut it for me.  Unphogettable in Mekong Plaza got this dish down pack.

Bun thit nuong cha gio was decent overall.  However, the egg roll had a weird fermented taste, I did not like that at all.  Again, a tad stingy on the vermicelli and only one egg roll for a dish that costs $8.50.  

This place was decent overall. Very clean and modern."}
{"text":"I ordered the spring rolls and the banh mi sandwiches. The Banh Mi's were excellent. The spring rolls were decent, I didn't care for the peanut sauce though. But that's fine with me as I really like hot sauce and hoison on my rolls."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch with my dad and boyfriend, and was very happy with the service and food. I ordered the chicken pho and was pleased, but decided to try some of my boyfriend's beef pho. I ended up eating all of his meal and he ate all of mine! the workers were so very kind and gave us plenty of recommendations and were greatly attentive. great lunch, even on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Literally the most phenomenal pho ever!!!!!!! 
I ordered takeout and ordered a large and they did not disappoint. There was plenty!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from SoCal and eat Vietnamese food at least 7 times a month so feel like I can speak on this restaurant. 

Service was amazing- fast, attentive, on top of their stuff. 

Food was perfect. 
Bun with egg rolls, grilled pork and shrimp paste

Can't think of anything wrong with this place. Been back a few times in the same week. Lol"}
{"text":"Wow! Having just returned from a trip to Vietnam I can say that the food here is super authentic and super delicious. The pho broth is spot on and the waitstaff is friendly, helpful, and happy to make recommendations. My favorites were the pho tai and the crepe!!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way from the east valley to come here. This place is always clean, service is fast, and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Love the Pho here! The broth is so flavorful compared to other places! The boba smoothies are delicious too...we always end our meal with them. The egg rolls lack a little flavor but they're not bad. The wing appetizers are tasty, as are the bahn mi's."}
{"text":"The ambiance is modern and light.  We were served quickly and efficiently by the staff who were very attentive.  The food came fast and was very tasty.  The prices are reasonable and the menu is very diverse! 
Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I found a large HAIR on my spring roll and all they did was exchange it for another order after I explained I did not want spring roll anymore. The guy in the front still charged me for the spring rolls with hair in them!  Never coming back! It's so sad I see good reviews that's what attracted me in the first place and to experience this."}
{"text":"My buddy and I came this place after attempting to go to another Vietnamese restaurant, Nam Sao and found out it was closed due to fire. 

When we walked in the first thing I noticed was how clean it was. Some places I have been look dingy and have an off smell. Not this place. 

I ordered a rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork, pork skin and egg rolls. We ordered spring rolls to share and my buddy got a bowl of pho. My friend was so impressed he told me to taste the broth. It was amazing! Layers of flavors and you could taste the herbs and spices. I decided then and there it would be the next thing I would order there. And while I was craving the bun, I was regretting not getting the pho. 

However, my dish was great. The pork was grilled perfectly. Some places seem to have a real problem overcooking pork when it's thin and grilled. The egg rolls were very flavorful as well. 

My friend has already recommended this place to some friends and I'm dying to go back."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great either. I ordered the Pho Ap Chao, which is a stir-fried broad flat noodle with veggies and meat. Although it probably isn't a fair comparison, it wasn't on the same level as the only other time I had this dish in San Jose, CA (which is practically a completely Vietnamese area). The sauce was a little thin and didn't incorporate well into the other parts of the dish. Spring rolls were decent and pretty standard compared to the few other times I've had spring rolls before. I probably wouldn't come back again unless I was in the immediate area and happened to be craving Vietnamese."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants. It's very clean inside with very friendly staff. Food is good but some of the dishes have small portions."}
{"text":"Have to give a shout-out to PHX Yelpers - my wife was craving pho, Yelp pointed me to Viet Pho, and we were NOT disappointed!  Stellar pho, tasty bahn mi, and poppin' spring rolls - really been happy with my meals here.  

The pho was hot and well-seasoned, the veggies are fresh and crisp, the house hot sauce is great, everything is clean and the staff is super accomodating.  We recently went with some kiddos and their kids menu (rice and chicken) was great, and they were super busy and they helped us clean up the kids' spilled water and dropped forks (I'm sure it wasn't their fave, but they were pros about it)

I'm always conflicted with banh mis - the flavors were there, but the bread:filing ratios always seem bread heavy.  For $4, I don't really care, but maybe I'll ask for double filings sometime.  Last time in I ordered a beef stew - same flavor profile as pho, but with chunks of beef, egg noodles, and carrots, really delicious if you're looking for something heartier.  Next time I want to try their pad thai, or maybe a udon noodle soup."}
{"text":"We love  Vietnamese food.  Being from CA we have lots of great restaurants so while in Phx we search and found Pho Viet Vietnamese Restaurant.  Great service, clean and very good food.  Good job guys, see you next trip to phoenix."}
{"text":"Honestly I never would give 5 stars but they were clean beautiful decor food was bomb I'm 31 I can say that. So happy I will be returning."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter came here on a Friday we sat down and waited 15 minutes and no one came by. I saw some servers walking around and the owner at the counter but no care for customer service.

We decided to leave and try somewhere this is ridiculous they were not even busy... well they lost a customer"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Can't beat the $10 special. Couldn't ask for me. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of different types of Vietnamese food. Had Beef Pho and found the food to be fresh with great flavor. The server was knowledgable about the menu and ready to help with answers to our questions.  The Pho came out quickly and was steaming hot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If this is the same Pho place that was here quite a while ago, and is now again open, and owned by the same mom & pop, it is fantastic!  I really need to go there again.  It's far from me, but worth every bit.  I shall expand my review after revisiting."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pho. Big portion and decent amount of meat. I love their service and the place was very clean. The price was good. I usually ordered pho tai or  noodle soup with beef. I like the taste. The only thing I think this place needs to work on is their fish sauce for their vermicelli dishes like bun cha gio or egg roll BBQ pork vermicelli, it wasn't authentic enough. But overall the pho was delicious."}
{"text":"The garlicky chicken wings are to die for!  After a rocky start with a pork dish, they made it right with a great substitution.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"The broth is excellent for their beef and chicken phò. It doesn't have that medicine-like taste sons phò places have.

They do give an average amount of meet in their phò dishes. I wish that they would give a bit more chicken or beef, but it's not really a concern."}
{"text":"I love the food! I have been testing PHO places around the phoenix/Glendale area and this restaurant is the winner thus far. I have been here now three times the good again is delicious the staff is quick and friendly I would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"We visit this Pho restaurant usually a few times a month. This is great place for everyone in my family to enjoy. The family is very friendly and the food is always hot and fresh. I hate to mention this but they can definitely be a smidge faster with serving drinks and appetizers while we are waiting for our main meal because when you have kids with you-they definitely start to misbehave until they get their food served-I understand if they are busy but usually this is when there are only a few people in restaurant. Another recent observation I have noticed were the prices-they have increased a bit and they are several dollars more for most of the meals in comparison to other Pho restaurants close by. 
Even though this restaurant is located in busy shopping center-there is always plenty of parking. 
The restaurant is always clean and the tables/booths are never dirty. 
One great option for people on the go-you can call in your order for pick up so you are in and out. 
Overall I do recommend this place if you are looking for fresh authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time, I loved that it was so clean, the staff very friendly, the food delicious!!!! Definitely will be back!!! So glad I live up the street and won't have to travel so far for my addiction of spring rolls and peanut sauce!! The shrimp pho was delicious! Portions were good, prices I felt were good, my husband and son both enjoyed it and they aren't really fans of this type of food and they both loved it!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Northern Vietnam pho in town!!! Beside pho, they have lots of great food too. I love their boba. It's even better than lots of boba tea place in town. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean. Those are reasons why Pho Viet is my first choice for Vietnamese cuisine!"}
{"text":"I love pho viet! It's hands down the best pho restaurant  I've found so far in Phoenix.! Not only is the food amazing but the family who owns it is so cute and friendly! I alway feel welcomed when I dine here. The dad reminds me alot of my own dad who lives back home in California haha. My go to pho restaurant for sure! Oh try the avocado smoothie! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"It's really strange because I see Angela's and Pho KC get better reviews than this restaurant. I love it here, my girlfriend is Vietnamese so we went around to multiple pho places to try and see what had the best bowl. Now, I will say that their work isn't consistent, but 3 out of 4 times everything was perfect. The bowls are very large, and proportioned very accurately, the broth is perfect, and I love to add sprouts, jalapeños, and sriracha to my bowl for some more flavor. Their Goi Cuon Is delicious, neatly proportioned, with a nice presentation. It must be had with their peanut sauce which is like a kiss of heaven. The classic Pho Dac Biet I would highly recommend in a large bowl if you've got the stomach for it. It's so delicious, the bits of flak, brisket, tendon, it brings the broth and noodles all together to a perfect blend. As for my personal favorite dish, is a bit for the fans of spice and hot things. The Bun Bo Hue is a spicy dish with Vermicelli noodles, beef shank, pork leg, and of course tendon. I believe the spice is a perfect complement for the noodles and shank when eaten together, and the pork leg is like a little gift on the side."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but there's always some lack of flavor in their entrees.  We've had their pho and rice dishes and several appetizers but nothing stands out that makes me want to come back again."}
{"text":"Quick service and very tasty. Plus the staff pay attention to needs of all tables, not just their assigned ones. And I didn't get any judgmental looks for eating alone."}
{"text":"This place. Seriously. Tried Pho Viet last weekend and oh my god was it good. Ordered eggrolls, rare beef pho and grilled pork bahn mi. Everything was delicious. Like the kind of delicious where you are thinking about it 5 days later.

Restaurant was very clean, server was polite and prices were fair. We will return."}
{"text":"This place is the bee knees! Definitely my favorite place to get Pho in the valley, and I've tried a lot of them. There is nothing fancy about this place, but the food is fantastic. The family that runs the place is always pleasant and since my family and I go regularly they recognize us and always make a point to say hi and have a brief chat. 

Pho is pretty straightforward before you \"personalize\" it with sauces and add ins. The difference is all in the broth, and in my opinion, theirs is great. Not to sweet, not too salty, and not too much cinnamon (I know that sounds crazy, but I've had some that have a very strong cinnamon taste). 

The only small complaint I have is that the blenders they use for the smoothies are so loud, but the service is always good, and fast, and most importantly the food is great.

UPDATE: they have purchased new blenders that seemed to be much quieter and less obtrusive. Awesome job!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. Staff is friendly, the place is beautiful and the food is mighty tasty. I am never steered wrong when I want to try a new item and even though this place has only been open for a short time, I feel like they are family. They get to know you and what you order as well as remember what you have ordered (and liked) in the past.  They are VERY attentive and want to ensure that you have a great experience. Do you have a question? Ask away! I keep coming back because it's like a home away from home...without the curfew."}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a week and this is the first time we tried the strawberry mousse pie.
It will not be the last time as it was AMAZING!
Light, not too sweet, but super tasty and fresh."}
