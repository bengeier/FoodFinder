{"text":"Here's the Real Deal on this place. 

Ok The Barn has been open since 1971. 
Same owners since 1971. This place makes the best old school Bacon and eggs for under six bucks in the city. This place opens at 10 am or just before pretty well 365 days a year. This is a Queen street west regular breakfast place. He does your typical greasy spoon menu. The club houses are made with fresh turkey breast twice a week. The chicken fingers are to die for, and he has one hell of a gravy with fries. 

Take Out is a bonus there. The place does get some interesting characters in there.  So don't let that stop you because the food is worth it. Try the burgers cooked the same way like the did in 1971. 

Table service yes. This is a great breakfast place nothing fancy but the food is always good. Myself I've been going there for about 25 years and never had a bad breakfast 

That's the Real Deal on this place and remember the food is worth the time.
Still open still awesome 2015"}
{"text":"Barn Restaurant takes you back to a simpler time.  You can tell the restaurant hasn't change one bit since it opened many decades ago.  It's family owned and run and prices are yet to meet inflation.  

The restaurant offers simple diner food, breakfast with sausage or bacon, westerns, club sandwiches, burgers, french fries and more. It's a small menu but they do it all well with most prices ranging from about $5-10 or so. 

The restaurant locals are...characters to say the least.  They may change your dining experience and your view of the restaurant.  I personally haven't had any bad run ins with them, they usually stay together in the back area of the resto.  I would recommend just grabbing a bar seat.  I can see why a lot of people gave the place a negative review because of the locals, I don't want to say they're friendly per-say but they aren't mean or bad people, just some of the older Queen St. W generation looking for a spot to drink a beer. If you don't bug them chances are they won't bug you.

I like the spot for a quick and cheap breakfast bite, you can't beat a $5 breakfast with perfectly cooked eggs and actually good quality chunky slices of bacon."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this. A hole-in-the wall diner that serves the classics?

Alas, no dice. The sausages were legitimate nasty, the toast subpar, the eggs just eh, and the potatoes just ... like cut up boiled potatoes that were slightly fried."}
{"text":"One of the last old school greasy spoons left in downtown Toronto. The owners Chris and Christine are gems. We have a toddler and it's a great spot to take your kid in for breakfast/brunch... a bit latter in the day and the whole block gets a bit sketchy in the evening, but my partner and I are from here so it's nothing compared to what it used to be! If you need a benchmark this restaurant has the cleanest bathroom in the block, including fancy places. Great antidote to Queen West airs and overpriced meals. Everyone is really nice and Christine will love your child to pieces and show them the back of the counter. Nothing is fancy, the burgers are great, the Greek salad is crunchy and over flowing with feta, and the rest is pretty standard, which is just fine for the price! (Get the bacon and not sausage with your eggs.) The only place for miles to be able to eat breakfast for under $25 for two people. Hope this stays the same for another 46 years."}
{"text":"We were pulled in by a cute sign on the window advertising poutine for 6 dollars. When we walked in we were greeted and served by a sweet sweet lady.

As for the poutine; It was was a big portion that filled 2 of us. Only down side, they didn't use cheese curds, but there was ample gravy and shredded cheese. The fries were crispy, thus achieving a perfectly balanced texture.

When we went to pay the man doing all the cooking started chatting with us and we found out about their breakfast. So the next day we went and had a typical Canadian breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, toast and coffee. It was really yummy and really filling. 

The inside of the restaurant does feel like a barn (wooden beams), and perhaps could use some renovations, but the service and food was great. They seemed to know what many of the customers wanted when they entered even before being seated, regulars I guess. (Some of the people there were a little sketch, but most were pretty normal people - so don't get weirded out). Maybe thats why this place was so good, it felt like you were eating at a small breakfast inn out in the country where they know you cause you live 2 houses down from them. Truly a slice of peace and nice caring staff in the city."}
