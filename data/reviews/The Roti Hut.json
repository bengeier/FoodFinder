{"text":"I make it a point to try Caribbean Jamaican food whenever i can and this place without a doubt has the beat Roti i have ever had. 
The restaurant is fresh and clean and the staff are very pleasant. Saved it as one of my favourite places to eat when in the area."}
{"text":"Expensive but bland food in a dressed down place. If they could focus on the cuisine, and then on the service, they might have something here."}
{"text":"First off I love their doubles! Maybe because I'm a white guy they went lax on the spices and I should have asked for a bit more pepper.  I found the doubles needed perhaps a little tamarind sauce just to set it off but all around my wife and I enjoyed them.  

Secondly, I ordered the jerk chicken, don't ask me why I would order it in a Trini place, but sometimes it's a hit, sometimes it's a miss, this, was a MISS.  This was basically stewed chicken, I tasted no jerk spice whatsoever, but more so a slightly tomato based rendition of something with peas and rice below it.  

Thirdly, the maniacal matriarch of this place who runs the front of house was not present...bonus marks for that.  She's very rude and condescending at times which sways me from frequenting this place.  If shes there expect teeth-sucking and roti slapping(yeah sorry there lady I never ordered the buss-up-shot)

I'll give them a 4 because I've had many solid meals there, this one was just slightly sub-par but still decent.

p.s. Where the hell are the bake and saltfish?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been going to the roti hut since I was a kid.........fast forward 30+ yrs and I still am ! They have never lost their touch when it comes to roti, always fresh and melts in your mouth.
If you are in the area and crave a roti of any kind this is the place to be !!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out after reading all of the great reviews. 

Had the chicken roti and doubles and I have to say that it was under whelming.  

The doubles were good, had a nice spicy kick. 

The roti on the other hand was on the salty side. The curry was not that great either. I've had much better elsewhere. 

Although this is an average roti place, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just went today to check out the Roti Hut.
I must say I was very impressed with the Beef Stew Roti, was very filling and mouth-wateringly delicious. 

09/10 is my rating for the food I had. I definitely highly recommend having the Beef Stew Roti you will always go back to have more."}
{"text":"Ordered the boneless Goat and Chicken roti... had to say was very disappointed! The roti skin itself was very dry...the sauce didn't make any difference!"}
{"text":"The Roti Hut makes my mouth soooo happy. I had to slow it down as we were going there at least twice a week...and the pounds were starting to pack on. Love their boneless chicken. This place is SUPER clean! Even my mom noticed and she's the pickiest person ever.
Everyone is friendly. You could see in the back how clean they keep everything and even how wonderful and fresh the chicken which they were preparing looked. Best roti!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has changed with the roti over the years but today I got a boneless chicken roti and I am surprised to say it was not very good. Dry chicken. Weird taste to the roti skin. Paid 10.70 would not pay $2.00 for that little bit of sub par curry with a ton of dough around it. U fell off peeps. Server was  good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch Sunday afternoon.  This was a good time to dine in as only a handful of customers were at the restaurant.  Food did not take long to be served."}
{"text":"This place is 3 parts memory, 1 part food, or maybe 1 part memory, 3 parts food.  Either way, it's a very good thing.  I remember coming here back when I was in high school, and then even once in a blue moon when I was back in town for a visit, but I hadn't been in at least 7 years and came upon it while taking a detour back to McCowan because I was trying to get back on the 401.  We would always, always, always order it to go, and I actually don't think it had a formal dining area at the time.  So when I realized where I was, I pulled into the plaza and did a double-take.  No bars on the windows!  And what appeared to be a dining area with soft lighting and booths!  There isn't any waiter service, you still go in, pay for your order and should you decide to eat in, then proceed to the dining areal.  The roti was just as I remembered it.  The size of a small pillow and filled with fragrant, lightly curried meat.  I did take it back to my parents place and wolfed it down....with my bottle of Grace Banana Soda.  My father even had to ask if I ate the whole thing because it was so huge, and was gone in record time.   And then I took a nap.  You just can't get roti like this in Vancouver."}
{"text":"My boyfriend makes fun of me saying that I only come visit him at his workplace if we plan on getting roti from here. I wish I could say that that ain't true, but he is oh so right. This place is freaking awesome. I love their boneless chicken roti and doubles. Since it's so far from me, I've  had to try to find a substitute roti place nearby, and believe me when I say that I searched only for other highly ranked places in my area. Unfortunately although they're good, they still don't compare to this god send place.."}
{"text":"My go to roti and doubles place. God this place is friggin' fantastic!!

Whenever I have that craving for roti or a good double, I run to The Roti Hut. Writing this review alone makes my mouth water.

I've tried the plethora of rotis and doubles that Scarborough as to offer, and nobody can touch The Roti Hut. 

The chicken put in the roti is a tad more dry than I would like, but the flavour is ALWAYS spot on. As with the doubles, always delicious with that greasy goodness. And that's what keeps me from coming back here time and time again. The Roti Hut is perpetually consistent in quality. And that's the number one thing I always look for when I dine out. All of my top go to places have one thing in common, consistency. 

It's tucked away in a small down hill street, but not too far from the main road.

The service here is always great, food comes out (weirdly) quick and the staff always serve you with a smile.

I highly recommend The Roti Hut!"}
{"text":"Have been going regularly for the last couple of years.  Huge rotis stuffed with flavor! They do not skimp out here!  One roti feeds two. The atmosphere is nice too for a grab and go place."}
{"text":"A roti is essentially a hardy flour pancake wrapped around a curry dish which can include chicken, chickpeas (on the menu as channa), goat, etc.

It's not exactly a healthy lunch but it is definitely filling and delicious! By filling I mean heavy, these things weigh, no joke, like 2 lbs! I've never managed to finish one in a single sitting.

After standing in line in the main room where you order, pay and wait for your meal to be presented you can head into the dining room to eat your roti (which is actually really nice), or take the food away with you in a brown paper bag.

They have other options on the menu too like jerk chicken, but why would you go to a roti hut and not order a roti?

The roti themselves are pretty mild, but the hot sauce they offer (you have to ask for this) makes my forehead just drip sweat! 

Attractive, I know.

The staff have always been friendly and efficient. A great quick lunch option (though maybe not if you have client meetings after...my twice washed hands still smell like curry)."}
{"text":"I have no idea how to take good food photos when I mangle the roti so no photos for this brief review 

I recently went with some friends and we tried the jerk chicken, the duck, and beef. For the amount we paid, we received great value and size (I think these rotis are at least 2lb and filled to the brim with ingredients). I enjoy spice and the levels of hotness here are definitely high. Get one of their nice sodas so you can feel that carbonated burn along with the spice :D"}
{"text":"I came back here for a second time and got to try their Jerk Chicken and Doubles with Curry Goat. I have to say I really enjoyed both of these over the Curry Goat Roti I had on my first visit. I would come back again for either of these."}
{"text":"Went to this place the other day and tried some curry goat with rice and peas with some cabbage and carrots on the side.  To my surprise, there was indoor seating at this place unlike many other places in Scarborough.  But like most other caribbean places, I still had to add a lot of pepper sauce to my dish to get some heat to it.  But otherwise, the goat was very tender, the cabbage and carrots were nicely cooked, and the rice was fine.  A surprising addition was dal as I wasn't aware that my meal would come with any but it was a nice surprise.  My only real complaint was that my food wasn't all that hot temperature-wise.  But overall, one of the better West Indian places I've tried in the GTA."}
{"text":"Gota admit.  This place makes a darn good roti!  A bit on the pricey side at $10.70 with tax, but it was very tasty.  I ordered a boneless chicken breast roti, and I will visit again.

------------

Fast forward a year or so and I visited on a Sunday. Waited 30 min for a jerk chicken with rice and peas.  Understaffed on Sundays. Paid $15.36 tax included.  Very pricey, and the portion did not fill me.  Yes the chicken was very good, and spice was just right, but not worth the price for the portion you get.  I was leaning towards a 4 of 5, but will have to give it a 3 since it will probably get more pricey from here on.

C.L."}
{"text":"When I'm craving heavy and starchy food...this is it!

I've only visited this place during lunch cause it's close to work and off the highway.  It's not for everyone.  Most of the food is spicy.  For me, it's just right and my tolerance is high.

Been here multiple times and always GREAT!

Place is clean and nice (renovated a year ago) for a rundown plaza.  Does smell like curry, once you step in.  Be warned, if you're sensitive to smell.

I usually order curry boneless chicken or jerk chicken in Roti or on rice.  There's a great selection of beverages from Grace and more.  Carbonated soft drink is great with spicy food.  Their curry isn't saucy but it's not meant to be soup.  If that's what you're looking for, stick to non-spicy Japanese and Thai curry.  Indian and Caribbean curry is meant for dipping/side.

Today, I ordered Jerk Chicken Roti with Grace's Pineapple soda that came to $10.00.  You can share with two, if you're a small eater!"}
{"text":"Love it we come from Yonge and Lawrence to eat here, worth every penny always consistent."}
{"text":"I love the roti hut! The food is good and they have PEANUT PUNCH! It's like drinking peanut butter but it's fantastic! You order up front like a fast food joint. 

There is lot's of seating and it's comfortable. However, the plaza is ghetto in which this restaurant is situated in."}
{"text":"The best roti I've had in Toronto.  I've been coming to Roti Hut for 10 years even though it's a bit of a trek.

My favourite here is the boneless goat.  The roti is grainy and soft, the meat is tender and the curry has just a bit of spice.  Add their homemade hot sauce for a little extra kick.  A surprise for me was the pumpkin and spinach roti I tried once.  It was delicious and just enough sweet.  A great option for for a vegetarian.  Make sure you get a few doubles to go.  They taste great reheated.

Service is friendly.  Go at off hours to avoid any potential line ups.  I've yet to try a roti, whether home made or at a restaurant better than roti hut!"}
{"text":"We were recommended by family who live in Toronto. We tried the doubles, they were OK , a little on the dry side but reasonably priced.  Tried the police balls they were nice and fresh. The peanut punch was great. Also had their chicken and potatoes , there was no. Chick peas  in the roti . The roti was not well seasoned . The jerk chicken had too much sauce. The gal messed up my order but there were 9 of us. I was reasonably surprised . Portions were big. Hot sauce was a little weak. Price seem average. Service was not great"}
{"text":"Kept very clean.Air-conditioned
Soft music and good environment!!!

Perfect place for families.

Must have ! :)"}
{"text":"had the boneless chicken...and it was good...the roti was soft...

have heard good reviews about the boneless mutton...that will be my next venture"}
{"text":"We decided to come check this place out ourselves since we wanted great tasting food. It was a short drive from where we were staying so that made it even better. This place is located in a small shopping center, but don't let the exterior scare you away. 

Once you enter, it's like escaping to the Caribbean islands. The sound, the aroma and the ambience. You have to order first and then get your food. Prices are reasonable and the food tasted great. 

We got an order of jerk chicken & curry chicken Rotis, channa double and two potatoe balls. 

The secret to having the flavor burst in your mouth is add the hot sauce that's on the table. This sauce is amazing, full of spices and flavor. It was like my mouth was having an orgasm. 

In my opinion, I really likes the chicken curry roti. It had lots of flavor and the chicken was super tender so it was great savorying the taste. 

The potatoe balls were a bit plan jane for me. There wasn't any flavor to them and some spice to it. 

Overall, this place is a hidden gem in the area and is a must go to place for grab a bite."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday at noon and there were no customers. Got the curry goat roti and doubles with chicken. The roti was soft but the goat lacked any spice and the double tasted bland and it barely had any sauce!"}
{"text":"Living on the West coast for the past few years has limited my access to West Indian food - it is almost non-existent in Vancouver. This time around, during my visit home, it was necessary for me to eat something I knew I wouldn't be able to get upon returning to YVR: boneless chicken roti.

The boneless chicken roti at Roti Hut was stuffed to the max. I thoroughly enjoyed it - moist chicken, ample seasoning and a roti shell with the perfect texture! If I had room, I would've tried the doubles. I guess I'll save that treat for my next visit home!"}
{"text":"Holy crap they're humongous!  They'd make a solid paper weight or some kind of scuba equipment.

I had the Goat Roti.  Taste was good, but a little dry.

It's a very nice place tucked away in a little neighbourhood strip mall which was a bit of a delightful surprise! Service was supremely quick and the roti was in front of my face before I could even get the change back from my order.

I think Mad D., doubled her weight just by eating half of her Roti.

{"text":"The best boneless chicken roti in all of gta. Been coming here for over 15 years. Tastes just as good as back when it was a dive joint. Service isn't the best but who cares...if any of you are from the islands you will know it's pretty much standard island service levels. Speed of service is always up or down depending on the person at cash. I come here for the food. The service isn't so bad that I can't tolerate the wait and robotic service at times..."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3

This is a nice little \"fast-food\" joint if you want to get a quick fix for some Indian food. When I first walked in, it looked pretty nice and clean. It wasn't anything special though. The place is exactly as you would expect just from looking at the pictures. One thing to note is that they have a hand washing station in the dining area, which comes in REAL handy, because it can get messy and really spicy for those sensitive to spicy foods. 

The service was mediocre, the woman behind the counter wasn't that nice to us at first, since I assume she thought we were just some high school kids that wouldn't order anything. We asked for her suggestion, and she said to get the boneless chicken breast roti. She cheered up after we ordered, and was actually pretty nice to us with a smile.

We ended getting their friday/saturday special, \"curry duck\" roti and their suggestion, and boneless chicken breast roti. These may look small, but these are actually stuffed to the brim. Unfortunately, these are mostly roti rolled to the point where it gets really thick. You know how wraps can taste bad when it's rolled and you could only taste the dough? This is what the roti tasted like on the edges, which is unfortunate. I'm used to the thin, lightly toasted, and rich tasting roti, like the one at South Asian Malaysian Curry. The meat on the other hand was very flavourful, and for those who like spicy foods, this was not too hot. Personally too hot for me, but this should hit the medium level in terms of spiciness. 

The meat on top of rice looks good though when I was looking at the other people beside me. I would personally not come again, since it's not my cup of tea, but I have nothing against it."}
{"text":"Mmm!  So I've been trying to find a good roti shop - the Caribbean kind!  I had the boneless beef roti and it was flavourful but not overpowering and not too spicy.  They mixed the beef with some potato but not a lot ( like other places) so that it wasn't too wet. We saw the women in the back making the roti fresh!  Apparently they started the store at least a decade ago.  There was a steady stream of customers.   They had a huge selection of drinks as well including coconut water, grace carbonated drinks and mauby - a drink made from tree bark. The roti was soft.   I definitely could have shared the roti - at least for lunch.  Great place for authentic roti. If I'm ever in this area I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Rotis are truly excellent. They are very tasty. Service a bit slow and food a bit expensive, but I will definitely be going back if I ever pass by Toronto again."}
{"text":"the place is tucked in the corner of the plaza and rhe wait time is 10+ minutes. their doubles are awesome and I usually get jerk chicken roti. they keep a good amount of sauce in but its good to ask for extra! delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh man 

Where do I start

First I miss this place

Used to work nearby there and this place I used to frequent at lunch all the time

Next the food

Hooooo weeeee

Chicken roti
Doubles

The food is definitely a hit

Good Carribean food made proper

I have to make it back for a bite to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"Summary: generous portion of roti is decent and
comes at an okay price, but it's the tasty doubles and the fun and fast customer service that stand out!

It's ROTI HUT, but to me, two doubles here are better value than one roti. Don't get me wrong - the roti isn't bad: sure, it's a bit dry, the lamb is disappointingly not-tender, but the chicken (jerk chicken) is pretty good and has a mild kick that enhances the flavour without overpowering... it's one of the few places where I get chicken over lamb.

However, the doubles (basically a chickpea sandwich)  gets me every time. They're just ridiculously good, filling, and good value.

As for the restaurant itself, it's clean, comfortable and well managed. I think the decor adds to the experience. 

Solid place for Caribbean fair."}
{"text":"You can not find a better roti in Toronto, but if you find one closer to my work, please let me know!

The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you're feeling a little vegetarian. You can ask for spinach on any of the rotis, and I heartily recommend it. You must try the chicken/beef/vegi patties, they are so fluffy and the filling is seasoned perfectly.

There are all kinds of Caribbean drinks including Malta, Coconut Water, Ginger Beer, Ting, Mauby and Peanut Milk.  Have a beventure!

Once in a while they will have fresh doubles, but never before 12, and they go quickly.  This is classic Caribbean fast food and they are awesome, and if you get the chance, try them!

Roti Hut  also sports a full selection of ice cream including sour sop, and rmango."}
{"text":"The best place to eat if you enjoy West Indian food. 

Lots of veggie options and the roti will not disappoint you. I grew up with this place and it's been in busy for over 30 years. 

The food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"A fantastic humble setting to get your Caribbean taste buds satisfied. We got chicken curry and goat curry with roti. The rotis were great. Goat curry can be more spicy (thus the 4 stars). The highlight was the chicken curry, it was just amazing.  And lastly the price is great."}
{"text":"Bad service. Great food, clean location. 
The lady at the from desk was miserable, would go back because of the lack of customer service"}
{"text":"I had the chicken roti. It was good but not the best roti I've ever had. Service was pretty poor so I think that may have ruined the experience for me. Cashier/waitress was not friendly at all! She forgot to add my doubles to the order even though I paid for it. When I told her, she was very rude about correcting the problem."}
{"text":"Before I ordered i specifically asked if they cook the food fresh  as it was 11am i found it hard to believe she made duck curry so fast  as it came it was ice cold in the middle. I asked if the phulouri was made to order, she also said yes. 2 microwave beeps later my food was ready. I believe the only fresh thing here is the roti. Your best off buying plain roti from this place and find something better to put in it."}
{"text":"why do you have to be in Scarborough?!??!!?
This is the best Carribean Style ROTI I've ever tasted in Toronto area...
AMAZING curry, good prices, easy going staff...
living downtown is the challenge, Scarborough is awful, not as awful as say; Brampton.. but this place is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at the Roti Hut so often lately, I feel like an update is necessary.  I wished I ordered the vegetarian one even back when I ate meat because its so much better!  My fav is Chick pea and potato but they also have pumpkin and spinach as an add on option.  Also, instead of roti, you can get rice instead.

I love the little fried dough thing they have that looks like timbits.  I don't know what its called but its the first item on the sides menu and only $1-2."}
{"text":"Boneless Chicken Roti from the Roti Hut is awesome! The curry has such a nice flavour and it's made with chicken breast. They put a good amount of gravy and they kicked it up for me. I love the pepper sauce so much I can't help but add more to it, it's got a great heat and flavour that isn't at all vinegary. 

We got there just in time tonight before the lineup was at the door. 

Great hearty meal, excellent taste and quality and a very fair price.

Love Roti Hut.."}
{"text":"When I give a 5 star, it's because the food is amazing, and the service is what I expect or more. The roti hut is not anything fancy for the decor, but they have a killer Roti, the Roti originated in Trinidad and is a popular dish in the Caribbean, a wrap consisting of an unleavened stoneground whole meal flour, filled with curried goat, or chicken or beef. My favorite is the goat, with chicken a close second. This is a hidden gem for me, I visit once a month for my Spicy Roti Fix, I love supporting small independent places where they take pride in their food and concepts, the menu all looks good but I have only had the rotis and the jerk chicken, both amazing, if you like curry, spice and goat, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I always get the curry chicken dark meat bone in. The portion is insane here, it's honestly enough to feed 2 ppl unless you're reeeeally starving. The flavour, the texture, the spice... everything is just spot on. Just talking about it makes me salivating.."}
{"text":"A local neighbourhood that has great roti and authentic caribbean food. I always come for the roti, either the goat or the chicken. Have never been disappointed by the quality or the quantity of the food. I can get through about half of the roti before I'm full but still continue to eat because it's just so good. I need to try some more of the menu but keep getting drawn back to the rotis. 

Everything is ordered at the takeout counter the moment you walk in, but there is a large dining area to the side that is great if you want to dine in instead. They even bring the food to you and there are bottles of bright yellow hot sauce on each table for you to enjoy. A relaxing area to enjoy your food at your own pace."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years! I'm 27 now and remember coming here with my mother when I was like 6. Hands down the best roti in Toronto I have had to date. Def check it out! And get a double!"}
{"text":"This restaurant should be embarrassed. 21 dollars for oxtail and the portion is so small they took what regularly one oxtail and divided into 4 small pieces. Really bad experience and does not taste as good as Simply Irie which I highly recommend. Also there is an old lady that is very rude behind the counter."}
{"text":"Just amazing food! The chicken curry roti is my favourite. I drive down from Newmarket to pick up a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Been there three times 

First time didn't have a pleasant experience with my goat roti (dry, hard and cold). Didn't go back since than but I was craving for roti so I decided to give it another try. 

Second time I ordered chicken roti with extra sauce (it was good). 

Third time I went back and got a beef roti (dry, hard and Luke warm). I think they gave me a beef roti that was sitting there for a while that someone didn't pick up. 

Would have given them 1 star but the girls at the counters were awesome."}
{"text":"I had the goat roti and there wasn't a lot of meat. I am a big eater and I could easily eat 3 of these but even 1 should be enough to make you full... it's $11/roti so it's expensive too. The goat was a bit dry too but the pepper sauce is great."}
{"text":"Came here on 06/17/2015 at lunch with my cousins, have tried Drupati's in the past but came here to give it a shot.

The plaza it's located in seems a little run-down, but this is a review for the establishment, and the inside of this place was clean. We looked at the menu and I ordered the Boneless Goat Roti as well as a Double. 

There's a nice seating area and they bring the food to you, definitely a great place to bring friends, but more of a casual/fast-food sitting area. The roti was huge, there was plenty of goat, and the spices were great. Definitely a satisfying roti. Had a great ratio of meat, I prefer a little spicier so I ate it with the complimentary pepper sauce. The double was a thing of beauty, the bun was deep fried to perfection and was great to accompany it.

Another great place for roti in Scarborough, definitely recommend it!

Cheers!

The Roti Hut has been a Scarborough gem for the longest time serving classic West Indian fare such as roti's, rice dishes, etc...

Man its been years since I've been here...last time was when it was just a little dinky take out spot but now its expanded into a full sit down spot with the same great food!  

The system works like this, line up at the front, give your order, grab a seat and they'll bring the food to you in almost no time at all!

The boneless beef roti I had was fantastic.  Soft homemade roti shells, tender beef with potatoes and sauce.  The double (Dahl Puri) was soft delicious and full of flavour.

Service was excellent and friendly.  Definitely highly recommended to get your West Indian fix!  

Now excuse me while I \"warg\" back to the Islands!  Go House Stark!!!"}

Roti was pretty good, nice and soft! Goat tasted watered down.. But it did have enough goat and not much potatoes which is good..

Was expecting more for a 4 star Yelp restaurant tho..probably won't be back..

{"text":"Craving some Island delights and decided to visit the Roti Hut for an early lunch.   Ordered the Chicken Breast Roti,  Doubles and Sparkling Pear Soda to share.  Roti was but a tad salty for my taste.   It was, however, perfect eaten with the Doubles.   Pear Soda tasted like hard cider which was ok.   They also serve Grace Pops and Ting.  The line up for lunch can get long (come before 12:30pm or after 1:30pm)."}
{"text":"The roti hut is a place that's been around for sometime; for those looking for some curry and roti and not wanting to take any risk this is a good place to go. 

They've got a clean and good looking environment and the curry and roti is good.

I had boneless Chicken Breast and Roti."}
{"text":"Ordered the boneless chicken roti $9 and I had high hopes for it! The chicken was dry and not enough curry to compensate it. Not a huge fan of the roti itself... But this is in general as they put some form of nut spread or something in it -- making it really gritty. I prefer Indian roti that's for sure. 

However the music they play makes you feel like youre in the Caribbean. Love that."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about eating in this joint because we did take out. I am reviewing strictly on the boneless chicken roti I had. To begin with, it was a decent size, but the weigh of it alone let me know that it was stuffed full. First bite, I was taken aback. This didn't taste like what I am used to getting. Then I put my finger on it. The roti itself was made fresh and its texture was a little more spongy than the premade, pulled out of a plastic bag roti I'm used to which tends to be a bit more dry and crumbly. Maybe for this reason, the filling wasn't overly saucy. It was, however, jam-packed with tender, flavourful chicken. No skimping on the meat quota here! Despite my better judgement, I devoured the whole thing in one sitting. What a bellyful, but a happy one!

My biggest regret is that I didn't get to try the double my friend had picked up in addition to the roti. I was just too stuffed full, so I meant to take it with me but forgot! A sad day as I LOVE a good double, but an excellent reason to return to the heart of Scarbs for yet another meal. Maybe pick up some jerk chicken too as I've been told it is legit!"}
{"text":"Tried the oxtail with beans and rice and the curry chicken roti. Both were both surprisingly good. I had low expectations going in. I am from Trinidad and used to the excellent roti shops in Montreal and Toronto. The oxtail was very good and the curry was almost there also. The curry was good but missing something to make take it over the top.
I would recommend this place. Only complaint is that it is very expensive for Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Roti's are good, but dry. They dont have any gravy, cause when you ask for it, they say ok, then give you your roti the same old way, without any sauce. 

My friends joke this is the roti nazi, cause you can't ask for anything extra, take it as it is or leave. 

But still better than most other roti places."}
{"text":"I have been to this place three times. I want to like this place, but the roti each time has been a bit dry. The portions are reasonable, but the both the sauce the the shell are a dry. Quite mild and not very spicy. Light on the gravy/sauce. Particularly the shell, the dryness makes the roti a bit tough and chewy to eat. 

As for the service, the ladies behind the counter appear to be friendly. (I've only ordered take-out each time.)

Perhaps it's just me. I like my roti to oozing with gravy and spices with smooth, soft smell. 

Parking is limited to about 10 spots, but the mini-strip/plaza is rarely busy."}
{"text":"Great place for some authentic Trinidad roti and doubles. Portions are fair and tasty! 
Price is also fair based on the portions. 
Forgot to add, parking is terrible. You will understand when you go."}
{"text":"My family has been frequenting the Roti Hut since it was a tiny hole in the wall takeout counter almost 2 decades ago. I believe I was ten when I had roti for the first time and that was 17 years ago. Lydia has really devoted herself to her business and is at work everyday, whether serving, preparing, or at cash. The woman does not sleep, I'm sure of it!
The Roti is quite good and the quality has stayed consistent. Portions are massive and always flavourful. The price has creeped up a bit on the high side for a roti, but I appreciate the service and the efficiency of this place to get your food to you hot and fresh. Never had better doubles in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I got take out. It's been a while since I was there, but I think I ordered the chicken roti. It cost about ten dollars, but I ate it in three portions since the thing was so dense and large. Very yummy. I would come here again to try other items."}
{"text":"Place is clean staff are friendly and quick but most importantly they def make the best roti you can find in Toronto. We go once a month to satisfy our craving. If you like hear ask for pepper."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Best Roti I've ever had.  Highly recommend making a stop.  Doesn't look like anything from the outside BUT the inside taste is amazing!! One of my friends stops here every time he's in the city it's so good."}
