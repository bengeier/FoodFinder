{"text":"This is my second visit in one week. I like this restaurant. They are specialized in chinese hot and spicy food and also the northern authentic chinese food. Dumpling and their cold dishes are are great. Their smoky duck (not Peking duck) is tender, juicy and full of smoke flavor and is so delicious. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"We knew that this restaurant has been in business for a while now, having taken over the space that used to be occupied by Snow Palace, but have not had to chance to try it out until now.  The place was busy when we were there, but there were still open tables.  There were only two waitresses when we were there and they were definitely a lot of running around and probably needs a third person there to help out.  There was quite a wait for the food but once the first dish came out the others came shortly after.  The food that we ordered were tasty and of a decent portion. The rice was only $1 per person, which is reasonable unlike some restaurants.  Service was good.  There was a language barrier but the waiting staff seemed to be willing to accommodate our requests.  The restaurant noise level is on the loud side due to the small size of the restaurants and all the hard surfaces.  If there is a 1/2 star to give, I would give a solid 3.5 star (rounded up to 4 for Yelp).  There are a lot to like about this restaurant.  There are items on the menu that you just cannot get in most of the Chinese restaurants in town.  We will be back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Checked out Mr. Guo for the first time on Saturday afternoon with the family. We normally go to Snow Palace (the previous owners) but decided to check the new place out for lunch.   Big mistake.   Once inside, we were greeted by an extremely dirty restaurant. Listen, we go to tons of ethnic restaurants and I get how sometimes they may not be as \"clean\" but this was alarmingly dirty. We were surrounded by tables with food and drinks from the previous night. Bottles of beer bottles, lobster shells on the floor and flies - both fruit flies and the black ones were swarming around. What was crazy is that the place wasn't even busy. We were the only ones in the restaurant at 12:30pm.   The waitress/owner? that greeted us just sat behind the cash register and never lifted a finger to clean up all the dirty tables. The place smelled, the napkins at our table looked used and the bowls had a film of grease on it. As i cast my gaze towards the kitchen, I spotted the trolley of used dishes and yes ... They were full of dirty dishes with old food in the them.   The lack of cleanliness made us quite doubtful of the kitchen and food preparation. We decided to order ... and made a bad mistake of not leaving immediately.   Mr. Guo's menu is humongous with many traditional Chinese dishes. The problem is that the spelling in the menu is horrendous and not descriptive of what you're actually going to get (unless you read Chinese). The waitress/owner was no help as her English was quite poor.   Our congee came out in a slimy consistency. Even worse, it had the residual taste of mutton (also on the menu). I suspect cross contamination with uncleaned pots and cooking utensils. Congee with the musky taste of mutton ... is just disgusting.   The spicey beef dish was passable but was loaded with MSG. The only thing that was remotely decent was the steamed buns with condense milk.   Folks - we're banning this place. What a waste of money and time. Establishments like this should not even be allowed to open. We were totally disgusted with the experience."}
{"text":"Decided to give Mr. Guo's Caf√©.  This new Chinese restaurant specializes in the hot & spicy as in Hunan, Szechuan and the less spicy as in Guangdong (Cantonese).  We sampled some of their less spicy fare.  We ordered the following: No. 133 - Fried Green Beans w Minced Pork - quite good and not too greasy; lots of little baby dried shrimp that adds a lot of flavor to this dish!  No. 73 - Tea Smoked Duck - Wow!  This dish is so tasty.  Need some plum sauce and hot chili oil and it's all good!  The meat is pink in color but it is cooked thoroughly. No. 66 - Fish Fillet w Tofu - denoted with 2 chili peppers - interesting gravy poured over the fish fillets and pieces of soft tofu.  Not too spicy. Rice  We were the first at the restaurant and I think, they were surprised to see us there so early!    We'll be back to try their Peking Duck and their more spicy fare.  They also have the more adventurous dishes like pig ears and Brittle Pepper Spicy Crab!"}
