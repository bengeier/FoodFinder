{"text":"I love coffee shops (without a bunch of artificial flavors or as I would call them \"syrups\") and this is one of my favorites. Everyone is friendly. I sat on the back outdoor patio (they have a small front one) and I love the plants, shade (since it's 85 degrees) and the whole atmosphere. Importantly my black pour over was great along with the chocolate vegan croissant. Good way to start my day"}
{"text":"I love that some woman new to Yelp uploaded her profile pics as the business photos for this Phoenix location. I assure you the address is correct and it is not a 'god-blessed' field but in an old building on Bridge being turned into lofts (of course). Nitro toddy on draft here as well as a hopped iced tea. No drip coffee!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, the coffee is excellent and the surroundings are clean, comfortable and inviting.  Normally I stop in to buy beans but if I have the time I'll stick around for a pour-over coffee and a sea salt bagel.  Parking can be tricky but I've never had to park too far away.  This is the model of what a neighborhood coffee bar should be."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite coffee spot in Cleveland. The staff is very friendly and efficient and the coffee is absolutely delicious. I have yet to find a brew that was not delicious. They have great taste in music and the decor is super cool."}
{"text":"Everyone's reviews mention how friendly the staff is. I tend to disagree, and for one reason only. When I approached the counter to say I wanted a cup of coffee, rather than just ask me what type of coffee I like or describing what coffee they do offer, he hands me a menu and tells me to let him when I'm ready. I'm not sure about the rest of you who said the staff was so friendly, but I find that to be very poor customer service. I can understand if they have several choices that are too numerous to describe. But you have only three options. Stop being so lazy and talk to your customer and guide him to what he is asking for.  The second reason I wasn't happy with this place is that rather than quietly notify a customer that his coffee is ready, they scream at the top of their lungs to announce the next item. This happens once every 2-3 minutes. That method is fine when the seating area is sonewhat separated from the counter, but not when the place is so small you hear someone's order being called out every couple minutes. I felt like I was at the Waffle House. This is certainly not the place to go to relax nor a place conducive to working alone on your laptop unless you have headphones.  (Actually, when I looked around, every single person who was sitting alone was wearing them. Now I know why.)  And lastly, the ball of long black hair laying on the counter across the menu was a big turn off. Had I seen that before I ordered, I would have left."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome tea menu.   Oh, and the coffee is on point as well.  Cool ambiance... I want that tall table for my apartment."}
{"text":"Insert all the positive things one could say about a coffee shop here.   The coffee is great. The space is terrific. The staff is friendly. The location is ideal. The pasties are tasty. The music is fab.   All in all, a great, great coffee shop."}
{"text":"Make sure you stand in front of your pour over and stake your claim  so they don't give it to the pushiest person in line.  Your 3 minute pour over turns into 6 minutes.  No fun."}
{"text":"Very happy to see this place open up less than a block away from our place! Very well appointed, nicely decorated. I've never seen more precision and straight up desire in making you a cup of coffee. They weigh the exact amount of coffee grains that are used to new each cup and only grind those when you order it. Then they set the cup on a digital balance to ensure that they get the exact ratio of water to coffee. They were also very attentive to give me a cup of sparkling water. So while a cup of coffee is $3, they work for every single cent and its delocious! The pastries may be simple, but also good. This cafe is going to be a great part of what's looking to be a great building. You could spend a while in there. Go try them."}
{"text":"Great ambiance...good coffee. I had a pour-over. I'm a fan of lighter, fruitier coffees and asked for a recommendation in light of that...the recommendation was confidently given (which I like) and the team behind the counter was stellar. The coffee was decent, but nothing special on this occasion. I hope to be back.  Hopefully better luck with the coffee next time."}
{"text":"The red tea latte was perfect. It had the right amount of sweetness, not overpowering while still being noticeable.   Both baristas working there - a girl with shoulder length blond hair and a guy with round glasses and brown hair - were very personable, and not hipster-haughty (a very real problem in Raleigh, from where I hail).    Very cute place, with a nice ambiance. Will definitely stop by here again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in Ohio City located one block from St. Ignatius High School. Good place to plug in to get a little work done while enjoying a delicious latte or cappuccino. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly, super super cute on this inside, new favorite homework spot"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee art! Had a gingersnap almond milk latte & it was amazing! The staff was very helpful & nice- I also like that they make some of their syrups esp gingersnap! They keep baked goods from Bonbon which is also a plus. Will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure Phoenix is everyone's go to spot in Ohio City/Cleveland - hipster or non hipster included says a lot. I'm all about vibes and the vibes in this place makes you just want to spend your entire afternoon here. There selection of vinyls are pretty impressive, as well as their dessert choices. The workers are always great. And their back patio is my favorite. It was one of my favorite spots to sit in the summer to drink coffee and read in the sun. I usually get the Nigerian coffee but I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed with any of their selection of pour overs."}
{"text":"Yummy ginger latte and traditional chocolate! To top it all off, I received awesome recommendations and great customer service from the beared guy behind the coffee bar. My only compliant is the parking. I had to circle around the block a couple of times to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Phoenix Coffee Bar is located in Lakewood, Ohio and I find it to be quite inviting and relaxing.  Every Monday they have sing along with Mike and Jack.  It is great to sit back and relax with my favorite latte and listen to the songs that are sung to the sound of guitars.  You can even join in and sing!!!   I love this place as it is small and quaint.  I find it a place to go and sip on my latte and relax, have conversation with friends and even listen to some great music!!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. I'm in town visiting from Chicago and I told them what I preferred and the guy there selected an awesome brew. They do pour overs, which I love as well. Nice spot to sit and read or work as well."}
{"text":"5 stars but I hate this place b/c the homemade cookies are to die for.  Stay away from sweets and carbs, screw that.  Plus the whole area and feel is awesome."}
{"text":"New coffee shops are my favorite to check out! With that being said, I am glad to have stopped at this one after a trip to the zoo. I didn't get to stay long but I really liked the atmosphere, simple drink menu & selection of desserts. I had a double brown sugar cappuccino which was pretty comparable to any other I've had but didn't disappoint. I will say customer service could've been better but it wasn't terrible. All in all I liked it and if I go back I would love to try Lavender Lemonade."}
{"text":"A cute place! I met a friend here and was happy this is where she suggested.   I got an iced peppermint tea and loved that they freshly brewed it. It Is such a small thing that makes a huge difference and a lot of people don't fresh brew.   There are staple coffees here as well if you need your caffeine fix.   There are also some treats so you can truly enjoy the experience.   There is seating inside so you can be cozy. There is also a nice deck outside.   Overall, a great place to come for a drink and a treat."}
{"text":"Phoenix is by far my favorite coffee shop in Cleveland. There are four locations. All of the locations offer vegan alternatives using soy or almond milk. Most locations also carry vegan treats as well!  The baristas know what they are doing, and most have perfected latte art! A simply perfect pick me up!  Phoenix will always make my Top 10 vegan-friendly places in Cleveland. http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"Phoenix coffee makes me happy.  I love this little shop even if the parking is not as easy as a suburb shop.  The service is always great and I think the one employee even remembers me when I come in.  (This isn't a huge deal to me, but it is nice to know that among the myriad of faces one sees I do get remembered.)  I'm a simple, picky, coffee drinker.  I love my coffee good and I love my coffee black.  What I appreciate about this place is that the coffee is always good and that if I want a little cream, I can ask for it and they happily present it to me.  Also, they have locally sourced almond milk if you can't handle the dairy....another thing I appreciate.  They make delicious espresso beverages as well.  You really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu  The artwork is eclectic and local.  (Read; not always good or to my taste, but YAY for supporting the local artist.)  The atmosphere is great, spacious, airy, and bright.  I love the long table in the middle where you can park under the Edison light bulbs.  Because Phoenix is located in a multi-purpose space, you have to trek downstairs to use the joint toilet for the building...not my favorite thing to do, but hey, for the yummy java, I'll be okay with this.  Go there."}
{"text":"One time I came in here and was all frazzled and I yelled \"I LOST MY COFFEE\" and everyone stopped what they were doing and looked really concerned, even the dogs, and then I yelled \"....IN MY TUMMY\" and everyone laughed, again, even the dogs too; and for one day I felt like a really special guy and this is just how Phoenix can make a person feel because everyone that works here is really nice (especially Davey) and they let dogs come in too. They probably would let you bring a cat in I just haven't seen it yet.  Don't quote me on that."}
{"text":"Good coffee, chill atmosphere, and awesome staff."}
{"text":"Delicious coffees and teas and the friendliest staff you'll find anywhere. That's really all there is too it. Everything I've tried on the menu is awesome. I usually go with an iced tea or regular coffee, and I just tried their nitro toddy for the first time...deeeeelicious. Its a great place to grab coffee to go, or to hang out inside or on one of their two patios. Also love that there's a least one dog in there at any given time. Seriously, some of the best coffee in the city...if not the best."}
{"text":"Great variation of a local coffee and tea bar that roasts their own beans. This review is mostly about the tea + pastries -- I'm growing more sensitive to coffee as I get older. Sigh. I've been coming here for a few weeks and forming my opinion.   Phoenix is located on floor 1.5/2 of the old West Side Community House, which has since moved further west. It's three blocks from W 25th, 2 from the library/Momocho/Le Petit. The building itself is great stock but has been fallow for several years. A developer recently invested in it and the WSCH is currently being transformed into rental units! So great to see these great buildings be rehabbed.  About the space... they have two patios - one out front that is on a raised platform via stair (must be from the 70s, ha) and another in the back. Great for summer and fall days. The inside is pretty clean/trendy/modern. They have a few outlets if you want to stay and bring your portable electronics.   About the tea... This is definitely different than the Phoenix I'm used to, which is the location on Coventry. That location has your $1.75-2 teas and coffees and mixed drinks. This definitely has more tailored and refined preparation techniques (\"third wave coffee\") with single cup pour over and brewed tea (Cleveland Tea Revival leaves.) Expect to pay $3.50-4 per cup. I went when it first opened and I got a green tea in a single small cup, but it wasn't quite brewed strongly enough (gotta have my Asian teas strong! that almost bitter taste. No sugar/honey/cream either), so the next time I went I asked for a stronger brew. The barista offered to save my leaves for a 2nd cup brew, which is definitely much better value.   Unique finds... They also have some unique teas like the hops infused iced tea. Got it once to treat myself.   As for the pastries... pretty good, all local bakeries. They also carry the local hemp coconut bars that are ubiquitous to all Phoenix locations. After many years of wondering, I finally tried it and it was pretty good.  As for the overall atmosphere, the baristas are friendly, and it's a place you can go to stay for a while.   There's something about it that makes me feel uncomfortable. Ohio City has been on the gentrification train for many decades now, and that train is not stopping. I have a few more thoughts on this but I will spare the social commentary. I have to say that as a consumer, I'm happy that Phoenix is here - totally walkable for Ohio City residents and a great option, and they do a great job at coffee/tea."}
{"text":"It is so easy - and so fun - to laugh at hipstery coffee shops.  But deep down - or maybe not so deep - we must acknowledge that our laughter is very loving, for these places are always the coolest and most relaxing hangouts.  Walking into Phoenix feels almost like what a movie set of a hipster coffee shop might be like in a film 20 years from now looking back on the millennial generation.  Clean and modern yet with a retro, industrial feel - cool lighting fixtures, exposed ductwork, an accent wall covered by shiny bronze tiles.   A tattooed, bearded graphic designer works on his laptop to the left.  A girl on the right reads a yoga book while taking notes on a brown paper lunch bag (very original).  Barista #1 rocks the \"early Beach Boys\" hipster look with clean haircut and tan striped 1960's sweater; Barista #2 rocks the \"Shel Silverstein\" hipster look, with a \"Where the Wild Things Are\" untamed hairdo.  A Stan Getz album plays from the record player (of course) in the corner, where two twenty-somethings have a \"What is thuh de-al with ____?\" conversation, imagining themselves as Seinfeld characters.    The offerings at Phoenix are a dream come true on a lazy winter Saturday.  A simplified, streamlined menu board lists a few well-selected classic espresso drinks; you won't find the usual mumbo-jumbo of syrupy inventions and blended drinks.   A pile of baked delights awaits at the counter: beautiful seed-covered bagels that glisten as though just boiled, humongous fresh, chunky cookies, and delectable looking muffins of different sorts.     The espresso I had was strong, smooth, and creamy, but the true buzz was the addictive atmosphere in the room that invites one to sit and stay for a while and plan a career move that would allow you to work at home more."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee experiences in Cleveland. These guys know their coffee, and helped guide me through the selections. They offer the most delicious vegan pastries I've ever had; get the cinnamon roll. The space is nicely designed with some cool industrial touches. A great place to hang."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite hidden gem of Ohio city, well hidden for me. It's right off bridge avenue, quiet and quaint, good coffee, relaxing atmosphere, it's close to the library so I grab a cup and go! Highly recommended. Bright & spacious, plenty of seating. The earl tea is amazing, their dirty chai is okay, a bit too strong for my taste. Overall I was pleased!"}
{"text":"Nitro? Coffee? with a beer like texture? What is this dark magic? If you ilke iced coffee, and you like beer, you need to try it. The coffee was a bit bitter for my taste, but it was certainly interesting. Other than that, the coffee is good, there's WiFi, not much else to say."}
{"text":"4.9 Stars for this shop. Great coffee, great staff, clean design with some local decor flavor.  So just remember if your friends really like you they will give you the bird. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a good option for a cup of coffee, convenient to Ohio City. I've been there a couple times and have always loved the coffee.  The service has been middling, but I'm often there to read, not make friends so I haven't been bothered by it. I do find it awkward that they allow people to bring their dogs IN the store.  Seems a bit unsanitary and unfortunately not all dog owners are careful about minding their dogs while in the store.  I have several times been sniffed and such by a dog that's not being watched carefully enough.  Maybe I'm being  a killjoy, but I know the things dogs like to eat sometimes!  I know this from actually owning a dog (who I've never brought in Phoenix)."}
{"text":"Coffee was good not too pricey but they can do a little better on their iced coffee, tasted more like water then anything else."}
{"text":"This place is great! I bet it's even better in the summer. I can't believe I haven't been here but I'm so glad I've found it now. The decorations are home-y, cozy and beautiful. There's a good amount of seating, especially with the large table. The patio looks great. The baristas are super friendly. I'm super excited to have found this place and will be studying here often now! Obviously the downside of it being so awesome was that it is very busy, at least when I went, and can be distracting for studying. The music was a little bit loud as well. That won't stop me from going though, I'll just have some earplugs in when I'm studying!"}
{"text":"Simply the best coffee around, with the absolute friendliest staff possible.  Try a cappuccino, it's delish, and you'll experience some groovy latte art as well.  Prices are totally reasonable too.  Lots of seating areas allow for work/study time, and they have a tap that dispenses seltzer water!"}
{"text":"This was my second time that I visited Phoenix coffee and I decided to write this review. To be honest with you, I do not feel that I agree with a 4.5 stars rating for this coffee place. It is,however, important to mention that I usually go to coffee shop for study and I am a person who tend to value on the experience more than the coffee itself as I am not a sophisticated coffee drinker. My review for Phoenix coffee is therefore mainly about my experience at Phoenix coffee more than the coffee served here. My 3 stars review for Phoenix coffee came from the following aspects.  People: 2 stars I do not feel the friendliness of the staffs here both time I visited. The same lady who took my order from my both visits was not very friendly at all. She is so short and has some attitude. The first time I visited, I told her that it was my first time here. Instead of greeting me and telling me to take my time looking through their coffee menu or giving me some info about their menu, she just handed me the menu and was just standing there silently behind the counter and made me feel like she needed an order 10 seconds later. Forgot to mention that there was no one waiting behind me. Anyway, I do not really feel welcomed here both time I visited, not sure it was because I am a minority or that staff lady was just an unhappy person. The friendliness and courtesy of staff here is probably the major reason that turn down my experience here.    Place: 3.5 stars 1) Parking 3 stars - Parking is not very convenient since the parking lot next to the coffee shop is technically assigned for people who live in the building where the coffee shop is located. If you just stop to get a to-go coffee and leave, you can park at the parking lot. However, if you plan to get coffee and hang out there for a bit, you must find a street parking which is not easy to find.  2) Space 4 stars - There are plenty spot that you can sit and hang out here. I love the bar and the big, center table which provides a number of seats for people to sit down and work. The restrooms downstairs are clean and available which is nice.The cleanliness and maintenance of the place itself, however, need some attentions. There are a lot of dust around the window area where the planters were put on. People should feel refresh and pleasant when sitting around that corner instead of feeling down when seeing dust and dry leaves around the window area. The other corner of the coffee shop nearby the cream-and-sugar shelf where two tall tables are also looks messy, old, run down and not clean.   Product and Price: 3 stars I ordered a 12 oz brewed coffee and I got a mug which doesn't seem to give me 12 oz. I pay $3 for a VERY small amount of coffee and it just tastes very average to me. So, for the price I paid and what I got, I do not feel it worth my money much.   P.S. The options for tipping are also another thing I really don't like about this place. You cannot adjust the tipping amount if you pay by credit card. You have only three options for tipping amount to choose from starting from $1. It was not a pleasant feeling to feel that you are forced to tip the amount that the business think it is a minimum tipping amount, which to me it is not, especially with such an attitude that I got from the staff. It is right that $1 is not a big deal, but think about it $1 tipping for $3 coffee, that is basically 33.33% tip!!! When you go to the restaurant, will you pay 33% tip to a server who is not very friendly and does not make you feel that she appreciate your business?!?!   Anyway, I'm sorry if this review may discourage someone who've never been at Phoenix coffee. Please don't feel that way. People can incorporate things that happened differently. And, like I said, my review for Phoenix coffee is mainly about the service experience more than the coffee experience. Just try it yourself and see how do you think."}
{"text":"Great coffee,terrible music... Definitely your hipster headquarters for coffee in Cleveland, but with that said,they beat the competition easily."}
{"text":"My iced latte with almond milk and vanilla was a disappointment. I think it was made with cold brew and not with actual espresso so it was watery and weak. I would definitely clarify when ordering but I don't think I will go out of my way to go here again.  The outdoor patio was adorable and looked like a nice place to relax and chat with friends!"}
{"text":"If you got to anyone Phoenix Coffee shop you will always be greeted with a smile. If you have never been the the board over head and the menu are to confusing a barrista will surely take the time to give you some clarity as well as help you get to the flavors and taste you're looking for, the pastries are prepared in house, my favorite are the cranberry apple cookies, the macaroons and the lemon squares. With a seasonal drink menu, and various locations in different locations in some awesome neighborhoods, stop in grab a cup of something get some work done or go for a walk around the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to rest and drink excellent beverages.  They have almond milk.  And their restrooms are GENDER NEUTRAL.  good job, Cleveland."}
{"text":"THE BEST CAPPUCCINO'S IN TOWN! I wish they came in a larger size. Made the Italian way and always delicious and on spot.  I also find the space interesting and people are always mingling around, but never too crowded.   The industrial decorations are always intriguing and I end up wanting to duplicate things I see in my own place."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and the coffee is good, with a lot more options to choose from. The servers are good at paying attention to detail and making the drink you asked for. I come here sometimes for meetings or to get work done privately.  There is usually a quiet space to focus and nobody bothers you.  If you are in Ohio City and looking for a caffeine cup this is a great pick!"}
{"text":"Sorry--I'm a Phoenix Coffee fan through and through. I'm probably biased, so you can skip my review if you want.   This new location is going to be awesome--it's already almost there. I think once the construction of the building is fully done and the cafe is settled in, you'll start to feel the oh-so-familiar Phoenix comfort we've all become accustomed to.   I stopped in on a hot summer day and not even the sounds of pounding nails and running drills could damper the deliciousness of their Toddy, served over ice off a tap like a stout! While they were having some issues with the pressure of the tap, the nicest barista ever brought out my beverage and offered me a free muffin for my patience. Quality products and killer customer service have always been the name of the game at Phoenix and this new location sings that tune so well. And, per usual, that Toddy was smooth as silk, so delicious. I'm into fancy coffee beans and roasting techniques, but no one does a smoother coffee than Phoenix, IMHO.  I love the patio--although when I was there, it was sitting on top of a dug-up mess with a port-o-pot to boot. Like I said, still lots of construction on the building, but don't let that keep you away.   I can't wait to come back in the cooler months for working, meetings and just pure enjoyment of their delicious brews."}
{"text":"I had my first visit to Phoenix the other day and have a delicious latte. I went to get out of the house and do some homework, only downfall was that a lot of people had the same idea and like most coffee shops it's kind of small and there were not many tables. There's a cute patio with more tables and would love to go back in the summer to check it out. Overall though I had a good experience and would go back and recommend"}
{"text":"Great location!  Coffee is good; knowledgable coffee staff.  Space for laptops if needed (which I do).  Coffee is fantastic.  Off the beaten path too, so not crowded."}
{"text":"Such a relief to find a coffee shop that serves iced toddy..... already cold. Not hot poured over ice. I didn't order an Americano. Same w/ the Mocha selection. Atmosphere was very pleasant as staff was as well. I did not try a pastry or anything but will the next time I am there"}
{"text":"Loved this coffee shop in Ohio City! They a really cool shop in what looks to be an old library building. Great coffee and they had Cleveland Bagel company bagels and spreads which were delicious! If you're in Ohio City and need some caffeine make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"Really great, casual place. Nice vibes and music (with a collection of vinyl in one corner). I had the earl grey and the jasmine teas, both of which were prepared perfectly. They had a good selection of pastries which I sadly didn't get to try. They have a great patio area out back which is perfect for summer lounging/grabbing coffee or tea while with a dog. Everyone I was with enjoyed their order. Would return!"}
{"text":"Terrific staff. Great coffee. Place is always packed. Nice little porch out back. Dog friendly. Snags CLE bagels if you're looking for a snack. Actually like this place more than Rising Star down the street - that place is kinda boring and underdecorated. PHX has a way better vibe to it."}
{"text":"Nice menu and selection, but the coffee had quiet a few defects.   The nitro toddy had a noticeable green vegetable note, not terribly great.    I had the Ethiopian espresso, and it looked nice.   A bit short of a pull so it had a very tart note that hid all the berry notes.  Drip / pour over coffee was the best and this is what I would get if I came back.   Parking is mostly street and can be a challenge"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good music, good seating, good patio and good wi-fi. Basically everything I want from a coffee place. They even had an entire Joanna Newsom album playing the last time I was in, which, at least for me, secured their status as the Ohio City hipster coffee shop of choice."}
{"text":"I prefer a sweeter chai. Theirs has more of a spice kick to it. A nice study area. Seems to be a lot of students. I came here to get some work done and felt it was a productive environment."}
{"text":"The Phoenix is the best coffee shop in the area, tucked away in the heart of Ohio City. My go to is their \"Nitro Toddy\" (which is not for the caffeine sensitive!). The cheap prices, trendy appearance and happy employees make the Phoenix the type of place you want to return to. They have a rewards program that automatically keeps track of your reward status through your credit card which is super convenient. Basically every 10 drinks gets you a drink worth up to $5(ish). You will see a lot of familiar Ohio City faces meeting here and a lot of regulars who use the shop to work off their laptops. I believe they are dog friendly and have a very cool little patio. Stop in and check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this little coffee shop was here until today. Nice relaxing atmosphere with an excellent drink! Service was nice and helpful. Most importantly it's doggie friendly."}
{"text":"Phoenix is my happy place. This local coffee shop achieves the perfect balance of character, creativity and neighborhood vibes.   HOLY PATIO. If you're looking for a spacious, inviting patio to grab a drink with friends, have a super cozy first date, or just to do work, this is your place. I could sit out here for hours with a book. It's the chicest, minimalist city patio any coffee or tea lover could ask for.  The interior has surprisingly robust seating for a small place. There are a few high tops, bar seating and some small arm chairs. You can cozy up against the record player or join the community table with cute terrariums. I swear to god, the last time I was here, a communal sing-out to Fleetwood Mac's \"Go Your Own Way\" randomly happened out of nowhere. THESE ARE MY PEOPLE.  I love Phoenix for their tremendous tea options, particularly as someone who is only * trying * to start to like fancy coffee. In general, I find that the people who gather here are super interesting creatives, intellectual and neighborhood folk who are generally respectful of the shared atmosphere. It's so distinctly lovable and Ohio City. When I'm sitting here, I'm completely energized. It also makes me want to become a novelist. I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"A+++ place. Their signage isn't great, & I don't know why my expectations were so low, but I guess I just... didn't expect this to be what it is. Phoenix Coffee is a great space - bright & spacious, with plenty of seating, a chill atmosphere, quirky decor, friendly baristas, & a decidedly hipster clientele. Their menu is simple, & they only serve a few pastries, but everything seems to be good. The Earl grey tea is some of the best I've had, their homemade dirty chai was strong but not too sweet, their iced tea is light & summery.  Definitely give this place a shot, especially if you're in Ohio City & looking for a place to hang out with your laptop or a friend for an hour or two."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  I met a friend here to grab coffee and a scone before work. The place is super cute and clean inside, the help is fantastic, and the coffee came out in a jiffy. We sat outside at their patio area and watched the cars and people pass by while we sipped and grubbed.  It's a quality coffee. I orderd the pour over and it hit the spot. I like the location and ambiance more than the coffee though. It's a cool place located conveniently downtown, so it's easy to meet others there for a quick coffee break. The help is always great. The patio area is so nice and worth a hang out.   Convenient. Great vibes. Good coffee."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I was always under the impression that Phoenix wasn't so great, due mainly to some pictures I'd seen which did not please my snobbish tastes. But it appears like in recent years they have embraced the third wave movement full force. I was impressed. This will now be another destination every time I'm in Cleveland.   It was pleasant, very pleasant. Trendy and warm, all in one. The cafe is a bit elevated with a nice patio out back overlooking, Oh the wonderful beauties of nature!... Ok I guess it's just someone's backyard. They have a beautiful La Marzocco which I'm assuming pumps out equally beautiful shots. I got my usual pour-over, this time in Nicaraguan form. It was acceptable, nothing outstanding but quite acceptable. And the baristas were warm in spirit and trendy in appearance (massive hair and beards) which is also quite acceptable.   Oh and by the way, Ohio City, what is wrong with you? It seems like every time I walk on to your premises I am compelled with something of an obsession to stuff every inward nook with the food and liquids that are being held before me. This particular moment I was faced with a decision between a pour-over and kombucha. I chose both. Then I was forced to walk along the sidewalk with both hands clutching beverages, thus being frozen solid and rendered useless in the event of an emergency. Deja vu, it seems like I did this once before: (that time it involved Rising Star and Cleveland Tea Revival.)  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bright September; And each separate living member of my limbs had drinks in hand.  The day before, I'd wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow  From my hometown surcease of sorrow-sorrow for my absence from Cleveland- For the rare and radiant city which the hipsters name Cleveland- Nameless here forevermore-land.  *ahem* That impression didn't work so well, did it. Anyways, unlike Edgar Allen Poe, I survived. Both times."}
{"text":"Awesome! Glad there is a shop in Ohio City!!! I like the speedball and it comes deracinated if you don't need the jolt in the evening.  Its a relaxing place and don't forget you can bring your own coffee cup for a discount!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee spot to sit around and do some work, read a book, or just enjoy a quality cup of coffee.  Normal coffee here is great, not too strong but it weak/watery in the slightest. Lots of options to choose from too - either a quick cup from the drip, or wait a little bit and enjoy a pour over. Decently priced when compared to other local coffee places. The cold brew is amazing! It is incredibly smooth and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's so cute, always so welcoming, I go at least twice a week for a quick fix or a first date. #coffeelover"}
{"text":"My fav location of Phoenix. It's cozy, charming, has ample outdoor space, and there's tons of free street parking nearby. Also, housemade almond milk and baristas who know what they're doing. Also super cute decor, tons of power outlets around, dog-friendly, and to top it all off, a record player. This space has great, local, and homey vibes, and makes me proud to be a Clevelander."}
{"text":"first off ok this place is so super cute but I wish they offered other milk subs like soy or coconut milk! almond milk in coffee is such a bummer... and i don't drink regular milk so i had to get tea :( first world probs though"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of a quality coffee shop.  I moved from Cleveland Heights to Ohio City recently.  I liked Phoenix coffee in Coventry, but it was a little too busy, and a little too young.  The new Phoenix coffee in Ohio City is such a pleasant surprise.  First off, the espresso is phenomenal.  I absolutely love getting a Cortado (espresso w/milk).  The coffee is very smooth, and it doesn't have that Starbucks bitterness.    Secondly, the staff here is always friendly.  One thing about niche coffee shops is that they tend to become a little snobby, but everyone who I have encountered at Phoenix Coffee have been very kind.  They seem like a great group of people, that really enjoy what they do!  Third, the ambiance is fantastic.  I find it great for working.  There is a ton of table space, and it is loud, but not distracting.  The patio is great in the summer and I love when people bring dogs to the shop.  Overall, great experiences.  I'll be a long term customer, at least for as long as I live nearby!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a cute and cozy set up with a friendly but very relaxed vibe. I adore there lattes, they are so delicious. I definitely recommend this place to anybody who loves coffee  and anyone who wants a nice place to study, talk, or hangout. ALSO check out the back patio! so cute!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool.  They allow dogs, have records and a record player.  Enough space to set up to study or do work and enough outlets to match.  2 coffees and 2 muffins were $10 to give you an idea on price.  It's pretty fancy coffee, so I think it's worth it if you're a coffee snob like me.  The coffee is pour over and a certain measured amount, your not going to get full cup though, so just be prepared.  They have Cleveland Bagels and the accompanying spread!!! Score!"}
{"text":"I've had a mixed experience. Sometimes I love it, but lately I just feel alienated and disappointed. You might wait in line half an hour and then a regular comes in and you might have to wait even longer... because they serve people they like first. It sends a message that they don't like you. And then you wonder why you even bother. The place fills up with live dogs on weekends and if it's rainy, well, it smells like wet dog. And some of the employees crank up the sound until everyone in the coffee house has to shout to be heard and the noise is disharmoniously jarring. I've decided to give up on the place even though the latte's are evenly good. Quite delicious."}
{"text":"I just moved to Ohio City and was initially intrigued when I saw the sign out front that read \"meet cool people here,\" The sign was right.  Phoenix Coffee has a great vibe with authentic vinyl played at all times. The pour over coffee is the best around and the nitro stout is one of the most unique tasting coffee drinks I ever had. I definitely found my staple coffee shop."}
{"text":"They just opened. You can't see it off the street, they say they are getting a sign. Phoenix Coffee is always at the top of my list. The atmosphere is relaxing, free WiFi, and this location is nice. Customer service is great.  Only problem I have is if you dine in its same price refills!!!! Starbucks charges .50 no matter the size.... c'mon phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time visit, staff learned of this and we got extra hellos and niceties. Great for summer or winter. Patio is dog friendly. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A nice variety of drinks and snacks. If you're rolling with a group, this is the best place in the neighborhood to find something for everyone.  If you're looking to work, there are plenty of tables and outlets. At the large community table, there are outlets underneath it, no need for a trip hazard. The dog watching here is great, especially on weekends. But if you aren't comfortable with dogs, you might not like this place."}
{"text":"They spin vinyl. Employees are so nice. Great wifi and place to work. Overall cool vibe. Coffee beans are delicious. I suggest pour overs. Also the outside deck is stellar."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at Phoenix Coffee. The speedball is to die for. The staff at Phoenix is amazing and they are the reason I continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Great little spot on west 30th and bridge in Ohio City. Really good pour over coffee and cafe cortados. Also have a good selections of pastries and other small breakfast type foods."}
{"text":"I've been to each of the Phoenix locations and this is a close favorite to the one on Coventry, and I love them both for completely different reasons. This is just what you want when a good cafe opens an additional location: uniqueness to each location. The interior is beautifully laid out with a gorgeous wood bar as you first walk in. The menu is simple and small which is one thing this location offers: very specific type of drink experience. The staff is soooooo friendly, which has been my experience at every single Phoenix location I have frequented. They are into creating a coffee culture and community. The ONLY thing I have to say that is my one bone about Phoenix, and it may seem small, but they don't use a local or hormone free milk to my knowledge. A couple other of my favorite joints (Rising Star, Pour, Root Cafe) use organic milk or the local hartzler milk. When making milk based drinks, I personally find milk quality to be almost as important as the roast ans grind if the espresso. With the amount of coffee i drink, I wanna make sure I'm.loading up on a few cups of milk that is healthy and humane. Just my own personal thought that would only add to the magnificence of Phoenix"}
{"text":"Growing up in Lakewood, I started hanging out drinking Phoenix coffee in high school. I was especially spoiled by the amazing toddy and iced mochas. When the Lakewood Phoenix owner opened her own independent cafe, she eventually changed roasters, and despite my best efforts I haven't been able to stop missing the Phoenix toddy. I'm ashamed to say I didn't know there was an Ohio City location! I only knew of downtown, and Coventry. I often drive way out of my way just to swing by those locations when I just need my Phoenix fix. When I stumbled upon the Yelp listing, I was super excited! No more driving to Coventry just for coffee. Best part is that they have a patio! They also have free wifi, so it's a great place to get things done. The baristas were super fun and friendly (genuinely, not the type that try to hard). I wish they stayed open a little later since I'm a night owl, but hey, not everything can revolve around me :)."}
{"text":"LOVE!  Perhaps I'm a little biased as this Phoenix is in my neighborhood, but I absolutely love this new Phoenix.  It's a lot different than the other Phoenixes- I had actually been a bit appalled by the others, due to their over sweet drinks and their lack of strong coffee, however, I was pretty impressed with this new addition to the neighborhood.  Phoenix was actually the first coffee shop I tried when I moved to CLE. I was a big fan of their cups and their designs. But their coffee? Meh. However, this new Phoenix does things differently- pour-overs, hops infused teas, nitro coffees (which are super smooth by the way), and lots of other items.  I've tried so many different drinks here- including their pumpkinless spice latte (try try! So tasty), and have been impressed and pleased with the real coffee taste as well as the wealth of tasty teas. I really don't like sugary coffees (I would rather have my coffee with just cream, no sugar), so I've been happy with all their coffees/iced teas/lattes/specialty drinks- they're superbly made and super tasty without the sugar overload.  The decor fits the Ohio City theme quite well- rustic, old school, with a cool little patio on the outside. Also, this Phoenix isn't full of college students- this is definitely a more hipster location which I like a lot. Plus, it's a lot quieter than other places- so I can have a decent convo or meeting.  There's lot of parking on Bridge or Jay Ave, so no need to fret about parking. The little pots of plants with the smiley faces are super cute too, as they just rest on their tables. So, if you're looking for a great pour-over coffee or great hops infused tea, or something of the like, hop on over to this new Phoenix in Ohio City- I'm sure they've got what you're craving!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in Cleveland. It's in a great neighborhood location that I can walk to. The patio is adorable and perfect for enjoying some fresh air in the city while sipping a delicious latte. Plus, they are dog friendly! I love dog friendly places! I was not allowed in another coffee shop in the neighborhood with my dogs, so Phoenix is a charm."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have amazing hot chocolate, coffee and treats that are always served by a friendly face. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I went on an urban hiking expedition with Young P during one of the last warm September days. We stopped in Phoenix Coffee Bar at the end of the journey. The interior was nice. They had some great drinks on draft that tasted like beer. There was a hop infused iced tea and a carbonated iced toddy. Both were refreshing and I recommend trying them for a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"I'll give them an A for effort. Coffee is really not that good, but their espresso was kick ass. They only have one size to go with a small menu. (Basics) There were a lot of locals, so they must be doing something right. Just wasn't to my liking."}
{"text":"Brightly lit interior with modern lights and lots of natural light, this coffee shop provides a nice spot to spend some time. The music when I went was all instrumental which was also nice and allowed for optimal concentration for me. A huge thick slab bench table is great for groups and many neat accents such give the space a unique over all design, such as a studded tin wall. There is also a patio with recycled pallets for some of the chairs. There is no parking however. The parking lot to the left is not for coffee shop guests - not even one spot of it. I had never frequented Phoenix before just because of where they were located, so I am excited for one in my neighborhood. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm a habitual coffee shop camper. I'll admit it. When I'm taking my coffee for the house, I'm taking it for the long run as well. Sometimes, this causes me to get annnoyed with coffee ships easily. However, for Phoenix, it made me fall in love.   I had simple things: a latte-- great tasting espresso  A mocha-- not the best mocha I've ever had, but that yummy espresso kept it in the top of mochas A salt bagel with cheddar chips cream cheese-- YUM why have I never had a salt bagel before.   The atmosphere is really what nailed it for me though. It's a great place to work or to meet up with a friend and chat. I adored the neighborhood vibe, and all of the cute dogs that people brought in were so well behaved and made my heart super happy.   The thing I loved the most about the atmosphere was the music. At first I didn't realize what was happening, but then I noticed that the music they were playing was from the record player. When one record was over, a barista would go switch out the record and display the sleeve in a special display place over the steamer. They had great taste! I loved what I heard.   It was pouring down rain when I went, but I also noticed they have a wonderful looking patio. Can't wait to go back and try it out!"}
{"text":"Nice light, airy atmosphere. Wouldn't mind hanging out on the patio in the summer. Parking sucked. Had to try and squeeze in on the street. Total non issue for neighbors in the area that stroll over for a great cup of joe. Ordered a large mocha. Fabbbbulous!!!This place will give a firehouse coffee shop a run for it's money. I think I'll bring my son that's my coffee buddy and we'll have a coffee taste off!!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I have no conflicts of interest other than seeking the best cup of coffee. Having lived in the Pacific Northwest, a cup of coffee is more of an experience than a caffeine dose for me. I was quite disappointed in the lack of ability for this coffee shop to handle a rush of customers. I was denied a pour over coffee because \"it would take 3 minutes and we have a line of customers\", and had to settle with an older, more acidic drip coffee for the same price instead. A coffee shop should be able to provide the type of coffee that a customer initially orders, regardless of the circumstance.  Of note, I was at Rising star in Hingetown earlier that day (Labor Day), and they were able to handle the rush of an entire cycling team along with my order for a pour over (which was brought to my table in a well-endowed pot).   I stopped recommending this place to friends and my company will be catering from Rising Star from now on. Maybe Phoenix coffee will improve, or maybe not."}
{"text":"Super hip coffee shop tucked away in the back of a building. Don't be fooled, it's definitely there! Just look for the phoenix logo if you find yourself lost our in doubt.  The staff is super friendly, and there are little succulent plants throughout the place. We tried an espresso and a regular coffee and both were perfect.  The outside patio is nice, and there's plenty of seating inside. Very quiet, so perfect for getting work or reading done.  If you're in the area, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Wow, best cappuccino ever!! Great atmosphere. Outside seating too! Hopefully you can climb the 8 or so steps to get in, well worth it."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for some weekend working on your laptop or even just a nice chat with a friend over a great cup of joe, here's your horse! I have never had anything besides a pleasant or productive experience here! I oftentimes get the bagels with an amazing and new random shmear (I've gone from cheddar and chive to dates and bacon... it's all delicious)!  The vibe is certainly feel good and the cost is reasonable. I spent like 6 bucks on breakfast and got to enjoy sipping my cappuccino which had an adorable design on it by the way.   Definitely check this place out if you're digging some caffeine in your life and want to feel stress free while you procure it!"}
{"text":"Was there this afternoon got a cute little cappuccino! Very lovely and trendy little place. Will definitely go back for a reading for one Sunday afternoon. Also very easy to park nearby and the neighborhood is nice to walk as well!"}
{"text":"The coffee was good the wait was a bit long, but only because we seemed to get there right after an entire yoga class. I recommend the Ethiopian Pour over."}
