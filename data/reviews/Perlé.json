{"text":"Eh. I'll say first that I'm a little biased- I've worked in Champagne lounges in NYC, Paris and San Diego so my experience with bubble bars is probably a bit more extensive that the average person. That being said, I was a little disappointed to walk in on a Saturday afternoon and feel like I was imposing on a not-yet-started party. Clearly this place does a good club/nightlife business, but I didn't get the impression that it was really the spot for a casual coupe de champagne. I'd like to have more options that just hanging out at the bar as it was obvious they were gearing up the floor and DJ for the night. The menu was ok- being that I seek out more obscure bubblies, I didn't really see much that peeked my interest. I will say that for the average drinker, I'm sure their menu was well equipped to please. I don't recommend this place for those looking for an indulgent, cozy lounge to enjoy a little bubbly. It was a little to \"club-like\" for that."}
{"text":"I can't figure or why the bouncer is staring at my feet when I walk in....creepy. But I enter. I get upstairs, and I wait...and wait some more....where's my husband? I go back downstairs and he is outside. The bouncer doesn't let him in because his low leather boots have white soles (so this explains the creepy bouncer's aparrent foot fetish)! They're not tennis shoes.... Not even close.....but quite expensive trendy boots. So what's the problem? When the hype wears off, you will not survive by alienating the folks who have the disposable income to support you over the long term. Get a grip......"}
{"text":"My bad experience stemmed from a bartender initially quoting us for a $60 bottle of rosé and then once the bill came, changing it to a $100 bottle. Continued to insist I was wrong while not being able to point to the correct bottle we bought on their list.   Additionally, the place is dead on a Friday night. It's not worth going to."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Went for a girls night all we got was sleazy men hanging around. Too packed and not real room to move. And the wait for a drink was ridiculous. Had one then left"}
{"text":"Went here after dinner with a few friends on a Friday night. I don't know a lot about champagne but the few drinks I had here were delicious. The atmosphere seem to lean to the older crowd (35-45).   The balcony has a great view of Market Square and part of downtown, the sax player there was a little strange and it has a dress code, which isn't too demanding but was happy to see, wish more places in Pittsburgh did. Defiantly coming back again"}
{"text":"So I went here for a co workers birthday party a few nights ago. I must say it's a very nice place. They have leather chairs and sofas all over the place. The lighting is very appropriate for what vibe they are trying to give off here. Drinks are a little expensive. But almost every person including myself was dressed up. Woman had dresses on and man wore suit jackets or dress shirts with ties. The door man wears a tux. The deserts are amazing that's all we had on there menu so I can't tell you much about there other food. The service was fantastic we had our own waiter who only was serving the birthday party. If you want to celebrate a promotion that you got from work or are going out on a date with someone you've been with for awhile I would definitely recommend this place. A lot of couples go here from what I saw so maybe not for someone who is single and I went on a Saturday but the place does get packed so you'll have fun regardless of who your with. They have a jacket check which is nice. Overall I will be going back o this place 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I moved from Pittsburgh to LA two years ago.  Therefore, I have very low expectations when it comes to bar and clubs in Pittsburgh.  I do have to say that Perle is a pretty cool spot in the heart of Market Square downtown.  I was visiting Pitt for the weekend and went here for a friends birthday.  I'm so used to $14 drinks now, so I was so excited to see $7-8 drinks on the menu.  The place is a champagne bar and that is what they specialize in, but they do have many other selections.  We had a couple of appetizers as well and they were great.  Fun vibe and not too small.  Most importantly, the service was fantastic!  Couldn't have asked for a more attentive staff."}
{"text":"I was told, prior to going, that this was a place where \"People dressed up to take selfies\".  Turns out, that was correct at 10pm on a Saturday night. There were a few other bachelorette parties there, but the place was surprisingly not very full.  The VIP section (we did not opt for it, $150 btl of champagne?  No.) really didn't seem that VIP, it looked like a couch in the open like where were were sitting (opposite side of large room).  Awesome part was that we were given complementary sangria, which was nearly sickly sweet. I loved it.  The music was good for dancing, but the environment there was slower than you'd expect on a Saturday night.  I think there were a total of 3 men in the place, who appeared to be there with female counterparts.  There is also a dress code, that is reasonable.  I am kicking myself I didn't check out the Speakeasy, which is straight through the main floor.  I was thankful that we were able to snag seating, so sitting and sipping sangria in heels was my kind of thing.  The bride wanted more upbeat with bodies actually dancing, so our time here was short-lived."}
{"text":"Interesting place, the drinks are good, one of the few lounges in pittsburgh.  Can't go wrong.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This 4 star rating is based off of past times here and my interaction with the general manager. If it had solely been on this visit it would have been a lot lower because of one reason - the music.   Ok, so after randomly stumbling across this place a couple of years ago it has become the go to spot for my friends and me. When the time came to chose a spot for my friends 30th birthday bash, Perlé was our obvious choice!   I got in contact with Sharon, the manager, about reserving a table for bottle service and she was absolutely fantastic. Planning for a party, especially as an out of towner, is never easy but she made it so great! We corresponded for a couple of weeks and she got us set up with what we wanted. Prices were what you'd expect for Pittsburgh bottle service, so we were happy and excited! Sharon even said we could bring in decorations (balloons, banners, photo booth props) and not only that but when we came to drop them off Sharon took everything and set it up for us so we could get to our dinner reservation! Above and beyond our expectations! She did an amazing job and made our night so special!  The only downside, however, was the music. Normally when we've been the DJ was fantastic and the place filled up with tons of people looking to dance...this time, though, you couldn't dance if you wanted to. It was an odd techno remix of every song that came on. It felt out of place. I'm sure it's great if you like that style, but it felt more like listening to someone who is practicing for a rave and not a DJ concerned with filling a bar or playing fun music to dance to. We couldn't dance at all which was pretty disappointing. We even saw a couple bachelorette parties leave because of it and the place never even filled up, making the need for bottle service in the fist place kind of obsolete. Hopefully the next time we go in the music is better, but if it isn't we might have to find a new go to spot.   Overall we still had fun, and the staff and management team was so accommodating it really helped us make the best of the night. We've seen how much fun we can have here so we'll be back for sure, but I'm hoping the music is better! I'd hate to lose this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that just opened in Market Square! I went with my family and we sampled a bit of everything:  the salmon three-ways, the ahi tartare, the ratatouille and California crepes. For dessert, we ended our meal with the banana foster crepe! It was all delicious! The food is very good, but the portions are on the smaller side which can make the it expensive.  I definitely look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is they have  cozy quieter speak easy type place in the back and then a more club lounge style atmosphere in the main bar. We went on a Saturday night and it was not super crowded and no cover to get in. The beer list is pretty good and very reasonably priced. You can also order wine and champagne with both cheaper and more expensive options. I ordered a Strongbow Cider and Abita Purple Haze. The bartenders are super friendly. If you sign up online for the VIP club you get a free drink. My biggest complaint was the DJ. It was a weird crowd to begin with and the music they were playing was terrible- the dance version of older songs from the 80s and 90s."}
{"text":"Well, Lauren beat me to the first... but i guess that happens when there is a invite-only soft open! And her review is pretty much spot on.   We had our monthly socializing happy hour for our industry here recently, and this place is pretty neat. My biggest concern is hardly a concern at all, simply a fact of the way the world works- I'm not sure they have hit their stride. Obviously, there is plenty of time for that.   Perle is an interesting little place. I don't know of any other Champagne bars in the city (that doesn't mean there aren't any) and where I can get annoyed by a place just \"branding\" themselves as a certain \"kind\" of bar, Perle is the real deal. They have some beers (good ones, I might add) in bottles, but tehy've left the taps for Champagne and other types of Bubbly. That is right- Sparkling White Wines FROM A TAP. You know how good a fresh tasty lager is from a insulated, clean tap? Imagine the dry crisp sparkle and joy of champagne, delivered by the same method. Are you imagining it? You're welcome.   Perle is on the second floor above Brueggers, and has a small Balcony that has become the talk of the square. I'm more impressed with the concept of the interior, myself. The windows are pained, vertically quite tall, and stretch near to the floor. This gives the feeling of the windows at Buckingham, or another gorgeous European city building.   The main space, had a clubby feel, and most intersting of all, is that all the furniture (club style arm chairs and curving sofas) are modular and on wheels. This allows the room to take on whatever setup is most conducive to the event and patronage in the space.   The staff was really nice, though some of them seem to be better at their jobs than others. I'll give this a pass as I am sure they are all still training and learning the ropes.   As mentioned above my biggest concern is Perle hitting it's stride. I thought a champagne bar would feel a little classsier. Perle has all dark (black?) seats and tables, on a very dark wooden floor, and there are LED lights on the wall, and accent lights under the indoor eaves. I am all for ambient lighting to set the environment you want, but these slowly pulsed and changed color while hip, kind of loud music played... it all just seemed a little \"clubby\". This is not what i would expect for a champagne bar.   I think Perle will find it's groove, and it's customer base. People are already all atwitter with talk of this place. The drinks are good, and the food is... well... tapas. Really trendy sort of tapas (we had \"s'mores\" sampled for us)- it's a little pricey, but it's not a yinzer bar, that is for sure.   I'd recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"The place was SWANK and the vibe is forming when you arrive at Perle.  Hip, fancy, timey take on a bar in DT Pitts. I really enjoyed the look of the entryway staff (bouncers); they were in character with the vibe the place seems to want to giveaway. But the female bartenders up in the champagne bar could use a bit of improvement in attire and still keep it comfy; just seemed very casual compared to the VIP staff and welcome staff. They were also kinda bickering w/ other staff members- big boo for mood killers but serviceable to CUstomers so that was a good comeback! The drinks were delicious. Prices are reasonable. I saw some champs by the glass that were minimally up-charged from original bottle price- ching ching win for guests.  The customers were interesting altogether. Some exuded clear pretentiousness while others fit well with a fashionable look and a mere intent to sip the bubbly and have a good time! Yea! I enjoyed the DJ spinning and smiling the great house mix, loungy music.  The décor is so pretty and chic! Loved the bar area and seating. We got complimentary small plates of chocolate covered strawberries. They have a cool balcony overlooking the square which is a pretty urban scape. It did seem as if the place is new?? so maybe a few more months and more promo could crank up the headcount. Hubby and I were perfectly fine with being able to sit at the bar and enjoy a bubbly cocktail before hitting our dinner reservation at 10pm Sat. They have a speakeasy that was closed for a reserved party later that night but I, of course, peeked behind the curtain and it looked cool.  Would love to have a spot like this in DT Cincy."}
{"text":"Wandered in after hearing some music pouring out of the door. Discovered it was Latin music night. Looked to be mostly a group of students and teachers, but we thought why not let's jump in. Ended up having a whole a lot of fun, enjoying a few dances and some great drinks from the bartenders. Always fun to see what twist can be thrown your way down in Market Square!"}
{"text":"When I walk in the door, Perle' has my Bellini  ready.   All the bartenders go out of their way to chat ya up and educate you about the various menu offerings. I have never met a more caring bar staff.    Bonus Perle's happy hours is from 5:00-8:00 pm!!! 2 dollars off champagne cocktails and $1 tapas.  Even if the last time you had champagne was at your brother's wedding or New Years Eve, go in and try a champagne cocktail , you might find out your really do like it!"}
{"text":"I was visiting here from out of town for a wedding and the bouncer would not let us in for open toed shoes. We contested the issue and were still not granted entrance. Avoid even attempting to go to this bar."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. I have never been to a Champagne Bar and had no idea what to expect. When we arrived, we realized we were a little under dressed, so I would be cautious of that when you plan your visit. The dance floor was pretty big and they played great music. I loved their Champagne Mojito- it was a twist on a classic drink and was really good. My boyfriend doesn't drink Champagne, but he was able to get another drink at the bar. It is a little on the pricey side, so I would just be prepared for that before you visit. Overall, for a special occasion- we had a great time."}
{"text":"I went here for a work holiday party.  We had rented out the whole space, so I can't comment like the below people did on the normal crowd or decor, but for a holiday party, it was awfully nice.   They had waiters walking around with appetizers as well as a table stuffed full of interesting items - chicken curry and date kabobs, black bean dip on homemade tortilla chips, pot roast brushetta (a personal favorite), tiny crab cakes which were very tasty and scallops which were the worst of all the things I tasted.  They were definitely frozen and kind of cold.   Of the champagne cocktails, I had two and was really pleased.  I had the Perle 75 which is served with St Germain's elderflower liquor, gin, cucumber, lemon and champagne.  It was refreshing and I don't say that I am a gin drinker.  The other was the Rose Bud - st germain's again, grapefruit juice and rose champagne.  It was very pretty and very tasty.    It's not the type of place that I would normally go - I am more of a beer drinker or a classic cocktail - but it was interesting.  I kept checking out the LED's that people seemed very bothered by in other reviews.  Personally, I thought they were festive.  There were also circles of LED's on the ceiling that were very pleasing.  And like most of the other reviews, the wait staff was immensely attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"Very neat place to visit and drink but is very expensive. The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is very friendly. When they were closed they invited us to come back for a free drink which we very much appreciated. They do offer other things besides champagne for those who don't like it."}
{"text":"Will not be back. Had two champagne cocktails which were very mediocre. The type of champagne wasn't even listed on the menu - cant imagine it was anything worthwhile. What tipped me off at first to the atmosphere was the carpetted steps going to the bar. More carpet at the space at the front of the bar. Moving in, the group of 5 I was with found ourselves standing in the middle of what may possibly been intended as a dance floor - this was at aboun10 pm - but no one was dancing. So it was awkward. There were no tables to set your drinks on. But all that aside - I would have been ok with the place except for this - the worst part - the crowd. 35+ bridge and tunnel, may have money. No. Class. Very sleazy looking men and women who think they're attractive but are not. At all.  Just such awful clientele."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends after a night in Market Squae..   Please note they enfoce a dress code (simple dress code) - no tennis shoes and prefer a shirt with a collar.  We order our drinks. Pimm's Cup for the guys and a variety of Champagne assortment for the ladies.   (This is a full service bar with all the spirits).  The owner introduced himself after we first walked in.       The atmosphere - The bar is lined with sitting areas made up of modern furniture that you would see in your VIP secations in many clubs to promote conversation.    If you are not with a group of friends then this could be awkward.  We met a variety of people and had a great time.     Atmosphere - Dress Code (beware), VIP Section Style bar, Up tempo music, a good vibe Price - On the high end.    The drinks may run you $6-10 depending on what your order  (You can go crazy) -  Drinks - Very good pours - I really enjoyed my drink.  This is a fun place to end your Friday or Saturday Night."}
{"text":"From the bad DJ to the weird vibe/atmosphere. I don't think Perlé will ever be the bar for me. I don't know whether its the location, the people (Father Time over there dancing with girls young enough to be his great granddaughters...aka...CREEPY ), I don't know. But this bar is tacky plus playing Love and Marriage by Frank Sinatra as a GTFO of the bar song is bad. Sorry I'll take a dirty dive any day.    If this is Downtown Pittsburgh version of keepin' it classy. Pfft! I'll pass."}
{"text":"Was here for a reception.  The food was pretty good and the servers friendly.  If they served things that are on the regular menu, I would recommend the salmon and the pot roast bruchetta's, both were very tasty.  Upstairs the decor is a little tacky, they could use some better lighting than flickering recessed cans around the permiter of the room."}
{"text":"Walking through Market Square, we decided to try this little champagne bar.  The bartenders and wait staff were very accomodating, letting us try a champagne that met our likes (dry!).  Found a great one, and grabbed the table on the balcony overlooking the square.    Really nicely done tapas (\"Salmon Three Ways\" and \"Fromage platter\") were not only delicious, but generous, and very affordable for the amount of food (around 9 or 10 bucks but large servings).   The service was attentive but not nagging.  Very great vibe as we spent a super romantic evening noshing and sipping on a beautiful night in Pittsburgh!!  Would absolutely return and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Went at 6pm on a Thursday so didn't expect the place to be dead. Walked in and there were 4 others... an hour later, we were the only two at the bar. Fine with us, but strange being there alone.  Bartender was wearing shorts so strange dynamic ordering  $20+ glasses of fine champagne without the staff and ambience to match. Since it was empty the staff also restocked water while we were there so they were sliding packs of water down the bar. Not the best environment to hang out it.  Despite the odd vibe, the champs was delicious. Good selection of champagne, wine, beer and champagne cocktails. We stuck with the pure bubbly.  Bartender said the place picked up around 10 so maybe we were there too early. Would like to try this again but maybe later on a weekend. It has potential, just didn't quite meet our expectations."}
{"text":"I kept going between 2-3 stars but in all honesty, \"I've experience better\".  I'm not a huge champagne fan so this may contribute to the low rating in addition to other factors.  I opted for cocktails that mixed champagne with other types of alcohol so that I wouldn't be totally biased with my distaste for champagne.    I had the Champs- Elysees which is champagne with strawberry puree...there was a glob of strawberry puree settling on the bottom and top of the glass which made it challenging to drink the actual liquid in the middle.  Whoever made it was heavy handed with the strawberries and might have forgotten to hit the \"puree\" setting on the blender but rather hit \"chop in to indigestable globs\".    I also got the Le Petit Fizz (blue curacao, vodka, champagne) - weird - YES, weird in a good way - NO.  I enjoyed the blue color of the drink but there was way too much vodka and that's all you could taste.    I actually like the decor of the place, but agree with the others in that Perle seems like they are trying to be more clubby than classy.  The music was so loud that you couldn't hear other people talk.  I asked the waiter (who was really nice) if they could turn it down and they did, but it was still loud in my opinion for a place that doesn't even have a dance floor.    I may be back, but you can bet it won't be my first choice!"}
{"text":"What can I say about my experience at Perle? The thing that springs to mind immediately is to offer props to the Speakeasy in the back. It is not part of Perle proper. You have to walk straight back, all the way through the main section and through a small corridor in the rear. The speakeasy has a great old-timey vibe complete with sartorially appropriate bartender. Totally chill and a great place to have drinks with friends.  Both bars offer a decent selection of beer (including one of my favorites, Red Stripe) The drinks were reasonably priced and the 2 champagne cocktails that I ordered were tasty. I enjoyed the idea of it being a champagne bar, but that did not make up for the dismal music selection offered by the DJ and the, shall we say, interesting group of people in the main bar.  We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't terribly crowded. There were a few people my age, but for the most part it was an *cough* aged crew. Not that there is anything wrong with having a little experience, that's just not the scene I'm looking for.  I saved the bestest for lastest. There was this awesome elderly fellow who introduced himself as the host when he checked in on my group. When I tell you this guy was signing everybody's dance card, I mean it. He had some crazy swing dance moves, and I can only hope that I am that spry when I reach his level of life accomplishment.  Overall for no cover and tasty drinks, my experience was meh. If the speakeasy was a standalone joint, I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good Downtown Pittsburgh spot, awesome place to go to after a Downtown dinner.  I've been here a handful of times and have always had a good time.  The drinks always seem to be pretty strong.  Good service and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5 star - rounding up in hopes that they work out a few kinks. I tried to call, e-mail, and Facebook for a reservation for about a week prior. I did not receive a response to my e-mail sent via their website. There is no voicemail set up on their phone line. Finally, someone responded to my post on their Facebook wall that they only take table reservations for bottle service of $150 or greater.   For those reviewers talking about 'techno' or 'club' - its more like a lounge. I've been to a lot of clubs, lounges, speakeasys, house parties, raves, hoedowns etc. and I was pleasantly surprised by the DJ. I understand the music changes nightly so it could be luck of the draw - but yes, it was house music, but subtle and perfect for the atmosphere.   Annnyyywaayy - since it was a Thursday at 7:30, we had no problem getting a table. We had a couple bottles of bubbly. Each bottle came with some very tasty chocolate tuxedo strawberries. There was not much attention to service unfortunately - we refilled our own glasses and the bottles/ice buckets were left for a while until they needed cleared for our tapas, and we didn't have napkins or plates for the strawberries until our tapas came out.   The fromage plate was good albeit a little messy on presentation. I loved the salmon three ways although the pate and poke/ceviche could've used a dash of salt. We also tried one of the savory buckwheat crepes which was huge (plenty for seven girls to share at least a healthy bite).   Food stars of the night go to the dessert crepes.  We had a couple with Nutella, an apple tatin (my personal favorite, with almonds and ice cream) and a fruit-compote/coulis with whipped cream.   BIGGEST Debbie Downer of the night - tap system wasn't working!! They have a proprietary tap that pours champagne like beer. Our server told us they were cleaning the lines so it was 'broken' for the night (it's not broken). Whomp, whomp. We were looking forward to checking out the pour after our bottles. I will go back to see that.   Prices were really reasonable. $35 for the lowest price bottle of champagne, $7/glass, $8-10 cocktails.   FYI - Market Square does a \"$5 after 5\" valet right in front of the gyro place (its a square, so if you drive around once and don't see it ... drive around again). The valet guys are fast; just remember to get your ticket validated or it'll cost ya another $2. And tip your valet! They sprint to 3rd Ave to get your car!"}
{"text":"What a bummer! I was expecting so much more from Perle, especially after reading some awesome reviews. Alas, I left unimpressed, hungry, and not interested in returning - anytime soon, that is. My date and I arrived around 7p on a recent weeknight. There were a handful of small parties in the lounge, but it was not busy by any means. Date and I had visited their Web site earlier in the day and signed up for text message alerts. We received a message stating that we were able to get a free beverage if we showed the bartender our text.  Well, what do you know...the bartender and then the manager on duty were both unaware of the text. Odd, right? I mean it's in huge letters on the front page of the Web site. Luckily (and thankfully), we were able to still get a free drink. We stuck with the champagne beverages during our time there; each sipping 3-4 each (I lost count). We also ordered several items from their tapas menu, none of which I enjoyed enough to even spend more than a minute writing about. We didn't say anything to the bartender about the taste, but she did note that the chef was new (when apologizing for the insanely long wait in between each plate). Honestly, the food was mediocre and had I known it was going to be so blah I would have stuck with their tasty beverages (which they seem to have no issue making).  My final verdict? Give it a go, but have dinner beforehand or after at another restaurant in the area. We ended up at Vallozi's on Fifth Ave for more food afterward."}
{"text":"I have been to Perle a few time and this is exactly what Pittsburgh had been missing. It's beautiful inside, the drinks are great and there is a good crowd. I like the fact that they enforce a dress code and keep the place upscale. They have a big variety of champagne to keep the ladies happy. I can't  wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a nice space, with a dance floor a little balcony, and a 'speak easy' in the back. Like most other downtown bars however, the people here are ... old. The DJ set the mood with some classic Eurotrash hits but the girls on the dance floor made me question why I came out at all. I do like the idea of a champagne bar, and fortunately pouring a glass of champagne is hard to mess up. Their website says they have a happy hour on Fri 10-12, though I don't know what it is."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that a \"champagne lounge\" would be the newest addition to Market Square's continuing revitalization. Champagne on tap?! Who knew! Unfortunately, Perle falls flat on its face in almost every regard. The decor is, well, trashy. It's all black upholstered couches and recessed, multi-colored LED lights a la frat boy with an interior design budget. I was unaware that the prevailing aesthetic of the CENTER of downtown Pittsburgh is trending towards Bridge and Tunnel coke den. Come on Perle, we're better than that. Perle also seems to think that it's possible to cram a \"nightclub\", \"restaurant\", and \"lounge\" into the same, relatively small space. It doesn't work. They should have stopped with the menu and fancy drinks and not continued to the obnoxiously loud music emanating, I kid you not, from a kid with a MacBook and an accompanying saxophonist \"playing' what can only be described as 1991-inspired acid jazz. Gross. Finally, there was an entourage of what looked to be the owner/manager the night I visited making it feel like the place is an extension of someone's living room and not in a good way, in a clubby way. Of course I realize that my opinion may be in the minority as there are likely throngs of Cranberrians and Wexfordites who will be thrilled at the prospect of a \"real night out\" in tahn. Knock yourselves out, I'll happily be steering well clear."}
{"text":"I was here Thursday evening for a private event / industry holiday mixer, and I thought the place was very nice.  The door is at ground level in Market Square, and when you go in, you walk up the steps to the club level (from what I understand, there are no alternatives to the stairway for disabled or handicapped patrons).  They have a coat-check if you so desire, but I just found a table and placed my coat over the seat.  When I arrived at the bar, I asked to see the draught list, but they have no beers on tap, just champagnes.  They do have a small selection on beers sold by the bottle.  I chose a German Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse off the beer list, which was $6.75 (+ $2 tip = $8.75), which I thought was a little pricey, considering I can buy a whole six pack of this beer for $9.99 at Shop N Save, but I digress.  I saw that they had a food menu, but I didn't order anything.  The club itself is very nicely decorated, music was good, and not overpoweringly loud, and I loved how the windows at the front of the building overlook Market Square.  The bathrooms were modern and clean, and were nicely decorated with a very cool and colorful tile design.  I had a nice time mixing with some of my industry professionals, said goodbye, and then I walked over to the Original Oyster House for a little (inexpensive, deep-fried) snack, and then went home.  Would certainly come back again to Perlé if the occasion arose.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Pittsburgh for my sisters engagement party. This place was just opening when I moved from Pittsburgh to Tampa. My sister reserved an area for all of us and it was a nice set up. Nice lounge feel and the food we had was unique and flavorful. I really liked every thing that I tasted. I heard for their happy hour they offer the food similar to what we ate for $1 each. So you could order a whole tray for $20. When I glanced at the drinks they were very reasonable. I don't drink alcohol but everyone seemed to think they were reasonably priced. Not very strong though. They waitress was able to give me coffee. The only thing was the music was playing low and like 80s music at one point. It was weird. Kind of a boring crowd but nice for a pre game spot or the starting point for a celebration. The balcony they have looked over market square and it is a nice scenery for pictures. I also saw the have a back speak easy room with a flat screen tv. I am not sure if everyone is allowed to go back there. We ended up staying there until 11 and hitting up another spot. I am pleasantly surprised at how much downtown Pittsburgh has improved."}
{"text":"Perle is my fav. It sticks out here in Pittsburgh for two reasons. I absolutely love the service here. The staff are friendly and quick to recommend food to eat and help you navigate their champagne cocktail menu. My favorite is their sparkling sangria that is in the top five when it comes to the best sangria. I've tried lots of sangria but the sparkling aspect is freaking genius. I also love the music and the decor.  As soon as you walk up the stairs of Perle it's almost unexpected for it to be so nice. The balcony view is also a great view of the square Perle sits in. I always have a great time when I check this place out. Their drinks are a little on the pricey side but it's worth every penny. Their food comes from their sister restaurant Nola and Nola is great food."}
{"text":"I'm rounding up like another reviewer, in hopes that they might refine a few things. Stopped by with two co-workers for drinks and apps. Nice menu, and different cocktails. I like champagne and it's not often offered in bars, unless it is a $4 glass of J Roget or similar.  The space is large but furnished oddly - like a lounge/club - perhaps there is dancing on the weekends and the furniture is moved to the sides? I'm not sure. We were there after work, around 6 PM, so it didn't quite feel right.  The bar area is nice, if a tad over done. All the lights are gently pulsing LED's - a little would go along way. The bar light, the logo, the chandeliers - all slowly pulsing up and down. It's a little much.  Appetizers were quite good and the bartender was very knowledgable about the preparation. The seviche (brought over from a sister restaurant) were great; savory crepe was larger than anticipated, and while not easy to share very good. They did not have an eggplant ratatouille ready yet (something about 3 hrs to prepare - come on guys, plan ahead) but offered a substitute that we were pleased with. Chef cam out to chat and was a very personable young man, enthusiastic and funny.  I'll go back, but I would suggest they add maybe a banquette along the long wall with tables and chairs to accommodate dining - I think the food of high quality and they could really capitalize on it if the kitchen is large enough.  I didn't know about the dress code, but we came from work and passed the requirements."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived at about 9 on a Saturday and the place was pretty dead with terrible electronic music playing. It wasn't an awesome intro to the place. But we were able to get a couch since it was so dead and that was nice.   The menu has many options for champagne cocktails. I've been to Paris several times and when I saw they had Kir Royale I automatically ordered it. Then it arrived and I nearly spit it out. It had Hennessy in it - not a classic ingredient to a real Kir Royale. In a total accident -non coincidental to not liking my drink - my drink spilled and our waiter quickly cleaned everything up and and did give me a new drink. It was the Champs Elysees had strawberry syrup with champagne. Much better.   Overall the decor was cute with lots of circles and made me think of champagne bubbles. There was an open door and balcony out to Market Square. That would be nice in the spring or summer. But all in all the place was just \"meh\". I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decor is fresh an fun, plenty of space an seating. I was part of a private party on a Saturday evening, everyone was friendly a attentive. Would have been a 5 star experience but the food wasn't that awesome. Ordered the California ... It was 3/4ths bread, 3 shrimp an a dash of avocado. The ingredients make for a tasty mix but the huge shell the wrap this way to huge for the tiny portion of ingredient Overall great place, I'll just be sure to grab a bite to eat before."}
{"text":"Okay, I didn't go here during prime time (it was before 8:00 pm) but the club looks great and the bartenders are awesome.  We had a couple of delicious specialty drinks and enjoyed talking to the staff.     The fact that they have champagne on tap is pretty cool.    The best part is that the delicious cocktails don't break the bank, but maybe I'm just used to NY prices.  In any event, if I wanted to go someplace a little fancy for a night on the town in Pittsburgh, I'd go here."}
{"text":"Definitely a better experience the second time around.  Went here for a cocktail meetup, and knew right away that something was different.   The room was still sparsely furnished, but the music was better and at a volume that made it feel like a nice bar, but not a techno dance club as I had felt the first time that I was there.   This time I tried the Francois Rose which is served from their keg type system.  It was a well rounded glass of bubbly.  It was light and refreshing with a hint of sweetness at the end, but was definitely not a sweet Champagne.   The bar also put out some snacks for our group to try as we drank, a very nice crudite platter with delicious fresh veggies and what tasted like a yogurt dip and salmon crostini , which I did not partake in.    Overall for the price and the quality of the Champagne I will be back.  They seem to have finally found their niche."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on this one. I want to like it. I think like it. Sometimes I do. I'm not sure. I'm very bipolar about it, as you can see.   It's something I'd theoretically love! I love champagne and I love a good chill lounge. But what I love is turned into something I don't like here. Delicious champagne is mixed in with some not so delicious ingredients. I will say, I love mimosa's and bellini's. So going in I was excited to order some really exciting looking champagne cocktails. But, they were not good. They were actually really bad. So I switched the next time I went in to a Bellini. Again, not good. What's wrong? I don't get it!  So the next time I went in (yes, I've been there multiple times) I just stuck with champagne. I went with a friend's suggestion and it was awesome. The ambiance lacked a little. It wants to be a club sometimes with thumping house music. It wants to be a lax happy hour other times.   But then something magical happened. I got buzzed. It was a Friday night, the place was packed and the music was thumping. I had some delicious Spiropolous and I just couldn't resist getting more. It was incredible! So maybe this place isn't so bad. If you find the right drink, go with the right people and throw caution to the wind. That's my advice to you, use it wisely!"}
{"text":"The best part of Perle is not Perle.  I really like the bar in the back of Perle, called Speakeasy (you walk all the way through Perle to access Speakeasy).  Chill vibe, fun old-fashioned drinks, and great service.  Overall, the drinks at Speakeasy and Perle are tasty and reasonably priced.  They also both carry a good selection of craft beers.  Perle itself, though - eh.  It's the only champagne bar in Pittsburgh, so gotta give them that.  And the price point is great.  But the clientele is mostly cougar-central, and not being quite of cougar age yet, not sure if this is really my scene.  There is an older white-haired gentleman that patrols both bars, introducing himself as your host for the evening.  I don't know if this guy actually works there, but he is super-cool and I aim to be just like him when I hit my 80s.  He's got some killer dance moves, too!  He alone is worth a star.  And the DJ?  Awful.  I felt like he was actively trying to get people to leave.  That seriously can be the only explanation for his terrible music choices."}
{"text":"We went here last night after the super awesome Yelp event to have a cocktail.  We were greeted by Shawn, a very hospitable bartender.  He was great!  My friend and I were literally the only people there!  The ambience was like a nightclub with neon lights and modern furniture strategically placed to leave enough for a dance floor. It was a little too bright for my liking.  We didn't try any of their food or their champagne cocktails. I was in the mood for beer.  I had a Southern Tier Pumking with a side of Fireball.  Yum!  Perfect ending to my evening!  Would definitely go back to visit Shawn and try some of their menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I'm always waited on by the same server Tyler, who's awesome & gets our orders quickly. This place is closed at present which sucks but are set to reopen soon. I love a relaxed champagne lounge but what I hate is a loud club scene which this place has an issue with bouncing between & I would like it more if it was a chill lounge.... just my personal opinion. The prices aren't too bad,  the food is tapas & very good.  Their happy hour was well worth it ... especially on the food.  Looking forward to this place reopening soon."}
{"text":"Good music, stuck up customers, mediocre drinks, unfriendly bartenders. Left after one drink."}
