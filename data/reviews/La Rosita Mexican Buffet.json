{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Mexican places in Madison right now. I stopped in on a Saturday in the afternoon and found everything subpar. They ask you to pay before sitting down, that should have been my red flag. The buffet was sorta clean, the food was cold and not very tasty, and the deserts were store bought. The only redeeming quality was the somewhat friendly and attentive waitstaff. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Food was Very good! Different verity off food.The people where very nice. Sevice was good. I'll be going back to eat there. Price was perfect!"}
{"text":"We decided to try La Rosita Mexican Buffet for lunch last week. Located in a Strip Mall right off Monona Drive, parking was a little hard to find. The cashier station is immediately inside the door where you arrive and you pay BEFORE you eat. It was $10 per person for lunch and I was mildly confused at first since after I told her there were two of us I was expecting to be seated rather than billed. After paying she asked what we wanted to drink. Not knowing what my options were, I asked and she rattled off several beverages I didn't understand before I heard horchata and went with that. She also asked if we wanted corn or flour tortillas and we chose a mix. She told us to seat ourselves which we did and then we headed up to the buffet.

I've been to a Mexican buffet before. It included burritos, hard-shell and soft-shell taco fixings, fajitas, rice and beans. This was NOT like that.

First they do have a salad bar with what appears to be a variety of fresh vegetables. It was on par with what you find at a typical steak-house. It didn't actually try any of that though. They also had a fresh fruit bar w/about four varieties of sliced fruit. Again I didn't try that either. I was there for the Mexican food.

They had a couple of soups. I tried the shrimp soup. It was not my favorite. Although loaded w/lots of shrimp, they were shell on, and although it had lots of veggies it didn't have much flavor. They had chips as well as green and red salsa and pico. These were all tasty. They had rice and beans, a pan of quesadillas and enchiladas, several cold salads, some vegetable and some pasta dishes. These were fine, but not outstanding. What I really liked about La Rosita was the wide variety of entree dishes available. Chorizo, beef, riblets, chicken, multiple pork and pork skin dishes. They were basically sauces with meat. At an Indian restaurant you would picture all of these on rice. I enjoyed the myriad of flavors and textures and this was a huge selling point for me. 

However, one serious issue was that many of the entrees were not hot, but merely luke-warm at best. This was enough to cause my dining companion to say he would never return. He was very turned off by \"the cold food\".

When we returned to our table the cashier brought us a half dozen tortillas and large tumblers of delicious horchata. For dessert they had flan and cakes available, but none of those appealed to me.

I'm giving it a good review because I loved the large horchata, the variety of foods I've never had, and the flavors of the ones I enjoyed. This was a completely unique experience and I've never been to another buffet like this. I will go back and try it again. However, I can only hope they correct the temperature of the food. It was a major flaw."}
{"text":"I wish I had read some of the reviews below before going to this place. I will not be returning to this place...ever. The available food was cold and bland.  Actually, I am not sure if the steam tables were even on which screamed food borne illness."}
{"text":"We were told they were open so stopped in for a Friday lunch at approximately 1 PM. We were greeted promptly and directed to a table while the waitress went to get warm tortillas. Both corn and flour were offered. Thanks!

This is not a typical Tex-Mex buffet. No chimichangas, burritos, hard taco shells, or ground beef to be seen. Works for me! Rather, chorizo, steak fajita, stewed beef riblets, and homemade refried beans were there. Also they had something called \"green spaghetti\" and a \"red spaghetti.\" I only tried the green which was indeed green and looked like spaghetti in a green Alfredo sauce.  

Other entrée items included a pan of enchiladas. It was almost empty, a little crusty and tepid. They were just ok.  

They had a variety of hot stewed vegetable dishes and cold salads.  They also have a small salad bar and all of the vegetables appeared very fresh. 

They have a green and red salsa as well. This is the same salsa sold in their adjacent grocery store and are very good.

Desserts included yellow cake with a white frosting and a flan. The cake was dry and the frosting, ordinary. The flan was rigid.

Service was fine although the waitress did not come by to refill drinks which are included for the $12.95 price. 

I am an adventurous eater and was glad that the menu is not primarily Tex-Mex.  Disappointjngly, the entrée items I had (chorizo, steak, enchiladas and ribs) were on the marginal side and unappetizing looking.  The refried beans were fresh and good. 

Given the food quality, I think $12.95 is a little high. But I think we may have caught them on an off day and it may be better when their staff has a little more experience or at night or on a weekend when it is busier and the food is more quickly rotated and filled. 

I think we will give them a few more months before returning. Hopefully the kinks will be worked out and they will have a website or Facebook link with a menu

But big picture, we are very glad to see a Mexican buffet with more authentic type items.  Madison needed such a place and I think this is the City's first. So we look forward to visiting again and supporting them. 

Worth a try if you are in the area and want something a little different."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Food was fantastic, great flavors and hot. Waitresses were constantly turning it over and bringing it out fresh, even at  an odd time for lunch, 2pm. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not so bad. Not the best. Nothing special. Good price. Friendly people. Cold french fries - the kids couldn't eat that. Good variety of fruits. Good desert. Love the orchata."}
{"text":"This has a family ran feel.  The food is super authentic, which means if you think Taco Bell is authentic, this may not be for you.  Please enjoy with an open mind, it is hand made and terrific.  The buffet is very affordable with lots of options to choose from."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant walking into a Mexican buffet as this concept could have been a recipe for disaster, but that was not the case.  They did a good job!

Looking at the buffet offerings it did seem edto glean the standard buffet \"slime\" but upon sampling a few of the items we were pleasantly surprised.  The shredded pork had an amazing flavor, not the dry pork I was expecting.  They had a variety of what you would think of as fillings for fajitas and burritos but no tortillas on the buffet.  Those must be requested from one of the servers which is fine, but they ended up showing up when we were nearly at the end of our meal.  Also notable is the fact they had guacamole on the buffet although it was empty when we were up there.  Also available were desserts, chips and a small salad bar.

Beverage was also included with the buffet price and besides soda they had non-carbonated flavored beverages such as mango and pineapple.  A nice alternative to soda.  We also asked for just a half glass of horchata, a traditional Mexican beverage, which was good, but quite sweet.

You pay when you enter the restaurant and they are currently offering the buffet at just $10.  I got no indication of what the regular price will be.

Overall, they provide quality food for being a buffet.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"A lot of choices on the buffet for a great price. The staff kept up well with keeping the buffet stocked. Nice place for just yourself or a larger group. There was a large variety of meat options all flavored well."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounded up to 3. 
$13 all you can eat Chicken and pork-centric buffet!
Cheese enchiladas just ok. No other kind, which I expected and maybe some tamales too. Most offerings reminded me of an Indian buffet; rice topped with various meat stews. Flavors generally good but textures not so much.
Most dishes reminded me of a crock pot creation, and those that did not were quite the opposite-- dry and or oily. 
The veggie options were very disappointing. No shredded lettuce, onions were bitter, there was no avocado nor guacamole... :/
I was looking forward to the dessert options but all did disappoint. Service was friendly though."}
{"text":"Clean. 

Reasonably priced. 

We arrived right at the start of the dinner hour. There were people already there eating, but low inventory on the buffet. Meat was well seasoned, rice and beans were good, tortillas delivered to your table. 

Tamales were good. 

No avocado, guac, or queso."}
