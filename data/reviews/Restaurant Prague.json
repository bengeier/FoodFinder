{"text":"This place is much better than you might expect.  The food is really really good.  Homemade, good service, good beer.
Yes the dishes have an old fashioned presentation, but the flavor is there.  And yes the decor is a bit old fashioned, but clean.  But the food is really good.
So if you're one who does not judge the book by the cover, you'll like this place.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food.  We come to this small restaurant with our Montreal Czech friends.  Love the jäger with the mushroom sauce and the dumplings.  Not too pricy and good atmosphere.  I usually start with the pate.  Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Had lunch on Tuesday, when its difficult to find open resto in this area.

Im too new to tell whats Czech cuisine, but this place is definitely satisfying as a restauant. heartful service, delicious cuisine, pretty interior with hidden private atmosphere. we can also feel their love and pride of their own culture, and i love this kind of family owned restaurant very much.

this place is full of beautiful goods from Prague, like photos, ornaments etc...its absolutely worth to visit and ask them about one of the most beautiful city in the world."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!   The tap beer was cold and delicious.   The liver pate was smooth and tasty.  The roasted pig knuckles and duck leg was scrumptious.   If you haven't been...go!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago with friends who frequent the place and we loved it.

The server was quite friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu . 

I ordered the roasted duck leg which was served with a braised cabbage and dumplings, the duck leg was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, the dumplings were fluffy and the cabbage delicious. My daughter had the beef stroganoff which she said was really good and my husband had a steak which was perfectly cooked. One of our dining companions had the pigs knuckles and sauerkraut and the other two had sauerbraten (If remember correctly) which was also served with dumplings. We all did a very good job of polishing off our plates the only thing left on mine was bone from the duck leg. 

Good beers and we had a shot of Silvovice at the end of the night that really hit you where you live. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint....still the good service, excellent food and quiet ambiance...I love it"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems of CDN,
Went there after seeing it a year ago but never really got the motivation to go until I saw the ratings here in Yelp and boy we were not disappointed! It is a small restaurant, family owned and operated, cozy and with a house like feel to it. We tried the pâté de foie as a starter it was really good, probably the best I have tried so far in Montreal. Main courses were the Goulash for my wife and the Pig's knuckle with sauerkraut and dumplings for me, everything was delicious! I definitely recommend this place if you're nearby and with an appetite (portions are good to big)."}
{"text":"Brought my mother here, as I knew she'd enjoy St. Joseph's Cathedral. We sat on the steps and it was a beautiful experience for both of us to see the views. 

Then, to make things even better, we happened upon Prague Restaurant. We were feeling adventurous; I mean, Czech food?! But it's a good thing we did.

She had trout, and I had sole. It was not light, but both were so yummy! Even the house white wine was well-chosen. And the waitress was actually Czech, which was cool. In the U.S. the waitstaff is never the nationality of the restaurant. She was really nice. At the end, I ordered a liquor called \"slivovice\", which is NOT for the faint of heart. My mother has a taste for these things, so she liked it...but it really is strong! 

It's nice inside, and cozy. The food is tasty and portions are perfect. Are you hungry?"}
{"text":"My Czech cousin loved this authentic Czech restaurant.  It is family owned with mom doing the cooking and the daughter serving.  They are fluent in Czech, French and English and probably a few other languages.  The beef and snitzel  dishes were delicious.  The tilapia was ordinary.  The atmosphere is homey and friendly."}
