{"text":"My sister and I love this place! Awesome pizza. 

We always get sun-dried tomatoes and italian sausage, and it has been delicious every time.

The staff and delivery people have always been friendly with us and the portions are well worth the money. 

We'll continue to be loyal customers for our horror movie & pizza nights!"}
{"text":"I don't know how people like this place.  Worst pizza ever, and how can you mess up pizza?  Frozen pizza from food basics is better than this stuff.  I think I may have had 4 pieces of bacon, 5 pieces of pineapple, 2 strips of roasted pepper and a few flakes of chili peppers.  I paid 20 bucks for this?  Never again.

The pizza was bland and burnt, the service was unprofessional, and it was covered in grease.  I think the positive reviews were written by people close to the business, or ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Oakwood Pizzeria looks like an authentic Italian pizza joint, but once inside, the dreary decor and intimidating service from the owner destroys any good will a customer might have. The place is uninviting, and worst of all, the pizza is awful! 

Ingredients are frozen or canned. The 5 topping pizza special only comes with their pre-determined 5 toppings. It was a dull pie. Yet it was very expensive. The garlic bread was bland and oily. 

My boyfriend and I aren't overly picky foodies, but Oakwood was an utter rip-off. Trust us, save your money and spend half of it at Pizza Pizza for a better made pie! Never again."}
{"text":"Good party size pizzas for delivery. This is the go to place when the kids want 'za"}
{"text":"Highly processed pepperoni and canned mushrooms but on a near-perfect thin crust (light, chewy, crisp and thin yet strong enough to hold up under all 5 toppings of the inflexible **NO SUBSTITUTES** \"Everything\" pizza).  I'm a strong supporter of local small business but there's just no excuse for canned mushrooms in North America. The topping-to-surface ratio is a bit low and the sauce is forgettable but the portions are very generous and did I mention the crust?!  Overall a decent pizza but just doesnt stack up against the competition.  Rating: 2.5 pizza boxes."}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza in Toronto! family owned, authentic Italian pizza... Fast delivery! Must try. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I was a bit confused by the reviews being either very good or very bad so I decided to check out this pizzeria myself.  The restaurant itself has a nice lay out and the huge store front windows give it a very open yet relaxing feel.  After looking at the menu I understood some of the resevations of other reviewers. However, being a fan of family owned small business I admire the pursuit of specialization one product.  I ordered the everything, thin crust pizza with chilli peppers well done. The pizza and ingredients are well put together, and the crust is one of the finest I've ever had. The combination of olives and anchovies also pleasantly surprised me. On the downside the quality of the toppings seem to lack somewhat and the workers could have been more welcoming."}
{"text":"Above average pizza with a basic topping selection at a great price when you think about what everybody else charges for delivery. The order taker on the phone is a complete dick, though."}
{"text":"Wasn't even able to order because apparently sliced tomatoes cost more than pepperoni. They only offer 5 standard toppings of which 2 are meat, but to substitute out meat for cheaper vegetables costs you more. Super lame."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this pizza! 
Used to order from Pizza Pizza until we discovered this gem. Friendly staff, good service too."}
