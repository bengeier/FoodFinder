{"text":"Encore une très agréable soirée au petit bistro. La carte à été renouvellée pour notre plus grand plaisir. 
Cuisine toujours aussi gustative avec de plus en plus de surprises pour les papilles. Le poisson au café autant que la cassolette était tout simplement délicieux ! 
Comme à chaque fois Pascale a été parfaite, autant au niveau de sa bonne humeur que de ses précieux conseils."}
{"text":"Ambiance sympatique, service parfait ! Le menu est varié avec de très bon produits de base. Très abordable, menu des vins à tous les prix. Une très belle découverte !"}
{"text":"Très belle découverte.  J'avais lu beaucoup de commentaires positifs sur l'endroit et tous se sont avérés justes.  Service très cordial, sympathique et attentionné.  L'ensemble du menu était très alléchant.  J'ai finalement opté pour le tartare de bison qui n'était pas au menu.  Excellent.  L'assaisonnement est juste.  Mon invitée était ravie de la bavette.  Une belle finale avec un succulent gâteau au fromage.  Les prix sont corrects et avec Accès Resto, le tout devient plus agréable.  On le recommande?  Chaleureusement."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderfull service. Expect to spend at least 2 hours but it was time well spent."}
{"text":"After having failed to enjoy a nearby food festival, we stumbled on this very nice French bistro, with classy service, and excellent food.

Despite the proximity of the boulevard, the charming rooftop terrasse was surprisingly quiet in that late-August evening.

I had the Spanish octopus, and that was the best octopus I ever had in my life. I did not know octopus could be made so tender! It was served on a bed of crunchy bokchoi, edamame, grilled almonds, small kalamata olives, and chorizo. Absolutely divine! My husband had the grilled sea bass, with honey glazed carrots and mashed potatoes and that very well executed as well.

A special mention to one of the waiters, from southern France, for his attentiveness, politeness, and overall professionalism. One of his male colleagues, however, could benefit from a remedial course in the art of smiling. One could do without that particular part of the \"French experience.\"

If you are looking for the perfect Friday night date, in a genuine French atmosphere that will not break the bank, that's where."}
{"text":"Really good and tasty food! 
Fish soup waa die for! 
Lamb leg was tender and meat just fall of the bone. In Europe I ate differently cooked liver but never was impressed. Not this time! Veal liver was so-o tender and litle bit on rare side - cannot explain, you must try. 

Be prepared for little bit slow service... 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, super friendly staff. Food was superb and the ambience is great. Check out the terrace"}
{"text":"I couldn't leave Montreal without trying at least one french restaurant. My landlady recommended this place and we thought it was fantastic! It's such a shame for an awesome restaurant like this to have no reviews on Yelp. We opted for the rooftop seating since it was a cool night.  We started off with two glasses of Pinot Grigio and an Avocado Tartar, which was delicious. For entrees, we ordered a Lobster Risotto and the Lamb and we ended the night with a Profiteroles and Tarte Tatin. Presentation was fantastic for all the dishes and all the ingredients used were very fresh. My favorite has to be the lamb. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone immediately. The Lobster Risotto was a small portion but it was a little on the heavier side and was surprisingly filing. The profiteroles was amazing and the chocolate was very rich. Tarte Tatin (it's like an apple pie) was probably my least favorite (not because it was bad, but because it was not the taste I was expecting. I think they used a different kind of apple to make the filling). But nonetheless, the meal was fantastic and more people should know about it. 

FYI: All the menus in Montreal were in French, but our waiter was more than willing to translate literally the whole menu."}
{"text":"Comparativement à un autre restaurant français place Valois qui lui ressemble, l'expérience n'a pas été bonne. Par deux fois cet endroit m'a déçu. La première fois, un midi, plutôt bruyant au passage, où sur 3 convives, 2 avis mitigés, ça part mal. 
Nous souhaitons lui laisser une seconde chance, un soir de feux d'artifices où la carte propose le menu à \"seulement\" 33$ passé 22h (soit quand même 10$ de plus que l'autre adresse place Valois qui offre sa carte de soirée après 21h30). Nous commandons donc un plateau de fromages et une bouteille de vin pour accompagner. La serveuse nous conseille un vin qui ne s'accorde pas vraiment avec les fromages, et ceux-ci goûtent plus le chlore que le fromage. On en fait la remarque et demandons un autre choix car l'un des 4 n'est pas mangeable, la cuisinière fait transmettre à sa serveuse que c'est l'huile de truffes qui donne ce goût et refuse de nous le changer. Je ne tiens pas à m'obstiner, juste une totale déception, pour un restaurant français j'aurais préféré de bons fromages français plutôt que québécois d'une part, (Les spécialités québécoises sont disponibles et mieux choisies dans d'autres restaurants fameux à Montréal!) d'autre part les employés et/ou gérants de l'établissement sont très \"limites\"."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner here. For dinner you pay 39.5 and you can choose 3 courses from most of the menu. The fried calamari is so delicious. It is very tender and not overcooked. The service is awesome too."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! We had the most wonderful dinner for a great price. Neighborhood feel and the best French cuisine we ever had in Montreal. 
The Frog Legs Salad, Frois Gras and Escargot for appetizers. The main course of Bavette Steak, Duck Tartar, Rabbit medallions and risotto with lobster was amazing. The lobster was better than what we had in Boston just a few days before. Deserts? Cheesecake and Chocolate pie can't be missed. 
It's close to downtown but not in the tourist area. Take a special someone or a client. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, and I'm pretty sure I will stop by again for dinner. Le Petit Bistro looks spacious, warm and welcoming. 

Food is on the pricey side, but it's totally worth the experience. Lunch special comes with soup or salad. As for soup, they had Crème d'Endives today, and it was great to start your lunch. As for plat principal, I ordered Risotto with Shredded Duck Confit. This dish is a total must-try. My friend got Beef Tartare which was good as well. The portion was really big. There are other interesting dishes on the menu as well like Hanger Steak and Mahi Mahi."}
{"text":"A great experience delivered every time. I've had the chance to try it on several occasions and from a relaxed lunch outside on the terrasse to the comfy feeling of a winter diner and jazz music during winter, this place always delivers. 
Food is upscale without the price, great service without the stuffiness.
A definite recommendation if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Surprisingly upscale French restaurant for the very local, neighborhood-y vibe.

My friends and I came for dinner after 9pm on a Thursday. The upper floor terrace was totally packed, but we got a nice seat by the window on the bottom floor. We seemed to be one of the few people on the bottom floor given the nice weather, but the waiters were still great about being available and providing great dining service.

The food definitely seemed to be a good value for the price and quality of the food we got. The pork loin and duck confit were the winners at the table. I also really loved the foie gras mousse that came out as an amuse bouche.

This was a very traditional French meal and very memorable!"}
