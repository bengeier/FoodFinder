{"text":"The service here was incredibly bad and slow. Something when wrong in the system. And we ended up waiting for our food for 30 mins while we were first in line. The food did no taste good. The put the tomato sauce on top of the cheese. I don't recommend this restraunt."}
{"text":"Great food would definitely recommend the crab fries a to die for and the cheese is unbelievable. The people are super friendly it's  a must stop."}
{"text":"Checked this place out cause friends rave about it, unfortunatley it doesnt live up to the hype, they offer no combinations for any products served indiviual pricing for every item on the menu. Would have had better service from the dead in a cemetry, have signs posted rated #1 sports bar in north america by espn ... they must have gotten those guys drunk that did that rating.  Dont even have lids or straws for drinks that are ordered with the prices they charging they could afford it. Too top it not even a restroom in the joint makes you wonder how the employees wash their hands.  Honestly the worst $70.00 I ever spent next time  just take the kids to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Great idea to order with screens. This idea works with very few people in the place. But when 10 people show up the place falls apart. Bad service and ok-ish food"}
{"text":"Good food for amusement park but they can do better with their service....so darn slow"}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad. Workers aren't unfriendly just seem to have no training. you order and pay at one station, receive your drink at another station, and your food at another beyond that. however 1. no one tells you this and 2. there are no signs that indicate this, you kind of have to figure it out and ask other bewildered starving customers. 

Also it's just skinny crinkle cut fries with old bay seasoning. I wish people would stop using \"crab\" as an adjective when they really just mean they used old bay, it can be used for anything..."}
{"text":"Chickie's & Pete's is a sports bar / restaurant chain based in the Philly area that is rapidly expanding by popping up in amusement parks across the country.  This one opened in Carowinds earlier this year.  The restaurant sits in the back of the park across from the Goldrusher coaster.

While their regular restaurants most likely have table service, at this one you ordered at the counter, presented your ticket for drinks at the next window and picked up your food at the 2nd window.  

The restaurant is famous for their crab fries and philly cheesesteaks.  I only tried the former and a beer.  The fries are a crispy crinkle cut fry with old bay seasoning and a cup of a cheese sauce.  For $8 you get a huge cup of fries so it's almost like getting your money's worth at an amusement park (if that ever happens).  The fries were crisp and seasoned well and quite good (not as good as Boardwalk Fries though).  The cheese sauce was disappointing. And it was hard to find ketchup anywhere here.  

There are different options for beer including some craft beers from Victory (Downingtown, PA) and Big Boss from Raleigh.  The Victory beer was a Belgian ale specially made for Chickie's and Pete's called Crabbey Ale. It's not the best beer I've had from Victory but still better than the Budweiser crap and it was the same price as the other beers, $7.99.

There is plenty of seating inside in the A/C and a few tables outside.

Still I am glad to see Carowinds adding places like this as alternatives to regular amusement park food."}
{"text":"The theme park chain has pulled in this outside food source . The food was acceptable but the service was ridiculously slow. We ordered fries and a sprite . Total was $13.62. I gave the cashier $15.02 . He returned the two pennies unclear on what to do with the change. We watched the kitchen staff fumble to put together orders. One woman could answer where the ketchup was (a bottle on every table ). We waited for 15 minutes for one order of fries.....which say on a shelf just out of arms reach the whole time. Fries were decent but even on a slow day, prepare to wait. Reasonable beer selection, including Natty Greene's."}
