{"text":"I had order twice in the same day from this location! The first chicken caesar wrap I ordered was amazing, made exactly the way it should of been made! I went back later to get another chicken Caesar wrap for dinner, the girl put the wrong lettuce in, it has shaved carrots and red cabbage in it! Last time I checked chicken Caesar doesn't have those things in it! As soon as I had got home I went to eat it, I pick it up and everything completely fell out of it! The girl gave me a ripped wrap! It was my first time ever going there, and the second time I went in the same day, it was horrible! I've emailed the company the same day it happened and have not heard anything from them! Great way to serve your customers! Not!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, hardworking staff but overpriced, lacklustre food. Advertising themselves as a \"healthy-option\" they still chose to microwave my grilled chicken and douse my salad in way too much dressing. The strawberry-mango smoothie I order tasted like it was made with artificial flavours and anything but fresh ingredients. To top it off, everything is greatly over-priced. Save your money for somewhere else 'cause this place sucks."}
{"text":"I had their Miami bowl here a few weeks ago and I got food poisoning. I used to go there every other week, but I think they might have changed their personnel and not trained them properly for food storage (temperature). The alfalfa sprouts smelled funky.

I was a regular, but after getting so sick and throwing up in my son's daycare later that afternoon, sadly, I will never go again."}
{"text":"Du fast-food \"santé\"! :) Pour ma part, j'ai goutté au \"Cultures Healthy Club\", ainsi qu'aux salades, hum! Bien bien bon! Dans le centres commerciaux du centre-ville de Montréal, il y a des aires de restauration et on est bien content de trouver autre chose que des hamburgers et des frites. Cultures offre une gamme de repas rapides avec un peu plus de \"vert\" et de bonne variété."}
{"text":"Came here with a mommy friend for lunch.  Had the split pea soup and the vegetable panini as part of a combo (drink is also included in the combo).  

Food is decent but not memorable.  Not quite as good as Panera - which is one of my absolute (depending on location) favourite places for chain style soup/ sandwich/ salad cuisine.  Sandwich was not quite as flavourful as the subway subs either."}
{"text":"The broccoli quiche is delicious... cashier is nice. Got chicken noodle soup and it's not super flavourful but I'm guessing it's cause there's less sodium than your typical fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the zen bowl with chicken. Sauce isn't enough to mix everything together and also they microwave the meats to reheat. The bowl tasted more dry than tasty. Service is always good and consistent."}
{"text":"I am generally a positive writer but for this location I would definitely avoid going.  Not sure how a grilled cheese can fail, but it did!  It was dry, hard and tasted like I chose a leather shoe sandwich from the menu. So sorry!"}
{"text":"Usually, if I go to a food court I try to buy something \"healthy\" aka subways. And dufferin mall was close to work and I needed lunch. So off to the mall just thinking about a tuna on whole wheat sandwich! Much to my surprise, they were closed due to renovations. And I definitely did not want Manchu wok or kfc. The only other \"healthy\" option was cultures.

 I ended up ordering their Southwest bowl which consisted of corns, avocado, sweet potato, and grilled chicken on a bed of brown rice with some chipotle sauce. The word avocado got me - I loveee avocado! The lady there was super nice and helpful with my order. In the end, it costed me almost $10 for something you can so easily make at home. As for the food, I wish they loaded up more on the sweet potato and avocado though. It was still good but I don't think I'll want to spend that much on lunch that often!"}
{"text":"I like it better than Freshii,  It's no Salad Days (in downtown Toronto), but there is a lack of healthy (and reasonably priced) options in the Square One area.  

They have certain combos starting at 7.99 (3 salads and a drink) to 9.99.  I got the wrap, 2 salads and drink combo for $8.99 plus tax.  The wrap was good (grilled chicken and eggplant) and the salads were fresh.  

Overall, if you are at Square One and want something healthy, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been bland and tasteless. It's all bread or all unsauced pasta salad. 

Healthy food doesn't have to be this boring. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got a salad said bacon on menu they put on artificial bacon bits definitely skip this place"}
{"text":"I usually don't come to cultures, but it's a \"healthy\" option compare to other fast food places. I wasn't impressed with the quiche at the Scarborough Town Centre location (oily) but the wraps are decent! $6.77 after tax for wrap and bottle water special.

I got the #1 (bistro), which is a base of deli turkey slices and you can choose as many toppings as you want from the selection in the display! Choice of whole wheat or spinach wrap, and a variety of cheeses, veggies and sauces. I put the place a 4 star because the Bistro option is worth your money, having no limit to toppings and it's pretty tasty too

Their frozen yogurt is okay, tastes like a soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here. 
The worst. I asked for a tuna wrap. The lady said ok. She put tuna on a wrap with lettuce and put it in the panini press. I didn't even know what happened. She didn't ask me for toppings or sauces. I asked her to remove it and put spinach, avocado, tomato, cheese- and asked her what other toppings were there. She said there weren't any. LIES! I've always wen to the cultures in Dufferin mall and they are amazing! They assist you, and will show you toppings. There was NO cheese in it when I asked her to put it in. This is tasteless. I paid $8 for this??! NOT WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"Lorsque je travaillais au Centre Eaton et que j'oubliais mon lunch chez moi, j'étais extrêmement heureuse d'avoir accès à un Cultures dans l'aire de restauration. Disons que c'est un bon life saver parmi tous les fast foods du centre d'achat. De un, ils proposent de vraies options santés, les employés connaissent leurs recettes, pouvant donc vous énumérer les ingrédients de tout sur le menu sans problème, et il y a toujours une belle sélection de salades fraîches très variée; quinoa, trois haricots, la césar, pomme brocolis, etc. De deux, c'est frais. Je veux dire, Cultures c'est une grosse chaîne, on en retrouve dans presque tous les centres d'achats à Montréal, et overall je leur donnerais un gros 2 étoiles parce que c'est pas toujours au top niveau fraicheur. Mais ici au moins j'ai l'impression que c'est frais. Et de trois, les portions sont énormes. Oui ça coute une dizaine de dollars pour 2 salades et un panini, mais personnellement j'en ai assez pour mon diner, mon souper, et pour gratter un peu encore dans le fond du plat de styromousse pendant mes late night cravings. 10$ pour un 24h de nourriture, ça me va. Par contre, le café goûte l'eau. Prenez pas la peine d'y goûter vous allez juste vous bruler la langue avec de l'eau bouillante et ne pas pouvoir profiter des saveurs de votre salade grecque."}
{"text":"Bit overpriced. Ordered #3 veggie with tofu sandwich. Kale salad & pasta sides. Chocolate milk. $10"}
{"text":"I'm eating the turkey brie sandwich right now and omgggg so good! Dufferin mall has the generic \"mall food options\" but this one definitely stands out amongst the rest. Fresh food options including salads (which looked absolutely delicious), sandwiches and soup. Also, the meat didn't look like it was slimy - like another chain sandwich store may have. Also, great service! A little on the pricier side, but at least it's healthy!"}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like is that I have to go to Square One each time I want to order anything from Cultures. I always get the three salad option since it is healthy and the price is reasonable. Always fresh and quick service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This fast food joint is pretty incredible and is often overlooked as it is geared towards healthy living. What most most people forget are that fresh vegetables and sauce makes up for a freshly taste. This is what culture is, a healthy alternative to avoid the unhealthy servings from the big chains. If you need a change in your diet then Cultures is a way to go.

The menu consist of delicious sandwiches, wraps, salads and smoothies. The prices are affordable and in return is a satisfying meal. They also give you the option to customize your sandwiches and place the vegetables you like. Bonus!!

I myself was feeling a little boring and hence I tried the Baja Chicken Avacado. The ingredients were fresh, and suprisingly the avocado was a nice touch. It had a nice kick ad the spicy grilled chicken was cooked and seasoned to perfection.

If you are making a change in your diet. Restaurants like these are a way to go. I can vouch to you that this a place worth checking."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't all that impressed with this place. After all, I had a spinach chicken salad creation and I didn't feel good after consumption.  But once my sister came home one night to tell me, \"There's a place in Dufferin Mall and their chicken is so fresh, and so moist.\" I had to go back and give them a second try. I am ever glad I did! The wrap I had was AMAZING!!!! I got a spinach wrap with some brie cheese, chicken, chickpeas,  avocado, lettuce and olives and their Chipotle sauce and mmmm mmmm mmmm scrumptious! My bf order a similar wrap, on a whole wheat pita, chicken, spinach, cheese, avocado... Delicious!

Shortly after my second try of cultures I went back a third time and ordered a similar wrap..... So good. I definitely recommend going here the next time you're at Dufferin mall and would like a healthier option.. They grill these wraps to perfection!!!! 

Great, now I'm hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Downgrade!!!

I asked the lady to please use tongs when preparing my soba salad.  She said \"we use tongs\" and then proceeded to use her hands (covered with plastic gloves) to put the items in my salad.  The gloves touch surfaces throughout their kitchen.  USE TONGS!!!  I was livid!"}
{"text":"My first year working in Toronto, I used to frequent Culture's, as it is quite close to the elevators I take to work.  I recall in that first year, having severe gut rot from their terrible coffee, and the word \"Hamwich\" will live forever in the part of my brain that stores awkward product names.

However, this morning, after a 3 year hiatus....
Their smoothies and muffins are simply delightful!!  

Every sip of yogurt smoothie removed me from this world and replaced me, winged, upon a heavenly cloud, where I sat with Linda Kash, reminiscing the shock we both felt when Mork and Mindy were married.  

The muffin was pretty okay too."}
{"text":"Damn, what happened Cultures?? You guys had a GREAT Asian salad a few years ago. Huge bowl, lots of green leaves, plenty of ingredients, on-point dressing.... what I got was basically what we tend to get from franchises who cut corners just to increase profits.

- Bowl is about half as big now but the price is actually more expensive.
- Ingredient quality is simply not as good, not as fresh. 
- Amount of ingredients are less generous.
- What happened to the awesome dressing? Tasted fake.

Honestly, it's not every day I go for a health option but I'd be damned if I'd pay for an overpriced mediocre salad.

Sad."}
{"text":"First time getting something from Cultures.  Chose this over the other fast food places because it seemed healthier.  Ordered chicken and sun dried tomato panini.  $7.xx for a sandwich, you would expect something of a decent size.  The bread was so small, the size of a hotdog bun.  Filling wise, i got 4 thinly sliced pieces of chicken breast, but at least it was real chicken, not deli meat, a slice of eggplant, 2 pieces of pepper, and some pesto mayo type sauce.  NOT WORTH IT."}
{"text":"The worst meal i've had in such such such a long time!
No taste what so ever! I literally had it about 15 mins ago, and I currently have some weird stomach aches!
Two of us bought two of their super bowls.it's a tasteless pile of things that don't go together..
The shouthwest bowl and the Zen bowl!
Ughhh! Who mixes cilantro with Mango with quniua with rice with cherry tomatoes! OMG!
I tried one of their protein sub, that is a Quinua balls! The nastiest thing on planet earth!
Those two bowls cost me $23!
Horrible horrible experience! Stay away!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for food when shopping at the Dufferin Mall. The food is relatively healthy and high quality, and they have a good selection of sandwiches, wraps and bowls.

They currently have a grilled chicken plate special for $9 ( tax included) - with grilled chicken, a large serving of brown rice, and two side salads it's a fantastic value."}
{"text":"I got the Asian salad with some modifications. It was tasty but the mango they used was frozen chunks that had been thawed. Quite expensive for what your getting. The kicker is that I ate this and like 10 minutes later I was sick to my stomach and in cold sweats. Not impressed"}
