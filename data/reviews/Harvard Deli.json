{"text":"Stopped by this location when I was in town visiting family. Wow, that corned beef sandwich was awesome. I will likely return when I am back in town. Like the other reviews state, you can split the the meat and make two sandwiches. Be careful when you visit. The neighborhood appears a bit rough."}
{"text":"I love this Place  The corned beef are the bomb diggity lol  I come in from Michigan and don't leave without two of Them  
The neighborhood Is part of Cleveland"}
{"text":"We were visiting, in the process of moving to Cleveland, and just Googled \"corned beef.\"  The deli was on the way out of town, so we gave it a try.  It is your typical diamond in the rough.  The corned beef was juicy, tender, and plentiful.  As another reviewer noted, the neighborhood ambiance keeps it from being 5-stars.  It's kind of like the best Chinese restaurants in SF Chinatown.  The more stairs you need to climb, the better the food.  We had to stop along the way home to eat, because there was no way I was going to be able to drive and eat that monster at the same time.  It ended up being lunch and dinner.  As Arnold said, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"The food: delicious, one of the best reubens I've had.  I asked the guy if he could make a reuben considering it sounded like he had all the ingredients.  He explained that a reuben is technically grilled but would be happy to make it without grilling since he didn't have one.  It was the perfect size for lunch and not one of those ridiculous overstuffed sandwitches where you cant even eat it and is basically just a pile of meat (like Corky and Lenny's).

The neighborhood:  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars; you'll see."}
{"text":"I came here for a corned beef sandwich since Slyman's is closed on the weekends and it was pretty good all things considered. If you decide to get a corned beef sandwich from here make sure you order it lean and ask for extra slices of rye bread. The sandwich is so big that there is no way one person could eat the sandwich with all that meat on it at once. You will definitely want to break it up into two sandwiches. For $7.50 you can get a sandwich and a pickle and be good for the rest of the day. Say hello to the old fashion days where you get a huge quantity of quality food with less reliance on accessories for filling such as fries, salad, and other sides that don't mean nothing to your hunger pains. 

Also try their other sandwiches such as turkey, roast beef, ham, etc...and have them dressed with cheese, mustard, and a dill pickle! Harvard Deli is a convenience store which also offers, drinks (wine, liquor, juices), smokes, snacks, and pretty much anything you need. New Yorkers call them \"Bodegas\". Anyway, if you are ever in the HVD area of Cleveland, OH stop by and check em' out."}
{"text":"I love the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches.   They are the best.  Service is great, a very friendly place.  I can get everything that I need at once.  It's often crowded but things move quickly."}
