{"text":"Terrible and rude service. Empty place on a summer Friday night. No ambiance. Very poorly stocked bar despite their menu. There are much better pizza places and bars in the area - I would try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wednesday night and you're not here ? You're missing out big time. They have really good oven baked pizzas, only a few varieties to select from but all the choices look pretty solid. I had the champignons (mushroom) pizza which is not as simple as it sounds. It had few spicy tones (not super spicy like Indian food obviously, more like chilli flakes lightly dusted) and then a really smooth cheese and mushroom flavour with nutty accents. What do I even say about the flavours, superbly worked out, ingredients are such good complements to each other. The mushroom-nut combination really adds a layer of intricacy to the pizza. The ambience is absolutely hipster, almost looks like a cut out from an Instagram magazine (interior kind of like SuWu in St Laurent). They have a small dance floor and DJ in the back (I'm definitely bringing a date here). Music is amazing btw! The staff are super friendly and very helpful. They were a little late with our pizza but they gave us complimentary drinks to make up for it and that really made my day. I came on a Wednesday so pizza was half priced so my bill really came to just $8 total! I can totally see this place becoming a regular favourite for me soon."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place for sometime now.   The long and the short is that we were kinda disappointed.   I mean, One would figure to take care of your patrons a bit better, especially that there weren't many to attend to.   We asked the waitress to change the aggressive and loud music or at least turn it down. She refused, pretexting that it was part of the \"ambiance\"....heuuu, not exactly working the \"ambiance\" thing ...place is 3/4 empty. Abort the \"ambiance\" concept at play. Try another, this one seems to fall short.  1) mushroom pizza: the nuts on the pizza where stale...c'mon guys!! Not many mushrooms on it either...and still looking for the oyster mushrooms on the pizza. Suggest that if you don't have all the listed ingredients that you advise patrons that item is not available. Even bad pizza is still good pizza...so we ate it...cause we are professionals.  2) prosciutto pizza: much, much better.  The olio piccante, not piccante at all. I appreciate that good oil is very expensive...Clearly, this was not.  Last thing, please clean the puffy lightbulbs...they r full of dust at plain view...and directly on patrons tables. Not very comforting as to the cleanliness of the place...and no hot water to wash our hands ...why???"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had a good pizza outside of little Italy. Opened a little over a week ago. Have to say the atmosphere it's quite pleasant. Has this bar feel to it and they brought back some of the 80s look with the old stereo, cassette box and old school phone. The staff was amazing and service super friendly.  If ur a fan of thin pizza with a fantastic crust, this is a must!! I had the mushroom pizza and  wow! It's packed with all kinds of flavours. The first slice was all about trying to figure out the flavours. Sweet, salty, basil, types of mushrooms, and that crust! After that first slice I inhaled the rest.. The this pizza actually melts in your mouth.. Margherita pizza  was was my other choice and lived it too. Flavours were a little more subtle. The cheese just oozing and the basil makes all the difference. Oh and that crust !! I'm one to always leave the crust behind but not this time.  This place is a must go try.. And I'll keep wanting more. If u you're one not to eat the crust I dare you not to on this pizza!"}
{"text":"Happened to pass by and stop in for a drink as it looked like a cool spot. Loved the decor and the staff was incredibly friendly. The pizza looked amazing and will have to go back to try some. Enjoyed our drinks!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Watts, so much so that it's become a ritual for me on Wednesday nights after work.  The staff are really nice, attentive, and accommodating.  The pizzas taste great, and have a really unique flavour that sets this place apart.  I also appreciate the kitchen staying open until 11 PM, and sometimes even midnight.  Half price on Wednesday doesn't hurt either, just saying :P.  My favourite pizza is the \"Champignon\", French for \"Mushroom\", and for the first few times it was all I wanted.  I still like to have a wider sample range to truly evaluate, so one time I asked if I could have a half Champignon and half Margherita.  It was an interesting night - I ended up with half mushroom, and a whole tiny Margherita :D.  They were both great, but I definitely recommend the Champignon on it's own.  Pizza aside, Watts also serves dessert, usually a cardamon crème brûlée, unfortunately I really can't recommend that.  I've tried it a few times but always found it to be lackluster.  You'd be better off going down the street to Else's.  Now that's what I call a good cheesecake!  Back to Watts, there's a lot to recommend here, so come down and see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"L'ancien ''Salon Officiel'' est mort, vive le nouveau Watts!  Nouveau décor et nouvelle ambiance hipster, on y sert maintenant de la pizza, vins, cocktails et bière, donc maintenant plus de style restaurant que bar. Mais après tout, après avoir goûter à unes de leurs pizzas (pizza champignons 14$) + leur salade césar (10$), je dirais plutôt que c'est un bar qui sert de la bouffe que vice-versa. On a bien aimé, le relooking de l'endroit, mais côté bouffe, pas top au niveau goûts & qualité, si toutefois, je reviens, je vais m'abstenir de la nourriture et boire seulement. Menu simple, mais à améliorer. Conseil, c'est bien quand on sort en couple/amis et on boit et on a faim pour grignoter, mais ne venait pas ici pour simple but de manger uniquement. Y'avait juste 4 gars à une table et un autre groupe de 4 personnes qui sont arrivés, se sont assis, on vu le menu et sont repartis, bref...Prix abordables. Service ok de la serveuse. Y'a des TV pour voir les parties de hockey. Pas de wifi. Cartes de crédits acceptées.   3,5/5 visité en novembre 2015"}
