{"text":"Something has happened.  Delibee used to be a great place for the traditional Montreal smoked meat and fries but the last few times we've ordered take-out - the quality has been sub-par and the fries went beyond good old fashioned slightly greasy fries to some sort of grease soaked potato substance.  

We haven't given up on them but it will be a while before we order again.  Hopefully, this is a temporary glitch in quality."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. The smoked meat was juicy and delicious. Very comparable to Schwartz's and the main. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
I enjoy the Montreal standard that is Schwartz but I'm sorry Delibee's is a cut above, the smokiness, the tenderness, the taste. So good. Don't expect that watery generic mushy type smoked meat people think is real \"Montreal\" smoked meat like you get at casse croutes throughout the city, this is the real deal along with Schwartz. Their fries, hand cut red potatoes are top notch as well.
Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place through this app. Great cozy little deli in this cute little neighborhood. Very charming. Tried their smoked meat platter which had the best crispy fries ever. Mium Mium everything. Will definitely be back instead of going all the way to Ile Perrot."}
{"text":"A nice throwback: nostalgic decor, wooden benches, unpretentious space, even an old plastic Shriners donation box in the shape of a crippled kid.  Kitchen shared with the tavern next door, which slowed our service, forgivably under the circumstances (we came off-peak hours).

But the food is good.  We had the Mayfair special named for the adjacent tavern (all dressed hot dogs and your choice of potatoes; I chose latkes).  My youthful companion had a toasted Montreal bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon.  No capers, which disappointed, but still tasty. And the Shirley Temple was well done.

Unfortunately, they presented the bill without a pretax subtotal, and does not provide credit card stubs with a tip line; bring a calculator."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. Salty and dry... I took the medium smoke meat and it was very dry, so i wonder how the lean would me. The place has a nostalgic feel to it... But they really have to get their act together. Based on my last meal, i think you can get better smoke meat at any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"In Highschool I used to go here quite often for lunch.  They have good french fries and subs, also their smoke meat sandwich is pretty hype too.  I was able to afford going to this place when I was in Highschool so you know the prices are good.
  If you go for lunch during he week expect to see a lot of kids from the local Highschool."}
