{"text":"The food at a Passage to Indian is PHENOMENAL, it is my favorite Indian spot in Charlotte. Every dish is flavorful and fresh. Their buffet is first rate and very reasonably priced. At lunchtime, they are always packed to the gills. I definitely recommend eating there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and worth 5 stars. Delivery is very slow and took almost 2 hours to get our order."}
{"text":"I finally tried the buffet here a few weeks ago and wow. I hate buffets and I would never eat at one yet I decided to go for it since I love their regular menu so much. Plus, it was a way for me to sample a lot of Indian dishes that I haven't had a chance to try yet. It's the best buffet I've ever been to. It's $11 and completely worth it. 

This place is the best restaurant in the University area, and it's also now one of my top 3 fav restaurants in Charlotte. The staff are very polite and nice. Great customer service. And it's cheaper than other Indian restaurants in Charlotte. The decor is very pretty as well."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch buffet! I hope this new place takes off. Very good food for a good price. I only wish they had their buffett at dinner too. There was an excellent selection and everything we ate was fresh and hot. No complaints!"}
{"text":"For Indo-Chinese in Charlotte, this is place to go. We have ordered their Gobi Manchurian, Veg,Egg and Chihcken Fried Rice so many times, I am addicted now.
Their delievery service is quick and efficient and food is great. Would love to try other food variety sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We loved it! The food was so tasty! The chutney is delicious! Our service was very friendly and professional. There were quite a few customers that came in to eat or pick up their take out. We ate in for dinner, and plan to go back. It was a very pleasant experience and of course the food was all wonderful!"}
{"text":"1. An Indian joint usually serves lousy buffet... WRONG in case of this place. Every single time the food is amazing.
2. Servers are okay. Ambience is ok...Nothing extra ordinary about them. Which kinda compensates for the good food.
3. Try their Dum Biryani... It takes 45mins but is worth waiting every single of those mins.
4. All in all, it gets all 5 stars for the food. And it is not even that costly!
I would suggest first timers to try the buffet."}
{"text":"My husband and I was craving some tasty Indian food. We saw the ratings on Yelp and Google and decided to give it a try. As we entered the restaurant we were both greeted and was immediately seated. 

There was a few people at this time, which was around 530 pm. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and the seating was comfortable. Seating options include tables and booths. We sat on a booth.

The menu had a huge selection of appetizers, meat, and vegetarian dishes. I was also surprised to see a selection of asian food like egg rolls and fried rice. We were also given some sort of flat bread with dipping sauce. It has an interesting taste and my four year-old actually liked it.

We ended up ordering two lambs samosas, chicken tika masala, chana masala, plain nan, and egg fried rice. Our entr√©es came with basmate rice. The food was served in beautiful silver dishes and the amount off food given was excellent. Not only was the food tasty to look at but was also delicious and full of flavor..we tasted all the spices. 

Over all, I am giving this place a solid 5 star because the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. You will definitely dance to the wonderful flavors or India without breaking your wallet. We will be coming back to try the buffet.."}
{"text":"Ok food, poor service, over 2 hours to complete a lunch service.

I have gone to this place four times, twice for dinner (about $15/plate) and twice  for the lunch buffet ($13/plate). I will start out with saying the food is ok. Had the chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken). It is not the best in town but obviously good enough for my girlfriend and I to have gone back a few times. The real problems come in with customer service and issue resolution. 

My experience with one lunch at P2I - Called ahead to see if they had makhani chicken on the buffet, the said yes and disappointingly, they did not. Had a group of 8 that showed up at 11:30, well before the lunch rush. 6 had the buffet and 2 ordered from the menu (butter chicken ;-)). The food was not to temperature even though it took 30 minutes to arrive and we did not receive everything that we ordered. The buser refilled our Sprite with water and almost did it again.

We had to track down our waiter, like he was avoiding us, to ask for our bill. He was able to print out a bill and a receipt for the 2 that didn't get the buffet but for the rest, \"if you just put your cards in the booklet, I will run them for you\". Not a good idea. A business is required to provide that information to you prior to running your card plus they need a signature after the transaction. 30 minutes later still no bill or receipt. They were having POS issues (a little pun intended). All other tables had received a bill and have left at this point.

We asked for the manager and was not sympathetic to the fact that the food was not hot, we did not get all our food, the bill, and that his guests have to go back to work. No discount, nothing was removed from the bill, not even a coupon for next time. The biggest kicker... they still ended up charging 20% gratuity.

I will not be going back again and will not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good savory dishes that I love.  Lunch buffet is all you can eat and only 8 bucks and is an excellent quality.  It is a small hole in the wall tho, but clean inside."}
{"text":"I am from chennai, South India. I had a buffet few months back and the food was excellent. Worth the money. Also went for a dinner yesterday, was my wife's birthday. Once I looked into the menu I immediately thought to have masala Dosai, with the dream of at least match our South Indian style. Dosai served along with sambhar and coconut chatni. Was not good enough. Could not eat a full Dosai. Sambhar wasn't good. In case you wanna Dosai with South Indian style, need to double or triple think before ordering."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffet place in Charlotte. I was blown away by the variety of items they serve on such low price! Very authentic food!"}
{"text":"Disappointed :( food is average. Initially it felt that service is very good but the moment we ask for free desert which is deal on yelp ,their tone changed and it took them forever to get it .."}
{"text":"So good!  Don't let the easy-to-miss exterior fool you...the lunch buffet can't be beat.  For a low price you can eat your fill of fresh masalas and naan and chickpea wonders.  Always spend the next few days thinking that their lunch would be better than whatever I am eating.  Other people know about the food so try not to go at a peak lunch time because you'll compete for seats with a long line (but it is worth the wait).  I'd recommend this place to introduce anyone to Indian food!"}
{"text":"I dated a girl who lived in front of Passage to India and eventually got married to her. We went there several times and always enjoyed food! Food is prepared with heart! You will enjoy going there too..!"}
{"text":"Awesome Biryani and South Indian Food, not to mention, unbeatable prices. The Indo-Chinese was not so impressive."}
{"text":"Love the weekend buffet so much.  You need to be prepared to wait for refills.  To maybe wait for a table, especially if you're in a group.  Groups come here often, but they are a huge hassle.  It's pretty small.  I don't know how clean it is.

But I do know that there is an amazing variety of food, and that it all tastes wonderful.  It more than compensates for the less-than-stellar atmosphere.  My husband and I look forward to it all week.

Oh, and it's very affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time. The restaurant is a little large for them, so it felt empty, but the servers and waitress were so friendly and helped us with our order. 

We ended up getting Manchurian gobi for our appetizer and it was delicious! It's basically tempura cauliflower, and was delicious.  I'm not a cauliflower fan and I loved it. We also ordered the Saag paneer and the Lamb vindaloo. They were both great. We will definitely be coming back to try more. The portions were huge and we came home with two boxes of leftovers for lunch the next day and we ordered an extra Naan to go with it. I think I want to try the buffet to taste many options at once!"}
{"text":"Great food. Restaurant was clean and well kept in a nice area of town. Dinner menu has many options and they'll ask how spicy you want your food. Chicken curry was great! Server was running the register, seating guests, etc, but service was great as other members of the staff seemed to float around and help each other out. This place also delivers if you're in the area and don't want to go out. From what I could tell this was a popular option, as I saw many meals bagged up and ready to head out."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. 

Came here for the first time based upon solid Yelp reviews. Typically I go to another Indian restaurant a few miles up the street but decided to gamble on an unknown. 

Saturday. Lunch buffet. Noon. 
8-10 people eating when we arrived. 
When we left there at 1230 there was only 1 party left!
Table for 2

First thought upon entering- it's kinda warm in here - and it's only 75* outside!

Serving staff of 2 were very friendly and engaging! 

Food - decent to good. Not bad. Could be richer. Could be thicker (seemed more watery than the competition up the street). The goat was the best part; plenty of good-sized, meaty chunks. Garlic naan was hot, and good. Mango chutney was on point. 

Atmosphere - it's been stated before that the lighting could improve and I agree. Flood lighting that seems to be like spot lights. Read these reviews and adapt!!! Half way through the meal we had to request the air conditioning be turned down and it was then, making it bearable and comfortable. 

$2 Heinekens in draft. Yes! 

Might come back. Jury's out."}
{"text":"I and my boyfriend were here for dinner. They gave us little snack thing with sauces for an appetizer, and my boyfriend was almost about to eat yellow RUBBER BAND that was inside of a sauce. So we complained about it, it was disgusting as hell and was about to harm my bf's health. Saying sorry and letting kitchen staffs know this.. that was it. Be careful when you guys eat here! I left fairly enough amount tip for them for wishing them to be careful."}
{"text":"Great food! First time coming here and everything was better than expected. It's been a while since I've had this style of food and everything was cooked hot and ready. My girlfriend has been here before and she highly recommends it as well."}
{"text":"We come here for takeouts regularly. We have found the taste of the curry here to be better than some of the other Indian places in South Charlotte.   The dal fry and chattinad dishes are our favorites. However, the tandoori chicken and koftas were a little on the dry side. 

Would recommend getting their early if you plan to eat in, as they do get very busy especially during weekends for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp masala and white rice. It was delicious and great also the service was perfect. The interior was impressive and attractive. One of the best indian restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Indian cuisine for a long time. This place met all my expectations. I went there for a buffet on Sunday and got there about 15 min after they had opened. So, the food was fresh and delicious. Also, quite a good variety for a $10 buffet. Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressive at all.  Tandoori chicken was good but everything else mainly all dry and the curries heaped up with heavy cream.  Not for me again!"}
{"text":"Do not try Biryani hear...worst..! Felt like tomato rice. 
Waste of money not at all a Dum Biryani."}
{"text":"The paneer tika masala & chicken 65 are amazing and the people that work here are wonderful! The first time we came in we were served promptly, and attended to. I love northern Indian food ie shahi paneer, mattar paneer. I asked them what was equivalent. Happy the manager suggested the tika masala. It was great! We have come back once a week ever since. Great customer service, great people, yummmmy food."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I was going to say the chicken masala was my favorite but then every time I try something new its amazing...the spices, the flavor, I'd give a 10 star if I could."}
{"text":"I have had better at Woodlands but this was good. Heard they stopped buffet but don't know if it is true if so I am not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I rarely review anything..but I'm in Charlotte on business and the reviews were good & Passage to India was close to my hotel. While there's not much to be said for atmosphere or decor, the food was excellent..served quickly, fresh and piping hot. Perfect! I only wish they served alcohol."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat restaurant tucked away next to a gas station. The service and ambience were awesome. We were served food within 20 minutes of ordering. The food was great and not too spicy. I loved the Shahi paneer, rice and the naan. I came here for dinner and want to come here again to try the lunch buffet. I also see that one can get lunch boxes to-go with good amount of food for around 4 $ which is pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Good food. But no paneer with the palak. And you use styrofoam bowls for the chutneys and raita. Also, an employee was listening to a program in Spanish which was louder than the restaurant music. Felt like employees did not much care about the place...."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The price for the buffet is great! I go once a week. I'm only giving it four stars because the restaurant is small and when its crowded, I feel like they rush you out the door. Plus when I order a water, I feel that the waitstaff becomes rude to me. I never drink soda. It's not that I'm trying to be cheap."}
{"text":"This place has real poor standards. Pieces of glass and foil have been found in their food. Eat at your own risk or with attorney."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Marsala and Naan were amazing!   The service was amazing as well.   Everyone was very polite and accommodating.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Passage was through delivery.  My family ate every last bit of food that was delivered to our temporary corporate housing.  Personally, I had the tandoori platter and it was amazing.

My second experience was on a Saturday with another family.  We absolutely got our money worth.  Everything on the buffet was great.  The fried cauliflower is perfection.

I've been back several times with co-workers and everyone has had the  \"we have to go back\" comments.  

5 stars."}
{"text":"Maybe a little more expensive than one would imagine...

The lunch buffet is the way to go here. Delicious food though."}
{"text":"We eat Indian all across the country and In the UK but this is a great, dependable place in Tempe.  I had Chettinadu instead of my standby Vindaloo. It was a very pleasant change. The Chicken Tiki Masala did not taste or cut like normal chicken as it was so tender and flavorful. We were here 3 times during our several week stay. We tried 3 other Indian locations and THIS was the best. Service is only average but go for the food."}
{"text":"We got a vegetarian take out yesterday night.  The paneer kati roll was good. The aloo mutter and naan were ok, nothing to write home about. The ras malai was just awful, it was like the milk was burnt!
But the worst part of our night was that when we had ordered paneer tikka masala, we were given chicken tikka masala. we went home and started to cut the supposedly paneer in the entree, only to realize it was chicken. Now, it is understandable that the order got mixed up. But what irked me was that when I called them to tell about it, the owner acted like its not possible and that I was mistaken. Even though we are vegetarian, we know what chicken looks like. He was extremely rude and asked me to come all the way back to the restaurant to examine the dish himself or to email photos of it. I decided to do neither coz I was completely pissed at the way this was handled. I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't gotten my money back, but to treat a customer like this, all for $10 is unacceptable for me. Terrible way to run a business, and that too when it is new!
Anyway, we're never going back and recommend that people check their dish before eating it, coz they are never going to accept their mistake."}
{"text":"3 and a half stars. I went for the lunch buffet, which was relatively sizable compared to other Indian buffets I've been to. They also brought out garlic naan, which was delicious. The food was good, though I thought some of the dishes were missing the kick and flavor that I've had at other Indian restaurants and have come to expect. The price was reasonable as well - under $10. The waitress came around and filled my water regularly. Overall, it was a good experience, but not a great one. Good food, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Awesome food... Great service... One of my fav hangouts! 
The best food is served at lunch when they have the buffet. Also, their Gulab Jamuns (Sweet) is the best!"}
{"text":"The food was sooo good!  The spice was perfect.  I couldn't stop eating (I am so full)!  Even my husband, who was a little reserved at first because he's never been to an Indian restaurant, said that it was amazing."}
{"text":"The service was okay, the lamb curry was salty. If they would stop staring at us eat, creepy. If had better Indian food for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been on the lookout for a great Indian restaurant since we moved to Phoenix, and bonus points to the place that had the best saag paneer.  After trying several locations we finally got around to trying this place and it blows everybody else out of the water.  Their saag paneer is amazing and delicious, the service is always great and we are happy to have found our new favorite Indian restaraunt!"}
{"text":"Great lunch Buffett! Really nice looking restaurant also. Naan was perfect, everything tasted great. I'm getting hungry for more now :)"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Charlotte...period. Cannot go there without ordering the Eelam Calamari appetizer, Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan. The price for what you get is solid and so consistent in quality and taste every time.

The Buffet is great as well (but I do wish they offered the Tikka Masala on it more often.

Plus they deliver within a 6 mile area!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in tempe. My family and I have eaten here probably 10x since it opened and the food always impresses. It's never crowded and it's very quiet inside. The lunch buffet also had a huge selection and tastes really good. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate here with some coworkers again lastnight, and again the food was flawless along with the service!!! I couldnt eat anymore I was so full!!! We are so happy we found this little gem!"}
{"text":"One of the best indian food in AZ, which is hard to find a real delicious and great service,"}
{"text":"If there was a -10 star rating, I'd have given that. We eat out a lotttt. And being Indians, we have been eating Indian food all our lives. We never got sick eating outside food ever, because we eat out so much that our body got immured by now. But buffet at Passage of India today was one of the most terrible ones ever. The food was STALE for sure & both me & my spouse are sick in the stomach. Suffering really bad due to their old stale horribly tasting food. Unfortunately we also offered some naan to our 20mo son & we have been changing his diapers non-stop. Never going back!

Update: Went there 5hrs ago & we are still suffering big time. Now rushed to doctor who said we all have food poison including our toddler. Screw you stingy PoI management who were so cheap to use stale food to save a few bucks. We are vegetarians. How much did you save on our food, max $10 overall? But you lost customers who would pay $30minimum each time we could have visited if you maintained some quality. I hope FDA & health departments inspect you! We are leaving it with a review because we are not one of those suers. One day soon you'll get there if you continue such cheap tricks."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Indian food I have ever had. I come here on my birthday every year. I literally love it. The restaurant is always crazy empty....I am assuming most of their business comes from the lunch buffet. But WOW is this place good."}
{"text":"Buffet had a good assortment...not too spicy and not too mild.  The place was packed, but staff was attentive and kind."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere. Full bar and decent service. The restaurant is spacious and almost always fairly empty which is disappointing, but the food is actually spicy and tasty both. Tried many dishes, and am a special fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala and Aloo Matar, while the Naan is almost always perfectly cooked. Seriously, great food compared to almost any restaurant the valley has to offer."}
{"text":"Super awesome food. The chicken biryani is to die for. I cannot remember the number of times we have taken our food to go from here.

The kathi rolls are awesome too! I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to taste good flavorful Indian food.

So sad that we have now moved from the area and won't be able to take out as often :-("}
{"text":"Really good food and very nice staff.  I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.  Better than other Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place to have authentic North and South Indian dishes. Price for lunch boxes is outstanding...try buffet and dinner as well..."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced - good buffet, very tasty.  Thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Good variety of both dishes with meat and vegatarian."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Indian Restaurants in the valley and this is hands down the most consistently good one. Chana Masala and Malai Kofta were both perfect and the Naan were delicious. I will only be going here for my Indian food needs for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"The missing start is because luxury. But the good and service are 4+. There's the best day-to-day breakfast-luncn place to. This is a multicultural point because it's next to the North Carolina University at Charlotte. The place is quite and with a nice Indian background music))) The guys are so gently, so the service is perfect."}
{"text":"It is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. If you are a person who is only looking for quality and don't mind about the quantity, then this is the place for you around the University area."}
{"text":"This place rocks,     I have taken many out of town guests here and they have all said the same thing, EXCELLENT !  and quite the surprise ! 

I have never had bad food from here,  once I did take out and they made my Chicken Tikka Masala  to spicy,, I called just to let them know the kitchen made a mistake,     THEY insisted on driving me over a fresh order ! ! !    I went back instead, ,  since I only live a few miles away.   MY fresh order was waiting on me,,  AND a few extra things !  :)  

Im going tomorrow for take out !  Dang this made me hungry  LOL"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with this place, but nothing particularly redeeming either.  The food was mediocre, and the interior didn't seem to fit the theme.  The servers seemed aloof.   We were there for the lunch buffet which had an ok selection of the Indian standards.  The best part was a never-ending basket of your choice of fresh baked Naan."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on the Yelp recommendation. Lived up to the reputation: very good food, reasonable prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found insect in biryani ... Please avoid this. Sad part is manager's response after we complained about it. He said 'you must have brought those from outside'."}
{"text":"Favorite go-to place.  The food at Passage is always perfectly prepared.  The flavors and spices are so delicious.   Plenty of choices for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.  The servers are always kind and attentive.  Have never been disappointed and always order extra to take home for later."}
{"text":"I lived near this place for 5 years and just checked it out 2 months ago. Since that time, I've visited 3 times because it is delicious. The buffet is fresh and sits well with my sensitive stomach. I would suggest this place to people who like Indian food."}
{"text":"We live nearby and almost always get take-away.

Good and consistent quality of food, our faves include:  chicken makhni, chana masala, bhindi masala, chicken 65, mutter paneer, and peshwari naan.

Naan always seems fresh.  Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my wife while celebrating our anniversary. Couldn't have been better. The food was absolutely delicious and you get a lot of it. We ordered the dinner for 2 and still had plenty of leftovers. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great food at a good price."}
{"text":"The restaurant seems dead at times, I've been there 4 times and every experience was bad the food is not up to standards in my opinion. The restaurant just does not seem like a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"4 for food. 3 for ambience. Not a fancy place but a weekday dinner was calm and peaceful. Food is really really tasty !!"}
{"text":"Bad quality food very slow service because they only have two server baigan bharta very bad no taste"}
{"text":"We tried goat biryani, baingan bhartha, masala dosa, mango lassi, and two kinds of naan: garlic and plain.

The plain naan was OK, the garlic a bit on the uncooked side.

The bhartha and biryani were both rather greasy. The bhartha was also mushy in an un-bhartha sort of way while the meat in the biryani was somewhat tough, when we were expecting something that falls apart easily. 

The lassi was good, had some ground pistachios in it. The masala dosa was definitely sub-par. 

One of the rare places we've been to where most food was left uneaten AND we did not take any home. I think that says it all. Service is OK, if you plan to go there."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place, service is very slow, the food portions are very small, most of the food was either too greasy or undercooked."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly service! I got a lentil dish and my husband got goat tandoori and they were both delicious and full of flavor. They serve your meal family-style, which I think is fun. One word of warning: 'mild' 'medium' and 'spicy' are not quite comparable to Mexican food, and if you think you like hot, order medium! But to tame the heat, you can order a lassie (yogurt drink) or the waiter may feel sorry for you and bring you some yogurt sauce! Anyways, I highly recommend this restaurant. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Over priced and below average food. There are better Indian restaurants in Tempe. Mango lassi that we ordered was salty and watery, it was the weirdest mango lassi that I've had so far. The other dishes that we ordered were chicken tikka masala, malai kofta and chilly pakora. The chilli pakoras were soggy and not crisp at all and the other two were average.
 All and all I would give this place a miss for the next time."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for a wedding and ended up going out later for dinner.  Even at 10pm there were people in the restaurant.  One of the parties was a group of 10.  The server was polite and patient.  My salty lassi was great.  We also had a lamb samosa-type appetizer that was fresh and tasty.  We tried the poori and naan, best poori ever.  Naan was good too but is always good!  Lamb vindaloo and chicken makhni (my go to dish) were perfect.  Too bad I don't live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best. Indian. Lunch. Buffet. In. Charlotte. So far.

First off, f- all your reviews about rude Indian waiters. If you've been to India, you know what may come with the territory... heeheehee... Who doesn't love hole in the walls? I would only moan about the cleanliness depending on whether or not the food was good. And in this case, I don't complain.

There is also nothing that makes me happier then coming here and seeing 80% Indians eating lunch. If this is where all the Indians go, you know it's gotta be good. Dipping fluffy nan bread with their right hands into steaming hot curry.

I haven't tried anything but the lunch buffet, but I think it's incredible value. Everything is done properly, the rotis, idlys, the chana masala, the chicken curries, the raita, etc. There's usually 2 meat curries and 4 veg curries to choose from. Fresh salad (cucumbers to plonk into the raita) and fresh fruit for dessert.

What I'm saying is, know that this isn't gourmet Indian or out-of-the-box Indian. It's just plain average mama's Indian. Which to me, is perfect for a quick lunch. It's also tons better then overpriced Indian, or sad discolored Indian food. Like the Saag Paneer ain't the best you've tasted. But it's satisfying.

Prices:

    Lunch Buffet $6.99
    Weekend Brunch Buffet $9.99

Me happy. If you want a un-American eating experience, eat here. Crowded to elbows, people eating with their hands, stuffing your face, in, out, job done.

{"text":"I got a yelp account just to give this place five stars. I'm an Indian food addict. This place is the real deal. Excellent customer service, truly fantastic quality food. Also, incredibly cheap?

I tipped 25 percent cause I loved this place so much! Bounty of good food for the price!

Eat here! Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I can remember having. Certainly the best in AZ. Their Tikka Masala is phenomenal. The service is prompt and friendly. The bartender, Happy, is a great host. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area. It's even worth a trip :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We dine at Passage at least once per week. We enjoy everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The food tastes fine. The problem is that I ordered Mutter Paneer, which is peas and cheese in sauce... and there were hardly any peas. There were exactly 5 peas in a serving. For comparison, this is like ordering a pepperoni pizza, and there only being 1/2 of a pepperoni on your slice. It might be a great slice of pizza, but if it's missing the critical ingredient then it's not what you ordered. I called and Andy said he'd tell the cook next time to be sure to have peas in it and prepared to get off of the phone (what?? This is like telling the cook to make sure a pepperoni pizza has pepperonis next time and offering nothing to the customer) When I gently pressed, I was offered 25% off my next meal. Kind of expecting more recompense there. Probably won't be back. See photo if you would like to hunt for my peas."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tikka Masala (spicy) and Gulab Jamun. The Tikka was actually good and tasty, however it was not spicy at all even though I requested that. The Gulab was on point. The Naan was a bit dark and burnt though..

Overall I would order here again. Good food, good prices."}
{"text":"Dropped by for Sunday buffet. They vary the buffet, so no chicken tikka masala but biryani was great, as were the other dishes, including idli. Chai was good. Restaurant filled quickly. Service was very good. As another reviewer mentioned, not much conversation even with restaurant full."}
{"text":"Even though I had to give one star because Yelp doesn't let me post with zero stars, I will NEVER go back!!! went there in the evening on 01/23/2012 to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was a terrible experience.  The walls are riddled with muck and the cheap quality furniture is very uncomfortable, the staff is unfriendly even though there were no other customers there when we arrived! (Note to self: when you enter a restaurant and there's no one else dining there, turn around and exit!)

Now to the menu - be forewarned - there's NO alcoholic beverages or even sodas! Are you serious?  Yep.  The chicken vindaloo my wife ordered only had three pieces of chicken and three gigantic pieces of potato - that's it, for $11.00 - what a rip off.  My paneer curry was too sweet even after I asked them to make it spicy.  I'm indian and I like spicy food.  They couldn't even do that right.  We bought my grandson along too so he can celebrate grandma's birthday.  Poor kid took one bite of the dosa and didn't touch it after - he said it was too hard.  Sad to say, we all left the restaurant hungry and disappointed.  The staff didn't even have the integrity to apologize after we complained - what a dump. 

They think just because they're located near UNCC that they will always be profitable, but being cheapskates with food quality/quantity will not let them stay in business for long."}
{"text":"Delicious South Indian food....pay attention - the Mysore masala dosa is quite huge size for 1 person to eat alone. Idly was tasty as well. Sambhar nice and hot and so was the chutney - good. 

All in all a good dinner. Will be back here next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A true gem in the University area. There have been other Indian restaurants in the area and none of them can compete with this one. For lunch they have a buffet with a number of dishes to suit any taste including vegan and vegetarian. The buffet is on a rotation so some of the dishes change from day to day. Since it is a buffet I think they do not make the food as spicy so many people can enjoy it. Be careful, the food is so good you may accidentally eat way too much. For food this good you may expect to pay a lot but two people can get the buffet for $15 (or $10 if you get the takeout special). If you are unsure what dishes you would enjoy, go for the weekend \"brunch\" buffet. It is larger than the weekday buffet and includes some of their other Asian dishes as well. I have gone for the lunch buffet many times and have never had problems with the food (except when they can't keep up!), it has never tasted bad or been cold. 

They also have a large dinner menu which you can preview on their website and they even deliver. Of course the dinner menu is more expensive but they give large portions. I usually order butter chicken, vegetable biryani, and naan for dinner and have enough leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.

The dining room is rather small, around 15 tables, so if you go during a peak time expect to wait (but it's worth it!). The decor is simple and tasteful and the place is always clean. The waiters are very attentive and polite.

FInally a personal remark about the last time I was there... I used to go here at least once a week since I lived in the area. I have been away for a year and when we went back the other day the waiter remembered me! Even though I don't live as close as I used to I will go back as often as I can now that I'm back in Charlotte.

I hope this review has been helpful and convinces you to try Passage to India. Great places like this deserve the support of their community!"}
{"text":"F this stink hole.

Got there Sunday night at 920pm.
Sign on door says open til 10pm.
Google said open til 10pm.

Door was locked at 920pm.

Hope they have to shut this place down soon.

Idiots."}
{"text":"I have lots of Indian friends who cook for my family and I, so the expectation for Indian cuisine was very high. However, Passage of India was able to pull it off. The food was excellent, and the spiciness was not too bad (if you request mild). Also, the prices are very reasonable. For a party of 7, the bill was only $100, and we took home 3 to-go boxes. The only thing that really bothered me was that naan was extra,  and that there is almost no ice in the drinks. If you're looking for great food, Passage to India is the place to go."}
{"text":"Honestly , I've tasted better in the area. We arrived about 1pm on a Sunday. A number of items on the lunch buffet were empty except for the
sauce. Unlike many ethnic restaurants , our drinks were kept full. Overall flavor was good, but as mentioned I've tasted better in the area."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant near the University. The decor is authentic, as is the food. I ordered the chicken marsala, and of course, the garlic naan! Every bite was delicious. To end, I had fried cheese balls in a sweet honey sauce. Although this may sound somewhat repulsive, it was everything but! You have to try it! The restaurant is fairly inexpensive and great for college students. Be sure to get there early, as it does fill up quickly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are vegan and found Passage to India right down the street and decided to try it. Although there isn't a plethora of options for vegans it is still very good. The Chana Masala is very good as well as the Gobi Manchurian. Happy always helps us and he is always accommodating and encourages us to different options on the menu. We haven't tried the lunch buffet yet but I make it a point to. We love the service and the food, we are always welcome here. We now eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Good:
buffet ~ 10 on weekends
near IKEA"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  The best Indian food in town.  Be sure to get extra Naan Garlic Bread with your meal.  Nom Nom Nom!"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place. Everything is totally delicious and the buffet / lunchboxes are very affordable.  I mean....I can get lunch to go for $5-6! YUM."}
{"text":"great food! authentic, awesome bar and patio. Great atmosphere and good for large parties"}
{"text":"Very average food. Shaahi paneer was very  mediocre. 
 Didn't expected this type of food from a restaurant with 4 star rating."}
{"text":"The service is very bad. The are a few dishes which were good, like the Gongura mutton and Biriyani but the rest were below expectation and I dint expect much. It was very deserted, not for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Bad ambience. 1h wait for food when there were only 3 other tables with people. Bad quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Punjabi food.... Staff are warm and very welcoming.. Happy is awesome must visit him at the bar ..."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the Samosas and sauces I tried at the Dances of india 2011 Show at CPCC in April.  They were crispy on the outside and the potato/veggie filling had the right blend of spices. WONDERFUL!!!  I have yet to trek down to their restaurant which I plan to do when my family come for a visit to Charlotte from ATL this summer. From what I've read so far my family should enjoy the Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite Indian place in the valley. I've tried many, Indian is my favorite kind of food. I have came back to this one the most. This place has the best prices, because rice is included. Some places make rice a separate charge so the menu prices look cheaper than they are. The food isn't any better than others, but I come back because I feel welcome from the staff and the service is attentive and fast. I can't review the lunch buffet, but for dinner it is excellent. Chicken Tika Masala and Chicken Saag are my 2 favorites. Remember to get Garlic Naan too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants. My boyfriend and I used to frequent here often when he lived in Charlotte. I miss it. The prices are excellent, the food is amazing, and it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time at Passage to India. We have eaten dinner twice and enjoyed the buffet once. Every time has been wonderful. Tonight we had palak paneer and malai kofta as well as garlic naan. The malai kofta is the best we have ever had and my husband and I eat a lot of Indian food. The palak paneer was delicious as well. Last time we got everything hot, but it was really to hot for us (despite loving hot, spicy food), so we went with medium this time and that was perfect. One of our favorite things is the bar. When you order a margarita, they bring you your drink and 'extra'. It's like getting 2 drinks for the price of one. Service has always been great and we have gotten our food very quickly. Though we are not of Indian heritage, most of the clientele is.  Always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Please save yourself the trouble of a bad experience. Skip this one. It looks good on the outside  but has nothing else good about it.

My husband and I went  here at about 8PM . There was NO service , no usher . We should have left then but thought of giving it a chance. We went over to the bar and ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. The bartender gave us an amused chuckle and we asked him what was up . He said he had never made LIIT before!! And he s supposed to be a bartender for heaven's sake ! Though he was making drinks by checking out recipes on his phone,he insisted on making our drink . Came back in 5 minutes and said he doesn't have all the ingredients for the drink . Talk about a \"full bar\"!!! He gave us a weird drink and said he would charge us 7 bucks for it . The gobi manchurian came after an eternity , was cold and tasting weird again . Do I need to go on .. Bad experience ."}
{"text":"After discovering this place a little over a month ago, I've quickly become a regular - dining there probably once a week.  Atmosphere and food are great.  Servers are courteous, helpful and knowledgable.  I've enjoyed every meal thus far and look forward to going again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant.  The food  is a combination of Northern and Southern cuisine.  The Chicken Tika Masala is well seasoned, the naan is fantastic, I love the vegetable samosas.  I haven't had a bad dish from this restaurant.  What's really nice is on those evenings when you order take away the food is hot and it's just as good as if you'd been eating at the restaurant.  If you enjoy the flavors of curry and turmeric, you will enjoy this restaurant.  The best Indian food that I have found here in the valley."}
{"text":"Just had lunch buffet with wife for first time at this 3 week old new restaurant. Noticed several parties of East Indian descent eating there, so took that as a good sign. I gave it 5 stars for my goat dish, wife gives it 4 stars as she wished her chicken marsala had more spicey kick. Bare ambience, but food more important to me, so will come back to try dinner."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I ever had.
The Shai paneer is incredible.
You will not regret this one!
I have been here at least 25 times and have always left with a smile."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet and was disappointed with the quality of food. The Veg Biryani didn't seem fresh. The raita was too salty and the mirch ka salaan was too spicy. 
The pakodas, Mutter Paneer and the choice of garlic/butter/plain naan delivered to the table were good. The Gulab Jamun was okay but some were dry as they were fully immersed in the syrup. 

Ambiance and service were alright."}
{"text":"For this edition of Excited about Eating we visited Passage to India, located in the Campus Station Shopping Center in the University area of Charlotte. Now, I have to admit, I normally don't eat at Indian restaurants because I have heard the food is very spicy. But today we were up for trying something different.

We were in luck. Instead of choosing just one dish, we were able to experience multiple items from their lunch buffet, and many of them were very good. My favorite was the Chilli Fish, fresh tilapia marinated with spices, fried and tossed with bell pepper and onions. The fish was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. Dora here. Tilapia typically isn't a fish I'd choose, but I really liked this dish. Not too fishy and great flavor.

Another favorite was the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic & fresh spices and grilled in a clay oven. This dish was outstanding with the ginger and garlic shining through and the chicken carried a smokey favor. The Goat Curry, baby goat cooked in onion, tomato, and ginger gravy was great over the Basmati rice. 

My wife's favorite was the Chicken Tikka Masala, boneless chicken breast marinated in ginger, garlic, yogurt & spices and grilled in a charcoal clay oven. Dora here. The Chicken Tikka Masala was moist and tender, and sported just the right amount of heat. Unlike the Chicken Biryani which lit my mouth on fire! One taste of the Biryani and I was begging to switch my iced tea to diet coke. lol. And I really liked the Gulab Jamun, sugar-soaked balls shaped like doughnut holes, and that's what they tasted like: dense, sweet doughnuts. Ernie wasn't a fan. 

For dessert, we had the Mango Custard, made with fresh fruits. Not too sweet but just the right amount of fruit in a creamy milk sauce. Dora here. The mango custard was light and refreshing, not too heavy after eating from a buffet. And that's another thing. Normally, buffets leave me stuffed and bloated, but neither of us felt that way when we finished eating.

Overall, this experience was enjoyable and I would eat Indian food again. I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant that serves great food.

{"text":"Honestly, the food tasted great when we were there eating it. But it totally made me sick to my stomach the next day. I definitely got food poisoning from this place. Real bummer because it was actually tasty, but I won't ever go back there with peace of mind. Just can't do it. Maybe they had a bad day, but I really don't want to find out again, so consider this  your heads up."}
{"text":"An excellent, no frills dining experience. Good service, exceptional food. My two friends and I came for dinner on a Saturday. Surprisingly, it was not crowded so we were seated immediately. The menu has a good selection of items including vegetarian dishes. I assume a number could also be vegan or made vegan. I ordered the lamb korma (spicy), and it was very good. The right amount of heat and very flavorful. The serving size was generous, and we ended up full without an appetizer. Overall, worth the time and money for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for Passage To India, I compare every Indian restaurant to Woodlands and It's hard to match that level of quality.

Everyone else's reviews raved about the buffet, but I was here for dinner on a Tuesday. I will definitely try to make it out to the buffet if I'm in University at lunch time.

I had been here years ago when the place was Udipi, it doesn't seem like much has changed. 

We split the CHILLI PANEER appetizer. It was good. I definitely liked it more than my boyfriend but I'm a sucker for any Indian food with lots of paneer. The texture of the panner in this app is a lot like tofu with almost a sweet and sour type sauce over top. Served on a bed of mixed greens, rather like a salad.

I tried the MUTTER PANEER as my entree. I told the server I wanted it at a medium level of spicey, but it was pretty mild. Maybe I looked like a sissy and he didn't think I could handle it? :] I was still happy with my selection.

My boyfriend ordered the MUSHROOM PALAK, which was okay, Nothing special, nothing bad.

We shared POORI BREAD and GARLIC NAAN. Not the best we'd ever had, but still yummy."}
{"text":"After a great workout this morning at the Y....I was very hungry and had an intense desire for naan...and other great Indian goodies.  It has been sometime since I had gone to Passage to India for lunch.  We were pleasantly surprised that they had the buffet open until 3PM.  We considered other locations as we drove from the north side to the east.
I am glad we decided on P2I.  It was really great.  The rice, the curries, tandoori chicken, everything all so very good!   Now if we could just have gotten some mango pudding for dessert, we would have been so so so happy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Garlic naan was on point, as was the samosa chat and tandoori house platter. All reasonably priced. 
They grossly underestimated how long it would take for the food to be ready, but it was still worth the wait. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch.....so disappointed......no more weekday buffet. The lunch special was limited to two vegetable choices and two chicken curry choices. They had vegetable rice on the menu but it wasn't available today. The plain basmati rice was cold and hard. Not coming back. Now I have to look for another Indian buffet place for my weekday lunches. :("}
{"text":"Finding an Indian restaurant in my new city was on the top of my list. I found this place on a Saturday cold night and we couldn't just passed by, specially when u see so many good reviews on Yelp. We enjoyed the food so much, even my one year old who has been tasting Indian food since he was in mama's belly, enjoyed it so much. They made the Tikka Massala no spicy for him and still had that delicious Indian kick. It is not close to my place but I see myself driving just to keep trying the food at this place."}
{"text":"Ok my rating purely based on the lunch buffet that I am eating right now. I did arrive by 1 pm that's 90 before close. 
Most of the items were sitting there and had no freshness or the the taste you will expect. Britain was just ride and small chicken piece while the rice had drive Ed and become hard. Gram lentil (Chana daal) had twice the amount of salt. Goat curry was probably prepared from frozen so it just microwaved hot and in thick gravy no freshness there either. I tried eggplant (baigan bharta) no freshness there either. Naan was not crisp but again probably sitting in over (pre made). Kheer (rice putting) was simple rice and milk. No dry fruits or condensed milk flavor or even elaichi. Gulab jamun were hard dried and no syrup has gone in them. 

There was just one girl visible doing food runs and could not get the water to the table so had to remind again. 

Having said that, I have had better experience. At dinner time. Both food, drinks and service. But buffet sucks big time. Lesson learnt."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  Clean restaurant and got an A on their health inspection grade. That is really important. Food selection is decent and the taste is good too.  Not the best I have had. But not the worst. A plus is that not everything is killer spicy, so it is still edible. The tandoori chicken is really good."}
{"text":"This is definitely our go-to Indian restaurant for lunch buffet!!  A  ton of different options with a wide array of flavors with depth and rich spices.  If you love Indian food, you need to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst. Ironically, poor service from friendly waiters. Took forever to order, took forever for the food to come out. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is dark and empty... I ordered spicy chicken tikki masala. It was a bit oily, heavy, and greasy but that comes with Indian food."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian, so luckily Yelp helped me out by recommending this spot. I'm a UNCC student, so they're located so close to the school. I ordered takeout which consisted of 
* Chicken Tikki Marsala (spice level 8) ranging 1-10
* Garlic Naan 

The Chicken Marsala comes with a side of white rice. I'm a big spicy fanatic so when I had tried the Chicken Marsala it was incredible. There was so much flavor and I've never ordered something where the spice level was actually catered to my liking. Putting the Marsala on the Naan is probably the ultimate combo. 

Overall, I was really happy with my takeout. I just dropped the rating one star- because I had to wait a little longer than preferred to receive my takeout order when the restaurant didn't seem busy at all. I will be back though!"}
{"text":"Even as an international student on a tight budget, I was able to be a regular at this restaurant. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! I've been eating here at the lunch buffet twice a week for almost two years and I've never seen them run out of anything. The staff is highly professional and take care of you well. 

This is a fantastic restaurant. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Chicken Tikki Masala is so yummy. Get it every time and it never disappoints. The garlic nan is also one of my favorites, goes great with this dish. Portions are large so be prepared to have leftovers!"}
{"text":"I love Shahi Paneer, and vegetable biryanai here. I never been to this place but i ordered food from this place couple of times. Decent delivery time and sufficient food. Prices re pretty reasonable. Would recommend people to try once."}
{"text":"We get take out from here often, because everything we have ever ordered is PHENOMENAL. Seriously fantastic, multi-layered flavors, and all dishes are prepared to perfection, including all the sides (rice, samosas, bread). They use large prawns, and they are not stingy with them! 

We have tried a couple Indian places in Tempe, and nothing else comes close! 
The only downside is, their website is a bit user-unfriendly. Not easy to use, especially on a smartphone. If you manage to navigate through that, (or just call, they'll help you over the phone), you will be in Indian Food Heaven!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that I love indian food so when my favorite indian restaurant was closed I decided to try someplace different I came across passage to India and man to my surprise was the food good The lunch buffet was very good lots of selections to choose from and everything that I tried was very tasty I would highly recommend getting passage to India I try"}
{"text":"Spicy and Flavorful! Generous sized portions. Amazing happy hour specials from 5pm to 7pm. Beautiful Indian music. Bernadette, our waitress provided exceptional customer service! This was a wonderful dining experience. I love this place!"}
{"text":"First time to Passage To India. tried their lunch buffet got there around 12.30. as i approached  i noticed quite a few cars. that was a postive sign.As i entered i noticed the upper level was packed out, and the lower level had just one booth open. i was promptly seated and proceeded to the buffet. i got a few items and some salad with two chutneys mint and tamarind. i ate and went back for a second round. the food was fine but for me it was lacking. no chilli peppers and most of the items that i could eat (im a vegetarian) were all in cream or cheese sauces. a little bit of that is ok with me,but its not my favourite. their were not many vegetarian options at all. the majority of the buffet items were meat. i never recieved a dosa or any bread. thats really not a big deal. i enjoyed very much the atmosphere. i tend to prefer to be left alone unless i need some thing and in this case. i was not in need of any thing. the waittress was very likable and brought me water as i requested. over all not a bad experience. just dont think ill be coming back here any time soon. And I really was hoping I would be a huge fan."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday afternoon and not for a buffet but they told that I can order ALA carte only till 2PM. Well it was not mentioned anywhere in the menu so I would expect this to be updated on the website somewhere.

Regarding food, I took a lunch box as I could not go anywhere else, paneer was good and malai kofta was Ok. 
Good that the staff was courteous. May be next time I increase the rating but for this time all in all its a 3."}
{"text":"Came a few weeks ago and meant to post. I typically roll with Indias Oven in Gilbert,  but decided to try something a little closer.

The food, was actually pretty good. That's where it stopped. I've seen more lively staff at Morturaries. Seriously 

Service, slow. 12 mins for the Emo waitress to come over and sadly take our drink order. 

\"Buffet at lunch, not now\" Ok thanks Emo chick, we came for dinner. (7pmish)

Waiting 15 mins for drinks and someone to take our order when we heard a ruckus. Owner had to forcibly remove some guy from the bar area, he called the cops, but didn't come by to apologize or ask if we had been helped.

Place was pretty empty. Emo chick took order, and brought the food with as much personality as dry toast on the side of the road.

We ate a few bites before asking for a to go boxes, paid and left. No personality. For 65 plus tip, I think not."}
{"text":"First time dining here and we were not disappointed. We tried this place out bc of the total number of reviews which were mostly positive. We ordered the garlic naan and the Kashmiri naan. Both were very tasty! Entrees included chicken tikki masala and the lamb rogan josh with medium spice for both. The dishes had just the right amount of heat. Service was very good too. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Indian lunch buffets of south Charlotte, so I jumped at the chance to try one in the university area.  I'm glad I did.

Not only was the food delicious and the service good, I got to try some dishes I had never had before.  One with grated paneer cheese and tomato sauce was very tasty.  A yogurt dish with garlic and a variety of savory spices was also excellent.  I meant to go back and find out the names of these dishes, but the place was packed, with a long line at the buffet when I was leaving and I didn't want to be in the way.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our plan was to grab Indian with another couple. Then we told a couple of fiends and next thing you know, 9 of us show up at 6:30 on a Saturday night. The staff was great and attentive, but the place was pretty empty. We ordered some appetizers and all were great. Especially the cauliflower and paneer. Side Note: always bring one vegetarian, it forces you to order things you normally wouldn't. 
I've eaten here before and what I liked was the variety of dishes from across India. Something for everyone. I had lamb, yummy. The wife had tandoori chicken that was cooked perfect. My son had chicken tikka masala. So good. 

Everything was heavily seasoned, which I like. Medium spicy was just that. A bit of heat but not \"get me a Mango Lasi\" hot. Good beer selection as well. 

Everyone had a great meal and we will enjoy the leftovers for lunch today. 

This is one of those places that many people drive by all the time and \"want to try it\". Give it a shot, be adventurous. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We live about a quater of a mile for this place . We always order take out so I cannot speak to the other in dining experiences. the sauces are always spot on.  If you happen to order a chicken dish, you have to ask for white meat  or you get dark meat which I don't like and find rather slimy...again, for what it is, which is not a curry house in London and tempe is not NYC or San Fran it's a good solid option Americanized Indian cuisine. Of all the places I have been to here in az, the place is about on par with the other places that I would consider good, India house, royal taj etc. this is just closer to my house and being that it's about the same, passage to India gets my business... Truly I have never had real Indian food in az that has not been Americanized in some way...just saying. Tasty food overall."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in Charlotte. The Indian food is very authentic. I HIGHLY recommend going during lunch hours, paying a flat fee, and enjoying the all-you-can-eat buffet. The chicken tikka masala is out of this world.

The service is great, no complaints with the staff - the only issue is that you usually have to wait to be seated. It's a popular place, so there's typically a wait - especially for dinner.

Dinner can get very pricey as they charge per dish, again I recommend going during lunchtime and just doing the buffet instead.

Overall, this place is highly recommended. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Weekend lunch buffet is totally worth it, even though it's not extensive or overly ambitious. There is always enough to make me full and happy. There are at least 6-8 veg items, including rice, daal, Chinese fusion noodles, 2 curries, fried onions and a chaat bar. Their chutneys are good and plenty and the naan is refreshed often. 

The prices are very reasonable, less than $10/person for the buffet. 

The interior is small and crowded. If you are unlucky enough to get a table in the middle, expect the buffet line to wind next to your table. Don't wait to be presented with the bill; you might sit there for a while. Just head up to the register and tell him what you had and you'll get checked out a lot faster."}
{"text":"I went here Friday for lunch.  Great buffet with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.  The food was good.  When they seated me, they asked what type of bread I wanted.  They brought fresh Naan - absolutely delicious!!!

Good buffet, good price, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was very good. We stuck to the vegetarian dishes, I was pleased to see a mushroom dish which was fantastic.  The naan was good, the samosas were excellent. I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I had lunch buffet here . I went quite late so can't really complain about the food availability in the buffet . Taste of food was  not great but average like every other indian restaurant . but their veggie dum biryani is really awesome ... Staff was very polite and kind . Ambience was also good..

May be I  ll try this place again for dinner but not for buffet .."}
{"text":"The most distasteful behavior. They treat you like they are doing a favor to you by giving you food. Most unprofessional service. The waiters are so arrogant and unpleasant."}
{"text":"This place is hands down awesome. Ghe only thing i would improve is make it bigger. This place has to make a killing especially during lunch with the buffet setup.  Reccomend #64."}
{"text":"New place, very good. 

Food was really good, their Happy Hour prices were also very appealing. 

I tried the Biryani which was very tasty and just the right amount of spicy. 

I have also tried their masala dosa which was perfect. Usually with Indian places that have both North Indian and South Indian food you usually have to settle for one. They have a 2 chefs, one that does the North Indian dish and the other one does the South"}
{"text":"So... I was craving Indian food and searched for somewhere new and came across passage to India in the university area.
Hit or miss?
COMPLETE MISS.
As it was my very first time there, I walked in on a busy Saturday afternoon around lunch time. I was quickly seated at the only booth available and that was it.
No server showed up, no menu placed down... I looked around and saw a buffet, I wasnt sure if that was the only option? 
(Its my first time here and no one informed me of anything).
 Or if I was to wait forever until I received a menu? 
Either way- this place I ventured out to wasn't worth my business. 
We walked out and went somewhere that was WORTH our business,  the Thai house!! 
I got the pineapple curry chicken!
 It was delicious and satisfied my craving! Along with excellent service! Take some notes passage to India,  or shall we say passage to rude service??"}
{"text":"Delicious! We've been here a couple times. Once for dinner and once for their lunch buffet. Both times were excellent. I love that the buffet offers so many vegetarian options. Since I'm not very familiar with Indian Cuisine, the buffet let me try a little bit of everything!  Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"First review I ever make here in Yelp, but I felt like I had too.
My husband and I just came back from having a GREAT dinner at this restaurant.
It was clean, yuuummmyyy food, great service and the prices are good!

I would highly recommend this restaurant!!

:)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since i had Indian Buffet, there aren't too many options in Chandler. I was having some craving for it, though, so i decided I'd have lunch there since my kiddo was with grandma for the after noon. 

The place inside is nice, good decor, dark and a little intimate. The gal that seated me and attended to me was friendly and prompt with water and picking up after my plate. 

The buffet had many options, which i was a bit impressed with that finding.  I can't remember what all they had but i had several meat dish options and several meatless ones as well. I didn't get to try all of them but i did put on my plate at least 5 things to taste. I enjoyed the flavors of all but can't say any of them made me want to get up and keep going. ..except the spinach. .i really really liked that dish. 

I think i always compare Indian buffets to the only one I've ever eaten at consistently and for the longest period of time: Delhi Palace. This tikka masala was not as good as DP,  nor was the Tandoori chkn.

I think their gulab jamun is canned ;'-( here. .. they were not perfectly round, but dented like the kind bought the other day from the local Indian market.  That was disappointing :(

Overall: I'd come back if i wanted a conveniently located solution to my Indian cravings, but it likely isn't my go-to spot like DP."}
{"text":"Passage to India has the absolute BEST korma and tiki masala that you will find in the Valley. Their spices translate into amazing aromatic flavors with each bite. We have family that drive down from Central Phoenix for and Arcadia for their Korma. I have traveled to the UK many times for business and compare Passage to India to any UK Indian Restaurant (England and Ireland). Their Naan Bread is also amazing-I prefer the Garlic Naan. \"Happy\" is the bartender and son of the Chef and they have this down. We are going to have it for dinner tonight to watch the NCAA Championship. PS-try their Rice Pudding for dessert too!"}
{"text":"We went there after seeing the reviews on Yelp while driving back from Washington DC. The staff was quite nice and waited for us till the time we decided.
Food was great and tastier then we we expected. Chana masala and Naan was awesome.
If you are looking for great taste food at low price, this is the place. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch several times.  They have very nice selection in the buffet.  The lunch time service could be much better...Especially with their memory.  I ordered garlic nann,  plain nann was delivered instead - no big deal.  I have witnessed newly arriving customers getting served before the prior customers.  A few little things that add up.

The food is good from mild to spicy...something for everyone vegetarians and non-vegetarians."}
{"text":"Hmmm so I went there with my girlfriend and we had very different experiences... 

Food - I liked the food... the chicken tikka masala was probably one of the best that I've had in the valley and the garlic naan was pretty good. However, for whatever reason my gal had really bad stomach aches after eating there. I was perfectly fine... I do tend towards the carnivore dishes though where she is more vegetarian. She really didn't enjoy the experience...

Service - the service was marginally acceptable, once we got their attention they were responsive but there wasn't the usual proactivity that you would expect.

Ambiance - it was fine for a lunch time experience... and there were a good number of people for lunch on a Thursday."}
{"text":"I would say the lunch buffet is 3 stars simply because I like my food spicy and boldly flavored, and lunch buffets are much milder and lack that oomph. 

That said, ordering dinner portions or ordering to-go is a 4 star experience, so that's what I'm basing my review on. 

When I asked them to make it super spicy, they did not disappoint. On a price-to-quality ratio, this place nails the mark. I spend about $40 on a Door Dash order (the only way you can have food delivered from here) and I had enough food for about 4 meals. 

Overall, I recommend this place and will be treating it as my go-to for spicy Indian food. I think the other Indian restaurants around here are not as good on the price-to-quality ratio. Example - The Dhaba has really good food, but their portion sizes are really skimpy and they charge too much for those tiny portions.

Pro Tip: If you want delivery and you are a 1st time Door Dash user, you can often get a promo code to save some money. I got $7 off when I made my first order."}
{"text":"Been there for Sunday lunch buffet and had quite a good spread. But nothing was fresh/ tasty. Everything was cold despite of food warmers. Not going to come back again. Couldn't eat anything! Could improve on appetizers and desserts too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. This place is a real hidden treasure in the University City."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday the buffet was sub-par, I was very disappointed and unimpressed with the menu on the buffet, seemed like they cut the buffet menu in half. This was one of my favorite Indian restaurants!"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is TERRIBLE!  I've ordered delivery twice from them.  The first time the driver got so angry and yelled at me over the phone because he couldn't find my house.  My house is in the city, in a neighborhood with a street light right in front of my house, not difficult to find.  When he arrived he shoved my food at me and stomped off without a word.  The second time I ordered on a Friday night, their website says they're open until 11:00 and delivery orders are accepted until 10:30.  I work at a restaurant and I got home late, so I placed my order shortly after 10:00, plenty of time before their 10:30 cutoff and 11:00 closing time.  The driver arrived around 10:50 and told me, VERY rudely, that if ever want them to deliver again I need to call earlier because they need to have time to clean up.  They still weren't even closed yet!  Why is calling almost an hour before they close still not early enough???   If my restaurant turned people away an hour before we closed because we need to clean, I can't imagine we'd be open for business too much longer.  If you don't want to be open until 11:00 then change your hours of operation, don't have your website tell your customers one thing and you say another."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant and we went with a group of 18 people late (around 9:30).  They were short on help, but still accommodated all of us.  There are a few reviews about food on Yelp, but from what everyone tasted during our dinner is definitely encouraging.  Chicken Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala were excellent and this place has Hyderabadi Dum Biryani which was great.  Definitely has a mix of South and North Indian dishes on the menu.  They are new and still making adjustments, but definitely worth giving them a try... i would!!"}
{"text":"Nestled into a two story strip mall close to UNCC, Passage to India is easily accessible and great for a quick bite and has a lunch buffet available as well.

We had garlic naan which was quite good and a red onion chutney that was tasty as well.  I also tasted samosas for the first time and I loved the outside pastry, and the jury is still out on the contents, mainly because of the texture of the mixture, not really the flavor.  Our entree was a vegetarian dish with okra that I didn't write down the name of, but it was actually quite good and seasoned well and not too spicy.

I wasn't overly impressed with our service as my glass was never refilled during our visit, and I'm not sure if I'd dine in again, but might consider takeout to try some of the other offerings because of it's proximity to my house."}
{"text":"First timer today. Found them on yelp. Amazingly good! So happy to find it! As a chef if 20 yrs, I can be uber critical. I came for lunch buffet. Everything was fresh and delightful. Service very friendly. You surely can't beat the price either! Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome indian food! Finally a place I like. Awesome service, great prices, buffet & to-go lunch boxes are great! Owner Andy is a nice guy as are his wait staff. We drive a long way to eat here."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here, but I called in an order and when I got in, a portion of my order was missing even though the person on the phone repeated it 2 times back to me. I had to wait for the rest of my order there about another 10 minutes, but didn't get any type of hospitable treatment since it was an inconvenience. Seeing as I was waiting I asked them if they could honor a yelp deal that had been offered but I was met with a round about \"no\" and that was it. Good food...customer service let me down this time"}
{"text":"Delivery service and management is terrible. I've always dined in and ordered food from this place but last night I had the worst experience. 1) The food took 2 hours to be delivered. 2) I called the place 3x to see what the hold up and and they hung up the phone twice! What kind of decent establishment would do that? I understand that traffic jams happen all the time but seriously, hanging up on a customer? That's simply rude."}
{"text":"Good meat dishes great naans and dosa but not a lot of good veg options and the desserts are just ok"}
{"text":"Nice place..Loved the Paneer chettinad and Kashmiri naan...Absolute delight.."}
{"text":"This is the only Indian restraunt except for mall food courts that I've been to.  As others have said the place is small and dimly lit.  However, the lunch buffet is yummy and filling.  Been many times."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We were visiting from out if town. My husband said they had the best mango Lassi he ever had. For dinner we ordered an assortment of naan, mango lassi, saag, tikka masala, and vegetable lo mien. Service fast and portions were big! Which was great because we had a toddler. I wasn't expecting to really like the lo mien I just ordered it because my toddler loves noodles; but I couldn't stop eating it. We loved it!"}
{"text":"An experience that is quite literally a passage to India. Everything from the people to the service and the food were amazing!  I've been desperately craving Indian food after being in Vietnam for 2.5 weeks, and decided to fire up yelp for some help. Once again yelp community, you do not disappoint! With over 20 different items on their buffet, I HAD to try everything. And then, of course, I had to go back for my favorites. It's literally been over 24 hours and I am still stuffed! The dishes were intense and flavorful, exactly what is expected of an Indian restaurant.. and all for $10.99! I also learned that you could get a to-go box with a rice and 2 curries for either $5 (vegetarian) or $6 (non-vegetarian). Now, how do I get them to open another restaurant near work..? 

The restaurant is fairly quaint and stayed packed the whole time I was there with constant lines out the door. I was pretty excited about snagging my plates before the table of 10 went up for their share lol Just to put into perspective how delicious this place is, I didn't even THINK about taking pictures until after we left because I, apparently, just inhaled my meal. I'm basically going to live here now. Thank you yelp for another yummy discovery!"}
{"text":"I am going to make this short since I don't have a lot of time.  This is HANDS DOWN the best Indian i have ever had.  The buffet is what I eat and it is always hot and delicious.  They switch up the items a little bit and everything is clearly labeled.  

It isn't an extremely pleasing to the eye but the food is top notch and definitely several cuts about Persis (gross)."}
{"text":"Thank you for the Paneer tikka masala half tray I picked up on Sunday (2/11/2018). Found out about this place through a friend that lives in Charlotte in the summer of 2017... I live in South Carolina when it comes to eating Indian cuisine this is my go to place (yeS I drive 50 minutes to an hour) and yes I pass Persis (used to be my favorite till Passage to India came into my life) and the numerous restaurants in the Pineville and Ballantyne area to get to The Passage to India !!
Chicken tikka masala, the goat biryani, chicken vindaloo(must have)... just to mention a few. I've only been here too many times... new to yelp I figured Passage to India gotta be my first review!!!

PS. Thank you Victor... you have never disappointed when ever I order half tray catering orders on a short notice.... always came through!!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Did not like lamb curry tho but their buffet is really good.  Best Indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Passage to India is essentially 2 awesome restaurants in one: a wide ranging, well-tended buffet at lunch and a great dinner spot with an exhaustive menu. You would be smart to try either, genius to try both.

At lunch, for under $10 you get your run of the buffet table which usually consists of at least two kinds of rice, paneer dish, at least two other veggie dishes, tangine chicken and two other wet entrees, plus salad. The choices are never allowed to go empty and can rotate so it may be worth a second pass if you are still hungry...or if your taste buds insist. The chicken tikka masala is often on the table and has a great flavor.

For dinner Passage to India is my perfect hole-in-the-wall dining experience. There are many choices for each of your main categories, be you chicken, lamb, veggie, or seafood lover. I love the Hydrabadi Keema (Indian hot, of course) which has a deep flavor and practically leaves me licking the serving bowl.

The service is okay. Not overly attentive, but they don't leave you hanging. Like I said, I love the hole-in-the-wall feel but if you are looking for a classy date spot the atmosphere might not be what you want. If that's the case though, bookmark Passage to India and go later. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Oh yum - this place is just deeeelish! I'm always on the search for really good Indian restaurants and this has quickly become my favorite. It's a nice set-up, with friendly servers and complete with a bar. The food is fantastic. We usually go for dinner and have ordered a number of dishes. The prawns are always large, the chicken tikka masala is divine and the naan is perfect. Tonight we tried the chicken makhani (spl?) and the chicken andhra. They were both just fantastic. You could taste the grilled, chardness of the chicken in the makhani. And the depth of the flavors in the andhra were amazing. The makhani is quite a rich dish and the andhra was served chicken none in (which keep in mind gives you really tender meat). Don't give this place a miss. Josie the server is always super pleasant and very knowledgable about the menu!"}
{"text":"I have tried Indian food in various places and nothing really ever did it for me. My wife convinced me to swing by Passage one night for some take out. I ordered the Tikka Chicken Masala for the benchmark critique. Wow, I was hooked. Since then I have been back several times. The menu is full of great tasting options including great vegetarian dishes for the common meat eater (I have 2 vegetarians and 1 vegan in the house. They all love this place.) Try the Manchurian Gobi, best cauliflower ever. The service is good and the food is consistent. This is one of the gems."}
{"text":"If you find yourself around Harrisburg, and you like Indian cuisine, this is definitely one you should check out. As an UNCC alumni, I know my way around this area well and there really isn't much on this left-front corner of campus. It really can be hard to spot at first, as it is wedged in the Campus Station shopping center.

This place has a pretty sweet buffet. Although I've gone here once, I highly enjoyed their food options and felt it was an average size buffet. The food was of overall decent quality and the service was very tentative. I'm sure most items ordered off the menu are equally as good as what was available in the buffet.

The location is not a bad walk from campus. The lunch buffet runs until 3p, 3:30p on weekends. The business delivers and takes orders online."}
{"text":"I love Indian food that's spicy and full of flavor. I came here for the first time with my family after hearing about them rave about it multiple times, and I definitely believe this is some of the best Indian food in the valley. 

When we first arrived on a Friday evening at around 5:30 PM, the restaurant smelled amazing and the place was relatively empty. I ordered the chicken tika masala, and it did not disappoint! You have the choice between mild, medium, and hot masala sauce - be careful if you order the hot and you're not used to spicy! The dinner portions were huge (I probably could have shared mine with my sister), and I definitely enjoyed everything along with their buttered naan.

This will definitely be the place that I visit when I'm craving Indian food. I just wish that they'd fix their website so that I could order online. It'd definitely be a lot easier and more convenient."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down. The place is tiny, but it is packed with goodness. The flavors in this restaurant have me craving it constantly. The price for the lunch boxes is outstanding, but try the buffet and dinners as well. Ridiculously delicious."}
{"text":"I decided to try them again with delivery and this time was even better!! I went with butter chicken and it was amazing with garlic naan. Service on the phone was as usual kind and convenient."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and great size dishes.  Always surprised it isn't busier.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great informative service.  Great vegetarian selection.  Had the Naan with Indian cheese, Mirchi ka Salan Aug the hottest curry and somasas"}
{"text":"I've been to Passage To India about four times and every single time I've been there, I'm maybe one of 3 other diners. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food so I'm not the best critic and can't tell you why the restaurant is so \"dead\". I couldn't tell you what all I've had, but it all seemed to be good.  I've been twice with just my husband and twice with another couple and they're pretty accommodating.  I do not like spicy foods and their medium is pretty good - Just enough to \"tickle my tongue.\" I'll probably be back, only because they're in my neighborhood and I would like to return to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very poor food. Not at all authentic food. Ordered Paneer chilly, it was very oily and undercooked."}
{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant in Charlotte. Lunch buffet is very good and cheap..."}
{"text":"I love this place.
I usually sit at the bar and chat away with the bartender who could be part owner Im not sure. He is very friendly and taught me all about where IPA's come from. there basically a rotten ale that was soured to make the trip to India. take that you crafty bastards, lol..
The food is always fresh and is priced fairly. The chicken curry is bomb . it puzzles me why it is not busier. I wish passage to India the best and hope they are around for a long time"}
{"text":"Apparently there is a large Indian population in the Charlotte area, which worked out splendid since my husband, off his diet, was craving some Indian food and there were plenty of choices.

For the record, I'd give the restaurant 3.5 stars if possible - the food is very good!

We kindof ordered a feast. Embarassing. 

Samosa's, chicken 65, gobi manchurian dry, chicken tikka masala and butter naan. 

The samosa's were pretty good but a little dry. They came with the standard red tamarind (sweet!) sauce and green minty sauce. I always prefer the green one, no exception to this rule here. The chicken 65 was goood! 

Gobi manchurian was anything but dry. Litterally, it was super wet. The non-dry must just be drenched in sauce or something because the dry was anything but. Still tasty but it gets a little soggy - which is not exactly my preferred texture for cauliflower.

The chicken tikka masala was good albeit a bit sweet. I was also so full at this point that I didn't eat all that much of it. The butter naan was hot and fluffy and cloud like.. it's what bread dreams are made of."}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite Indian restaurant!  I travel a lot and have had good and bad Indian food.  Passage to India hits a home run.  The restaurant is very clean and \"Happy\" is happy to greet you.  Whatever you order, get the naan. Try a couple.  I love the butter, onion and cheese naans.  This is some of the best naan out there. 

The dishes can be ordered spicy, which I prefer. There is enough heat that you feel it but it doesn't drown out the flavor. The flavors are amazing!  I tried the Chicken Andhra Curry for the first time and it is full of different flavors that had my head spinning it was so good.  The goat and lamb dishes are delicious.  

**But if you can only get one dish, get the Chicken Tikka Masala, you will thank me. I don't know how they do it, but the chicken is some of the most tender white meat I've ever had.  I'm drooling thinking about it.

I've turned several friends onto Passage to India and they LOVE IT!  Go now, thank me later."}
{"text":"Went there a half hour ago on 12/23/2016 at 5:30PM and found the restaurant CLOSED! That destroyed our family meal out! On yelp it was stated OPEN 5PM to 10PM . Sign by door stated closed for kitchen redo. I suggest calling them first as it will be closed for a week or so. Just checked online: http://www.passagetoindiaaz.com to find no notice of closure. I sent them this message: Many, many thanks for not posting ONLINE that your restaurant would be CLOSED.  So great to arrive and then observe others who also arrived but found it CLOSED.  The sign by the door was of great help AFTER many of us arrived. WOuld have been great to know before hand!"}
{"text":"I stopped since it was close to home. Food and service are good but i have my preferred spots."}
{"text":"Nice spinish saag and chicken tikki here. We always come here for lunch buffet. At 11:30 everything is freshed"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try even though it was a little far from our house and we were glad we did! The food was great and it's not expensive at all! I don't know who would call this restaurant overpriced, it's cheaper than Olive Garden and the food is waaaay better. 

We got Chicken 65 for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. It was a good amount of food for an appetizer and the chicken was really yummy, spicy but with lots of flavor. Then, I got Korma chicken and asked them if they could combine chicken with the vegetarian option (I really wanted veggies in my dinner that night:) and they did, no problem. I thought it was pretty good, could've been a little more flavorful but now I'm just being picky. My husband got Lamb Rogan Josh which he said was really good, the lamb was tender and the whole dish was delicious. We also got an order of cheese stuffed Naan bread which came out hot and very tasty. 

The service was very quick, our waitress was polite and accommodating, no complaints there. We'll definitely be back, even though it's a little bit out of our way, we had great dining experience there!"}
{"text":"Till now the best Indian restaurant we have tried after moving to Arizona. 
We went late at night, just 45 min before the closing time. And were nicely informed about closing time and we may be rushed out. 
We ordered Lassi,  Biryani, Panner Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta and Garlic Naans between 4. Everything tasted awesome and the portions are huge. We had to pack the entire Biryani for home."}
{"text":"Meh...was hit and miss with the food.  We ordered several appetizers and entrees.  The appetizers were done well.  The entrees were a hit, a miss and a foul. The missed entre was mushy and muddled; the flavors just lost in themselves.  The foul dish had a burnt taste about it and was served rather unappetizingly.  We told the waitress so when asked how things were.  Her response was, \"yea, it's not very good which is why I don't eat it\".  We were floored!  Why didn't she suggest something else to us when we ordered?! No offer to replace it for something else or to remove it from the bill either.  _If_ we go back it will be only for the buffet, however we probably won't since there are better Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The Indian place by us closed so we had to go a bit farther afield to try a new spot. This one was definitely worth the drive! We got tikka masala of various heat levels and a korma. All were delicious! Naan was wonderful. The service was friendly without being overbearing. This is my new favorite Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent for the whole family. Chicken Tiki masala, lamb Saag, and Chicken with a buttery sauce (cant remember the name of that one but it was excellent for my 10-yr old daughter who had never had Indian food in her life). 

Mango Martinis to die for. Butter Naan and Garlic Naan. Rice. We splurged on all that for three people. But the best part is the delicious leftovers we get to take home! Yum."}
{"text":"The only vegetarian restaurant which makes you feel home by providing traditional delicious veg dum briyani. In the past one year, we have been there as many as 20 times. For anyone who would like to have original South Indian briyani, I would strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"January 2018

Me: Tastebuds (TB)

TB: yeh?

Me: Are you ready to party ?   

TB: Of course, lets do this!! 

I went for the lunch buffet and it was as promised per the other reviews. Great selection and all very delicious with some great flavors and spice. 

The interior is nice and the restaurant was clean. They had a nice crowd of people enjoying their food. 

Definitely we'll return again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food place in Charlotte.. The weekend lunch buffet is great and the price is affordable.. There are  a variety of dishes comprising both Vegetarian and non vegetarian. Apart from the curries, naan and biryani  you also have chats, SouthIndian Idly , vada and Indo-Chinese.."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Indian spots in the University area. They offer a lunch buffet on the weekend and it is truly something special. Everything is so fresh and they keep the buffet stocked and clean. I usually do take out of the buffet or just an entree and everything is made to order fresh, not to mention some of the best plain and garlic naan around."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian spot....  Small, but clean and all the food is hot and fresh.   Amazing quality and the best Indian lunch buffet I've ever had.  I try to go by here at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"Food was cold/average. Service was okay. The owner himself was nice. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Not anymore. 
The day we moved to Charlotte, we found this restaurant and have been going for 3 years. Rarely do we change what we order and NEVER do we change HOW it's ordered. It's a simple order. And STILL they can't get it right. Keep in mind we used to order sometimes twice a week from this place. 
It's ALWAYS a hit/miss with them. 

When you complain the guy in charge is hiding in the kitchen. When you get the take out incorrectly and find out once you open it at home and call- he's away and will call back. Never get a call back.

So we started going for the predictable buffet. There is NO selection for vegans/vegetarians. The dishes are now all their appetizers. The rest is all meat. 

Strange as i thought indian food boasted a large non meat option. But not here. The prices keep edging up and the service is BELOW average. 

Is it so difficult for you to clear a table before bringing in the main course? 
Is it so difficult for you to cook the dish when it has been sent back to the kitchen twice already?

Simple things but they don't get done. Your staff zig zags all over the place to bring one thing or another but can NOT figure out take things off the table AT THE SAME TIME TOO.  

Between the quality of the food and terrible service we are done with this place. And I won't even go into how my husband was sick the last time we ate there. 

You used to be good. Shame you let the standard drop so much. Not that it was much to begin with."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the mid-week lunch buffet offered at $8.95.  If you like lot's of rice and lots of sauces, you're in luck.  Lentils, potatoes, and three chicken-based dishes that had very little chicken made up the buffet.  I was expecting a greater variety of entrees including lamb, goat, and tandoori.  The chicken biryani was tasty; however, like the other dishes I wondered, \"where's the meat?\"  I don't think I'll book my passage to India anytime soon based on today's buffet."}
{"text":"No Lunch Buffet!  as of 7/30/2015

I'm not sure when they stopped, but it was in the last two weeks.  Now, their lunch is a small menu with small portions of curry, large portions of rice, for the same prices as the buffet.  

No longer a good deal, but still good flavors.  I like their Saag dishes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meal for the most part, but it definitely didn't quell my Indian food cravings. I was left rather confused. 
I got :
Veg samosas, minimal complaints (the tamarind sauce and mint chutney had the consistency of water)
Malai kofta curry -medium spicy. This is what confused me - why on earth was the sauce sweet?? It tasted like they poured a bunch of sugar into it which I've never experienced. - perhaps that's because they also specialize in Indo-Chinese cuisine and that influence has made it's way into their curry? The Chinese in the South is notorious for being way too sweet... please don't let this affect all the Indian restaurants in Charlotte or I will be forced to move back to San Francisco. 
Garlic naan- it was okay
Veg Pualo - this was pretty good, something I never tried before
Gobi Mancurian - I loved the sauce - probably should stick to only ordering it in house though, was pretty soggy by the time it got here."}
{"text":"Passage to India is solid from start to finish. The food is delicious, I've been back a few times now to satisfy the craving for Indian food. I've tried several items off the menu, and they were all pretty tasty. In addition to that, Passage to India definitely doesn't skimp on the protein. Portions are huge, and come with a ton of meat. My biggest pet peeve with a lot of the nearby places is ordering something like Lamb Saag and getting only two or three pieces of lamb. But, you definitely won't have that problem here. The vegetarian dishes I've had are also quite good, and the spices and herbs they put on the various naan they serve are always fresh and fragrant. 

Service is fairly no frills - don't expect much more than drink refills and order taking, but, that's all I'm looking for personally. The waitresses are polite and get the job done. My only real complaint is that they weren't particularly good at fielding questions about the menu and what not when I brought some friends who were less familiar with Indian food than myself. Indian food can definitely be a bit intimidating so I think it's important for staff at these sorts of restaurants to be able to do a good job helping people who haven't had it before. But, that's not too big of a deal. It's not like they were rude, they just weren't super good at explaining what certain dishes were like.

In general, I don't understand the series of negative reviews this restaurant has. I've had better and I've had a lot worse. But, again, this place is solid. I haven't had a single thing here that wasn't delicious. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One again, superb chicken makhani. The butter naan dipped in the makhani sauce and covered with basmati rice us better than Snickers ice cream!"}
{"text":"If I'm in the university area and it's lunch time, the first place that comes to mind is Passage to India. I'm so in love with this place that I invent excuses to make the drive up here. 

Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Indian food and this place does not disappoint. I try to avoid buffets, but this place has an amazing buffet that I just can't resist. The restaurant has a nice quiet atmosphere and is well maintained. The staff is awesome, really polite and attentive.

The food is ridiculous. The curries are flavorful and there is a wide variety. Usually there are 4-5 veggie based curries and 2 chicken based curries. There's nothing quite like mixing delicious chicken tikka masala with jasmine rice and rolling it up in garlic naan. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Not to mention the tandoori chicken that's always on point.

The best part of all, it's affordable. The lunch buffet is only 7-8 dollars! Passage to India is my go to place and if you're a fan of Indian food I suggest you check it out too"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Prices were not. The Tandoori Platter is $16. The portion I got was tiny. I ordered to go. Maybe the portions are larger if you dine in."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why so many people rating this restaurant are rating it on the buffet. I thought everyone knew Indian buffet food (and probably any cuisine prepared for a buffet lunch crowd) pretty much blows. You always want to order it fresh (we usually order from the menu even at lunch). 

I've been eating Indian food for over 20 years and while I know I'm eating a very select and Americanized version of what is really an extremely broad cuisine, I know the difference between good (American) Indian and so-so or bad Indian (I also happen to be a chef). Passage to India is definitely some of the better Indian food I've had in the valley. 

Unlike the experiences I've read here, the food has been extremely consistent in quality, flavor and heat (a problem I've encountered with a lot of Indian restaurants). The rice has NEVER been dry, the food has never been overly salted and the wait staff has been very nice and attentive. 

Many people familiar with Indian food eat some kind of chicken dish, but I was introduced to it when I was a vegetarian and I still order almost exclusively vegetarian dishes when eating at an Indian restaurant. And I would recommend to those who are trying this restaurant (or any Indian restaurant) to go first for the non-meat dishes to get a sense of the depth of flavors when chicken isn't the core flavor. 

We have found Passage to India to be almost always so devoid of people that we have joked that maybe it's a front for something else, that they can't be making any money selling that little food. They also don't have a more traditional d√©cor (in my experience--what do I know about real traditional d√©cor?) that, say, a place like Delhi Palace has. And, finally, not every note is hit perfectly every time; but overall they are very consistent, probably  more consistent than most restaurants I've been to. For those reasons I reduce the stars to 4 instead of 5, but otherwise, enjoy--it's a nice little treasure for Tempe."}
{"text":"Passage to India is a fairly new Indian restaurant in the University area.  Unfortunately, Udipi (the vegetarian restaurant) has closed down and Passage to India took its place.  It features a full menu as well as a weekday lunch buffet and a weekend brunch buffet that serves a couple more items than the regular weekday buffet like specialties from South India and a selection of popular street foods and of course vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian fare.

My family decided to try their weekend buffet, as a way to sample their style of cooking.  The interior: simple, clean.  Service: polite  Price: $9.95 for weekend and $7 something for weekday, menu prices are varied but they have a $3.99, $4.99 and $6.99 bento box type special everyday.

The buffet is served until 3:30 pm, however they refill the buffet trays for the last time at around 2:30 (when we arrived) so we kinda had to try the leftover and dry-ish food.  I didnt expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was Amazing!  I tried to sample a bite of everything, but that was very hard because everything was so good, I wanted to cram my mouth with it.  Even my mom - who never likes restaurant food, ate everything on her plate and praised it to bout!  The amazing Iron Chef-India praised someone else's food!  WOW must've been good :)

Ok, so I tried 2 of the 4 types of rice dishes, which were very flavorful but not overpowering.  I tried the spinach/paneer dumplings in a creamy sauce, boneless tandoori chicken--they have the bone-in tandoori chicken too but since we were so late coming in, we didnt get any :(  chilli chicken which is something everyone should try cause it was really good.  The star of the buffet table was the Indo-Chinese style noodles.  They were so good, it made me wish I had an extra stomach to I could keep eating it!  When I go back, that and the chili chicken is all Im saving my stomach space for.  I even tried the dosa, idli (rice cakes) with coconut chutney and sambar.  They were all good, in fact really good and I cant wait for our next trip down University City Blvd.  

I took some pictures with my iPhone, so I will be posting those as well, please excuse the poor lighting or angles.  Overall, great brunch/lunch but my only regret is coming in so late, cause we missed out on a true 5 star rating meal."}
{"text":"This is going to be a strange review for me. The short version is: I went on Saturday for the buffet. Everything was good and moderately spicy (i'm not a spicy food person but I found everything to have a tolerable level of spice). Service was good. 2 of us ate for $25! I would return.

   Long version: I was not expecting for Saturday to be strictly a buffet day but I soon realized that was the case because we were sat with no menus (around 1pm) and there were no menus to be seen anywhere. 
   About 3 different members of staff asked us for our drink order within 3 minutes so even though communication amongst them wasn't great, they each saw a table with no drinks and took it upon themselves to ask what we wanted; I appreciate that.
   I would love to tell you the names of what I ate specifically but aside from naan, basmati rice, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala, I honestly have no idea what I ate. I can tell you that it was all delicious. Though it was spicy enough to make my nose run a bit, it wasn't unbearable and didn't require me to drink copious amounts of fluids to put out the fire. 
  This buffet was very busy and people would stand outside to wait for their turn to be seated (the entrance has no room whatsoever for people to wait, as a matter of fact, someone may bump you with the door as you are standing at the entrance to pay). 
   It was nice that the patrons were very diverse. If people of all backgrounds are coming to it, you can bet the food is worth it. 
  Oh, get there early because there isn't a ton of seating so you might have to wait if you show up after 1pm. Also, they close between to 2:30-5:00pm so you'll miss your chance until the evening."}
{"text":"This place is the REAL DEAL! Best vegetable Samosas I've ever had. The dishes are authentic and delicious. The portions are filling and satisfying. The prices are totally reasonable, and the service is fast and friendly. We came for dinner and had the best indian meal we've had in a long time - it's hard to find good quality indian food at a reasonable price like this. Unpretentious atmosphere that's clean and welcoming. Call it a hole in the wall, but the focus is on the food and that's what I love about this place! Will definitely come back for the lunch buffet sometime, the prices for the buffet and take out special look perfect and hopefully the food is as good at lunch as it was at dinner!"}
{"text":"After 3 deliveries, 1 takeaway so far, I can definitely say this place doesn't shy away from using its spices. Good food esp their indo-Chinese. Biryani portions are crazy big! I really liked their Gobi-Manchurian. Very flavorful food. however please reconsider your spice level - their food can be very spicy but again equally delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place ever since it opened - 4 years or so. I LOVE the food, atmosphere, and the staff is the best! Happy, the owner, cares about his product and makes sure all of the customers are well taken care of.  The bar is awesome for HH. Just writing this review makes me hungry. I'll probably stop by tonight!

PS - The BS reports of food poisoning make me angry. Their Food Safety score is always an A. They proudly display their inspection reports right at the front entrance (its also public record). If you can't handle spicy food, just let them know when ordering. They will make sure it is mild."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Very tasty and fresh Indian food. I ordered takeout for Sunday evening dinner but liked the ambience. Place looked clean. I ordered kadai chicken(medium spice), chicken biryani(spicy) and tandoori roti.  Spice levels were accurate. Kadai chicken tasted awesome. There was no food coloring added which was great. Biryani also tasted nice. Rotis were ok. Food was hot and not too greasy. Food was ready when I reached to pickup, in 25 mins as informed on phone while ordering. Overall great experience. I am going back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now; once today and once about a year ago. It seems to be the most affordable or cheaper Indian restaurant in this part of Charlotte and is right across the street from UNCC. I wasn't impressed with the food on either visit and found the food to be rather bland. I think I'll ask for my entree to be spicy instead of \"medium spicy,\" if I return. They do have an impressive number of vegetarian offerings and my sweet lassi was really good."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the Indian buffets, mainly because the food often is bland because it is after all quantity over quality. I was surprised at how good the food was at Passage to India. We tried the weekend buffet for lunch recently. The chaat section is so so. But their main buffet is really good and only $9.99. If you like Goat/lamb biryani, then you will like their goat biryani. Their Indo chinese dishes are also yum. The also have a good variety of south Indian dishes too. Something on the buffet for everyone. It may become mine and hubby's weekend hangout. Its a bit of a long drive for us from South Charlotte, but the food is totally worth it. Definite yum factor!"}
{"text":"Went here for mother's day since my mom had been wanting to try it for awhile. We definitely will have to come back again. The house cabernet was very good and dry. Everyone at our table ordered something different and we just tried a bit of everything.  Every dish was excellent and the waiter was attentive and able to explain what the different dishes were since we don't eat Indian food much. The garlic naan bread was also great.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"3.5.
Food = 4
Service = 3

I'll rate a 4 to give the benefit of the doubt. The Indian food was pretty good. I was satisfied but it isn't the best I've had. 

I'll just lay it out there that I'm totally fine being the closed minded American eating Chicken Tikka Masala, and they did that pretty well with it. Service could have been a little quicker though. 

Also very reasonably priced which helped the rating."}
{"text":"To be honest, this is some terrible Indian food. The only good item I had was water. Rest everything was tasteless, this food is meh, pretty much to say that everything is bland. Even the gulab jamoon in the buffet was super cold. Don't know about dinner but, buffet is a no go for me, at least it was cheap."}
{"text":"Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and delivery here several times and the food is delicious and very consistent! Today I decided to try the lunch buffet and it was just as good as the takeout!

The restaurant itself is pretty small and decor is minimal but the place is clean. Maybe a bit tight when busy but it was at about 3/4 capacity during lunch today. A bit of confusion when we got there, our drink orders were taken and we did indeed want the buffet but our server didn't really tell us anything regarding the buffet. We finally took a cue from the other tables and made our way to the buffet ourselves.

The slight disappointment that there was no Chicken Tikka Masala was quickly forgotten about with the plentiful options on the buffet today. I feel silly for not remembering what it was called, but all the way on the far left of the buffet in front of the curried chicken, was chicken with a similar masala sauce but arguably better chicken! Went back for some of that three times! Basmati rice was perfectly cooked, fragrant, slightly nutty, outstanding.

Our server didn't say much at all but kept the drinks full and cleared out plated frequently. For the price I can't argue at all!

What was once just a take-out joint for me is now a solid dine-in option. What a great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I'm continually pleased by the level of customer care I receive during my visits. The food is always good & fresh. I find it overly refreshing that the men always take the opportunity to open the door for the women. I know it may sound cheesy, but it's just a really nice touch. The food is spicy to please most tastebuds, but not gimme a beer to kill the heat spicy. I'm always left with the best food coma feeling."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet and was not disappointed. 

Passage -- specializing in North and South Indian cuisine -- offers one of the more extensive menus I have seen as an Indian restaurant. 

But, please, that isn't saying much considering my home base is in Tucson where we are fairly short on very good Indian food. 

Menu items include kati, pakora, mirchi; soups like sambar and mulligatawny; dosa -- yay!; various types of biryani, including goat; korma, curry, saag (one of my favorites), vindaloo; and even Chinese options -- what, what? Yes, there's fried rice and Schezuan noodles on the menu. Random. 

Lots of naan, too: plain, garlic, paneer, onion, keema and others. 

I especially enjoyed the saag, tikka masala and the aloo gobhi. A few dishes may be lacking in spice and heat, but I am guessing that's because the buffet is trying to cater to an expansive range of tastes. No problem. I get it. 

I like the layout of the place. It is very casual during the afternoon, but has the feeling of being able to dress of very nicely for the evening.

Takes reservations by phone and online."}
{"text":"Authentic n Tasty. Easy to locate n a very spacious place with real good  maintainance."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant in the area.  Unlike most Indian restaurants which have family doing the cooking, these guys have chefs.  They have a large menu, with items not found on other Indian menus.  

We ordered the Kati rolls, Lamb Saag, and Kerala duck curry, they were all delicious.  The staff (with the exception of the hostess) were friendly and informative.  

We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This review is for the buffet only.  Their advertising coupon brought us in to the buffet.  I must also mention that I frequent Indian buffets and enjoy Indian food.  The buffet was not bad, but it wasn't good either.  Usually I go for Indian because of the bold flavors, and there just wasn't any flavor to this buffet.  It wasn't memorable.  The selection of items was just okay.  Not impressed.  I certainly won't be returning for the buffet and most likely not for dinner.  We did have good service, however."}
{"text":"Wonderful buffet with lots of choices, vegetarian and meat both. Buffet comes with choice of nan, I had garlic and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Being an Indian, It's not difficult for me to distinguish good and bad India food. This place is by far the best  Indian restaurant in the entire valley, yes, i have eaten at several Indian restaurant and can easily say this.
It's very conveniently located in Tempe.   The bar is awesome with wide selection of drinks. The servers and excellent and the owner \"Happy\" is the best. I have been coming here for 3 years now and the taste has always been consistent. My favorite is Chicken chettinad and Paneer Tikka Masala. That doesnt mean other dishes are not excellent. 

I am so glad we finally an Indian restaurant where I can go anytime and take my friends and family and not worry about food quality. I wish i could give 10 stars."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that my first visit here was spectacular, so this is really disappointing to have to write.

We came in for a late-ish dinner, 815 on 12/21 (Thursday) and had the place to ourselves... Which should have been a sign, but after a long work-day I was happy for the quiet atmosphere.

We were greeted, seated, and provided with water and papadum, which we happily began to snack on... and then we saw it.  Among the little black spots on the papadum (the customary ingredients) one of them was moving... a tiny little black bug, maybe the size of a seed bead, crawling across the surface of the remaining cracker in the basket.

We called the server over to show her.  She looked at it with a horrified expression, but made zero move to bring it to the attention of management.  We got up and walked out.

Folks, running a restaurant isn't rocket science - the rules can be broken down into 2 main tenets - a) serve quality product and b) don't have bugs.

We went to Delhi Palace near the university and had a fine meal, and will not be returning to Passage of India.

You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service and great food. The aroma of spices cooking as you enter is alluring. The portions are big and the food is fresh and delicious. The buffet is ok, but I highly recommend ordering from the menu. Veggie korma, saag paneer, and the gobi manchurian are my favs. The naan is good too. Served family style, 2 dishes could easily feed 4 people. The price is right for the quality of food. Take the passage to India and put it in your mouth."}
{"text":"A soild lunch buffet for ~11. However I would not mind it being a dolar less due to few veg options.

The flavors were vibrant in the saag and pakora, The soup was a bit too salty but still good, However they only had foam cups for the soup. Desert was just kheer and gulab.  Garlic naan is included which is nice.  The rice was just plain basmati rice and it was a bit under cooked. The chai tea is also included.

One nice thing was in the condiments section there was Indian hot sauce. 

Overall another decent addition to the Indian food landscape of the area, but nothing too special, at least for their buffet."}
{"text":"It's usually hit or miss when we go to Indian buffets. I'm not one to partake in spicy food, so I'm especially picky when it comes to the entrees they have on the buffet. Most Indian buffets have butter chicken on the menu, or some mild chicken curry dish most would like. A Passage India did not have my favorite dish, but they had chicken dish called Chicken makhani. Superb! The Naan was soft and delicious. Even the rice dessert was the best I have ever had. 

The only thing I don't like is the fact there is no parking during the week at lunch. If you do find parking, the spots are too narrow. Don't bring your most expensive car. Your doors will get hit. 

You will love this place if you love Indian food!"}
{"text":"Ordered here this afternoon (Delivery) was definitely quality food nice balance of spices unlike some Indian restaurant I have ordered from in the past where they feed to the misconception of indian food being purposely blazing hot.  Very professional attendants and food arrived precisely on time (50 mins).  I had ordered a plate of Lamb Biryani, Goat Vindaloo and some Butter Naan.  The only disappointment was that the food was a bit cold by the time it arrived, however it is a bit chilly outside today.  It would have been nice if the restaurant took measures to ensure the food remained hot by the time it reached.  All in all cant complain, I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I've been to Passage to India a few times at this point, and I have to say that I've been amazed by how consistent the quality of their food is.

Consistent in the fact that it's terrible, that is.

Passage to India is a pretty standard Indian buffet, largely in the fact that it's awful, but different tasting enough from most 'American' fare that most of this venue's patrons are going to be none the wiser. 

The food served in the buffet is often bland, stale, and the ingredients are generally third-rate. The service is about as bad as the food, and every waiter I've encountered at this place is either unhelpful or unfriendly. In short, this place is to Indian food what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Take your $12 elsewhere and you'll probably be guaranteed a superior culinary experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and the service is wonderful. I am a vegan and they have a great menu selection."}
{"text":"Restaurant was  not busy. Service was great. Server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Lamb and chicken entr√©es were very good. The lamb entr√©e was our favorite. Chicken entr√©e was good but different than we have had at other restaurants. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently great food recently. In the past, it was a bit hit or miss but not anymore. Usually very quiet. I can never understand why it's not more crowded."}
{"text":"When the delivery guy showed up, I paid with 3 $20 bills and asked for $2 in change. He started being rude. He said \"your bill was 58 dollars, but that's fine!\" He was being rude and sarcastic. That $58 included a $9 tip... Screw that guy. What a twat.

The food had good flavor but it was really hot... Unless you want REALLY REALLY HOT, don't order! Even my boyfriend said his mouth was on fire. I just spent $58 on food that I can't eat :( I ordered a pizza. 

Attached is my receipt... Proof that I tipped. Not sure why he was such a jerk. Will NEVER order again."}
{"text":"Take it from a south asian -- Passage to India is amazing. There are definitely some other south asian restaurants out there that beat this place in terms of taste but for the price and portion size, this wins. The staff are always super friendly and portion sizes are huge. They also delivery if you order enough and are close enough. def check them out!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great Indian lunch buffet equal to the ones that Silicon Valley engineers frequent in my old stomping grounds."}
{"text":"My previous roommate took me to Passage to India almost two years ago and I was exceptionally impressed with the quality of food. Who cares about decor when you're getting the best Indian cuisine in the area? Much like that favorite diner in a small town or that hole in the wall in a city, it's a gem. If you go to a place like that and it's almost always packed and not a chain restaurant, you know it has to be good. 
I didn't make it back too often, but I found a menu I grabbed the first time I was there in my delivery box today. They deliver within a 5 mile radius and I count myself exceptionally lucky that I live within it.
 I ordered the Eelam Calamari ( I LOVE calamari) and it was actually better than my favorite Greek style. Also, I ordered the assorted bread basket  with enough variety and naan to last me a week. The Hydrabadi Keema (Minced lamb cooked in an authentic mogul style with fresh spices) was outstanding. 
I've never ordered delivery service from them, but it was perfect. 25 minutes for steaming hot, perfectly prepared food that in NO way disappoints. You can also order online. I have no idea why I didn't know they delivered sooner! I was always disappointed in my delivery options in the University area, until now. No more settling for Domino's or Wing Zone when I'm too tired to cook.
Between that and the International Market nearby, I can safely say I no longer have to eat crappy, unhealthy, tasteless food when I'm desperate and exhausted, but hungry. Passage to India is amazing. 
Also, if you're not afraid of (or thoroughly enjoy, like me) spicy food, get the Hydrabadi Keema spicy. Perfection."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok.
Stopped in for the lunch buffet, after discovering the nearby Indian places were closed on Mondays.
I enjoyed the food, and thought it was pretty average.  Nothing spectacular, but the service was top-notch!
The cold wet donut dessert was above average tho."}
{"text":"I hate giving out 5 stars, but this place deserves it.  I recently took my family here and we all enjoyed our food immensely.  I got the dinner special.  For under 20 bucks it comes with a soft drink,  choice of appetizer, choice of curry Biryani and choice of dessert.  Can't beat that.  The vegetable samosa's were on point.  Best I've had.  The Biryani was also tasty.  I got the fried cheese balls for dessert.  They were done well also.  This place is popular.  On a Sunday night there were several parties of 10+ people.  The service staff did an OK job pacing the meal, though it took longer to get our bill then I would have liked.  The only negative, my family (not me) got the special Indian spiced tea.  It came with milk.  Not advertised but OK.  It came with loose tea leaves in it,  OK.  Not a huge big deal,  BUT the milk used had been scalded and caused a funky film on the cup and it just didn't taste right per my family.  Oh well, I'm rounding up...4.5 stars....  I'll be back.  They are a little too far for takeout, but I'll definitely keep them in mind when I want a good Indian restaurant north of the city."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant we've tried since moving to the Valley. We've only been there for the buffet, but the quality was great, and they had dishes, such as goat curry, that I've never seen at other Indian buffets. They also have some of the best kheer I've ever had. Great mango chutney, too, which I know is a small thing, but it was a nice touch."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  Lunch buffets normally offer chicken tikka masala, a saag dish, a couple vegetable dishes, and a curry chicken.  Every now and then there is goat available and it is great! The meals are reasonably priced and  the portion sizes at dinner are generous.  The staff here is lovely and very welcoming."}
{"text":"I had the chicken curry to go and it was delicious. I should have gotten medium spice, mild was too Busch league for me. The rice was cooked well, and the chicken was delicious as well. The restaurant was cozy and clean, a little dim but nice for the location it is in. The staff was also attentive and knowledgeable as well."}
{"text":"First time! Extra spicy!
REVIEW: PASSAGE TO INDIA--A nice place-- Good service...
Although MY 1st time with food from India, my son had previous experience with this spicy Indian cuisine...So he knew what he liked...We also asked our server for some guidance.We tried a few dishes...: We split everything...1st, a vegetable \"fritter\" type appetizer with some spicy chutney; Then, spicy lentil soup I broke up my fritter into the soup---- yummie. Then we tried 3 very different-from-each-other \"main dishes\": Lamb Tikka Masala: A kind of meat stew with a red curry very robust gravy Very good and very rich....Chili Vegetables, A sort of \"vegetable hash\" of potatoes, carrots, peas, onions, bell peppers,cauliflower in a spicy sauce; and Palak Paneer, a spinach/ cheese dish which was very good. The flavors were wonderful and each dish had a different spice/flavor palate. We ordered it extra spicy-- and our waiter and waitress advised against it. We convinced them we could handle it. So they were VERY surprised when we asked for more of the spicy sauce to kick the heat up a couple of notches. We topped it off with a sweet \"smoothie\" type mango yogurt drink Kulfie, and a cup of Indian Chai tea.
Plenty of left-overs for take home and we spent about $50 plus tip.
I understand that lunchtime, they have a huge selection, served buffet style, and it would allow for an economical way to try more of these very savory dishes.I would do this again!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Indian Restaurant in Charlotte.  I've been going here for the 10 years that I've lived in NC, and I drive all the way from Monroe to eat here it is so great.  If I lived closer I'd eat here a couple times a week.  Never a disappointment. And I like that sometimes I find new dishes to try.  It's the best by far."}
{"text":"First off the food and overall experience here was amazing.  I called in a reservation for 14-18 people and when we arrived they had everything set up very nicely and seated us immediately.  We had a side room all to ourselves and a dedicated waitress. 

We ordered drinks and a couple appetizers.  Then they sent out two complimentary appetisers, the Gobi Manchurian and the Chilly Chicken.  The Chilly Chicken was excellent but the Gobi Manchurian surprised everyone.  It was amazing.  We all kept asking how cauliflower could be this good.  Seriously. Order this.

Then our main courses came.  Everything came as ordered.  There were few orders of Chicken Tikka Masala which everyone said was very very good.  Also the spiciness levels were perfect.  My wife wanted the heat to make her cry a bit and it did.  The medium had kick but didn't make anyone suffer.  Mild was just awesome tasting.  

I ordered the Chicken Dum Biryani but I wish I had trusted my gut an ordered the goat.  Not because the chicken was bad.  It was delicious and reminded me of the meals my friends from India cook for us.  It was just that one of my friends ordered the Goat Vindaloo and raved about it.

My experience was echoed by the other 13 people in our party.  We all had a wonderful time and it could not have gone better.  We will all be returning again and bringing as many new faces as possible to this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered deliver tonight and I was less than pleased. Even when I specified I didn't want my tikka masala to be spicy, it was. I ordered a portion of nan bread and it seriously had two small pieces, the appetizers were cold and my order took a little over an house even though I live 5 minutes away. I don't think I'm going to be ordering dinner from this place again, but I might still go for the lunch buffet once in a while because the lunch buffet even if not the best Indian food I've had is not the worst one either. For $8 or so I liked their chicken tikka masala ( not as spicy as the one I got deliver), love the onion bhaji I just wish they had fresh from the oven naan bread like other Indian buffet's I've had. Not a fan of their mango lassi, they have a different version with some herbs, I like the sweet one."}
{"text":"Super duper yummy!!! The place is a little rough around the edges, but it is Indian food. Very friendly staff and the food was top notch. Great job!! Don't judge the book by the cover when you pull up.. Take the chance and go in. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This place definitely hit the spot for me and a fellow yelper (Grace check her page out!)

We came here for the lunch Buffet which was reasonably priced. ($10 for all you can eat) They had a very nice assortment of Indian food and they all tasted pretty good. And I was told from a friend of mine that it is quite authentic as well. 

The butter chicken was pretty good and after two plates I was full. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and how they catered to giving you the sense of an Indian culture.

But I definitely enjoyed the food and will recommend people to come here to eat their buffet and get a taste of that butter chicken. (and all their other delicious food!)"}
{"text":"As I said from my last review, this is our favorite Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. We finally decided to go and try the lunch buffet. 
We were delighted to find many of our favorites were also offered in the buffet, along with may things we have never tried. 
Positive- we liked many of the dishes we have never tried before, we now have many new favorites when we go back
Negative- our tried and true favorites that we normally ordered were much much better when we got them fresh as individual entrees vs. on the buffet line. I am glad that we have eaten here many times before with regular entrees!
The buffet included a couple of soups and salad bar along with a basket of naan delivered to the table. White rice along with a couple types of biryani rice were included in the buffet. Highlights included the goat curry, chicken tikka masala, matar paneer (cheese and peas in a creamy sauce), saag spinach,  and the mirchi ka salan (green peppers, tomatoes and onions with sauce).
We enjoyed the old favorites and are excited to have a few new favorites to order now!"}
{"text":"I love Indian and am in the search of trying to find a good one in Charlotte. I've been here a couple of times and out of the three I've been to so far this is the best. 

Now if your looking for ambience this is not for you, go to The Blue Taj in Ballantyne. The interior reminds me of a Chinese take out place, not much to look at. But the food is tasty. I haven't tried their lunch buffet but have been to dinner here. I like that you can change up the spice level, although when I ordered a level 5 of 5 I was dissapointed by the lack of heat. But the food is flavorful. The have onion bhajis which I love, and also onion chutney....mmmm I love it on some nice warm naan bread. 

So if you're looking for flavor, and not for romantic decor choose this place."}
{"text":"we decided to try Passage to India out during dinner time, which it's not very busy at all. When you first walk in the place, the curry smell hit your nasal right away. 

I order a mango lassi  which taste more like a dessert.  We got Samosa for appetizer, and  shrimp biryani, curry chicken, garlic naan and plain dosa for entree. Then the cheese ball and rice pudding for dessert.

Overall, the food is ok not very impressed. I do love the garlic naan, which is crispy outside and soft inside. The price is a bit expensive for the amount of food. I probably wouldn't go back here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here several times from Postmate's and we have never been disappointed. To far for us to travel in traffic, but worth as a takeout

We have had the lamb vindaloo, paneer tikka malasa, and chilly paneer. All excellent and fresh as if we were at the restaurant. 

Highly recommend to anyone. Makes me want to order it right now, later Yelp off to Postmates lol."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy Indian. Good rice pudding. We went during resto week aka queen's feast. Really good deal. Still looking for Indian food in clt that will knock my socks off tho."}
{"text":"Passage to India - Vindaloo Heavan!

This is the Best Place in Phoenix for Vindaloo Period!  I have many Indian restaurants that I really enjoy, but Passage to India is my absolute favorite.  Whether you like Lamb, Chicken or Veggie Vindaloo, you can not go wrong.  Don't get me wrong, the vindaloo is the best in the valley, but I have not had a dish here that wasn't excellent!  They don't use fillers in their dishes (typically potatoes) which many Americanized Indian restaurants do these days.  Happy, the owner, only uses family recipes and they are amazing to say the least.

Go in and say hi to Happy and help support our local Mom 'N' Pop restaurants!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the restaurant. It was recommended to us by friends. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and we will definitely return. We have been to several Indian eateries in the east valley and this one is the best by far!!! The lamb is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet.

Not very impressed.  The goat curry and the chicken curry had bones!  Yes, bones!   Selection was pretty limited.  And no delicious creamy Korma!  Nothing!!  The food was pretty bland.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Passage to India, you are missing out! This was only the second time I had tried Indian food. The first was at a buffet, and while I liked the flavors, nothing really stood out to me. Tonight I got a taste of what really good Indian food is. Started with the Kati Roll with chicken at the suggestion of our nice server. They were flavorful and the sauce for them was terrific. I had the chicken tikka masala and hubby tried the chicken curry. Both were so good I would have licked the bowl had there not been other customers around us.Also had garlic naan and gulab jamun for desert. There was a seperate bar area and happy hour prices looked great. $2 beers, $4 Absolut drinks. Everything was so delicious I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As an absolute novice to Indian cuisine, I had always been a little hesitant to try it out because I wasn't sure I would be able to stomach the spices. Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavors and the dishes I ordered at Passage to India.

I tried this place thanks to a suggestion of my best friend who works nearby and asked me to join her for a Friday evening dinner. Passage to India is situated in a tiny strip mall right down the street from UNCC (aka my alma mater, go 49ers!) and is quite small inside so the place can fill up quite quickly. I joined my friend around 6:30 p.m. and walked right in with no wait.

For my beverage, I ordered the mango juice which was pure, delicious mango puree and the vegetable samosas as an appetizer. The samosas were brought out nice and hot and served with two different dipping sauces. One was green which had more of a cilantro flavor and the other was brown which was on the sweeter side. Forgive me, as I have no idea of the \"official\" names for the sauces.

I didn't have the chance to look over their menu online before I visited so I relied on the knowledge and preferences of my friend to walk me through the menu possibilities. I would personally recommend checking out the online menu before you go because it can be a bit overwhelming especially if you're an Indian food newbie. I settled on the chicken tikka masala which is grilled chicken breast cooked with tomato creamy sauce and served with basmati rice. My friend ordered the tandoori chicken. I have to rave here: THEY WERE BOTH DELICIOUS. My taste buds were so relieved!

Our waiters varied throughout our meal but all were so kind and accommodating and checked in to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. As a newly-minted Indian food fan, I am happy to have a place to recommend and cannot wait to come back to try their highly talked about lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner this visit.

Tikka Masala, Korma, & Andhra Curry - all chicken.
Butter, Garlic, & Paneer Naan.
Chicken 65 appetizer.
Everything was served with white rice. 

The Naan was all very good. Soft with just a hint of toastiness, not too dry.

The Chicken 65 was unremarkable. Lightly spicy with lots of onion and cilantro.

The Chicken Korma was ordered extra mild for the non spice eater in the group and come out spot on. Very flavorful without any heat. The chicken itself was bonless, tender and absorbed the flavors well.

The Chicken Andhra Curry was ordered medium but came out a little over spicy and astringent. The aroma hinted of flavorful spices but was overwhelmed by the heat of the dish. Surprisingly the chicken was served bone-in! The chicken was swimming in sauce which made it not finger food and made enjoying it more of a task. 

The Chicken Tikka Masala was spot on for both flavor and spiciness. The let down was the chicken itself, dense cubes of chicken breast. The chicken was dry and absorbed none of the wonderful flavor in the sauce. 

Nothing was really bad, just not fantastic. Worth another visit.
Maybe for their lunch buffet, too."}
{"text":"Good buffet. Perfect location. Nice food. But the restaurant is small and its difficult to stand around the buffet counter. Nice chaat and desserts!!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for over a year. It has taken us this long to finally decide not to return. They have been going through staff like water, and each waiter is ruder than the last. Our last meal, June 19, ruined my birthday. We ordered peas and mushrooms, and got only mushrooms. The took it back, and when they dropped it back off, the pease were ice cold. The third attempt, the mushrooms were burnt."}
{"text":"Amazing! I prefer to take out the lunch box on weekdays, it's a better value for me since the buffet is a little limited. I LOVE the weekend buffet though, so much food and variety. 

If you eat dinner here, try the bhindi masala. It's kinda an okra stew, which I would have thought sounded gross, but it's so good! My other favorite is the chicken tikka masala. 

For dessert try the rice kheer- sweetened rice in coconut milk, or galub jamon- fried cheese balls that don't taste very cheesy, soaked in a sweet syrup."}
{"text":"While this is my absolute favorite Indian food in the whole charlotte area. They did take away there lunch buffet and substitute it with a small lunch option now. I enjoyed the buffet because I like to have a little bit of everything. We do have them deliver to our house or eat dinner there weekly. And will continue to support them. Hopefully they bring the buffet back soon. Or on the lunch menu offer more than the two options. If I could mix and match that would be better."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in India (Indian from India i know Indian food), so trust me when I give it 1 star. 
Of course, I was exited to try this place as I just moved to the valley of the sun from San Francisco. I was highly disappointed with everything we ordered : Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Chilly, Garlic naan and Daal (you cannot mess-up Daal, its like messing up Mac and Cheese).
Both chicken dishes tasted exactly the same (which is not correct). Naan was cold (another red flag). Finally the Daal I know most of you don`t order this dish in Indian restaurants as I mentioned it will be like ordering Mac and cheese in an American restaurant. I always try Daal at a new Indian restaurant as this gives me a good idea of how good the food is. It`s a simple vegetarian dish made with Lentils. There are many interpretetion for this dish so very restaurant will have a different take on it.
I really wanted this restaurant to be good after all the reviews, but it will be a challenge for me to try this place again."}
{"text":"I love this humble Indian restaurant! The service is excellent and their Tikka Masala (Paneer Makhani) is delicious. The waitstaff is amazing. They are very attentive and always remember what my husband and I order. My husband loves their lamb biryani. For us we have tried competitors and are always disappointed we didn't come to Passage to Indian. 

One request - please get a liquor license. 

However it speaks a lot to have such a popping place that doesn't serve booze. That means the food speaks for itself, right? They also do take out. Yum!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate there over a month ago. Right when we got inside, it felt awakard as if we were unwelcome and waited to be seated. Of course it was our first time there so we didn't really know much of how the procedure and process of the restaurant works. Apparently, we went in the afternoon because they were still serving their lunch buffet yet we wanted to order from the menu since I've checked few reviews about it. It took them a few minutes longer than average restaurant to give us the menu and take our order, including bringing our drinks. So let's cut to the chase, I couldn't order what I wanted because it was lunch time and that was the whole purpose going there; therefore, my girlfriend and I shared her entree and appetizer. Overall, the food was pretty good and different. The water had little ice and by the time it was refilled, all the ice had melted away already (like really, no kidding). Service wasn't the worse but had an unwelcoming environment. I'll give it another try (next year)."}
{"text":"I am very confused on how this place has such a high rating.  The Goat curry I ordered for pick up may or may have not have actually had goat in it.  The actually curry tasted all right.  However, the \"meat\" was nothing but bones, fats, and tendons.  I am not the type of person to who would freak out over finding one bone in my dish, it happens.  The problem comes when I ordered goat curry and there was actually only on small bite of meat in the dish with the rest being bones and random other bits.  If they where running low on actual goat meat and had to make due they could have given me a call and I could have ordered something else."}
{"text":"Our regular go to Indian place is currently under renovation, so after trying a myriad of places, we finally stumbled upon this gem for lunch buffet. When walking in the first thing to hit you is the delicious smells of Indian cuisine. Our waiter seated us quickly and asked right away what we'd like to drink and what type of naan we'd like. The decor is tasteful and clean, the buffet quite extensive. All our favorites were offered including some items we hadn't seen before. Our go to is always the chicken tikka masala and it didn't disappoint. The sauce was thick and creamy, not watered down like most places offer for lunch, and they used white chicken meat versus fatty sub-par dark meat. Their buffet is only $10.99 so well worth the delicious flavors. Definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Passage To India for a few years.  The buffet lunch is the boss!  Always good selections of vegetarian food and chicken dishes for carnivores.  Their vegetarian box lunches are $5 and will fill you up.  It includes basmati rice, two selections and naan!   Located near the University - all academic types eat there.  The restaurant decor is plain, but the food is satisfying.  If you like flavor - go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, decent service.  The lunch buffet only cost $11.99 on the weekend and is well worth the money. The vegetable samosa was not great and wan overcooked (burnt) so I did not enjoy that. There were 6 servers working but I had to ask for my beverage to be refilled and the plates that needed to be removed from the table kept piling up. The food, the buffet, is worth the trip, but don't expect great service."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was poor. Since there was a lunch buffet, they assumed we didn't want menus or any type of service. We sat waiting until we saw someone to flag down."}
{"text":"We chose to have lunch here (buffet) today based on the number of good reviews. Sadly, we were totally underwhelmed by the food, ambience and lacklustre service. 

If you've been to even one decent Indian buffet, Passage to India WILL probably disappoint you. 

The food was bland, the pakoras were blah, and the biryani - which I think was actually pilau rice - was oily and tasted sweet. 

We will not be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, excellent service. This is a great family place or nice for a quiet date night."}
{"text":"We used to drive 30 minutes away to get Indian food until we discovered Passage To India right down the street from us. Now we like this place better and it's closer too! We get the garlic naan, chicken tikka and tikka marsala all delicious! Friendly service too."}
{"text":"The worst Indian joint i have been to in AZ. Dont get me wrong, the place is decked up with nice tables, chairs, and lighting. Only problem is that without good food or good service none of that matters. Went there on a Friday night aroung 7PM, waiter took about 15 mins to come over, food took more than 30 mins after ordering and when it did come out it was cold! I ordered the goat biryani, and for those of you who know what this is will understand why i was pissed that they brought out steamed basmati rice with goat curry under the rice (2 piece of meat that were 80% bone). Told them good luck and took off. Dont waste your time or money on this place, food and managment are well below par!"}
{"text":"There is no question, this is our favorite Indian buffet in Charlotte. The food is amazing and always very fresh. There are many options for vegetarians and non-veg (me). I don't know what it is about the University area and great Indian food, but this is definitely the best around. The malai kofta is always my favorite. Chicken tikka masala, paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh naan, and there's always something new to try. Fresh gulab jamun too for dessert which is delicious. We usually go to the lunch buffett on Saturday which is always slamming. It can be very crowded at times, just be patient, everyone is very friendly and just wants to get down with some good food, especially hungry college students!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Indian lunch buffet in University City area of Charlotte, NC. Reasonably priced and friendly service. The decor is family/friendly/cozy. You can't eat here for less than $10 and eat well. They may even offer student discounts. My favorite dishes here are Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Makhani."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was so good and reasonably priced!  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have been living in the neighborhood for 2 years and when to the restaurant like 100 times. I like almost all the food items. Good thing is they give cheap lunch boxes."}
{"text":"Coworker and I had wanted to try Passage to India since we heard they opened, so off we went at high noon on a Thursday.  They had a nice lil lunch crowd and we were there to try out the lunch buffet, it had a nice amount of items to pick from  but I was sold on the chicken tikka masala & vegetable biryani,  I cannot even tell you how much I had been cravin tikka masala and with the garlic naan bread, it was the perfect dish! 

For a new place the service was lil slow, but I just counted that as being new and am ready to try them for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"Their Makhani Chicken with Garlic Naan bread is the very best. We order it at least twice a month. Everyone we've ever talked to there is extremely polite and extremely helpful. The fact that they deliver is always a plus. This meal has become a family staple."}
{"text":"I came here for their lunch buffet and their food was delicious!  I wish I lived closer so I can frequent this place more.  Their Shai Paneer was probably my favorite, but their other veggie dishes were good too.  The naan was a little too thin for my taste but they were still good with the food.  Their rice is really good too."}
{"text":"Always been my first choice when it comes to Indian food. I'm an Indian and have been to many Indian restaurants around Charlotte. So far nothing beats the consistent quality of their food. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible atmosphere. No music. Ultra quiet and awkward. No kids pricing so a 5 year old costs the same as an adult meal. Not family friendly. Ridiculous. Skip it."}
{"text":"Happened to land up at this place on the weekend of Helena storm. Most other places were closed at noon affected by the storm. This place was fine and running - a saviour for us. A lot of variety for a lunch buffet. They had 4 curries, Biryani, Rice, Naan, 3 appetisers, Pav Bhaji, Idli, Vada, Chaatand Kheer. That's a lot of dishes. The naam wasn't too good. Neither was the Malai Kofta (koftas were very stiff). Chaat chutney was not good again. Would recommend them having bigger plates. They had smaller than normal plates which can become quite a task in buffets."}
{"text":"The Shahi paneer is like crack, and I just can't get enough  pretty sure everyone at passage recognizes me and my boyfriend. We get it every weekend, and the take out lunch option is an amazing price. I get a vegetarian lunch box for $5 and it feeds me for two meals!

Very friendly staff! Two thumbs up for food and service."}
{"text":"I loved the buffet here! The food was good and full of flavor. I can't recall the names of anything I ate and I didn't eat the chicken dishes. They looked good but today was a meatless day. 

I really enjoyed the onions (I think they were fried?). The bread was fresh and definitely worth a try. The staff was friendly and courteous. Just as important, the food wasn't stale! That's usually an issue at buffets. I will be coming here again and will definitely pass the word to my friends, too."}
{"text":"I really love Indian food so much! The hubby and I decided to go out for a bit. We chose this place because it had really good reviews, however I do not believe our experience reflects the service is on a regular basis"}
{"text":"My boss, who is originally from India, and I found this restaurant during a recent business trip.  After our first visit we felt the food was ok, like \"I had it before\".  We decided to give the restaurant another shot on a second trip two months later.  The second time, everything was delicious, more than we expected.  We ordered Palak Paneer (Cheese in Spinach Gravy), Dal Fry (Cooked Lentil), Bhindi Masala (Okra cooked in spices) and Spicy Cheese Masal Dosa.  The Dosa was unbelievable, crispy-juicy-hearty-delicious. And Chili Naan, if you like spicy, this is something you don't want to miss.  We regretted so much not being able to finish all of the dishes but I had to fly back to California the next morning and could not take the leftover's back to the hotel.  The waiter (seemed to be an owner?) actually remembered us from our previous visit.  He specifically remembered my boss's preference for certain foods, this impressed us even more.  I am looking forward to eating at Passage To India when I get back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had in Charlotte.  Consistently good.  They delivery too."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and the 1st thing we did was search for Indian restaurants. We found this one and gave it a shot. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the amazing smells of food that wafted from the kitchen.  Our waitress was friendly and the service was great.  If you like your Indian to have a bite, order it a little hotter than you would normally (at least for myself) as the spicing (while fantastically flavorful and rich) tend to run on the mild side.
Definitely worth while."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch buffet if you are unsure what you want or trying Indian cuisine for the first time. The garlic naan I recommend and the chicken tikka masala is very good w the basmati rice. Everything we have ordered is tasty."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend this evening and was pleasantly surprised by the food and relaxing atmosphere. My friend and I shared the chicken tiki marsala, chicken saag, and garlic naan. The chicken marsala and saag we had mild flavored and it was still very well seasoned and delicious. The garlic naan was light and soft and went great with the two chicken dishes. They give you a lot of food, so be prepared to share and to take some home. My friend and I definitely plan on going back as they have a lunch buffet and the waiting staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Namaste.

I took a coworker here for lunch. Now you've got to imagine, my coworker and friend, was the living embodiment of Aunt B. from the Andy Griffith show. My mischievous nature thought that it might be interesting to introduce her to something outside of her comfort zone. 

Passage to India is a neat way to be introduced to Indian cuisine, since lunchtime features a buffet. One gets to try a little of everything. I have to admit, that I didn't know what I was eating the majority of the time - but it was flavorful, and spicy. I was smart enough to get plenty of the yogurt dish, that I characterize as an \"Indian fire extinguisher.\"

Service was very good. The buffet was kept fresh, and the employees were friendly. Prices were reasonable. 

When I asked \"Aunt B.\" if she enjoyed lunch she said, \"yes.\" When I asked her later on if she wanted to return she said, \"uh uh,\" - translation: no. The spiciness was just a little more than she bargained for. ;o)

PS: Parking here is pretty much like trying to squeeze into a sardine can, so arrive early or park down at the left side of the building and walk up. There is more parking on the left, next to Arby's, and less chance of door dings. Also be careful of \"idjits\" driving around the blind narrow corner too fast - it happens."}
{"text":"The Passage to India lunch buffet never fails to satiate my curry and tandoori fix and their mixed up lunch buffet has kept me happily coming back here for about 2 years.

No one is going to say this is the best Indian food that you'll ever eat, but, the prices are very reasonable and food is worth returning for.

If you've never had Indian food before the lunch buffet is a cheap and yummy way to see what you like.

TIP: UNCC students show your ID for 10% off. A bunch buffet comes out to less than $7 for all you can eat. Where is this, Vegas? Just show me the slot machine!

After two years of ethnographic observation, I think I cracked the Indian Buffet Code. In general the buffet consists of something like this:

Carbs:
- Pyaz Pakora: crispy deep fried onions. Yummy
- White rice with peas
- Fried vegetable rice
- Butter Naan and Garlic Naan

Then about 3 or 4 vegetable curries, such as
- Something beany: Channa masala, Dal
- Something greeny: Saag Paneer, Aloo Gobi Palak
- Something creamy: Paneer Tikki Masala, Shai Paneer
- Spiced Cabbage(y): I can never eat enough this

And then about three Chicken dishes (with a Lamb mixed in there sometimes too):
- Tandoori chicken
- Chicken Tikki Masala
- Chicken Saag
- Butter Chicken Masala

Dessert- about 1 or 2 of the following:
- Rice Kheer 
- Gulab Jamun
- Sliced fruit (oranges, watermelon)

With the variety and consist quality, I'll be coming back here as long as I am a student at UNCC!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Indian food, but it took this place to convince my wife how great it can be.  

We have eaten here three times at the restaurant and three times with takeout.  It's damn good.  My wife keeps it simple with the Tandoori Chicken Machkni.  I have had a bunch of different things and I will be using this place to educate myself about Indian food.  The Lamb Rogan Josh and the Andrea Curry are both awesome.  The service is always good.  It's a new place with an occasional hiccup, but they always work hard to fix the problems.

If I felt more qualified to rate Indian food I'd give this place five stars, but it's a solid four to be sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going here all throughout college. We started out going for dinner but only occasionally, because it's pretty pricey. Then one day we went for the buffet and now that's the only time we will go! It's pretty cheap and they have a great selection. It all tastes amazing to me and nothing is too spicy. The unlimited garlic naan is obviously one of the best parts."}
{"text":"This is nice and clean Indian Restaurant near UNCC. The place is little too small for a restaurant but they get around it.  Good place to get a quick bite. I like their taste and they are pretty close to where I live so I go there more often then any other Indian Restaurant in Charlotte. 

The best deal in town $3.99 for lunch box (take out) M-F which is perfect for student."}
{"text":"Such a great deal for a take out buffet.  
The food is delicious & staff is both helpful & nice."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant.  Went here for lunch with my wife.  Didn't expect the buffet.  We tried it and it was delicious.  The only issue I have with the food was it was a little on the cold side.  As if their steam table wasn't working.  I know food is suppose to be kept at a certain temperature.  If the food was hotter I would have given this place 5 stars.  Indian cuisine is usually very spicy but their food is not as spicy as you would expect.  I will recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good choice for my first Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  The staff was attentive, helpful, and polite.  The restaurant is conveniently located near the university and residential area which I stayed near.  My food was hot and carefully packaged.  
I hope they will have Indian style rice packaging versus the Chinese rice boxes in the future. Tee hee.  They have amazing prices so I got a good meal under $15.  I ordered the butter naan, chicken bhuna, carrot hawla, and got the gulab jamun with the yelp special for free.  The servings was enough for two people.  The carrot hawla needed more sugar and the gulab James was a little soggy but both still enjoyable. BI will come back.  It may be too tight to eat inside as business was steady and parking was tight too."}
{"text":"Nice location nice ambience - but poor service and poorer quality food. 

Not recommended if you are looking for authentic Indian food"}
{"text":"The buffet was excellent.  Biriyani had a wonderful spicy flavor. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is usually top notch and their Veggie Korma is THE BEST! All the food is great and this restaurant has a really nice atmosphere. I like eating alone and reading and this place works nicely for that. It is also great for a date night or going to lunch with co-workers. The free, self-serve chai tea during lunch buffet is a nice touch. Also, they are open later than most restaurants which makes this place perfect in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it has the best naan in town, and the amazing chicken marsala is hard to stop when its buffet hour. I really hope this place lasts, that particular location is hidden to people for some reason. I have lived down the street my whole life and some locations are funny. Their food is so good, it will prevail."}
{"text":"If your not familiar with traditional Indian dishes, try the buffet during the afternoon. 

Hot and tasty traditional good at its best."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple times. The food was excellent and copious.  The wait staff is friendly and very helpful.  I  have not had  a lot of experience with India cuisine, and the young lady helped me choose the most yummy dishes.  I don't know if they are busy at other times, but we hardly saw anyone in the both times,  or when we drive by. With food this good, I don't get why the restaurant is not packed. After reading the reviews, we still need to try the buffet."}
{"text":"I got the chicken chettinad and it was awesome. I ordered spicy and the spice level was great, most places don't get the spice right in my opinion, they always go to light, Passage to India got it right! The fish fry was great, my boyfriend got the tandoori chicken and lived it! They just made repeat coustomers of us tonight!"}
{"text":"Buffets are quite the norm here in this city; it's still taking me some time to get used to this fact.

If you are in the mood for some quick Indian food, Passage to India is a great place to satisfy your quest.  The food is ok, if a bit watered down.  But for about $7 lunch buffet, the food is passable.

I wish there was the more expensive lamb, which I'd gladly pay $10 for, in a lunch buffet.  

I'd come back if I was hungry and needed a quick Indian food fix.  Otherwise, I'd go to another one of my favorite haunts in South Charlotte.

Pluses for the quick, attentive service, and overall positive vibe."}
{"text":"Good was pretty good and service was the same.  My only issue is that they brought my soup with my entree - so make sure to ask for soup first if desired.

Butter chicken was nicely prepared.  It came with a side of plain rice which was a nice compliment.  I also ordered some Buttered Naan.  Good as well.

The parking lot was empty as was the restaurant.  I am not sure why.  The restaurant is a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food ever! Happy is friendly and accommodating! His dad does all the fabulous dishes! Totally satisfying"}
{"text":"My husband started eating Indian food because of this restaurant (and grandma's cooking, ofcourse!). Their dishes are simply delicious! Awesome buffet all afternoon throughout the week. Try this and you won't find anything better in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but now there's no lunch buffet during the week! Combination plates are a joke; I do not want a plate full of rice :("}
{"text":"Went there April 2nd, the hostess sat me in a booth table even though I was alone, I liked that.  The servers were two sisters so this is apparently a family business, another plus.  They had Heineken on draft, can't beat that.  As for the food, though, I ordered the chicken Tandoori to play it safe.  It was prepared smothered with onions, I was not used to that.  It was still good but I don't think all the onions helped.  I also ordered a vegetable soup which was quite spicy, but of course that is to be expected with Indian food.  Overall the servers were friendly and attentive.

   So I will return to Passage to India, but not right away."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it two stars is because the food, which I would have given 4 stars for the taste to price ratio but I'll tell you about the service later. I got the lamb tikka masala and my boyfriend got the chicken tikka masala. My lamb was medium spice and was seasoned amazingly. The chicken tikka masala was very creamy and balanced well for the rice. It was good food for its price (11.99-12.99). Unfortunately, the stars are so low because we were originally the ONLY people in there to dine, and they rushed to the back and scurried to bring up water and such. We interacted with people 3-4 times, they forgot our drink we ordered and had to remind her (still only customers), my water ran out half way through eating and they didn't refill it til I was already done and asked for a box, we waited too long for our check considering how dead it was, and I don't think they asked how our food was until after we finished it. Overall we will probably grub hub or take out order any future orders because the food is good but service was garbage considering it was a Monday night and no one else was really there."}
{"text":"Decided to come back to this gem while I was in the area.  I ordered Manchurian Gobi (Deep Fried Cauliflower, saut√©ed with onions & green peppers) and Lamb Vindaloo.   Service was still great and the food was phenomenal.  The cauliflower was so tender you could pass it off as meat.  The lamb was tender and the sauce was on point, full of flavor & seasoned well."}
{"text":"I love coming to places like this, only because it's family owned and it helps out our local restaurants. Stopped by here with a group of friends and the restaurant was empty. Two lovely ladies greeted us with smiles and were very nice. I ordered the Aloo Gobi and rice. I am on a vegan diet for the moment so I had to ask questions to ensure the meal was dairy and meat free and the server though wasn't confident my specific meal was, but she ensured that everything is cooked to order and not mixed in advance, so whatever I would want they can make it the way I want  it. The aloo Gobi was delicious and it came with rice, and every thing tasted very good. One of my friends ordered the chicken biryani but he got the veggie instead which the server noticed as she brought the meals, so she took it back immediately and the correct dish came out shortly after that. Everyone enjoyed their meals and naan bread too. Would definitely recommend it to everything."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price they offer.  Lunch buffet is $6.99 per person all you can eat different type of curry. If you're a curry fanatic this is the place. This is my first Indian restaurant and so far I like it except for the strong curry smell.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've tried!!  The first time I've tried Indian food was here and got addicted!!The prices are good and even the atmosphere is great. Love this place and recommend it to anyone who loves Indian food or wants to try it."}
{"text":"Went here a few nights ago. Worst $15 I spent. Which I spent $15 on 1 order of chicken tikka masala and 1 order of garlic naan. I had been craving it so I didnt mind the price. When I got my food it came with a little baby container of white rice, even though he said it was Basmati rice. The chicken had a ton of fat on it and was grossing me out. The best part was I found multiple hairs in my food. The sauce was not even good. It tasted like tomato soup with a sprinkle of spice. Overall for the price and experience with this food I would never go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite and had the pankoras, samosas, naan with broccoli, and calamari. Everything was delicious, service was great, and we were seated right when we arrived. Huge menu too, which provides something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Indian food in the east valley.  I've taken no less than 10 friends over the past couple years and all have loved it.  We've sampled lots of menu items and found the vast majority to be terrific.  My personal faves are chicken tikka masala, korma with prawns and the aloo gobhi.  My favorite naan is the onion flavor - delicious!  The mango lassi is also very good.  My friend, a fellow Indian food aficionado, says their curry is the best in the valley.  They're never all that busy, even during the lunch buffet, so it's easy to grab a table.  But, if takeout's more your thing, they now deliver via DoorDash.  What's not to like?  Five enthusiastic stars from me!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery off of Eat24. There was a $20 minimum for delivery so I ordered 2 entrees to last me all week.  My order arrived right at the scheduled delivery time. 

I am a vegetarian so I ordered the Vegetable Jalfrezi and the mushroom palak (both medium spice) with garlic naan. The vegetable jalfrezi was the most flavorful that I've ever had, like literally amazing! The mushroom palak is also a very delicious option to my normal go-to palak paneer. I definitely recommend ordering from here, your taste buds will thank you later :)"}
{"text":"I've had Indian in London, in Germany, in California and this is hands down still my favorite Indian spot. The buffet is around $7.

Not only is the food great, the service is impeccable. I can't remember a time that I ever had an empty glass of water or an empty plate ready to be taken from the table for more than a minute. Food levels in the pans are also closely monitored by staff so they are never out of anything.

It gets slammed at lunch so I usually come when they first open.

When are we getting an Uptown location???"}
{"text":"The food is fine. My friends like their rice dishes a lot and I love the Kirchi ka Salan - nice and spicy. But the service makes it a no-go. They've improved their in-person wait staff a lot and that's great. But the staff don't know what the dishes are most of the time and can't answer questions because they don't know what is in them and they've never eaten them. The menu is unreliable and often they will say you can't have something because they don't have it that day or the chef is out. I have *never* been able to order from their south Indian menu. Half the time their phone is off the hook so you can't order takeout and grubhub has had to cancel my order because they don't have what their grubhub menu says they have. 

So, all in all, there are lots of good Indian places in Tempe. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden jewel the food is fresh and the flavors are so delicious and fragrant. We ordered delivery and went to the actual restaurant the next day. The calamari is to die for. The goat curry was very tender. you must also try the butter chicken. The naan was hot and fresh. I can't say anything bad about this place. Delivery was awesome as well our food was still hot."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The food is outstanding. We try something new every time, and don't know much about Indian food, but are never disappointed. We usually sit at the bar, which is often empty, but the manager/owner is always there bartending and he is great! Great local beer selection as well."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. We did come toward the end around 215 pm.  They did have a decent spread of food. The buffet included veg and non veg appetizers. Main course included Lamb curry, tandoori chicken, couple vegetable entrees, chicken tikka masala as well as chicken and vegetable biriyani. They also had a separate salad/desert bar.

The food unfortunately seemed like it had been there on the warmer for a few hours. The chicken was dried out. The biriyani rice was also quite dry. We were 8 adults so some of the items ran out. When we called the staff of they could re stock some of it they said the chef had already left and there was nothing they could do about it. This was around 245 so technically food should be kept available since they advertise the buffet being open till 3 pm. Regardless the food over all was average at best. Could use more spice and seasoning. 

I would recommend that you go earlier in the day if you wanna try the buffet."}
{"text":"Passage to bad food ..right.. I know Indian food as I am Indian . This place should not do business in food. Extreme salty chicken curry.. Goat curry was more goat soup..there was no variety... Service was so so... When told the server about salty food she smiles and said.. Sometime they are in the mood for salt .... You kidding me.. It's worth $5. Buffet... Why do all these people think they can run restaurant..  Blue moon beer with no orange slice...I bet you it is Indian restaurant with illegal Mexican cooks..
Not coming back again.. I tried and very very disappointed...  I would not bring anyone and suggest it to anyone..."}
{"text":"Come here for their weekday lunch buffet! It is truly the best. Dinner is great too and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Last night I went there...awful food..I think they changed chef. Hakka Noodles tasted like straight out of a Top Ramen packed box. Malai Kofta was ridiculous. Chapati ordered for kids made papad seem softer. and the check was approx 51$. Worst spend 50 dollars of my life."}
{"text":"Great meal.  I ordered lamb rogan josh rather than my usual korma.  Great flavor, and the heat matched my \"extra spicy\" order.  Service was prompt and polite.  Gulab jamun for dessert was pretty good too.

The only reason I didn't give five stars was that there were two flies buzzing around when I was first seated.  Not sure what happened to them after that, but they did disappear before my meal arrived."}
{"text":"The only thing that stopped me from giving this place five stars was the fact that our server had a bit of attitude.  She seemed surly and cross.  However, with that said, the food is amazing.  

I had chicken curry while my friend had Tandoori Chicken.  The curry was northern Indian and absolutely delicious.  

Fresh garlic naan and basmati rice.  Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Having just hit my 10-year anniversary living in the Charlotte area, I've come to the sad conclusion that there simply aren't very many good Indian restaurants in the area.  There are quite a few in number, but none of them have really ever bowled me over.  This changed after dining at Passage to India on a cold Friday night.

It is an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall in the University area of Charlotte.  Sharing its location with a head shop, a supplement store, and a chain pizza place, you wouldn't think you'd struck gold until the food starts coming.

We started with onion bhaji, which are basically onion fritters.  These came with a tamarind chutney and a cilantro chutney as dipping sauces.  The fritters were perfectly fried, not greasy, and must have come right out of the frying basket because they were nice and piping hot.  Salted well with an excellent crunch, the generous portion size was a welcome beginning to our meal.

For my entree, I got lamb biryani.  This has become my go-to dish because it just checks all the boxes for me.  Protein, fat, and carbs in one delicious application?  Sign me up.  It was served in a deep metal bowl that disguised just how much food they give you.  Topped with cashews, diced tomatoes, and cilantro, this was the best biryani I've had yet.  I asked for it \"very spicy\" and despite a pensive look from the gentleman serving us, they did not disappoint.  The rice was perfectly seasoned and coated with whatever magical mix of spices they use.  The cardamom added a welcome floral aroma and flavor, and the lamb was not only perfectly tender and delicious, but the dish must have been half lamb by weight.  It was utterly delicious and I got two full meals out of it.

My wife got the UK's national dish, chicken tikka masala.  I tried exactly one cube of perfectly moist and tender chicken, and a spoonful of the gravy.  It was sweet, rich, tangy, and full of flavor.  It had less of an artificial orange color as I've seen from other places, and tasted quite homemade...in the best way possible.  Her dish came with some raita, but I didn't happen to try that.

No meal is complete without bread so we got a basket of assorted breads.  You can have any kind of bread you'd like, as long as it's naan (or kulcha, but they're functionally indistinguishable).  It came with plain buttered naan, garlic naan, and onion kulcha.  Served steaming hot, every bit of it was chewy, flavorful, and delicious.

We walked in here not knowing what to expect from a basic, bare-bones decor with just a few servers kept hopping by the busy restaurant.  We walked out full, with leftovers, having paid not much money for the best Indian food we've had yet in the Charlotte area.  University City area is a hike for us, but it's a hike I'll be much happier to make if it means we're coming here."}
{"text":"Very good and tasteful food accompanied with awesome service and fast service... LOVED the veggie and lamb samosas. Highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for yummy Indian food!"}
{"text":"I won't lie, me and Passage to India go way back. I used to live in Charlotte, and when I visit Charlotte:

I always visit, my Mom, Dad, brother's, sisters, In-laws, and Passage to India. Some times all at the same time if I am lucky.

Andy has done a great job, I know he has been there since 2011 at least, and he has come a long way, the first time I met Andy I believe it was at Bombay cuisine an upscale Indian restaurant that I never really ate at, I did some wholesale deliveries there. 

What Andy has done for Charlotte, was made the best Indian Buffet, and made it available to the masses. I am perfectly comfortable with the prices, and it is well worth paying the extra for the weekend buffet. I am always sure to stop by and visit him when I am in Charlotte.

Things I like on the buffet:

Gulab Jamon (Usually Weekend)
Rice Pudding 
Chilli Gobi
Gobi fish (Weekend)
Tandoori Chicken
Butter Chicken
anything Naan

Not going to lie, I don't know all the dishes by name, but I eat it and love it. I remember another reviewer mentioning a paneer dish. Definitely need to get that on your plate too.

I usually come for the lunch buffet, as I am more of a budget/binge Indian eater."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 50 times and I have had 50 great meals. I'm trying to find something on the menu I don't like. I have not found it yet. I highly recommend the Tandoori Chicken Makhni. It is my new favorite. They have a great beer selection and $2 Happy Hour Stella Artois and Heineken. Heaven."}
{"text":"The lunch boxes are extremely reasonable ($5.99 w/meat, $4.99 veg).  They are also quick, delicious, and filling.  I get lunch here several time a week.  There isn't much variation in vegetarian buffet items from day to day, but I haven't gotten tired of it yet!"}
{"text":"The place is what it says. It is really a passage to india. I ordered 6 things in total. I ordered bhindi masala was good, Dal fry was also really good. Chili naan was good. Only thing I would not recommend was gobi manchurian which was not crispy. It was mild in taste.
This is a place I really liked after some time. I have tried many indian places but this is one stands out in its Taste. I saw both india and American crowd means food is tailored if you ask them to.

Highly recommends to both indian and American crowd.

Five star from me."}
{"text":"I have been at some of the best Indian restaurants in town and out of State and all of the food was fantastic. I love chicken tikka masala and out of all the restaurant I've been to I enjoyed the way you guys prepared it. The chicken was just fantastic will be back again."}
{"text":"This is our third Indian restaurant since moving to Charlotte not quite 3 weeks ago and it quickly became one of our favorites. We were out shopping for things to make our new home more livable and decided to drive by UNCC where I taught in the 1970's when we spotted Passage to India. We were glad we did. We arrived around noon and participated in their lunch buffet. The buffet had all of our favorites - Veg Pakora, Palak Paneer, Chana Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhani and a couple of Biryanis among other things. All were perfectly spiced for an American clientele, not too mild but not overly spicy. The Saag was very good as was the Paneer. The Masala was flavorful and had plenty of chicken. We definitely will take this passage again for dinner."}
{"text":"Free extra serving of rice would have made this 5 stars.  I am one of those who is staunchly in the camp of rice is cheap so why charge me for an extra serving (especially when you have the smallest servings or rice in town).

The food was good, we really enjoyed the flavor.  The table had the lamb korma, the chicken malabar, butter chicken, and the lamb kebabs (different name).  The food came out attractive and properly spiced.

They didn't get two parts of our order right: we had ordered raita, and they brought out the wrong dessert.

Water service was right on the spot.  Although even before things got busy they seemed to not be in the groove - slow.

Skip the garlic naan - way too strong.  The mango lassi is as good as any I have had in Charlotte, still not the level of what was available in Mumbai.

I would go here again but I will probably not ask for extra rice and I may come for the buffet.

UPDATE: I came back for the buffet.  I thought the biryani was better than at Persis, and the buffet had a better variety of things to eat.  I enjoy that they had goat, but unfortunately a variety of meats (lamb, possibly beef although it is not traditional), would have been appreciated.

On the menu were two chicken dishes - a tomato based sweet dish and one with bones.  Some toroidal (donut shaped) fried food.  They had a vegetable and cheese version of meatballs in what resembled korma sauce.

I strongly recommend the buffet over getting an entree because of the variety, although the entree I ordered tasted better than what was on the buffet."}
{"text":"I had a hard time here. the things we liked, were tasty, Like tandoori chicken and almond flour curry sauce. But there were a lot of bones in the goat biryani, and afterward it actually made me queasy. I know there are signs that ask you not to waste food - and I usually don't. Yet had to leave more food on my plate than I wanted to, and the server shot me a dirty look for not clearing my plate. :-/
I apologize for inconveniencing you but sometimes things happen."}
{"text":"Passage to India has the most authentic, delicious, fresh Indian food in the valley. Hands down. My go to meal is the paneer tikka masala, daal makhani, and chicken chettinadu but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The fact it is a father and son run business with an amazing attitude and gracious service seals the deal. Not all Indian restaurants treat customers this way. Been going there for 5 years and will go there forever. I can not say enough good things about this restaurant's ambiance, service, and quality. If you're searching for a great consistent Indian restaurant you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A little rough around the edges. Service and wait time are slightly below average. The food is decent we chicken tikka masala and some tandoori items our first visit and very very pleased. Our second visit we tried some of the Chinese Hakka items and left feeling disappointed. all in all I'll be back for the Indian food, and maybe try the buffet"}
{"text":"I used the love this place and would go there quite often, for the lunch buffet. You couldn't beat the price for the variety and taste for the food. However, something has changed. My last three visits I have become violently sick after consuming the food. The first and second time I chalked it up to isolated incidents, but by the third time I made the connection. I had eaten there so many times in the past with only positive experiences. 
The wait staff is personable and the restaurant is cleaned. As I said for years past I had eaten there and enjoyed the food, but now I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Passage to India....has.....indian food, duh...and... you're enjoying this, admit it...a kickin' happy hour! 

Yes, a get your drink on and go native with naam bread, simosas and tandoori chicken half off appetizers. I know, it's da bomb, yes?! 

They have a very nice bar which when I hit it up is usually just me and possibly some poor sap who has joined me and a couple dozen engineers from the various software companies around the area. I can't say I do any interacting with any of the other patrons, I have an engineer at home, why do you think I'm at the bar to begin with....! 

I do chat the bartender up and he is extremely nice and likes to watch a lot of golf and cricket...I'm learning nothing about either sport but we do talk about how little I know about Indian food and culture. Turns out I'm Indian ignorant and I get the impression he runs into this a lot so, he spends time answering a lot of questions that start with, what is this and how do you say? I tip well and he's either very patient or I tip a lot better than I realize. Who knows. 

I have had dinner here with the aforementioned engineer and we both enjoyed the meal immensely. We explained to our server our complete lack of knowledge when it came to the menu and explained our food preference by saying, \"we like curry and we like things spicy but not too spicy\". Which I suspect is the epicurean equivalent of saying, I like my food tasty but not too tasty...Our server didn't bat an eye and made a couple of suggestions and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food is very fresh, the ingredients are of very high quality and overall the prices were reasonable, the service impeccable and I truly can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 stars. Came here to try the lunch buffet. The weekend buffet today included several chicken dishes, 2 biriyani dishes, veggie dishes, a seafood/fish dish, and a goat curry. Some notable examples were chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag, and paneer makhani. Out of all the dishes I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and the aloo gobi the best for their use of bold flavor and hearty chunks of meat/veggie. Other dishes such as the chicken keema, while nice that it was included in the buffet (You don't usually see this dish at Indian buffets), tasted slightly underseasoned. I appreciated that you are given the choice of 3 different naans for your table (We chose garlic). 

The interior is quite lovely. You can tell a lot of time was placed into making the interior a welcoming, inviting space.

Service was good and the host was doing double duty as waiter. Despite his dual roles he was able to check up on us and refill drinks as needed with a friendly demeanor.

Dessert included kheer (Rice pudding) and gulab jamun. I liked how the kheer was more light, refreshing, and not overly sweet.

Our total for 2 buffet lunches and 2 sodas was around $28. The buffet was decent, and had a good variety. If I'm in the area I'd probably stop by again."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and was not disappointed!  I have been craving butter chicken since I returned from a trip abroad and have yet to find anything decent. I stumbled across this place and was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious! It was pretty expensive but they give you quite a bit of chicken, wish there was more rice and naan bread! Also wish they would make a lunch specials (smaller portions/ cheaper price) if so, I would be here everyday! I have yet to try any of there other dishes, since the butter chicken was very addicting! I'll be back again and again if not just for the butter chicken alone!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Indian food. My cousin brought me here two years ago, and I've been hooked ever since. I usually get the lunch special, which is rice, naan and two types of chicken (vegetarian option too). You get all that food for about $6. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley!! I am an Indian so I tend to be rather picky with my indian restaurants. This place has an amazing Panner Tikka Masala. The quantity is reasonable for the price. I go to this place at least a couple times a month! The service is a hit or a miss but the main waiter usually is awesome! GO TO THIS PLACE FOR GREAT INDIAN FOOD!"}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant that I decided to try on a whim when I needed some downtime, but wanted to eat out somewhere.

Very welcoming staff.  The restaurant is small enough to still give that personal feel. I spoke with the owners and other staff who are all very friendly and appreciate providing an enjoyable experience for the customer. 

They have a moderately stocked full bar with a small, but well chosen selection of beers on tap. So far I have only had a few of the appetizers, but I have been pleased with each dish I have tried. I like spicy food, and the hot is spicy enough to have great flavor and sneak up on you towards the end, but not too spicy as to not be enjoyable.

Prices are great for HH, and overall, very competitive. Given the quality of the food, well worth the price. 

Overall, a great place, and I will be back many more times. Cant wait to try the duck!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Sierra Vista we decided to try passage to India. Overall the food was good. Great variety is to choose from the buffet. The spicy chicken was my favorite with garlic naan and a mango Lasie. I try to sample different Indian food where ever I am and this is legit"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Nothing really went wrong, but I just felt like there was nothing to write home about.

For starters, we got here around 8. No one asked us to be seated. We were awkwardly standing by the door between the little space that was around the cash counter. The attendants saw us, but walked by us, and we just stood there till the two parties in front of us who were waiting to pay their bill, were done. Then the guy asked us \"can I help you?\" Yeah, um, we're hungry and would like a table, please. \"Table for two?\"

Then we were seated, but no one came by to take our drinks order or to give us the menu. I finally managed to catch someone's attention and asked for water. Then we got water, but still no menus. Repeat catching someone's attention to bring menus.

We decided on our orders and I told the server we had a free dessert coupon from Yelp. He said that's fine. My boyfriend ordered the cheese masala dosa and I ordered the chicken Chettinad. The Chettinad was delicious (although next time I would ask for mild. If you are not used to the Indian spice levels, maybe you should ask for extra mild). Also, there was a LOT of it! The rice they brought with it was very nice and flavorful, with cumin seeds and green peas. Yumm! The cheese dosa was okay, IMO. It wasn't very thin or crispy and the \"cheese\" inside wasn't cheese, but paneer. For non-Indians, paneer is a type of cheese, but for Indians, paneer is paneer, not cheese. The dosa didn't have cheese, and I didn't enjoy it like I enjoy cheese dosa usually. My paneer-loving boyfriend was very happy though, so that's that. And the potatoes, although plentiful, lacked taste and flavor. The sambhar was just okay.

We did get our free dessert though, one gulab jamun for each of us. Although even that took like 15 minutes to arrive, and I almost thought of passing off on the free dessert and just asking for the check, which then took another 10 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"My go to spot near uncc for a cheap yet filling lunch. I love the indo-chinese vegetable fried rice! Packed with spices and flavor! And i always have some left over for dinner or the next day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been perusing reviews for this location and finally decided to go. We came here and had a good Indian meal. I wouldn't say it was the best but being right around the corner from our house is so convenient for take out purposes! I am sure we will be back for takeout. We had tikka masala and Chana masala with basmati rice and butter naan. The sauce was so yummy. I could it it all day. I will definitely try out their lunch buffet sometime."}
{"text":"I don't get it when people complain about not having a lot of meat in their $9 buffet? If you want cheap dirty food, not fresh delicious food, then just go to a $9 chinese buffet where they have a lot of \"meat\" for you. Or how about be fancy like me, spend only $2 more and get the chicken chettinad. It has a lot of chicken meat and can literally feed 2 people. Hands down the best curry dish I've had, I am very satisfied, 5/5. Chicken is tender and soft, not tough to chew. The curry, oh boy, is so finger licking good. First time I had it, my eyes were closed the entire time while my wife was spoon feeding me. It felt like I just spent a million dollars on this dish for it to be this delicious. It is spicy enough to kick up your taste bud, then a lil bit of sourness kicks in, after that it leaves you with a hint of fresh curry leaves and tomatoes puree. The complexity of this dish, in terms of taste, is unbelievable."}
{"text":"We came in for Sunday lunch buffet. They had good items but none of the items were fresh. Service was fine."}
{"text":"It's pretty rare to find great buffet eats outside of Vegas. Seriously - buffets usually get sloppy, run over by hungry patrons. That's typically why I avoid them...they're usually not that appealing. However, Passage to India is a true exception to this rule of mine. 

The buffet is pretty banging. Not only is it (and the restaurant) quite clean and tidy, but you'll spy a nice selection of items. Fresh paneers, tikka masala, rice, two types of naan, fresh salads, and more. All of these items look to be frequently refreshed and judging by the full tables, this fab buffet is no secret. For just $7.50 per person (weekday) you can gorge on gorge Indian east. Some of my favorites included...

Tikka masala: Tender chunks of chicken swimming in a perfectly tomatoey sauce with a touch of cream

Cucumber, tomato and onion salad: Crisp and refreshing with bits of cilantro

Garlic naan: Hot and delightful. There's buttered naan if you prefer! 

And for those who prefer their food to go, Passage to India offers a pretty sweet deal: $3.99 for a vegetarian lunch box and $4.99 for a chicken lunch box. Those University area folks have it made here!"}
{"text":"This place delivers on great food. I love all the options of made to order bread they serve. 

If it was properly priced they would get 5 stars. I know how to make Indian food, and it costs near nothing to make. 

Why such the markup?

I have only been when there is a coupon. Typically the coupons are $6.99 for lunch buffet. That's what it should be anyway, and they'd still be making profit."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great quality. Everything. Just try it once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Not only do they have the best Indian food I've ever had, they may have some the best FOOD in general that I've ever had.  This place defines \"hole in the wall\".

We've eaten at  several Indian restaurants around Charlotte, and none of them touch Passage to India.  I dont know what they do differently, but EVERYTHING tastes good.  We've been back several times and had the food delivered and I almost would say the delivered food was better...which never happens!  And the portions are HUGE.  My wife and I ate for 3 days on $20 worth of food.

This is seriously one of the best places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I go here a lot. Like when I walk in for my (usually weekly...) take out order, they don't have to ask for my name. And I really like how personable and friendly that interaction is.

I've actually never had anything bad here, but our usual order is mutter paneer, tikka misala, and garlic naan. They also have a lunch buffet that I've only been to once, but there was a pretty good selection. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The taste and quality of each dish on the buffet is not what you'd expect from a typical cheap buffet but more of a gourmet restaurant. I loved every dish I tried - chicken masala, naan, rice, paneer. Too many great dishes to name! The service is also spectacular. Drinks refilled properly and servers were all genuinely nice to us. The only downside to the lunch buffet is that it doesn't include samosas or the coconut dessert which both can only be found on the Sunday buffet. Regardless, I'll still come back during the weekdays."}
{"text":"I went here on a business trip with an Indian colleague among us. I was not familiar with Indian cuisine but this was a pleasant surprise. We had chicken tikka masala among other dishes and it was fabulous. The atmosphere was befitting and the service was very pleasant. The price was good too. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Tempe. The ambience is quite a bit nicer than other Indian restaurants in the area. Service is always fast and friendly and the food is consistently good. My favorite dish is the vegetable korma, but everything is good!"}
{"text":"Affordable spot for decent Indian fare. The lunch buffet wasn't as great as I was anticipating, but had good rice and naan along with several traditional dishes. The to-go offer is at a great price point and would definitely recommend this for an outside-of-the-fast-food-bag lunch.

The atmosphere is really interesting. The restaurant was about half full when we arrived around 11:45am, yet it was dead silent inside. I swear we were the only group of people talking, wait staff included. It was a little odd, but can't be too picky when grabbing a workday lunch bite!"}
{"text":"A friend who notes this is her favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte brought me here on an empty stomach which was filled before the main course came out. I ordered a bhindi dish (okra) with spices which was fantastic. Before that, had the crepes from the South Indian portion of the menu andthe spicy dal (lentil) soup, both of which were excellent. Sad I did not save room for dessert, but would love to try more menu items when I return to Charlotte. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We got take-out tonight and it was great! The staff were extremely polite and friendly. We got the Lamb Tikka Masala and the Malibu Malabar entrees and garlic Naan and it was all delicious! We will be back often.

To update, we come here very often. The staff are still extremely polite and friendly. The happy hour food is awesome and cheap! We also love the drink menu - the lychee martini, the mango martini, and the kamasutra martini with passionfruit and pineapple are all delicious! The staff have made helpful recommendations about what to try too. The place is not too crowded and the service is faster these days (which others had complained about previously). I highly recommend Passage to India!"}
{"text":"This is by far is my favorite Indian Cuisine!!!! I even got family and friends hooked on their delicious Chicken and Lamb Tikki Masala. My absolute favorite is The Palak/Aloo Paneer which is Spinach and Potato dish with Garlic Buttered Naan Bread!!! Nothing compares to this dish in my opinion. I never have had any complaints. The manager who's name is Hapi and staff always greet me with a warm welcome. They are clean and have earned an A in their kitchen! Its like coming home for some good old southern cooking from Granny's house accept this is my Indian family! Try it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have been to 30 or more Indian buffet, for the price you are paying, Balanced with food selections and being in Charlotte; it is above average. For two dollars more you could go to Blue Taj for better value, but once a while I would come here on Saturday to satisfy my Indian food craving."}
{"text":"The free appetizer served was boring, thin crisps with not so flavorful mint and sweet sauces. I ordered chicken tikka masala which wasn't as creamy as I expected. It was so bad I had to give the leftover chicken to my dogs, after removing the sauce. The worst tikka masala was served with the worst garlic naan. All dry and hard, it hardly had any garlic or butter.

There wasn't a nice ambience either. The place looked clean but very old, seemed like the decor wasn't updated since 70s."}
{"text":"WOW, this was seriously delicious!  Although I would say that I am a bit of a foodie, for some reason I have not ventured much into Indian cuisine, but this place has made me a believer.  I went there for the lunch buffet this week, and although I didn't know much of what I was putting on my plate (aside from the tandoori chicken), I have to say that I absolutely loved everything that I tried.  My favorite part was the end of the buffet that the server kindly explained was a selection of chutneys.  I took some of each and really enjoyed the kick of flavor that they gave to the other dishes I was eating.  The mango and cilantro chutneys were my favorites, oh and also the coconut chutney...  Anyway, will definitely come back here with my husband for a weekend date night, goal- to make him a believer too :)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and had the typical buffet fare.  There was a vast array of food available with curries, dosas, white rice, rice with chicken, salad, some items I didn't recognize, some items I don't remember, melon, salad, mango custard, rice pudding, etc.  There was a good mixture of vegetarian and meat options.  The nan was toasty.  All three of us had one plate to many of food."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food, curry rice is really good and in a large portion size. All the curry rice is served 5 spicy automatically, if you can't eat spicy food, it's just right. but if you like spicy food, 7 is better! don't try 10 if you can't really stand the hot and spice. it's close to UNCCharlotte, but place is a bit small and you have to go to the front desk to check out"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fine and the service was excellent but the reason I come to restaurants is.....to eat and in that department PTI falls apart.

We ordered drinks to begin and I asked the waitress if the bartender knew how to make a sloe gin fizz.  She said she didn't know but would ask then came back to tell me \"he's looking it up\".  I gambled but shouldn't have as the drink was nothing even close.  Not a good start.

The four of us ordered an assortment of food and shared it between us.  The lamb meat was grisly although the taste was good.  Prawn dish was fine with big, meaty prawns but not many of them and the sauce, ordered medium, was anything but spicy.  Vindaloo was spicy enough but only about 10 chunks of chicken in the dish.  

We got both garlic and onion naan and it was good.  

Summary: It wasn't bad but isn't worth going back either."}
{"text":"went here with my parents for the weekend buffett (hello all you can eat pani puri!) honestly not the best indian food i've ever had, but then again i'm pretty picky and NOTHING out there is authentic, i don't care what they say. you have to make it at home to get real authentic taste. anyway! place was packed and seems to me their front door is a fire hazard, but whatever! food choices were decent, heavy on the vegetarian side. of the chicken choices, the chicken makhani was pretty good although the chicken pieces were cut pretty oddly. the pani for pani puri did not have any side dish that was adequate to carry it in. they had these really shallow bowls but they don't work very well for pani. the staff seemed pretty nice except when they tried to steal your plate before you were finished. weeeeirdd. overall, just another indian buffet for me, nothing spectacular. considering the choices for really good desi food are pretty slim in this area, i'll likely be back....i just don't know when. :-/"}
{"text":"Went here on weekday for lunch buffet. Was not disappointed. Prompt seating and great buffet. They were running short on high chairs but luckily a nice patron gave up one for my son. All the food was very good tiki Marsala was our favorite. The Tandoori chicken was very good as well. The Garlic Nan bread was fresh and delicious.  They are getting short a star for ignoring me when it was time to pay. $10 lunch buffet well worth the money. I will return."}
{"text":"Simply great quality, fresh food.  I'm originally from NY and I must say this Indian restaurant is great.  My wife had the chicken curry, I had the tikka masala.  We also had spinach naan and calamari.  We will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I live literally about 2-3min away from the Restaurant. I tasted Indian food for the very first time ever back in June of 2017.  I went to another restaurant earlier and was so hooked, I searched for another spot and came across this one. I've been eating here 1-2 times a week since the summer of 2017 and order the same thing each time, chicken makanni ( spelling is incorrect) w/ rice and spring rolls which comes to $16 each time. You calculate that each week 1-2 times a week, it's pretty costly.  The food is great but the service is awful every time unless Andy, the manager isn't there. I work as a Small Business Consultant and I'm big on respect, treating individuals the same and etc. I had several complaints to Andy regarding not giving me the same portion(s) each time, with prices and etc. It got to the point I came so much Andy would give me a discount w/o me asking or looking for it. Each time I go there and he's not there, I get an awful experience.  My last visit was 2 weeks ago and I asked to speak with Andy and they said he was too busy and was in the back in the kitchen. I personally left my business card for him w/ my personal cell number asking him to give me a call and follow up based on my experiences. I never once got a call or anyone that contacted me so I will no longer go to them. I don't believe in spending my hard earned money and give it to someone that doesn't value or appreciate your business. I too am a business owner and whether I'm at work or tending to my business, I treat each client of mine with the same upmost respect. I WILL NOW TRY PEACOCK located in the University area or find another Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"So good! Everything we had exceeded our expectations. Dont let the location and small size fool you. This place is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Prior to my visit, the only Indian food that I've tried was a handful of frozen meals from the supermarket. I came for the lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised. The real deal is much better. My only complaint is that there wasn't any dessert options at the time I showed up (the buffet must have run out). I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Chicago, just off Devon street. If you're not familiar with north Chicago, it's like little India and has 3 or 4 of the best Indian restaurants in America. 

So I know good Indian food. I don't need a menu to order. I know what I want and the best dishes. I thought I would have to go back to Chicago for those rich, complex, amazing, delicious Indian flavors.

I was wrong. Passage to India is the best Indian restaurant in Arizona. Go here or order takeout for dinner, please. You will not regret it. Everything is fresh, consistent and authentic."}
{"text":"I first discovered this restaurant 5 years ago when I moved into the area. I love the fact that they had a lunch buffet available 7 days a week, so I was able to go in and try a variety of different dishes for one low price. The food is also amazing! I recently moved to a new area and tried to find a new Indian restaurant. None of them could stand up to this one. Now, at least three times a month, I make the 20-minute trip back to passage of India to get lunch from my favorite Indian restaurant. Even if I don't sit down to eat, they offer a lunch box where you can get two items, rice and naan for around $7. A great deal for even better food. If you go for dinner be sure to go to their website and print off a coupon first. It's always great to save money."}
{"text":"Hard to beat for the price.... Great lunch buffet....  the service is so so but the food makes up for it...."}
{"text":"Small. Staff not friendly. Lunch special did not offer a variety. Uncharged $1 for rice. Will not be returning. Food was tasteless."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I've only had one meal here. And as I write this review I am devouring my food. I began with the vegetable samosa, this  was well made and everything you expect a samosa to be pure and simple. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Malabar with naan, the portions are large and the flavor is delicious. It's a small place and I have passed this restaurant many times, but this visit was well worth it. In a sea burger joints and pizza places its good to have someone to get a decent meal."}
{"text":"Stay clear of the buffet at a minimum. We ate there yesterday & spent most of the morning in the John. Don't know how long the food keeps sitting out on the buffet line. The chicken in the chicken masala did taste a little off and I just left it after the first bite. Haven't checked with my friends on how they are doing. I feel bad since I took them here."}
{"text":"We were staying the night in an area hotel and ordered from here -- I have always been a bit hesitant to order Indian food for delivery, but my expectations were definitely surpassed! This place had some of the most delicious and authentic Indian food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Lunch box. Do it. Your mouth will thank you. It's cheap. It's tasty. The only thing this place is missing is a drive through."}
{"text":"This is it guys, the best indian place in town! The chicken tikka masala is soooo awesome, perfect creaminess ratio. Good amount of chicken, the rice is out of this world, basically everthing was good. They dont charge an arm and a leg for garlic naan. Gotta check this place out"}
{"text":"This place has been our favorite for years. It consistent and flavorful. Love the Chicken Korma!!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever!! The staff are great (but very busy) & they always recognize us \"regulars\"."}
{"text":"One of those roving-eye-hungry lunch stops (seriously, it could have been TGIFri or Hardees, we were so starved) that turned into super-happy-belly-land. 

Tiny, as has been said. Darkly lit, too. If you're a bit of a wide load, you're going to have trouble squeezing past chairs and tables. 

Buffet is cramped but packed - all the classics present and kept refreshed. Mostly veg, with some chicken and other meats at the left end. Malai kofta, paneer masala, daal, sambar, iddly, vada, hamburger buns (wtf), biryanis, chutneys and such, along with some sweets, on the cold bar. Veg lo mein . Free paper dosas brought to the table as you sit.

10 bucks is a little high, but worth the variety of flavor and freshness of grub. Had a sip of a mango lassi - and smiled - pureed cardamom pods made my tongue sit up in surprise. Sweeeeet."}
{"text":"Smells soooo good in here. The food is yummy and reasonably priced. Try the milk ball dessert - so good."}
{"text":"My first time in Charlotte, NC we decided to go to an Indian restaurant for some yummy Indian food. This was the highest rated restaurant on Yelp, so we decided to give it a go. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Chicken Curry and Chicken Korma with Naan and it was absolutely delicious. The service was good, and it was a good sign to see many Indian and Asian patrons which gave us second opinions as to the authenticity and taste of the food. Would highly recommend to those that are looking for a great Indian restaurant to visit in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Indian food is typically not at the top of my list of favorite things to eat.  That said, I do know good food when I see.....  Let me rephrase that, when I smell... maybe that isn't the right word to use...  let's just say: when I experience it.

Despite that I do not like the smell of Currie and most Indian food looks unsightly to me, there is something to be said about the food here.  It is cooked well and has a certain richness being full of the unique complexities you might expect in well prepared Indian food.  I have had bad Indian food before: dry, bland or grossly over seasoned and spiced but you will only find good food here.

On my visit, my friends and I ordered sampler platters that featured a variety of different Indian dishes.  We only ordered two samplers for the four of us but so much food came out that they had to slide an extra table over to accommodate it all.  I feel we really got more than our money's worth eating here.

As for the environment, it is really nothing special.  The decor is sparse and the furnishings are dated and low budget.  Don't go expecting Taj Mahal surroundings, you will get far more enjoyment if you focus on the food and your good company."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! I've been here a few times and I just love it. The ONLY thing, and it's really a small thing, is the use of their chili powder. I can tell they use like a Mexican chili powder and not Kashmiri red chili powder. That's the ONLY thing! The atmosphere is great, Bollywood hits play in the background. The waiters are so nice and so fast! My favorite dish is the Chicken Korma. The samosas are great, gotta get the Mango Lassi. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time having Indian Food so I have nothing to compare it to (yet). We went for lunch on a Sat. They have a small buffet but it was plentiful. Tasted almost everything. The masala was great, the rice was flavorful, lentil soup tasty. Goat curry had an amazing flavor. Nothing was too overpowering. It was a great balance of sauce and spice. Just enough spice but not too much to choke you. The naan bread was delicious. My only negative really is that no descriptions were handy and only some names were translated to English. Perhaps the menu had descriptions but we didn't see one. Will definitely come back to try more and learn more about the food."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the average rating but more cautious about the one off poor ratings . Anyway I decided to try out . Fingers crossed . My advice stay safe by ordering only Indian foods that is very difficult to screw up even by a monkey . Means if it has tasted good in frozen u get from store these guys can make it as well . Anything authentic you wish to try this is big let down . I ordered chicken chettinad . Where is the curry leaf . Where is the tarka . It tasted like a bad jalfrezi . If you don't know what you are selling don't put it on list . Iam pissed because I drove 10 miles to have this food because of review . The veg biryani . Horrible . It's not biryani. Delivering it in a handi with top covered by dum makes it only fancy . The actual thing inside is horrible . Pardon if the words are harsh . We left it as it is . I haven't written a review for so long .  It iam absolutely disappointed today ."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend you try this place out! Their food is amazing and the staff is wonderful. Happy, the owner, is very friendly and will make sure that all of your needs are met. They go above and beyond for their customers. I highly recommend The chicken tiki masala and the vindaloo chicken!!!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is phenomenal here. I'm very picky about Indian food and this place was great. The fritters were a great alternative to the rice (which fills me up really quick ), the Naan was fresh and the curries were so good. The goat curry is actually one of the most flavorful I have found so far. I am looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Happy is so wonderful and very attentive! The food is always amazing, just like the service. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food.

We had the lunch buffet, and to drink Masala tea and mango lassi.  The food was superb.  The buffet turnover was extremely high, with new food served every few minutes.  The vegetable biriyani, goat biriyani, tandoori chicken, tikka chicken, and chicken tikki masala were all great.  The naan was crispy and the gulab jamun was par for the course.  The tea was almost certainly not from a powder, and the mango lassi differed from what I was used to by having chopped pistachios in it.  The nuts added a sense of depth and texture I have not yet seen in other mango lassi.  The dessert bar had rice pudding along with a host of unrecognizable desserts.  Absent were the expected fruit cocktail, jello, and ice cream offered at \"cheaper\" buffets.  Instead there were interesting mixes of chick peas, almonds, and other presumably homemade desserts.  I will update this review once I try their dinner menu.

Pros:

- Inexpensive.  Lunch buffet for $10 a person is great.
- Food is freshly made for a buffet and turnover is high.
- Wait staff is friendly and keeps the drinks filled.


Cons:

- There were a lot of indian customers, which I take to be a sign that the food is legit and authentic.  However the wait staff did not have a set uniform or nametags.  They were for the most part dressed casually.  It was difficult to determine who worked for Passage to India and who was a customer.

- After eating the lunch buffet, I had the worst food coma I've ever had post lunch.  The food here is heavy.  Be prepared to take a long afternoon nap after eating at Passage to India."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been here for lunch buffet and dinner. If you are not so familiar with Indian food I really recommend trying out the buffet so you can find something you like. My favorites are palak paneer which is a spinach curry dish with cheese cubes. Yumm! Other favorite curry dish is the mutter paneer, cheese cubes and green peas. Both vegetarian and both delicious. The garlic naan is a must! Price wise it is a bit cheaper than other Indian places I've visited. So if you're in the lookout for a great Indian food restaurant, give this a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Service was terrible and very slow. We ordered several main dishes from the menu all of which had no flavor. They had a terrible aftertaste too. We only ate part of 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered. Naan was very dry too. When we expressed our concerns to the staff they had a very rude response. We asked them to remove some of the dishes from the bill as we did not eat them. Manager proceeded to storm away after reluctantly agreeing and came back to toss the bill on the table.

About 30-60 min later many of our party members complained of sickness and stomach pains. Do not think this was food poisoning but the food certainly did not make us feel good.

I would never return to eat here in the future"}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service.  Friendly staff who answered all of my questions.  Some of the best Indian food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, wonderful service, and reasonable prices. This has become a monthly treat for us. We always order way too much food and leave with leftovers for days."}
{"text":"Clean. Tasty. Had a couple of lamb dishes and a chicken dish. Nice flavor. Can choose your spice level. Nice!  Service was good. Simple but clean decor. Unlike many other Indian restaurants, they do not have a big selection of teas. But the food is good."}
{"text":"this restaurant is so filthy. I ate there with my girlfriend on Monday and have been vomiting since. I just visited the hospital. not worth the food poisoning."}
{"text":"I just ate dinner at Passage to India. It was one of the best meals I've had out at a restaurant this year! We had vegetable samosas, chicken tandoori, daal makhani, and chicken tikka masala. Oh, and we had rice pudding for dessert. All of it was so good! Also loved the tea and really great service. I really don't understand why it's never that busy when we go there."}
{"text":"I ordered food for dinner tonight..... I'm not impressed with this restaurant. This is definitely NOT the best Indian food in Charlotte. 
1. My samosa was soggy and greasy... I bit into it, and all I could taste was the old grease it had been sitting in. 
2. The Basmati rice was OK... , but it didn't have the flavorful aroma of basmati- and a bit heavily seasoned with cumin. Definitely NOT cooked properly.... AND it was packed in a Chinese takeout box.... 
3.The Naan was decent 
4. The spinach and potato dish I'm very fond of, had a VERY distinctive sweet taste immediately followed by spices. Not impressed-
5. My lamb vindaloo was good. 

Overall... I won't be back. But I can understand  students craving Indian food loving this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area.  I come here at least once a week for either the lunch buffet or the \"lunchbox\" ($4-$5 and includes two sides and a meat).  This food truly tastes very \"home-cooked\" and the buffet is always clean."}
{"text":"Passage to India is getting behind on its success. This is a great buffet joint near UNC-Charlotte campus, frequented by the local community and visitors alike. At lunch, the place burst at its seams and both the buffet and the service lag behind. Food choice has become more limited and not all is available. It's a pity because passage to India is otherwise a great place with good food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"More like Passage to GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK MUTHA MUTHA!!

Listen to me people. Im an Indian Food snob. This is average Indian food at the very best. If you're in the Tempe area you can do MUUUUUCH better with a place like Kebab Palace, India Gate or even The Dhaba.

This place has a great location but it looks like some friends took what was in there garage, found a used hot food table on craigslist and stuck it in a corner of the restaurant.

Tandoori chicken that tasted boiled and had literally no flavor. 

Dry NAAN

The Chicken Tikka Masala was decent

Vegatable Pakora that was cold, along with most other dishes.

No salt, no pepper available and lastly and most irritaingly, not spicy at all!

Skip it and save your money.

THE SUCK!!!!"}
{"text":"Good indian buffet at a reasonable price 9.99 usd + tax. Food is not too spicy and its in perfect taste. They refill everything and everytime when tray is emptied. Be ready to wait for sometime during week ends as this place is crowded mostly in week ends"}
{"text":"I have tried several Indian restaurants in Charlotte and they're good, but they aren't as good as Passage to India. The atmosphere is a little dingy, and the wait staff could be friendlier, but it doesn't stop me from going back because they're food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"My go to spot in the University area.  Have tried multiple items on the menu and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 tried this place for HH. There are only drink specials which were pretty decent prices. 

Everyone love the food so much. We ordered the garlic/butter naan, kati rolls, gobi manchurian, tikka, eggplant curry, okra, so many other tasty dishes. Everyone was sharing the dishes and I loved how the Tikka Masala actually tasted like tomatoes.

The reason why I am giving this place 1 star is that the service was pretty slow, our water glasses were empty...but my guy and I felt really sick after we ate the food. Our tummies were not happy a few hours later and for the rest of the night. What worried me what the most recent reviewer about him and wife getting food poisoning...

I don't think we will be heading back to PTI any time soon for fear of getting sick again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food made with TLC. So delicious and different than any other place in town that I have tried.  Owners care and have good intention. Very fresh and ALWAYS willing to please.  I drive from the other side of town to eat here. A++ 
Thank you for always making my delicious gobi with no potatoes for me and my daughter..."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch buffet and there were a lot of great vegetarian options. Would go back."}
{"text":"Best indian food real indian spices .! The buffet is amazing i like the goat a lot .!"}
{"text":"Food was great. We ordered take out and it did take around 30 minutes, so definitely call ahead. My husband got the chicken korma and I got the chicken saag.  Both were very good!  We also got the garlic naan and papadums.  Both also great!  The only request we will make for next time is extra tamarind sauce.   Would definitely recommend for take out/pick up."}
{"text":"I had an offer for free desert, when I trued to redeem they gave reasons that you need to print it and didnt redeem it!!!
They are hesitant to to redeem the coupon. 
Weekends are better than the weekdays."}
{"text":"Best Indian food around! They deliver too which is what I did and the food came hot and not soggy. I got the chicken curry and my wife went with the chicken and rice. They were both really good. The only complaint I would have is that it wasn't spicy enough, so next time I will be asking for extra spicy curry."}
{"text":"I came here by myself last week. Upon entering it smelled delicious. I was seated at a booth. The service was excellent. 

I did find the lighting in the place to be a bit distracting.  They had these almost like flood lights outdoor lighting in some of the areas. It felt too bright in the spots and made the restaurant seem industrial, not warm and inviting. 

As my usual I got chicken Tikka masala with garlic naan. I thought the chicken Tikka was too salty. The naan was OK seemed a little dry to me.  I also had a mango lassi which was delicious. 

Overall it seemed like a nice place and maybe there were other dishes that would be delicious, but chicken Tikka masala is my favorite and if I don't like it then I'm probably not coming back. Also the lighting situation really bugged me. Maybe they don't turn those bright lights on in the day time."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat Indian food. The place doesn't look all that fancy but food is definitely one amongst the best in Charlotte. In the top 3 I would say. When it comes to top 3, it doesn't matter. They have a decent off buffet and buffet. They honored my free dessert via yelp as well. And he gave an extra dessert although it's one for table. I would suggest to try it out, but go early. Peak times are crowded..."}
{"text":"I don't know if this place was designed to be a restaurant. It looked like a big waiting area turned into a restaurant. The kitchen was hidden. The hallway to the bathroom was long, dark, and dirty. I quickly washed my hand with the door opened and got out. I had arrived for the lunch buffet. It opened at 11:30. We got there 11:38. There were already people inside eating and people coming out with take out. This place was full of people of all background! The food was so good and fresh. All the curries were good and the desserts were great. The naan was a little dry though. I'm not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you what dish I ate. Just try them all!! I'll come here again, definitely!"}
{"text":"This is a no-nonsense place. The food is normal, and reflects a typical restaurant in India: crowded, \"prison-guard customer service\" and bollywood tunes.

My two complaints: no separate bowls for curries (?) and fairly small slippery plates...like, watch out 'cause the pakora slides off. Ugh.

But for the great low price, I will give these guys a nod. 

If you have an extra few bucks to spend, check out Woodlands weekend buffet, too."}
{"text":"Food was good. Spice level 7 for Malai kofta felt less. Kofta balls as well were little less soft. Curry had stronger flavor of  tomato. Portion sizes were nice. Samosa Chaat was good. Wish they give 2 samosas instead of one. Overall nice experience. Ambience good. Service fast. I do remember they used to give Papad complimentary before I didn't see it this time."}
{"text":"I like this place, I get some really good vegetarian food here!
they also have a nice lunch buffet and is really reasonable on the price."}
{"text":"Like the lamb rice dish and the vegetarian dish with eggplant, yogurt etc. Not a fan of the Dosa here, have much better experience at other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"BEST Hyderabadi BIRYANI PHOENIX AREA.This is the best biryani  in town.Goat curry , chicken curry and CHICKEN biryani are Awesome in Buffet.Order the free DOSA in Buffet .CHEAP and best in PHOENIX Area.The owner staff are cool and friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit to this location and it was pleasant. The food was good and staff was very welcoming. I would like to see more items on the buffet."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick lunch if you work in the University area.  They have a buffet that usually has a little bit of everything, including a few vegetarian options.  

Price is mostly reasonable, although I think they should lower it just a little.  It comes out to be over $10.  I think I would go more often if they had it at 7.99 or something.  They would end up having more business!"}
{"text":"My bias: Indian food is my favorite type of food. My review: Passage to India is a hit! They start you off with papad (thin cracker) and some tasty sauces. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala (paneer is a delicious cheese that makes a great vegetarian option). Free rice with entrees, but garlic naan is a must for any entree! Quick service and reasonable prices. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience at this restaurant.
Vegetable soup was horrible , Egg noodles were not fresh and probably were made a day ago. This is not authentic taste of Indian Food , wont recommend this restaurant to any one"}
{"text":"We called the Manager, Happy, the next day after Valentines Day and he asked us to come in again so they could show us what a fluke Valentine's Day was, too many things went wrong, so we did.
Friday 02/28/14, so two weeks exactly after our bad experience, we went back in and pretty much ordered the same thing. Business was much lighter, and Happy of course checked in on us frequently. But here's the thing, the food was great, some of the best Indian fare we've had, and the atmosphere was nearly perfect, we sat in the less crowded section by the bar.
I had Kadai Lamb and my wife had Saag Lamb, both we tasty, I ordered mine a little hot, and found it enjoyable.
Passage to India has a nice layout, and good service when all is working well.  Too many things went wrong the night we first went there, and so I am pleased to see that they work hard to keep customers happy, as the manager's name suggests. They of course took care of us, cutting our dinner bill in half so we will be back, as the food and the service were both thoroughly enjoyable."}
{"text":"I had a GREAT experience!  It was my 12 year old daughter's first time eating Indian food so I asked the server what she recommended for a 12 year old eating Indian food for the first time and she was VERY helpful.  We ended up ordered Samosas, Tandoori Chicken Makhni and Palak Paneer and a side order of Nan.  The food was excellent and I couldn't have asked for better service.  The gentleman who seated us made sure we had fresh rice for our left overs and brought over some foil for our bread.  Our tea glasses never went empty.  I was very very very happy with my service and food.  I would be back again!"}
{"text":"s/o and I were visiting from out of state. both of us were craving Indian food and decided to drop by this place after looking it up on yelp. we ordered naan, mango lassi, chicken curry and chicken korma. 

all the dishes were for the most part, excellent. the entrees were well spiced, promise it'll give your taste buds a nice kick.  s/o got the chicken curry in medium; it had good amount of heat but not overbearing where you'd reach for a sip of water after every bite. chicken korma was less so but good balance of spice. plus it was super creamy!

if you get a chance order the mango lassi! it was such a delightful surprise as there were cardamom pods blended in; I had never experienced that at any other restaurant before. complaint is that it was on the thick and heavier side. wish they could have blended in some more ice to make it thinner.

also, my chicken was a bit on the dry side. wasn't tender enough to my standard. 

overall, recommend!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal, great spicy food, Indian hot,or mild if that's what you want. This restaurant is more suited to worldly people,  that know their way around a plate.
Anthony Bourdain would've of luved this place."}
{"text":"I love going to Passage to India, especially for the buffet.  When I can see the food I am about to eat, it makes all the difference in the world.  The buffet selection is varied with entrees, salad, and dessert items.  Or, if you prefer, you can order from the menu.  Lunchtime is pretty busy any day of the week so if you need a few big helpings of Indian cuisine, you can't go wrong with Passage to India."}
{"text":"(Where is The Buffet)

I ate at Passage To India for the first time two weeks ago. I would say the food is ok but not much to try because the buffet is tiny. The chicken was delicious, but the staff did not want to bring any more out because they were 30 minutes for closing. The dessert that Yelp advertised as being a part of the check-in was a fake because one of the waiters told me that the offer would only work for dinner time. Overall, it was an ok place to eat, but I felt rushed to get out of their because they were cleaning under my feet while eating, and anyone born in the South knows (that is bad luck). I would like to attempt to eat here again when they are not closing for dinner maybe it is better then. But they were quick to take our money and did not explain that they would not bring out fresh food."}
{"text":"great food....ambiance lacking....both waitresses love to call everyone \"hey guys\"...gets old realy quickly...."}
{"text":"Indian food wasn't anything special... the food was ok but the waiter our restaurant had this time told us that the food was going to be spicy and we weren't impressed. The location is nice and I hope they increase the heat."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place left me with the worst food poisoning I've ever gotten in my life! 

We came here for the weekend buffet, the little place was crowded...a good sign since quite a few of the patrons were Indian themselves. The buffet selection was also good, they even had a pani puri station, seemed cool. I grabbed quite a few things but all were mediocre. I think what got me was the paneer tikka masala..I ate some (my bf didn't touch it) and in my head told myself..hey this isn't the right texture for tikka masala..something's off...and then 6 hours later I was barfing my guts out for the following 24 hours. 

I'm sure this was an off day as my bf and his room mates have eaten here many times before. Sadly, I don't think I'll be eating here ever again, I'm basically scarred for life. The buffet is large and cheap..but considering my experience you may want to stick to the a la carte menu. 

Good luck."}
{"text":"We were there Friday, 2/01 and had the worse service ever.  It was busy and we had no reservations, sat in the bar, and ordered appitizers and one drink while waiting for a table.  The bar tender was awesome, but the food never came and we had to cash out to go to the table which was ready in about a half hour.  Once seated, we didn't get any attention after that.  We asked the hostess for our appitizers and she said she would check...  nothing...  we finally got a waiter after he had a discussion with another waiter in our presense about 'who would take us', and never got to order.  He said he'd be right back...  we asked him about our apps...  he would check...  we ordered dinner...  and again asked about our appitizers...  he came back after we had been seated for 45 minutes at our table (1.25 hrs after placing that appitizer order), and he said he didn't know what to say.  The order was never placed.  So we said we wanted our money back and wanted to leave.  He took our paid receipt, went back to 'talk with someone' and said the charge would be voided.  Today (2/7) I checked my credit card company, and not only was the $22.88 charge processed...  they processed it for $26.88 ($4 more!!).   Amazing.   So who knows about the food?  We sure don't and wasted 1.5 hrs total for nothing but a credit card problem that's now under dispute."}
{"text":"Went with a group of coworkers for the lunch buffet. They sat our table of five quickly and we went straight to the buffet. All of the buffet items I tried were very good and I liked that they had the Indian name and an English description for each item. Very good for $8 or $9."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. The flavor and spices are so authentic. I absolutely love this place. Great food, great service. Awesome location and parking. I give it a million stars"}
{"text":"Great food.  Lunch box's are awesome  veg: $3.99, meat: $4.99.  Comes with oven baked flat bread.  Good service and clean.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just moved to charlotte and I was searching for good Indian food around University City. I was relieved once I found Passage to India....I got the lunch special with two different flavors of Curry chicken...its been three hours and my mouth us still exploding with flavor."}
{"text":"Firstly, so annoyed with the restaurant, pre-ordered a meal which was then nearly an hour late. Driver was amusingly trying to get a tip after not reading the notes and delaying my food further by going to the wrong hotel and the food was cold so I had to microwave it. HOWEVER they are spared a 1 star review as the food was actually excellent, just get your stuff together with deliveries guys please!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best biryani in charlotte. Order the goat biryani..you will not regret this decision you made in life!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Sunday night..it was really quite at 6.30pm.but filled up nearer 8pm. Phew. We thought the absence of people was a sign of food quality. Think again. The food was great quite authentic having traveled several times to india. The spice could have been more..but great flavour and portion sizes. Service pretty average but good food.."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Charlotte university area! They're chicken tikka masala is life changing. Since graduating UNCC I've moved to Winston-Salem, but I still make that hour and a half drive sometimes just to eat at this restaurant. 
Food is priced fairly and service is great. 

I recommend the garlic naan bread and  chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"We had the buffet when we went there for lunch.  The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  If I compare it to some other Indian places I wouldn't go back. The flavors didn't seem as smooth and blended. It felt rushed. The customer service wasn't bad... but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"One of the worst staff with attitude and worst service. The slim guy in the specs is filled with ego and pride with an audacity to argue with customers. We ordered 2 goat dum biryanis to go. And this is what we heard on the phone - \"Your order will be ready in 35 minutes Sir\". We reach the place after 40 minutes and the guy says it'll take a few more minutes. We wait for another 10 minutes outside the restaurant. That's when I start getting angry. But finally after 50 minutes, the order is ready. The only thing I tell the guy with the specs is that if you say 35 minutes, please try and make sure that it is ready in 35 minutes. He first argues that we ordered at 1:40 PM. I asked him to see the time and it was 2:31 PM. He said sure and me and my friends go sit in the car about to start driving back home. The guy has the audacity to come out to the parking lot and start arguing that goat dum biryani takes a lot of time, and he had said \"About 35 minutes\" on the phone and not just 35 minutes. So basically he is trying to say that his \"ABOUT\" 35 minutes has a buffer of +/- 15 minutes. Such ego is not good for business and I'm surprised that a staff member can have such audacity to talk to customers like that. They need to understand that even 3 Michelin star restaurants have a cut off time of 30 minutes for an order. Or at least they'll tell the correct amount of time required. 

First of all we have to have the greasy food that these people make, and on top of that we have to bear such humiliating behavior from the staff. All I can say is that they just lost good customers.

I wouldn't even give 1 star but that's the minimum one can give."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch buffet.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall with an awkward parking lot, but once you get into the place, the entire dining room is filled with the aroma of food.

Yes it is a buffet, but they kept it very well stocked and very neat.   The food was good (I ate too much naturally).  Lots of vegetarian options.  Now, I am not an Indian food expert, but I felt pretty satisfied with the price and the food.

Servers were very nice and kept our drinks refilled and the tabled bused even though the lunch crowd was growing and busy.

The place is pretty cramped and doesn't have much atmosphere, but face it, it really makes the food the star.  There is a nice mural of the Taj Mahal on the wall but other than that, nothing too tricky or gimmicky here."}
{"text":"I was kinda excited to have finally get to eat Indian food since moving from California a few months ago. Today, I've been craving for curry. I had the calamari and garlic naan, they were good. Then, I tried some of the Goat curry which was a little salty, the portions are a little small for the price. I had experienced better with more portions for the same price I paid here."}
{"text":"We love it and the lunch buffet can't be beat! Each time I go there is always something new out I have never tried. I also love that majority of the dishes are vegetarian and those that aren't are placed at the end of the buffet. I haven't ordered from the menu yet but plan to in the near future. Bottom line...if you are in the university area and like Indian food you must stop here!"}
{"text":"I went to Passage to India with a couple of friends for lunch. It is basically right across from the UNC Charlotte campus so it is quick to grab lunch off campus. We all got the buffet for lunch. It's about $10 for the lunch buffet. The buffet isn't huge - but it has a good assortment of different dishes. All of the food was flavorful and delicious. I have not had much Indian food before so the buffet was perfect for me - I got to sample the different dishes/sauces."}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service was really bad. I was there for the pick up and the guy was really rude and mad at something. He gave me a very bad attitude.. I hope you guys have a better customer service."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! Most Indian restaurants skimp on the spice when I say I want something spicy but this place didn't. They definitely delivered great flavor and spice for my Chana masala.  I appreciate that they have such a broad menu and the takeout and dinner service are great!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! We ordered the Tandoori King Prawns, Chicken Vindaloo and the Goat Saag with some Naan for carryout. They did forget one part of my meal and I had to go back for but the customer service was excellent and made me a happy customer instantly. All of the dishes were hot, prepared well and tasted incredible, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Interior was dark, intimate and very clean; it would be a great date place and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Great value for your money. Their takeout is fast. I leave work a lot and she will order it. Within 20 mins its ready and your in and out no problems."}
{"text":"We eat at PTI about once a month and absolutely love the weekend lunch buffet.  The buffet consists of some hot soups, hot dishes and a small salad bar.  The standouts are the vegetable Pakora, chicken Paneer, chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer and the always spicy vegetable Biryani.  The food is always hot (not warm) and all the options are wonderfully delicious.  The staff is always pleasant and the restaurant is always clean.  If you're near Tempe and your tummy is in the mood for some tasty Indian food, plug in Passage to India into Google Maps.

*Tip 1*  
They typically offer a $2 draft.  Last time it was Heineken.

**Tip 2**
Check your local mailers.  I've received several discount coupons from PTI over the last 2 years

***Tip 3***
They have a full bar!!"}
{"text":"Finally.... a good Dum Biryani in Tempe. Been to this place twice and twice I was place a couple of time and both times, I had good experience.

Dum Biryani, Mirchi Ka Salan were great.
Pakoda and Manchurian were good.

The food was really good and I hear that their happy hours are good too! Should try it sometime soon!"}
