{"text":"My wife's friend, who apparently is a bigger pho fan than I am, swears that this is THE place for pho. I was giddy...I've never met anyone who loves pho as much as I do.  I didn't think twice and made the trip there the very next day. Even starved myself in the morning, skipping breakfast just so I can fully experience this heavenly pho.

It was half past noon when I got there. The soup should be at the perfect temperature by then. The place was relatively empty.  Good! Because I hate to feel rushed when it's my first time.  The tables and set up was relatively ghetto. Perfect! I've been to a fancy pho place before where they trim the bean sprouts but it was almost always a 'meh' experience.

Ordered the pho tai sach (beef with tribe) and a side of spring rolls. My wife had the special. Water for us both (was disappointed that they didn't provide us with ice but whatev, strike one!). I was ready to be blown away.  

A couple of spoonful later... it....was....ok but it's not GREAT! The soup was flavorful but on the saltier side. Definitely tasted a lot of MSG. Spring rolls was 'meh'.  I was gulping down my luke warm water with dismay. There was too much hype going in to this thing and I really wanted to love it. I wanted to lick the bowl when I'm done. I wanted to order another bowl and be so full, I wouldn't be able to move. I wanted this place to be THE place so I would stop my quest to find that perfect bowl of pho.

But I didn't.

I was disappointed. 3 stars at best. So why did I give 2 stars then? Let's nitpick a little. The server was cleaning the table and refilling utensils behind me while I was eating. I heard her dropped a bunch of spoons. She picked it up and refilled the spoon slots with it (3 second rule?). Personally, I don't really care. I've been to Vietnam, Cambodia whatever and they just dip the dirty utensils in the water bucket and call it a day so that didn't bother me. Strike 2!

I went to pay and it's rather awkward spot because there's a table right behind me and I barely had room to pay. In fact, I bumped my elbow on that awkward paying area and was about to scream. The cashier lady didn't look like she had a good day. A smile would of earned her an extra buck for tips.  Strike 3!  

If you like pho as much as I do, it's important to try the crappy ones so you can really enjoy the good ones. Sooooo try this place. Food is decent but don't starve yourself and then make a long a$$ trip all the way from the NW just for this. 

As for my wife's friend...she might be a big fan of pho but I still reign supreme."}
{"text":"After traveling on the plane for the whole day we finally arrived in calgary and I was craving pho. The sate pho is good. Regular pho is also not bad. Doesn't take usd though."}
{"text":"Had the peanut sauce chicken pho in beef broth and added some sriracha it was pretty tasty !"}
{"text":"The Pho Tai (Slices of rare Steak Beef Noodle Soup - No. 5) is pretty good and for $6.50 (large) is good value for money.

Don't order the beef balls for an extra $1 though - they just add one beef ball and cut up into smaller pieces.

I would have given this place two stars but my wife loves the Special Beef Noodle Soup (No. 4)."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! And the avocado milkshakes are the best.  Best pho I've had in Calgary"}
{"text":"This is a joke of a business. I didn't get a menu, no one took my order and my drinks weren't even made. Their salad rolls are complete crap at $6 for 3 rolls. They're filled with vermicelli and salad with one tiny tasteless shrimp cut in half placed on either side of the roll. Where is the pork?? The spoons smell of pure bleach, so I couldn't even use one. Time to replace them!! I asked for scissors and spoon so my son could eat, never got them. All they seemed concerned with was cleaning tables. The only reason they even get 2 stars is because the pho itself is done well. The soup base is good. If you come here, just order the pho and ask for a metal spoon. I should've driven the extra 10 minutes to go to the hood for real Viet food."}
