{"text":"We haven't been to Red Robin in probably a year or two until tonight.  My husband and I decided to go tonight.  We sat at the bar because it was just the two of us, and were greeted by Cara right away.  She was an amazing bartender from the time she greeted us until the time we left!  Really did an amazing job, she was on top of everything including noticing that we were watching the hockey game on a far TV And offered to change the one in front of us before we even asked.  The food was really good too!  I came out fast and everything was good!  We will definitely be back and definitely be looking to be served by Cara!"}
{"text":"Exceptional slow service this evening.  One member of our party asked for additional fires.  They advertise endless fries!  After waiting 15 minutes and never getting them, we just left."}
