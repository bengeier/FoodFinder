{"text":"Makkah reigns over cheap and lip-smacking take-out options on the Danforth.  The fresh naan is soft with a bit of crispness and perfect for enclosing their perfectly spiced and creamy dhal as a vessel to the mouth.  My favorite, of course, is the aloo gobi, rich and singing harmonious notes of flavour, it makes me happier with every bite.    The guys at Makkah never disappoint and they often offer $5 specials; the food, however, is always special."}
{"text":"There are so many excellent Indian restaurants in this area that my husband and I routinely dine at, this one just didn't measure up.  It was our first time ordering from Makkah, so I'm willing to write off the awful food we received as the kitchen having a bad night.  We ordered the meat special for two as well as some palak paneer.  The food arrived via delivery still hot and the delivery person was very pleasant.  The food however, was surprisingly unpleasant.  The vegetable of the day dish was overly oily and heavily spiced with chilli without any real depth of flavour.  That really describes all of the food, overly spicy without any real depth.  We both love hot foods, so it wasn't that, it was the one \"hot\" note and nothing else.  The palak panner was black and greasy at best, with approximately 5 cubes of paneer.  The same was true of the chick curry (our selected meat of the day), the chicken was cooked well, but the curry was like water and there was barley any chicken to speak of.  Finally, the naan was very thick and unlike any naan I've ever had.  It was more like pizza crust actually.  As I said, this very well could have been an off night for the kitchen, which happens.  It's just hard to think about ordering from them again when there are so many other amazing Indian/Pakistani restaurants in this city."}
{"text":"First time delivery order of $60. Got the lamb biryani, tandoori platter, rice side, curry chicken, naan. Tandoori plate is not a $17 platter. There is hardly any lamb in the biryani. The curry chicken is the worst I've had.  Despite leaving instructions on how to get to our tucked away place being printed on the receipt the delivery boy blatantly denied them being there.   Tip is automatically charged. Rude delivery staff. Would not order."}
{"text":"Food was not very good. I've had much better Indian food before. The food I had - the curry was incredibly oily and liquidy compared to  the thicker much better tasting curries I've had in the past. I wouldn't go here again, despite the food being at a pretty reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've heard it said before that is this is one of the better Pakistani options we have around town. I can't really speak from any deep font of experience or anything but I can certainly believe it.  Occasionally they will have deals such as chicken biryani for $3.99 or a kebab sandwich and a pop for $5. The regular menu itself is pretty affordable for what you get from it. Their curries are pretty decent but where they really shine is with anything cooked in their tandoor. They use a charcoal fired tandoor (as opposed to a gas one) which imparts that extra bit of extra smokey oomph in the flavour of their foods.   Their naans are really tasty and are a sizeable portion unto themselves in comparison to other places. I really recommend their tandoori quail however. Of course, you've got always got the choice of those standard veggie options (channa masala, saag paneer, aloo gobi, etc.) as well as a few seafood picks.  If you decide to eat in, please note that they were really going for the cafeteria vibe when they planned it (complete with plastic cutlery and plates along with trays you need to tilt as you shove everything on them into a rectangular garbage receptacle). Thankfully, I'm too busy enjoying my food to notice my surroundings when I eat in here."}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery over the long weekend. It took about an hour, but the food was hot, delicious and well packed. I really liked the spiciness of the beef samosas and the tandoori chicken. The butter chicken was a definite crowd pleaser, the sauce wonderful to sop up with the warm and chewy naan.  We also ordered chicken pakoras, Aloo Gobi, Dal and rice pulao. All tasty.  Our guests were new to Indo-Pakistani food, but they snarfed up the food with gusto.  All in all, the price was very reasonable for the amount of food we received and the quality was great. I would definitely order from Makkah again."}
{"text":"I went in today and the guy at the counter told me the Tuesday special for $4.50. When I gave him $10 he only gave me $5 back. I waited a few sec to see if he would give my complete change back but he was rude and I took my food and left.  I was very disappointed by the service woukdn't go there again!!)  **** I edited my original review!  In the response he sounded a little condicending but I enjoyed the food overall!! *****  In the service business you need to communicate that's all."}
{"text":"I go here several times a month and the quality is consistently great. The staff are always extremely friendly and the food arrives quickly. The usual options are available like samosas and tandoori chicken, but they also have some less standard things like grilled quail and curry fish.   As others have mentioned, the price can't be beat, you will never pay even $10 for a filling, flavorful, fast meal.  The homemade bread is excellent, always just a little crispy but still soft.   The place is a bit threadbare in appearance e.g. there is often cardboard on the floor during the bad weather and there are fake potted plants. They're not licensed so the drink options are just a few sodas or water.   Makkah is a little too greasy to ever earn a five-star rating, but for the price it's often the perfect weeknight option. They also offer big platters for parties which I'd like to try at some point.   There are lots of cheap takeout places on the Danforth - LOTS. Within a block of Makkah there is square boy, a turkish kebab place, various fried chicken places, Danforth Dragon, Danforth Pizza house, it's ground zero of cheap takeout on the east side. Yet Makkah thrives which suggests it's got something pretty good to offer."}
{"text":"Excellent tandoori chicken, lamb curry and chicken biryani :) plus, very reasonable price :P"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure with fresh, delicious Indian and Pakistani food. I often come here and take the food to go and have a beer at the nearby The Only Cafe. (The Only doesn't mind if you bring in food from outside since they lack a kitchen.)"}
{"text":"This is authentic for sure. One of my favourite spots in the city for Pakistani food. The naan bread is perfect as is the tandoori chicken. Just be warned that dishes are seriously spicy in some cases. I love spicy believe me but if you aren't accustomed then make sure you ask in advance as you'll sweat and breathe fire."}
{"text":"So delicious! And so fast! Friendly service and delivery for a great price. Don't ever change!"}
{"text":"Terrific Indian/Pakistani foodd.  I've been to high end eat-in restaurants and this beats them all.  The chili chicken is spicy, tasty and it's a generous portion.  Best Naan in the City - Don't let the surroundings set your expectations, the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Unbelievable naan... don't expect any ambience whatsoever but if fresh tasty food is what you want, this is the place ! Naan and seekh or naan and Bihari kabab combination is to die for !!! Yum yum ....my only gripe is lack of parking ."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Authentic and tasty. The ambiance is not fantastic, but this is reflected in the price point ($20 will leave two people very full). Overall, if you want inexpensive, very tasty Pakistani food and are not too fussy about appearance - this is your place."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time as a kid with my parents until I started having a mind of my own and realized how dirty the place is. If the tables are that horrid, can you imagine the back and people making your food?   I've had instances of finding hair in my food and the fact that the majority of it just soaking in oil is such a stomach turner.  My parents stopped eating here and I will never either."}
{"text":"Want authentic paki/indian food? This is the place! All of their dishes are delicious. I would definitely recommend my personal favourite, the lamb karahi! Its full of taste and spicy too. Along with their fresh naans, you will not be disappointed. The employees are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Terrific naan! The location and look of the place is not what you're paying for, it was delicious and not overpriced like Banjara.  The vegan Channa Masalah was spiced full and just right, and lots of other vegan options."}
{"text":"We love Pakistani/Indian food and nothing feels better than to treat ourselves with it on Friday night. After reading many good positive reviews for Makkah restaurant, I can only agree, as this indeed may be the best such restaurant in town. At least the five guys working there very hard. We were lucky to get a sampler of various veggie foods, before deciding, as one of us can't tolerate spice very well. You do not see that very often that the owner will offer you a sampler. So we had thumbs up even before ordering.  We got one veggie platter to share with four different veggies, rice and naan bread. Yes, it was unbelievable. It is so fresh, large and heavenly - perfect! All was nicely flavored and the veggies were delicious, no complaints whatsoever. With a jug of water it was a pleasure to get all that food down the throat. Just a little spicy for one of us :P but doable. Believe me :)  The location itself is as they usually are - nothing much and pretty bad-shape, but the washroom was nice and clean. Service was great and we left there very pleased. You can also pay by debit btw."}
{"text":"The decor isn't perfect, but the attentive (workaholic) staff makes up for it. They start making your food the moment you order it, and it's at your table the second it's done.   As others have mentioned, the naan is out of this world good. For some very satisfying food to go with your naan, try the Chicken Tikka Masala, Curries, or the Nihiri. Only spice haters will leave unsatisfied.   Really, truly great food."}
{"text":"Found a bug inside my rice plate. Was enough for my stomache. Didn't bother to try their food.  That itself is a no goer for me."}
{"text":"Really good Bihari kabob and chicken charga. The atmosphere might not be the nicest to sit in but I always to take out and have had amazing food.  They also take catering orders too. I feel like the quantity you get is a lot for what you pay."}
{"text":"Makah is home to decent naan and very cheap entrees. I had a leg of tandoori chicken and naan for 5.06$. Not a lot of meat but it came with a small spicy salad. Other times I've had the beef curry and it was bland but with a fresh naan to sop it up, it's still a good choice. Sometimes I'll just pop in for a naan to munch as I walk down danforth. The restaurant itself is plain and a little cluttered but reasonably clean. The staff is quiet but friendly. I've been going there for yen years and the quality and the prices have remained largely the same.  Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Possibly the best BBQ for bihari kebab in Canada.  Try the bihari kebab which is a super tender tenderloin meat BBQ in the tanoor. Comes with naan.   The rest of the food is very good, albeit VERY spicy and I am used to heat.  Ask for plain yogurt on the side to sooth the heat.  The place is a bit dirty on that the tables don't get cleaned often, sometimes the wait is unreasonable,but the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Makkah is still the one with the best tandoori chicken in my book.  As soon as you stop in front of the restaurant, you can see hard working men grilling their mouth-watering tandoori chicken and baking the naan.  Be prepare to get in line to order your food.  This place can be quite busy with take-out goers.  It is a cafeteria style.  Order what you want at the counter, find your seating at the back, carefully listen for your order and check at the counter often.  Then pay before you leave.    The service is great, friendly and helpful.  I go there for a good home-style and authentic cooking meal.  Everything is consistently delicious.  Superbly seasoned.  Generous size.  Of course, my absolute favorite is the char grilled tandoori chicken.  Each dark-meat piece is always juicy, flavorful and tender.  The tamarind-like dipping sauce was tangy with slight tartness, which gave it a wonderful contrast to the perfectly grilled chicken.  Rock on, Makkah, rock on!"}
{"text":"Decor deceives this place. Everything is super hot but super good. Beef shank and the lentils and a lassi and naan is all I need before I die!!"}
{"text":"Amazing kebabs this side of the world - the most authentic bihari kebabs, not greasy and touristy stuff they serve on Gerrard St. Their deserts are amazing too. Curries are ok, you really want to come here for the kebabs and tandoori chicken is good too. Friendly, decent service, dont be scared by the men with the long Muslim beards and caps :)"}
{"text":"Not good.    Ok the Naan was ok.   And the Daal was decent.     Everything else just didn't seem like it could be trusted.   Flavours were thin and weak as were the sauces.   The meats used were of port quality or past the best before date.    Overall unpleasant experience.   Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is not fancy at all! It's basically good to pick up Pakistani food! I had the kabob rolls (chicken and beef) they were delicious and large portions. Trust me, one portion (roll) is very filling. I had their butter chicken it was good too. They have many ready dishes, lots of variety such as fish and vegetarian options. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was busy at 6PM with people waiting to order and some waiting for pick up.   I ordered: Whole Tandoori Chicken (comes with 2 naans) \"Highlight\" Special - Bihari Kabob with one naan  Chicken Biryani ($6.50!!!!)   When we ordered, the cashier let us know that it would be a 30 minute wait. We said ok and left. Came back about 20 minutes later and it was ready! Came home and the naan was piping hot! The tandoori chicken was so good. Bihari kabob was also great - spicy too.   Chicken biryani tasted well seasoned (maybe boxed spices, not too sure). I would definitely order again! It was our first time going here.   When we went back, it was just as busy. The total bill came to $40 with taxes!! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Today again went and has a thali (combo) of fresh naan, dal, aloo gobi, and nihari. My first time having nihari, and I loved it! Braised beef shank in a rich ginger coriander broth. Lots of delicious sauce for the naan to soak up.  I can't believe no one else is reviewing this place!"}
{"text":"The one near Donlands is good but the one near VIctoria Park is nasty (stained walls, they don't wash their hands between cash and going back to handling coriander in the back). Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall.  I just randomly piced dishes that looked good. I think had the Curry Chicken and one of the Dhals. Both were good and super spicy."}
{"text":"Walking in for takeout about a year ago we we're not impressed and never going to order again. HOWEVER, received a flyer in the mail and decided to give them another chance and they fully redeemed themselves!! Ordered Dinner for Two and paid an extra $2-3 to make the curry a vindaloo. $30 Meal and we got 2 veg samosas with mint and tamarind chutney, 1 meat curry, veg of the day, 1 rice pulao and 2 fresh and fluffy naans!! Ordered delivery and it arrived before excepted. Food was piping HOT! Lamb Vindaloo was large tender chunks, potato was perfect and the portion was awesome!! Not greasy or oily at all as what I have seen in the other pics. Flavourful. Will ask for x-spicy tho next time. Think they are taking the reviews into consideration and implementing changes...or they did at least with our meal! Veg of the day was delish, cooked to perfection. I was expecting hard flat naans, but out came large fluffy and soft naans- perfect! And pulao was stardard basmati rice with peas.  Couldn't believe the amount of food we got for $30. Will definitely order delivery from them again."}
{"text":"4.0 for the restaurant. 5.5 for the earthquake.  I didn't specifically ask for it, but as I was chowing down this afternoon, I was treated with a nice earth shake to compliment my chana masala, aloo gobi and butter chicken all for $6.99 and I sopped up every bit of the goodness on my plate with the massive piece of naan they gave me.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's certainly not going to win any awards for decor, but you'd be a fool to walk by and not give Makkah a chance. In fact, I'd say that the food was on par with Lahore Tikka house, so give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Ordered off just-eat for pickup  I walked in and was not greeted by the first two people I saw, in fact I was completely ignored until a third guy came out and gave me my order   The food - greasy!!! I understand that I am not paying very much but damn, this was low quality and very little meat   It was edible other than grease and fatty cuts of beef   Naan bread was the highlight   The paneer dish was so watery it's like they didn't use and cream or yogurt , just water   All the dishes were watery except the butter chicken which was nice but has 6 chunks of chicken floating in it   Luckily I had left over BBQ meat I cut up and added to the dishes   I only came here because all the good Indian places didn't open till 5   I do not think I'd return here"}
{"text":"This is a take out joint. Do NOT come here with expectations of service. They are nice, but it's really not a nice place for dining in. It's pretty much a hole is the wall.   I am not a big fan of their curries... they are alright, but the BBQ/tandoori dishes are very good for the price. The taste may not be what you are used to from other Pakistani joints, and that could be due to the Bangladeshi influence. Very similar though.   I've never had anything delivered, so I can't comment on that. Pick up is probably thr best option."}
{"text":"My review is only based on their chicken biryani combo (with a tiny salad and a boiled egg).  The biryani was not good at all.  Very bland.  I could not detect any of the typical spices at all (ie. cardamom).  I asked them to make it extra spicy but the employee said it was spicy already.  There was absolutely no spice in the rice.  The salad, which comes in a tiny container that you would use for sauce, was actually far spicier than the biriyani.  The only saving grace was the fact that I paid $5 flat.  Had I paid anything more, I would've been quite angry!  The server who took my order was very friendly though.  I most likely will not go back as there are too many options for south Asian cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the eastern edge of Danforth. Not an inviting sit-down restaurant, but if you are in the neighborhood seeking some no-fuss, delicious South Asian take-out fare, this spot is for you. As others have stated, the fresh naan made before your eyes is pure heaven, a perfect complement to the tikka combos and other saucy offerings. My only small quib is the side salad that accompanies each meal, made up mostly of shredded iceberg lettuce and lots and lots of julienne onions. But the menu overall is of great value. Finally, they have forgotten things in past takeout orders, so be always to double-check your items to make sure everything is there."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the naan, so i stopped in for takeout. As others have noted, the place is ghetto. Pretty unappealing inside. Service wasn't rude but pretty unwelcoming and apathetic. The sauce for the chicken curry i ordered was OK but there was no chicken to be found--just a chicken bone (probably a neck bone). Not worth another try."}
{"text":"I went here late last year with two friends for dinner but got sick later that night.  I wanted to love this place.  I know it has its fans.  It was hard to decide so I played it safe with a vege combo option.  It was good.  Nothing special.  The value was mostly there.  At that point it was 3 stars.  Within several hours it was pretty obvious to me that I had food poisoning.  You can never prove these things but I am pretty sure I was able to trace it back to this restaurant.  I would be willing to give it another chance but will likely just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is terrible... I ordered take out and the Naak was not even covered fully with foil.. the butter chicken looked and tasted bad... never going there again. Service: 3/5(self-service) Quality:1/5 Quantity:3/5($) Overall, the food may be apt for Bangladeshi palate as its no where close to Indian/Pakistani taste.. I wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Went with a group so we tried a variety of dishes.   The naan is extremely fresh and made in store so it's a must try!   The BBQ chicken, tandoori chicken, chili chicken, and butter chicken were all cooked to perfection. Chili chicken especially came with excellent gravy.   Although the restaurant looks very simple, it was still a great eat and would definitely return. Price was also very reasonable for the amount of dishes and naan we ordered."}
{"text":"Restaurant itself is nothing special. More like a cafeteria style. However, the food was fantastic. Everything was delicious. Everything was very tender and Full of flavour. The naan was  huge and one of the best I've ever eaten. My favourite was the curry fish. Amazing."}
{"text":"This food - two of the veggie options - is the worst Indian food I have EVER had. The daal is honestly, just an opened can of lentils. The palak paneer has not GOT a flavour. What a huge disappointment. AVOID. STILL HUNGRY BUT DONT WANT IT."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian place in the east end that's not on Gerrard. The Chana masala is amazing as is the butter chicken. The shrimp vindaloo isn't worth the money though because you get about three shrimp in the dish. I mean, it's called SHRIMP vindaloo, right?   Those who are the least bit sensitive to spice should avoid and continue eating at Amaya instead, as this is REAL Indian food and it'll blow your nose off."}
{"text":"We ordered Makkah take-out (or rather delivery) from Just-Eat from Makkah. You must try this place out.  Totally recommend the Tandoori (we had the chicken) -- yummy.  We also had the lamb curry, rice, naan bread (fyi - the pieces are massive!), and the beef samosas (these were really great).  The food came in great time and they wrapped the containers in foil to keep them hot.  The food came in good time and there were \"no prisoners\" at the end. Lamb was tender and flavorful and the mango lassi's were great for putting out any \"fires\". So good !!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I normally get the shish kabab and the veggie thali as well as the chicken tikka with naan. It's GREAT! I would highly recommend. The veggie thali is SPICY!."}
{"text":"Makkah produces the tastiest, chewiest, most flavourful naan East of the Don Valley! Watching the naan being made by the window is intoxicating.   While the signage is dated and the construction around is off-putting, this is maybe the tastiest Pakistani/Indian food I've ever hard. Portions are large enough to feed 2 per dish, and their karahis (Pakistani stews) are top notch. I have a soft spot for the Lamb Karahi, and the spicy pain it causes me every time. For those sensitive to spice, ask to dial it back on dishes you're not sure if; they can really leave you crying, either for your mother, or for more.   If the ambiance and decor was a little bit nicer, Makkah would beat Lahore Tikka House by a mile, but thankfully because nobody seems care, it remains a nice gem in an otherwise increasingly gentrified East York neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Below average food. Have had better in so many places around Toronto. But yes, naans were amazing.  Otherwise everything else is sub par. Guy at the counter, I think the manager, isn't very friendly either. Place is really stuffy too."}
{"text":"I usually order take out here.  They have Chicken Briyani special every Tuesday for $4.50.  It usually have about two medium sized chicken (not enough chicken) with a lot of rice, so I usually order another dish to eat with the leftover rice. I tried their curry beef (a box of about 12-14 pieces of beef for $12), it was a bit chewy but tasted good."}
{"text":"Food is good but man service is damnnnnnnnnnn slow. It's happened to me twice now.  Once for take out. I called ahead and have them 30 and when I got there they took another 20 !!! And this time done-in and we everything we ordered were already prepared besides the naan so i don't understand why on earth they took so long. We waited 20 minutes for already prepared food. Ridiculous. We were the only family in the resteraunt and a few take out customers."}
{"text":"I believe this is the most authentic be gali food in toronto the community are majority bengali so it makes you feel like you are in Bangladesh. We had tehari and naam tehqru is like a spicy beef dish really good and tasty and the mago lassi is a little sweet and sour and is about ley delicious they do give quite a big portion if you have more people it becomes more enjoyable"}
{"text":"Firstly, I love the portion sizes. For the amount of money you pay, you get quite a lot of food.  Shrimp Curry ($9): Let me tell you, this dish is spicy! I have no problem with that, I actually love how spicy it is; the bell peppers really give it a kick. However, this dish is a little too salty (not a big deal to me) and I wish the shrimp were just a little more tender. I have only eaten shrimp curry at one other restaurant, thus I cannot really compare this dish to other ones. This didn't WOW me though.  Palak Paneer ($8): I have tasted better, this dish was quite average. Also, I wish there were more pieces of paneer (cheese) in it. It was still enjoyable though.  Butter Naan ($1.25 each): Holy moly! I did not expect the naan to be this big! At another restaurant, they charged $1.50 per naan (half the size of Makkah's naan) so I didn't expect this. The naan was also not too oily. The underside was quite burned at times though; eating burned food isn't very fun.  OVERALL: The food tasted average. I wasn't amazed by the dishes. They were still quite enjoyable, but I have definitely dined at better Indian restaurants. I am a very big fan of their portion sizes though. This was my first time eating food from Makkah, but I'm not too keen on coming back though."}
{"text":"Be careful you might just walk by.  Look for the large naan ovens in the window which are in constant motion based on the demand. Simple, fresh and tasty traditional Indian/Pakastani favorites.   TIPS:   Tikkas are great Get the naan Take it to go, this place does not have an ounce of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Looking for naan and some pretty tasty kabobs to go with? This is your place. This place is smokey from the naan ovens and smells like a giant BBQ. Which is what I want to see, just not come out smelling like. There is no real reason to stay and eat here unless you are making a pit stop. Check out the menus in the photo gallery and put a take out order. Note the spice levels, it can creep up. Medium spice has got some kick for the more western palette."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices, make no mistake this is not fast food. It is great authentic Indian/Pakistani food with a variety of menu items sure to please most.  Recommendations: Kabab Roll Chicken Tikka w/ Naan Chana Masala"}
{"text":"According to the sign, Makkah is the largest halal restaurant in Toronto. Not sure if that's true but they do make some damn good Pakistani/Indian eats.  For $5 with tax, I had a foot long kebab, a piece of naan, and a salad. The kebab is Turkish or Pakistani style, i.e. a long tubular piece of ground beef cooked in the tandoor not chunks of grilled meat like you'd get at a Greek place. It was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The naan was also excellent, a bit thicker than most Indian places with a crisp outer shell and moist and fluffy interior.  The large sit down area at the back is dingy and has zero atmosphere. But that's pretty much to be expected and doesn't bother me. A great cheap lunch option if you find yourself on this desolate stretch of the Danforth."}
{"text":"Places like Makkah perpetuate the stereotype that food from the sub continent can only be greasy, spicy and heavy handed.  Makkah does a decent enough kebab: juicy and flavorful. Heaven forbid you order vegetarian curry: tasteless and chances are pretty old, since no one seems to order their veggies.  It's a one-curry-fits-all kinda place and grimy as hell."}
{"text":"A gem in plan sight ! Delicious and filling. Don't let the outside fool you, it's a great price and great value."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience yesterday 13th sept 2015 at this restaurant.  First i asked for Chicken biryani and the cashier said they have run out of chicken biryani which is supposed to be inexpensive.. he went on to suggest me lamb biryani instead as it is pricey.  To my surprise after we ordered and sat down to get our order, the same cashier took the order for Chicken biryani to another person .. wow !! I was left speechless   The place is messy and decor sucks !!"}
{"text":"Best daal ever (very spicy and earthy), excellent chili chicken, good curry beef, good saag paneer, very good, but not very spicy butter chicken. Oh, and fluffy naan done in tandoor, actually everything that comes out I the tandoor is pretty amazing!  I always get delivery, and order way too much so I have lunches made for the week.  Pakoras! Get them too.  YUM. (But need to be reheated in oven to bring them back to pre-delivery perfect crispness)"}
{"text":"My roommate discovered this gem through skip-the-dishes. Tip: the restaurant actually offers FREE delivery between 4pm and 11pm if you order from them! The food was amazing! We had the tandoori chicken wings and the meat samosas. They were phenomenal! Today I visited the restaurant in person and ordered a feast for tonight. The kebabs look soooo good. Can't wait to try them."}
{"text":"I have NEVER eaten such terrible Indian/Pakistani food. EVER. My husband and I were so disgusted the last time I ordered from there that we tasted it, ate a few bites and chose too dump it in the trash. The lamb curry was a misery of oil, water and burnt spices. It was acrid. The chapati (home made style roti) was so terrible and had a strange colour. The daal was disgusting--and really, how can you make a daal disgusting. The simplest of spices and it tastes royal. What did they do to it?  Delivery: don't even ask. First time I ordered some kebabs and two hours later I find out their driver delivered it to the wrong address. The next time I ordered (the shitty lamb curry, daal and chapati), they gave me someone else's food (marked with my address--different items). I ran after the driver and he realized the restaurant made a packaging error. How can you do this twice in a row to the same customer?  The only good thing here is their beef tikka and seekh kebab, and for that I gave them the two stars. Really if these weren't so good, they deserve negative stars for the most acrid and foul food and curries on the entire planet."}
{"text":"I would never ever going in Makkah Restaurant by myself if my fellow yelper did not take me here!!  Makkah Restaurant is full of men... all the men that works in the kitchen...all the men that was ordering the food or eating the food in here..  I really stood out like a sore thumb...   The self served eat in area is clean and spacious... after you placed your order, you picked up your food and then you eat and after that you pay... All based on honour system since you even help yourself with the drinks from the fridge!!  Chicken Tikka Kebab was so tender, juicy and delicious! And love that charred smokey flavoured!!   Naan bread that is freshly made by those friendly kitchen staffs that even posed for my photo shots with a big smile on their faces!!  Just love Makkah Restaurant for their food, their down to earth vibe and friendly service!  Now maybe I am ready to come back on my own now???"}
{"text":"The good: This place is classic. The prices are cheap. The food is essentially greasy and good Pakistani fast food.  The bad: It's so ghetto.  The ugly: Parking in this area is tough sometimes."}
{"text":"Got some takeout from Makkah. Everything was okay, but most items were not particularly tasty.  Bihari kabob was flavourful and tender.  Naan was good.  Also tried a thali combo with 1 meat, 2 veg: Chicken tikka was fine, but nothing special. Dal was so-so, not particularly flavourful & had a sludgy texture. Mixed vegetables were not exceptional, but nice enough. Salad was standard and uninspired. Rice was standard.  If I was close by and needed food, I might or might not try Makkah again. I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  2.5 stars"}
