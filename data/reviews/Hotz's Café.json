{"text":"Hotz's cafe is one of my new favorite hangouts in Tremont.  Very cool old bar, friendly service and great prices.  I like the crowd - all types of people hang out there.  Cool place!"}
{"text":"i like the people at hotz's.  they are really nice.   this is the type of bar where everyone knows everyone, and there's really a sense of community.  a community of beer drinking, good time-having, fun people.  and hey- i guess that even includes the dude that came up to my friends and myself on my birthday that was the most entertaining drunk dude ever, i think."}
{"text":"Into her 80s, Mrs. Hotz still holds court here every Saturday night. After her telling of her husband's passing in the 1990's and how she has ran the bar ever since, I thought I was complimenting her, \"You're quite the entrepreneur.\" She saw right through my bs and asked, \"Are you calling me some sort of whore?!\" I love this woman, maybe even more than her 100yr old bar. If you want to feel a part of Cleveland's history, come to Hotz.  It has bar shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Love me a good dive bar.  And nothing says dive bar like potato chips sold on hanging clips and pretzel rods to munch on.  The regulars look like they came with the building and they probably have a liver to prove it.  This is definitely a beer-and-a-shot bar.  Want a glass of wine?  Bad idea.  The only option you have is Livingston Cellars that was probably opened and last poured a few months ago.  Stick to beers or hard grain.  Spacious bar, which I dig.  I don't need some drunk ass leaning into me.  If I could wave a magic wand and change one thing?  The height of the bar stools!  They are not the proper height for the bar, thus making it difficult to rest your arms on the bar and get comfortable.  Great jukebox.  Great, homey feel when people bring in food to share."}
{"text":"I like my bars simple.  No overpowering music.  No uptight bartenders.  Not packed to the brim full of people.  Hotz is perfect.  No frills whatsoever.  Limited election because of it, but when you can but three drinks for about 10 bucks, you can't really do wrong.  For those of us who aren't beer drinkers (like me), you might not get all of the options you'd like.  I think i confused the bartender when I ordered a screwdriver.  I think 99% off people who come here order a Budweiser.  That being said, my screwdriver was damn strong when I did eventually receive it.  Best part?  They have shuffleboard.  Cheap drinks and free games?  Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Probably the coolest bar in Tremont - because it's not the cool place to be.   Sure, beer selection is lacking (domestics only) and they don't offer the finest wines -- but what they do offer is a really comfortable neighborhood type of place to hang out. Free pizza sitting on the bar, shuffleboard, nice people to talk to.  Mrs. Hotz, the owner, was there Saturday night. She is the cutest and sweetest little lady you'll ever want to meet. Reminded me of my grandma -- except my grandma would never utter the word \"whore\" (and she was NOT talking about ME, thank you very much!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite dive spot in Tremont.  There's nothing fancy about this joint--it doesn't have a huge beer list, there's no crazy cocktail/martini menu, and you won't find some sort of gastropub food.  This is one of those neighborhood bars where you go to play shuffleboard, jam on the juke, drink cheap, and converse with anyone and everyone.  It's very welcoming and even the owner is awesome.  Mrs. H. is hilarious and sweet all at the same time.  It's not hipster, it's not pretentious, it's not a baller club, it's just a great little bar that's been around for a hundred years and, hopefully, it doesn't go anywhere."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome low key bar. A few minute walk from the more popular spots in Tremont but its worth it. It's not the nicest looking for most lavish, but its a fun environment to hang out and play.   I've been here several times and it has been enjoyable. Drinks are cheap but well made. Many top shelf liquor to choose from as well as cheap domestic beers. There isn't food here, but they do sell a variety of chips/snacks. The chips are great to munch on after a few drinks.   You can play shuffle board and use the jukebox to play your favorite tunes or take a group selfie (both are pay to play). As always compete in a game of shuffle board with your friends (or strangers) and of course the losers pay for drinks!   This place is right in the middle of the \"cheap fast & good\" venn diagram!"}
{"text":"Considering the type of atmosphere all the bars and restaurants  in Tremont have this place is a breath of fresh air--if you like your air to be straight up casual with no frills. It's a small dive bar with cheap drinks (my favorite), beer by the bottle only, shuffle board, and a juke box.   My kind of spot. All the patrons are fun friendly people and so are the bartenders."}
{"text":"I love Hotz.  It has been family owned since 1919 and the service, warmth and family pride show in every visit.  It is a textbook \"neighborhood bar\" where you feel comfortable. The family that owns it are warm welcoming and professional.  It also has the added element of surprise from the eclectic Tremont crowd, loyal customers and aspiring artists on open mike night (every other Tuesday).  If you have never been to Hotz's give it a try.  You will have a great time.  I always do."}
{"text":"Tremont neighborhoody hangout. It's low-key, not busy, and they have a fun bowling arcade game. It's kind of a funky little place, not really fancy or anything special. It's kind of run-down from the looks of the outside. They play hip tunes while you sip on your booze and hang out.   Definitely a dive bar if that's what you're in the mood for. :)"}
{"text":"This place reeks of nostalgia. Established in 1919 and passed among 4 generations of Hotz's. If the walls could talk, they'd probably have plenty of stories to tell.  According to current bar owner Mrs. Hotz, Babe Ruth, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the cast from The Deer Hunter including Robert DeNiro have all visited Hotz. I was told that the check Babe Ruth wrote to buy a round for  the entire bar was never cashed, but saved to help preserve the story. FDR's portrait hangs above the mens restroom, clearly a sign of the highest respect. I'm not sure what DeNiro left with his visit, but I can only imagine the long time regulars could vouch for his appearance as well.  Unpretentious customers, friendly service and a no frills drink menu, Hotz is a neighborhood bar that hasn't been around for over 91 years by accident. Patience, discipline, strength, dedication and survivorship skills were all needed for this place to remain. I can't wait to be there in person to help celebrate Hotz's 100th anniversary.   Cheers to the Hotz family. You've done good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a drink in Cleveland. The Hotz family puts the \"H\" in hospitality. They are closed on Sunday and Monday when most of Tremont is quiet. Cheap drinks, good conversation and the beer keeps flowing.  Carry on Hotz!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh Love me some Hotz.  Great family.  Been coming here for years.  Its nice when they ya still can walk into a Tremont bar and people still know your name and what ya drink.  This is one of the few low-key original Tremont bars.  At night it can get a little wiggerish with young kids...be ready to hear every top 40 rap song on the jukebox.  Biggity Bam!  You will also have your occasional hipster, trendy couple coming for a drink after dropping 100 bux on dinner at one of the restaurants or trying to show friends from out of town \"the real Tremont\".  They have kinda goofy hours, this place does... .but keeps us on our toes.  Great happy hour.  If one of the old neighborhood guys wants to play ya in shuffleboard for a beer...be ready to buy him a beer.  These guys will school your ass!  This is their home turf...  Hope to see ya up there...tell em Large Marge sent ya!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to get cheap drinks, then this is the spot. Just be aware of drunken people getting into fights."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood bar in tremont. Nothing fancy"}
{"text":"Literally stumbled upon this awesome family owned, neighborhood bar. What a welcome from a long, tiring day. Incredibly friendly family staff (Katie) made us feel right at home as soon as we came through the front door. Fun conversation about the history of the business and the ghosts. Stopped in for a beer and came back later for open mic night, which we highly recommend for a fun night out. And they have a shuffle board table! Thank you for a night much needed Katie! See you in a couple of months!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, seems to be an older crowd, kind of a dive but great craft beer at a reasonable price. Just don't go inside expecting much to look at."}
{"text":"Hotz is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood.  Great place to start out the night, go for a night cap, or forget your other plans and just stay all night.  The girls working always make you feel at home.  The history is just as splendid as the grooves in the shuffleboard table.  Definitely a place where you can sit down and make yourself a friend."}
{"text":"I buried my hatchets, made my amends and moved back down to Tremont. Hotz's is a great place to relax and have some cheap drinks while staying away from the crowds."}
{"text":"Taco Thursday?  Count me in!  Well sorta...I kinda didn't know that and had eaten a taco for lunch BUT know that I know they have Tacos on Thursdays, you can count me in for a future date!  Hotz is a local \"old timey\" kinda of bar in Tremont.  There is bar shuffle-board and the beer is cheap enough to keep you entertained for a while.  It's well maintained and probably looks fairly similar to when it opened in the early 1900's.    I wasn't a huge fan of the blaring Katy Perry reverberating off their polished mahogany walls.  It's me just being picky but it just didn't seem like that kind of a bar?  Put on some Tom Waits or heck, RUSH would be better.  Katy Perry?  Ugh, that's what I'm trying to get away from!    No worries though, I'm still coming back for Taco Thursday."}
{"text":"i love hotz, my favorite bar to go to on Thursday and Saturday. haven't been in a while do to funds but its a great place. end everyone has a story to tell!!!"}
