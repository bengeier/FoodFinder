{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. 

As soon as I walked in I noticed heat lamp-ed trays of rice and what looked to be deep fried fish, chicken, and shrimp. There were many other things various unknown deep fried snacks and treats as well. There was no menu in sight aside from the labelled pictures on the outside window (which consisted of, yup you guessed it, fish, chicken, and shrimp) so I just figured I'd try their chicken biriyani. 

It was 6.50 for one of those massive takeout containers and I ended up with a whole lotta rice (spiced with various vegetables and herbs), a hunk of deep fried chicken (not a lot of meat to it), a minuscule amount of... salad? (Tiny portion of cold onions and lettuce in a white dressing of some sort), and a small container of curry chicken.

It was toooo much food for me though. Granted, a lot of it was rice but still. At least it was decently spiced. I'm willing to go back to try some more things when I got some time. There was a good amount of people coming and going when I went so that is a decent sign of food turnover anyway."}
{"text":"Average Tamil spicy food... Their various - beef, mutton/goat, fish Lamprais is good. 

Lamprais is a pack of boiled rice (brown/white) with a special curries (at least 5+ variety), accompanied by fish and egg, all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked."}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken kothu rotis, went home and realized they gave 2 very dry MUTTON kothu rotis. Called to tell them about this and staff sounded careless then hung up on me. 
Very poor service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"i got my moneys worth comming here, And i love it spicy everything was spicy and it felt like good srilankan food, not amazing but good :) I recomend lampras or chicken buriyani for the spice hunters or try mutton/chicken kothuroti (pronounced just like it's spelt) GO FOR A FLAVOUR ADVENTURE HERE :) AND BRING A FRIEND, YOU MAY NOT FINSH ALLOF YOUR GIANT TAKE OUT BOX (y)

not you can't eat inside here, this place is mainly take out, for those nights you dont want to cook :)"}
{"text":"It's a takeout place only, not a place to sit and eat. But the food tastes amazing and is well priced.

I would recommend that you go in person and order, they are very quick at preparing the food."}
{"text":"Just called in an order and was told they can't take my order. Very rude on the phone."}
{"text":"The younger staff behind the counter probably remembered me as he came over to my end of the counter to greet me. I'm pretty easy to remember as I'm probably the only Chinese to step inside the TAKE-OUT Sri Lankan shop within the last Month or two. I was there the last time pointing my ass off at the photos outside but it was after 3 pm, which is when they stop serving the Lamprais that they display in photos along the outside of the store.

I asked him what was good and he said Biryani(Fried Rice) but I was still Lamprais-oriented so I asked for the Chicken Lamprais and waited on the side in this typical Sri Lankan Take-out setup(i.e. Babu). There was no Menu or Menu-boards available so just go in be adventurous and start asking or bring a friend of Sri Lankan/Indian origins. 

Chicken Lamprais($7.50) came out in a plastic bag and must have weighed 2lbs and not something you can eat in the car unless you're ready to make a mess with your right(!) hand and give your car that new Curry perfume! Unwrap the Newspaper, Butcher Paper, Banana Leaf to discover the mother-load. 

I'm sure if you're a Yelp Toronto user, you'll know about Hopper Hut Lamprais so I won't go indepth. As my comparison to HH Lamprais, this one when opened had more distinct segregation of each Curry element which is nice to see instead of making educated guesses. What I didn't like as much was that the whole dish tasted a bit wet/loose possibly the Curries wasn't as evaporated, maybe the Rice was just cooked and steam did it in?

LOL, my mother while eating...  \"Spicy, spicy, spicy, spicy....\""}
{"text":"Have been going here for years, had not been there for a while, were in the area, and decided to go in today go in for some of our favourite take outs.  Their kothu rotti is good here and they have a nice assortment of vegetarian sides.  Their mutton rolls, fish patties and fish BUNS are amazing.  There is nothing unflavourful in this place.  They crank out tons of amazing Sri Lankan food.  You can ask for the spicing to be mild, medium or hot - and hot is very hot.  Place is always busy."}
{"text":"Awesome Tamil food...spicy and satisfying!!!!large portions too!!! Plus cheap...all a guy can ask for!!! Had the vadda, mutton roll and parrotta with tamil mutton curry...it was awesome...."}
{"text":"Spicy somosas, Great Singapore style noodles , pakora.... The rice with fish wrapped in banana leaf is  7$ for enough food to feed four people....SO SPICY - SO GOOD. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The verdict for the chicken lamprais from Abbirami Catering: Spicy!! 

After sharing that huge lamprais for lunch with 2 other yelpers... I am satisfied and happy.. eating spicy food makes my tummy feels nice and burning warm. 

So much different flavours in this little bundle of joy, I saw my friend eager tasted different colourful portion of lamprais and guessing what they were and enjoying the different sensation of spiciness. 

If you are like me, enjoy spicy and intensive flavours that will knock your socks off.. you will love that!!
