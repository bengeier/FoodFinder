{"text":"Excellent meal! The service was very personable and professional. Our entree's were prepared quickly and came to our table steaming hot! Check this place out if you live here or are just passing through town like we were. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The flavors, the spices...it's so incredibly delicious! Peruvian cuisine is so tasty. My gf got the mixed meat rice dish and I got the seco de carne... Both were huge portions and every bite was perfection. The green sauce they make is addictive - spicy, garlicky, and all goodness. The prices are totally good & we had our leftovers for breakfast the next day!! Totally coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty good peruvian food. Kinda on the pricy side. But still good. Only negative thing I can say is ... Shame on you for using white onions!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and cook to order. I take my family there at least once a month.   Our favorites are aguadito de pollo, chaufa de pollo, suprema de pollo and platano frito.  My least favorite was the peruvian ceviche, too raw for my taste; the waiter saw my discontent with this item  and offered a replacement.   Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"My 3 men are all camping and I wanted to try something new for my quiet dinner  :-)  After reading reviews I called for take out! I ordered the Pollo Saltado with Tacu Tacu and a Chicha Morada to swish it all down. (See photo)   When I walked in I was instantly relaxed by warm tones all around and soothing yet playful music! Staff greeted with eye contact & smiles (love that!) $22 later my tastebuds were ready to be transported to Peru!  Driving home I started sipping on the chicha...distinct,  fresh, totally like it!  The tacu tacu had great flavor, was dense but not mushy.  The saltado was made up of onions,  peppers,  chicken, cilantro,  beans? and all smothered in a thin & richly flavored sauce. Nommy nom nom, big enough for 2! Go & try it, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  My husband I are always up for new experiences for food.  We stumbled across this place and love the Peruvian food.  The service was great the pricing was moderate.  Beef Hearts were incredible.  There canned Peruviab Cola tastes like bubble gum.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent service-Antonio is the best  Services. Place is clean, bathroom clean n cool instrumental music plays to soothe the soul! Food is authentic and classic Peruian! Great food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but OH MY LARD was it SLOOOOWW. This was on mother's day 2013 and the place was full and there was 1 server, 1 busser, and I bet 1 cook. We were there 2 hours! :( The server was nice and felt bad and gave us this dried up homany looking thing while we waited an hour for our food. At least when the food finally came it was good. But we will not return, which is too bad because we live close to here."}
{"text":"Went a year ago for dinner and was not impressed.  Went back today for lunch.  Incredibly slow service with minimal customers.  Prices are high for the product.  Food satisfactory but not great.  Sign above set of doors says must always be open during business hours but 3/4 exit doors locked.  Major fire violation.  Owner not present and it is apparent."}
{"text":"So a group of friends and I decided to try this place after we had a craving for something different. Of course I turned to Yelp to see what Peruvian places there were here in Vegas. There were only 3 places so we decided to try this one.   This place is right off Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. When you walk in you almost feel like you're in mama's kitchen, well if you come from a latin background you would know what I'm talking about. Overall a very cozy atmosphere and not alot of traffic.  Now let's get down to business - food! We order a few dishes to get a taste and to make a fair judgement. First up, yuquitas fritas (deep fried yucca root). Actually I was expecting this to be either bitter or very stringy. Instead it tasted like a steak fry! A ranch style sauce accommodated this dish but the server brought out this cilantro mustard sauce that was better than the sauce it came with. Ask for the cilantro mustard sauce!  We then ordered the ceviche and anticuchos combo. The ceviche was incredible. I couldn't tell you what white fish it was but tasted like tuna. It had the perfect amount of flavor with the lime juice, cilantro and onions. It was served with potatoes (yams), dried corn (like oversized popcorn kernels), and corn.   The anticuchos were awesome! The anticucho combo included beef, chicken & beef heart and fried potatoes. Each of these meats just melted in your mouth and the peruvian spices on it were perfect! I thought the best one was the heart. I highly recommend the anticuchos. Also use the cilantro mustard sauce if you need a sauce on your skewer and potatoes.  Final dish was the Jalea Mi Peru seafood combo. It was a deep fried seafood mystery because you didn't know what type of seafood you were eating. But that didn't stop me from gnawing down the deep fried goodness. I was surprised how big this dish was and how it never seemed to end even as 4 of us tackled this mound of seafood delights. It was topped with an onion type pico de gallo and lime juice. Actually it was really good, even for trying to guess what exactly you were eating. This dish included: green mussels, scallops, shrimp and a white fish. I didn't see the tartar sauce it was suppose to come with but it doesn't matter I stuck to my cilantro mustard sauce and I was happy!   Overall the anticuchos are worth a try along with a nice ice cold Peruvian beer. It is a little pricey but the portion size does make up for how much you're spending. Service was great until the end when we were just sitting there waiting for our check. It's like the whole kitchen & staff disappeared for 20 mins. That's the only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. I was quite impressed by this place."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service by waiter \"Rosalba\". I went in with my family for pollo a la brasa and wished we had gone somewhere else. First of all, Rosalba said they did not have pollo a la brasa and recommended that we try a different Peruvian restaurant. Huh? Why would you try to encourage your customers to go somewhere else? Obviously, Rosalba must not have felt like working. Every time we asked for something, she gave us an attitude. Very sad way to treat the customers.  Next, I asked for one of their domestic beers. Again, Rosalba said they did not have any domestic beers but \"Cristal.\" So if you don't have pollo a la brasa or domestic beers, then don't put it on your menu!  We were very disappointed with the service so we decided we were not going to give a tip, little did we know Rosalba charged an 18% gratuity tip for a group of 5 adults. What?! Usually gratuity tips are for 6 or more. Rather than argue, we left and decided to never come back. Instead, I'm letting you know what to expect.  It's really such a shame for a restaurant to hire employees that make the restaurant look bad and discourage customers from wanting to come back. You have been warned."}
{"text":"*** Regionally Adjusted Rating ***  I did an extended weekend trip to Vegas with my Peruvian girlfriend and we are always on the lookout for good foods.  We did our homework before our getaway and wanted to try this place out since it has favorable ratings.    We jump in the car from our LV Strip Hotel and head over to Henderson in 100+ degree weather.  Not the ideal time to eat Peruvian food, but....  The restaurant is located in a shopping center which was easily accessible with ample parking.  What did we order here?  I am addicted to Lomo Saltado from the first time I had it in a \"whole in the wall\" in Downey.  I will order my Lomo Saltado, oh lomo why can't I quit you.  My girlfriend orders Tacu Tacu con Lomo Fino.  She has spoke about Tacu Tacu over and over again to me and we have been unable to find it at local LA/OC restaurants.  I hear about the \"good ole days\" in Peru.    So, how do I rate these.  Mind you I have never had the originals in Peru.  The Lomo Saltado was a 2 to 3 star.  It was okay, would I order it again if I went to Mi Peru, No.  The Tacu Tacu was  delicious even though Miss Peru said otherwise.  I would give the Tacu Tacu a 3 to 4 star rating.  I would definitely order that again.  All the price points were good.  Make sure to score a Inca Kola.  Overall rating adjusted for Las Vegas area would be a 3 star.  If it was here in LA/OC with the various Peruvian restaurant competition it would get a 2 star."}
{"text":"Went to eat there this evening and was shocked to see the entire place empty after reading rave reviews! I ordered the green mussels to start which tastes ok, I mean they were stuck to the shell and the excess garnish was a bit much. Then came that famous pollo! I was shocked because it didn't taste flavorful at all but more like they had cooked it with pork! Fried plantains were alright I think overall the french fries were the highlight. A small group showed on the way out and a single guy. Im not going to go there again , not worth +$45."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Great food. Awesome portions and excellent staff. We will be back very very soon."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Today ordered arroz con pollo. Very delicious. And chicha is good as always"}
{"text":"So I ate here one time with a group of my friends who had just returned from a trip to Peru.  I had their chicken fried rice, which was tasty, and it looked good, and it was really quite fine, but nothing spectacular.  The server was very nice and split our bill up for us which was nice since it was a group of 10.  He didn't even add gratuity on which was kind of surprising, although of the pleasant variety.  My friends all enjoyed their meals, and the arroz con pollo my friend had looked and smelled good too.  On the whole, I was happy with the meal and the service, but I doubt I'll be back here any time soon unless I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"After living two years in Peru, I always like scouting out Peruvian restaurants wherever i travel. This place was one of the best and most authentic i have tried. We are going back. We have tried the Tallarines Verdes, Aji de Gallina, Bistec a lo Pobre, and the Causa and it was all delicious"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there yesterday 1/10/13. We had our reservations about the place due to the lack of activity around the restaurant and the handful of tables occupied. However the waiter/host/server turned everything around in terms of service and attitude.  The food is priced slightly above average, but as the others described in here, well worth every penny and then some.  The chicken and beef kabobs were extraordinary. Even the regular chicken fried rice was delicious, fresh and flavorful.  The wine was fresh and perfectly matched with the meals. Good service and great food. Don't let the price scare you, the food quantities and quality more than make up for it.  Needless to say, i will go here again and again."}
{"text":"This establishment has amazing Peruvian food! Their stuff is always fresh, well seasoned, and very authentic. I would recommend the lomo salteado and ceviche. My mouth waters just thinking about it. A bit pricey but you get amazing Peruvian food which is hard to come by in this town."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my husband.  We were the only patrons. Patient and friendly waiter.  Paid 65$ not including tip which included 2 main dishes, side of beans, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine. Taste was just ok, not worth 65$. Wouldn't  go there again.  We ordered a dish above your \"daily  specials\" that had no price documented on the menu(23$) and a fish fillet. I recommend that you disclose dish prices on the menu or put \"fair market value \". Placing a picture of a dish above your daily special menu is misleading to the consumer."}
{"text":"12/27/15 My first experience with Peruvian food.  I was apprehensive because the parking lot was empty, the restaurant was not crowded, and the waiter did not seem friendly but it turned out to be a nice dinner with friends and good food.  The restaurant had other customers but it was not noisy and allowed us to have a quiet dinner with friends.  There was only one waiter (not very friendly) he was patient, efficient and took care of us.  I read the Yelp reviews and decided to order the Lomo Saltado (Tender beef strips sauteed w/tomatoes  &  onion,  garnished w french fries & rice $15.95), it was delicious.  The rice tastes like the jasmine rice in fancy Chinese restaurants, the meat was tender and delicious, the gravy from the food was so good on the fries and rice.  I tried a bite of my friends food and that was good.  There was these big corn kernels that I thought was bland and too starchy on my friends plate, note to self, don't get that.  I would have Peruvian food again.    They give appetizers, looks and taste like big corn nuts, it was good.  They also provide a green sauce called \"Aji\" I can't figure out what it is for since the foods are delicious as is."}
{"text":"Great Peruvian food, the Ceviche, Lomo Saltado and Anticuchos were very good.  If you want to try Peruvian food in Vegas check this place out."}
{"text":"I was excited when a group of friends chose to meet at Mi Peru for dinner. The food and service didn't let us down.  I had the anticucho combo - skewers with chicken or beef. The marinade was wonderful, and they were served hot from the grill. I saved some of the aji sauce for the meat, and it complemented the meat well.  The Lomo Saltado was a very popular dish at the long table, and I'm looking forward to try that next time.  Try the Inka Cola! You'll thank me."}
{"text":"ohh God this food is awesome!! this restaurant is totally the best peruvian restaurant in vegas!!, in Nevada!! i tried lomo saltado, my favorite dish, it tasted like heaven, since I moved from california, I've been searching for a really good peruvian restaurant, thanks God I found u guys."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Henderson!!! This is one of my favorite local restaurants!!! Prices aren't the cheapest but is reasonable and well worth it in my opinion. The food and the service are superb. Dinner for two averages around $60. With that being said, we leave with happy stomachs and some leftovers for the next day. Fish ceviche as an appetizer is a must whenever we go!!!! Seco de carne and beef with peso spaghetti are some of our staples. The meats are cooked so tender and fish dishes taste fresh!! There is also something to be said about their great service. Every time we eat here we are overwhelmed with Antonio's great customer service. He gives great recommendations with the menu, has an outstanding memory, and is very personable. I have enjoyed exploring and eating Peruvian cuisine thanks to this restaurant. Their flavorful dishes and great service keep us coming back for more! :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing! A bit pricey but I you can't find this food just anywhere, unless you are in Peru! :)"}
{"text":"This food warms my soul....and I'm from the Midwest!   So delicious.   The ceviche was amazing. Who knew that serving it with a room temperature potato and yam would be such a delectable combo.   Our entrees were amazing, as well.   Ask for the special green sauce,  it's amazing over the rice.     Save room for the coconut flan. We are already planning our next visit to Mi Peru."}
{"text":"good peruvian food.  granted i've only tried a few places, but my bf is peruvian and we both agreed this place was legit!  we ordered the arroz con pollo (chicken and seasoned rice) and the anticucho de lomo (beef kabobs with sides).... two popular peruvian dishes.  both were yummy.  i really liked the peruvian rice... and the kabobs were very tender and tasty!!  it's worth the drive and experience.  on the flip side, i did feel the dishes were a bit pricey for what they were.  however, i realize peruvian food is hard to come by here....  thus, rarity comes with a price."}
{"text":"Great food.  I have never had Peruvian food before, but had seen the restaurant frequently.  Came in on a Sunday afternoon and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Mother's day 2013. I've been to the Mi Peru several times and the food has always been amazing. So I was looking forward to a great mother's day brunch. We were a party of 12 and immediately were approved by the server apologizing for being the only server on the floor because the  other server that was supposed to be on called in sick. This poor server was the only one on the floor, no busser, no manager and of course no owner. This poor girl was buried beyond belief.  I've been in the restaurant business for years I felt incredibly sorry and helpless for the server, after 30 minutes sitting there and seeing what she was going through I thought the best thing for everyone including the server was for us to leave. When I told the server we were leaving tears weld up in her eyes, I gave her a fist full of cash and told her it wasn't her fault.  I hope management commends the server for putting up with the utter incompetence of management and ownership of Mi Peru."}
{"text":"Great service! The waiter recommended our meals (amazing). I suggest trying the Ceviche de Pescado which was the best ceviche I have tried."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Peruvian spot in town. Bold flavors, great portion sizes and courteous service makes this a must go. I love coming here when work brings me to this area of town. Lomo saltado and the tallarines verde con carne are some of my favs thus far. Lastly drizzle that hella spicy green sauce everywhere mmmmm"}
{"text":"A while back I bought a Groupon for Mi Peru because I've never tried Peruvian food before.  And boy am I glad I did!  This place is homey and quaint but don't let that fool you, their food is superb.  I tried the deep fried yucca root, which ended up tasting pretty close to a french fry, and their house specialty Seco de Carne- a pot roast type of dish that was absolutely delicious!  My parents both enjoyed their meals fully, each of them tried a different type of kabob.  I will definitely be heading back soon to try out their other specialties!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Try the anticuchos; you won't be sorry! They even have Peruvian beer and wine.  If you haven't experienced Peruvian food, this is a place to try.  I love the anticuchos so much that I have trouble trying anything else on the menu, but do often get to taste what others at my table order.  The green mussels are wonderful too.  If you want a typical Peruvian soft drink, try the chicha morada (there is a hard version, but this will give you a good taste for it).    Please try Mi Peru -- we need the good, neighborhood restaurants like this to survive!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner at Mi Peru.  The food came quickly and was very easy to share, family style.  We had ceviche, soup, fried yucca, and rotisserie chicken, along with the sweet corn drink.  All was delicious.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food. It seems overpriced, but you get more than 1 full meal on your plate. If you box it up, you have at least a snack or more for later. The lomo soltado was good. The pork was a bit dry. Service was good, but there was only one other table."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Wonderful service and delicious food. You have to try the Ceviche de Camarón. Worth every penny!  This was the simply the best!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Mi Peru for at least 7 years. It is one of our favorite restaurants. We always get the Papa la Huancaina and Lomo Saltado. The service is always great and the food is so delicious. Papa la huancaina is a dish with boiled potatoes covered in an amazing aji pepper sauce but it isn't spicy. The lomo is a marinated strip steak served over potato fries and rice with a beef based broth. Everyone should try this place and share with their friends. It's the best Peruvian food in town!"}
{"text":"From all the guests at my table - everyone had the same feedback --- this place is absolutely amazing!!! Everything from service, to cleanliness, to the most important thing of all ~ the food!!! --- I can't say how great this place was and I wish it just was closer to where I live at home!!! Thank you again and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch here. We had the lomo saltado and fish poached in tomato and white wine and a side of plantains. Everything was well done and tasty."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was good. Empty, but good. Had cevice pescador, fresh fish and large portion. Service was good as it should have been after all, I was the only one there."}
{"text":"Amazeballs Ceviche! We'll be going back especially for the ceviche.   Beware of the prices... The beer and wine prices (at least the Peruvian) weren't on the menu, not that that was the only factor to the price. But with tip out bill was over $100 for two entree's, 1 beer, 2 wines and the ceviche... didn't see that coming.   We've driven past this place too many times to count but finally tried it. Very glad we did but we didn't see the check coming in so high. Beyond that the food was great! We were the only people in there at 6pm on week night. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Mi Peru is in a obscure strip mall..  I stumbled upon the restaurant looking for something different.   Little did I know that Peruvian food also entails a lot of Chinese inspired dishes because there are a lot of Chinese people who live in Peru. This information was told to me by the owner himself...   My friend got the fried rice (Chinese dish) and I got a hearty chicken soup.  The fried rice was a bit too oily, but the soup was yummy. It tasted fresh and the flavors were right on.   I wouldn't mind coming out here again if I were in this part of town."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem.  Good food, good service.  Clean, neat and tidy.  Reasonably priced.  wish I could say exactly what we ordered, but I had a chicken dish, the hubby had a beef dish ~ they were both good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This South American grill has all the right stuff! Wow, what a genuine Peruvian experience with quality food, fair prices, and top notch service!!   Our server Antonio knows how to provide service. He was attentive to details, knowledgeable about the food/menu and culture, and didn't let us want for anything without a responsive inquiry or suggestion.   The food had a perfect blend of favors, herbs, and meats. I had the Lomo Saltado as my main entree. It has beef tenderloin strips sautéed with onions over French fries. It comes with white rice.  The meat was tender and seasoned to perfection. The combination of tomatoes, onions with potatoes really complemented the entree.   For an appetizer, we shared the fried yucca root called Yuquitas Fritas. It was crispy and came with a delicious sauce. I definitely recommend it. They also provided us with a small serving of Peruvian roasted corn, similar to corn nuts, along with a Aji dipping sauce. This was good. Also, I had two glasses of the passion fruit juice. I really liked it!  I sampled from my friends dish too. He was adventurous and tried a combination plate that included marinated chicken, beef, and cow heart. Initially, I was not thinking I would try the cow heart, but it seemed harmless enough. To my surprise it was fabulous!! Honestly, you need to put it on your bucket list of things to try.   The restaurant was beautifully adorned with Peruvian artifacts and art. The place was comfortable and clean. It's a small place and not very noisy. I felt like a queen for an evening dinning out at Mi Peru with my special friend. This is a place that I will return to."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is to die for....my favs are lomo saltado and arroz mariscos...yummmm! I go to this restaurant every time I'm in town. During my last visit...I tried the Sangria..delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while visiting Vegas. We ordered ceviche de pescado, chicharrón, seco de carne y aji de gallina. Every single plate we ordered was delicious!!! I definitely feel that this is one of the better Peruvian restaurants I've tried."}
{"text":"After a day on the road on our way to Las Vegas we wanted good food. We stopped at Mi Peru at 8:45 at night right before closing and they took us in. We had a delicious feast of chicken skewers (very delicious), fried rice, and more. We also ordered a family favorite, fried plantains! Not only was the food delicious, the service was excellent and the portions are large. Don't let the strip mall setting turn you off. Mi Peru is worth your effort."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday in July, since he's originally from Peru.  It was a surprise and he loved it!  I promised him I wouldn't give it 5 stars, ONLY because it \"wasn't as good as his mom's\", but I do have to say it was delicious.  He ordered everything for us, as he's the expert, so I don't REALLY know what we ate, but it was yummy!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. The food is so so... and quite overpriced! It doesn't worth it at all. They don't do any substitution of sides without extra charging, even if you take out any of the original sides. No wondering why the place was so empty... price and food taste explain it! Not coming back."}
{"text":"Super friendly service of beautifully crafted delicious creations.   Fried corn and yucca with a spicy cilantro sauce will keep your taste buds buzzing while you peruse a wide selection of sea meats, chickens, and beef while sipping on frosted mugs of crystal or cusqueña. There's a nice variety of SouthAmerican wines, too and sangría if your palate so desires.   The pollo saltado (tried by rec of another yelper) is exquisite. Onions, peppers, chicken (or beef) sautéed to tender warm richness in a hearty sauce. Order it with tacu tacu (fried rice w beans) or have it as made w fries and steamed rice. The spices are warm rich and filling but not hot spicy.   Homemade desserts including passion fruit pie are a great end to a tasty meal.   Can't wait to go back! This place definitely gets my badge... Amazeballs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! I ordered the tallerines verde and it turned out exactly like the pictures. The meat was tender and the pasta was perfectly cooked. I would definitely come here again to try other dishes. The service was also great, there was a young guy working the place and his spirit was so lively! Such a pleasant experience for my first time trying peruvian food."}
{"text":"WOW 20 dollars for a bistec a lo pobre ok I was fine at first but come on. The quality of this food is not great and amount of food you get is not worth 20 bucks there are other Peruvian restaurants way better than this one."}
{"text":"I love to try new restaurants. This one was sadly lacking. I order the rice and seafood dish. I was very disappointed. There was not much flavor and very fishy tasting and smelling. When I told the waiter I could not eat it and ask if I could get something else, he was not accommodating at all. He basically told me you ordered it, too bad, you have to eat it. About 10 minutes later he came back and said I could have a small dish of arroz con pollo. This restaurant is on my do not return list."}
{"text":"Was very happy with our experience here. When we walked in it was completely EMPTY.  We sat down in out private restaurant for about 10 min and then a lot of other people showed up.  The server was very friendly and informative about the options. The food was very very good..meat melted in your mouth and it was just very filling and delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Now there aren't a lot of Peruvian options here in the desert. Now, I have multiple favorite Peruvian places but of course they're out of town. The food here is great and I can't say that I've had a bad experience ever.   My favorite is the Aji de Gallina which I guess the best way to describe its a creamy curry/stew dish with chicken and potatoes. The flavors are great and hands down I order it at EVERY Peruvian spot.   Ceviche is always a go to as the flavors and texture is really what makes it, so if you like sushi do not pass this up.   My other half prefers the arroz con pollo and it also is an amazing choice. The flavors are unlike anything I've had. I'm Asian so I'm pretty picky when it comes to rice.   The food is good but it's not mind blowing, again I have to base this decision considering I eat my fair share of Peruvian.   So, in other words come eat and make a decision for yourself! If you've never had Peruvian you will most definitely be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"A lot of information they neglect to tell you, probably the most important thing being that they don't split checks. Food portions did not match the price, and there's almost no flexibility in ordering as well.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you're having Peruvian, you have to have the corn juice.  It's non-carbonated, sugary goodness with a hint of cloves and cinnamon.  For me, it's like an appetizer and a drink.  The chaufa is excellent here.  It's fried rice, and is very salty, but I assume if you're ordering it, you'll like that.  Get the one with chicken and beef (and shrimp if you like it).  I don't think it's better than the places in NYC, but it's certainly better than the crap they serve in California.  And for Vegas, it's worth four stars.  Definitely should be tried, especially if you haven't had delicious Peruvian food."}
{"text":"We just went there as part of a field trip and they were very accomodating. The food was excellent and the chicha is amazing."}
{"text":"Well I pushed because a friend said it was great. My husband is from Peru and said \"It's not good, but I'll give it another chance\" So I should have just believed him!  The best part were the Yucca fries with Aji but why too over priced! $9.95!!!   I ordered the Aji de Gallina, it looked nice when it came to the table, I'm just sad it didn't taste that way. It was flavorless and my rice was stale. I added salt and some other aji sauce they brought but no hope for it. I brought it home today hoping maybe I can save it with some Peruvian pastes I have here....  My husband has the Pollo a la Brasa called \"Our Peruvian award winner rotisserie chicken\" he said the Costco chicken is better. I didn't bother to taste it because it looked boring as hell too.  Our son had the steak... once again no flavor!  My husband said \"who the would vote them BEST for 2014\" I said \"they must have known they were getting voted on those days and called in a real chef to cook for it.\"   THIS was the biggest waste of $70.00 for Father's day!  Take a PASS if you want Peruvian Food!   Stick with Lima Limon or Inka!"}
{"text":"Very tasty meal. The seafood rice was cooked perfectly and chicken with rice was flavored nicely. The service was attentive and polite.   It's an under the radar kind of place. Wish I had tried one of the flavored fruit drinks.   Would I go back? Yes, Yes I would."}
{"text":"I was very surprised when I walked in here.    It's tucked into the back of a quiet and clean strip mall, so I wasn't expecting something with this much personality and flavor.  I've never been to Peru, or any of South America, for that matter.  But I've had a great meal before, and you can find it here.  The tastes were brilliant, and the food was fresh and interesting.  The Chicarones (fried and grilled pork) just melted right on your tongue, and its fatty delicious goodness reminded you that yes there is a god, he is good, and he blesses us with good food like this.  They've got South American beers and all sorts of region specific things to order.  A friend of mine ordered the purple corn drink, which was similar to Horchata without the milk.    Whatever the context, you can be sure that if you find your way here you'll leave satisfied, and if you're like me and haven't tried this type of food before - you'll leave a new fan."}
{"text":"The food was great.  I had the Arroz con Pollo and tried a couple of other dishes that friends ordered.  Be aware that this is not a vegetarian-friendly place though; there are no main dishes with just veggies (which is why it's 4 rather than 5 stars).  We went with a group of 12 on a Monday night and they accommodated us easily, despite the fact that it's a small place.  I'll definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service. The food is authentic and delicious. The place is very clean and child friendly! The service is excellent and the food came out hot and quick. Lomo Saltado, papa la huancaina- oh my gosh!!! I never want to leave."}
{"text":"Amazing soup and rotisserie chicken!  Service awesome, owner is very nice and friendly and is from Peru!  Prices very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I miss the great Peruvian back in SoCal and I decided to give this place a roll for dinner.  The setting of the restaurant was well decorated and pleasant.  However, I must rail against playing pan flute music in a Peruvian business and I cite the South Park episode on pan flutists as my justification.  The highlights of the meal were the fact they had chicha morada (purple corn drink) and the papa huancaina (potatoes in a spicy cream sauce); however, the chicha wasn't as flavorful as I hoped.  For the entree I had the fried fish which was seasoned well, but surprisingly omitted was a sauce for the fish. There was an onion/corn garnish on the side with the plain white rice, but really doesn't mix with the fish.  The server was polite and for the most part attentive.    My overall experience was ok, but I am disappointed the food was not nearly as exciting as the Peruvian I'm used to back in SoCal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It was our first time trying Peruvian. I cannot believe we didn't come here sooner. O.M.G. I was blown away. I had the Aji de Gallina. There is this amazing spicy green sauce they give when you first sit down. We are huge fans of spicy, and this was excellent. The restaurant is clean and decorated culturally. The music is relaxing. It is all popular top 40s hits, but they have all been redone into acoustic/elevator type versions. Our friends are adventurous eaters and we cannot wait to bring them here."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, aji sauce is ok. Overall I would come back, they're seafood paella is delicious and has big portions good for two or three people."}
{"text":"Is a nice restaurant , great food , excellent service by Antonio , we love the ceviche  , definitely we will come back ."}
{"text":"Being the only Peruvian restaurant that I know of around town, I like to stop in from time to time to try their different dishes.  It's weird, this place has been around for years and it never seems to be busy.  The few times that I have been in, we have been either the only table or one of two.  Either way, I'm glad this place is still open!  It is really close to my house, in a good neighborhood, and has amazing food!  It's best in Las Vegas for a reason.  Their arroz con pollo is my go to but my dad recently had their secco de carne and that too was fantastic.  I am never disappointed with this place, let's just say that!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out today and I was very disappointed for various reasons:  1. SLOW SERVICE. When I came to pick up the food, the restaurant was stark empty. It had been 20 minutes since I phoned in the order but the food wasn't ready yet. Did I mention the restaurant was stark empty? 2. WRONG ORDER Then, I got home and opened the to go box and lo and behold it was the wrong order! I had ordered the lomo saltado (beef dish) and they ended up giving me a chicken and rice dish. It should have at least been within the same species!  3. UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN So I'm already annoyed that they gave me the wrong order. But then we cut into the chicken and the damn thing is bleeding.  4. TERRIBLE AJI SAUCE Did anyone at the restaurant taste test the sauce? It wasn't even \"salty\" I was literally eating a pile of salt stirred into cream.  5. MY OTHER ORDER THEY MANAGED TO GET RIGHT: AGUADITO CON POLLOS This is the description on the menu: \"a classic soup made of chicken thighs with cilantro, rice, diced potatoes, vegetables and peruvian spices.\" Well there was some chicken thighs, 1/2 of a potato, few slices of carrot, and the broth did not tantalize me with the supposed peruvian spices. $10 soup, common now!  I've eaten here, on site and take-out, about 5 times and each experience was a shaky 3 stars for me. Eeks, now they've really made it hard for me to go back!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my top favorite restaurants. The flavors from the meat and rice are to die for."}
{"text":"Noticed many good reviews for this restaurant, so wanted to give it a try. The restaurant itself looks nice, although the interior plywood siding gives it an \"unfinished\" feeling that I wasn't very fond of.  Frankly, it just wasn't that spectacular for the price. Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes."}
{"text":"This place had the best civiche I have had the pleasure of tasting. The owner was friendly and made sure we were comfortable . Location is a bit hidden but worth finding. I also had the aji de gallina and it was delicious.  Next time I'm in Henderson i will stop by again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food if you see the beef heart kabobs on the menu I suggest ordering them atmosphere friendliness service all 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Super high quality home made dishes. Failed to take a pic because we consumed our food so quickly! Seriously, come check this place out."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I couldn't. I have had Peruvian food across the US and I have to say that this one falls towards the bottom of my list. It is a cute spot with great service. However, the food is definitely not what it should be for the prices you pay. I ordered a bowl of the Aguadito soup, it was barely warm and tasted bland. Then comes the Chaufa de Mariscos (Fried rice cooked with soy sauce, shrimp, mussels, octopus, calamari and scallops). I was horrified, the seafood was NOT fresh, it was by far the worst I've ever had and not to mention that the scallops were nowhere to be found! All that seafood must of came straight from the freezer and onto my plate! And the calamari, let's talk about that. My rice was full of it, I think there was more calamari then rice itself, not exaggerating. I was starving so I had to put myself through eating this so that I don't waste all the $$ this costs, and then I bite into a rock. I told the waiter and he brings someone out and he didn't even say who he was and said, it's from the mussels, they are smooth but sometimes we miss a spot. At this point, I was already mad so I ignored it. I mean I could've cracked my teeth and that's all you can say? I stopped eating and gave in. Then at the end, they gave me complimentary flan, which is a nice gesture but even that didn't taste good! It looked and tasted like it had been around for a while. I am so mad that I spent all that money on terrible dish! My Husband had the Lomo Saltado and he said it was good, but with this experience, I can't say that we will be back! Don't waste your $ on this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE Peruvian food...and that's probably because I'm half-Peruvian. Unfortunately for me, my Peruvian mother does not cook that many dishes from her native country and that leaves my tummy sad and deprived. Anytime we have a chance to check out a Peruvian place though, we will try it. Mi Peru is probably the best Peruvian restaurant here in Vegas and is somewhat comparable to my grandmother's cooking which is to die for. I've been here several times and for my latest visit, I brought my boyfriend a long so he could eat some nom-noms. I had a gift certificate from restaurant.com for $25 as long as you spend $50. Not a problem considering that this place is a little pricey and that's why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.  As I mentioned before, food is great. We had:  Drinks: Chicha Morada...the Peruvian purple drink. A juice made from purple corn, it is sweet and delicious. Definitely try this! We got a pitcher because I knew I'd want more than one glass. 15 bucks for a pitcher though, ouch! I bought packets of chicha morada juice mix when I was in Peru for 10 cents a packet and those make a pitcher...so not a great deal there..especially since I am pretty sure they are using the packets mixes also...  Appetizer: Ceviche, which is chopped fish marinated in lime juice and chopped onions. I asked the server what kind of fish they used and he said Mahi-Mahi. I'm not sure if this changes from time to time so be sure to ask in case you don't like fish. It is served with a slice of sweet potato, yellow potato, roasted Peruvian corn and fresh Peruvian corn kernels which are large, not like the ones we are used to here. Now, I am NOT a huge seafood person but this is so delicious, I just can't put my fork down, seriously. The lime juice \"cooks\" the fish so there is no fishy flavor and it probably helped that the fish was SUPER fresh. The only problem with this dish was that we waited a long time for it so they probably just prepared it before bringing it out. When we make it at home, we let it marinate a couple hours before eating it...but like I said, it was delicious!  Entrees: I got the Seco de Carne which is beef marinated in a cilantro sauce. This is usually my favorite but here the sauce wasn't up to par and didn't taste like cilantro at all. The beef was tender and juicy and the rice and beans served with it were also very delicious. My boyfriend and everyone else we were with got the lomo saltado which is strips of beef sauteed with peppers, onions on top of french fries and served with rice. Everyone who got this dish was very happy and I couldn't blame them. Meat was tasty and flavorful. Everything works together so well.  We skipped dessert because one, we were so full and two, because the stuff is kind of pricey, we decided against it.  Service is okay, kind of on the slow side but they are nice and the food is AWESOME so no biggie. This place isn't close to me so I can't come too often but my boyfriend Justin J. LOVED it so he keeps asking me to go back. We will definitely be back...unless my grandmother is in town. :)"}
{"text":"The best Peruvian food I've had in Vegas so far. I had Arroz con Pollo and my husband had Lomo Saltado a really flavorful beef dish. We will be back. The server was nice but not too helpful with suggestions (he just said it's all good- come on you don't have a favorite?). I do recommend this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our family went here over this past weekend, and this was our first trip. The restaurant is located very far east in Henderson, so the reviews stating that this restaurant is \"out of the way\" are correct.   We ordered three meat dishes, and each of them were delicious. We ordered the Seco de Carne (which came out like stewed heaven on a plate) as well as the highly recommended Lomo Saltado (if you like grilled beef with veggies, then you will love this). They pour love into their food here. We also ordered fried yucca root sticks (Yuquitas Fritas) for an appetizer, and they were phenomenal. We also ordered a fruit pie for dessert: a passion fruit confection that was amazing. The dessert wasn't sugary, with cloying sweetness, and was naturally sweetened...which is such a nice way to finish a meal. We'll assuredly go again. We highly recommend this place.   Some reviewers noted that portions were small here. We didn't find portions were small at all. Portions were actually perfect and not overdone. I think sometimes we expect portions to be very huge. If you actually take the time to look at the plate, you'll find one complete portion of meat (i.e., 3 oz is recommended), appropriate size of veggies, appropriate size of rice (i.e., one cup). Take the drive, try it, you'll like it.   Note: We ordered dinner meals during the lunch hour, which made the food more expensive ($15-17/plate). Lunch portions include a starter cup of soup."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a casual dinner in Henderson and thought we would try a new restaurant. We have never had Peruvian food. This little restaurant in one of the malls was just what we were looking for. They were not too busy on Friday evening, we were able to be seated right away. The host was friendly and offered us menus followed by drinks in good order. He was able to help us with the menu and answer questions.   We opened with a Peruvian beer and some fried calamari. The beer was crisp and light, the calamari was crisp and heavy.  My wife had the Lomo saltado, marinated strips of beef and onions over French fries with a side of white rice. no vegetables obviously but tasty nonetheless. To be fair she did not need both french fries and rice. I added the rice to my soup.I had the parihuelo described as creole bouillabaisse. Saffron broth, plenty of seafood with a touch of cilantro. It was very good.  We thought the meal was good, and a good value."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch Sunday afternoon. He ordered a chicken soup (aguadito de pollo), that was absolutely delicious. By the way, it came with a house salad that was also delicious.  The waiter explained that it had been freshly prepared because the chef happen to be there on Sundays. Lucky for us!  As to myself, I ordered a fish spicy dish called tiradito. The taste was really good, except that I would have liked some onions, and/or tomates to go with. Being that no crackers or chips are offered- wink! However, it's a matter of preference or custom!  Lastly, the fresh purple water is really tasty & my husband really enjoyed the beer.  We will definitely go back & we definitely recommend it 100%!"}
{"text":"Best Ceviche & chicha Morada outside of Peru.  Ceviche is very fresh just like the costal towns in Peru. I travel a lot and I can say we are very lucky to have a restaurant of this Caliber in Las Vegas. None of the top notch restaurants in the strip that serve ceviche come close to freshness, taste and authenticity of this establishment. Their chicha Morada is homemade and it blows other similar drinks to pieces.  I always passed by this restaurant and was reluctant to try it at first since the shopping center it is located is large and secluded.  I now regret why I did not try this restaurant earlier. Don't make the mistake I made....you may regret it!"}
{"text":"tWe tried this place on a whim on a Monday night. And we arrived pretty late. But the wait staff were still accommodating. We ordered the green muscle ceviche app, the pescado sudado, and some extra cilantro rice. I can honestly say that it was one of my best meals in Vegas and I've been a lot of places including the high end joints. The muscles were fresh and the marinade they were in was light and perfectly balanced. The fish was incredible...light, succulent and melted in your mouth with an amazing sauce that went perfectly with both the plain and cilantro rice. This may be my new favorite place. For the quality the prices are more than fair. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have only eaten the lomo saltado which is meat and French fries and I think it's pretty damn good.  When I eat at the restaurant they serve you some kind of peanuts and they are yummy.  On to why they got knocked 2 stars. They serve the food with a green Chile sauce.  I have eaten Peruvian food before and I literally drench it in that stuff. We just ordered to plates of lomo saltado and we specifically asked for more of the green sauce. They gave us 2.  My wife asked for more and they said no. I have been to the restaurant a few times and we have this discussion every time. I ask for as many of the green Chile sauce served in those tiny containers and each time they bring out 1 or 2.  When I complain and ask for more they tell me no.   I'm always told no because they say they didn't make enough. There is a great Peruvian place called mamitas in Glendale California I use to go to all the time and they served that stuff in a squeeze botttle. I would drench it in that stuff.  I love love love that sauce so when these people are so damn chinsy it pisses me off.  At first it was a laughing matter, kind of a joke but I'm eating my meal now and I wish I had more. You guys need to make a ton of that green Chile and never tell your customers they can't have anymore.  Stop limiting my green Chile.  It's ridiculous.   You would get he 5 stars if you gave me more Chile like I requested. I'm not used to being told no over condiments so this whole situation is kray. Make more Chile and keep your customers happy. My wife is scrapping the lid right now and this little container we isn't even filled half way!!!!!"}
{"text":"I probably never would have tried Mi Peru had it not been for Groupon. It's on the other side of town, and I had never heard of it before. Fortunately, Groupon came along and helped introduce us.  For an appetizer we had causa de tuna which was consisted of tuna salad, mashed potatoes, and a hard boiled egg. I never would have thought to pair tuna and mashed potatoes, but it was surprisingly good.  I had a Cusquena (Peruvian beer) to wash it down. It was pretty good.  For our entrees we had tallarin saltado (chicken and spaghetti) and the anticucho combo (chicken breast, beef tenderloin, and beef heart kabobs). Both meals were very good. I preferred the tallarin saltado since it was a little more unique.  As a side dish we ordered canchita (deep fried corn). It was basically like corn nuts with a tasty sauce. I liked it quite a bit.  While Mi Peru is kinda far from us, I'll probably go back. The food was very good an unique."}
{"text":"We have now been here 9 times and i can honestly say that it is an absolute gem, every time we have been we have had a new server but still a fantastic service, this is not a typical Vegas place this is not a strip property this is a legit mom and pop store with great ambience outstanding service and lets not forget the food which is absolutely spot on, consistently good and delicious!  A must to try is the white fish Ceviche for a starter, the portion is generous and it is just a fantastic dish.  We have tried a lot here and again it has all been great, if you have the chance please don't miss the opportunity to dine here, i don't care if you are a tourist or local this is a great place."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 4-5 stars, but that's not going to happen. Ironically, the food was well prepared, but it just lacked any flavor. We ordered Yucca fries (overpriced), and Lomo Saltado (meat was tender, but under seasoned). Now, it wasn't as if they were very busy and just didn't cook our food properly. The place was empty and the only other people eating were some of the workers.   The worst part was the dessert. We ordered one of their pies. What we got was a brick of ice. We asked about it and we were told it comes like that. Yet, on other yelp pictures and google info it shows/says otherwise.   Unfortunately, I will not be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I can't really compare it to any other Peruvian food, so I will just base it on whether I liked it or not. It's not quite a 4, but it's more than a 3. I wish Yelp would just make it 1-10, but I guess we would all still do the same thing.    We came in on a quiet evening, which was lovely. It's very unassuming from the outside, and had I never hopped on Yelp, I wouldn't have seen it. In fact my husband almost left because he didn't believe me it would be worth it. But, I had never had Peruvian, and I felt it would fit into his palate within reason (he's a little less adventurous)   Our server was attentive, and was helpful in offering direction with questions. To drink I figured I would try the Chicha Morada (purple corn drink), which was intriguing. At first I wasn't sure about it, but it grew on me and it kinda was a palate cleanser. It's got some spice to it (not heat, more clove-cinnamon-y with a fruity base.) Interesting to say the least and definitely worth giving at try.. I would get it again. The fried corn they serve upon your seating is fun (I hardly got any, because my husband took the spoon and ate it) but the winner is actually the green sauce that goes with it. We also ordered the Yuquitas Fritas (which are Yucca Fries) as an appetizer. I didn't want to get too crazy because as I said, DH has a limited palate so, this was safe. They were good, nothing to woohoo about.   Entrée. I picked both of our entrees. Mostly because my husband hates reading menus and when he can't tell what it is from the title he just gets annoyed. I got the Aji de Gallina and ordered him the Bistec con Mariscos. My entrée reminded me of semi-exotic comfort food. It wasn't intimidating in any way and by the end of the meal grew on me and as I write this, I want more. My husband's entrée was also very good, although the seafood part was a little seafood-y to me. However, to be fair, certain foods in my world don't touch and so this was a little hard for me to handle anyway. Also, if you don't like the calamari in the shape of baby squids, pass. There are a lot on the plate. Hubby couldn't do that. They calamari was super chewy, so not a total win in my book, but the steak was surprisingly awesome. Very tender and flavorful. Mixed with the sauce and rice, yum.   Price-well considering how much seafood was on the beef, but I felt maybe a tad overpriced. My dish was good. It was probably right where it should be based on it's ingredients, but maybe a dollar less would have mentally put me elsewhere on it. Weird how that psychology injected into everything.   Again. I have no Peruvian food to compare this to, but it was good and definitely worth a stop. Our service was great, food was good, and we will probably be back when we are around the area."}
{"text":"I can't even describe how wonderful their food is. Everything is fresh, made to order, and bursting with flavor. I have tried three dishes here, and they all have been spectacular.   1. Tallarines Verdes- Breaded steak and pesto spaghetti sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  I am not sure this is considered Peruvian, since my Italian grandparents used to make this dish. However, the pasta is cooked perfectly and the meat is seasoned to perfection. No salt needed!  2. Loma Saltado- Tender beef strips sautéed with tomatoes, onions, and French fries -served over steamed rice.  Oh man, this dish is so tasty. The meat is not fatty, tender, and melts in your mouth. The sauce this dish comes with complements each flavor and soaks in to the delicious pile of rice.  This dish is a must try! 3. Seco de carne- Beef stewed in cilantro and Peruvian spices, rice, potatoes, peas, and carrots. If I could have one meal for the rest of my life -this would be it.  The beef is slow cooked and falls apart with your fork. I almost passed out when I tried this dish. Food can't possibly this good- can it? Yes!   What I like most about his restaurant, is that it doesn't know how good it is. In other words, they are continually trying to improve on perfection with their meals. They are not cutting corners!  The qualities of meat they use are top notch, and the portions are substantial. Prices are moderate, as you can expect to pay 15-20 per entrée.  The place also does well as a takeout option. Last time I got food to go, it was still piping hot when I got home (15 minutes later).   I love it here, and wish everyone in Las Vegas would give this place a try. If you have never had Peruvian food--this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Being half Peruvian and grew up eating Peruvian food I can say that Mi Peru does a great job. The food is so tasty with great flavor. I have been there a few times with my wife and we always leave with our stomachs more than satisfied. The service is also great. We always enjoy ourselves when we go."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8pm on Feb 12th, 2010 to find the place severely understaffed (one server, one busboy) while servicing at least 7 other tables. Needless to say it did take a while for us to get our drinks. But our server was gracious, calm and attentive, which is quite impressive considering the volume of such a little place. We settled on an Argentinian Malbec, priced very reasonably, to go with our meal.   We ordered the Ceviche as an appetizer and it did not disappoint. Layers of sumptuous seafood, peppered with cilantro and red onions. A solid helping of cancha (a peruvian snack made from large corn kernels that are tossed in hot oil until puffed and golden brown) as well as a perfect amount of acidity in the citrus.  Our dinner consisted of a moderately portioned. Aji de Gallina* and Arroz con Pollo*. Two dishes I had as a child, growing up in Peru. Although both entrees were well balanced and tasty, they weren't quite as flavorful as they could've been. And I think my mom, bless her soul, would've done a better job of them. I know you can't compare the feeling of your mother's cooking with restaurant food but I think they could've pushed themselves a bit, specially on a friday night. We had a great time nonetheless and took a few pictures of the beautiful servings. We finished the meal with 4 alfajorcitos or small alfajores. A type of peruvian pastry consisting of two round cakes sandwiched with honey and condensed milk in the middle and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Very small and simple and delicious.   Overall, we will come back again just for the ceviche and maybe try some cuzqueña beer and their other dishes. Taking advantage of their patio this upcoming summer.  *Aji de Gallina (Peppered Chicken) is a Peruvian classic made with aji peppers, chicken, and a cream sauce.   *Arroz con Pollo (chicken with rice) is cooked in a mild cilantro sauce, with corn kernels, and small pieces of carrots, peas and red onions."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM. Whenever we come here, the first two things we order is the fish ceviche and the mussels! The ceviche is perfectly limey and sour and delicious and the mussels have this awesome pico type garnish on top of them!  SOOOO good! I really don't need to eat ANYTHING else when I come here as this is thje main reason I come here! Those two items are a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I live very close to Mi Peru Restaurant, so it was very convenient for us to have peruvian food there, but this place is not for Peruvians, is for people that don't know our food. We, as Peruvians that know our food, are picky and expect traditional food . Last time I was very disappointed, because the \"causa de camarones\" (shrimp causa) got smaller and had less shrimp that my previous visit and on top of that, the price got higher. They put peas on the causa and that has to add quantity to the plate, because causa doesn't come with peas.   The fish cebiche was made with tilapia and the pieces of fish were thin like for \"tiradito\" instead of chunks for \"cebiche\". I told my server that $20 for a tilapia cebiche should be a felony. I am not going back to My Peru."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots. I used to bring people here all the time. Last night I went for dinner, The server was very rude, Like extremely rude. I didn't finish dinner. Asked for check before finishing the appetizer and left. If this continues I expect this place will be out of business very soon. 2 stars because the food was still very good"}
{"text":"So I decided to try out this lovely place. It's very nice when you walk in. It has nice wooden chairs and tables and the vibe is relaxed. So I was greeted promptly by this lovely young lady. I was seated and started browsing the menu. I saw they have vegetarian dishes plus most of their dishes you can actually not include the meat and they would be just as delectable. I ordered the Yuca root starter and then had a vegetable dish with rice. Let's start off with the Yuca dish. This was a yummy surprise. They're like large french fries. But you know how sometimes french fries could even be messed up. These lovely treats we're cooked to perfection. They were crispy on the outside and have this nice softer texture in the middle and just have this dipping sauce that that I have to say I gobbled up. I would literally eat those all day. So I'm already in a good mood after trying those lovely things. then my plate of food came with steam coming off of it and a mound of cooked veggies with potatoes, carrots, peas, onions, cilantro, everything and had this sauce on it and on the side a Mound of rice. I wasn't sure it could get better then the yuca. But did it ever. That plate of food changed me. I wanted to dive in the plate and just live there for a while. It's so good that even though you're full your mouth is saying please keep putting that in me. I don't know if they hired Wolfgang Puck for the day to cook back there. But hats off to the chef. Also to the owner for putting this place where I was allowed to eat it. I'm a bit selfish I only want it for me. Mi Peru you get two thumbs way the heck up and the never heard of \"STEP OFF WERE THE BEST\" award. Your Chef needs to drop the mic after that one. Thank you for lunch!"}
{"text":"I am not gonna try and spell the dishes we had tonight, but whatever we got was really good, especially the soup!!!  We also enjoyed the Peruvian Rose wine... surprisingly delicious! The service was fine.  We went on a Tuesday evening, so the place wasn't very busy.  I wonder what they have for dessert.  We were too full to get any dessert. I definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I've had Peruvian food from all over the world. Vienna, Stockholm, NY, Miami, you name it and we've been there. I have to say this is probably the best Peruvian food I've had on the west coast. We came at noon, plenty of parking, came in and were seated right away.   Waiter took our drink orders immediately, and gave us some corn nuts with spicy sauce to munch on while me and Ellen F. perused the menu. They have an $8.95 lunch special between 11-3 which looked good but after seeing the Lomo Saltado picture and my previous experience with this dish I had to have it.   This was the perfect kind of mix. Lomo Saltado has beef steak strips, sliced tomatoes, sliced onions and rice. What I got had just the right amount of everything, no complaints whatsoever and it was satisfying. I killed the steak then mixed the leftover sauce with the rice. YUMMY!    There aren't to many Peruvian spots in town, this is the second joint I've tried. If your in the Hendo area I highly recommend you check it out. They do have Peruvian booze, I forgot to ask if they have Inca Kola if your into that. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"If you haven't dined here, you are certainly missing out - yeah you! They whip up Peruvian food with immense love and flavor!   They have the most incredible Lomo Saltado I have ever had. Steak and potatoes elevated to new heights! They make it with tenderloin strips, sauteed onions and tomatoes, plated over french fries and rice soaking in all of the delicious brown stir-fry sauce. This is a winning combination! We added a few dashes of salt and it really woke up the entire dish. Flavor rating: 5/5  The Lomo Saltado is served with their house green \"aji\" sauce and baby, that sauce is to die for!! It's slightly spicy, very smooth, herbaceous and somewhat tangy. It brought so much life to the table; it was incredibly fresh and vibrant! This is one of the best versions I have ever tasted. You know I asked for multiple refills - heck, I can see myself dipping a boot in that sauce and enjoying it. Flavor rating: 5/5  We also tried the Papa A La Huancaina which is boiled potatoes swimming in a rich and creamy yellow sauce called Huancaína. It comes garnished with some black olives and a hard boiled egg slice. As we never had this dish before, my fiancé and I thought the boiled potatoes were too simple, but the cream sauce was truly excellent. Flavor rating: 4/5  The portions are large and ideal for sharing. We left completely satisfied and stuffed with a large doggy bag with leftovers of both dishes."}
{"text":"Love it always great food and service... I've been a loyal customer for almost when it first opened , when ever friends and family come to town it's my go to spot it never fails everyone loves it....."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and just never got around to reviewing it. It's usually not very busy for whatever reason but the food is great. We always get great service and prompt food. I've tried their Lomo Saltado many times and it's legit! I've also tried their yucca and plantains many times. I just tried the seco de carne for the first time and it was amazing. Tasted like something I'd eat in the home of an abuelita. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Food here was quite excellent. We ordered several dishes and everyone loved what they had. The pricing is a bit expensive for a lunch, but portions overall were quite large.   At the table, we ordered the following Lomo saltado Anticucho Combo Tallarin Saltado Arroz con Mariscos  Despite the good food, service was really slow in getting the food, and the server didn't come by that often. Considering we were the only table for the longest time, I'm not sure why it took that long for the food to come out."}
{"text":"I rushed home just now so I can talk about our experience here. I  We used our Groupon and was charged 18% gratuity and then was taxed on the gratuity just because had a Groupon! I have NEVER heard of that before on a 2 party dinner - 18% and then tax on it? It's SO shady. There are signs posted every where that you must forfeit your coupon before you order. We knew there was going to be a surprise at the end.  Initially we paid the $15 for the $30 dinner with Groupon. We ended up paying $20 extra for this dinner because the waiter said our 2 entrees did not meet the Groupon Amt $30. So we ordered a desert.   Then the surprise! The check...  Get this:  Meal 1: 15.95 Meal 2: 11.95 Flan Dessert: 4.95 Beer: 4.95 Not included per Groupon, boo to Groupon!  Tax: 3.06 Gratuity 18% for 2 people: 6.80 Gratuity Tax: .55  Food: Meh, I've had better. It may be a different flavor in Vegas, but if you're from a real met city, this is 'meh' at best....honestly.  If you're the owner, do talk to us about this. Groupon is suppose to be a marketing tool but you just ruined yourself - you're soooo sneaky, are ya?"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident and was pleasantly surprised. The food was flavorful and service was pretty decent. We went in around 8pm and there was one other table, so it was a ghost town.   The chicken in the Arroz con Pollo was fantastic, as was everything else in the dish. The green sauce was one of the better I've had.   We definitely felt rushed when eating here though. No staff was really out on the floor, so it was a little strange. By the time we were finishing up around 8:50, we definitely got the feeling they wanted us to leave as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Holy corn kernel, Batman!  They must import special (heirloom?) varieties of corn with giant chewy kernels that is served as an appetizer with a delicious dip.  We've eaten here small handful of times and have had decent experiences.  First, Peruvian food in general is pretty heavy on meats, beware vegetarians.  The style of the food is pretty simple, some chicken/fish/meat, stewed in tomatoes (of sorts), and often over rice.  My experiences with the chicken have been moist and relatively flavorful, but pretty tame on the spice.  The flavors are interesting in the Pescado con salsa de camarones (fried fillet of tilapia-esque fish, with a tomato based shrimp sauce).  It was light and pleasant.  Estofado de Pollo.  This is a chicken stewed in tomato sauce and Peruvian spices and served with steamed rice.  It was a pleasant, simple flavor, reminding me of home cooking.  I have had the cevice a couple of times, sometimes limey and delicious, others it has been a bit \"off\".    Overall, the flavors are often subtle, good, and reminiscent of general purpose comfort foods.  the style is not hot, punch you in the face spicy like Thai and Indian cuisine, but hearty and soothing.  It's not my favorite style of food (I like my flavors a bit more bold), but good for a change every now and then."}
{"text":"Great food, AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called earlier today and got transfered three times. The server I talked to didn't speak spanish at all and she didn't seem to understand the dish names. Therefore, she placed the wrong order. When I called back to fix it, they refused to do so and hung up on me. Their server, Anthony, was REALLY RUDE and ask me if I was actually going to go because I was \"wasting his time\". Extremely disrespectful.  I'm really ashamed of peruvian restaurants with this horrible customer service and despiteful waiters. Food might be good, but definitely not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today based on other Yelper reviews. What a wonderful restaurant. Quiet and comfy, we received excellent service and the food was everything one could hope for. Absolutely delicious from the app to the main courses. Very tasty, we are bookmarking and anxious to return."}
{"text":"Our host/server was Antonio. We were here in 2010 and now we are back again because I wanted Ceviche! I think they have the best Ceviche hence the 5 stars! Antonio was pleasant, polite and answered our questions about the food without hesitations. Thank you Antonio!. The Ceviche Pescado was fresh and delicious. We will be back there soon!"}
{"text":"Just \"eh\".  The atmosphere is nice.  Lunch specials are minimal.  Prices are too high.  No pollo a la brasa??? My husband is from Peru and prefers to go all the way across town for Peruvian food rather than go to this place located conveniently down the street.  The food is fine, but no better than places that charge half the price.   Lower the prices, add the pollo a la brasa (always a favorite to anyone trying Peruvian food), and put a smile on your face when you greet your guests.  I've been here a few times over the years, just to keep giving it a chance.  I WANT to want to go here.  It's so CLOSE... instead we make the half hour trip elsewhere."}
{"text":"Having eaten the best of peruvian cuisine for a very long time we were intrigued as to the quality of this restaurant. First and foremost the price seemed pretty high for what they put on the table. This is not the best of what peruvian food has to offer. 3 people ate for almost $100.00. They brought a bread to the table that was stale, very poor quality and that should have been a warning which we did not heeded, they just heated the old bread and presented the offering with no shame. The ceviche was below par. We also had the mussels with their fresh salsa on top and that dish did not impress anyone. Tried the causa and it lacked the authenticity of taste that distinguishes this dish. One of our group had the \"arroz con pollo\" (cilantro based rice with two squalid pieces of chichen) and got a whole lot of rice with almost no chicken. The other had \"pescado sudado\" (poached fish) and even though edible it was not great. I had fish with a shrimp sauce which was acceptable but not great. I do understand that this is a special type of cuisine but like anything in life there are peruvian restaurants that are far superior in quality and taste and for the money it just did not ring any bells. Wanted to like it for we go constantly to Las Vegas but compared to the top ones in Los Angeles this one fell way short of the mark. The place was semi-empty at around 6PM, (something that never happens at \"El Rocoto\" in LA which is always buzzing with activity and you can feel the energy in the air) and the kitchen had absolutely no movement. This is definitely not a top choice and do beware of the high prices, which we wouldn't mind at all if the food was worth it. I give it an average 3 Stars and perhaps the reviews I saw in urbanspoon.com are written by people that hasn't had the very best of peruvian food or perhaps even relatives for I seriously contest this restaurant to be anywhere near a 5 Star eatery. Save your money and when in Los Angeles do go to \"El Rocoto\" (just google it) and you will enjoy every minute of it compared with this bland, uneventful take on peruvian food.  The reason I used \"El Rocoto\" as an example is because this is one place that never fails to deliver fresh, authentic and delicious peruvian food and every time I've gone there it always crowded and like everyone should know the more crowded the place the fresher the food because it is always being consumed, no room for food to grow stale or to be re-heated in worst scenarios. Top of the line Chefs from Peru doing what they do best. 3 Stars for Mi Peru."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. Great food and it's not expensive. They also deliver via postmates. The owner is nice here too."}
{"text":"Based on all the ravaging reviews we tried this near by place to our home . If you read all the non recommended reviews . I would have to say I agree . The food was overpriced for its quality . Meat was chewy and overloaded with French fries . Salty and just not that appetizing. Unfortunately won't be giving a 2nd chance ."}
{"text":"3.75 stars based on a single visit. I loved the traditional chicken soup (note to self: order one for the whole table, or make it your meal) and the special stew (sorry, forgot the name) was really yummy. Everything was well flavored and the staff was friendly and courteous. I would definitely go back to this place..."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite! Very nice service, servings are plentiful. Recommend the Cau Cau de Pollo. Casual and quiet."}
{"text":"Food is eeeexxxcccelent! Super great service by Andea. Very warm and cozy place to have a date night and try something new I would vouch for this place."}
{"text":"Our phones tried to take us in to a gated community, but we happened to find this place. The service was prompt without being intrusive and the recommendations were spot on. The green mussels are a must."}
{"text":"Mi Peru was a culinary adventure for me. The service was great and our waiter was happy to answer any of our newbie questions.  And menu was very explanatory. The South American flavors were new to me, but our meal was a wonderful combination of sweet and savory. A friend and I shared the Causa Tuna, Lomo Saltado, and a side of Platano frito (fried plantains). I was a little nervous about trying something so new and different,  but I was pleasantly surprised and will be back to try more of their dishes soon!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find the right combination of platters for a perfect Peruvian meal. The last feeding that took place was \"great success\"!  We start right off the bat with fish ceviche, mussels, and a side order of cilantro rice.  The ceviche and mussels are always on point.  The fish ceviche had a perfect acidic marinade to it. The tomato and onion garnish was always refreshing everytime I inhaled a mussel. The cilantro rice combos well with these two appetizers. I can easily get full off of these orders.  I always get the beef kabobs. They are always tender.  Whatever they marinate the kabobs in, tends to make it a tad bit salty. I think it's supposed to be on the salty side.  Whatever it is, it makes me keep ordering it whenever I'm feeding there. I'd like to order something else, but those damn kabobs man...  Great Success!!!"}
{"text":"Got some delivered to me because I haven't had Peruvian chicken in so long! Was suddenly craving. Wow. The Ceviche Mixto, yumz!!! Missing the corn on the cob. Arroz con Pollo was ok. I was missing my corn there too, why!!!!!! Were you guys out of corn that day?!? The Aji green sauce is to die for. I wanna jump in a bathtub of Aji green sauce and bathe in it.."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We ordered a causa de tuna, tiraditos, a chaufa, and a couple of desserts! We loved everything especially the tiraditos! The sauce was amazing. The causa de tuna was a definite favorite too. The chaufa was delicious and had plenty of shrimp and chicken in it. We liked the desserts as well but I would recommend their ice cream over the flan for sure."}
{"text":"Okay, okay! I told myself I would never be back and I lied. I came here because honestly there really isn't many options when you are craving Peruvian food. I will say, the service was good and the food was awesome. My BF is Peruvian and he really likes this place. I got the aji de gallino and he got the chichorrones. I don't eat pork, but he says it's cooked perfect. My aji de gallino was yummy and delicious! Their aji sauce (green) is yummy and I put that on everything! It's like the sirracha of Peru, goes good with everything. My friends got the the lomo saltaldo and seco. They both looked really great!! Instead of bread here, they give you roasted corn. It's like corn nuts but way better! I'm glad I gave this place another shot. If I'm back in Henderson, I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Attractive modern place. Had seafood (baby octopus, shrimp, and clams) and rice, my wife had deep fried yucca. Seafood was fresh and tasty, yucca came with spicy green salsa. Well prepared food."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch because I wanted to try Peruvian food and I'd figure it was finally time to check this place out because of all the positive reviews!   I ended up getting the lunch special which was about $9 and it came with a dish and a small bowl of soup. I got the Aji De Gallina per the recommendation of the waitress and my friend got the Arroz con pollo. Out of the two dishes my friend and I both liked mine better. My dish reminded me of a Japanese curry dish except the sauce is bright yellow and has shredded chicken and some veggies in it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the dish was and it made me feel good that I was able to enjoy a dish that didn't have any fried components lol. There was plenty of flavor from the sauce, a good amount of chicken meat, and the veggies were not overcooked and mushy. This is perfect comfort food that is filling and very easy to eat.   If you haven't been to this restaurant yet, I highly recommend that you come check it out! Their menu is a bit pricey, but I can understand why because the food is pretty good and the waitress said that everything is home-cooked and not pre-made. The food was so good that I am definitely going to come back and try out their other dishes. Before committing, I'd recommend coming in for their lunch special first and see if you like the food. After that, you can see if you would be willing to come back to try their signature dishes."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place many times and usually order the same thing.  Shrimp Causa:  Only after our 3rd visit that we were able to order this.  They have ran out of this appetizer before.  That's just how good this is.  It's supposed to be a very popular South American Appetizer.  The baked potato with the aji amarillo sauce is what makes it so yummy.  Ceviche de mixto:  This ceviche has shrimp, fish, squid, all lemon cured, mixed with onions.  There are two type of corn kernels, the sweet one, and the toasted one, both taste delicious with this ceviche.  This however, isn't the ending to this simple yet awesome dish...the sweet potato perfectly complimented this ceviche.  This was my favorite!  Anticucho de lomo:  Entree includes three types of meat on skewer: beef tenderloin, chicken, and beef heart.  I liked all 3!  They each have their own flavor.  Alfajores:  Dessert.  3 Bite-size caramel sandwich cookies.  The caramel is actually the dulce de leche.  They were coated with powdered sugar.  It is yummy, but quite expensive for the portion given.  Nevertheless, I still order it to really complete my meal.  There is this drink called chicha morada that I ordered every single time.  It's actually purple corn, but it was sweet and tart.  Super delicious.  Reminds me of grape juice, just a more peruvian authentic twist.  So refreshing.  All the times that I have been here, I've only seen one waiter.  It's a small restaurant that has room for maybe a little more than 10 tables.    Regardless, it has yummy food and I am sure to return."}
{"text":"I've been here about 6 times now, and everytime has been a great experience. The staff were friendly and made several recommendations, even explaining the regional origins of several dishes. The food is high quality, and worth the price. I know many of the ingredients are costly to order for this establishment, which is what makes it so good and fresh. I have had many of the beef dishes, chicken, and others and every one has been excellent! Go visit, you won't be sorry!   To the owners- Keep up the good work and quality of your food!"}
{"text":"So, I was in Vegas again and decided to try it again.  The ceviche was still GOOD.  Not as good as the first time but it was good.  The waitress forgot to bring an appetizer and brought me something else that I didn't order... :/ I still ate it... because I was too hungry to wait for what I originally ordered.  They had no bread at the start of my meal so I was very hungry... the wait was long.  Next time am in town I will give it another try... the food is still good just think the waitress/waiter should be a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner yesterday.. I had the Arroz con Pollo and it was the BOMB! i hadn't had chicken in a while and the flavors were right on and it wasnt greasy or dry. my fam that i was with enjoyed there food although they was some confusion with the menu.  My fam said the steak was a little dry but they are picky but IDK for sure.  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were amazing!  Peruvian Beer is good.. I only took a sip of both options.  If u want to drink something other than soda or water  The Purple Drink is  good.  (made there fresh takes 4 hours.)"}
{"text":"Delicious. You must go here. We usually go to Ta Ta, but decided to drop by Mi Peru instead. I had the white fish in lime juice that was so, so tasty and my husband had the beef soltada. The beef was juicy and very well seasoned. We had wine and beer that was also very good. Service was excellent. This was the first time I've tried Peruvian food and I love it!"}
{"text":"I was at Mi Peru Grill on Jan 23.  We were a party of around 16 people, most of whom had never had Peruvian food before.  The food was delicious, the service was prompt and polite, the restaurant clean, and nicely decorated.    We ordered different dishes, Lomo Satado, Ceviche, Papa a la Huancaina, Arroz con Mariscos, and Tallarines Verdes.  Their presentation was spotless and they all tasted great.  The Chef/Owner (Ray) took the time to say hi to us and inquire about the service and food.    I will be back again."}
{"text":"i am Peruvian, so i am picky about the Peruvian restaurants i go to. i came here a few weeks back and it was pretty good. the portions were decent enough to share with another person as well. i had the aji de gallina and ceviche mixto. the ceviche was AMAZING and it had pure, authentic flavor. the aji de gallina was ok but it was lacking some spice and authentic flavor. i was kinda upset when i ordered lucuma ice cream and they were out =[, only thing they had was mini alfajores, which were pretty good as well.  I gave it four stars because the service was fast, the staff was super friendly, and the food was enjoyable.  only downfall of the place is that the food is a bit overpriced. spice up the food a bit more, and it would be almost perfect. ill most likely come back for more food and to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"First, the positive: the shrimp ceviche was the best I've had in Las Vegas - hands down. Amazing. The cilantro chicken dish I tried was also very good.   The not-quite-so-positive: my wife's steak was overcooked and bland. Also, with an shared appetizer and entree each, it quickly turned into a $55 lunch - and we don't even drink.   Next time I think I'll just order the appetizer as my meal and I will be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and the ceviche and papa a la huancaina was very bland no real flavor and way over priced"}
{"text":"I was working in Henderson for a few months and happened to find Mi Peru via Yelp and by a local Peruvian co-worker's recommendation. I was hooked after my first meal and made a point of eating there at least once a week during my extended stay.  The restaurant is decorated in simple but good taste. It is a small family owned restaurant. Cleanliness is key for me and I always checkout the restrooms of where I dine - that always give you a good idea of what the sanitation practices of a place. The restaurant was clean and pleasant overall.  The star of place is definitely the food. In my multiple visits, there was nothing that I could say I didn't like. I am the type of person who tries to stay away from restaurants that are \"Americanized\" to suit locals' taste buds. I love the flavors authentic ethnic cuisines have to offer and Mi Peru definitely does a great job of this.  I make a point of visiting a Peruvian restaurant when I find one in whatever city I am in, and Mi Peru is one I can't stop talking about. The quality and the affordable price of the \"Tiradito\". This is a raw fish dish similar to sashimi, but differs from ceviche in the cut of the fish and lack of onions. It is typically served with sweet potato and corn with a citrus sauce. The tiradito is a must have. The second dish I love from Mi Peru is the \"Causa\" - made with mashed potatoes, canned tuna, hard boiled egg, avocado and lime juice. I would have never tried it from just reading the description on the menu but tried it since my friend had highly recommended. It was delicious. The way the flavors blended together was surprising. I made sure to order this as often as possible as well.  I tried the lomo saltado, the choros a la criolla, pollo a la brasa, ceviche and the arroz con pollo when I was with a larger group. You just couldn't go wrong with any of these dishes.  The next time I am in Vegas, I will make sure to dine in Mi Peru again even if it out of the way. Mi Peru now the restaurant I compare all Peruvian restaurants to."}
{"text":"My favorite Latin American restaurant in the Las Vegas valley.  Authentic Peruvian cuisine with its flavorful and eclectic combinations of meat, vegetables, fruit, and spices. Mi Peru is tucked away in a quiet plaza near Horizon Ridge and Stephanie. Mi Peru also serves a wide selection of South American wines and beers.  Don't forget to sample the homemade deserts.  Outstanding ethnic cooking, reasonable prices, easy access from the 215.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is amazing and the service was stellar. This is my favioret place in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing!! The food is so rich in flavor and very filling. My husband would have licked the plate if he could have. We both got different steak dishes mine had pesto spaghetti with it that had an amazing rich flavor. His reminded me of carne aside fries but with perfectly caramelized vegetables.  I can't wait to go back and try more food! Totally worth the money."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Peruvian places in California, but this place is pretty good!   We ordered the Lomo Saltado which didn't disappoint, side of plantains which I always have to get, and arroz con mariscos.   I would come back."}
{"text":"Not sure how this gem stayed under my radar for so long, but it's a straight 5* even independent of its unassuming location in Henderson in a random strip mall.  I already knew the place was a winner the first time I had the chupe de camarones (basically a seafood bisque), which was perfectly soul-warming. I'd come here just for the chupe de camarones - that's how good it is.  Otherwise, my usual go-to entree is the lomo saltado; strongly recommend getting it with tacu tacu (beans mixed with rice) instead of the standard french fries and rice. The lomo saltado is super tender and the accompanying tomatoes/onions are always perfectly cooked. Otherwise I opt for the chicarrones, and no matter what, I always try to talk my party into splitting either the chaufa especial (mixed rice with shrimp, beef, and chicken) or the arroz con marisos (something like a seafood paella).  Henderson people are super lucky to have this gem on their side of town."}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been to Mi Peru sooner than this. The three of us had an excellent meal! We were there around 5 on a Friday so it wasn't too busy yet. Our server was incredibly friendly and willing to go over the menu with us. The food was all excellent! So flavorful! Each of us started making happy noises with our first bites. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been amazing! The fish calamari mix dish is so good ,especially if you add the green sauce. Very friendly staff and convent location off Horizon Ridge."}
{"text":"Yuummm!!! I absolutely love this place! Its a small restaurant, which I like, It feels very home like and it looks cozy inside. The waiter was very nice and friendly, we told him it was our first time here and he did explain what we were getting since we weren't sure what it was exactly. I ordered the Lomo de carne. Which has seriously at that moment become my favorite food. It has meat with French fries, onions, tomatoes and comes with a side of rice. It had a yummy little juice in the meat. So yea, this place is delicious."}
{"text":"My daughter had the Peruvian fried chicken. It was cooked perfectly and was super good.  I had the Lomo Saltado. I've never had it before to compare with anything else. I really liked it. The meat was well seasoned. The portion was too big for me though.  My boyfriend had the chef special which was a fried rice with beef and shrimp. He finished his whole plate and some of mine. We'll be back since it's pretty close to home and a great variety of something different."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, I was so pleasantly surprised! We went for lunch, the owner Rhimie was our server. He was very friendly and helpful, explained all the dishes to us. Would definitely recommend this place! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We were pretty impressed with the food.  We split the ceviche (YUM) appetizer.  Perfectly tangy and flavorful.  I had seco de carne... the beef was moist and tender, and the vegetables, beans and rice were a great compliment.  He had the anticuchos combo, and the meat tasted right off the grill. We do think it's a little overpriced for the area and what you get, but it was a good meal and good service.  The music is Peruvian, but the pan flute gets a little tiresome after 45 minutes or so.  Will definitely come here again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My wife and I were greeted warmly and were seated immediately, our food took a bit longer but I must say well worth the wait at the end. Lomo Saltado and Bistek Apanado are my favorite. Could not be more satisfied , and its not too far away from where I live."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant on our way to find Settlebello in Henderson.  We were thrilled because Peruvian food is something both she and I miss tremendously.  We went in and I ordered the Arroz con pollo (Chicken rice) and she ordered the Arroz con mariscos (Seafood rice) and they both did not disappoint.  The portion of rice was generous on both plates.  Mine came with two pieces of chicken and colorfully green flavored rice.  There was some red onion salsa on the side -- it was good!  Hers had two mussels and seafood mixed into the rice...  delicious.  I recommend the passion fruit drink and a side of plantains to go with your meal.  They both compliment the meal very well!  I normally order the Bistec a lo Pobre when I'm at a Peruvian joint, so I'd have to go back and try it!  But Hurray for Peruvian food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - 3 stars - nothing outstanding, but it was clean and not too noisy, and thus is a place where you can have a conversation during your meal.  It does have some design features, but basically is a restaurant in a strip mall (a nice, clean, on the quiet side restaurant).  Service - 5 stars plus - excellent and attentive service.  The server brought out our drinks immediately, and then gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we wanted next.  She was helpful with suggestions, and actually had some passion about the food she was serving.  The best thing, and it's really a treat, is that she never was intrusive, but was always attentive.  I was surprised because I was never caught off guard, and whenever I wanted something or had a question, she was at hand without me having to gesture for attention (seriously she was almost psychic, she was that good).  Granted there were only two other tables in the restaurant at the time I ate, but still, everything was perfectly timed, extremely professional and pleasant while still being friendly.  Food - 4 stars - We started off with yucca root and a creamy sauce reminiscent of hollandaise.  It was reminiscent of potato (only not quite) and the flavors was quite subtle and enjoyable.  The yucca root was perfectly cooked (crispy but not greasy exterior, and soft interior), and the sauce was subtle enough to allow you to appreciate the distinction between yucca and potato.   The main courses were Arroz con Mariposa and Lomo Saltado.  The Arroz con Mariposa had a delightful flavor that was subtly spiced.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, though the shrimp and mussels were slightly overcooked (maybe a minute too long?  just enough to notice but not enough to make you want to stop eating!).  Overall a satisfying experience that played on the taste-buds.  The Lomo Saltado was uniquely seasoned and in a beautiful way.  Flavor wise, it was excellent, but sadly the meat was slightly overcooked.  Again, it was a situation where the overcooking was noticeable but the overall flavors were such that it outweighed any real complaint.  My favorite thing about the Lomo Saltado was the cilantro aftertaste which I don't usually associate with beef.  It was pleasant and hearty.  Dessert was Ice cream lucuma with Nazca Lines.  Iucuma is a fruit from Peru, which is a bit hard to describe, but overall the dessert was wonderful and not too sweet.  My only regret was that i think the dessert could have paired perfectly with a cup of hot green tea.  The dessert presentation was beautiful with decorative nazca reminiscent lines on the plate.  Drink - 3 stars - Purple corn drink.  It's spicy in a mulled wine sort of way, refreshing in an iced tea sort of way, and overall a unique, pleasant experience that truly enhances the spices of the meal. I noticed they do have a smaller than normal drink selection, but do include several import beers (I stuck with the purple corn drink, because it was good!).  Recommendations - The yucca root with the creamy sauce was excellent, as was everything else we tried.  I particularly liked the seafood paella taste of the Arroz con Mariposa, but also enjoyed the Lomo Saltado with it's surprising aftertastes.  Definitely I recommend getting the Purple Corn Drink to go with any meal you choose.  Avoid - I wouldn't say avoid anything, but perhaps suggest the chef undercook some foods compared to normal.  The spices and flavors will be mild and subtle, so overall not much to avoid here."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Peruvian restaurants. I'm Peruvian and I can say that the food tastes just as if I was in Peru. My boyfriend goes here all the time, and the service is good too! Their seco de carne con frijoles and arroz con pollo are very very good. They have dishes that you usually do not find at other Peruvian restaurants, which makes this place unique."}
{"text":"Do not go there. Not worth your time, money or calories. First time not good their rice tasted like fast chinese food and they didn't have grilled chicken for which Peruvian food is mostly know for. Gave them a second chance, no papa rellena, again no chicken. Service is slow, non-courteous and food was bland compared to other Peruvian food I've had in other cities. They better make things better if they want to survive here."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, different flavors, good for a change from the sacrosanct trinity Italian-Chinese-Mexican (that I love by the way). We tried the Papa Rellena, a meat stuffed deep fried potato, common to other Latino cuisines; very good. The Aji de Gallina, shredded curry chicken with potato and rice, was also very good. This was during the lunch special, and the only downer was the size of the servings, on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Lomo saltado is on point. Ali sauce is yummy. Has just enough kick. Gustavo was a great server. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to dine in at Mi Peru, but I ordered take-out through Bite Squad. I ordered the Anticucho de Lomo (beef tenderloin kabobs with fried potatoes) and Aguadito de Pollo (soup with chicken, rice, cilantro, carrots, and potato). My food arrived hot and very well packaged.   The Anticucho de Lomo was good, but not one of the best meals I've had. The beef was seasoned and slightly tender. The fried potatoes didn't have any flavor, but the spicy green sauce that came with it made them quite tasty. The portion seemed small for the price.  The Aquadio de Pollo was very tasty. It reminded me of a step up from the normal chicken noodle soup since it had cilantro and rice instead of noodles. The rice, chicken, potatoes, and carrots were plentiful in this soup. There was enough soup for two people and it was a generous portion for the price.  Looking at the menu online I wonder if maybe I just didn't choose the most exciting items. I think I'll have to try dining at the restaurant in the near future to see if I like it more."}
{"text":"Food was good. It was our first time here. We ordered Civeche for appetizer and I had Chaufa Rice for dinner. We will come back again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Tony was great explaining all the varieties and styles of foods on the menu, since it was our first time trying South American food.  I had the Seco de Carne and hubby had the Tacu Tacu con Saltado, along with fried Plantains and then a wonderful coconut Flan for desert. All seasoned perfectly and enough food for another dinner later. Great experience, really had fun and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Actually a really great little Shop the food here is different and also very tasty. I highly recommend the beef with the cilantro rice absolutley fantastic. Prices are a bit higher for a little Shop like this so expect to pay for the food but it is well worth it I haven't eaten much Peruvian fare but I really like the idea of it sweet succulent beef meats and tangy spicy chicken like I said before the cilantro rice is fantastic the veggies are cooked perfectly soft so thay don't lose to much flavor if you are on this side of town or looking for a new spot to order some takeout absolutely give this place a shit you won't regret it I promise. One downside is that the delivery does take quite some time compared to the other restaurants In The area."}
{"text":"This review is about a month overdue.    Experience:  Came with a group of folks to try something different.  Was looking forward to it, since I never had Peruvian food before. There was about 10 of us and we came at lunch time.   Service:  The staff was still setting up when we came in, but were very helpful when we needed anything.   Food:  They put down some corn nut type munchies that have a nice spicy green sauce that I just loved.  I had a Peruvian friend who told me to try the Papa A La Huancaina. It was good, but a little rich. It was almost like a hollandaise sauce over boiled potato slices.  Then we had the Yuquitas Fritas, and they reminded me of potatoes...maybe just a bit bland with some good sauce to dip it in.  My main course was the Chicharrones.  It was roast pork with fried sweet potato slices and a hominy salad on the side.  I liked this dish, especially the pork.   Facility:  The restaurant was a quaint little place that was kinda long and not wide. It sat our group fairly well.  It did have some Peruvian flair to the atmosphere with the decor.   Overall:  this place was good, but not amazing.  I would come back with friends, but since it's out of the way, it will not be anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is the most consistent place I've been too.  We used to go here a lot as it was right around the corner from where we used to live.  Each and every time, your food tastes exactly the same as it did the last time.    It's been a while since I've been back here, since moving I've tried a few other places closer to my house and nothing compares to this place.  The service is good the food is amazing and it's worth the short drive to come back here.  The beans & rice has an amazing taste like no other place.  Everything here is fresh, from the ceviche to the Flan it is worth it.  I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"I want to give this place six stars because it's so good, but I apparently don't have that option. Sucks.   I love this place, guys. I really do. They have really good food here, and it's truly the best Peruvian food I've had in Las Vegas, on par with El Rocoto in California. Not only that, but it's nice to go to a Peruvian place that has a real restaurant feel to it - some Peruvian places are a little bit more dumpy, where this place is really dressed up. Win for this place, my friends. But I won't bore you with details of the decor (it's tasteful), the staff (friendly and polite), or parking (plentiful!). Let's talk food.   The food here is great. That's all there is to it. Please, please, please listen to me when I recommend that you get the jalea for your party. Trust me. It's so good it'll knock your socks off. Plus, the dish is huge! I order that just so that my date/family/whomever-I'm-eating-with eats that and leaves my plate alone. Plus, the red diced onions?! I could eat those as a dish.   Whatever you eat, you need to drink chicha. It's a purple maiz drink, which makes it sound gross. Except it's the exact opposite of gross! It's an epic win! If you're not feeling that adventurous, try the Inca Kola. My non-Peruvian friends tell me it tastes like bubblegum, though I say it tastes like happiness. Also, try the lucuma ice cream. I really have no way of telling you how good this is, other than to tell you it's amazing.   Everything here is good. The lomo saltado, ceviche, jalea... everything. It's really good food! I'm trying to think of more things to say that will tell you how good it is, but I can't. Because my work schedule was nuts for a while, I haven't been here in forever. I need to come back here soon, so you'll probably see me here when you come!"}
{"text":"Can't believe it's almost been a year since we had been there.  Once again we enjoyed a great late lunch with excellent service If your searching for a great alternative to Mexican....It's right here We won't wait so long next time.  Ciao"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it is okay, average, nothing spectacular... The service is really good...The waiter explains the popular menu items and goes through everything, even the specialty drinks.  You get bread and a cilantro-esque dipping sauce.  One of the two times, I also got pickled veggies. I got the lomo saltado on trip one, a beef stirfry with fries and rice...it is good, enough food for 2 meals, but slightly oily.  Tastes good reheated!  The second time, I got the bistec - steak with grilled onions (big chunks), tomatoes, rice, fries and plantains with a fried egg on top.  I did have to ask for the plaintains as they were forgotten, but when I got them they were hot, sweet and delicious.  The fried egg is a nice touch. The prices are high (approximately $16 for a dish) but it is worth trying a new cuisine.  I think each entree could feed a normal person of either gender for dinner and lunch the next day.  I just don't think my two experiences and the experience of my new-to-Peruvian-food dining companion warrant another trip."}
{"text":"Ordered arroz con mariscos, which was some of the best I have tasted. Great friendly service and good location just outside of Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Simple yet lovely decor, very welcoming...   We went here for a friend's birthday gathering and everyone at the table would probably give their dish 4-5 stars. The food here is absolutely fantastic... very authentic and hearty. The portions are ideal and there is something on the menu for everyone.   The server recommended an amazing dish for me and was attentive the entire time we were there. I had the fried fish with shrimp sauce and rice but was also able to try their steak, rice, beef skewers, and variety of seafood. Needless to say, I enjoyed every bite :). I highly recommend going here and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is fun and unique - plus yummy!  The whole family liked what we ordered.  I had fried pork and yams my girls both loved the chicken and steak with rice and a soy sauce - I definitely felt like I was back in South America.  I was surprised at how quite it was but as it got later, more customers strolled in.  I think the restaurant must get busier as it gets later in the evening.    Looking for something unique but easy to get in and out?  Try Mi Peru."}
{"text":"let me begin by saying this was the first time I've ever had Peruvian food and it was amazing. The fish ceviche was amazing, both of our meals were delicious. I stumbled on this place through restaurant.com and i will def be going back. Really great food, not like Mexican food at all which i don't like, so if your in the area go there!"}
{"text":"The food was \"OK\". It has great reviews so we decided to try it out. We had some tuna with mash potatoe appetizer sprinkled with raw onions and a green sauce.  That was good! The steak and plantains were pretty greasy and it actually made my stomach hurt for a couple days. I don't think I'd recommend this just cause if the grease but if you can handle it then it's a must try."}
{"text":"The food was authentic and delicious, they were out a cook when my family and I came in. Although we had to wait 45 minutes just to be seated/served...the food was worth it"}
{"text":"This small, informal restaurant serves Peruvian fare - duh.  We started off with a complimentary salad of jicama, carrots, cucumber and onion in lime juice and a cup of aji dipping sauce.  This salad proved to be both spicy, refreshing and the best dish we consumed this evening.  Our shared appetizer was papa a la huancaina - boiled potatoes covered with a mild aji sauce and cream.  I could not taste the aji sauce and the overall flavor was muted.  I also tried a glass of chica morado - a purple corn drink which was pretty good though it won't be replacing diet Pepsi at Hacienda de Westie.  Ann ordered arroz con Mariscos - a mixed seafood dish with rice billed as being Peru's take on paella.  I settled on a mixed seafood soup called parihucla that the menu described as Peru's take on bouillabaisse.  Both entrees were bland and compared unfavorably to their better known counterparts."}
{"text":"Roasted Corn with Spicy Aji Sauce: This is placed at your table to snack on. The roasted corn is amazing. A bit difficult to dip in the aji, but so great together. Also, the aji sauce really packed a kick, yow!  Causa de Pollo ($9.95): Classic Peruvian appetizer of mashed potato layers, stuffed with chicken salad, and a mild aji sauce. Served with boiled egg, and pickled red onion. The potatoes are really creamy and go so well with the chicken salad mixture. The pickled red onion provides the perfect balance to this creamy dish.  Yuquitas Fritas ($8.95): Fried yucca root with Peruvian dipping sauce. I love yucca root! The dipping sauce was creamy and delicious. We loved mixing it with the spicy aji sauce.  Bistec a lo Pobre ($17.95): Beef steak with grilled onion, fries, white rice, fried plantain, and fried egg. Very similar to the popular Lomo Saltado, except this dish doesn't have tomato and is served with fried sweet plantain and fried egg. The beef was flavorful and tender. Everything was delicious, though I didn't care for the fried plantain in this combination.  Tallarines Verdes con Carne ($15.95): Thin steak with pesto spaghetti. Again, the steak was great. The pasta was just okay for me.  Great spot to try Peruvian specialties. Everything was great and service was fantastic. They were so accommodating."}
{"text":"food is excellent and service is superb. we had the arroz con mariscos (like spanish paella or like a seafood risotto, in a way) and chicharrones (fried pork)."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great service, authentic Peruvian food! Why are you still reading this? Go to mi Peru! :p"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check Mi Peru out for lunch today. It's a nice place and their service was pretty good. I haven't had too much experience with Peruvian food but I enjoyed my meal here. I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was tasty. I had the Estofado de Pollo, which is chicken stewed in tomato sauce with potatoes, and it comes with some steamed rice. My friend had the Seco de Carne, which is stewed beef in a cilantro sauce, served with potatoes, rice and beans. I tried the beef and it was VERY tender. The flavor was also pretty good. The portions are pretty big, so we didn't have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Ordered the peruvian fried chicken 4 piece Tasted pretty delicious. I  enjoyed the seasoning and fried perfectly leaving a nice tender taste.  French fries was abundant for 4 pieces. What I didn't like about this place was they didn't serve the bread with the green chili salsa. They served kernals instead. Also they charged for refills.  My fiance ordered the mariscos con arroz and she loved it! I also like all the Peruvian decorations also."}
{"text":"Came in here with a group of three and one peruvian.  I thought the food was excellent, but more important he thought the food was excellent.  It was later in the evening so there weren't many people there but the service was excellent.  Expect to spend around $12-17 per person but it is worth it if you like Peruvian food.   I had the Anticucho De Corazon which is beef kabobs with fried potatoes and a side of corn.  The corn was amazing, not sure where they get it.  It isn't a ton of food but it is good quality.    If I lived in the area I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I guess our complaints are getting attention. I gave this place one more shot and the service was a big improvement. I moved it up from 1 star to 3. I'm not to happy with the new changes in recipes though:( the arroz con polo was great but the causa w/shrimp was so much better with chopped shrimp, smaller Pieces of onion, no olive sprinkled into it and where did my egg go? Also the anticucho de lomo seasoning seemed to have changed:( I was happy to see they had domestic beer this time."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how wonderful the peruvian cuisine is here. Actually, I can. I went to this place because I live very close by. I didn't expect much when walking in. Decor is cool, but it was not busy at all which worried me. We asked the waiter what his fave dish was and he said the Lomo Saltado. I ordered it and fell in love the minute the food touched my lips. It's quality beef strips, sauteed with white onions and sliced tomoatoes. It is cooked in a vinegar/beer marinade and tossed with french fries. My husband got the Milanesa. It is breaded steak with a side of a beautiful pesto pasta. We haven't tried any seafood here but that happens to be one of their specialties. This place is perfect for a date night, or bringing family to for a night of great food."}
{"text":"Arroz con pollo was spicy and tasty. Tender chicken on the bone. Fun rhythmic tunes played while we dined. Atmosphere is ok. I would come back for this dish. 3 and a half stars. Cool to get something different and experience something new. My guess is most dishes here are solid."}
{"text":"We went in here again last night for dinner, and once again, I was surprised to see it so dead.  There were maybe 2 other tables the entire time we were there.  It's so cute, the service is great, and best of all, the food is amazing.  We ordered the ceviche and this tuna thing.  OMG, the tuna thing is melt in your mouth delicious.  The ceviche, as always, was on point.  This is really the best ceviche I've ever had from any restaurant.    Next came the combo anticuchos with shrimp instead of beef hearts because...well, I'm just not into beef hearts.  We also ordered the lomo tallarin saltado but this time it came with the wider fettucini style noodles instead of the spaghetti style noodles.  I'm not sure why, but this makes such a huge difference in this dish.  It was so good!  I daresay it's on par with Little Dumplings now.  The last dish we got was the Chauffa Esecial - Peruvian fried rice.  So good!  They had a special on a bottle of Gauchos Malbec, which tasted exactly as it was described to us.  It was the perfect pairing for the perfect meal.  Mi Peru is a true hidden gem and I hope more people get attuned to it because it would be a shame if it closed down."}
{"text":"I lived in Peru for a year and I have to say that Peruvian food is one of my favorites. My favorite dish in Peru was the lomo saltado with tacu tacu and I was glad to see that this restaurant serves this dish. I like my lomo saltado medium well and I am used to it being served with potatoes, onions and tomatoes. The version made at this restaurant did not have the potatoes and the meat was cooked well done.  The dish per se was good. The flavors were there and the portion was big. I took some home because of how much food I was served. I wish my portion was smaller and that the dish was more affordable. It is one of the priciest dishes in the menu.   I did like that they had Peruvian beer like Cusqueña and Cristal. They are my faves :). Overall, this is a place I would come back to when I am craving Peruvian food."}
{"text":"i went to this place cause its close to my house.  Fook is ok.  Service could be better.  I would try again and see, might be their off night."}
{"text":"I am from LA, and my favorite peruvian restaurants there are Mario's and El Rocoto. Those are the best peruvian restaurants in LA. So when I came upon Mi Peru, I just had to try it. I am proud to say I have found a place in Las Vegas, my second home, that satisfies my LOMO SALTADO with lots of AJI (green sauce) cravings. I can't wait to go back, and try the rest of the things on their menu. I'm a tough critic when it comes to peruvian food, especially since my boyfriend is peruvian. I learned from the best :)"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and this is by far the worst place in Vegas. First time they completely forgot one of our meals but whatever we still went back because the food was decent and it was close. I called and made reservations and specifically said I need a high chair. When we got there they told us we need to wait thirty minutes despite our reservation because they took a big party. They were not even apologetic. So then I was like fine can I get a high chair they said on no we gave it to the big party... I told them I called ahead stating I need one and they said yea well we gave it to someone else. We just left they did nothing to even try to accommodate. Only go here if you want to be treated badly. Worst place in Las Vegas hands down including dives... You'll get better service at a 24 hour hole in he wall filled with smoke and the food is not that great... Over priced beans and rice."}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant with a pretty good atmosphere.  I hadn't eaten Peruvian food for about 10 years, so I was long overdue!  This was more of an mid to upscale place compared to my usual Peruvian haunt (El Pollo Inca in LA).  I had to ask for the green spicy Aji sauce and it came in a bowl with a spoon (instead of a clear squirt bottle :P ).  We had the \"Peruvian Seafood Paella\" dish and the Arroz con Pollo.  The portions were quite large and everything tasted great and was very flavorful.  The only thing I regret was not getting something with rice and fries mixed in...  Miss that stuff!"}
{"text":"Stormy and I checked out this place a few days ago. I have to say that I'm a bit shocked that I seem to be a closet Peruvian cuisine fan. I've been impressed with every Peruvian place I've visited in the past few years (from Panama to Kentucky and now Nevada). MPSAG did not disappoint. We were tired from a day of driving when we found this place (Thanks Yelp! for another good recommendation). Started off with Peruvian beer and this was good too. We tried the Chaufa Especial. On the menu they liken it to fried rice but for me it was much closer to a good Southern Jambalaya than Chinese. Hearty rice filled with meats and shrimp. No skimping here. One of the most filling an satisfying platter style dishes I've had in years. Sadly, my biggest regret about this place is that I won't get to explore the huge selection on the menu or the specials. What you get when you stumble on someplace during a roadtrip. I know its a little out of the way in Henderson but it's well worth hunting down. I'd only go if I was hungry as there is too much good food here."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you feel like you are walking into the humid rain forests of Peru, but that's because their air conditioning is not working or is off LOL!  Today, my friend and I came to Mi Peru for our lunch.    Ambiance- I haven't been to Peru but I think this restaurant embodies what I would expect to see in Peru. Lots of wood carvings, Latin prints and what seemed like an Alpaca fur rug. One of their walls is made of ply wood with its original \"Home Depot\" stamping...how vintage! LOL Their bathrooms are single stall bathrooms and seems clean enough.  They have a couple of TVs playing the game and the servers are dressed in black button downs and slacks with a long apron.   Food- I ordered the chicharrones for $11.95.  As stated on the menu, it's a traditional Peruvian dish, crispy and tender pork chunks. Served with salsa criolla and yams, which I've substituted with rice.  I could tell the rice was cooked in some kind of broth, because there was a lot of flavor.  The chunks of pork was super tender and was really marbleized.  I think that's a really good thing!  I also think they used cumin because there was a smokey taste to it.  Wasn't a lot of salt so I added some.  Later I discovered that the salsa, a combo of red onions and tomatoes, was to be eaten together and brought an insane combination with the pork.  My friend who had the yams instead of the rice seemed to really enjoy it as well.    All in all, the server was really pleasant and very efficient since we told him we were on our lunch break.  I had a great first impression of the place and will be returning to Mi Peru to try other dishes :)"}
{"text":"I've seen this place for about 9 years before I ever decided to try it and wished I wouldn't have waited so long. But since my first visit I've been back several times.  The food: The first time I tried the Lomo Saltado (steak stir fried with tomatoes, onions and French fries) and wow, that was delicious. My mother used to make this same dish when I was young but I didn't realize that it was a Peruvian dish. I put 2 and 2 together and realized she had learned to make it from a Peruvian friend she had. That brought me back to my childhood in a big way. My girlfriend ordered the same dish and she just loves it and orders it every time. Since then I've ordered the Seco do Carne, which the meat is so tender and tasty, and I've also ordered the chicken and rice, muy eccellente.  The place: Its a small to average sized restaurant in a strip mall with Peruvian decor. It's always clean and decorated nicely. There's always people dining but never super busy that you have to wait. There is music playing and although not South American music it is still nice. I wish they had some outdoor seating for those days when the weather is perfect. There is a great area right outside that they could utilize if the landlord and finances would permit.   The service: I've only see one waiter there, Antonio. Probably because we tend to go at the same time every time. He is very friendly and on the spot with everything."}
{"text":"Living 600 miles away from my grandma's home cooking, this place sure fills a void in my life. As close to her cooking as I can find here. Pretty authentic and fills your tummy. The best Peruvian food I have ever eaten (aside from my grandma's of course) is right here!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm kinda surprised that Mi Peru has such high ratings! It was my first time trying Peruvian food and I'm still a little undecided about it.  FOOD: - lomo saltado (but with fish!) - I don't eat beef so we asked to substitute it with fish and they did! This was very very good and HUGE portions! - chauffa de pollo - this basically tasted like chicken fried rice. Quite disappointed in this. We ended up combining both dishes to make our own! :)  SERVICE: Extremely friendly! Mi Peru was SO DEAD when we came here on a Friday night. There were two other couples eating but it was very very quiet. There seemed to only be one lady but she came to check in on us several times and was very friendly and nice.  I'd definitely give Peruvian food another try but not sure if it will be back at Mi Peru."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. We just moved to Henderson from N Phx & this was one of the 1st restaurants we tried as it is literally steps from our house. I was a little bummed that the Pollo A La Brasa wasn't available when we were there (only Thurs-Sun) but after the meal we had, I knew we'd be back so I was excited to try it in the future.   I ordered the Arroz con Mariscos ($15.95) which was delicious & HUGE. It was filled with plenty of seafood that was perfectly cooked. I asked for a little bit of their Aji sauce to try out since I make it at home regularly & it is one of my favorite condiments. I put it on almost everything! It was very good & spicy although the mayo flavor was pretty strong.   My husband ordered the Tallarines Verdes ($14.95) which was equally huge & very tasty.   The wait for our food was a little on the slow side but that wasn't a concern for us. We had no where to go & it was nice to sit & talk while we waited for our food. The only reason I mention it, is that if you are an impatient person or in a rush to be somewhere else, this might not be the best choice for you. Save it for a time when you can go & enjoy a leisurely night out.   I was a little sad to see only one other table occupied while we there & I really hope this place sticks around. SO happy to have a great dining option so close to us.. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was originally very nervous coming here due to the fact that my boyfriend loves to horrify me about peruvians eating guinea pig.   However... for my more conservative people out there ...do not be afraid.   I was completely blown away with how awesome everything was. Sure ...certain entrees cost a little more... around 20.  But the amount of food they give you is insane. Its like ordering two orders at a normal place. The rest of the menu is completely within range of normal food prices.  I had beef kabobs and my boyfriend had a giant seafood platter. Everything was cooked to perfection and the quality was amazing. Love that the food is spiced well, different, and tasty.  They have healthier options as well as fried stuff when youre in the mood to be a fatty.   The place itself is really welcoming. We showed up 10 minutes before closing and the staff were really nice and did not make us feel like an obligation. They gave us things to snack on while we waited for our take out and had some beers. I never once felt rushed. Even though we showed up 10 minutes before closing on a monday, the food was made to order and did not taste like we'd been given the leftover scraps of the day.   I Cant wait to try other things on the menu!!  Seriously. GO HERE"}
{"text":"I have never experienced a business owner so determined to maintain the reputation of his business. After my negative yelp review I was very pleasantly surprised when my issue was resolved so professionally and i was treated like a valuable customer. I know every business makes mistakes but as long as they handle it like this restaurant owner did i would gladly remain a Customer as i am with mi peru. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We are going back on Friday!!!!  So after trying Peruvian food for the first time in San Bernardino Ca at (El Rico Pollo) The food was amazedly delicious! I couldn't wait to get back home and look for a peruvian restaurant in my home town Las Vegas. So after reading a few reviews I found \"Mi Peru\" and all I kept thinking oh please let the ceviche de pescado taste the same from the other place I first went to and it did! All the flavors were the same except that the other place it was much spicier and I LOVE spicy food. Maybe I can request it much spicier when I am there Friday. The food and the service was excellent!! Btw our waiter had the most Beautiful eyes! :P"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. So far, the Loma Saltado is my favorite, but I'll be trying the Pescado Sudado next time. Nice, quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years. Since it opened. Today I had planned a going away lunch for a good friend of mine. When I got there at 1130 the restaurant was not open. I sat outside for a few minutes getting ready to call the number and a gentleman walked out and told me that the kitchen was not clean, they didn't have food ready and that they weren't going to be open for a while. I explained to him at the time is 11 o'clock on the door. He then told me that they were very busy yesterday and they are busy cleaning. Very unapologetic and bothered. What a disappointment and what a poor way to handle business. You lost a very good customer."}
{"text":"Having been living off dennys and fast food for 3 days I was dying for something to curb my foodie cravings. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I like Peruvian food and was hoping it was as good as the place I go to back home.   Well, I came here for lunch at around 2pm and the place was empty. never a good sign. We sat down and got menus and the prices were shocking. Plates ran anywhere from $11 to $16. No way am I going to pay that much for Peruvian food at lunch time. And they only have Pollo ala Brasa after 4pm?? thats that all about? needless to say I left without eating."}
{"text":"Missing a home cooked meal?Try this place out here located in Henderson. If you are craving authentic Peruvian food that is mom and pop atmosphere, you can check this place out.   Menu has a lot to choose from. Most of the prices on the menu can range from $9-23 depending if it is meat or seafood. If you have not tried Peruvian food before, I would suggest Lomo Saltado (beef, onions, tomatoes, and french fries w/side of white rice) for your entree or the rotesseri chicken (you can choose from 2 pcs ($9) or the 4 pcs ($14) depending on how hungry you are). The chicken comes w/a huge plate of fries. This will give your mouth a little taste of what Peruvian food has to offer.  What we ordered: fiance had the 4 pcs of rotesseri chicken w/fries. As for me, I ordered the Arroz Con Mariscos  (rice with seafood (scallops, mussels, shrimps, and octopus and veggies (peas and carrots)). We also received complimentary salad for the both of us to share.  The food was phenomenal. Rotesseri chicken came out juicy, evenly seasoned and not dry. I was in awe just with one bite. Use the special green sauce that adds a little spice to add the wow factor. Fries of plate, I hope you love them! They give you a whole plate . The arroz con Mariscos, was bomb. It had moistness, fresh, and the seafood still had the proper balance and taste. To drink try their traditional corn drink or passion fruit. This will add sweetness to your meal. Want to go all out, the also serve wine direct from Peru or beer.   All in all, we came out with happy tummys and satisfied. Will definitely come back to taste other platters on the menu."}
{"text":"Supper yummy food!  My friends and I tried an assortment of dishes. We had the papa a huancaina. It was okay, a bit cold. My friend has the pollo saltado and it was so full of yummy veggies and fries! Another friend got the fried chicken and was soooooo gooood. I had the anticucho de lomo and it was so tender and the potatoes were super crispy. We also had desert. It was like a cheesecake custard thing. So glad to have tried a new type of cuisine. Cozy ambience, and stellar service."}
{"text":"I cannot say I have ever eaten Peruvian food or maybe I just can't distinguish it from other Spanish influenced foods. I am not a fan of foods covered in thick sauces unless it is a curry, so I stuck to arroz con pollo, which leads me back to my first statement. I eat this dish when I go to Cuban restaurants, so I might not have gotten a true taste of Peru. Of course, I got a side of fried plantains, but for $4.50 I have received a more satisfying amount at other establishments. I can eat these sweet treats by the truckload, so I was rather disappointed.   The arroz con pollo was delicious. My favorite item on the plate were the onions, in a citrus dressing, instead of the chicken or rice. I ended up eating all of it to refresh my palate after every bite of the rice. The chicken was moist, but a little on the bland side. The rice was really flavorful, but a little greasy. I would have also liked it if it came with a side of black beans, but it didn't. I guess I have always come to expect a plate to come with rice, beans, plantains, chicken and onions.   The serving size was large. I packed half of it to take home. I would go back, but I will do my research so that I can claim to have an authentic experience next time."}
{"text":"Great food, good beer. It was really nice to have South American food while staying here in Henderson, it tasted almost just like when I was in Peru. Only complaint here would be the check that took a little long to get to the table."}
{"text":"Yums! Planned to eat here upon arrival in Henderson, NV the night before the 25th Las Vegas Bowl. Let's go Aztecs! As expected, the food is fantastic. Ordered the Ceviche de Pescado (pictured) I have to stop writing this review and eat the ceviche before my husband gobbles it all up. Also devoured the Yuquitas Fritas before moving on to entrees, Tallarines Verdes con carne (pictured) and  Arroz con mariscos. Residents in this area should become regulars, if not already. Passing through, definately worth stopping by for the best Latin Cuisine."}
{"text":"Peruvian cuisine is something I have limited knowledge and experience, but I'm definitely open to eating more especially since what I have eaten at Mi Peru has been delicious. I've been here multiple times for dinner, but I've most recently come for lunch and the specials.  It's a small restaurant in the strip mall on the northwest corner of Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. Most likely the owner, Raymi, will be present to greet you and provide service for your meal. Always friendly, and eager to provide suggestions, he'll help you find something to your liking. The menu is filled with traditional Peruvian takes on proteins of chicken, beef, and seafood also using ingredients like yucca, plantains, yams, and the aji chili to compliment those proteins.  Lunch specials are $8.95 and come with a cup of soup. You'll get some corn nuts with an aji sauce to snack on when you first sit down. Be careful, there's no subtlety with that aji chili, it'll hit you right away. I've had the arroz con pollo and the aji de gallina on my most recent visits for lunch. The former dish had a nicely cooked, flavorful chicken thigh, but a  ton of rice (get this dish if you're looking to carbo load). The aji de gallina consisted of chicken breast with a spicy cream sauce and steamed rice, definitely my favorite of the two. Other dishes I've had in the past that I've been pleased with were the ceviche de pescado and the lomo saltado.  Prices are slightly elevated and service has been consistent. With Latin and Asian influences, Mi Peru can be a nice change of pace from your regular dining rotation and may be worth a visit to discover something new."}
{"text":"We have been there couple of times.  The foods are delicious but just long wait.  The Peruvian wine is bliss!! Love it.  I haven't tried their lunch special yet. But we shall go there one day.  Very nice set up inside and clean.  They need more business.. Anyone coming out to Henderson come try mi Peru in a nice and quiet plaza."}
{"text":"Came here during a weekday around 1pm. It's located in a quiet strip mall in Henderson. It's really all about the location. If they were located off a busier street, like south eastern, they'd be booming! S eastern has soooooo many mediocre restaurants that are always packed (Ahem egg works, pho mailan); this place is actually really good but there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, which was sad.   I got the chicken and rice lunch special (don't judge). It was delicious, though the chicken serving was slightly small. When asked about it the server got defensive rather than asking how he could make it better. Other than that, the server was very nice and helpful. He read out and translated all the specials (it was like 8-10 things).   The chicken was just a small leg and thigh, but it was juicy, delicious, and I am so glad it was dark meat (I am a dark meat gal, no innuendo intended! ;)). There was a ton of fried rice though, maybe two+ cups (that's a ton of rice, a typical serving is one cup). The Peruvian fried rice had peas and carrots in it and tasted like the rice was cooked in chicken stock. both the chicken and rice was really flavorful.   My mom got the chicken soup which she liked but the broth was made from store bought chicken stock (so not homemade chicken stock).   What I didn't like was that I saw that the lunch specials came with soup, but we weren't offered any soup. I didn't have the energy to put up a fuss, so we didn't ask about it.   Our meal came with a small serving of fried corn kernels with aji sauce (basically a spicy cilantro sauce, theirs was awesome).  4 stars because it seemed like they were trying to save $ due to the low customer turnout. Hence the small chicken pieces and the defensive response, the store bought chicken stock, and the lack of soups with our lunch specials. But the food is delicious, service is good, and I'd hate to see this place go under!"}
{"text":"Mi peru my dish is the Lomo Saltado....Peruvian food it was very very good....didn't know what this was going to be like but it was very flavorful.."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but better late than never.  Despite arriving last minute without reservations and with about a hour left before closing (restaurant was empty and was getting a mop-down), our server was super friendly and didn't make us feel rushed at all. He took the time to ask us questions as to what Peruvian dishes I've had in the past and made recommendations of his favorite dishes. Our food arrived pretty quickly, giving us ample time to drink, eat and talk story without feeling rushed.   LOMO SALTADO ($15.95):  http://bit.ly/2z4NEzY Generous cuts of tender sirloin, onions and tomatoes stir-fried with soy sauce, red wine vinegar and cumin. Not only was it served over crispy fries, steamed white rice was also included. This is my usual go-to dish and Mi Peru didn't disappoint.  TALLERINES VERDES CON CARNE ($15.95):  http://bit.ly/2zkYBOB The steak is marinated in the same soy-based sauce used for the Lomo Saltado dish. Juicy and cooked to a perfect med rare. The pasta is not your usual pesto. Aside from the usual basil and parmesan, I also tasted spinach and red onions (or shallots). The luscious pesto sauce (tasted like milk or cream was used) coated the al dente pasta evenly, not overdressed, just the perfect amount.  PERUVIAN FRIED CHICKEN (2 pc for $10.95, 4 pc for $14.95): Ordered the 2-pc and got a huge leg quarter along with crispy french fries.  http://bit.ly/2hpOcGO The marinade could've used more salt or soy sauce but you could definitely taste the cumin and paprika. There were some crispy edges but overall it seemed more like a roasted chicken dish rather than fried, still tasty though. Absent was the zesty cilantro sauce that usually accompanies this chicken dish.   ARROZ CON MARISCOS ($17.95):  http://bit.ly/2xDteui The menu listed it as a \"Peruvian Paella\" with octopus, calamari and oysters but I guess they were all out of some ingredients because ours just came with shrimp, calamari and 2 mussels. It was basically fried rice with seafood, just fluffy rice, absent of that creamy paella finished with a flavorful socorrat crust on the bottom. Not bad, but nothing spectacular either.  CHICHARRON DE CALAMARES ($14.95):  http://bit.ly/2z5Itjk You all know I can't resist ordering fried calamari if it's on the menu! These were well seasoned and the thin coating of batter gave it a fantastic crunch. Lots of crispy tentacles (my fav part) to go around.  Served with fries and a fresh onion salad.   So glad my Henderson friends introduced me to one of their favorite eats while I was in town, great friendly service and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Place was empty, we were the only ones there. Everything on the menu is pricey so I ordered plátanos and they were good. My husband got Arroz con mariscos and it was very spicy. Service was good but we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We really wanted to give this place a chance to become our neighborhood restaurant. So we decided to give it a try and went there today: According to Yelp it closes at 9pm (which is quite early for my taste), so we rushed and arrived there at 8.15. But the attendant didn't seem to be happy to welcome new guests and immediately told us in a flabbergasted way that they close actually at 8.30. We didn't feel like eating there anymore and decided to go to Tokyo Boys instead."}
{"text":"I ate here ages ago and forgot to review this.  We came here equipped with a restaurant.com certificate ready to try some Peruvian food for the first time ever.  I didn't realize until we got here that the certificate needed us to spent $50, and if you ever go here you will realize that is difficult for two people without ordering a huge banquet of food.  The prices are very very low with huge portions.  I had heard that the weekend house specialty, Pollo a la Brasa, was really good and wanted to try it.  It is supposed to be available after 2pm Thursday through Sunday, and we went on a Friday at 5pm.  They said it was not available and they were still cooking it, and I was really sad because I have been looking forward to trying it for awhile.    Instead, since we had to spend 50 bucks, I looked for the most expensive entree, Jalea Mi Perú, which is an insane amount of deep fried seafood with onions.  It was one of the biggest plates of fried food I have ever seen in my life and I could barely dent it.  My husband ordered Tacu Tacu con Lomo Saltado, which is beef tenderloin sauteed with tomato and onion.  It had some beans and rice \"cake\" like mixture that I thought was very tasty, but my husband is not adventurous and did not touch it.  Otherwise he enjoyed his dish.  Also we split a hearty chicken soup and some plantains as an appetizer.  The chicken soup was one of the best soups we've had.  When I feel sick I might come here just to pick up this soup if matzo ball soup isn't available.  The check came out to 20ish with the certificate.  It was very reasonable, but next time I would get a lower denomination certificate, maybe $10.  It was just way too much food."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with great service. More people need to come and try this place.   We ordered the ceviche and the lomos saltado. Both were made beautifully.   The ceviche was fresh with perfect amount of acid.   The lomos (steak with tomatoes, onions, and French fries) was tender and paired well with the vegetables. Ask for their green sauce on the side, it's delicious on everything. They were nice enough to give me some to take home too!   The prices might look a little steep if you're going for a casual meal but the size and execution makes it worth it for me. We left happy and full."}
{"text":"This was much less than I expected as far as atmosphere, but exceed on flavor. It is a small mom and pop, with posters on the wall and hard wooden chairs. That said, the food was delicious!. Lacking in presentation, but full on flavor. I had the kabobs. Gave the beef heart to my friend and I had the chicken and beef tenderloin. Sooo tender, and full of a slow cooked flavor I can't fully describe. Out of this world. The side dishes need improvement, I got 1.5 boiled potatoes, and some hard white beans. But I will go back for that meat again. My friends all enjoyed their dinners as well."}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!   Was completely caught off guard by this unassuming little place!   Cozy business that shows off in a good way that this is a family run place.  Very clean and homey.  We felt very welcome and comfortable.    After taking drink orders we got to the business of deciding on dishes.   The wife chose Pescado Sudado which was a delicious poached white fish in a wine sauce.  It was a beautiful dish and very tasty.   I ordered the Peruvian fried chicken at the suggestion of our server.  I was originally grub to order the Cau Cau Pollo but he changed my mind.  And OH BOY I am glad that he did!   It was amazing and just fantastic.   It came with a pile of fries and a side salad.     The quantity, quality and pricing were all spot on.  The service was a bit slow but they had several tables and you should expect this from a family run establishment.   Our server was very friendly and asked if we had been to the restaurant before.  It was a very genuine question and he explained a few items to us.    Overall the entire meal was just great.   If you want Latin food with a twist from the norm, give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Peruvian surprise! Highly recommend, we had just finished the 2016 world's toughest mudder when we decided to go back and eat there again two days in a Role! Everything is Spectacular the waiter was awesome too, you won't be disappointed. We are from San Diego and eat out everywhere this was great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I want to try something new since I never have Latin foods before. I ordered the pollo Saltado to go. Fries on side. No soy sauce. Fine with me as long as no salt on it. all good. About $17 for the meal. Food came out of two big food containers. Not worth it. Small portion. Not enough for the price being paid. Chicken strips is dried. I wanted something with fries so I got this plate. I didn't even get my rice that was suppose to come with the meal! I'm just disappointed. First time and the last time for me."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate in Vegas when I arrived this summer and it just happened to be across the street from where I'm staying--Awesome. I've had Peruvian before, at a couple places in LA including Mario's. But this place was way more memorable:   Food: I ordered the 1/2 chicken while my roommates go varieties of pollo saltado and fried rice. The portions were huge! At least 1.5 servings of food per person, the only reason we were able to finish was because everything tasted so good. My chicken was cooked perfectly with the right amount of crisp and it was still juice, it even came with fries! My entire group thoroughly enjoyed their food. But the main kicker was the...  SAUCE! I can't take too much heat even though I'm Korean, but the two sauces they passed out were super addicting despite how spicy they were. If the waitress serves just one sauce, ASK FOR THE OTHER ONE! One of my roommates actually asked her if they sold bottles, it's that good.   Environment was your typical mom & pop shop, I'm assuming it's family owned. Food was awesome with great flavor, waitress was really patient with us and helped us navigate the menu, and I'll definitely be back for that sauce.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Peru and love the food - you WILL love this place too! The flavor of the meats are delicious. You will not be disappointed. For a real peruvian meal experience order either Inka Cola or Chicha Morada as your beverage. For appetizer, order the papa a la huancaina. If you like raw fish, get the ceviche de pescado too! They have a website with picture and the menu in case you want to explore more. If you are a meat and potatoes fan - you will love peruvian food. I enjoyed the pollo saltado and anticucho de pollo or lomo. You will want to go again and again!"}
{"text":"This place has solid Peruvian food! The menu explains exactly what is in each dish, and the staff is very helpful if you have any questions.  Most dishes come with fries and a sauce. I cannot, for the life of me, remember what the green sauce is called but it is delicious! I had a breaded chicken breast, seasoned with rosemary, thyme, and a plethora of other herbs, and it was delicious. The fries were crispy, not soggy, and they have a wide selection of drinks from South America.   If you are in the mood for something different, try this hidden gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"mi peru is one of the best peruvian restaurants i have ever been to. you can taste the authentic quality taste in their dishes. my friend and i enjoyed both of the dishes we got. mi peru offers a lunch special on MONDAY- THURSDAY from 11am- 3pm. 5-6 dishes are priced at $8.95. we got the papa a la huancaina and the arroz con pollo. the potatoes and egg is always delightful with the yellow sauce.   my favorite was the arroz con pollo dish with the rice and chicken. the dish came with a side of pickled onions that made the whole meal. the chicken was so moist and flavorful and the rice was really good. im only in vegas for a little time but i wouldn't mind to come back to try the other dishes. the server also gave us some fried corn kernels with the green sauce which was great!  the ambiance is quiet with low music and the furniture is very traditional. service was great and always made sure everything was going good. i would definitely recommend coming here for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Lomo saltado was excellent veggies simmered just right dish was delicious was worth the wait will be back"}
{"text":"Over the past 6 months my wife and I have tried just about every dish on the menu and we've liked them all! It's great having a restaurant like this in Henderson. We usually start with papas a la huancaina and go from there!"}
{"text":"This place is like a secret gem. The chicken dish Mi Peru Aji de Gallina is my favorite! It was so good! Truly some great comfort food. Also, the fish Cevice was amazing! I will always come here when I'm looking to get a hearty meal. The restaurant never has too many people inside, which means I always get great service. Plus Peruvian beer is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Bomb Food! Im crazy about the aguadito de pollo soup and the pescado ceviche. I eat here atleast once a week. Soooooooo GOOOD!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed by this place!  We strolled in on a Saturday evening and ordered the yuquitas fritas, arroz con mariscos, and a 1/2 order of the pollo a la brasa. The chicken was my main attraction that night (it's only available Thursday - Sunday, after 3pm).  It was pretty late, I think about an hour from closing and so there were only a few tables left and one waiter manning the floor. He was really nice, but busy. He still managed to greet us, offer us menus and a seat at a booth. He takes our order and offers us water while we wait. Super nice! He quotes us 15 minutes, comes out at around 20 to apologize and assure us it'll only be a few more minutes. It's totally ok as we did order quite a few different dishes, but the head's up is totally appreciated!  Our orders come as promised, and he takes the time to tell us what each box contained and which sauces are for what. I ask for aji sauce and he gladly gives me a couple of cups. This guy is outstanding. I wish I remembered his name, but my ass is horrible with names...I just hope every staff member here is as good as him.   The food was delicious! The yuquitas were still kind of crispy and it came with a mild, creamy Peruvian sauce. But the real star was the pollo and the aji sauce. The chicken was delicious, fall off the bone tender, and flavorful. Mmmm, paired with the spicy, thick aji sauce and *drooool* Next time I'm definitely going to order a whole chicken! We were stuffed though (the yuquitas are no joke) and saved the arroz con mariscos for lunch the next day. I really wish I ate it when it was freshly made, so I can't really comment on it. It was still good, but I know it would've been better fresh.   I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had to update my review as the owners took action on a few things.   They got a new chef!!!  This chef is getting the Aji sauce right.  The exact amount of seasoning and the overall food is much MUCH better.  Most Def 5 Star quality now.  Must haves: Llomo Saltado, Aji Sauce, Plantains, Seafood Mixto (Ceviche).  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely craving something different then your usual hamburger and pasta kind of day. Literally I could eat pasta everyday if prohibited.  As I searched Yelp for dinner ideas, I stumbled upon Peruvian.  I haven't had Peruvian in forever.  I miss those delicious cancha's (Peruvian corn nuts) those are seriously the most addicting things ever.  I must of ordered three extra servings. The server was nice enough to feed my addiction, my only complaint was there was none of the spicy green sauce or bread to accompany my hunger while we waited for our dishes. I was a little bummed that they didn't have the rotisserie chicken, I love eating.  I settled for the second best thing steak lomada (sorry if I misspelled that, I asked for the fries on the side for my picky eater.  My kiddo would probably have a melt down if his fries were smothered in that delicious sauce. I definitely was impressed with the dish, the meat was tender and soft, and the sauce had the perfect savory flavor I was craving.  I am not sure what my hubby ordered but it was delicious, the meat was tender and soft and bursting with flavor (no steak sauce needed) the egg was definitely a perfect touch. Overall this restaurant food was delicious and it wasn't too busy when we came. The service was a little slow, maybe because the food is prepared fresh and cooked on the spot.  So I will give them that, the server was nice and very helpful on any questions or suggestions.  Will I come back? Definitely! Would I recommend this place- yes!"}
{"text":"The food has been great every time! The ambiance is okay, and the large windows with hard flooring makes temperature control a little card ( hot in summer, and cold in winter)  but the food and service make up for it. I would recommend trying anything on the menu, so far I haven't found anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch. We were the first customers of the day. The waiter was very polite and attentive. The food was excellent. I highly recommend this place. I hope they can weather the economic storm, as it was very quite in the center the whole time we were eating. Only one other couple came in as we were leaving.  We had the lunch specials, which included a drink or the soup of the day."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation and was very happy! ! I got the arroz con mariscos and my bf got a breaded beef with pesto pasta. Both were delicious. The service was very friendly too w/o being overly friendly!!"}
{"text":"I took advantage of a leisure trip to Vegas and decided to try out this place on a nice sunday afternoon before going back to California. My party was of 4 people so our mad peruvian food feast started in a matter of minutes once we sat down lol  The dining room is decked out with nice Peruvian art work and paintings while the menu offers lots of fish, seafood, beef, chicken, pasta and vegetarian dishes, all made with Peruvian passion. Although they have some marvelous authentic appetizers, I decided to concentrate on the unique and adventurous entrees.  Our first two dishes were the Lomo Saltado, strips of lean top sirloin steak sautéed with tangy soy vinegar sauce with red onions, tomatoes, cilantro and French fries, and served with steamed white rice. This dish is all about flavors and textures and was very good and exquisite. The next dish is a meat lover's dream dish, the Parrillada Combo for up to 4 people. This platter consisted of wold-class and delicious Pollo a la brasa (rotisserie chicken), steak, 3 skewers of Anticuchos (beef hearts) along with fries and a salad. This parrillada combo was really exquisite and full of flavor, everything perfectly cooked and seasoned. To drink, we asked Cuzqueña beers which is the national beer for peruvians and it was just great! We ended our peruvian food feast with some Lucuma ice cream, really delicious! a must-have for ice cream lovers! :D The staff is friendly and the service is fast. Loved the fact that they had LCD screens showing some international soccer games.. This place rocks and I can't wait to come back and try more dishes.. 5 solid stars *****"}
{"text":"I really want this place to make it. It's an interesting restaurant in MY neighborhood. The first time I went in for takeout I realized how cute it was inside (it was hard to tell from outside since it is in a strip mall). It's very warm and charming inside. Everything we had was great. It was the rotisserie chicken and the beef saltado. In fact, I liked the saltado so much that I looked up how to make it on the Internet and have been making the chicken version about once a month. I went in for girls night out again last week. The girls, who had never been there before, loved it. We got the steak kabobs and they were a favorite. They have a pretty decent, although small, wine list. I recommend the Torrontes. Very inexpensive but delicious and refreshing with spicy savory dishes. The only problem I had was with the glassware. One of the girls' water glass was gross, and all of our wine glasses smelled like a sour dish rag. Gag! Other than that, I think this restaurant is a great addition to my little neighborhood, and I hope they stay busy and make it through this crappy economy. They should have a happy hour too BTW."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here twice. I had arroz con pollo both times and OMG, soooo good. Full of flavors, chicken falls of the bone. Gotta ask for the green sauce, they don't automatically give it to you. I had the flan too. Very good as well."}
