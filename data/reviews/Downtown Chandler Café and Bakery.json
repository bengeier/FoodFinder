{"text":"For the last three weeks, this has been my absolute go-to for lunch. I'm so glad I found this gem because it is delicious. I've been taking my co-workers as well and so far even the pickiest eater has been impressed. 

The bread is incredibly soft and perfectly toasted at the same time. I've had both the focaccia and the ciabatta and they are equally superb. You get a lot of meat and goodies on the sandwiches and they fill you up.

I've been cycling through the chicken salad sandwich, BLAT, and tuna salad. All have been excellent. The portions are large, the toppings are fresh and flavorful and nothing is dripping in sauce or condiments. Your sandwich is served with potato salad or pasta salad, I've tried both- it's a tie for the winner. The potato salad is more of a mustard base versus mayo- so keep that in mind if you don't like mustard. The sides are the perfect amount considering how filling the sandwich is. 

After staring at their counter of baked goods I broke down and bought a peanut butter cookie and chocolate chip cookie one day to take to my husband. Needless to say- only half the cookie made it home to him because they were so good. Crumbly and cooked just right. Very flavorful and not dried out at all. My co-worker swears by their black-and-white, cream filled cupcakes. The bakery items are impressive and something new is in rotation daily. 

I highly recommend this place for a quick lunch out and about- whenever I come to Chandler I'll be coming back to this restaurant. Everything I've gotten has been of consistent quality and taste."}
{"text":"This cafe is one of the most family friendly places I've been to. When you walk in; the baristas are very kind and help you if you need anything at all. I recommend the Benedicts because it's their signature plates and haven't found one that's this tasty for the speed of service and price! They have a wide varsity of pastries and the scones are to DIE FOR! If you see the coconut pineapple scone; get it before they're gone! I would recommend this cafe to friends; family; and travelers looking for a quaint cafe that has a menu as large as a market!"}
{"text":"Went here with high hopes given the name and location. We ordered a couple breakfast plates and a kids breakfast. The food looked good. That's where the positive experience ended. The food tasted bland, like it was cooked from frozen in a microwave. Eggs were off. The potatoes were underwhelming. Even the pancakes on the kids meal were disappointing. The coffee (which was scarce by 1030am) smelled and tasted gross. However, the biggest upset was the red velvet cupcake my daughter insisted I buy at the end of the meal. The cake part was dry and the icing was still frozen, the cupcake certainly wasn't made fresh that day. I get better flavored and better consistency cupcakes out of pre-made packages at the grocery store. When the business has \"bakery\" in the name and fails, you can be sure I won't be back. You had one job... one job!!!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but the food is top notch and the service is great."}
{"text":"This is our family's regular weekend stop.  Food is made with fresh ingredients and no lack of quantity.  Definitely recommend this little jewel in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip cookies EVER!!!! Friendly staff and always great food!"}
{"text":"Food is good and service is great.
What I always check for is consistency in places and this place hasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy but they need to be better about putting out orders in a timely manner. My friend got her food a whole 15 minutes before me, I also noticed a couple next to us that had the same issue. The employee did offer us a free pastry which was nice.. I would definitely go back hoping that it was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"My wife and I freakin love this place! Amazing service and amazing breakfast food! We shared the Waffle Platter our first time here and our second time my wife got the single waffle and I got biscuits and gravy with a sausage patty! Under $20 for both of us both times. Keep it up team!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast after the Tempe Breast Cancer Awareness walk.  Great waitstaff,  clean relaxing environment.   Unfortunately the food was not made to order and my omelette was made well before I arrived :(.. pre made food at its best.   How sad"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation of a family member. So glad we did!

The food is nothing short of spectacular! Generous portions, fresh ingredients, and very reasonable prices!  What's more can you ask for?

Wish there were places like this in California, will be back in November for more.  If we lived here we would eat here every day. 

The owner Hector came around making sure everything was well, how many owners take the time to do that? Not many I assure you. 

If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and try it, you won't regret it! 

Support your local small businesses!"}
{"text":"I love it. Great place for breakfast and lunch. Had the the John Wayne breakfast, so good! Everything I love for brunch. I have to recommend their cinnamon rolls and carrot cupcake. My go too place for coffee and cinnamon rolls in the morning. Sorry Starbucks I am won over buy a delightful cinnamon roll and coffee. As you can tell I am a fan, of their cinnamon rolls"}
{"text":"Eh; nothing special and the logistics of eating here tend to make it not worth it. 

Don't get me wrong, the food is good. But just that....good. To coordinate with the complete self service, long lines, lack of seating (both in door and out), it doesn't make it a good investment of time on a weekend. 

Three stars for food; minus two for lack of seating, parking, and waitstaff for a too small restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the honey mustard club and it was perfection. Cookies are delcious! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  Had the BLATT-a bacon, lettuce, avocado etc-sandwich with a side of fruit.  It was very good!

Everything on the menu looked delicious.  Nice staff, somewhat crowded but did manage to get a table.

Not-so-nice bathroom, a little on the dirty side but I was there towards the end of the lunchtime rush so...

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem.   Food and service was superior.  A definite come back cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast. Whether you want something light like yogurt and fruit, or something more substantial like a traditional breakfast or breakfast sandwich... Check em out. 

Carrot cake is great, and their kalifornia club is awesome."}
{"text":"My bf and I tried this place out because of the reviews and we wanted to try something new. We ordered two breakfast meals, a latte, and \"fruit smoothie\" (it was strawberry sugar, definitely not fresh fruit and was ready before done paying) the wait for the food wasn't long, when it came out it looked good. My Benedict was good but I requested a different bread that I didn't get and my fruit was old. My bf's chilaquiles was soggy, cold, and his eggs overdone. He didn't even eat them and got tacos from another place afterwards."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! First time there, this morning. I got the eggs Benedict and my buddy got the chilaquiles. We were both very happy with our meals and they definitely give you a good portion size for your money. I am definitely going back and spreading the good word about this little gem. Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great service,great food not too crowded so no long lines or long waits for food. Definantly try the Santa fe club sandwich and their potatoe salad is"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous cinnamon apple pancake breakfast here. Not too sweet with a generous topping of whipped cream with cinnamon sprinkles. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"This is probably the best café in town. If you are looking for a fun way to splurge with some friends or family, this is the place you're looking for."}
{"text":"First time here, for breakfast. Service was good. Coffee was terrible. Got the Kalifornia Benedict with extra protein--a hair in it. The waitress hesitated to replace the meal... really? The hollandaise must be from a mix, not fresh. Bacon was good as well as the potatoes. Eggs done great. Overall taste-meh. Three stars mostly because of the shedding and lack of decent espresso (please, don't add water to an espresso!)."}
{"text":"I was excited to try their cinnamon rolls after reading Yelppers' remarks about them. 

My wife ordered an omelette and I ordered a cinnamon roll and a side of bacon and coffee.  They asked me if I wanted the cinnamon roll heated up.  I said sure, and filled my to-go coffee cup. They handed me my cinnamon roll, and we sat down with our \"number\" for them to bring the rest of the order.

A while later, our order arrives.  My cinnamon roll of course is no longer warm.  The cold bacon they served was somehow welded together into a single over-cooked mass.  The cinnamon roll was interesting.  It seemed less like a cinnamon roll and more like a Mexican \"Novia\" pan dulce, with a thin custard-like semi-sweet frosting smeared generously over the top.  The outer edges were somewhat crispy, flaky and dry, and where the custard/frosting was, the pastry softer, having absorbed some of  the topping.  The entire pastry left an oily remnant behind on the plate.  While not unpleasant, they pastry I ate wasn't really what I expected when I ordered a cinnamon roll.  I wondered if the pastry was fresh - my impression was that it was day old.  The bacon was not good.  I probably should have sent it back.

My wife said her omelette was just okay.  The egg was thin, and she prefers a thicker, fluffy omelette.  She said the potatoes were good.  They were inch-sized cubes with seasoning.

The coffee was standard restaurant supply coffee.

I wanted to fall in love.  But the inattention to detail and the lack of ownership from the employees resulted in a mediocre-at-best experience.  The bacon should not have been served.  The cinnamon roll should have been served with the meal, instead of before.  Owner participation (or a real restaurant manager) could probably fix the problems here in a jiffy.  But I probably won't bother to make the drive from Ahwatukee to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Even though the eggs were over done on my Benedict I'm still leaving four stars because I think they're doing a great job. It's hard to have a smiling face in the morning and I appreciate the hospitality."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Easy on the pocket. It is a small place but big on flavors and quality. Really good breads and pastries.   :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Sunday morning, didn't have to wait long to order, and it didn't take long for us to get our food. I ordered a breakfast burrito with a side of toast and my friend ordered the tuna sandwich. Food was good , I wish they had substitutes for pork though. Workers were nice. Overall a pleasant experience , i would go back"}
{"text":"I had some time between my two morning business appointments and decided to search a breakfast place on Yelp, this place came up close by and here I was eating healthy special order omelette with nothing but fresh delicious ingredients and made from scratch, you won't be disappointed you made a stop here too, thanks to all friendly staff also thanks for keeping place very clean and neat,"}
{"text":"I had a delicious breakfast there this morning. I loved there coffee. I highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm from Montana, so I don't get to Arizona very often. My daughter and her husband and  granddaughter took me to breakfast and I had their wonderful waffles,\" yummy \"I'm a waffle girl and a pancake girl, so I had waffles eggs and sausage. I want to tell you this place was hopping, but that didn't stop the service from being fast. I want to thank everybody there for being kind and sweet, even when our little girl did go off a little bit, but you can take them outside and walk around and then bring them back in again.But I want to thank them for the wonderful food, the great service because everything was fantastic. Thanks again."}
{"text":"You will not leave here hungry.
The service is so friendly, food came out fast for a busy day (waited no more than 15 minutes, and it was busy), coffee is amazing (pumpkin spice latte which is much better than Starbucks!!), and everything was delicious. I got the Kalifornia Benedict, my man got the nova lox Benedict, we both got coffee (lattes) and milk...it came out to be 36$ (a little pricey for sure) but it was well worth the visit. Will be here again :)"}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday at 7:30am.  The staff was friendly and welcoming.  It's a cute place with some seating in the front and lots of seating in the back and patio.   We ordered and then took a seat.  Our food was out within 8-10 minutes.  

We ordered a cinnamon roll and the American breakfast plus coffee and tea.

The cinnamon roll was delicious, moist inside with a generous amount of frosting.  The American breakfast was very good even though we forgot to ask for the potatoes and toast to be well done.  My toast wasn't very toasted, but  the bread was so tasty that it was still good.  The bacon was excellent!  

We wish their coffee was better, but they did have a nice selection of teas."}
{"text":"I echo everything in Jessica H's review except while they do offer a new bakery item or two each day,  many bakery items sit there for days until sold. The product deteriorates and should only be sold the day it's made (or mark half off the next day). Also, the tea advertised as \"fresh brewed\" is also kept overnight if not all used and I promise you it tastes different!! Like, how much does it cost to make tea that you can't throw it out everyday?? These two things make me question how fresh everything in the back kitchen is and you will lose business over stale products. I really like this place so I'm hoping they stop selling old bakery items and tea."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a light lunch salad we could share, and we discovered the Tex Mex salad.  It was perfect for what we wanted.  They portion was just the right size for two to share, and the greens were fresh.  The southwestern dressing was excellent.  This is a great local restaurant for breakfast or lunch.  This restaurant is located in historic downtown Chandler surrounded by many excellent restaurants and shops.  A fun place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the cinnamon rolls are absolutely the best! My only complaint is that they sell out very fast and they need to have two cashiers, this place is probably making a killing, hire another cashier, please."}
{"text":"Nice building well dressed workers but cafeteria food line. I was disappointed , food was ok I won't go back ."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me to this place for breakfast today. We ordered the Florentine Benedict Eggs for $9.79. It was served on herby focaccia bread with turkey, spinach, tomato, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce! I got delicious and flavorful herb potatoes on the side.  The customer service was not too bad.  They was very busy the time we went however we didn't wait too long for the food. They place is really small, so we had to sit outside which was really warm and uncomfortable.  Overall the food was great! I wished we took a photo before,but we were super sweaty from the heat and were so hungry, we inhaled the food."}
{"text":"Breakfast meeting!
The food was better than average.  
Bagel with egg, cheddar and bacon!  Bacon a little well done with a burnt taste.  But other than that very good.
Breakfast with extra bacon, again same bacon (son wouldn't eat way too over cooked and tasted burnt and greasy).  Preference considered.
Shakes were nice and fresh.  Good little stop!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Great location. We love coming here on a slow Sunday morning to walk around the San Tan area after filling our bellies with delicious breakfast, lattes and pastries. Employees are kind and helpful."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday to get some quick breakfast. The cheese danish was incredible, and the mango smoothie was one of the best I've ever had. This place was great that we decided to go back the next day for breakfast. This time we had the eggs and chorizo, the ranchero omelette, and smoothies. The chorizo was a bit salty, but chorizo aside this place has really amazing breakfast choices. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"So we tried a smorgasbord of food. 
Love the fact the large menu also has large photos!!! Pictures  on the menu actually resemble the plate of food that is brought to the table
Husband love the breakfast croissant with the ham and cheese very impressed with the potatoes yes perfectly seasoned and soft.  
My pumpkin spice latte was amazing 
I love their zucchini cupcakes 
Side note their amazing moist bakery items are usually sold at other coffee places in Gilbert.

{"text":"One of the best eggs bennidict I've ever had, the hollandaise sauce is fantastic!! Great service, great menu!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The food was prepared and ordered exactly the way it was pictured in their menu board! Tasted delicious too."}
{"text":"It's nice quiet clean my lox is good, although I would like more lox. I could see myself eating here and chillin"}
{"text":"We love this place for sandwiches. It's a small place but has great food. Limited hours for lunch on the weekend. The sandwich is huge and the quality is great. We always order the same thing but everything we see served looks wonderful also. Try this place."}
{"text":"I had to find a place for lunch close to Chandler Gilbert Community College and found this place after searching on yelp.  Since it was National Sandwich Day (http://www.punchbowl.com/holidays/national-sandwich-day), I wanted a sandwich, gosh darn it!  I ordered the Whole Earth sandwich (veggie: lettuce, tomato, avocado, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, balsamic vinaigrette) which came with a side (I chose the potato salad).  I also got a free cookie for checking in on the yelp app.  My sandwich was good, if a *little* bland, my potato salad was yummy, and my cookie was disappointingly cakey and crumbly.  I still managed to eat it, though, as I abhor wasting food (especially baked goods).  Service was satisfactory and the place looked clean, two factors which contribute to an \"A-OK\" rating in my book."}
{"text":"I came to this place for the first time today for lunch. One of the employees recommended the Santa Fe Club so I decided to give it a shot. It was actually really good. I'll be coming back to try more of their food in hopes that it's as decent as the meal I ate today!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. Dirty plates left on tables. Had their \"Special\" Kalifornia sandwich which had everything in it but flavor. Customer service.....where was it? Idk. Had to practicly beg for my FREE cookie with check-in. NOT coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I work nearby and come here at least twice a week for coffee or lunch. Everything is so fresh. The restaurant is super clean and the staff and owners are super friendly"}
{"text":"The best kept secret for incredible sandwiches, salads and pastries in Downtown Chandler. Fresh baked bread too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First visit to Arizona and we were looking for great breakfast and coffee. Downtown Chandler did not disappoint!
Iced Dirty Chai latte - great
Latte Freeze (add caramel) - outstanding
Ranchero omelette - amazing 
John Wayne Breakfast - HUGE and delicious

But the star of the show - a side of pancakes. The syrup has a butter pecan taste to it that made the pancakes the highlight of our meal. 

Overall - don't come to Chandler without stopping here!"}
{"text":"Love getting my breakfast in the morning here and the service is excellent. We come every Sunday and  have tried almost everything on the menu and not one thing has been disappointing."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I've been around this area for years and never tried this place. Great dishes with a generous portions of avacados . Breakfast is all great. The medditerian omlette , ranchero, are what we had. Really good breakfast burritos. Tuna salad was the best I've ever had. Great prices ."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating on hard corrugated metal uncomfortable chairs. Table is cold black rough metal too. Interior sticky vinyl seats. Inside does nothing to shelter areas loud chatter. Not a relaxing place to enjoy food. Had the chongo bagel (works with cheese). missing any garlic and salt. Bagel was fresh tasting. Coffee just ok. For these high prices you would expect and deserve better. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"While wandering around downtown Chandler with my husband, we found this charming little place. It is very little on the inside but they do have tables on the outside where you can sit and enjoy your meal. This restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch but it is without a doubt a place I'll be coming back to many times in the near future. We are breakfast snobs and really do enjoy a good breakfast. My husband had the Mediterranean omelette and he says the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I have the banana and walnut pancakes which were so good I would go back for more if I wasn't stuffed. The portions are good and the wait staff are very nice and helpful. if you want to go to a relaxing breakfast or lunch and just enjoy Downtown Chandler this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great staff and excellent coffee!"}
{"text":"Food is worth every penny! The Apple & Cinnamon pancakes were fantastic. Great little cafe to visit in the downtown Chandler area."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning around 9. Thankfully it wasn't too busy, we were able to sit right away and the food came out quickly. We ordered the Santa Fe Club, the John Wayne Platter, a strawberry smoothie, and a cinnamon twist. It was all awesome and the employees were very kind. 

Definitely make sure to try something involving their baked goods. The bread on the sandwich and the cinnamon twist were so good. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute with delicious food! It is a tad small inside so seating can be tough. Make sure you get there early before the crowd hits:)"}
{"text":"This place has a great visual menu, but the food is average with an above average price. Way to much for the quality. Barely any meat on sandwiches. I would recommend going 2 doors south to Wimpys paradise!!! Great prices and even better food. They were closed when we tried this place:("}
{"text":"Goldmine in Downtown Chandler! You simply must try the cinnamon rolls if they have them. They run out quickly!! In a word:  DECADENT 
Very diverse menu. From the good old standard bacon and eggs to chorizo. The place is small but offers seating outside and window bar seating."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! Wanted some coffee after lunch at crust, so thought I would try this place out. Ended up with a chocolate croissant and dirty chai latte. Both were delicious! Croissant was soft and the chocolate was rich and creamy. Latte was perfect temperature and tasted like holidays in a cup! Cannot wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Great food and service in nice historic district area of Chandler.  You have to go here for great bakery items and more. I had the banana pecan french toast. It was by far some of the best french toast I have ever eaten.
After doing the Yelp check in I saw the free cookie coupon they offered. I picked a coconut oatmeal which was very yummy! 
They also have a $2 coupon for a full sandwich.  Try it! 
Oh and the coffee was good as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty bomb, I had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and their homemade potatoes. Nothing too out of the ordinary that was special about them, but they were tasty. My mother had the chorizo with eggs, she thought they was too acidic(maybe too much sauce) but I personally thought they were really good. Friendly service, will be back again."}
{"text":"Had the Kalifornia Benedict, fantastic! They also bake their own goods. The bagels rule."}
{"text":"Great food & even better staff! Found a new place to love. Can't say enough good about this place. Everything I've had has been great & will be returning soon.
Love to support the \"Mom & Pop\" place & this has my vote as one of the best in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"The food was great and it's really spacious! I had the Lox Benedict and I am impressed by the quality and size of the Lox! So Good! Go during a weekday morning for fast service."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with mom. A sandwich and a salad. Both were delicious and perfect for a quick lunch. Everything was fresh and delicious, and came out exactly as expected. Yum! If in Chandler it's a good choice."}
{"text":"Anyplace that serves breakfast potatoes and not hash browns can't get 5 stars from me but they came pretty close :) service is quick-- food is good. I was particularly impressed with their eggs Benedict, they make it with croissant instead of an English muffin."}
{"text":"Food is above average. Compared to brunchies it's 10x better. Therefore, best choice for downtown Chandler breakfast. They were out of a lot of bakery items, that was disappointing. They were also out of fruit. I would not recommend purchasing coffee here. They did attempt to fix our coffee order and were very nice about it. Don't feel they have a good enough coffee product. Will not be back for breakfast, but will not be back for coffee."}
{"text":"Their cookies are GREAT! I now bring these to events and they are always a hit, and huge. Their sandwiches are also good. I need to try more on the menu, happy they are in DTC."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast area, would recommend this place all friends and family ! If your looking for a good coffee and breakfast In my opinion beats your regular ihop or Denny's . The food and service is on point , kitchen knows what they are doing and cashiers are so kind and sweet . Big spot to enjoy with family and they just added a whole back seating area , where I personally like to sit , good vibes and good music"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here on a Saturday right after they opened.  We weren't expecting a walk-up and order type place, which was our only disappointment, and the only reason we didn't rate this five stars:  The ordering process took longer than I thought appropriate. 

I had the John Wayne and my wife had the Breakfast Croissant.  Both were cooked perfectly, although I was surprised that the potatoes (a ton!) covered the eggs and ham on the John Wayne plate.

We sat outside, as the weather was perfect for outdoor seating.  Unfortunately, another restaurant (not open yet) had rap music blaring loud enough to disrupt talking.  So next time we'll sit inside.

We'll visit again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Fresh ingredients, fast and courteous service. Had the lox and works. Very good portion and loved the chongo bagel. My wife had the oriental salad and loved it. Comfortable atmosphere and nice little patio."}

{"text":"Food is great and affordable too! Bakery items are a good take home option as well. Friendly service and place is nice and clean"}

{"text":"Was visiting Chandler. Our hotel was nearby so I yelped a good breakfast spot. This place had good reviews. Went two days for breakfast during my vacation. Was really happy! There's lots too choose from selection wise on the menu. I ordered the lox was delicious. Kids menu is big portion too, so I was able to share with my baby girl. I'll definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Great little local place.  Seating is limited.  Find a way to try the baked goods.  The cinnamon twist will leave you planning your next fix, err... visit."}
{"text":"I stood under the \"order here\" sign for 10 minutes with three women behaving nd the counter looking at me like I had two heads. Nobody bothered to ask to take my order. What gives?"}
{"text":"Came by for the first time for breakfast and will be definitely back. Food was very good. Service was excellent. Place is much bigger than it looks with a huge room in the back and a very nice patio in the front and back. Food portions are very large. My son loved his breakfast burrito and cookies and cream frape. The lox Benedict was very tasty and an interesting breakfast combination.  I kept seeing all kinds of wonderful dishes getting walked by our table. Gotta try his place out!"}
{"text":"We dropped by for a weekend breakfast, and it was absolutely packed. One of the employees went out of her way to find an extra chair for us, without us even asking. Both of our breakfasts were delicious as well, the breakfast burrito came with a flavorful salsa and the French toast was perfection."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, and we loved it!

Hubby and I have strolled past this little spot many times when visiting downtown Chandler, but we're usually in town for dinner so the restaurant was always closed.  Today we decided to seek out a new place for breakfast and settled on Downtown Chandler Cafe and Bakery.  So glad we did!

I ordered the Mediterranean Omelette with artichoke hearts, red peppers, onions, tomatoes and cheese.  It was absolutely delicious - cooked just right.  The portion was ample and served with a small side of fresh fruit and cottage cheese, a perfect complement.

Hubby ordered the bacon and cheese omelette and loved his dish as well.  When it was delivered he said \"I'll never b able to eat all this!\"   Famous last words.  He ate every bite - plus the homefries.  

The coffee was hot and very good.  It is serve yourself, so it is easy to quickly get refills. 

Service is friendly, fast and welcoming.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.

I highly recommend Downtown Chandler Cafe and Bakery for breakfast.  Now we are planning to try it for lunch."}
{"text":"Really cool coffee place right on the main drag in Chandler.  I dropped in mid week for a cup of coffee and to get a little work done.  The staff was great and once I took a look at the menu I knew I would be grabbing a bite as well.  I had the California Benedict and it was outstanding.  Combine that with the strong wifi and plentiful seating and you have a great place do get a little work done or meet with friends.  If I lived a little closer I would be here once a week."}
{"text":"There chicken salad sandwich was amazing!!! I love this place!!!! The girls at the front were happy and the establishment was very clean and cute!!! Will be eating here weekly for sure!!!!!!! YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the only slight criticism I have with this place is that it is a little on the pricyish side. I would say more like $$$ instead of the $$ listed in the description. 

BUT...you truly do get what you pay for here. Every bakery item, all the bread they serve and the sides of pasta and potato salads you get with your sandwich made....in...house/fresh every day! (and it shows...omg) Not to mention the ingredients in everything are fresher than the prince of bel air! 

I can't wait to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Kalifornia Bendict is so good. Rich, creamy and a little kick of spice. 8 year old daughter said biscuits and gravy was the best she's ever had. They made a turkey sandwich for my 10 year old that wasn't even in the menu. Hubby had Sante Fe Club and really liked it a lot. Great service."}
{"text":"I work next door and I eat here every day! :) 

My favorites are: BBQ Chicken, Santa Fe Chicken and Tuna melt sandwiches. all come with your choice of pasta salad, potato salad or fruit salad. 

Everything is fresh and prepared on the spot, the staff is super friendly and the pastries are so good!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy and fresh food for breakfast and lunch! Friendly and quick service and big portion sizes. Also the free cookie you get when you check in is also very delicious :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast Made By Barbara The Kalifornia Benedict & Chorizo & Eggs. So Fresh & Delicious. You Can Tell The Focaccia Is Made In House."}
{"text":"I have stopped in before in the last 2 years but the line has always been long.   Yesterday I was just walking by nd bought coffee and an Apple Danish.   Coffee was great and the Danish,  well what can I say.   I also noticed a dish on their menu that brought back memories.. Chilaqulles with red sauce.  That's what I ordered today.  I still can't see my keyboard clearly.   I remember my mom in each bite."}
{"text":"Bagels baked fresh! Melt in your mouth. My daughter and I have gone a couple of times.  Not sure why a  pepper and a pickle were on the side of a lox bagel but one time they were fresh and juicy and the second time was withered and dry like the lox that was served."}
{"text":"First visit here. Trying the berry square and the cinnamon roll. The \"dirty chai latte\" sounds intriguing.

Obviously quite a bustling and popular place in downtown Chandler, I find this place doesn't have that hipster vibe, which I'm glad it isn't. Coffee is good, pastries are delicious, and that's all a cafe is supposed  to be about. 

Next time I'll check out the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and happened upon this cafe!   It was excellent....chicken salad sandwich on focaccia was delicious, not to mention the pastries!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great can get busy but such a nice place to eat breakfast and has such a nice view of downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"Loved the serbice, atmosphere and my Southwestern breakfast was amazing. Love sitting next to folks speaking Spanish all around me."}
{"text":"This has become our go to spot on Saturdays for breakfast, my daughter loves their waffles and we enjoy our dishes, have tried several of them, can't wait to try all of them! They also have pastries that look delicious, they seem to have a wider selection on the weekends m, haven't tried them yet but will definitely try them next time!"}
{"text":"Glad we stopped in here. Clean and well decorated and the Reuben sandwich was very good. Will be back"}
{"text":"Cute place right in down town Chandler. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. We had a breakfast burrito and sausage and gravy. Will want to try other things there because did not find either of the dishes noteworthy. What I will say is the service is impeccable. All the people very nice and not a table stays dirty. The second you get up they are cleaning it off for the next person!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was flipping delicious! Visiting in town we were brought to this place to have for a quick breakfast.  They have a large breakfast menu on their board above the cashier. They also have a lunch option as well.

With check in you receive a free chocolate chip cookie and now that I think about it I'm not sure what happened to it. Someone must have snagged it from me! Ha. I ordered the breakfast French toast which came with eggs and choice of bacon, sausage, or ham. I got the ham. The French toast was amazing! Perfectly cooked. It was light and and easy to bite into. It wasn't soggy and had great flavor. I didn't want to share! The eggs were good, a little cold but that's probably because I almost forgot about them eating my delicious French toast. The ham was okay. My daughter got the fruit waffle which was also very tastey. It came with whipped cream and fruit on top. My hubby got a burrito which had lots of flavor and wasn't skimpy. 

Next time I'm back in the area I will definitely make sure I make it to breakfast here!"}
{"text":"The counter girl is horrible!!! The last 2x I went in for pastries the ditzy girl behind the counter was talking to boys, distracted, not listening to questions I asked her and plan incompetent. Not sure if I'll go back even though the pastries are great because of her. Ugh :("}
{"text":"This place is great! Convenient for a weekend breakfast, free parking, large portions, great baked goods, and reasonable prices! They even have yelp deals!!"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp so gave it a shot this morning.  Instead of breakfast they had a Fresh turkey sandwich on a croissant with cranberry sausage.  My wife and I split it.  They served us each half with our own fruit side.  Very nice.  Great place to split!
The sandwich was amazing.  All fresh ingredients and tasted terrific.  We are going back next time for breakfast.  What we saw coming out of that kitchen looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the overall low quality of the food we received. 
Waffles with berries ended up being a soggy undercooked waffle with frozen berries on too. The complimentary water smells/tastes like it came straight out of the bathroom sink. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We went for a late brunch today.  Food was fine and employees were all very nice.  We didn't try the pastries - but they looked AWESOME!!!  They have a cute back patio for non-summer months.  Gave 3 stars instead of 4 because it just seems a bit pricey for an essentially self serve style cafe. . . . . ."}
{"text":"LOVE AT FIRST BITE. This is my go-to breakfast spot. 

I recommend the Kalifornia Benedict. This place is delicious,  their baked goods are amazing as  the cinnamon rolls,  Danishes,  and cheesecake get an A+. 

They are also very honest,  my Fiance left her purse on the patio and they put a note out on the door when they closed saying they found it and when I came to pick it up they handed it over,  but on after I proved my identity.  

Honest owners,  considerate staff ,  great food.  Best Benedict I have had in town and it's only $9 (Please never change!)"}
{"text":"Wow! I really wanted to like this place, but I was so very disappointed! My husband and I came here for breakfast and we both said we won't be coming back. 

When we first walked in they was no greeting. We should have known we were in trouble when we saw the sign that said they were out of pancakes today! And it was 9 o'clock in the morning! WTH? So we ordered our food and I had ordered coffee. She forgot to add the coffee in. We finally made it to our seats I got my coffee and then I took a look at the hot sauce bottles and they all looked disgusting. It was as though the hot sauce bottles were old and dirty. When our food came my French toast was cold my husband's waffle was cold and the butter didn't even melt either one. Our food was just OK nothing to write home about at all. We will not be coming back I can't tell you how disappointed I was because I was really looking forward to a cute nice breakfast with my hubby. Oh yeah, the service was not that good either. After I sent my French toast back they never came back to check to see if I liked the new French toast. Just bad all around. The food did look very pretty as you can see by my photos but maybe we ordered the wrong thing but we did not like it. I had eggs Benedict and French toast my husband had Florentine Benedict and a waffle. My husband said there was one saving grace,  \"At  least the fruit was cold!\""}
{"text":"In short, this place is EXCELLENT. I am VERY selective when it comes to breakfast so if you're deciding between two places hope this helps. 

We ordered a breakfast burrito and the French toast with mixed berries ~ both were delicious. 

At $4.99 the breakfast burrito is a steal but more important than the value, was the taste. The eggs were fluffy, potatoes cooked perfectly, bacon crisp (as requested) and cheese perfectly portioned. (One of my biggest pet peeves is the overuse of cheese to mask the shortcomings of other ingredients.) Beyond the quality, I also really appreciated the craftsmanship of the burrito. All the ingredients were assembled to perfection and beautifully balanced (see pic) vs. overwhelmingly big and hard to eat (ie: falling apart). If I lived around here this would be my go-to order. 

The French toast was also solid. Nicely sized bread/ thickness and favorable texture (no soggy edges here). Most notable however were the mixed berries I requested as the topping. They were impressive - envision a farm fresh, high integrity compote. I honestly wasn't expecting that level of quality from the fruit but it was a welcomed surprise. 

Beyond the food, the service was great. Friendly and helpful. I really appreciate it when the staff proactively inquires if you'd like your plates split. They portioned our French toast for us to avoid the hassle of taking turns on bites (my mom and I were sharing both of the orders). 

Atmosphere is cute-ISH. Nothing to write home about but absolutely fine for what it is. In truth, if you consider the cost/QUALITY of our meal (roughly $15) the atmosphere is very nice. We didn't sit outside but I like that they have the option. 

My only \"meh\" comment is regarding the croissant I got to go. It wasn't a top pick. In fairness I waited a few hours post bfst to eat it (that probably contributed). Didn't rank highly so if you're thinking about pastries or a real bfst - I'd encourage going the protein route. Get the burrito!

All in all, this will be a DEFINITE must hit every time I'm in town. 

Tip* Be sure to check if they have a free coupon via YELP - I scored a free coffee when we went. 

Eat up and ENJOY! This place is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Stopped by Downtown Chandler Cafe the morning after attending a great kd lang concert at Chandler Center for the Arts. The front end is order at counter and they bring the gourmet tasting food to you.  Front has a small eating areas, but there is seating outdoors and a large \"Gathering Space\" in the back.  Wife had Kalifornia Benedict and I had Peach Cobbler Pancakes.  Added two cups of coffee to top off breakfast.  The Peach Cobbler Pancakes were outstanding; fluffy cakes topped with Peaches, whipped cream and just the right amount of spices.  The Benedict arrived with an ample amount of chunked potatoes and bacon, and two poached eggs on focaccia toast.  Benedict was good, but the eggs were poached a little too passed poached into over cooked.  Wife didn't care for hard yoke, but I ate them for her.  Serving sized are large enough to share.  Next we order one entree and split."}
{"text":"My family and I love it here! They have great breakfast as well as pastries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in the valley. I worked in downtown Chandler for over a year and I can't tell you how often I've gone here. It has that small down charm but has that big city flavor. I love the staff there. Super kind and professional. The cinnamon roll is what got me in the door but their savory breakfast items like the Benedict and the burrito are what keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy but oh so worth it!!! The cinnamon rolls are huge with a perfect sweet to salt ratio. The girls here are great and always willing to recommend a dish for you if you're undecided. Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! HUGE menu, and delicious food! Fun environment too! I'm sitting on patio, and there is a CAR SHOW in front of us!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent the food was good I had 1/2 a ham & cheese sandwich with a salad can't say much about the salad.
Should have had their pizza, had it before and tasted like Chicago Southside thin crust pizza, excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and no complaints here. Breakfast burrito was delicious,  as well as the coffee.  I had a pastry and was definitely pleased.  Good service too."}
{"text":"We came in trying new places and wow this place was great!!  The sandwiches were amazing and I wanted breakfast so they made me a custom breakfast with out question and it tasted amazing!!! I would definitely come back with my wife and kids.  Next time I will try their bakery stuff. Looked amazing but I'm way too far right now to try and eat sweets!"}
{"text":"No, really, it gets 5 stars. 
1) warm, inviting, unpretentious cafe ambience
2) Layers of flavor in the food. Gastro delight.
3) Friendly staff (and not in that \"I'm paid to talk to you, but I hate myself for this\" way that some places offer).
4) Location. In a revamped/restyled area that has done it right with a place like this
5) And , this one is important! They can make a cappuccino. (So many cafes pop up with no clue on how to brew.)

Yesterday I had an orange poppy seed muffin with a cappuccino. Poppy seed is by far my fave muffin and I always find lemon, which is great, but this orange added a rich sweet/tangy twist. Baked on site. You can't beat that.

Today I had the Kalifornia Benedict. The presentation was beautiful. It was stacked perfectly and layered nicely. I forgot to say \"no bacon\" so I had to pull it off myself which led to an under salted dish; but that was my fault! If you eat bacon, you'll love this dish.

I could go on, but let's stop here until I visit again. I mean, I have to come back for the chilaquiles afterall..."}
{"text":"This place is very solid. I have been ordering here for two years ,Its definitely  one of those places where you can eat everything on the menu and be confident that it will be good. They are very consistent, portions are great. The girls taking the orders are wonderful in being precise and always nice . I've NEVER had a call- in mess up. It is clean, and the ingredients are fresh. When I have ordered salads that have avocados I'm always very impressed how much of the real avocado they give you ,not this guacamole moosh everyone sells as avacados.  The breakfast burritos are amazing, salads all great. I love the tuna salad. Mediterranean omlette is just fabulous! This place had a good sugar free vanilla latte they make that is really good and creamy, AND above all fair pricing."}
{"text":"Brunch was very good! We had the waffle breakfast and the John Wayne Platter...everything hit the spot! Place was very clean and seating was just right for the semi small area but outside seating was a plus! We got a cheese cake with berries on the way out and it was great! We'll return soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch as a first-timer. I enjoyed the Tuna Salad. Delish! 
The breakfast menu looks amazing. The service is fast and friendly. Patio seating will be nice for the cooler months. Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Very good food, yummy fresh, and looks better in real than the pictures. Try it , you won't be disappointed, I love their breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to grab breakfast or lunch. So far I have tried their French toast, and a salad/sandwich combo both of which were delicious! They also have a great hazelnut latte! I have yet to try their baked goods, but always a good selection which changes daily."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and baked goods are always a treat! Unfortunately I'm a vegetarian and the majority of the times I've order a meal without meat they put it on anyways. It's made me very sick in the past and I've called to let them know (as to not repeat the problem) however it continues to happen."}
{"text":"I was given a gift certificate for this place last Christmas and finally talked my wife into trying it out (she does not like to try new things). So I disguised it as her birthday breakfast yesterday. Let me say, staff- very friendly. Place was clean, there is an option to eat inside or at the tables out front. She had the American Breakfast, which she really liked. I had the Kalifornia Benedict and a pumpkin spice latte. I would agree with another reviewer, that pumpkin spice latte would certainly give Starbucks a run for their money, it was very good and balanced. Same with my breakfast, the hollandaise sauce was not overwhelming, it complimented the breakfast and I was really able to enjoy the variety of flavored that this breakfast offered. Needless to say, the wife is convinced and really liked it, and after that great breakfast I enjoyed, we will definitely be returning. The prices we felt were comparable to going to any chain for breakfast, but the food quality and flavored were far superior at Downtown Chandler Cafe and Bakery."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! Always fresh and so yummy! one of my favorite spots to grab breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Great menu selection and reasonable! My wife got the sausage breakfast burrito. It wasn't oversized, but it was perfect for $4.99. I got the Kalifornia Club and it was delicious. I used the yelp check in coupon for a free chocolate chip cookie and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Second time to this gem and we just finished Father's Day breakfast and HAD to compliment the entire breakfast. Food, service, ambience was 100%. Breakfast burrito was delicious, Belgian waffle and French toast. The dirty chai is also a MUST HAVE. Love this fresh bakery!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods.  

Their signature pastry is then huge Cinnamon Roll smothered with whipped cream butter.  

Come and enjoy their other deliciousness with sweet treats.  

Also a great place for breakfast.  

Come early for a table bc it gets crowded after 10am on the weekends. 

Limited seats"}
{"text":"Very generous portions. I almost changed my lunch order to breakfast when I smelled a breakfast plate come by. My party all ordered different things and everyone was pleased."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in downtown Chandler. Everything is reasonable priced and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great location for breakfast, brunch and lunch! We got the Sante Fe and Chicken salad sandwich. Way too much food. Definitely large sandwiches. The food was so delicious and extremely fresh. The flavors with sauces make the sandwiches. Very happy with our overall experience from the service to the food 10/10. Will recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"1st time visitor here. Excellent place. Will be back for sure. Super friendly employees. Delicious food."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous find.  You order at the front and then your food is brought to you.
Other than that you are left  alone. Had a perfect  sausage and cheese omlette. My guests had the John Wayne and the peach cobbler pancakes. All of us were very satisfied. Good flavor to all the dishes. The atmosphere was laid back. It was easy to find extras like sweeteners, take away boxes,napkins, etc. This is a restaurant I will go to again in the near future to try  lunch."}
{"text":"We ended up here after visiting City Hall.  The breakfast burrito was very big, filling, and tasty.  I ordered a Latte and it was excellent.  My mom ordered regular coffee and she felt it was too bitter for her taste.  The cinnamon roll was tasty.  Great little place to stop in at.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love love love. I had the breakfast burrito with eggs, sausage, cheese, potato. Yum yum yum. Very impressed. Clean. Cute. Reasonable prices. Fresh. Always love when the kitchen is open to see. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place and love their breakfast.   Great food with lots of choices that have fresh quality food.  I love their Benedicts!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip for breakfast and it was so good!  I've taken a few people here and everyone raves about their meal.  The  Florentine Benedict is wonderful with a perfectly made hollandaise sauce.  The French toast with bananas and pecans is a crazy good breakfast treat .   They serve coffee, smoothies , baked goods, breakfast and lunch .  Everything  looks fabulous and everything I've tried has been incredible.  When you first walk in it's a bit overwhelming and seems very crowded but don't worry there is additional seating in the back and so many perfected items to choose from."}
{"text":"What can i say about this place? They're awesome! I had their Italian chef salad, which was very good and of ample portions. For dessert I tried a chocolate chip cookie. It tasted homemade! They are all very friendly. It's no wonder why they were busy and had many return customers (i heard a girl worker tell an older couple \"good to see you, you don't usually come here on Sundays!\") They know their customers:)
I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is tasty. I have never had a bad breakfast there. A couple of my favorites are the California Benedict and French toast. Always pretty quick as well. If it's busy, it's hard to find a seat but when it's nice out there's a few tables outside. Highly recommend this for a delicious, quick breakfast."}
{"text":"No matter what you order you can't go wrong everything is simply delicioussss!!! My personal favorite is Santa Fe Club. Oh & make sure you leave room for dessert the cinnamon rolls are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Reviews looked great. I ordered the Kalifornian Benedict. It was delicious! Service was good. My kids had the pancakes and waffles with fruit. So good. Loved the decor. You order and seat yourself style. They deliver the food to your table. Indoor and outdoor seating. We got here at 10:00am and there was no wait. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their club sandwich is awesome and the pesto pasta salad is the best I've ever had. One suggestion would be to upgrade the pickles. Everything I ordered today was top notch, except the darn soggy pickle, lol. Maybe try Mt.Olive dill spears, they stay crisp and delicious!!"}
{"text":"The raspberry italian soda is so good. We also had the dirty chai, a smoothie, a chocolate chip cookie which was huge and a chocolate cupcake. Fast service and the yummiest treats. I only wish we could visit more often. Located in a nice little area to walk around downtown Chandler too to walk off a bit of the sugar."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a great place to eat breakfast. We have been everywhere and not very successful until today!  Amazing food, great prices, and friendly staff. Finally we have found a place we love!  Try it, it's a must!"}
{"text":"This is little spot is a bit of a haul for us, about 45 minutes, but it is good enough that we will come back for breakfast/brunch/lunch. We have tried the chorizo and eggs (a decent sized portion but not overwhelmingly so), peach pancakes (three very tender pancakes covered in cinnamon peaches), the Italian Chef Salad (a lot of Italian meats and provolone on field greens), plus their cinnamon roll. Everything is made fresh to order, so it may take a bit longer to get your order, but it is also homemade. Well, okay, not the cinnamon roll, but all of the baked goods are made fresh daily. The cinnamon roll was big enough to share and they will heat it for you if you want. Frankly, that's usually a mixed blessing because heating enhances the flavor but it's usually in a microwave which toughens the bread. We opt out. Not sure if they warm in an oven or microwave in all fairness. It's definitely fit for a wide range of ages and everyone should find something to like on the menu."}
{"text":"I used to consider myself a donut person, not a danish person. Not anymore. Thank you, Hector!"}
{"text":"Excellent little non-chain coffee, breakfast and lunch place. It is fast and friendly. Right in the heart of Downtown Chandler, about 100 yards from the San Marcos Hotel"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time. The food was excellent and there was definitely enough of it. I only had a bagel with cream cheese. My BFF had the breakfast croissant, my hubby had an omelette and our other friend had the breakfast sandwich. And all of them cleaned their plates. Coffee was good and they remembered my husbands milk. Seating is tight so get there early. Bagel choice was limited but we were a little later at 0900. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and drinks. We timed it right and beat the crowd, which became standing roon only. The portions are very generous and everything is made in house. Brought home cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and since it had wonderful reviews we decided to try it.
The menu is extensive with many choices available for breakfast and lunch. I had the tuna sandwich with  the pasta salad and my husband had the Reuben and potato salad, both were so good and also the pasta and potato salad .
The service is prompt and everyone is very polite and friendly. Definitely will come back to also try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've written 22 Yelp reviews total, which are all 5 stars and this is my first 1 star review. We came in around 11AM on 5/28/17. The Strawberry-Banana Smoothie had neither of those main ingredients, which you would expect seeming it is a made to order Strawberry-Banana Smoothie. I ordered the Chilaquiles, which seriously there is no way the person who prepared this and put it in the window and said that looks like something edible. It was definitely straight out of the microwave. When the person dropped off the food to the table next to ours she looked at my plate, then looked at me and kept walking. She could tell it was gross but didn't want to say anything? I wanted to go back in and take the $5 tip out of the jar I left when I ordered. If your reading this go to Wimpy's, Original Chop Shop, or San Tan which are all on the same block and get a much better product for your money."}
{"text":"This place is a great breakfast spot. My co workers and I love breakfast for lunch and sweet or savory, we always get what we want. Make sure if you order was and want them scrambled you tell them so. Each checking is a free cookie too. Their iced tea is delicious. And if you don't eat meat you can substitute meat for and avocado."}
{"text":"This place was average for the food we got. The cinnamon roll texture was more croissant than your typical yeast risen dough and the cream cheese glaze was extremely rich. I had a ham breakfast burrito and it was okay, not good but not bad; just average. My friend had the lox and it was good. It's a nice small place and the service is good."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!!  sooooo delicious. Definitely a new fav!!!!  Went there for brunch.  Great staff, clean place.  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Located in popular downtown Chandler, it is a very busy and casual cafe that has very good food.  Portions are huge and ambience is very entertaining.  Order food at the counter, get a number, wait staff brings it to you."}
{"text":"My husband & I love to go out for breakfast, so we searched for a new spot and we found a great one in Downtown Chandler Café and Bakery. The food was GREAT!! All the baked goods are made in house a Plus. We had apple pancakes & lox & a bagel. So many great choices . Another plus was the staff .Hi,to Alundra,Gigi & Anna,and the cooks and baker. We WILL be back"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here, I've never been for lunch. The servers are always so friendly and helpful. Sometimes it gets a little packed inside but that just tells you how good it is."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple days ago I had the Mediterranean omelet and my daughter had the Kalifornia Benedict both were fresh well prepared and delicious portions are just right. We also had a freshly baked cookie all of the baked goods look great we will definitely come back here and look forward to trying some more dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. The cinnamon rolls were amazing. Quality food and the prices are not bad. Great service, good music, and overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meet here with family after a wedding. Great breakfast, coffee choices and parties! Will visit again"}
{"text":"We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the breakfast croissant. The biscuits and gravy were decent but nothing that blew my mind. Could've definitely used more gravy on such a large biscuit also. My husband said the bacon on his breakfast sandwich was not crispy and he didn't like his breakfast potatoes because he said he could taste the oil they were cooked in. Also have the chocolate chip cookie and it was average. This was our first time we will give it another try and report back maybe we'll try lunch next time!"}
{"text":"My huband and I love this place I always get the kalifornia Benedict it is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love the mellow cafe atmosphere, ordered a iced dirty chai- absolutely delightful! Upon checking in you can choose from a variety of massive cookies, I opted for chocolate chip which was fresh and chewy! There is a plethora of options to choose from on the menu, plenty of breakfast and lunch options!  Great place"}
{"text":"Very good little place with a good breakfast menu and great morning drinks. THE best Chai Latte.....ever! Hubby enjoyed the coffee and we both gobbled up our breakfasts. Worth a stop while you're in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped by for breakfast and were very happy with the decision. The baked goods in the cabinet looked amazing. We had the waffle platter and kalifornia eggs Benedict. The waffle platter was a good, standard dish. Tried and true. The Kalifornia Eggs Benedict was made with jalapeños and on a focaccia type bread. We weren't a fan of the bread but the jalapeños were an interesting addition. Also, we ate outside and it was a pleasant environment and we could hear the music from the brewery next door (but it wasn't too loud)."}
{"text":"Great place and great service. Breakfast was great and we loved watching the Indy 500 and making new friends who also like the race."}
