{"text":"Visited this newly established restaurant last Thursday and I must say it's a hidden gem. The place is very unsuspecting from the exterior as it is located in a strip plaza. The menu is quite extensive and offers a fusion of Canadian and South Asian foods. 

We tried the following dishes:
1) Butter chicken kothu 
2) Spicy chicken kothu 
3) Deviled chicken 

Each dish was flavorful and served in generous portions. All dishes tasted fresh and full of body and flavour. All in all 5 stars for this establishment and I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Went back to try the Butter Chicken Kothu Roti and Butter Chicken Poutine. Spicy + Gravy. 

Really rich butter sauce, healthy amount to coat everything. A tad heavy but well worth it. Requesting gravy is a must. 5/5."}
{"text":"We ordered a butter chicken kothu rotti. It tasted and looked like plain chicken kothu. No gravy, no butter chicken flavor. If we wanted chicken kothu we wouldve asked for it or went elsewhere. Very disappointed. Will not be coming back."}
