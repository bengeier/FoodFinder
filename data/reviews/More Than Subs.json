{"text":"DISGUSTING. DID NOT EAT OUR MEAL. We ordered take out here through SkipTheDishes without hesitation because of its high ratings (google: 3.5/5, SkipTheDishes: 9/10, yelp: 5/5). As soon as we opened up the first package we knew something was off.  The spring rolls were COVERED in grease. Yes I understand spring rolls are deep fried and there will be some residue but our hands were DRIPPING with grease and the spring rolls were wet. We tried to look past the grease and took a bite. Inside the spring rolls were rice noodles and one carrot. $6 for 3 spring rolls, that's a giant ripoff. The spring rolls didn't even come with the standard fish sauce, instead it came with (clearly store bought) sweet chilli sauce.   So disappointing, but honestly if everything else was at this level we still would have suffered through, but after opening the next packages I couldn't even take a bite.  My boyfriend ordered the lemon grass chicken vermicelli (C4 on the menu) and it looked like any other chicken vermicelli. After two bites he had to stop and spit it out it was so gross.   Now the pho was the most disgusting and disappointing item we received.   I ordered the beef sate noodle soup (C8 on the menu). When I opened the first package everything looked normal, rice noodles felt fresh, all of the sides were there. Then I noticed the beef was missing. If they had forgotten the meat, I wouldn't have cared, I was very hungry. Some restaurants put the meat in the broth so I opened that package to take a look. After stirring the broth and picking out a piece of meat it looked a little off to me so I took it out of the bowl and took a harder look. IT WAS GROCERY STORE ROAST BEEF. Very gross. When I order a dish that is described as \"tender sate beef\" I don't expect sandwich meat roast beef. It also included other meat as well which surprised me because the menu didn't say anything about beef balls or more than one type of beef. This time the meat (cannot even confirm that it is beef) was in a sort of sausage form and VERY rubbery/slippery. I lost my appetite right then and there.   I was not in the mood to play mystery meat roulette and even try the broth. Probably would have gotten food poisoning if I went through with it.   If I could give this place 0/5 I would. I love Vietnamese food and have tried many places in the city and have never been so disappointed.   Overall we wasted $35 and will never return. I hope the restaurant gets in touch with us and tries to make things right because I will never recommend this to anyone."}

{"text":"If your hungry and you want good food at a decent price try this place. I've been here a couple of times and I noticed the couple that run the place are trying the best in what they serve. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome takeout! We ordered on skipthedishes.com and everything was ready to go when we went to pick it up. My partner had been there before and they randomly gave him free dumplings! Everything we've had (subs, vermicelli, dumplings, fresh rolls) has been great and the people working there seem really nice."}
