{"text":"Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice."}
{"text":"I've lived downtown for 15 years and this is my go to place for Chinese. The food is always hot,tasty and you can't beat the price compared to some of the other places downtown. I always get the orange chicken and shrimp fried rice but the appetizer part of the menu is perfect for small get togethers like a game of thrones night."}
{"text":"CHICKEN Lo Mein. I wish I could find any chicken there! No, seriously, there should be at least some noticeable chicken...I will never order from them again! Got a whole pot of oily noodles...

The place is dirty. The cashier would not even nod when I was talking, just like a robot, no \"hi\" or smile. Unfortunately not many other options for Chinese food in downtown but I will go to other places if I needed any Chinese."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality."}
{"text":"They absolute worst Chinese place ever. Placed an order for delivery and they completely messed it up. Forgot a complete order of orange chicken and egg drop soup. Gave us some weird tofu stuff that we didn't order. The stuff they did send was mediocre if that. Called them back and they refused to refund or send out the orange chicken. The lady kept saying \"you got three orders, what else you want.\" So pretty much got ripped off by these guys. Will never recommend to anyone ever."}
{"text":"Very displeased. I use to go here years ago and they were friendly and the food was great. I was in the area and ordered beef fried rice. First of all, I thought the place was closed because it was so dark looking inside.  The lady at the counter was overall rude, I don't know what her problem was. She didn't smile, she wasn't polite at all and overall acted as if I was bothering her. While she was making my food, I noticed a guy sitting ON the FLOOR with what looked like a bucket of chicken meat? He was pulling pieces apart putting it back in the bucket and discarding whatever it was in the trash tin can next to him. Overall it looked unsanitary and gross. I had a weird vibe to just ask for my money back and walk out but I figured I'd give them a chance. She comes back with my food and puts it on the table for me to grab. No \"Thank you, have a nice day\" or ANYTHING. I looked in the bag, no fortune cookie, not even a utensil to eat with. I asked for it and she again acted as if I was asking for too much {whatever}. I get back to my location to grub and find little to NO BEEF in my beef fried rice. I literally counted 7 tiny small and THIN pieces {not even full strips}. The beef itself was tasteless and the rice alone was oily and nasty. The fortune cookie itself was stale! I never in my life had a stale fortune cookie before lol. This place use to be awesome! Food use to be great! The people were nice and friendly! I don't know who is running the store now but they will NEVER get a dime from me again. EVER! I never in my LIFE had to empty everything on a plate to see if there was even ANY MEAT in the food! Deuces!"}
{"text":"For delivery, this place was good. The General Tso's was flavorful, the special fried rice was tasty- could have had a bit more proteins - and the whole chicken wings were large, crispy and juicy. I live downtown and the delivery time was very reasonable considering I ordered at halftime of the Steelers game. We will order from Fu Lai again"}
{"text":"Check out for the \" secret menu\" by asking photos& recommendations :) Great place to taste real Chinese\Szechuan Cuisines! ~~ Suggestion from a 'picky' Chinese"}
{"text":"The Chinese donuts are amazing...... but that's it. I had General Tao's chicken w fried rice, and the chicken wasn't chicken.... I'll forever order the donuts but that's it!"}
{"text":"Ok for a quick lunch, but definitely falls into the genre of \"Dirty Chinese Restaurant\".  Service is quick and I can get a filling lunch for less than $5.  Definitely not fancy, but it tastes good and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Their soups are very good. Best hangover food ever! Delivery took over an hour, but thats the only minus I can think of."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had. We ordered general gso extra spicy and there was absolutely no taste to it. There wasnt even sauce! It was horrible. The fried rice didn't have any vegetable in it and was so bland. The egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful. I called to complain and they hung up on me. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Don't waste your time, order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cheap food but my chicken was burnt. My co-worker's chicken wasn't cooked right. Not gonna order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered in during a concert and it was delivered within the hour. If you know how waterfront looks during an event, you will understand how impressive that is. The lobster lo mien was delicious- substitute the egg noodle got rice noodles and it's even more heavenly. We were in a hotel and they delivered right to our room! Delivers in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I'm a guy that has lived in China, and I frequently go out of my way to eat authentic Chinese food.

If your idea of Chinese food is Orange Chicken and General Tzo's -- this is probably not your restaurant, although I encourage you to be adventurous. 

My wife and I ordered a variety of their off menu selections including dry spicy pork ribs, jalapeño tripe, pork feet, and spare rib spicy soup to name a few.  I want to give special attention to the spicy stomach dish which was the.best.stomach.ever.  (no smell or gamey taste - only tender spicy goodness)

It was a wonderful face numbing and absolutely satisfying experience that I haven't had since my last trip to China.  

My next visit to Pittsburgh will include Fu Lai."}
{"text":"Cheap food without a lot of love. Lunch general tso didn't contain anything but fried chicken and cheap sauce. Hot and sour soup was bland. Fried rice was just fried white rice with nothing else added. It could be better but they skimp on every ingredient possible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. If you are paying $5 for lunch, you're getting a $5 lunch. The lunches are exactly what you're paying for.

They have a secret Chinese menu, but you need to speak Chinese to get it. I occasionally go with a colleague who does all the ordering. If you can get that setup, it is fantastic."}
{"text":"It'd been a few years since I've been to Fu Lai and judging by the more recent reviews, it's become hit or miss.  But I was on Penn Avenue last month and I thought I'd stop in for lunch (and yeah, I'm procrastinating on my reviews here).

I guess I was there on a \"hit\" day 'cos my lunch was pretty decent.  I usually get chicken with vegetables or chicken with peapods at places like this.  So I guess you've gotta stick to the basics when eating here."}
{"text":"The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Worst in the past, present, and future of my life...
The food is a just a combination of rice/noodles and veg/meat and can never be called \"Chinese\", let alone their horrible service and slow serving."}
{"text":"At first glance this is just your typical little Chinese joint serving the usual General Tso's and lo mein, and for the most part those are the things that they advertise. The prices and ambiance complement this impression as well. I wouldn't have given it a passing thought if it weren't for their new paper menu of noodle soups on their window, which is not so typical of American Chinese places. It turns out they offer a number of different soups with different contents, some spicy and others not, and mostly for around $7. This was an absolute steal considering how tasty and hearty these were. The noodles were decently spongy and there was a good amount of meat for the ones we ordered, which were roast pork (??) and spare rib. The former is Cantonese style bbq pork, which is somewhat rare in the city. But it was actually not too shabby, and we might find ourselves coming back to this hole in the wall in the future."}
{"text":"The rice and dumplings were ok. Delivery was fast and friendly, and they were willing to travel to Beechview, which is a plus in my book. the Beef and Scallops lacked in flavor. The Chinese donuts were decent as were the egg rolls. It wasn't great on my end but not as bad as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the family that works and seemingly lives here. The place looks disastrous with duct tape holding the doors in place and plastic flaps like you'd see in a quarantine zone. I ordered my go-to Chinese food meal, General Tsos, and what I received looked and tasted awful. I wish that family the best, but they will not survive with that quality of food."}
{"text":"Not sure about the bad reviews here!! I don't know enough to know for certain but I suspect that the food here is more authentic Chinese style instead of American Chinese style and thus people don't get what they are accustomed to and get upset.  But ANYWAY I think this place is amazing!  Just a little tucked away kind of hole in the wall place you might not notice, but they have the best sesame noodles and I also really like their egg rolls and my son got some soup the other day that looked amazing.  And the lunch prices are great.  I am a vegetarian so can't comment on any of the main meat dishes but the noodles and soups and veggie eggrolls are great!  I feel like this is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The \"chicken\" is dark, fatty, and inedible. Don't miss the 100 pound tub of MSG as you walk in. I paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach, food was then delivered, I took one look at it and threw it out, and left. You should skip this place for sure."}
{"text":"I had dined here a few times over the years.  I tried to purchase lunch on April 19, 2018.  The place looked like it was closed.  There was plastic over the door, but I saw a party dining and went in.  I was met by an unpleasant young woman who told me that only fish was available.  I do not expect to return."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place that delivers to Mt Washington went out of business this past year (ABC Garden), and after living on pizza for several months, I finally gave in to my craving for Chinese and ordered from Fu Lai. It's not that the food was awful. It just doesn't taste good. 

My palate runs from I'll eat and enjoy almost anything to being a foodie. ABC Garden was bad-for-me food that I thought tasted really good. I ordered the same sampling of things from Fu Lai, and enjoyed none of them: 

General Tso's chicken - nothing overtly disgusting and it was edible, but just didn't taste very good. 

Shrimp in lobster sauce - the shrimp were overcooked and probably are like those frozen ones you get in a big five-pound bag at Costco - only much lower quality. The lobster sauce was very gelatinous and had little flavor. It wasn't inedible, but it wasn't good.

Fried Rice (plain) as an accompaniment  to the above - very dry, and little flavor.

Crab rangoon - the filling tasted good - how can you mess up cream cheese? - but the deep-fried crust that wraps it was overdone and tough. ABC Garden used to serve theirs with a tasty sweet red dipping sauce, but no sauce with the ones from Fu Lai.

I also ordered fried dumplings and the wonton soup, but haven't tried those yet. I almost always order enough Chinese food to last for three days, so I'll try those tomorrow. 

I will probably throw out what is left of the General Tso's chicken, the shrimp and lobster sauce and the fried rice, and I can't remember ever not eating everything I've gotten from a restaurant, either as delivery, take-out, or left-overs. Again, not because of anything awful or disgusting, but simply because eating more of it would give me more pain than the pain of throwing out the food I paid for."}
{"text":"If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  
The food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back."}
{"text":"It was just another Saturday night, and Kay was hungry for Chinese food yet again. Wanting fresh Yelp material, I lurked about online, searching for a restaurant we hadn't tried before that would deliver to our domain of Beechview. 

Surprisingly, Downtown's oft maligned Fu Lai offered to bring us dinner, and it took less that 45 minutes! 

Our egg rolls were packed with shrimp and not lettuce. 

The steamed dumplings were doughy, heavy, and well-filled with pork. We also ordered a helping of the fried version, and found that they were almost as good, the chewy potsticker wrapping detracting from them slightly. In fact, I'll probably only be ordering them steamed from now on as I've finally decided once and for all that I prefer them that way. 

The complimentary cheese wontons were a wonderfully tart, crispy-creme dream of a snack.

Supposedly a Cantonese dish, I had the Sub Gum Wonton which had no actual wontons in it (I suspect the cheese ones were intended to accompany them). Truthfully, I really couldn't complain much about this hodgepodge of vegetables, langostinos (called 'lobster' on the menu), chicken breast, shrimp, and roasted pork. The thin flaps of pork were the standout and practically broke down on the tip of my tongue like the best pho. My chicken was far from \"dark, fatty, and inedible\" as one vengeful Yelper put it. I also tasted no excessive MSG in anything I ate, either.

The Chinese Donuts (a.k.a. Youtiao?) were a fine dessert fit for carnivals. The blobs of buttery bronze dough were dusted with granulated sugar and vanished in the mouth like cotton candy. 

Kay wasn't as enthusiastic about her Fu Lai meal, and I too was prepared to write a scathing review of my own. Good food will always cause me to sheath my sword, however. 

P.S. The person I talked with on the phone was relatively easy to understand, and the fellow who successfully delivered our food was downright cordial and seemed genuinely happy that we chose his restaurant over all others that evening."}
{"text":"don't order the lunch special here. It tastes not good. Try their Chinese lunch. 
It is about 7 with soup but tastes a lot better. I heard the beef noodle is good too."}
{"text":"Despite mixed reviews I wanted to try this. I spend 40 dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor. This food was made with obligation, not love."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 10 years or so, starting back in my art institute days. The place has stayed stable over the years although the food has dropped a little in quality since the staff changed. But you still can't beat the two entree lunch for $4.92!"}
{"text":"I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. 
SO... my fiancé & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.
Everything we've ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty sure that's totally accurate. 
I order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super nice too.
One time they forgot our steamed dumplings - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super apologic & really sweet.
I know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give the happy reviews when they're pleased typically.
SO, I say - give it a try people - order the peppered chicken - it's excellent - you're welcome in advance & if you're happy - write a happy review. :)"}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it. They were very quick (food ordered and delivered in under 25 minutes). The only thing is, my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didn't have one vegetable in them. The noodles were very bland and almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's was less than subpar. The egg roll's didn't even have shrimp in them. Next time, I'll listen to the reviews."}
