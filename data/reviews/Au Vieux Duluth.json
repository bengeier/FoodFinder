{"text":"One of the few BYOW places found in the west island. This place went through some renovations from the last time I was here. It does look much nicer and there are many booths. I came for dinner on friday and was lucky to snag a booth. Definitely make reservations since it is packed. The service was good and swift. I ordered the walleye fillet fish which was tasty, not dry. It comes with salad, rice and potatoes. It was a huge portion which I was not able to finish. It is priced at $20. The crowd was either families or over the age of 50. On the way out I took a candy at the front, it is not mint but instead a green hard candy."}
{"text":"A nice place, well served and clean. The service is good and up to the standards. The place is family friendly and the food is good.  If you don't know where to go and you happen to be in the area then this is a nice place to go to.  Nothing very special about it, but overall I would go there again."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday supper. We were a large group of about 40 people. On the plus side, the service was great and the food came out quickly.   The negative part...the food! I had the feta appetizer which was great, and the chicken brochette as my main meal. For $16, I would expect a decent brochette but it was bland and dry, I had to order an extra side of tzatziki just to be able to dip it in some sort of sauce to make it edible. In hindsight, I should have sent it back but I didn't want to cause a fuss at my friends party. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for my anniversary dinner with my wife. She ordered the scampi and loved it. I ordered the 12oz new York cut. I asked for medium rare. But received blue. Sent it back. Got back a barely rare steak. Luckily our waiter who understood that the kitchen can't cook steak for the life of them. Didn't charge me for my meal. I left a nice tip for him. And left some comments for the kitchen staff. If it hadn't of been for our awesome waiter. This place would've received 1 star. But I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love the butterfly garlic shrimp. A bit over priced though for what it is. Last time i went and got scampi shrimp it really wasn't good. The shrimp was tiny with barely any meat inside. I won't be going back for a little while."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since my kids are small so for over 18 years.  The staff is great, food is perfect.  Personally l LOVE their butterfly shrimps.  It always a great family moment."}
{"text":"Au vieux Duluth de Joliette!!!!  Nourriture délicieuse et bon service par les serveuses.  Seul bémol c'est que nous étions six placé sur une table à quatre, nous avons demandé pour une table supplémentaire on nous a dit que Tous les tables étaient réservés alors que nous étions seul dans le restaurant .  Nous avons donc eu notre repas  tassé comme des sardines .  De plus il n'avait même pas de place pour les assiette à pain sur la table . Nous avons dû faire retirer toutes nos Verres d'eaux pour se faire suffisamment de place sur les tables. Je ne recommande pas cet endroit pour les groupes de plus de quatre personnes"}
