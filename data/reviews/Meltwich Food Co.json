{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall is extremely underrated. They have this poutine that's loaded with absolutely everything you could think of. I've been here twice (maybe three times?) and every time I go, I'm amazed by how wonderfully comforting the poutine is. Looking forward to trying other things at this restaurant, but this place genuinely has the best poutine I've ever tried."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. My girlfriend and I got uber eats delivery and I have nothing good to say. First they shorted us a drink... OK people make mistakes, im not impressed but I'll get over it. But here is the real kicker. We started eating because we were starving. After almost finishing my big messy bacon avocado sandwich I noticed my bacon was nearly raw. Yes I took a picture for proof. Who the fuck serves any kind of uncooked pork??? I prayed I would be ok, but guess what I got food poisoning. I spent my night with my head in the toilet with a savage stomach ache. Thanks alot meltwich. I will never get anything from them again and I strongly recommend nobody else take the risk!"}
{"text":"Very smokey in here and my first bad review due to no taste at all in burger, secondly I had to get burger redone 3 times an still wrong :(.    Poutine is great and grilled cheese any retard can make."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was mediocre at best. 

The food was bland and the staff kept goofing around while making the food so it took longer than needed to. 

At one point they put my milk shake by the door and did tell me it was ready. It off to the side so anyone could pick it up and walk out. 

The burger was flavorless meat and sloppy mess.

The poutine was ok the gravy was chunky like it had been sitting all day. 

My fiancé had the tuna sandwich and it was bland. It was suppose to have spicy mayo on it. Nothing. Not even a little kick. 

Lastly the grilled cheese they are \"known\" for was tasteless and dry. Anyone can make a grilled cheese but wow did they screw it up. 

Save your money go else where."}
{"text":"First review but been here a few times. Every time I've come, the place is always smokey and hot. During the summer it's so humid you're practically sweating in your food (at that point I'd rather just take it \"to go\"). 

I came with my fiancée. He ordered the godfather, I had the bacon avocado and we shared large fries (see pics!). It came up to $25. 

Staff there were neither friendly or rude. They were just kinda there...doing their job and that's it...

Our sandwiches were actually pretty good! I mean, it's definitely something that you can make yourself but when you're hungry and it's getting late you can't go wrong! Loved the fries, yumm! They were crispy just the way I like it!

Also they were making a lot orders for UBER EATS....for those that might be interested!"}
{"text":"A good lunch option if you're in the area. I came just after the lunch rush (1pm), so it was quiet and I could take my time ordering. The menu is a bit confusing, the placement of items had me smacking my head with the \"why didn't I see that before I ordered?\" thought.

The daily lunch special (beside the register) was certainly a good option, but if you'd like something a bit lighter, the half sandwich and soup option is in the snack panel to the right? That's what I ended up getting, and it was more than enough for me! I was so full before I even finished it, but grilled cheese sandwiches just aren't as good if you keep them for later so I toughed it out and ate everything (I know, I deserve a medal lol). The soup is amazing - so savoury and flavourful. The grilled cheese sandwich was good, but nothing amazing. Perhaps I should try one of the specialty ones again to get a better gauge. 

The place is comfy with a few four-seater spots and a cafeteria style ordering vibe. Decent option for lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If you are a real foodie, you won't appreciate this place. Meltwich Food Co can't make grilled cheese sandwiches or hamburgers - and that's all they do!  The \"Godfather\" meltwich tastes like greasy processed, nitrate filled chicken, and oily provolone cheese substitute. It's $8.99 + tax!  It's just gross tasting.  The hamburger with bacon is very small, and extremely salty with no toppings except ketchup.  How do you screw up a hamburger?  The bun is unimpressive and the ground meat is tough.  We ordered it through Foodora, but going in and eating can't be any better."}
{"text":"First time going, the staff were helpful and prompt with preparing my order. Ordered the Tatooed Chicken at the suggestion of the staff and was pleasantly surprised by the combination of flavours. Sandwich was a bit soggy due to the tomatoes, but overall a great place to get grilled cheese and a pleasant overall customer experience."}
{"text":"A convenient place to get a quick sandwich, but don't expect the best. For the price I expected more of a meal, but nevertheless I enjoyed my visit. I will come back if in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food. $5 for a simple grilled cheese."}
{"text":"A complete failure. Sent me a burger with no lettuce, no tomato no mayo etc. Literally two grilled cheese buns and a patty flung in between. Absolute failure. Poutine was gross and cold. How that was even possible was beyond my comprehension. My coworkers sandwich was ok. But nothing great. Not a repeat uber order for me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found a hair in his food, and I received a sandwich without the one topping I actually asked for, leaving me with a sandwich I could have easily made at home for a fraction of the price. We contacted the company to see if they could make up for their issues considering we live across the street from them, but the woman we spoke with (Barb) said the compensation was in the mail, meanwhile it's been over 2 months with no mail from them. I contacted Barb again to let her know we haven't and it's been almost a month again with no response from her after letting her know. Let down by the store and the external management. So disappointing. Employees generally aren't too happy to be working there either, it seems."}
{"text":"Grabbed a 'Mac Attack' on white bread to go. The taste was very unassuming and forgettable, which was unexpected given the contents."}
{"text":"We were in the plaza, hungry, thought of trying this place,it wasn't busy , first thing we noticed that the breads were on the counter displayed for customers to choose. It was weird, the guy who was making our sandwiches, didn't even look up to ask  what we wanted in it or anything extra we wanted on our sandwich, anyways, we  ordered grilled sandwich with tomato and sriracha sauce, another grilled sandwich with chicken, bell peppers, with chipotle sauce and a wrap with olives, sweet onion sauce, chicken and lettuce. 

The grilled sandwich was loaded with cheddar cheese, looks like he used the thickest slice on the bread, which made the bread look Orange. The other sandwich was so spicy and again, loaded with thick cheddar cheese, the Sparta wrap was a disaster, it was just falling apart because it was stuffed too much. Prices are not too bad,from $5 to $ 10 and they have specials too but , Na, I am not going there again."}
{"text":"Great tasty sandwiches! Nice and friendly staff. A good place to get a quick bite for relatively cheap. I had the tattoo chicken, it was really good but didn't quench my hunger. Overall great place if you're in the area and would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible first experience. Ordered food via UberEats. Spinach salad was expired (smelled like ammonia) portion sizes were mediocre, ketchup was expired.. What the hell is going on? Wheres the integrity? Food quality? So I'm assuming if something is expired then its ok to serve it if its a delivery, or if the customer doesnt know about it. Absolutely ridiculous, I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I'd give it -5 stars if I could. 

In a nutshell 
-the soup and Mac n cheese were half full in already small containers
-the lettuce was soggy on the grilled cheese
-they left the cheese wrapper on my sandwich. ON ... as in I bit into it
-their number on the app I used is out of order, as well as the numbers provided on the internet
-I emailed my complaint
-a lady emailed me back apologizing saying she'd send me a gift card. No gift card. Emailed again. She apologized again sending a new gift card. No gift card in the mail...again
-she blamed a trainee for the problem
-she never followed up after she set a meeting supposedly 
-I was able to refund my food off just eat.ca, which was the only good part in this experience 

Terrible service. Terrible food. Terrible portions. Impossible to find the actual address. No working phone numbers. 

Their website says they're humble and want to make the greatest tasting grilled cheeses in the world.... never going to happen."}
{"text":"The food here is just average but the price isn't.  One sandwich, small poutine and coke was 15$!!!! This is nuts (view photo I posted)"}
{"text":"Really good grilled cheese sandwiches and open really late on weekends which is nice. Service was friendly for 1am, and the food was all good except the poutine which I split with a friends. Totally bland and would not recommend unless your benchmark for good poutine is McD's. Cool joint open late in the heart of Streetsville, perfect for midnight-3am snacking."}
