{"text":"Great food and service!!! Thank you Ragin Cajun!!!  Our server Gina was a delight!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was here!!  A Cajun Sports Bar and in Scottsdale??  What the heck?!  

Well to my surprise we found this place which is not that far from Tempe.  I was with several of my friends, which they had never tried cajun cooking before.  This place is more of a sports bar with big screen TV's everywhere and they had a live band playing when we went.  We had a great time! 

The food seems to be very authentic cajun!  Everything tasted great and they have Louisiana's finest beer - Abita on tap!  I had the shrimp etouffee with a bowl of gumbo.  Both were outstanding!! My friend tried their shrimp poboy with a side of seasoned fries and she also had a cup of their gumbo.  She loved everything!  

Ragin Cajun is added to our \"places to go eat/drink\" with friends!!"}
{"text":"A little bit of Louisiana right here in Scottsdale. I just discovered this place last night and WILL be a regular. They have some of the best Cajun food that I have ever had. The staff was extremely friendly and introduced me to a few beers and drinks that I had never heard of that all left me wondering what else I've been missing out on. This place really is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night to see a friends band play.  Had a good time.  The food was amazing!  We ordered the special which was catfish (which was sooo good!), homemade chips and hush puppies.  It was magnificent!  

There seemed to be 2 girls on the floor, a bartender, and the Manager (who was nice)  We came in got a table and sat there for, what I consider, quite a while, probably about 15 - 20 minutes before we were greeted, and asked if we were helped.  Finally someone came to help us, she took our drink order and got us menus.  So we decide what we want.  And we wait some more. 

All in all, this is a great place.  I think the service could be a little quicker, it wasn't bad, just slow going.  One of the servers walked passed us 3 times, then finally ANOTHER server had to come and help us when she saw us.  I was disappointed at the speed of service, but the service we did get was good.  I just think, that one server probably knocked it down, otherwise it would have been a solid 5.  She cleaned 2 tables that were on either side of us, and saw us sitting there, no menu's or anything.  She didn't even say 'someone will be right with you'  she just completely ignored us!  That is rude, and normally this would be a deal breaker for me! 

That being said, good music, good food, good atmosphere.  I will over look the waitress ignoring us one time.  Everyone has an off night."}
{"text":"I came here to check out a buddy of mine's band playing (didn't eat)... Walking in, the first thing you notice is that there's lots of space, plenty of room to hang out. I get tired of joints that squish 150 people into an old strip mall store-turned club, but this place is really 3 separate rooms, which makes for a very comfortable environment. Room 1 is to the right, where you can hide from the band and shoot some pool. Room 2 to the left, you are behind the bar, and you can watch a game and hold a conversation and the band isn't in your face. Room 3 has a small stage and dancing area where bands perform. It's almost a perfect setup. Bartenders were really friendly and generous. Plus, this is a far cry from most \"Scottsdale bars\" in that there is no pretension or snobbery whatsoever, and they host a wide variety of musical groups that don't play loud, techno drool. As Arnold would say... \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"We first came to this bar to play their free poker on Thursday nights, which is a pretty casual fun. The place looks kinda sketchy on the outside, but the inside is super cute and nice. They have pool tables, a nice bar, TVs, and karaoke on certain nights.  I didn't order any drinks, but my boyfriend did and he quickly made friends with the bartender, so I'll assume he's nice.  Plus a few times we went back he would say hi to me. Kinda sad we've been there 3 times and they already know us (they actually recognized us from the 1st time we went back). I guess that says a lot about of their business...

Now about their food! From what we've tried, I can assume at least 90% of their menu is absolutely delicious. We've had their gumbo, etouffee, RC po boy, wings, and jambalaya. The gumbo & etouffee were superb. I didn't care much for the po boy (although I'm not a big sandwich person), but my boyfriend loved it. Their wings are different, but in a very good way. The cajun ones have an interesting spice I can't quite describe. The BBQ ones taste like ribs :). The only thing neither of us quite cared for was the jambalaya. The taste was okay, but it didn't taste like jambalaya. It was more like a dirty rice with sausage. It didn't have tomato or shrimp in it, like I'm used to with jambalaya. Like another reviewer said, it was dry, and I think that's probably because of the lack of tomato sauce. Oh yes, and the fries are to die for! (Especially dipped in their deliciously creamy ranch - ask for it!)

The rolls that come with the entrees are really good. From another reviewer, it seems they used to serve cornbread, so I guess this is new. Now that I think of it, I don't think we even got rolls our first time there...

I would have actually given this review a 4 for a few reasons. First, their food is delicious, but as far as Cajun goes, we prefer Baby Kay's. Unfortunately, Baby Kay's is just too far of a drive for us and Ragin Cajun is 10 times better than Cajun Seafood Corner in Mesa (which has okay food and crappy service). Second, because they are pretty new, it doesn't seem like they have their system down. We've witnessed a few mistakes (and got quite well compensated for it!) and just the whole food order process seems a bit messy. They are usually very fast about bringing out the food though...

The reason why I gave this 5 stars instead of 4 is because well, their fries, and the family that owns it is very nice. Their price is also very agreeable!

I apologize for the super long review, but I hope that helped! I think it's definitely a place to check out if you want some good food, a good atmosphere, and a good time (if you go for poker - otherwise the bar just seems very empty)"}
{"text":"Crawfish! Turtle Soup! Oyster Po Boys! Gumbo! Daiquiris! Abita!

Had a fantastic lunch at Ragin' Cajun and could not be happier!

When we first drove up and I realized what building it was - I was hesitant to go in. I had been to the former incarnation - Mardi Gras - a few times - and with the exception of one drunken fun night, never had a good experience. The food was overpriced and mediocre. And the owner was one of the biggest jerks I've ever met.
Happily - Ragin' Cajun has new owners, a new menu, and a new attitude! All HUGE improvements.

The food is fresh, well seasoned and fairly priced. The owner and his wife (and his dad) are all charming - and I enjoyed chatting with the kitchen staff on a break - they're the real deal - plucked right out of Louisiana Cajun Country - and they know how to feed their guests.

Welcome to town, Freddy - looking forward to many years of good eats with you!"}
{"text":"Great southern food, great atmosphere.  I wanted to try the alligator, but they were out due to the hurricane, so I'll be back soon for sure.  I had the red beans and rice - so delish!!!! It came with the best dinner roll I've ever tasted - ever!  My hubby had the catfish special, which was also great.  They had a ton of TV's, and when we were there LSU was playing so it was fun to see all the fans at the bar.  After the game, they were setting up for live music, which we didn't stay for, but the stage area was really cool.  Also, the women's bathroom was super swanky (think red light district boudoir)."}
{"text":"People are awesome!  Food is reminiscent of my Louisiana days.  The crawfish were excellent!"}
{"text":"Flavors and libations from Louisiana meet hole-in-the wall Scottsdale sports bar.

We came in during a Saints game. They were losing and the scattered patrons at the bar weren't happy. At first glance, RC is your average looking dive bar with a Cajun theme. A rough looking group of biker regulars at the bar, several friendly looking customers and a very welcoming staff. We got hugs on the way out!

We ordered three beers. Amber Abita (my personal favorite) is a somewhat watery but refreshing light beer. Purple Haze has a medium-strength fruity flavor that we ordered because of the name and I remembered seeing it in New Orleans. The most interesting was the Andygator. It has a peach/apricot aftertaste with a hollow sweetness. I'm looking forward to trying out their other selections.

For food, we started with the corn nuggets - cooked well and not too corny with the excellent honey mustard sauce. My friend ordered the Bubba Burger which is your standard double cheeseburger with cajun fry's that looked nice and crispy. They were out of the Jambalaya, but I was recommended the Crawfish Etoufee. Wow! Delicious and medium spicy seafood sauce with plenty of tender crawfish served on rice. Match that with the buttered rolls and I was in southern food heaven. The dishes were delivered by two people, who looked like maybe the owners and/or the chef, who genuinely wanted to know if we liked our dinner. Talk about hospitality!

We chatted with the manager and the waitress for a while, who was actually from the south. Learned a lot about the beers and can't wait to go back to try more of that southern cooking."}
{"text":"Yuck!!  One star is a gift the food is awful  the  service worse. The only redeeming value this place has are the televisions. The jambalaya doesn't even have any seafood in it!  No way will we be returning"}
{"text":"I was hopeful this new cajun bar would have something good to offer. I stopped in one night for a beer and decided to sample the food as well. They do have Abita on draft but that's about the extent of their cajun authenticity. The menu is incredibly limited but does have the standard cajun dishes one may expect. I tried the jambalaya which was bland and pasty and served with what was supposed to be corn bread. If the food wasn't bad enough on it's own, the rude & condescending staff made it worse. Needless to say, I won't be going back here unless there is a significant turn around in the kitchen and management. There are other decent options in the valley for cajun food. And much better options in the immediate area for a sports bar, music venue or good beer."}
{"text":"A great new Cajun Sports Bar just opened last week near the corner of McDowell and Hayden Rd."}
{"text":"I was on the fence between what to rate this. 2?3? Ahh... I'll be generous and stick with my 3 since the owner (I think) and the bartender was eager to help and make the experience a nice first visit.  I ordered the shrimp po boy thinking that was a safe choice along with some alligator bites since they wouldn't let me get them as my side so I settled with cajun fries as my side which were awesome and ate all of! So the alligator bites being my first time I kind of wish I could go to Florida to try them there my first time but I was eager to try them regardless. First bite reminded me of a cross between chicken and fish with a very different texture and chewyness.  Not bad not my favorite but it went well with the sauce.  I didn't finish them because I was trying out the chips and which were overloaded with salt. I'm not a huge salt fiend but salt as a slight flavoring not in excess. Makes me nauseated.

That being said...the shrimp po'  boy.... had a very shrimpy or seafood taste about it that lingers on your tongue when you don't want it too. I make shrimp a lot for Jambalaya and never have that flavor. Almost makes me want to go buy different shrimps so o know what it is to avoid that aftertaste in the future. I severely hate telling owners that I don't love their food that I ordered. But since this place is so new and no one else has said anything about it it was a huge risk and should have stuck with the Cajun Burger instead. Which by the looks of it didn't look exactly like a thick juicy Patty IMO.   All I can think about are those corn nuggets. Mmm mmm mmmmmm! 
I will give them another chance some day.  When someone pulls my arm again to go."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place by the outside decor, it is AWESOME on the inside! Great service, too! Very friendly, good food as well :-)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent cajun food for a sports bar. Place is your typical neighborhood dive though with some sketchy looking regulars.  They had Abita beers to go along with the food. TV's everywhere."}
{"text":"I stopped in to check out The Ragin' Cajun , I heard good reviews on the food, service and how nice the place were. And yes it did live up to what I had heard, The food was great, staff was very friendly, and the cook even made my order special by making me sum kick-ass hot bar-b-q wings not on the menu....And some of the live music is great also ,like Chuck Hall band and The Blues Review Band ....If you really want somthing new ,check out The Ragin' Cajun.....Mike A."}
