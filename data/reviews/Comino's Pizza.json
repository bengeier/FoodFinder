{"text":"Although not the best pizza I've ever had, it is the best I've had in Canada in a long time. I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery at 11pm (1 hour before closing), dealt with a very nice person on the other line, and received the pizzas within 20 minutes of ordering. The pizzas themselves had a decent sauce, ample amount of toppings, and a thick crust however it was grease-free which is something almost impossible to find north of the border. The grease-free aspect REALLY made this pizza great as you can then actually taste the toppings."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great price. We don't order from anyone else anymore.

I have used them to feed parties multiple times and everyone is always really impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, excellent price! Can not go wrong with this place. Always fresh.  This is our go to place for pizza, driving from North Oshawa we pass several other places to get there but it is always worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza - IMO the best pizza inDependent pizza joint in Whitby.  Great taste and service.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Price is really good. I get a large and 2 drinks every week.
good delivery time, and they are very friendly people. 
I will always come back to them."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best unknown pizza places in the Durham region.  They use fresh everything (which I'm big on) and they do something to the dough that makes it thick but light.  Yummy!  They have good wings (fresh not frozen) and wedges - we always get the combo.  

We've had lunch there a few times but have only had the chicken fingers and fries which are great.

Great prices for great food - can't go wrong.

Seriously it took me two years once I moved here to find good pizza.  

Try it you'll love it... And if you don't I'll take your left overs."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here once it was quick and amazing. And so many sauces to pick from. I got a lg pizza special and was ready in less then 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered 2xs to give it a chance. Both times ordered different toppings. Both times it was awful. It must be the sauce they use. Won't be calling back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza around. I've been ordering from them religiously for 8 years now. Same friendly owners from the start that welcome new customers and treat regulars like family. The food is fantastic and fresh, and the deals are great. Pizza dough is so soft and the wings are the right flavour/size. They dont skimp on pizza toppings. They deliver just about everywhere around this area: Whitby, Brooklin, Oshawa, Ajax....."}
{"text":"I ordered from here looking for something outside of your typical pizza franchise.  It had good reviews so I tried it.  The pizza was good, with just the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings. Price was fantastic and ready in under 20 mins."}
{"text":"If you order XL pizza, 2 cans of pop for free.
Nice local business. Large pizzaz.
Once, they messed up my order and gave me somebody else's pizza. I discovered home only (takeout). Still ate it -- discovered something new. Owner called to apologize - they discovered the mistake.

Never went there again but still consider it a very decent and honest place."}
{"text":"We always order from here.  Love the pizza.  We always order spicy Italian sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese.   Always consistent good pizza.  We don't order feom anyplace else.  The price is great and they are always friendly upon pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE... I tried to order 2 Panzerotti's from this place, they always seem to rip you off with the price.  Even tho 2 of these cost the same as a pizza they charge you extra if you want them delivered (not including delivery which is normal). I tried to have her explain why they charge extra to deliver these even those pizza is the same price and she couldn't give me a proper answer. What difference is it if I spend $18 on Panzerotti's or $18 on a Pizza?? I accept the $4 deliver but I do not accept being charged more just because it's not a pizza yet the price is the same. Too make matters worst she hung up the phone on me, what business does that??? They have good food, but this terrible customer service will prevent me from ordering from this place ever again. They need to be better customer service people and explain to people why it cost them more money for someone just cause it's not a PIzza and not hang up on them. They were trying to charge me over $5 more just cause these are Panzo's being delivered, I have allowed it several other times but finally questioned it this time and got this rude response!!!!! $5 over several orders adds up quick!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to order from them all the time the pizza is not the best but their prices are fair for the quality untill one night they took 2hours for my delivery I had been calling them after an hour said they were on their way it didn't show up for an hour later and then naturally it was cold and just not very good I still paid full price for it since we were hungry I called them and told them I was disappointed with their service and being lied to about them saying they were on their way the owner basically told me too bad we have the best prices and will not issue a refund or credit for the pizza I like a fair deal as much as the next person but what I don't like is owners that don't appreciate their customers I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I tried you guys again and you disappointed me.
They roll their dough thin now, crust is thick around the edges but the bottom is noticeably thinner. 
I won't buy pizza from you guys again, that's unfortunate to see you guys cheat your customers"}
{"text":"Great pizza - authentic, and tasty. And great potato wedges too. We use to like dominos and pizza nova but now this is our favorite!"}
{"text":"From the name, I can only assuming it must have been an old Domino's location. Tonight was the first time I ordered from here. And to my surprise they actually deliver up to Brooklin (when a number of other pizzerias do not). It was like Domino's fluffy crust, with better pizza sauce, and a heck of alot more toppings. The wings were pretty good, and the potato wedges were just okay (no Mary Brown's). I will definitely order from here again. Better than all your typical franchise places around. Giving it 3.5 - 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and Dad's favorite pizza place in Whitby. My Dad loves their wings too. Tons of cheese on their pizza. Great place with friendly staff. Very good pizza!"}
{"text":"Best little pizzeria in Durham!  Great food and prices!  If you are looking for authentic pizza, wings and wedge fries... this is the place!  Be sure to try their panzerotti as well, it is HUGE!"}
{"text":"The price was great, fast delivery and very tasty. Sadly a hair was found on one - mistakes happen but it was a work gathering so it tossed a bad spin. I would still come again to try again!"}
{"text":"We ordered a whole bunch of party size pizzas, wings, wedges and a big salad for the whole office on a Saturday. I'm not a big fan of pizza but I obviously tried a whole bunch around little Italy and Toronto in general - even went on a pizza hopping tour (don't recommend...fell asleep half way through with a heavy belly) - and i must say this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had!!

We got a veggie pizza - tomatoes, pepper, onions. So much cheese. So much veg. So much goodness.
We got chicken pineapple - so much chicken, pineapple and hot peppers. It was delicious and i don't even like pineapples in food. Oh and hot chilies on it too. 

Then there was Canadian - bacon, some other kind of meat, onions and mushrooms. This was my fave, so much meaty goodness!!!

Wings weren't spicy - but I don't think I would go to a pizza place to have spicy wings anyway. All Stars yo. Anyway, the sweet heat were the best with chilies. 

THE PRIZE WINNER WERE THE POTATO WEDGES!!! hoollyyyy goooood. They were crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside and just the bomb. 

The salad was better than most pizza places, they don't just throw a bunch of leaves and tomato halves in it. This had onions and carrots and radishes, and everything was nicely cut up. 

Delivery boy was maaaaad cute too. Got everything here on time, fresh and with a sparkly white smile ;)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place. We eat a lot of pizza because my wife is from Buffalo and Buffalo has some great pizza places. Fair amount of toppings, and not greasy at all. The price point is great, so we will be ordering pizza again."}
{"text":"Tired this pizza by chance last night.  When I called I was a little worries at what I'd be getting.  Though friendly on the phone a but hard to understand.  Once the pizza and wings arrived I was shocked at how amazing this pizza is.  Crust is thick with lots of flavour, lots of cheese and toppings, not sure if they messed up and gave me extra or not.  The wings were meaty and tasty.  And the price was cheap.  Found my new pizza place."}
{"text":"There is sauce, cheese and whatever else you wanted on dough. Looks great in pictures, that's about it. Worst pizza I had, in Oshawa."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pizza. I tried the standard cheese and pepperoni pizza at Putting Edge Whitby at the birthday party. The crust was extremely dry and the overall taste was below average. I believe they are the Pizza Partner of Putting Edge."}
{"text":"I saw Comino's had a couple good reviews and I hadn't heard of it so decided to give er a try.

First off the people at the counter were very polite and helpfull and the place was quite clean looking. I chuckled a bit at the name Comino's as I pictured a little old Italian couple running it but the owners are obviously not Italian.

Anyway..the Pies... ordered a medium one topping for my daughter which was only $4.99 (what a deal) and a large 4 item for $9.99 (another deal) and they were prepared quickly and ready in 15 minutes after a trip through there conveyor style oven.

Taste - Overall decent and tasty. The crust was a bit thick but was soft and they didn't cheap out on topping and the sauce had good flavour.

Conclusion: Great value and a decent product but I cant say its a 5 star yelp review, however I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, low price, and friendly staff.  It's my new favorite pizza place in the area until I find better. My only wish is that it had a bit more flavor.  I find myself needing the dipping sauce for that extra deliciousness."}
{"text":"Love this pizza.  Probably my favourite in the region. Crust is thick but airy, sauce is seasoned well but not over seasoned. The wings are good too, and the owners are friendly.  I can't recommend Comino's enough."}
