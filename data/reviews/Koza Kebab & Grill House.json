{"text":"New Turkish restaurant on the south side of Center Point shopping mall.  Ayran, lahmacun, Adana Kebab awesome.  After that Kunefe would be an ideal finish."}
{"text":"This place opened in June 2015. The entrance is only from the outside of the mall, on the South side, near where The Bay is.  The food is terrific, authentic Turkish fare. Servings are plentiful, the waitstaff knowledgeable and happy to discuss ingredients and answer any questions. There is both sit-down and take-away options. Very reasonably priced. On Saturdays they open at 11am so in future we'll do our shopping first, then enjoy a relaxing lunch with bottomless Turkish tea."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. A little hard to find because it might now be Laffa Laffa or something..."}
{"text":"If you are doner/shawarma fan, you must try this place and you would never go back to your average neighbourhood shop again. Great service, nice decoration and clean place. I had a beef doner plate with salad. The sign still says \"Laffa Laffa\", so keep that in mind, otherwise you cant find the place. Entrance is from parking lot of shopping mall."}
{"text":"Great spot for kebob and mixed grill, flavors were on point, meat was nice and juicy and great value for money. Would recommend for a good dinner at home or dine in. Also note the location is accessible from outside the mall so you can easily get in and out."}
{"text":"Great Turkish food. The restaurant is very clean and service is great....if you are looking for a turkish meal try this place out. I had the adana kabab; portion size is good and good value for your dollars.  TIP. Is located outside the mall near entrance #6"}
{"text":"After eating at most of the Turkish establishments in the area over the last few months, I've began to get a handle in rating the food. The pide and kunefe dessert here is made to order. Both the pide and the kunefe are good. However, the doner plate is lacking. My chicken was cold and dry. The rice did not taste fresh. Although the service was good the first time I went, the service was not close in meeting that the second time around. If you're set on eating Turkish, there may be other places that does it better."}
{"text":"(4.5 / 5) Delicious, reasonably priced Turkish cuisine. We ordered the beef doner and beyti kebab (must try!), and both were finely executed. Portions were generous, and it was appreciated that sauces (refills available) were served on the side.   We also ordered a spinach pie, which tasted great but we could tell it had been sitting for a while. The pie pastry had become slightly soggy, and it could've been served warmer. It would've definitely been amazing fresh out of the oven though.  Service was friendly and attentive as well, although it wasn't that packed when we dined here.   The complimentary appetizer platter before and Turkish tea after the main dishes were also a fine touch. Appetizer platter had hummus, olives, eggplant, and mushrooms. Tea came with a jar of sugar cubes you could add to taste.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Located between the exterior entrances of Pickled Barrel & Congee Queen, this Turkish restaurant was such a delicious surprise! The portions are generous and service is fantastic.  It's not easy to find a restaurant which cooks with such genuine interest in making sure their food quality is the best, and their service shows care for their customers.   We ordered Iskander Kebab & Chicken Doner, both of which were amazingly delectable. The meat was not too salty, but spiced enough for us to not notice the gamey flavour usually found in lamb dishes. The chicken was moist and flavorful, not to mention the mouth-watering garlic sauce and cucumber sauces that accompanied the meal.   It's restaurants like these that make us feel so lucky to be living in a multi-cultural city like Toronto!"}
