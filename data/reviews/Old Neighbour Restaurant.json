{"text":"Nice small restaurant serving plump juicy steamed pork buns at a great value of $7.5 for 10 We ordered a beef wrap, beef noodle in soup and the family favorite pork buns for 2 people when I cuda wuda shuda ordered 3 rounds of those mean steam buns  If you happen to locate this slightly secluded eatery then I suggest you stop by, however do so before the dinner times as it did get a little crowded with lots of families who seemed to be seasoned veterans at ordering only steamed buns"}
{"text":"Good baozi!  Reminds me of being in a small alley shop in Beijing, sitting with locals."}
{"text":"There is nothing like the stir-fry green onion pancakes (??) here. How I love their Northern China cuisine."}
{"text":"I wouldn't expect much if you're into decor and such.  This is like an Asian street stall restaurant in a strip mall in Scarborough.    This place is good for dumplings and baos/buns.  The side dishes were just meh.  I really liked the steamed dumplings because they were representative of home style cooking.  Solid handmade dumpling wrappers.    The baos/buns were particularly soft and fluffy.  Fresh, pillowy goodness.   As for the side dishes, the julienned potatoes were just too salty to me.  They also lacked the acidity of some vinegar.    The other side dish we ordered was the cold bean noodle with cucumber.  Although it had a good balanced sauce of garlic, sesame paste, etc. it lacked ingredients.  This dish should be comprised of way more toppings to be mixed in.  Egg omelette, wood ear mushrooms...  Anyways, it was kinda skimpy.   I would definitely come back for the dumplings and baos/buns.  The chive pockets were really good too."}
{"text":"It is small.  It is a bit grubby looking.  The food comes out slower than you would expect as I think they're cooked when you order.  I think it is family owned.  It is so darned delicious!!  We always over order at this northern Chinese restaurant, leaving completely stuffed and satisfied.  Soupy xiao long bao! Pan-fried dumplings! Steamed, fluffy, yummy buns!  I am salivating dreaming of a northern Chinese food heaven.  Forget the pan-fried green onion pancakes though, they are mediocre.   At $6.99/$7.99 per 10 buns, it is good value when you leave so full.  A bit of a hole in the wall, and without the crowds or decor like Ding Tai Fung."}
{"text":"Food here was mediocre to good. I came here with my dad for lunch. I personally thought the \"Braised pig elbow pancake\" was done very well. The panfried buns were very filling. I thought the food was just a little overpriced considering the poor customer service, poor bathroom facility and dull interior decor."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place, that's worth a visit. Left satisfied without breaking the bank.   The Xiao Long Bao (soup filled dumpling) was on point, but I know some would have preferred a thinner skin. Different strokes for different folks! The pot stickers was so juicy on the inside, yummy! Lastly the noodle in the braised beef noodle soup was nice and chewy (the way I like it), but the soup could defiantly use a bit more flavor and more meat (a little stingy).  I waited 20-25min on a Friday night; not sure if normal. Will be back for the soup filled dumpling for sure."}
{"text":"Small Chinese restaurant offers homemade style dumplings, buns, and other great dishes with big portion sizes and affordable prices. Long wait times are merited for tasty goods - but I wouldn't come here hungry.  What I Liked: lamb dumplings, soupy buns, seaweed salad What I Didn't: anything with cabbage, and the green onion pancake was meh What I'd Get Next: lamb dumplings, soupy buns, seaweed salad to be safe, and probably experiment with one of the chicken dishes next   The name of the restaurant is on the DineSafe pass past the front door, but besides that, there's no sign once you walk past the overhang.  It was packed on a Sunday evening, and apparently it's always packed according to the server. Small restaurant has a small kitchen - so it also takes time to get your food - nearly half an hour. Servers speak in Mandarin but can be prompted in English.  CABBAGE. Just avoid it.  VEGETARIAN POTSTICKERS: little bland, but actually went well with the seaweed sauce.  LAMB DUMPLINGS are real good. Thicker skin than some places keeps the soup inside hotter for longer! Soup itself is less gamey than Dumpling King but it was a chivey/sweet-ish twist to it. They come steamed or boiled. Great value.  SEAWEED SALAD was surprisingly good. Vinegar based dressing/sauce with green onion and garlic gives it good flavour. Also, really good portion size!  SIU LONG BAO (\"soupy buns\"). Damn good.  I'll be back when I'm in the area and not HUNGRY."}
{"text":"Chose this place from an article in a Chinese newspaper. We had the beef pancake to start which is smaller than other restaurants but definitely very tasty. Next came the Xiao Long Bao (steamed dumplings filled with soup). The skin is thicker but I cannot say it lacked any flavour. The broth inside was salty and flavourful to the point where you do not need anything to pair with it. The pot stickers were very surprising. I've never had so much juice in one before! It's very good hot and fresh. The steamed buns were alright, skin was too thick for my personal liking but it seemed like a popular fish amongst other guests. Also had a tomato based noodle. It was very refreshing in flavour and the noodles were just perfect! I would definitely come back just for the Xiao Long Bao and the noodles alone. Prices were very fair but take heed, cash only! Menu is in Chinese and English and the one server that was there seemed to only speak Chinese but could understand English which was pleasant."}
{"text":"Vey authentic Chinese food :). We ordered Shanghai noodle, two plates of dumplings and some beef bun for four of us. All of us got really full at the end too, so portions are pretty decent.   Will definitely come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is a da bomb.  Price is excellent extraordinary.  Quality is awesome.  This place is good & cheap!  Must come!!  Dont miss out!"}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is fast becoming a family favorite. Whenever we need to grab a quick lunch, we think of the fresh buns and dumplings from here and head over immediately. The place is small but efficient, and the tea is strangely fragrant. It's always a toss-up between the  pan-fried buns but the fennel buns for me. The dumplings are well made, even the regular ones have plenty of juice packed inside each one.   The menu has English on it, so it's easy to navigate the choices. All the pictures on yelp and the steaming hot dishes arriving at neighboring tables will help with your choices also. A solid lunch place if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dumplings (the skin texture was perfect). My sister likes the steamed buns and I liked the pan fried buns. The onion pancake was a little too chewy. The xiao long Gao skin is ticker than most places but I really like it. Everything was delicious and will be back for more !"}
{"text":"Perfect! Real Tianjin style! Jianbing guozi! Xiaolongbao! Huixiang dumpling! Next time will taste dalumian and subao..."}
{"text":"Old Neighbour Restaurant has quite a selections of Northern style dishes, aside from dumplings and buns.  All the dumplings you do have a choice of either having them boil or steam... if you prefer steaming like me, it will take a while to arrive.  Prices are reasonable at $4.99 for 15 dumplings... and buns are around the same price.  Lunch Specials till 3 pm but are all rice dishes with free soy milk drink.  The interior is quite clean at least nothing are sticky........"}
{"text":"Most of the restaurants in the same plaza were kind of empty. I was surprised to see this dumpling place was almost full when we got in. It is not a big restaurant but sufficient tables to dine in. The xiao long bao were so good. They are more juicier compare to other places. The steamed dumplings were also great, xiao long bao is my favourite there. We also ordered the chinese onion pan cake, which was surprisingly good and not too oily.   I couldn't taste any MSG; which is rare in Scarborough. The restaurant seemed clean and the food had big portion. I am definitely coming back sometimes."}
{"text":"A must visit! Yes, the wait time is a bit long, but it's made fresh to order! I had a chance to talk to the owner since my family is also from Tianjin, and  he explained how he waits until a customer orders something to make it. The soup dumplings were excellent. The wrappers on all the dumpling were the perfect thickness. Thick enough to not break easily, but not doughy. My brother and I ordered boiled egg, chive, shrimp, pork dumplings, the soup dumplings, and the braised pork, cabbage buns. All delicious!! My brother and I have been to Tianjin many times (him living there until he was 7) so we can definitely vouch for the authenticity. Do not hesitate to come here."}
{"text":"EDIT:  I've been told that this restaurant is apparently open and still running! I haven't gotten to check it out for myself, so take this with a grain of salt. However, if you don't live nearby and are driving out just for the food, please call ahead so you can make sure it's open.   I would love to try the food here and will be updating my review again as soon as I get down to this place!   Old \"Review\": I'm just leaving this review here to deter anyone who wants to visit before Yelp figures out if this place is closed down or not.  Went here a few weeks ago in search of good dumplings, and called ahead to see if they were open. The phone rung and rung but nobody picked up. When we got to the restaurant, it was all dark and looked closed up inside.  Pretty sure this place has closed down since the last review about 7 or 8 months ago."}
{"text":"By far the best dumplings I've had in Canada. I was very impressed... However their other dishs are bland. Come for the buns dumplings and amazing prices!!!  The xiao long bao is a must! Soupy goodness.     And the lamb dumplings best ever! Filled with flavour!!!"}
