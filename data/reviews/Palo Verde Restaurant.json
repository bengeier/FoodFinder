{"text":"Bar tender is nice. Food is priced right and the pool is great. The staff is friendly cost is affordable and the bar tender even took the time to be sure the music was on poolside. We really enjoy attending events here as well."}
{"text":"We went there on prime rib night. Had called ahead for a reservation and was told by \"Art\" that we didn't need one for the time we wanted to come in. 5:30 p.m. There were 2 on our party.  When we arrived the host asked if we had a reservation. We explained that we had called ahead and were told by Art that we didn't need one.The host said no one by that name works there. So they seated us. The bread basket is weird, two small jalape√±o rolls two tiny soft breads sticks and some strange flavorless chips. We ordered the prime rib. My husband wanted his medium rare with mashed potato. I ordered just pink with baked potato.  They got the potatoes switched with him getting the baked which he didn't eat. The prime rib was so-so. We ate about half of the serving and brought the rest home for the dogs. Don't think we'd be in a rush to go back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Excellent service. Everything from burgers to steaks. Great pasta dishes."}
{"text":"This location is just 1 mile from my home so we frequentl this great restaurant offer. They have a nice menu selection for the country club members."}
{"text":"OK food but slow service at Palo Verde.  However, better than other sun lakes communities food. It is recognized for the best quality restaurant throughout Sun Lakes active adult communities. Staff is thin and there is turnover. It seems to be losing its reputation of good food and service. Unfortunate but true."}
{"text":"Three of us went last night for prime rib. It was great and cooked perfectly, we brought half the meat home for lunch today. The staff was great. It is a private club so you must be a resident of Sun Lakes to eat at this location. We wanted to try the prime rib because we had heard positive things about it from friends."}
{"text":"Went there with 9 friends several had been there before and spoke highly of it.  They have a new kitchen staff with a chef that has been there about a month.  Little went right.  Took 1 hour to get dinner salads.  Service was slow.  When food finally arrived 4 dinners were overcooked to the point of being inedible.  2 others came cold. 4 dinner salads didn't arrive with rest of food and came out 1 at a time.  They ended up comping 6 meals."}
