{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday evening. The place was empty except for 3 customers, and yet two different staff members ignored our party of two for a solid 5-10 minutes. Didn't even wave us over to grab a table on our own. We walked out. I used to grab pho frequently at their old business on Gerrard before they moved, which is why I came by to try out this new place. I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Amazing service great food! Cozy atmosphere and reasonable prices! Crispy Egg Noodles with beef were amazing so was the Traditional pad Thai!"}
{"text":"I really liked the interior of the place when I walked in and had high hopes which were sadly crushed when I tasted their Magic Pad Thai, which was far from magical or their Tamarind Chicken which was more gingery than tamarind. After dousing my dishes with hot sauce, I am not a fan of Tabasco, which should say a lot, I still didn't like it and struggled to get to half way of the dish so as not to be rude or offend the hard work they put in. I know Thai dishes are generally on the sweeter side but this was a sugar shock for me. Even Bahn Thai and Thai Express are solid gems compared to this."}
