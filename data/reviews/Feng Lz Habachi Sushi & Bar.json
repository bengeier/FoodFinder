{"text":"The owners are very courteous, the place is clean and I enjoy everything I order. I work at another local restaurant and I can say they do everything right. Sushi is fresh and on point. Although they don't do hibachi at the place you can sit down or take it to go. I suggest anyone who hasn't been there to check it out. Very well done. Kudos."}
{"text":"Elegant, delicious sushi! Feng LZ ROCKS! The fish is fresh and well proportioned to rice. Rice is moist and warm. Presentation is artful. Decor is refined and austere. Service is attentive and pleasant. I hope this restaurant doesn't change a bit, and thrives. It's a real gem. If you know authentic sushi, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to try the lunch menu: Sushi was very good! Lunch was only $12.00 and the hibachi was just okay ... Service was good. Will go back for more sushi and the bar experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious sushi in an upscale atmosphere. Best miso soup I've ever had. They have a buffet that's pricey but delicious and well worth it for a special occasion. You should go there right now."}
{"text":"Got our order wrong on takeout and was some of the worst sushi I've ever eaten.  Rice was terrible. Spicy tuna did not taste fresh.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"We love this place! The sushi is fresh. The staff is really nice! Half off on Tuesday is great! One of new favorite place to go for sushi!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best (not very tasty, hand rolled was coming apart, and they really skimp on the wasabi). On top of that, they wouldn't even honor the 20% coupon that they keep advertising on Yelp. Definitely not worth visiting again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi restaurants I've eaten at . The service was amazing , our waitress was kind and always checking in on our needs. The food was beyond delicious and very affordable!! I would highly recommend everyone to come and eat here . It is also very beautifully decorated inside and super neat!! A wonderful place to go during the weekend.   P.s ALL YOU CAN EAT Monday - Friday 11-4:30pm 18$ ,  this alone worth to go!!! Weekend 20$."}
{"text":"I have never given a 5 star, but in my defense, my experience couldn't be better. Then establishment just underwent renovations and it looks very nice, especially in this area. Tuesdays half off sushi, beats out taco Tuesday easily. They prepare it with fine attention and is some of the better sushi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Sat down immediately to a very nice atmosphere. It is very quiet and dim. Service was pretty good, a little slow  refilling my drink but overall very good.   We had a total of six different sushi rolls. They were all very good. Good size portions at a very good price for lunch.  I would definitely recommend the spicy tuna roll as well as the classic roll   There is a very extensive menu and would definitely go back again to try more things"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Asian food. Everyone has somewhere they recommend and every town usually has at least one place to grab some fried rice or wonton soup, and a medium to good sushi place. Well Feng LZ trumps all for me. They feature quite a spread and it's all amazing. Their fried rice is incredible. Wonton soup rocks. Sushi rolls are delicious. Hibachi Dinners are fantastic. I really haven't found something I don't like. They have all your staples done amazingly and on top of that some less regular dishes if you want something fun or interesting.   If all that isn't enough it's at a great location, the decor is sweet, and the staff is incredible. Wonderful service. I left my phone and they stayed open 40 minutes after closing time to get it back to me.   Really amazing place. Top of my list for anything Asian."}
{"text":"I love coming here for half price sushi on Tuesdays! Sushi rolls are quite small though. I wish it was another day of the week as well. It seems like this is when they are the busiest."}
{"text":"This has become a staple for our family. Whether it's take out or we dine in, we are never disappointed. Staff is always friendly and goes above and beyond. I always recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for good sushi. Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"NO more hibachi show! Instead they blend in with some cheap greasy Americanized chinese food in the Manu and over priced them. Sushi quality worse then the all u can eat chinese buffet down the road. Stay away people do not waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was very good. Especially the salmon. The hibachi chef was very skilled and fun"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with all you can eat  They are all super quality don't expect low quality by unlimited portion it's awesome"}
{"text":"Visited mid-day for all you can eat, which is not really all you can eat because you have to order off a specific menu and you have to finish every grain of rice, and the service was sub-par. Had to wait 5 minutes for someone to come to the front of the restaurant to be seated. Ordered some nigiri, which is sashimi over rice, and it tasted really fishy. I'm the type of person who usually eats sushi with a yum yum or spicy mayo sauce, but even they didn't mask the underlying taste. The eel, specifically, was gross and hard to finish for it to qualify for all you can eat, meaning I had to finish it or the price of the eel nigiri would have been added to the price I already paid for the all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"I have only had the sushi here but it is delicious.  I usually request carry out for Lunch.  Always done fast and ready every time I show up to pick up my order,  The lunch special is soup salad and 2 rolls for $8.95.  Also the wasabi is amazing and has serious kick!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and am happy to say that my experience was great and I will be coming back again. They have amazing presentations of their sushi and make the plates look fancier than the price tag. The sushi is affordable and they have a large selection of rolls. They only had one waiter on my weeknight visit, so as long as you can be patient there won't be much of a problem. I started my meal with the Shumai and my friend ordered the Seaweed Salad. She said it's one of the best salads she has tried in the area. I ordered a sushi roll and she got the tuna tartar. The presentations were beautiful and quite delicious."}
{"text":"I love Feng LZ. We eat here often (at least once every 2 weeks) and I have never been disappointed. The service has always been friendly, attentive and fast and the sushi is excellent. I've tried quite a few rolls, including the sushi boat, and everything has been delicious and I don't say that lightly about sushi - I've often been disappointed elsewhere. My boyfriend loves the nabe yaki udon, which I always have to \"test\" because it's that good. They have drink specials (we usually do the 2 for $8 Moscow mules) and an all you can eat price during lunch times (11am to 4pm).   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for 5/15/14 at 9:15 p.m.  They close at 10:00 on Thursdays, but they had no problem taking my reservation.  My husband and I both graduated from college that night, so it was a celebratory dinner with our families.  Well, Commencement ran late, and we did not get to the restaurant until a little after 9:30.  They were still extremely accommodating and polite, insisting it was no trouble at all we were late.  The cooks were great, highly entertaining and the food was delicious!  The waitresses were very attentive and polite, actually going beyond what we've come to expect from servers at restaurants.  For example, my two young daughters were with us, and when they brought the soup out, they asked if we wanted a cup of ice to cool it down for them.  At the end of the meal, they even brought my husband and me each a \"congrats\" plate of ice cream.  It was so nice!  As said, the food was absolutely great, no complaints at all.  I am so happy we chose this restaurant to celebrate our graduation! This was my second visit to the restaurant; the first was also a pleasant experience.  They do have their liquor license now, and their drinks are great!  I will recommend this restaurant to anyone!  Their service is excellent, as is the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try with two neighbors on a Weds night. Had been here a year ago when under different ownership (Fujiyama?), was just OK  Got their early, around 5, and sat at the sushi bar. Peter, the Sushi chef, immediately offered us a handroll appetizer-  Excellent. Peter has been a sushi chef for 15 years, he and Angela recently moved to Broadview Heights- very nice people. We decided to let Peter, and Angela ( his wife, both from China) tell us what to try.  Amazing dinner-highly recommend doing this if you like real sushi  You'll get nothing but the freshest, and will probably find new favorites. Everything was fresh, great balance of flavors.Had a daily special, a yellow tail with a citrus based sauce- absolutely perfect, beautiful presentation, tasted even better. Can't remember everything we had, but all was top notch. Had several pieces of hamachi, salmon, snapper, and mackerel, all perfect Had an excellent sake as well Finished with a delicious ice cream dish Very happy to find this gem in our neighborhood,  We will all be back soon."}
{"text":"Upon entering this establishment, you feel assured of a great foodie experience.  The beautiful, classy ambiance, decor, design and layout is well hidden within the front door of this strip mall location.  Although busy there is plenty of space for any number of customers.  I sat at the sushi bar and ordered a Hawaiian Poke Bowl and a Bonsai Sushi Roll.   At first I was disappointed in the cost of the bowl for the amount of tuna in it.  After digging into it I realized that it was full of avocado and mango, both expensive fruits.  The taste was well worth it too.  My roll was a fresh, clean wonderful burst of goodness.  Plentiful wasabi and ginger kept me extra happy!!  Absolutely a bookmark for me on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"They didn't accept no coupons and yelp aslo give 20% off any order and it didn't work ,cuz it was exp on 2016"}
{"text":"Ordered take out at the bar. They only had one server/bartender taking care of guests. Service was very slow. Ordered sushi and hibachi amongst other appetizers. Have had way better sushi rolls for the prices they charge on east side sushi places. Don't plan on returning"}
{"text":"A staple for my family and highly underrated in the community. The sushi is great; everything is always big and beautiful and they never skimp on fish. The clear soup is some of my favorite and you can't go wrong in any of the special rolls. My personal favorite is the summer roll. Friend rice is actually amazing too. The best I've had in Ohio.   This decor is beautiful, the staff is friendly, helpful, and nearly always sends us a dessert on the house (we usually have 6 guests). Service can be a little slow, but that's what you should expect for the elaborate sushi presentations that the chef puts out. Always a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Service both front of house and kitchen were painfully slow, an hour and a half for 1 hibachi chicken dinner.  My salad had a hair in it, and when the entree came out, the veggies were piping hot, but everything else was lukewarm at best for some reason.  Little to no flavor in hibachi, but the yum yum sauce made it much more edible.  The reason I'm giving as high of a rating as I am is that the place has decent sushi that is presented beautifully.  It's not knock me down best sushi I've ever had, but definitely decent, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite buffet style of restaurant. It seems my favorite Time of the week is on Sunday's to join this establishment for their buffet style lunch.   It's located in a nice and cozy parking lot off 82.  As you walk into establishment, you walk into the bar and one or the dining rooms that they have, sushi is located in the far right. It seems they also have a karaoke room, haven't had a chance to try that yet, but will one day.    Now, back to the main reason why I am reviewing this place, Food.  They do have a regular menu that you can order al a carte, I tend to go for the buffet style lunch.    Best way to describe this is this way.   They will bring you what you order Off the menu few items at a time, in order for them to bring out more, you must eat the prior ordered food, what ever you don't finish, they will add an extra charge to your bill.   Some of the food items that are a must try here is the Miso Soup, steamed dumplings, eggs rolls with the sweet and sour sauce are delicious.   The sushi menu is extensive and will catch you by surprise, the sushi here is Delicious and for the most part, is better then some of the sushi joints I have visited here in Cleveland area.  Buffer style lunch is $17.99 on the weekdays and $19.99 on the weekends, it's definitely worthy the money."}
{"text":"visited it in jan. 2016 three friends ventured out in the cold seeking something new and what we found was beyond our expectations. we went for the AYCE option and we are definitely going  back every few weeks and bringing more friends . highly recommended ;  Great quality for an amazing deal. looking forward to going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went recently w a coworker and we really enjoyed it. We ordered two rolls and the spicy Kani Salad (per our waiter's recommendation). The salad had a good bite-not the kind of spicy where you can't taste any other flavors. Nothing extraordinary, but good.   Our rolls-the Golden Apple & the Happy Girl-were beautiful and delicious. I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed banana in a sushi roll, but it all went so well together. The tuna on both rolls was fresh and melted in my mouth. That's a win.   I definitely recommend giving it a try. I will head back again."}
{"text":"First was hesitant to try this place because of the outside/location--but do not judge a book by its cover! The food is delicious and the portions are generous (I always end up with leftovers). It is a great place to stop in for lunch/dinner or for carry out. The staff is always accommodating with my difficult orders and constant need for refilled water."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Northeast Ohio.  It's great for special occasions or just casual dining.  They are a family owned business and work very hard to please their customers. Have so much love for this place, it's always on the itinerary when I'm visiting.  Really impressed by all the different rolls and creative presentation.  This is a great place.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious!! Service was amazing. Food was fresh, fast, and presented beautifully!! The interior is very nice, bar area fully stocked and ready to roll! Will return again, and again!!"}
{"text":"I've been house sitting 40 minutes from home, and have been eating cereal as a result of the total lack of food in the house. After 2 days of Captain Crunch and Raisin Bran (don't call my mother) I knew it was time for some healthy take-out.   I called up Feng LZ (I have no idea why it's called Fujiyama on here?) and I ordered the chef's choice sushi lunch special, which included a 6 piece California roll, 5 pieces of chef's choice sushi (all nigiri), a small salad, and a bowl of miso soup. My order was ready when I arrived to pick it up, and it cost me $8-something. A fantastic deal for the amount of food served, which left me quite satisfied!   Sitting down to this Japanese lunch feast, everything more than lived up to my expectations. The salad was crisp and fresh, my bowl of miso soup was still satisfactorily warm even after the 20 minute drive to the house, and all the sushi was excellent! I would absolutely order from them again, and I would love a chance to dine in, the interior was very chic and quite welcoming!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my all time favorite restaurants around Cleveland. Luckily, it just happens to be in my back yard.  If it isn't for you, it's worth the drive.   I've eaten here over a dozen times since it opened in August or September, and the quality of each meal has been superior.  Don't be confused, there was a sushi restaurant in this location prior to this one.   I can't compare as I never ate there.      Feng is a classy looking upscale restaurant, that reminds me of a nice place you would find in Manhattan.   The staff is always pleasant and welcoming.  The sushi is alway fresh and prepared elegantly.  I've include some pictures from our meal last evening (Jan, 2016)    If you are a sushi fan check it out. You won't be disappointed.  If not there are a lot of wonderful non sushi options."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been coming for years, and always very happy. Quiet, local, affordable with great sushi and sashimi and lots of options to keep the kids happy.   Every time I order a sashimi dinner the bring it out in this fancy shell. I told David (who looks a bit like Vin Diesel) that I didn't need them to go to the effort, but he says the sushi guy just love taking care of us. Great place!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience! Always awesome food and great takeout! Hibachi and sushi are great!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi & hibachi love the design of the place, fun & sophisticated and in Broadview Heights! Check it out."}
{"text":"Feng LZ is the place to go for sushi in this area. I love this place! They use fresh fish from west side market, the prices are reasonable, the environment is inviting and modern, and the sushi chef (Peter) will make beautiful masterpieces to adorn your plate! We've had a giraffe made of parsnip and a swan made of an apple on our sushi boats! The service is quick and friendly. If you're in the mood for sushi, definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Surprisingly not busy at lunch time on Friday, which is a shame. This place should be getting a lot more business considering the quality you get for the price. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was ok in the beginning when we arrived. Then it wast terrible the waiter wanted us to eat every little crumb off the plate before he brought us another one. He kept saying \"no waste\". Now if I'm paying for it an I leave a half eaten California roll on the plate I believe I should be able to. We asked for the bill an he attempted to try to make us eat after we were full. I already had it set in my mind no tip! I paid then left, he ran to the door an said \"you leave no tip\" I said no! I give great tips but not for poor service then got in my car an left.   It's not a regular buffet but it's a nice little restaurant. I wouldn't recommend eating in I would just take the food out it's better also your not being harassed about what to eat or a tip."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome sushi and hibachi! I go for lunch with my co-workers and we get bento box or hibachi. I am from the east side and have been to the pricey and highly rated sushi places like sushi rock and nobu tie (however u spell it) and this place is the best! Cali rolls have generous portions of avocado and crab, less rice and filler. Shrimp is always fresh. Clean nice atmosphere and friendly staff. In and out in good time considering its out lunch break. Highly recommend!!!!!! Thanks Feng LZ! Keep up the awesomeness!"}
{"text":"SUPERB fresh sushi and sashimi. We went here at 3pm on a Monday. Not the best time to go searching for good sushi, but I had a craving and Yelp! recommended.  I was not disappointed in the least. The service was the perfect combination of kind, helpful, and efficient. I got the sushi and sashimi combo with an extra special roll, the Beauty and the Beast roll. The presentation put other good sushi restaurants I've been to (I live in DC) to shame. It was a true work of art, but artful presentation won't cover up lousy fish, and this didn't have to. Part of the beauty of the food was how fresh looking it was; the tuna a deep healthy dark red, the salmon orange with nicely developed fat, the white tuna a firm, snowy white. The amount of fish you get is well worth the price, and everything was light and tasty and, again, exceedingly fresh. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The presentation of the sushi is absolutely beautiful. The Godzilla Roll was delicious!    We also tried the drink special - Fuzzy Sunshine-so good.   Great service to go along with all of that too!"}
{"text":"Excellent in every way, the food is amazing best sushi I've tried in Cleveland, the freshness, it's clean, everyone is nice and the buffet it's just the right way to do it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere, very nice and attentive service.  Get the shrimp tempura roll! Just an FYI it's not a true hibachi place, there's no show... Which honestly if you've seen one you've seen them all.. Same food though"}
{"text":"Great food,  amazing service,  really good specials.  The sushi is as good as any place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food and a good amount for the price.  Nice atmosphere.  Looks newly remodeled.  Hibachi isn't at the table which I like.  They make it in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since new owners took over.  I ate here a few weeks ago and the shrimp was cold and the steak extremely chewy.  The waitress never comes back to check to see if everything came out OK.    Tried it again today for lunch.  Server was terrible.  Nobody in the restaurant but it was very difficult to get quick service and when he would finally come over - he was very rushed like he was in a hurry to get to the next table (but there was nobody else in there).    When the food came out - the waiter said very hot and then proceeded to put the plate directly on my arm which was on the table - I didn't realize he was going to set my plate down so quickly and I didn't have time to move out of the way.  Then tried to use a Valpak coupon for buy one get one half off and they didn't want to honor it because it was lunch (even though it says no where on the coupon that it must be used for dinner).  I asked to see the manager - but he would not come out.  They just took 15% off - which wasn't even what the coupon was for.  The waiter told us that he would take that off \"this time only\" - and I informed him that we wouldn't be coming back and he told me \"Whatever.\"  I don't see this place making it unfortunately. With all the hibachi restaurants in the area - you have to be better than the pack to succeed and that just isn't going to happen with this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Best in town. Go for it. The teriyaki chicken is solid as well. Try something, come back and try something else, repeat again and again. Definitely a step above the normal mediocre sushi places dotted in each town in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"So usually we come here and service is good and speed is descent. Today (Mother's Day) we have been here for just over an hour now and our kids got there chicken nuggets. We however got our soup and one out of three apps we ordered. FRIGIN ridiculous! The only reason for two starts is past experiences where descent. Mommy is getting fed up."}
{"text":"Great sushi, friendly staff, and great drinks. Sushi presentation was great! I highly recommend Feng."}
{"text":"We've visited this awesome restaurant 3 times now over the last few months and we LOVE it! The staff is always very friendly, warm and welcoming. They are efficient and make sure your every need is met. They swiftly bring you your drinks and food then clear your plates or provide refills just as swiftly. They are a great family restaurant that treats your children like royalty too. The hibachi chefs make funny, appropriate jokes.   Play \"catch\" with the kids and add more fire if they like it! My child has a shrimp allergy and they have always been extra careful and vigilant about his food preparation. The food at the hibachi grill tables has always been delicious. They never make you wait for a full hibachi table like most places. I love that! The sushi has also always been tasty and super fresh. This is one place our whole family loves and can always can agree on. A GREAT addition to the Broadview Heights area."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Stopped by here in the winter and tried the Chinese and Japanese noodles. Both were underwhelming in taste."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. But never come here for half off night. We were seated right away. Waited 15 min to place drink order. Waited another 15 min to place sushi order (15 rolls). Then waited AN HOUR AND A FORTY FIVE MIN to get our sushi. And they even messed up one of our rolls. They were completely understaffed. One waitress and one sushi roller. Chefs were in the back on their phones. I'll try to call in my order an hour in advance next time. But I doubt they're going to get the order right"}
{"text":"I been looking for a new sushi restaurant since I'm came back from Tokyo. I finally found one is comparable to what I had in Tokyo. Sushi/Nigiri was very good. The taste definitely remind me of Japan. There is an all you can eat deal from 11am to 4pm. The waiter was very nice and provided excellent services.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoy Japanese cuisine. This my new favorite place and I'll be returning in the future whenever I have cravings for sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not many really nice restaurants in Broadview Heights. This is one of the best!  Signed up for the VIP card and I save a little every time I go in. Also they played an awesome Birthday song when we went there for my Birthday!  Food is fresh. My wife loves the sushi.  Highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have EVER had! The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and the drinks were yummy! :)"}
{"text":"I recently went to Feng Lz with a couple friends. They raved of the all you can eat sushi it did not disappoint. I ordered my favorite Sapporo in a bottle   My friends ordered the Tokyo tea a melon cocktail. Beware quite the heavy pour and very citrusy. For my starter I had miso soup. Very flavorful however both my friend and I only had all of about 5 pieces in our bowls. The soup was included in the 30 price along with appetizer and all the sushi. We ordered an array of sushi to share between us all. Not one roll on our plates were bad all delish.  This special ends at 430  pm on Monday's  the waitress allowed us to order around 420 pm very kind of her. My only service request was waters were not refilled at the table nor was I asked did I want another drink which is why I am leaving 4 stars not 5."}
{"text":"Ohhh, this place. I was searching Yelp for a place that serves sushi and hibachi, praying that they didn't specialize with one more than the other. Prayers were answered.  The presentation of the sushi is unique and fun, very pretty. Totally a date spot. The servers are all different and great in their own ways. I typically order the sushi and my boyfriend, hibachi. The Love Boat for Two, though, is just perfect for us. I love the deserts as well."}
{"text":"First time diner here.  Place was fantastic.  Sushi was very fresh, Hibachi delicious, and the overall décor was beautiful.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted something semi-healthy and filling before a concert, and found this.  All you can eat sushi? Sign me up!  It's actually a quiet, fancy place, hidden in a strip mall.  I wasn't sure if there would be some big buffet.  Nope, you order off a special menu, with plenty of interesting options.  Prices are listed, so you know what kind of value you are getting (and so that they can charge you if you waste food...)  I started small with a kani (crab) salad and negimaki (steak and onion roll.)  The salad was excellent, with big strips of, well, probably fake crab, plus cucumber, and a little heat.  The negimaki was a large portion, with green onion in the middle of slightly-tough teriyaki steak.   Next I had the French Dragon roll: tempura shrimp, eel, avocado.  Oh my goodness, it was good.  Looked amazing, tasted great.  Still a little hungry, I had the Crazy Rabbit.  Crab, avocado, and I forget what else, deep-fried.  Again, perfectly-made.  Large, but held together pretty well.  Tasted great, an interesting balance of flavors.  I didn't get anything raw; there wasn't much of that on the AYCE menu.  Plenty to choose from, and all of it good.   Service was great- fast, friendly, unobtrusive.  She checked at each order to make sure I understood what was in each item.  Worried about food allergies?  Prices are good- I had $40 worth of food for $20.  Take your time, choose wisely, don't overorder.  Sit back and enjoy some great sushi at a good price."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! Best sushi I have had in cleveland Akron area . Good prices . Gorgeous presentations (really that's the reason to come here ! )Wait staff attentive and kind . Beautiful decor . A MUST Try !!"}
{"text":"Ordered all you can eat sushi around lunch time, the rice are three times bigger than the meat and we find hairs three times. I am not sure the food is not that good because of the all you can eat menu. But won't come again. We came because of the review on Yelp but it is definitely over rated. If you would like to give a try, try the their normal menu, and let me know how is it. Good luck!"}
{"text":"So, because this place changed hands not so long ago I\"m giving them 5 stars to try and even up some of the bad reviews of the previous owners.  Doesn't seem fair the new place (and trust me, the food's real new) should suffer from the sins of the 'old' place. Would have given them 4.5 if it existed simply on it's own merits.  This was our second visit in a 3 days and we had sushi both times. Frankly, the fact there is now a legit sushi stop on this side of the Cuyahoga may be one of the Seven Signs. I'll get back to you on that one.   Service is very friendly and earnest but don't expect what you would from Dante or Lola, etc. Along those lines I would keep the drink orders simple. But if you're not near GInko or Shuhei and craving excellent sushi (and for VERY reasonable prices), do yourself a major favor and visit Feng LZ. You may be as pleasantly surprised as we were."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.The palm leave that came as a decoration had a noodle attached to the underside of it and I did not order any noodles which leads me to believe that it came from a dirty dish.I walked to the sushi bar to complain because the server was nowhere to be found and could clearly see the staff smoking in the back of the place and the kitchen was beyond filthy.I walked out of the place and the guy was trying to argue with me for paying for a recycled meal."}
{"text":"So on a repeat visit, again having the \"all you can eat\" lunch for $20, this experience was only OK.  We noticed if you order miso soup or salad that is typical of japanese restaurants that they gave me a huge bowl of miso and a very large plate of salad.  I would be wary of ordering these next time because what's the point of \"all you can eat\" if they try to stuff you on sides.  I would guess that the miso soup was twice as big as normal and the salad was 3x as large.  I ate it because you are not supposed to waste at a buffet and they will actually charge you.  Aside from that most of the sushi fare we had was very good.  some rolls were unexpectedly laden with sauces which under the same name did not have sauce at other Japanese restaurants, ie. shrimp tempura roll.  If you stick to regular maki rolls, all is good.  More than good even--Some of the best I've ever had and I've had a lot!  I guess it's more finding what you like on their extensive menu.  Next will try a sashimi lunch and see how that is."}
{"text":"Lived 7yrs in Japan this made me feel like I was back. The best sushi and food I have had in long time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for great Japanese food."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the Brecksville Broadview Hts area. The staff was efficient  and the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Very good hibachi and sushi at a very good price! Very nice and modern when you walk in. The food is made very well and taste outstanding. Very good service too"}
{"text":"Awful service.  Had to ask for silverware and chopsticks.  Waiter brought out wrong soup, didn't apologize and acted like I ordered the one he brought out.  Never brought out soy sauce after we asked for it, had to get it from another table myself.  Took 20 minutes to get our check.  Overall was there for almost two hours when we should've been in and out in less than an hour.  Average food."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely wonderful find. I ended up in Broadview Heights for an event and decided to try something new for dinner. The atmosphere was cozy but nice and familiar, the service was excellent and the food even better. I had a hard time deciding between the hibachi and the sushi, but ended up getting shrimp hibachi to rival all other hibachi dinners I've had. My friend got sushi that was beautifully plated and also highly rated. We're already finding excuses to try it again even though we each live far from the area."}
{"text":"My family has gone here at least a dozen times. We have had a few experiences where the service from the wait staff was average at best, but we keep going back because the chefs are always entertaining and the food is extremely consistent. One of my kids is a sushi eater, and the quality of the samples I steal from her plate is quickly converting me."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is really all you can eat rice with a razor thin slice of fish on top. Very slow service bit it's not the servers fault.  There was only 1 server and the restaurant at lunchtime was full.  He even chased down the food to try and keep things rolling."}
{"text":"First time experience at Fujiyama! Sat on the hibachi side of the restaurant with a party of four. The people here are extremely accommodating and friendly! We all ordered hibachi and some sushi rolls which were both fantastic! We went for dinner on a Friday, but I noticed how they have great happy hour deals and lunch specials! Definitely coming back here soon"}
{"text":"I never thought that upon moving to Ohio I would find so many great sushi places. It's not like an obvious connection to make, right?! Feng LZ is definitely up there as some of the best with awesome what I like to call the S Trifecta- great sushi, specials, and service.   Their sushi is bomb, they text me coupons and stuff (we're buds), and they dish some tasty hibachi as well. They always give me light up contraptions with my sushi plate and I feel like I'm a damn rich person on the Hunger Games! Prices are reasonable and I need to get in there to try the AYCE sushi, even though this is something I typically shy away from. Love you, Feng's - keep killin' it!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi !!!!!! Will come again! Service was great! Staff very nice! Hard to see there is a restaurant from the street!"}
{"text":"Excellent servers and excellent sushi! Never have done me wrong! Absolutely love their spicy kani roll! The prices are average but can get slightly pricey, however is always worth it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed by far the BEST sushi in Notthern OHio. Sweet Heart Rill a wonderful dish. AK 47 excellent. Monster Roll excellent. Quality texture taste all amazing. Environment modern excellent. Service simply perfect."}
