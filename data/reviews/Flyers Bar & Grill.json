{"text":"Whoa there are redeeming elements to dive bars. None at this place cheap intoxicants are great but I can buy them at a store...as you should of the only option is this place."}
{"text":"On that stretch of road, probably the best value of the bunch.  My go-to place when it's beer o'clock.  I feel that I should elaborate and point out that yes, this place is a dive; but it's everything a great dive should be: big cheap beers, great cheap food, and good service.  I've never walked out of Flyers with buyers remorse.  I can't say the same for their upscale competition on the other side of York road."}
{"text":"So the place is called \"Flyers\". I'm convinced that best represents the annual air show and the potential for a stray missile to crash down in Parma Hts and level the location at Latitude - Longitude:
41.389919,-81.763749.

Okay, clearly that's a tad facetious but...the place needs a facelift like Mike Tyson needs facial tattoo removal. \"If you don't know, now you know!\"  Yes, they were a Bar Rescue final consideration. Boy, did that show blow it!!

The bathrooms sometimes work with full efficiency and sometimes you get a decent bartender. The service is hit or miss because the staff continuity is hit or miss. That is largely because the turnover. The food is not horrible but see above about turnover. Sometimes the food is solid, sometimes it's not and you have to wait quite a bit. 

Drink prices are reasonable but again, speed of delivery is variable. The owner is frequently present and he will jump in to expedite service. He also treats his regulars very well. He is loyal to regular and semi-regular patrons. 

But, it's not all bad here. The bar does have some quality points. The people make the place. Put differently, it's not Cheers but the patrons show up to see each other. It's a regular gathering place for (VF) Patriot and (HN) Green Wave Alumni. Despite that rivalry, all are fiends here. On the sparse visitations to this bar it is always cool to see friendly faces. 

In conclusion, Bar Rescue \"jumped the shark\" a long time ago but both Flyers and that show could have greatly benefited from an agreement for change. (I.e fixed seats being so \"1950\"). In the meantime it's serves a purpose as a local dive bar. (Volleyball sand court is a plus along with occasional but more rare band appearances)"}
{"text":"Probably the best bar on this stretch of Pearl Rd. Friendly staff, reasonably priced drinks, and a large patio that is smoker friendly. They also have a sand volleyball court for summer leagues. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This bar used to have a fun volleyball leagues...\"bar leagues\".  Now the idiot running the leagues thinks he is refereeing the Olympics... don't waste your time or money unless you have 3 gold medals."}
{"text":"It's a convienent neighborhood place for me ...great building architecturally but honestly have not had a good experience there for years! This past visit the people next to us were given the menu and served prior to us even getting our order taken but thats not all and THEN after they brought the food to the person in my party did they tell me they were out of mozzerella sticks!  (thats the only thing ordered) NICE...rather then having my wings i then ordered \"on the house\" I would rather you just showed a little better service. They have many regulars and I could blame it on that but it is a repeated problem with cold food waiting forever for drinks when they aren't busy and staff on cellphones. Do yourself a favor and keep driving down Pearl ROAD (EITHER DIRECTION) to ANYWHERE but here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dead FLIES in my drink. I ordered a shot of Jager and as I began to sip back the shot, somethings slid across my tongue and I immediately held my shot up to the light and saw not one, not two, but what looked like 30 dead flies in my drink. I immediately got sick, yacked, and all the girl could say was that she was sorry and if she could get me a replacement shot. No manager came out to apologize or make any kind of accommodation. My tab was not comped. That was what was even more disappointing. This place obviously does not cover the alcohol at night and should probably be inspected ASAP."}
{"text":"holy dive into a pool. It is truly a dive, but not completely lost. i think with new management and a revamp of the place it can be worth saving. That being said they have awesome beer and wing specials, i watched a few playoff games here and it was worth the quick drive. the beer was freezing cold, pretty sure my lips got frostbite, but that how beer should be !! their teriyaki wings were pretty good, but they charge you extra for celery which to me is blasphemous. the staff was eh, which solidified the 3 star rating. Its great for locals, and great for a quick meal or a game day."}
{"text":"At 11:05 I was eager to try flyers for taco tuesday and some wings. I had called the bar to see when the kitchen closed and I was told around midnight. I work service industry so I love to see places open later for food. When I arrived at 11pm the doors were locked. I find it ridiculous that a bar closes by 11pm. I am in the market for some new local hangouts and I thought flyers would be great since I only live .25 miles away. I guess I'll never know considering their closing time is not actually what they post. I am severely disappointed"}
{"text":"I went back twice this spring/summer to fill in for my sister's volleyball team. Like rest of Parma, nothing changed here from my last review, besides they now have Dortmunder in a bottle."}
{"text":"A decent bar with really good food specials.   The wings are some of they best I've had.   If you really want a challenge,  try 6 of the 1822 wings.   Taco Tuesday is OK but the Monday and Thursday wing nights are the best."}
{"text":"$2 Miller Lites and .40 cent wings. Can't go wrong with this place. The teriyaki wings are the way to go. The bartender was super nice as well."}
