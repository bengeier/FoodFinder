{"text":"I have only had great experiences getting food from Oak Park Deli. My favourites are their pizza and the souvlaki. Family owned and run - hard working, friendly and take pride in what they make. Oh, try the cheese bread - delicious."}
{"text":"Service and food at this place is amazing. My favourite things to get are the burger and poutine!"}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches, lots of different desserts, reasonable prices, and a real throwback old-school deli experience.  Not the fastest service in the world, but they're really nice folks and the atmosphere is friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches of a quality rarely matched.  When was the last time you had fresh steaming hot bread that needed to cool before they made your sandwich? They may not have a large selection, but what they do they do well."}
{"text":"OPD is the bomb! Great food, great prices, great people! Just do it! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I heart the Oak Park Deli! We always get big poutines and sandwiches, grilled cheese for my son and various ones us, all quite good especially their homemade cheese bread. They are such a nice family, and it's great to have a quality local spot to support."}
{"text":"Fantastic deli, the food is good and was made right in front of me. It's a family owned business so you know they put their all into their food and service. Will definitely be back for their turkey bacon sandwich, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"OPD has made me a believer again.  I didn't think I would ever experience the feelings of euphoria that used to accompany a visit to my all-time fav deli, Direnzio's in Ottawa's Little Italy, but these feelings are back, and they are stronger than ever thanks to the folks here.

I recently moved to the neighbourhood and was feeling a tad lost, for I had left the food friendly confines of the Annex and now had to explore parts unknown.  I woke  with cold sweats fearing that I wouldn't be able to find quality souvalaki, late night pizza or a decent sandwhich-but these fears would never come to fruition thanks to OPD.  I am truly amazed that such a small space can churn out such a variety of comfort food.

I am stupefied how such a modest space can function as a deli, bakery and catering service, but OPD has not only survived doing such but has thrived!!

BEST DEAL: Family Burger Deal for $19.95 ( 4 burgers, 4 Sm. fries and 4 soft drinks)

From Tiropitakia to Lasagna with Garlic Bread & Caesar Salad, OPD has you well covered."}
{"text":"I am sure the only reason why this place is still open is the fact that there is a high school across the street and that it is the only food place in the area.

The owners and employees are nice, but super super slow. Food is ok if you are starving, but nothing you would like to eat to treat yourself.

What stopped me from coming again was the fact that the cook took the cash from me and without using gloves or washing his hands went to prepare my burger."}
{"text":"The portion is hugh!!! The lasagna dinner easily feeds 2 (3 to 4 if you're a sensible eater... Not us). The chicken souvlaki was juicy and came with potatoes and rice. Both came with side salads and cheesy bread. It is not fine dining but great for quick take out in the neigh. The lady was really nice and gave us a couple spanakopaitas for free. How sweet!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and greek salad.  I love the garlicky pizza sauce. They have Great prices too. Its Nice little family owned business.  They offer catering and some family meal deals. They've recently added a side patio."}
{"text":"What a great little place!  we've been going after my weekend swims lately when I'm kind of starving and don't want to wait too long to get a hit of something delicious.   Toula and her family/team have never let us down.  Terrific fresh burgers - if you get all the toppings, it's like having a burger and a small salad.   The greek fries (with feta and tzatziki) are scrumptious.   The desserts and breads (esp their special fresh cheesy bread/buns) are completely on point.   The coffee is classic Greek jet fuel  - my partner has suggested walking to Ajax after a cup.  Well, yeah, it is strong but it's also really tasty coffee - which is rare in my experience. 

They're celebrating the 9th anniversary of Toula taking over from her parents so some awesome deals are on the menu - 16\" pepperoni pizza $9,   2 burgers + large fries $9, 2 large poutine $9 ...etc.  Good deals.  Good food.  Good people.

Today, I'd asked my partner to meet me there - get himself a coffee and a burger - order fries and gravy for me.   The food was up super-fast and he'd finished the burger before I got there - and made a considerable dent in the fries.   They'd forgotten the gravy ... boo hoo.   He went back in, asked to have another order made up with gravy - he'd pay for the original order with no gravy.  They asked if he wanted a refund instead.  He checked with me - I wanted those fries and gravy - a kilometre in the pool makes an old gal hungry!  they made up the fries and gravy and then refused payment.    While he was in the shop, a young guy on a skate board dropped in - he and a friend had picked up food last night - realized later they hadn't paid for the burgers - he was there to pay.   It's a great neighbourhood place - perhaps most efficient when Toula's in the house, but always good food and super-friendly service.

I learned about the place from people on the Mortimer 62 who go there for breakfast almost every weekend.   Apparently the breakfast special is THE deal - bacon/egg/cheddar on a cheese bun, hash browns and coffee/tea - $20 for 4.  We need to check that out - and the lasagne which I've watched Toula prepare for takeout - it looks and smells freaking awesome.

what would make this 5***** ?   a couple of small tables to sit at inside - or at least leave the patio chairs out til there's serious snow on the ground."}
