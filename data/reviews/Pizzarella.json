{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza place I have the misfortune to order from.  I ordered 2 extra large pizzas, bread sticks, and 2 salads plus a 2 liter Pepsi.  There was so much hair in the salads that my daughter and I could not eat it.  I called to complain and was told they could not credit the $17.00+ dollars back because we throw it out. How in the world this place stays in business is beyond me.  Now I am wondering what was in the pizza under the cheese and toppings.  I have not stopped throwing up.  Bboley"}
{"text":"This place has been on Brookline Boulevard for a few years now, and I would have to say that wouldn't survive the Brookline Pizza Wars that's for sure. The food is average to bad, with their gyros getting the Golden Turkey. A few strips of processed meat with some sour cream loaded up with lettuce and onions with some stale pita bread containing it all does not for a good gyro make. Never order a gyro from a pizza place. That is what you almost invariably get.   Their menu sure looks nice though."}
