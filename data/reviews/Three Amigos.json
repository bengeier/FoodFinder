{"text":"There is not much competition for Mexican food in this neck of the woods and with that being said it still satisfies the occasional urge for Mexican food.  Now you wont feel like you are eating in Mexico City but for the price you can can get yourself an adequate Mexican experience.   Once every few months my coworkers and I hit the happy hour after work.   We enjoy their dollar specials on food as well as their free chips and salsa while we socialize and decompress.  Its not the best but will do for now."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a new quasi authentic mexican joint located close to my hometown, however I miss the days when this was an Eat n Park and open late.  This place opened up a few months ago on Freeport Rd., next to the harmarville \"fun\" center (bowling alley, laser tag, etc.).  Im glad it's here instead of the eye sore that was the closed down Eat n Park'.  I've been here twice most recently this past Friday for lunch.  I've only been here when it's empty, so it seems either I eat lunch too late, they do most biz' at night or I will be referring to this as the place that used to be 3 amigos. I believe it has one sister restaurant.  The space itself is set up very much like the Eat n Park used to be except for the addition of a bar close to the front entrance on the right as you walk in.  The bar is pretty big with about a dozen chairs and a few hi-tops.  There are also a couple plasmas, but overall this is not a place I would go to for cocktails or to hang out.  The service of the bartender has been very friendly and prompt both times.  The chips and salsa are free when you order the food and the chips have always still been hot right out of the fryer.  They could use a few more salsa options as I found the flavor of what I tried to be dull.  They have really good lunch specials with a \"pick one, pick two, and a pick three\" for 5.95 to 7.95.  The \"picks\" are the usual assortment of mexican fare (tacos, burritos, chalupas, etc.).  I've only tried the burritos and tacos and found them to be above average, especially for the price.  The tacos and burritos are piled high with cheese and meat (chicken, steak, ground meat, etc) and come with a large portion of fried beans (bland) and rice (dry).  Overall this is a good place to grab a good inexpensive lunch with a beer or two."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Having never been to Mexico, I can't say for sure if this is \"authentic\" or not, but based on other places that friends have told me are \"authentic\", Three Amigos ranks right up there."}
{"text":"Closed.  I'm not really upset it closed.  We always went for the lunch buffet.  I would rather have a mexican restaurant with good lunch specials.  Hoping maybe Ray Azteca would go in."}
