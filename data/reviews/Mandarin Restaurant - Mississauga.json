{"text":"I am sorry to see that  there are so many mixed reviews, but my family totally,enjoyed the all you can eat restaurant.  On a trip tp Toronto to visit for caribana our in laws recommended, this particular Mandarin, Now we eat out quite often including buffets and this one tops the list.  The selection and range of dishes were fantastic, and we could not overlook the service. Next year we are going back. Totally satisfied customers!!!!!!!!   SM New York"}
{"text":"I am more picky on food and have been different decent buffets.   I think food of mandarin was average.  I paid $ 40 per adult including tips and taxes.  it was expensive.  Very few Asian would go to mandarin."}
{"text":"Amazing drink menu, good food, good ambiance and even better service! This is one of my favourite places to eat. If I wasn't worried about my waistline I'd go there a lot more often."}
{"text":"Good food. Good variety of food pricy but taste better than other cheaper buffets. A must go at least once to try if you like buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Megan K. My grandma lives in the area so we took her there for lunch recently. Our party ranged from 5 - 90 [7 people in total] and everyone was happy with the food, even my whiny 5 yr old cousin. Love the food! I am trying to hit up every location this year, and would definitely would go there again."}
{"text":"I like coming here for weekday lunch. What really draws me here is the staff and service, unlike most Chinese places I've gone to, their staff really KNOWS how to tend to their customers--friendly, attentive, speaks (clear) English, properly attired.  Food is alright, like 7/10ish (or 7.5) lol and they have nice selections for desserts and alcohol beverages unlike some other Asian restaurants. If I'm feeling for an all-you-can-eat Asian buffet, Mandarin is usually the destination spot for me."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Mandarin Buffet Restaurant great food, and a good place for birthday parties."}
{"text":"Its all about quantity here, the quality is good but nothing exceptional. It's like All you can eat. I like their Hot n Sour soup and thats it. Everything else is average in taste."}
{"text":"Honestly, this particular Mandarin is not the best out there. It was ok, but over the years the food quality kept getting worse. The chefs were not careful and looks like they didn't use hairnets, as i have found hair in my food on multiple occasions. I even got food poisoning from this place. Not a good experience, i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great experience. It's like a food village."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a Chinese restaurant.  It is a buffet restaurant that also has a Chinese session.  There are sushi, roast beef cut station, dessert bar, ice cream bar, and soup bar.  For a buffet restaurant, it is pretty good.  Foods are kept fresh and generally well-prepared.  Of course they are all heavy on sauce and many deep fried.  What would you expect from a glorified Panda Express?  The surprise was the roast beef.  Well made, tender, and tasty.  The beer selection was disappointing for a northern city.  I ended with Tiger beer."}
{"text":"Mandarin is a traditional Chinese buffet. I don't normally go there cuz like other Chinese fast food restaurants they serve Americanized Chinese food. The dishes were standard Chinese fast food, but overall they were not to bad. the servants were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I was simply very dissatisfied with the food quality. Rather have less options and feel happy with those."}
{"text":"What can I say its perfect for lunch on regular week days as you pay around $15 for buffet so its worth it.   There is a salad bar, 2 isle of various rice, noodles and multiple deep fried stuff. They also have grilled bar and a sushi bar as well. The sushi is the best but its there for the show. and then there is fruit, dessert and ice area.  So there is a lot to choose from and keep on eating."}
{"text":"If I could rate a BIG  zero I would!  Worst place one could ever think of going.  The manager Otto Chan is the biggest douche bag!  The manager literally got into a fight with us and started yelling!  Wonder how this place is still in business with such management"}
{"text":"The food at this Mandarin Buffet doesn't seem quite as good and as varied as the food served at the Mandarin Buffet located downtown Toronto - which is weird since we visited this location on a weekend whereas we visited the other location on a weekday.  However, one of the notable differences was there were crab legs and a stuffer lobster type dish.  My asian family and friends loaded up on these two dishes.  Or, maybe I was just so overwhelmed and overstimulated by my first visit to Mandarin that my perception is a little skewed.  Who knows?!    Waitress was super cute and friendly and offered to take a picture of the group  - love that :)  All in all, I am a fan of buffets and would not turn down a visit to this location - in terms of buffets, it gets the job done!"}
{"text":"I have been less than impressed at this specific location several times, and will now begin avoiding it and attending other mandarin locations. The food was so so, as was the service. Given that it was fathers day, the hussle could be expected, but they should plan for that. I suspect they add msg to the food as I always feel bloated here after 2-3 plates versus my usual 5 or 6 at other buffets. I find the all you can eat sushi places to be a better value for the same money. Overall, not bad. I give it a 3/5, and am being generous."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is there is something for everyone. No matter what your taste is, you won't leave hungry. For the holiday weekend they were serving lamb and turkey on top of their already awesome choices.  It's a great place for large groups"}
{"text":"Very friendly and comfortable Mandarin location.  We arrived just in time for the fresh evening servings and were very happy with the celebrate Canada 150 themed food choices.  We attend Mandarin once in a while for my partners love of crab legs!  This time, I even found choices to enjoy.  Mmmm maple flavored food!  :)"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is crap. I know, that's harsh, but seriously, it is. I think I'm more upset that the price is ridiculous for what you pay for. Here, they believe quanity versus quality.   So, if you want to get full and eat a whole lot of (crappy) food, then by all means, come here. Other than that, don't waste your time. Head over to Chinatown and get some quality food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"What do you expect?  Chinese buffet offers you everything you like to eat and more.  I am not a buffet person but when I want buffet, I go here because it's a sure bet  Lots of variety, set price, spacious dining area, generally pleasant staff"}
{"text":"I haven't visited a Mandarin buffet for quite some time and I was so pleasantly surprised!!! Now, it was a special menu for the Chinese New Year, so I'm not sure how good they really are on a normal weekend lunch, but today, when I went, the selection was great.  The salads tasted amazing.  I particularly loved the broccoli cranberry salad.  It was a delight!  Each salad  had it's own distinct flavour, which I love,  I loved the grilled fish and chicken, they had salmon sashimi and tilapia sashimi (I didn't try the tilapia sashimi), barbecue salmon and a very nicely spiced and hot curry asian chicken.  The chicken wings tasted all right.  Overall, I really liked the place.  When you leave, they offer you a pink mint and a red envelope with a mandarin coin with a whole in the middle.  BIG PLUS: They have a frozen yogurt machine serving vanilla and strawberry AND a cotton candy machine!!!"}
{"text":"I have never seen a buffet so large...and we were visiting from the states, where most of us like to eat and are a bit chubby.  There were sooo many options...Curry chicken, white rice, veggie fried rice, pepper steak, king crab legs, sushi (teriyaki chicken, sweet potato, avocado...), chocolate covered strawberries, 4 kinds of soup, prime rib, won tons, seafood...The list is endless.  It's a bit pricy, about $25 for dinner for a person, but if you have a large appetite, you won't leave hungry.  The waitress was awesome, our drinks were always full.  Great place!"}
{"text":"How do people eat this buffet and hey it's not cheap either?!? Went here due to work related lunch and boy what bad food-it's got no flavor only quantity!!Or I guess I have had better!!FLAVORLESS FOOD!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, always there to fill drinks and clear the dead plates.  Food was good.  Lots to choose from with new items to try for the first time.  Don't kiss the desserts, not your typical.  Will definitely be back again when I am in town.  Great job staff!"}
{"text":"It's our first time in Ontario to visit my relatives and they took me and my family to Mandarin Restaurant for my birthday. I love their buffet! The food selection was great! They have crab legs during dinner time, they have different Chinese dishes, the salad bar was also good and it has a huge and delectable dessert section. If it's your birthday, I recommend signing up online so they can send you a birthday coupon so you can eat for free! I did that and the manager checked my coupon when we got there, when we were having our desserts, they came in and had a cupcake for me and sang happy birthday. My favorite part was that they took a photo of us and turned it into a souvenir photo magnet. I loved that gesture! We will definitely come back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Large selection but sticker shock on Sunday @$29.00 a person. Food was so-so but most very spicy. Big complaint I had were the tons of servers there are trained to nickle and dime you to death to purchase alcohol, coffee and tea throughout the meal. No beverage is included for the $29. Otherwise, the restaurant is very clean and well-run."}
{"text":"We went to this location for my mother in law's 60th birthday. I love Mandarin, the food is always great, the service is always usually pretty good and I always feel like a pig after eating there.  This was my first time in probably 15 years coming to this location. The decor is kinda funky,  and this location is much smaller than the one I usually go to. (etobicoke)  The food was pretty good, lot's of choices at this location. We went on a Saturday Evening around 5pm, so I understand it was busy but what I didn't appreciate was the fact that people kept bumping into me, STAFF INCLUDED. I couldn't believe it, it's not as if I was walking zig zag either.  And we had a waiter hovering around our table.. constantly. I don't mind them picking up our plates when we are done, but to pretty much stand at the end of our table.... during the entire meal? Buzz off, we'd like some privacy.. jeeze.  Anyway, good food, mediocre visit. Will probably stick with my home location."}
{"text":"My friend from Toronto that now lives in Victoria recommended this place to me in an email about a month ago. I was driving down Hurontario and saw it and thought about his email and figured I would stop in.   I walked in and did not know that it was a buffet style restaurant. The woman that took my order let me know that I could still order something from the menu since lunch buffet was over and dinner buffet didn't start for a few hours so I did.  I ordered the vegetarian combo meal which came with 2 spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, and Chow mein noodles with mixed vegetables. All I have to say was that this was the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  The rice had no flavor and was extremely dry with dried up cauliflower and carrots, the noodles were seriously just ramen swimming in chicken broth. I don't eat meat and chicken broth was not something that I was looking forward to tasting.   I got the food to go and didn't realize this bad food till I got back to the hotel. I was not about to drive all the way back to the restaurant. So I tried to eat the rice and the spring rolls and threw the rest of it in the trash.   Yes, I felt bad about wasting food, however I couldn't bring myself to sit there and actually eat it either."}
{"text":"I've been living in Toronto for about 3.5 years now and just this last Friday I made my first visit to a Mandarin restaurant. This place is straight-up dirty feed at it's best. No person ever needs to eat at a buffet but sometimes you just have to dive head-first into gluttony.   I wouldn't say Mandarin is different than any other Chinese buffet you've been to in the past other than that they might have a slightly larger selection and the presentation is a little nicer in some cases. Now, everyone likes good service at a restaurant, but these guys go a little too far. When the server is refilling your water glass practically after each sip, you know it's time to back-off. It's pretty annoying to have someone constantly reaching across the table to top up your glass. Besides, I'm not here to fill up on water, I'm here to stuff my face full of dumplings!  Mandarin is fine, but don't expect anything amazing."}
{"text":"Best location ever and the service is amazing and great and fresh food and ok prices and it's great for gathering and you need to go for dinner because of the crab legs!!"}
{"text":"Typically, mandarin is not my first choice for a buffet meal. But man oh man, their food is delicious. From the spicy beef, fried rice, chicken, grilled items and desserts. It's great  that I can just eat and pick from all the choices they have.  In terms of location, it's a great area near offices and such. The interior is more modern than the out of date exterior look. Very clean and staff that emphasizes on refilling your water after every sips.  I'm not gonna lie, I think the price is a little high. I think that it can be cheaper considering that the food is not the healthiest choice. But overall experience was great and would definitely recommend this for big groups.  The must try food are the mussels and spicy beef. It was seasoned wonderfully and may comeback just for that alone. Thank you mandarin for making out group experience an excellent one."}
{"text":"I went here after reading many reviews.  Overall I did not live this place.  Maybe it's because I am from American and our Chinese is different?  I started with carved prime rib.  It was very chewy, I didn't like that at all.  The sushi selection was very small and wasn't tasty.  I did enjoy the raw Salmon next to the sushi.  As for the Chinese dishes nothing stood out for me.  They have a very large dessert section but the frozen yogurt was just gross.   I also had a brownie that was just ok.  Overall I did not like this place."}
{"text":"This place is in essence a Vegas buffet. But in a good way. Most everything I tried, and I tried most everything, was pretty good. Lots of asian type stuff plus roast beef, chicken, tons of salads and desserts. Good place to go have a sow fest when you are really hungry."}
{"text":"Mandarin Buffet was a major part of my childhood...many a gathering with family and friends were held here (and at various other Mandarin locations).   Now that I'm older, I realize that buffets are not the most high quality selection in the world but this place still holds a special place in my heart.  The selection is unparalleled.  As a child, I held this as the standard to all other buffets and was very dissapointed to find out they did not have a full selection of dim sum, snow crab, carved roast beef, sushi and 20+ flavors of ice cream.  To this day, I have not found another place like this. I love visiting whenever I'm back in Toronto.  It's a piece of my hometown and childhood!"}
{"text":"3.5*  My review will be skewed 'cause I DIDN'T pay!  :)  I was with a bunch of colleagues for a \"Lunch & Learn\".  And we were in a separate room with at least 1 waiter available, so again, my experience was probably a bit better than if I had just gone on my own and paid.  Fanciest stuff for lunch were shrimp cocktail/mussels.  I didn't eat the mussels, but the shrimp were HUGE!  As you all know, you can eat as much OR as little as you want.  If you're paying your own way, you're probably gonna eat as much as possible.  (I didn't eat that much 'cause I was seated right in front of the guest speaker, so I couldn't exactly sneak out to grab food.  Mental note for next time!)  Same goes for eating as \"healthy\" or as unhealthy at the Mandarin.  There are a lot of salad and lighter, non-carby options, so you don't need to stuff yourself to the brim with all chicken balls, lemon chicken, chicken fingers, fries, pizza, etc.!  Out of all the items that I selected, the only thing I really didn't like was the pasta with bacon pieces.  Tasted like they added Cream of Mushroom soup to a red sauce.  Not to my taste, but perhaps others will like it.  Not an awful experience, but again I was there for a work function."}
{"text":"A group of 8 us went there for my brother-in-law's birthday. I've frequented an Asian buffet in Scarborough (I think it's Buffet King) and I thought the Mandarin would have been more 'Canadianized' than I thought. My one and only reason for going to any of these buffets are for the crab legs. (my family with exception of my boyfriend and bro in law are Chinese) Let's be real - these places have to cater to 'lo fan' tastes (that's white people :) ) I thought this place was very good! It does not have many 'authentic' Chinese dishes, but I already knew that before I went. The crab legs were AWESOME. (the pre-cracked thing is amazing for a seafood pig like me!) They don't make any profit from someone like me who has 3 plates of crab legs and a bit of veg - no starches - leaving as much room as possible for the crab :) The place was nice and clean, service was very friendly (unlike 'authentic' Chinese restos... lol - my Asian sis's and bro's know what I mean) honestly, other dishes were ok/good, but that's the way at ANY buffet. (the little steak at the flat top station was pretty damn good) My lo-fan boyfriend's only disappointment was lack of ss pork. I am not a dessert person, but OMG - do not miss the crème brule! Don't be fooled that is in a little foil cup. It was better than other a high end steak house that I paid $15 for alone.  We're going to the Woodbine location this weekend, I am hoping it's as good as this one... and pray they have the crème brule!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy Mandarin... Buffet is always good, lots of variety, to please even the fussiest eaters!   And the prime rib is as good as anywhere else, including the Keg!  Love the waffle bar too!   And Chinese new year buffet, dumplings, yippee!  And Moon Festival too!"}
{"text":"Honestly? What are you expecting? It's Mandarin - they don't specialize in fine dining and the food is made in huge batches in order to serve tons of people. The service, honestly, is what stuck out to me - our server was clearly new at this, BUT she made up for it with her enthusiasm and pep! The food was okay - honestly the only thing I reeeally didn't like was the fried tofu, which was super mushy and gross, but everything else was decent (their mushrooms were surprisingly pretty good!), and their desserts were good too. Honestly I haven't been to Mandarin in years, and I doubt I'll be back for a while, but sometimes, you just feel like eating inauthentic Chinese cuisine at a buffet!"}
{"text":"This is your typical chinese buffet in which all the food is basically the same as that of any other buffets: steam snow crab legs, tasteless shrimp cocktail, honey bbq ribs, choices of fruit and vegetables with desserts, and soup stations that include wonton and hot and sour.... I'm very disappointed in their sushi selection and it tastes crappy.. don't recommend it..  Stick to fried rice, steam shrimp with vegetables, beef with garlic sauce and steamed crab legs... anything else is just a OK... :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great location closed to home. They have lots different food you can pick on.  What I always look is the devil eggs, I know I have eggs allergy but I always love they devil eggs. Their roast beef really to die for.... Nom... Nom..Nom...'! For the dessert you should try the waffle with vanilla ice cream with Berry topping"}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday. I am blown away by how attentive the employees are.  It seems like there is a person watching your table at all times to see if they can assist in any way. You have to try the shrimp...it's amazing. Save tons of room for dessert. Everything is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my second time being to Mandarin, and the first time being there for lunch hours. The lemon chicken I had along with the Shanghai noodles weren't bad, but I wouldn't say that they're the best I've ever had. Unfortunately the sushi was quite below standard, and was ultimately tasteless. If I were to recommend a time for anyone to go to Mandarin, it would be during dinner time, as the options are much broader and includes the delicious crab legs. Overall, the service was good, and the pricing is fair for an all you can eat buffet, but the food however didn't make much of an impression by the time I had finished."}
{"text":"Average and underwhelming. Came on a brutally busy New Years Day and despite having reserved a table our group waited 45 minutes.  The food options were not terrible but non-pork items were slim pickings for my mainly Muslim group.   The kids enjoyed the pizza though!"}
{"text":"Great food, I have never seen so much variety in a buffet before. Very excited to come try their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"Definitely a place that you have to spend a whole afternoon at! Mandarin has such a good selection of food and it's all so good!!  They don't have a good dessert selection unless you like ice cream but their chicken balls are the best in the business.  It's an all you can eat buffet so it's so fun with a large group of people, you get to have a competition on how many plates you can finish.  You may regret it in the morning, but it's exciting at the time."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner today. Was our first time here.  We were greeted very warmly and were taken to our table where a server introduced himself to us and told us that he will be taking care of us. Throughout he was on top of everything, from water service to bussing dirty dishes. When he went on a break later on, he brought another server and introduced her to us telling us that he is going on a break and that the new server will be taking care of us. We got very nice service. As for the food, it was pretty good. They had a very decent selection of everything. From salads to soups to main dishes to deserts. Everything was tasteful.  We had a great experience and will definitely go there again."}
