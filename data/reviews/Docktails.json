{"text":"Slow service, tiny food from a confusing menu, and a tad bit pretentious. Come see the dolphins then go somewhere else to eat.

***This review was written when the place was called Docktails. Maybe it's changed for the better?***"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is absolutely gorgeous. The views of the dolphins are terrific, it was 115 degrees out and you couldn't feel it because of the well placed shade structures and the misters. The food was all made from scratch as well as the margaritas. The owner, Miriam, actually came by and thanked us for our business and asked what she could do to make it a more enjoyable experience for us. You definitely earned a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Great food and service, friendly staff and awesome atmosphere! Delicious tacos and salads. Must try the caramels chimichanga & sopapillas. You can view the Dolphinaris entertainment while you dine."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! 12 PM and 4 PM you can watch Dolphin Demos for free from your seats. Add to that delicious food and excellent service and this is easily one of the coolest places for a fun meal when the weather is nice, which is pretty much all the time here."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful! It is a perfect spot to have lunch especially during the winter months when the weather is so beautiful! At noon there is a dolphin show that is so so fun!! The service is amazing and the people are so generous and kind!!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. You can have a lunch at a minimal cost and be entertained by the Dolphins while they jump and splash in the water. Eat lunch and watch for free. Tacos were delicious and so was the grilled avocado. The service was excellent and friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Sarah the bartender should be fired for how she talks to people. Not just me but other guests while I was ordering. I've been a waitress for 9 years and never spoken to my guests this way. Not to mention she COMPLAINS about her job while she's doing it so poorly. Saying she has the whole place to work alone, mind you there was about 7 guests there when she said this. Also the place was a mess the entire time. She never once came out from behind the bar. Food sat on the cabana table from 1130 when I arrived to 430pm. I've been twice to the pool and the second time Collin was the bartender. He couldn't be more polar opposite of Sarah. Very kind and helpful. Kept the whole place clean and checked on me multiple times."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Docktails with my family for my moms birthday. The food was delicious but the service was HORRIBLE. The waiter even forgot when my brother ordered dessert for my moms birthday so we cancelled....after we had waited 20 minutes. It was not even busy...on a Monday! I can't even imagine on the weekends...very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, and an incredible view!! You can come watch the two dolphin shows (12 and 4), eat some food, and have a drink. Great experience and competitive pricing!"}
{"text":"Food and service is not great. I asked for water with lemon and he brought it to me in his hand. I ordered the fish tacos and the fish was hard and didn't have much flavor. On the other hand, being able to watch the dolphins swim and jump around is an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with great views of the dolphins.  The food is quality. Service is a little sparse, but it's to be expected.  They get very busy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today,  arrived before the lunch hour.  We were seated right away next to the window overlooking the dolphins! Great atmosphere, my grilled cauliflower salad was really good.  The cauliflower could have used more seasoning but overall, I'll be back. Nice, relaxing place to have lunch!"}
{"text":"Very fun to drop in for lunch especially Taco Tuesday. It's a lot of fun to watch the dolphin show while eating.  I tend to dawdle here because of the dolphins lol.  Really fun ambiance!

The tacos are good! I'm gluten free and had the chicken tacos last time.  I wish they had grilled fish tacos, I'd swear I had them b4 but maybe not.  They have a lot of pub foods.like street corn, etc it's good to check the menu as it's seasonal. They are very quick with refills and attentive.  I wish there were a couple more gluten free items without pork but that's just for me."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. Morning during the week and lunch time on a weekend, and food, atmosphere and drinks were amazing!

Drinks:
Margaritas are fantastic! Especially the honeydew...ingredients are pure and simple with agave and lime and go down so easy in the heat of summer.

Food:

Predominantly Mexican street food. Seven types of taco plates on offer for $12, and each comes with three tacos. Love love love the chorizo and potato tacos! The chipotle crema that covers the well seasoned and crispy fries and an almost stew-like chorizo is beyond indulgent and delicious! Also loved the grilled avocado which is topped with street corn and a jalapeno relish and crema.

Views:
Best aspect of the restaurant. Three pools where dolphins frolic, splash and play with guests.

Cleanliness:
Spot on!!

Service:
Getting our food did take a while although there was only one other table. Cant say that service was amazing but definitely attentive. More friendliness certainly will make a difference!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Docktails for a late lunch this afternoon this is the second time I've gone to lunch here! Service is great, food is AMAZING--carnita fries, rolled tacos, and the Sonoran burger with hot Cheetos on It!!--and you can watch the dolphins from your seat!! They have multiple beers on draft including my favorite--Ohso Brewery Popcycle Blonde and the dolphins do training at 12p and 4p which is amazing to watch! When you can't have the beach there's always Docktails!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar restaurant in the world

The weather is perfect for the playful dolphins

The visitors are happy and from all over the world
The food is fabulous I crave the avacado .... the margaritas are the best in the valley

Notice them margaritas not green!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Where else in the valley can you enjoy an upscale, resort-style ambiance while sitting just feet away from frolicking dolphins? This place is truly unique and wonderful. I ordered the Chopped Salad which was excellent and the service was great. I can't think of a better place to kick back, relax and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost!!! Can say one good thing about this place. Well the water came cold but 35 mins after asking. Staff very rude!!! Good old and dangerous to eat!"}
{"text":"We were sent to this restaurant from their sister location, views. We walked down and there were multiple tables available and we were told it was first come first serve. So we asked the bartender, Alex if he could put two tables together for us and he told us one of them was reserved. So even though we were first informed that it's first come first serve now we can't sit our party of 9 together because of a reserved table.  He made it seem like our request for our family to sit together was inconvenient, and didn't even try to help find a solution.  Once I made a suggestion of moving the reserved table to an equivalent table, we used the previously \"reserved\" table and the one next to it for our party, another gentleman that worked there came to help as Alex continued to be extremely rude and walked back behind the bar. As my sister and I, both holding babies are waiting to sit, we turn around to see Alex mocking us and gossiping with bar patrons about our situation. He was beyond rude and made our family feel so uncomfortable that we decided there is no way we felt comfortable staying or being served by someone like Alex.  I have worked in the service industry for 10+ years and never leave bad reviews even if service isn't satisfactory, but Alex, if that is even his real name, needs to know that how he treated us was rude, disrespectful, and unappreciated. We will never be back which is unfortunate because we have a season pass to the aquarium and the food looked amazing."}
{"text":"I've been twice and love this place tasty food that doesn't disappoint a nice selection of beverages and looking out over beautiful dolphins. Can't beat the $2 Taco Tuesday's !!!! I ordered three and the fried avocado taco is hands down my favorite items or a close 2nd to the rolled tacos  great selection of kids menu Mac n cheese , French fries , fruit, chicken tenders, or quesadillas yum something for everyone."}
{"text":"The fish and steak tacos are amazing and the honeydew margarita is the perfect summer drink . Light and refreshing and does not upset your tummy , like other margaritas"}
