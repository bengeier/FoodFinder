{"text":"Just had lunch from there today, so good! I'm not 100% sure what I had but I think I ordered the Chana Masala, Malabar Chicken Stew and plain Nan bread. Everything was fresh, hot and very flavourful. It was also very reasonable cost wise. I hope that the Owner who greeted us can be successful as it is an amazing Indian food restaurant that Brampton needs. I was much more impressed with this restaurant than any of downtown Brampton's newer restaurants. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by AG restaurant for dinner after a long day of running wedding related errands. The service was great. The owner of the restaurant came personally to greet us at our table. My favourite dish was the butter paneer, it is to die for! But the Meen Pollichathu was finger-licking good!!! My parents loved chicken 65 and beef fry. We ended our meal with Malabar coffee. I would definitely go back to AG for their authentic and yet delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had the best butter chicken and butter na'an bread. I miss this restaurant. Come back to Brampton please!"}
