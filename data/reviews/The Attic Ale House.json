{"text":"This place is beyond amazing.  The food is soooooo good.  The service was amazing.  Our waitress was really good and attentive. It was just a great dinning experience.  We love the craft beers here and the view is a topper. We order the Attic wings and the Ivan burger, they were killer.  When in Arcadia must make a stop here.  They caterer to the late crowds on the weekends.  Wednesday are 10$ for a beer and burger deal.  They ask you don't split it, which is fine because it's a deal.  We can't wait to go back.  It really is a hidden spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, friendly service. I feel like the food is better during normal hours, I popped in for a late burger one night and was a little bummed, but they made it up by taking half off my bill, (burger and 2 beers) 
Check it out! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Not bad overall. the beer ws excellent, the salad was wilted, probably sitting for some time.  Service was slow, up to 10 minutes to get the order after walking in and another 10 for the beer to be delivered.  But you go there for the beer, and their KBS was unbeatable, porter and imperial stout was great."}
{"text":"Best beer bar in Phoenix! Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, one of the best burgers in the state, constantly changing craft beer list (all good)! Recent \"change\" in management has made this place way better. New decor looks great! Try the wings too!"}
{"text":"The peel and eat shrimp were SO good! Totally unexpected here, but delicious and reminded me of eating giant fresh shrimp in Florida. Very good beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Went there for delicious burgers on a Saturday night. Got to the top of the stairs to be informed by some poor staff person that this restaurant is charging a $10 cover because they're showing some UFC fight. WHAT. I guess I wasted that Lyft ride. 

They have a downstairs area (sacks) they've served folks in before. Never mind that it's super weird to charge a cover to watch tv, why didn't they just charge upstairs and not downstairs? We saw several other people leave disappointed. Wonder if they made enough from the cover to make up for the lost business that night and in the future."}
{"text":"Try the pizza or a burger.  Both are very good.  Nice upstairs patio!"}
{"text":"Went here as I heard they had some amazing burgers. They certainly do! I ordered the hangover burger and my boyfriend ordered the ivan. Both were delicious! The fries that came with were also nice and crispy. I ordered my burger medium rare and unfortunately recieved it medium well. I'm not too snarky with burgers so I let that one go. 

The beer list is also pretty decent but pretty pricey as is the menu ($12-14 for a burger, around $7 for draft beer). I'm rating this place 3 stars as the burger was not how I ordered it and our waitress was somewhat slow and not as on the ball as I would have liked. Either way, cool place, nice seating, and a great atmosphere. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If I'm not down the street at The Wandering Tortoise, I'm here! Great beer selections always. Friendly and knowledgeable staff! Jerry is the BEST!!! One of the best patios and views of Camelback Mountain!"}
{"text":"GREAT burgers. Seriously. And a great place to catch the game. But pretty poor service, unfortunately.  :(

Empty glasses, slow service, and even SLOWER wait to get the check. Someone needs to train the wait staff, and this would be an awesome place."}
{"text":"No exaggeration when I say..best burger in arizona. hands down."}
{"text":"The Burger at The Attic is one of those burgers you can judge on looks alone. A glistening patty of beef that sits atop a pretzel bun stacked with fresh and well thought out ingredients. The full list of ingredients consists of a bakery-fresh pretzel bun, 1/2 pound of juicy beef, spring mix, tomato, chipotle mayo, and your choice of cheese (and you have to add the optional bacon). The burger pairs many complementary flavors and a blend of sweet, savory, and spicy along with the combination of fresh premium ingredients will make your mouth water. I'd personally suggest adding on the bacon and selecting provolone cheese. The chipotle mayo does plenty to bring a little bit of kick for your tastebuds. Egg was offered as an upgrade/option but I believe it wouldn't do much to complement all the veggies on the burger, and it would make the entire burger unmanageable. This gem is like hitting the jackpot... easily the best burger in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great beers...... Outstanding!!!But their award winning hamburger was way beneath our expectations. We will order something different next time...WAY over rated...but the beer selection was wonderful."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant! My fiancé and I try a new restaurant every week in the arcadia area and The Attic was next on our list. We arrived there at 5:13pm and sat down at a table in the bar area. As I was viewing the menu to order a glass of wine, there wasn't much of a choice, but I got a glass of the Pino Grigio since I love wine so much. As we waited for my glass of wine, a conversation about baby veil started to take place around the bar. There were 3 gentlemen that started to talk about how awesome baby veil tasted. They went into great detail on how the animal is to be taken away from its mother, have its legs crushed so it can not walk, and put into a sealed container where the baby cow eats little to nothing while all of its muscle is eaten by its starving body. Not only did this conversation start and continue for the next 3 minutes loudly, but the bartender was also involved in the laughing discussion on how baby cows are mistreated to provide human consumption. I then asked for my check and let the bartender know that I was deeply disturbed by the conversation being taken place around the bar. She said nothing to me, and brought me my check right away. The conversation continued as my fiancé paid our bill and we left the establishment. We will never step foot into this establishment ever again. The thought will remain and shame on the staff to allow such conversation to take place and continue in a public environment."}
{"text":"I was recently convinced by a fellow bar patron that I needed to give The Attic another try and I am very glad that I listened to them. The service has improved dramatically since my previous visits that were the catalyst for my prior review. This visit the service was outstanding. Our server greeted us promptly, was super nice, was willing to answer all of our questions, and was very knowledgeable about the food and beer choices. I ordered the Ivan burger and fries, my friends the Sriracha burger, and side salad. Our food was served promptly and the place was pretty packed so that's saying something. As has always been the case, the food was amazing! I am really looking forward to going back to The Attic after this experience, and I am very happy that I gave this place another chance."}
{"text":"This is my go to Arcadia spot for rotating craft beers. They have 21 taps of non-AZ beers, for the most part you will see beers from breweries in CA or CO. The food is great! I come every Wednesday for the burger and beer special. They have featured amazing collaboration burgers with the likes of Little Miss BBQ. There is complimentary valet on busy nights, but I park on a side street if they have valet. Get the Ivan, everytime, all the time. And be sure to check in on Untappd, 100 check-ins for forever happy hour prices. Sunsets....camelback....TVs for days. Best place to go for sour beers at a reasonable price point. Wednesday's any beer and burger for only $10."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  Thursday night was a pizza and beer/wine fir $12, great deal and great pizza. Fantastic view from the second floor of Camelback Mountain."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Great beer great food and good service. I've been here a couple of times and am never disappointed. Look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Ivan burger with Swiss and sautéed mushrooms!!!  Amazing. We sat by the cozy patio fire. Service was very good and the food was great."}
{"text":"This place is kinda cool. You can look out from the patio to see what's happening down below. Burgers are OK.  Not the best I've tasted. They claim to have won some awards for the burgers. Good italian chopped salad.  One thing that is lacking is amount of staff.  They need a few more people working because the service was slow past two times I visited.  They are friendly enough and working hard, they just were at capacity I think.  My in-laws loved this place, so we came back twice. They love a good bar, for some this is it."}
{"text":"If you are a craft beer lover and have not been here you are missing out.  This is the best craft beer bar in Phoenix.  The selection changes daily and the food is fantastic.  This is the only place in town that you will find rare beer on a regular basis.  Ryan also had regular special events like tap take over crab boils that you don't want to miss.  This is a great little locally owned craft beer bar with awesome food."}
{"text":"Great spot looking out at camelback mountain.  They have an ever rotating selection of craft beers and knowledgeable, friendly bartenders.  The wings are very tasty.  

We're bringing a friend back because we had a great time."}
{"text":"Love this  place! Great to take newbies and beer lovers!! Their burgers are monstrous and MOST delicious!! It's a 'go to' when I face the question of 'where do you want to go?', 'I don't know....'  Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a place to go anytime too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance (located upstairs with an outdoor balcony option).  Definitely bar food, but with a twist.  Pretty good food and an extensive beer list!  I believe that they rotate in different beers on tap.  Sat at the table straight ahead when you walk in against the wall.  Went with about six people and the service wasn't that great.  We waited quite some time for the server to come back.  We needed to ask for utensils because we weren't given any after the food arrived.  It definitely was not busy at the time.  I was a little disappointed.  Great food and place for dinner though."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and great burgers.  World famous?!?  Well, that's a bit of a stretch.  I think there are other burgers here in Phoenix that are just as good.  I'm not saying I've come across one that's much better, but definitely on the same level as this.  That being said, if you're looking for an amazing burger joint, this is one of them.  Pair it up with the awesome beer selection and that's what makes this place a cut above the rest.  It's a great location in a great neighborhood.  Prices are fairly reasonable but anytime you go above the $10 mark for a burger, it's a problem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and some quick dinner. The restaurant wasn't too crowded and there seemed to be a good amount of staff. I ordered a pizza and it took over a hour to get it. Many restaurants would offer a discount or at least send over a manager but we got nothing of the sort except for a \"sorry it's taking so long\". They have a great beer selection and decent food but just know the wait can be very long. Can't imagine weekends here."}
{"text":"Great burger! Came here on a Wednesday and their special is a burger and draft beer for $10. They have a wide variety of beers. Very casual attire. Some tv's but wouldn't come here for a game. Once again, GREAT BURGER!"}
{"text":"Nice rooftop venue. Great beer selection with reasonable prices and the food was good. I would recommend the pizza or Ivan burger. Both delicious."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night, amazing food and beer. Great service and chill atmosphere. I would suggest the wings and a burger. Amazing! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a party of 26, called ahead to let them know and they had a table ready for us in the downstairs restaurant. Was given Excellent service and the buffalo burger was awesome. We will be going back there again soon"}
{"text":"Umm....$12 for a pint and a pretzel bun 1/2 pound burger....yup...thats 5 stars.

Service was great, view was great, food was great.

My wife and I are going back next wednesday!"}
{"text":"The Ivan Burger is the best burger I've ever had...honestly, it's better than doing the no pants dance.

No, really. Eat the burger, then hit the good foot, do the bad thing, and compare the experiences. You'll look at the other participant with disappointment that they weren't the hamburger you previously devoured."}
{"text":"OMG! What an awesome burger!! The Ivan with chipotle mayo is amazing!! My family and I had friendly customer service from start to finish!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.
The Ivan Burger is delicious.
Great service
Great beers
Will be a frequent stop for me"}
{"text":"Our server was freaking amazing and funny.   Didn't catch her name.  The food was over the top.   Holmburger is where it's at,  but you might need a shower afterwards.   Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Why the stars??? I'll tell you that it wasn't for the service, mellow atmosphere, or the great burger. It was for the lack of local brews. There are several good locals that would probably benefit from being on tap in a place like this. The craft beer industry is a small industry and needs to grow. Only through local support will this happen. Everywhere in the east coast and west coast there are specialty burger places that serve local crafts, and sometimes exclusively local. I wish I had seen the same here. Great potential to tap into this emerging market yet it is unrealized.

Aside from that the burger was excellent and the fries were \"meh\". The bartender was nice and knew her beers."}
{"text":"Been here three times for their burger and the first time the burger was fantastic but the next two times it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Both times the burger was very greasy and with so much butter it was almost all I could taste. If you like grease and butter this burger is for you.
For $14 bucks I wouldn't recommend it when compared to the litany of restaurants that surround the place."}
{"text":"The Burgers are amaaaaazing and there's a great selection of interesting micro-brews on tap.

Come hungry - the burgers are huge! My hubbie and I had the Ivan Burgers - Top-grade beef, perfectly cooked to order and piled high with classic toppings like greens, onion and tomato with a creamy aioli and your choice of cheese. For $1 add other toppings like bacon on sauteed mushrooms. 

Sit at the bar and get friendly service with views of Camelback mountain."}
{"text":"I found this place through the Arizona Beer week event.  I wanted to try something new for my birthday so I thought I'd give this place a shot.  It is appropriately called the Attic because it is on the top floor of a two-story building.  When you walk in there is a small lounge seating area.  To the left you walk in and see the tiny kitchen that is open for guests to see.  The floor plan is long and narrow with dim lighting and tables on either side against the walls.  The bar is on the left and has seating on the inside and on the outside where there is a good sized balcony with a walled fireplace and tables as well as a bar height top with seating along the outside parameter of the balcony.  I tried the Ivan burger.  This is probably the best burger I have ever had!  It is 1/2 lb. beef burger with your choice of cheese. It is simple and comes with red onions, tomato, and dark green lettuces, and it has a creamy chipotle mayo all on a pretzel bun.  So juicy it melts in your mouth.  It also, comes with sweet potato fries which are also good.  I had the pleasure of meeting the Owner and creator of the Ivan, (named after him of course).  The rare beers they had on tap for the beer event were really good also,  I was very happy that I chose The Attic to go to and enjoy for the evening.   If you are looking for a great burger you must go to the Attic!"}
{"text":"We had heard a lot of hype about The Attic and finally checked it out.  The good: The Ivan burger was huge and flavorful and the pretzel bun was a great touch.  Nice selection of craft beers, including some relatively rare finds.  The not-so-good: indifferent service from the only server working the room. A manager asked if our drink orders had been taken (they had) as he noticed that we had nothing but water after we had been seated for quite some time.  Fries came cold, as if they had been cooked well before the burger.  Two burgers/two beers with tip was over $40.  Not worth the $ when paired with poor service. I would only consider a return on a Wednesday when burger/beer combo is offered for $10."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that serves up awesome, juicy burgers and has a rockin' beer selection. They used to have this insane deal on Wednesday evenings: $10 for the Ivan burger (most popular) and a pint of beer. But the last time we went I think it had changed...maybe $5 off a beer and burger combo. Hey, I'm not complaining, a deal's a deal. And it seems like the Wednesday crowd has lightened. They have an excellent patio with a great view of Camelback. Ask for a side of their homemade ranch--you will want to swim in it. Fries are excellent too. Great service and plentiful beer options."}
{"text":"Early review of the Ivan Burger. Solid. Pretzel rolls scare me b/c they tend to be too dense. This one was just right. Only issue was the burger was a bit oversalted and i'd say hold the mayo/aioli. Otherwise, definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing burger on one of The Attic's Wednesday burger nights and must have it again! It was called the Dim Sum burger but it is not on the menu anymore. Can I still order it? 

I loved the patio and reading some of these other reviews reminded me that my server was Cheryl and she was indeed terrific! The food was delicious and I enjoyed the overall experience.

Now if I could just find out if I can get the Dim Sum burger again? Thanks, Ivan, if you are able to respond to this review."}
{"text":"The burgers here have not lost taste that's forsure ! Every bite is enjoyable and gushing with flavors ! 
Service is great as well as the environment ! 
Always happy to come back !"}
{"text":"Excellent rotating beer list.  Every time I'm in, there's something new and delicious on tap.  Happy hour food specials are great, tacos are delicious, and burgers are delicious as always.  Happy Dillon is back in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I came here for the Wed night 10 burger/beer night deal.  I was really excited for this place and wasn't disappointed on the whole experience, however a few things fell short to bring my rating down a bit. We got the wings to start on top of the burger/beer deal to get our engines starting. I'm a huge fan of wings and if cooked properly with a good sauce can satisfy me the rest of the meal. I asked for my Arcadia Wings to be extra crispy. Unfortunately the wings were not at all. Though tasty and flavorful it didn't have the bite that I asked for. Next were the burgers. We both got the Ivan's and asked for medium. By the time we got them they were  almost well done. A little dry for my taste which makes a burger not a burger. What saved the night was the pretzel bun. If the wings/burger came out as I asked this place would have been epic, but fell short based on those two items. Maybe just a bad night for the staff."}
{"text":"It is easy to miss this rooftop restaurant off of Indian School but it is worth a stop if you are looking for great views and upscale bar food. With camelback mountain in the distance, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy one of their many craft brews while waiting for wings or a burger. While the food is good, the Ivan burger (apparently rated one of the top in the country) is the star of the show. The only thing that could use improvement is the service, which left much to be desired!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The burgers are the best I have had and their appetizers are amazing. The Brie and Candied Pancetta Bruschetta is beyond fabulous. We come often on Wed. for $10 burger and beer. The beer list always changes but is always good. And the burgers, speechless, they are just amazing"}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff, beer, and atmosphere.  Way to go Ryan and Ivan"}
{"text":"Always a great selection of beer, we went on a Friday for a special event....6 beers from Goose Island and Deschutes Class of 88 release.  Both of us had the fish fry, though I am not sure either one of us had the walleye, I think both were perch.  But still pretty good.  The flight was not what I expected, but we really enjoyed the Bourbon beer.  A good pils with the fish rounded out the evening nicely.  It was packed as expected, no valet, had to park across the street.  No evidence of the brewery personnel being on site with swag, as was publicized.  That was disappointing.  Overall not the greatest experience and not up to the usual expectations of this place.  Generally it's our go to favorite."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Great outdoor patio.  Fun and friendly staff! Very knowledgable of their food.  I was told that it was a great burger by the cute waiter.  It wasn't a great burger, IT WAS A FANTASTIC BURGER!!!!  I will be back again soon as it is on my way home from work.  The patio was great, watched a beautiful sunset.  They also had misters going and was nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"Hidden gem where you can relax, eat, and drink. The pizza is amazing and the beer selection is great also."}
{"text":"I ate here one night and I spent three weeks in the hospital. Not only did I have diarrhea but I had a very high fever, I will never eat here again. Perhaps my experience was unique but no one should ever get this violently ill from a burger."}
{"text":"Went there again because we had such a wonderful experience with the best server last time (the sweet brunette girl who really knew her stuff and was a great server)... This time however was the first time in my life my boyfriend and I actually got up and left prior to putting in an order. This completely rude and bitchy blonde waitress knew nothing about the menu and was visibly irritated at our simple questions- do you still have the peach Belgium beer? Which wings are the crispy ones that are not as messy as usual wings? We had these things last time so we wanted them again without looking at the menu. Her answers: beer- whatever Is on the menu, ok which is most like that one then since its not on the menu anymore- i don't know, whatever is on the back was her reply.  wings- whatever is on the menu, ummmm that would be the dry ones- mind you we didnt even look at menu cuz we just wanted what we had Last time. When we asked if they had iced tea and whether it was sweetened or unsweetened she rolled her eyes like too many questions or something. Her entire demeanor sucked. Shes a server and those were basic restaurant questions so that we could have what we had last time, nothing she should have been so visibly annoyed about.  We believe in positive energy so we left and went to Sushi Brokers instead. Please fire that rude server- I wish I had gotten her name. Turned a wonderful experience at a new place right down the road to a place we will need to decide if we will go to again. Their food is excellent but depending on the server, your experience may not be worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good brew house, with good beers and nice appetizers. My main complaint is that despite many unusual draughts, The Attic charges $.50 for a taste/sampling for any of the beers. Really?  Very bush league business practice. Shows a lack of respect for the clientele. Won't be back, won't recommend until they quit pinching fractions of pennies.  Too bad, as otherwise we liked it."}
{"text":"So good that I can only ask that you stay away so that it is not busy or crowded for me!

LOL

Kicks the ass of the Acadia Tavern any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Date night at this second story wine & beer spot with freshly prepared food.

We stop in for a light dinner & drinks and are invited to sit where we like.  We get the last indoor high top table with a glimpse to the outside patio.  

The charcuterie & cheese plates were awesome!  The charcuterie featured at least 4 meats, pickles, artichokes, and a horseradish cheese.  The cheese plate had half an apple, 3 cheeses including an herb cheddar and Brie.  This was served with seeded crackers and crostini straws.  I subtracted a star because they did not explain the charcuterie or cheese types to us and it does not detail the cheese selections on the menu.

I enjoyed chatting in the lively weeknight environment and our service was just enough to be taken care of.  We never had an empty water glass and never felt rushed."}
{"text":"I've always had good service and good food at The Attic, until tonight.  We popped in for a drink, found a nice pair of seats outside on the balcony, and waited.  And waited...  After 10 minutes one of the staff who brought out food for someone else saw us and took pity on us, so we ordered our drinks, and waited.  And waited...  After another 10 minutes went by we decided that being ignored by and not being served by the staff was a big waste of our time.  The irony is: we were only about 3 feet from the bar, and the actual waiter for the area walked past several times, but never even looked at us.  Come on Attic, you weren't that crowded.  You used to be a lot better, our money went elsewhere tonight."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger in Phoenix!  They have the best beer selection around. The manager is awesome and super accommodating.  It is a kid friendly establishment.  Just overall a great dining experience!  A hidden gem no doubt!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: we did indeed try this spot again, and I'm glad to say we had a great time! Great service, amazing burgers and pizza, reasonably priced, great location! Definitely sit outside, there's very few times in AZ that you're able to without dying of heatstroke :) Thanks for a great experience everyone 






Love the location, loved the appetizers and bottle of wine half off on Sunday's!! What I didn't love....... Have you ever had a waitress who is very attentive and friendly? But then it turns into OVERLY attentive and friendly to where it ruins your experience? Oh my. 

I'm all for up-selling as I have been a waitress, but there's a difference from up-selling and basically badgering every time you come by the table. I couldn't enjoy my bottle of wine. My husband was also getting irritated with her. I'm sorry but you shouldn't come by our table literally once every 3-5 minutes trying to get us to order something else. 

After we ordered wine and an app, \"this app is also great, wanna order with your wine?\" \"no thanks, we're just relaxing and will order more in a bit.\" Five minutes later-- \"Wanna order another bottle of wine? Your entree?\" \"Nope, we will let you know.\" 3 minutes later-- \"what entrees are you looking at and I can tell you more?\" Husband asks opinion. She says, \"I'd recommend this, alright should I put the order in?!\" WTF, NO!!! I clearly said I wasn't ready 3 mins prior, and I'd like to eat dinner with my husband when we're both ready! Why is that so complicated? The entire time went exactly like this and we were literally there maybe an hour.. Not all day or anything. It's very annoying and makes me question whether your food is worth it to even come back. Writing this made me more angry and I bumped it from 3 to a 2 star."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Came here by myself July 9th late afternoon for my burger drug. 
Every INDOOR table was taken but luckily some friends were there so I joined them! (Patio was still free.) This Wed. special had The Mountain Burger included. Ham, BACON, fried onions, BBQ sauce, tomato, lettuce, pepperjack cheese. I saw that listing and there was no question I had to have it! And it arrived in under 10 minutes!!
BAM!
It was gigantic. I opened wide and shoved the burger in for that BIG first bite! 
Church was now in session!
Best. Burger. Ever.
The Mountain Burger created a hill which was my belly."}
{"text":"I gotta tell you... these guys are really doing everything right and making a good case to bring people back - and they're succeeding!  I've watched over the past year (from living in the neighborhood) the snowball effect of more and more 'regulars' and more and more smiles in the restaurant.  
My opinion is 3 simple things will bring you back to an establishment:
1)  Good Service
2)  Good Food & Drink
3)  A memorable, positive experience each time you're there
My wife and I continue to be impressed each and every time we go in.  Frankly, they are really finding their rhythm with an unmatched and constantly revolving beer taps, a food menu that is diverse and centered around quality and an ambiance with their patio/TVs, and bar area that is very intriguing and compelling to stick around.  
Bottom line:  It's a craft beer place - first and foremost.  There are At LEAST 20 different beers you'll likely NOT find anywhere else.  If you're OK with traditional beers at traditional sports bars, taverns or medium priced restaurants - that's OK, because their knowledgeable staff will guide you to what you're palate is thirsting for.  My wife likes wine - and they can help you with that, too.  The food menu provides a good range of 'comfort', 'healthy' and 'unique' - but all fresh and the utmost quality.
My personal favorites:  Taco Tuesday, Burger Night Wednesday and Sunday (at 10AM) for their unbelievable breakfast choices!  Seriously - where are you going to find that diversity at ANY other craft beer restaurant!?  
Ultimately, you'll need to give it a try for yourself - leave it up to them to prove to you like they did my wife and I - that you'll want to go back!"}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of dining at The Attic with a small group of friends.  Overall, I'm quite pleased.  The place is cute.  Service was good, our waitress was happy to climb on the table to turn down our fan when we got a little chilly.  She was very genuine with her opinions of the menu and was very excited about her favorites, so we felt confident when we placed our orders.  

I had the Ivan burger because I keep hearing great things about it and the menu boasted some kind of \"top burger\" award.  It was good, for sure.  But I wouldn't put it at number one. Top 10 maybe.  It had all the traditional toppings, including a chipotle aioli that wasn't too spicy for the likes of me.  The beef was tender and cooked just right.  I took half home, and it warmed up the next day to almost the same quality it originally was... that's the mark of a good burger!

The happy hour is pretty good with discounted beer (long list of options), wine, and appetizers.

The Attic isn't really in my neighborhood so I don't think I'll be a regular, but I wouldn't say no to a return trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and Cheryl was the best. Will go back just to see her again!  She provided excellent tips on beer choices! Highly recommend and make sure to ask for Cheryl!"}
{"text":"This place is good!!  Really nice inside atmosphere and when the weather finally cools down, their outdoor patio and fireplace look to be very inviting.   Drinks were plentiful and some of the biggest hamburgers I've encountered.   Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER!!
The vibe of this place is relaxed and I love it. Awesome views of Camelback mountain. The staff are great and the beer and wine selections are on point. 1/2 price wine bottles on Sunday make me happy.
I advise sharing the Ivan burger unless you haven't eaten for a few days. ;)"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! Fantastic burgers, great pizza, delicious beer! Such an awesome beer selection, there is something for every taste.  Service was great too!  I wish I didn't live in Mesa so this could be my go to bar.  Seriously great food and great beer."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service and overall atmosphere was awful. No air circulating in 115 degree weather makes for an unenjoyable dining experience. The server didn't know what I was ordering off of their Sunday special menu because he \"just got there.\" For how few guests were there, it took quite a bit of time for the food to arrive. The burger tasted decent enough but was spicier than I imagined it would be and the sour I had ordered definitely doesn't pair well with spicy. We tried multiple times to get the server (or any server's) attention so I could order something to wash it down but he didn't make it back to our table for 15 minutes after our food had arrived and we were done eating. There was little acknowledgment when we were headed out after paying, either. Overall, very lackadaisical and underwhelming service. 

I won't be back-- I'll spend $40 on a meal somewhere that has personable staff and chilly A/C next time."}
{"text":"Met some friends for a late dinner and drinks. This was our first time at this restaurant. Small space but we didn't have to wait for a table. Fairly loud inside. It was difficult to hear the conversation between the 4 of us. Most of us had the Ivan burger. I have to say... It was pretty darn good. Hubby hates the chairs. He said they were pretty uncomfortable but they didn't bother me. Beer bear and more beer. So good. They have a patio with a fireplace. Once the weather is nice I would like to come back and try it out. Since its on the second floor of the building it would be nice to sit outside and enjoy the people watching."}
{"text":"Beer good, buffalo burger good, service ok, noise ugh, unbearable.   That is my only problem.   Never was part of the conversation as it was so loud.  Will wait until weather is cooler to go outside."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The food was pretty darn good. My SO and I both had burgers and we both impressed! The meat was quality and the toppings were well thought out and tasty. The chipotle mayo was well paired with the burger and I even dipped my fries in it. The atmosphere was comfortable and not too pretentious and prices were reasonable. The view is amazing and I would certainly return."}
{"text":"My first visit and if I didn't have a GPS equipped cyber-phone, I'd be seriously lost Don Quixote-style. But I did find it and trotted up the stairs to the bar. My first impression was that this is a little oddly shaped establishment, but I have a feeling that there are some regulars here. Dipsomaniacs in need of social interaction, aren't we all at times?

The Beer diversity and level of interest
The beers are interesting, but the diversity is skewed. I still liked it though, but two of the beers I wanted to try, they were out of. That quite a lot on a list that contains 12 beers. I want more beers on the list! 

The Service
There is a cute blond behind the bar, and she is working perpetually. She has no need to check in on you and your needs to quench your thirst, so if you want her attention you need to speak up, flag her down. She was clearly unimpressed by the jokes from the peanut gallery, disregarding if it was an homage to her beauty or a annoying applause as she accidentally displaced glassware into the bar or the floor. I cannot imagine working where people stare at me all day. It would be like working in an aquarium - if we disregard the humidity. In regards to the knowledge of the beers, I didn't feel that I was dealing with a brew pundit. 

Conclusion
I did enjoy this place, and time just went extraordinarily fast in here. They do have a rotation and will be getting even more interesting beers on the menu, and that will be very nice to experience. But if I wouldn't already known anyone here, I don't feel the atmosphere is such as I would strike up a conversation with strangers in my lonesomeness."}
{"text":"Not the best selections of beer types among quite a few taps on the list. Asked for my fries well done which they said they'd do and didn't. I also got fewer fries than my table mates. That being said they were ok and the pulled pork was good and also large. The burgers the rest of my family had looked very good. 

WAY too loud. Would not return unless I made sure there wasn't any sports for idiots to scream over on the many TV sets here and the blazingly loud speakers. Too small a space for the noise to bounce around in.

Great waitress."}
{"text":"The. Best. Burger. I. Have. Ever. Had. We're visiting here and one of our friends recommended the attic knowing we are burger lovers. I got the Ivan and my husband got the hangover. We both enjoyed every bite of our juicy burgers with the perfect fixings."}
{"text":"May I give negative stars?  After a long week of coordinating 700 state tests for my school, I felt that I had earned a nice break, so happy hour at the Attic it was!  My friend does barre classes nearby and suggested the place.  I had high expectations- I could say I was disappointed, but that would be an understatement.  When I left there I had intimate knowledge of what it feels like to be treated like a third class citizen. My friend and I were blatantly disrespected by not one, not two, but THREE different employees. They didn't even try to feign any sort of semblance of customer service. I've been to some pretty sub-par places with so-so food and crappy service, but this, by far, was the worst experience I have ever had ANYWHERE.   IT took me a good week to stop being aggressively  pissed off. I can't say anything to the quality of the food because we never got that far, but I can say that if you're feeling masochistic, this is a great choice.  Yours truly, a great lover of a good glass of Pinot (gasp) left an almost full glass there to be poured down the drain.  The saddest part of my whole experience is that they don't even care. The older blonde hostess (who looked to be the manager) didn't even try to pretend to care. This is not some 5 star elite restaurant-and I've been to some- and they certainly don't treat people like this.   I feel it is my duty to warn people to stay away from this place.  Check out Oh-So or Postino or even Chick Fil A for that matter.  Trust me you'll be glad you did. :(.  Still pissed -and it's been a couple weeks.   I live in this area, and trust me I will never set foot in this place again. EVER


Someone requested to know more of the story, here is a kind of synopsis:
Let's see, how to trim down the convoluted story -here it is is a nutshell:  
They knowingly, and rather arrogantly decided to seat another couple before us (the gentleman was wearing scrubs, READ:  doctor)  Then they argued about it (two people).  I saw the couple actually walk up the stairs and my friend's name was already written on their chalkboard.  But, NO, they were right!  Not the couple mind you, the employees!
The waitress/bartender threw our change at us (literally) and said some snarky comments as she walked away (mind you, this is all while we're sitting on the \"waiting\" bench.)  The manager and the other hostess OPENLY talked about us and pointed at us and proceeded to argue with us as we walked out - as we finally made a smart decision and left.  When I left and the valet guy asked how our night was, I asked him if we were on a hidden camera show.  
I told one of my other friends about it and she found a blog called \"How I became a douchebag diner\".  Google it, that pretty much is a parallel to our feelings as we left, but of course more eloquently put."}
{"text":"By far the best things about this place are its Wednesday burger special, its beer list, and the patio view. Try to get there early, as it gets pretty crowded (the parking lot, in particular, fills up really fast).

Tip: Ask for a side of chipotle mayo to dip your fries in. It really takes them to the next level."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here recently! Service was great, they have seasonal beers, and the patio is very pleasant this time of year. They also have this amazing bruschetta (with cheese, pico de gallo and bacon) which is a perfect balance of flavors!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the infamous \"Ivan\" for the first time tonight. This wondrous mound of meat along with a cold pilsner was the highlight of my day. 

The beef patty was thick and made exactly how I ordered it. I added a side of avocado because I like it on my burger. 

The Attic is small inside and parking is limited, but our party of 3 had no problem finding a table at 7pm on a Monday. 

If you're looking for a good burger, I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Holy cow the IVAN Burger is the best burger I have ever had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Outstanding.  Just come here and buy it.  They have a Burger & Beer deal on Wednesdays ... I feel like this burger is good enough to come weekly and enjoy.

Besides the burger, The Attic has Great service and Good Happy Hour Deals.

The only things to watch out for:
The patio is deserted in the summer.  I wish it could be covered more or have some more misters.  Because of that, it can get pretty crowded inside.  I bet when it's not the summer the patio is great though.  I've heard parking can be a pain, but I didn't experience that when I was there.  

Overall, this is an amazing find and I can't wait to return for another Happy Hour soon!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and good food. The fish tacos are good and I love their fries! They have good service and valet parking."}
{"text":"I called the restaurant in November to see if I could reserve the patio for a bridal party dinner. I was given Ivan's name and number as he was the manager and the one I would work with to arrange the event which took place in late January. I figured two months was plenty of notice and, if the restaurant could not accommodate my group of 15-20 people, the manager would let me know.  I had been to the Attic with my friend before (the bride) and I know it is quite \"cozy\" (small) but I figured, if we could reserve the space ahead of time, all would be good. SO, after speaking with Ivan at least three times over the course of the last two months, we show up to the restaurant the day of only to find that we do not have a reservation. It was as if they had no idea we were coming! They seated us at their largest table near the entrance which wasn't large enough to accommodate the entire party. I asked our totally overwhelmed server if Ivan was around and she went to get him. When he comes over, I remind him of my name and that we had previously spoken on the phone and that he had assured me that the outside patio would be available to accommodate our party.  His response was \"I will see what I can do\". 20 minutes later, he has set up tables and chairs for us outside, however, there is still not enough seating for everyone and it was a very tight squeeze with all of the other patrons who were on the patio.  It was clear that my party was somewhat of an annoyance to Ivan's other guests (not our intentions, whatsoever!).  We had to wait for another party of 4 to finish their meal before everyone in our group could have a seat. In addition, it was also clear that the restaurant was not expecting such a large group because our waitress and servers seemed very overwhelmed. It took a couple of my friends 20-30 minutes and multiple reminders to receive their drink orders.  We were at the restaurant for over 4 hours before our meal was finished. That being said, most everyone I spoke with enjoyed their meal and, once we were comfortably seated, the atmosphere was enjoyable.  I think the servers and kitchen did everything they could to make the night go as smoothly as possible and I understand how difficult it is working with such a large group.  The reason I am giving the Attic 2 our of 5 stars is that, while Ivan was able to literally \"squeeze\" us in at the last minute, there was no apology; no acknowledgement that he had inconvenienced any of us as well as other customers of his on the patio that night. My advice, if you do choose to come here, is to come with no more than 4 people and don't bother calling in advance."}
{"text":"Very good place, the restaurant is on the second floor of the building, hence the name \"The Attic\".  My girlfriend and I saw the reviews and the menu and we had to try it out, safe to say we are not disappointed with the service and food both are high quality. My girlfriend got the Southern Fried Chicken Burger, the chicken was tender full of flavor. I got the \"The Ivan\" which highly rated in this place very delicious as well. Outside setting was gorgeous and nice calm. I like this place and will defenetly come back."}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL. 

I ordered the Ivan Burger for pick up at 10:55 pm on a Friday, medium. My order was ready in 10 minutes. I am curious yet skeptical by nature so when I read the claim that The Ivan Burger is in the top 5 of burgers in the world I thought Id give it a shot. Happy to say my skepticism was pulverized!. Coming from Los Angeles there are a lot less gastropub \"foodie\" type places in Phoenix than I am used to and I am glad I found this place. 

The bar was cool, the staff was friendly, and it was very clean. The crowd is pretty mellow but definitely there to drink. They have an ample bar with a lot of craft option. The only Con is that it was kind of confusing to find. Hint: it's called the attic because it is built into like a loft section of a commercial building.

TLDR: Order the Ivan Burger. Go up stairs."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.   Delicious variety of meads and local beers.   Wonderful view of Camelback.   Lots of people at happy hour but not overly crowded.   We came on Wednesday and they have $5 off burgers when you order a beer.   Very good time!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!

A gastropub that not only has mouthwatering food but also great customer service. I'm a beer snob and have no problem admitting it. It's really frustrating to find a place that has great food and great hospitality. (Also with a fantastic beer selection)

My husband and I walked in on 04/18/15 at around 11:20am to grab a bite to eat and something to quench our thirst. We decided to sit at the bar because it was just opening time and figured we would talk to our server/ bartender. SHOUT OUT TO LINDSAY!!! She's been the first person to just talk with us... about the craft brew scene, traveling to different breweries and other awesome beer related stuff. 

Then the food came... I ordered the Holmbuger?? I believe was its mythical name. It was beefy, it was spicy, it was sweet, it was juicy... it was just heaven between two pretzel buns. 

Needless to say we WILL be back because it's not just good food that makes a great place, it's the people that work there and care.

ALSO SHOUT OUT to the guy wearing the Sriracha Shirt (you know who you are) who asked us if we were happy with everything while we were walking out. The fact that this guy sincerely cared about our experience made me want to write this review and give this place the 5 stars it deserves. 

Thank you,
Kerrie"}
{"text":"Best burgers around and great rotating beer selections. Not to mention a fantastic view of Camelback Mt."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town! I also love the great selection of craft beers they have on tap. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there is one female server who has a bad attitude (and we've had her as our server multiple times)."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away with a fantastic view of Camelback, a great craft beer selection, and some very tasty food. Perfect place to meet some friends and chill out over some good food."}
{"text":"I have to say I've been on a burger binge for the last 2 months and I have to give my honest opinion about the Attic, it wasn't the greatest burger I've ever had.  I went there on Saturday evening and there was only one cook and the burger showed because of it. The bun was the only good thing, I also paid a dollar more for the grass fed beef, couldn't tell the difference.  Service was slow and if the burger was built up to what \"they\" say it was then a slow service would have been forgiven. After reading the name \"the attic ale house\". Well that should have said it all."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.  A little hard to find, not a sign that is easily visible from the street or at least not that I saw.  But cool place upstairs.  very nice people that worked there and served us.  I had two beers, the honey and a strawberry.  I liked the honey a lot. Was very crisp.  For the burger I ended up ordering the Holsom burger sorry i forgot what the name of it was and no menu online. They need a website.  Well the burger had bacon, candied jalapenos, some crack sauce, pepper jack (i got it with cheddar), lettuce tomato and grilled onions all on a pretzel bun.  Needs the stiff bun or it would disintegrate a regular one.  Very good burger, not the best i have had, especially for the price.  Why the i gave 3 star rating.  Maybe give it 3.5.  Good, but not great.  I'd come back.."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. Great recommendation indeed!

The atmosphere was great, it felt like I was out of town like in a real big city - if you know what I mean. 

Service was outstanding. Our server was very friendly, always made sure to check in and at the same time gave us our space. Wonderfull!

Food, I had mussels and as picky i am with sea food - I would order them again for sure. We also shared a pretzel and it was great! Prices are reasnoble as well.  

I am looking forward to a cooler weather outside to be able to seat on their beautiful patio."}
{"text":"1st visit:

Group of 8. Varying tastes.

Great beer selection. Very good food. Service was friendly, but not expert. Good atmosphere. Recommend outdoor at sunset."}
{"text":"Get the bruschetta for gods sake !! Also always, always get Cheryl at the bar for your daily dose of amazing bar service"}
{"text":"I could go on about the epic burger, the fantastic service, the views, constant rotating taps, etc. or I could say that it's the perfect neighborhood hangout for beer heads...  But if I did those things you would all want to go and then I would never get a seat... So I will remain silent and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Was craving \"the best burger in Phoenix\" and polled my network online for recommendations. The Attic came up repeatedly as a reco, so the boif & I decided to make the trek across town to give it a whirl. Amazing burger, although I have to say I think the fries are even better. 100% satisfied and glad we tried something new tonight for dinner. The pizza looked and smelled amazing. May need to return to give that a try!  Of note: Tuesday night is Happy Hour all night with an extensive craft beer selection and discounted apps. Wednesdays are $10 burger + beer special."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, mainly because we liked the restaurant prior to it becoming the Attic.  I will admit the food is really good, the beers are great, and the decor is my style.  

So why the two stars then?   

The biggest problem this place has is customer service.  It is poor, at best.  The two times we have been there the staff were either rude or they ignored their tables.  Very well could have been understaffed but it happened twice.  This is a real shame because the food is excellent and I love the location.  The only thing keeping me from coming back is the poor service I've experienced both times I've been there."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for about 7 months.  Due to their hours and location I just haven't been able to get over here until now.  The Attic is a great spot on the south side of Indian School and 44th St.  It seats around 30 people I would estimate.  Great patio looking directly at Camelback mountain.  

We ordered the meat platter, a pretzel with hot mustard, and the Ivan burger.  The meat platter for two was huge and consisted of prosciutto, cappicola, salami, red bell peppers, pickles, crackers, bread, and cheese.  It was pretty good.  I would have liked some olives and figs to add some sour and sweet to the plate.

The hot pretzel came out fresh and to our surprise it was Asian hot mustard not regular mustard.  The Ivan burger was very big with a huge pretzel bun.  It was very very good.  Fresh, juicy, and good toppings.  I cant say its the best burger Ive had in AZ but I would never turn it down that's for sure.

This was enough food for three people to share and still be full.

The beer selection was the highlight for me.  21 beers on tap and no BS domestic listed.  This is how its done future restaurateurs.  Take notes.  I enjoyed a Stone enjoy by and it was outstanding.

I am looking forward to coming back again and trying out some other items and taps.  Wish they opened earlier during the week for lunch and Id be back sooner.

It would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues: valet parking is not convenient when the parking lot is so close by, our beer menu was filthy, the waitress didn't fill up our drinks the entire time and it took a while for our food, not a full bar service."}
{"text":"Still the best burger in town - bar none. Great beers and service too. The value on Wednesday is exceptional. We shared an app, an Ivan, and I had two great pilsners for $25 before tip. Wings were a but rubbery, but tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service, good food, great selection of drinks! The Two Brothers Pizza is great and their burgers are great too."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger person but I find myself craving the burger from The Attic! The pretzel bun is wonderful and the burger was just perfect. It was cooked medium and was not at all greasy, which is my usual gripe with burgers. The patio is very fun and I like looking over Indian School. The Happy Hour specials were decent and I was pleased with the selection that they have for drinks. Our server was friendly and attentive. I'm excited to come back and try more food. If I like all of it as much as I liked the burger, I might bump my rating up to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We LOVED the burgers here, but i had heard some scary stories from ppl who had worked there. I ignored these stories and continued eatiing there until i got food poisoning. Threw up every hour, all night long. Super disappointing :("}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, good food, nice 2nd story patio.  Chill atmosphere,  TVs and good music."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover, go to the Attic Ale House. Their taps are always rotating and I don't think I've seen the same beer menu there at all (and I've gone a couple times in one week). Although I'm not super impressed with their pretzel on the app menu, their bruschetta is delicious and so are their pizzas and burgers. They often have specials (i.e., special price for a beer and burger, or beer and pizza, etc) and they're totally worth it. It's a fun atmosphere with a patio that overlooks Camelback. It has a ton of TVs if you're also looking for a fun place to watch a game (without having to go to a huge place). It can get pretty crowded during big games though, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great location with a nice patio and view of Camelback mountain.  Wide selection of unique beers. The wings I had were pretty good. I wasn't hungry enough to order the huge burger that looked awesome as it kept passing by. Enough tv's to catch a game. Downside was that service was slow enough to be kind of annoying. Other than night, nice place to come chill for a little bit."}
{"text":"Pretty good beer selection, food is decent but not mind blowing, but the space is awkward and parking is sometimes quite difficult. We have been here a couple of times, and it's pretty consistent, which is also nice."}
{"text":"Came in town to visit family for my bday and decided to stop here. It was burger day so we got Holmsburgers and a Sicilian Pizza  and they both were really good! The waiter was nice and attentive and we really enjoyed ourselves. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. Orgasmic food. Outstanding service - seriously one of the better spots in Phoenix. Try the holmburger. Jordan was our server and she was great and knew the menu up and down. Oh and did I mention - killed patio!! A must stop when visiting arcadia."}
{"text":"Such a good find. The rotating tap and bottle list is very impressive. Burgers are great. Wednesday nights are the best for their weekly specials."}
{"text":"The Attic has great food and a great beer selection.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was slow (although friendly).  It seemed that they only had one person waiting tables on a Saturday at 1pm, so I understand that she was a little busy.  The bruschetta appetizer is DELICIOUS - would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed burgers and fish tacos with beer while sitting on the patio watching a monsoon roll in. This place is within walking distance so as the weather cools I know I will be back often."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food and beer places in the valley. I've been here several times over the last year and always appreciate the friendly service and the consistently quality food. The only downside is it is a bit of a drive from my residence. My favorite item would be the Ivan burger, it's a substantial and tasty burger. On a side note I went to their Boulevard Brewery event last night as I saw they would be serving Kansas City style barbecue. I had the brisket sandwich with potato salad and mac and cheese, that was some of the best barbecue I've had! The brisket was well cooked with great taste and consistency. Hopefully they make barbecue a regular part of the menu at some point in the future. I am a fan of the Attic and I enjoy being a customer!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check out this place after work since it was close. As the name suggests, the Attic is not found on the ground floor! Walk up the stairs to the second floor and you'll find the Attic. The sign that greets you says to seat yourselves, so we chose prime seats on the patio overlooking Camelback Mountain. Happy hour is 4-6:30pm, Mondays through Fridays, and features $2 off all appetizers, $1.50 off beer by the glass, and $2 off wine by the glass. The beer selection changes frequently and there's a decent wine list (I got a Moscato and my friend got a cider). For food, we ordered the fish tacos (a bit cold) and the bruschetta with pancetta (good flavor, but a bit cold). Service was fair, not awful, not stellar. 

Solid place to hang out after work. I will probably come here again to try one of their burgers and to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Sign at entrance directs you to seat yourself, sat down at a table and waited over 15 minutes without ever being served. Finally flagged down a waiter to at least bring us a menu. Another 10 minute wait with no service, and we gave up. Food may be good, but it does not count if you never get to eat it."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at The Attic the first time I came. However, I've gone to burger night every Wednesday night for awhile now and I have been continually amazed by the quality of the burgers! It has become my favorite spot and it's by far the best burger I've ever had. The pretzel bun is exceptional and ranch is outta this world."}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of Yelp friends, had a great time.  Hamburger was great, nice beer selection.   Lively atmosphere despite being a Tuesday, it was really busy.  Can't beat the $10 burger + beer deal.  Easy 5 stars except that on this evening the service was slower than the 2nd coming of Jesus, I think there was 1 lady serving every table in the place."}
{"text":"It was late and our stomachs were growling but everything around us was already closed so we went here thinking that they would only be serving bar food at 10pm   (trying to eat healthy these days!) but ended up having the most delicious Greek salad with tons of veggies and homemade yogurt feta dressing!  Their fantastic beer selection changes daily and will send the beer connoisseur's tastebuds wild. My boyfriend got their award winning Ivan burger on a pretzel bun and licked his plate! We left with a smile and happy tummies. We will most definitely be back soon!! (& love that it's only a bike ride away from our house with a perfect open air patio!)."}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday Funday and had a great time! We sat out on the patio and enjoyed their large beer selection. We started with fried abaca do and a shrimp and cocktail sauce appetizer, both were delish! We all ordered burgers for the main course and they were all amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When considering the generally \"bro\" like nature of most of the 'Phoenix hot spots,' The Attic is a breathe of fresh air when looking at their attention to fine craft beer and artisanal, gastro-style selections.

The Attic has the best burger in the greater Phoenix area that I've had.

Close in regards to other great burger spots in the area, but what set the Attic apart was a fine attention to detail in patty flavor, consistency, and freshness and less about adding flare to cover up a bland patty. It was juicy, buttery, meaty, and had the perfect consistency for a medium well patty.

The craft beer selection (unlike the other \"craft beer bars\" in the area) had balls and didn't focus on the general low ABV wheat beers with fruit added that Phoenix is known for.

Complete with bold selections from a triple IPA from Founders brewery and an Horchata Imperial stout from Elevation, the Attic has 21 taps filled with rarities and craft-tastic options. 

The Attic is a must if you enjoy great food and craft beer.

Go there immediately."}
{"text":"Ordered the hangover burger. Absolutely delicious. The pretzel bun really makes it. Great variety of craft beers . Very laid back place with great service. Very unpretentious . Next time you are in the Arcadia area , head over"}
{"text":"I have to say, one of the best burgers EVER ... The Ivan cannot be missed and the beer selection awesome ... Met Steve and staff were all friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I'm sure the food is great as recommended by friends.  I sat myself as instructed by one of the waitstaff.  Took me 10 minutes of waiting before I asked for a menu.  Took another 15 minutes before I left.  No service for me.  I'm highly disappointed by the lack of service."}
{"text":"So my Aunt has been raving about the burgers here.  I like a good burger joint, though this place isn't technically a burger joint.  It has pizza, but its not a pizza spot.  The inside is like a sports bar, but its not really a sports bar.  It has a decent wine and craft brew selection, but its not really a brewpub.  So okay, this place is pretty much impossible to classify.  Which I assume is pretty much the idea.  For the record, I am aware of the social media snafu that occurred here months ago where the general manager viciously attacked an angry customer on social media for her poor review.  I guess the fact that this business is still standing must mean they took appropriate action to satisfy their patrons (or at least I hope so).  At any rate, my experience didn't have any drama, but did involve some good food.

Didn't do any appetizers here as I was told to come here for one reason.  The Ivan.  This burger was so hyped by my Aunt it was borderline ludicrous.  The specs:  a pretzel bun, huge juicy patty, tomato, your choice of cheese (I went cheddar), mixed greens, and chipotle mayo.  Fantastic burger.  The chipotle mayo and the pretzel bun absolutely make the difference.  Quality of the beef was excellent.  I got mine with a side salad, but you can get fries too.  For dessert we got the chocolate molten cake.  This was a disappointment.  The texture of the chocolate was fine, but the cake itself was rock hard.  It was edible, but not especially impressive.

The service we received was friendly throughout.  Our waitress got confused by a couple of the orders we put in, but quickly rectified the situation so no need to dock her too many brownie points for that.  Tonight they had discounts on their burgers so I saved $4 on the Ivan.  Total cost for tonights meal including the burger, side salad, a beer, and a chocolate cake, tax and tip was about $25.  I'd definitely come back to try some of the rest of their menu. A couple of tips, get here early as parking in the area is pretty limited.  Also, sit outside if the weather is right.  Its not as noisy and has a great view of the Arcadia neighborhood.  And take it from me, the Ivan lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Believe the Wednesday burger night hype, honestly never been their any other day.  Great beer selection. Servers can seem stressed but do you see how many people go here on Wednesday I'd be wiggin out to."}
{"text":"This place was recommended  by a co worker because of the burgers.  Decent place and my guy and I decided to split a burger and ordered a MEDIUM cooked cheddar n bacon burger w/fries. At first burger came (cut in half for us to split) and it was clearly RARE!  Tons of pink (which the boyfriend cannot stand).  We explained to the waitress and she completely agrees and returns to the kitchen. After a short time the burger returns cooked WAY MORE to a medium however the fries sat while they took the burger, recooked and put BACK ON NOW SOGGY/BLOODY BUN! This burger plate we AGAIN return that and request a new bun and remotely warm fries. The waitress apologizes and agrees to make a new burger (very nice btw). So new burger comes promptly and.....PINK!!  Ugh! I was ok w/the pink this time but my (prefers hamburgers of 'leather' status) man was unhappy.  So after going through all this we finally ate .....and .....NOT anything to write home about.  The meat was decent but NOTHING i'd tell friends about.  If I'm gonna pay $13-14 bucks a burger it better taste above most else and this DID NOT. It was decent but so is some neighborhood bars for $8.  They did take 50% off our burger which was really cool I felt but....we most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  We had a burger, fries and wings.  Sean minor was yum.  The beer selection however was lacking."}
{"text":"Decent place. I like the location! Upstairs but very small. Only serve their beers and a few wines. No liquor or outside beers. We went with a large group and all tried a different burger, but the only one I remember what the Holmberge! It was delicious!! Saracha Candies Bacon and jalapeños.... Soooo good! A little heat and a little sweet! I'll be back for that burger but that's about it!"}
{"text":"Cute spot and a nice happy hour. It's located above a restaurant and has a beautiful view from the seating on the patio. The bar opens up to the outside patio. I thought it was a nice balance of lounge and patio with a few TVs for those interested in watching a game. There's a gorgeous fireplace with a few outdoor sofas at the center of the patio. As for the food and drinks, they were good. I enjoyed the fish tacos. Service was great as well. They also have free valet  parking when you drive in. Nice touch."}
{"text":"We were completely ignored for 15 minutes. Multiple servers walked past us multiple times and never said a word. In fact, it was awkward watching them avoid eye contact with us. They only had about 6 tables of customers in there so it certainly wasn't due to the restaurant being slammed. The worst part is we got up and walked out past two servers and they didn't say a word...they could have cared less. There are far too many options in Biltmore/Arcadia to have that type of customer service. They ruined our night out and we would never return."}
{"text":"Cheyrl is wonderful!, pretzels are the bomb and a requirement you've never been here before.  If you happen to be lucky enough to stop by when the have deep fried artichokes on the app menu then you are lucky indeed!  Couch loungey by the fire place outside.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. If there were grown ups serving us (everyone that works here seems to still be in high school) I would have given them a five star. The beer selection is fantastic, my veggie sandwich was amazing. My friend said his burger was the best he's ever had. That's a BIG compliment. Since the service was not good, they only get 4 stars.

UPDATE: Am I the only one who gave this place a decent review (above) to get back the most crude, inappropriate message back from a \"Jesse T\"? Jesse: learn to speak English. 
The Attic: if this is one of your employees, you should kindly ask them to stop sending messages to yelp reviewers. They will single-handedly ruin your business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Consistently good service, food, and most importantly beer. They ALWAYS have new beers on tap. You can tell their chef really knows their stuff. The specials are solid and you can't miss with the regular menu. I'm so happy this place is within walking distance of my house."}
{"text":"I pretty sure I had a good time here.  I can't say I'm positive because of the beer I had.  Thankfully I took a picture of the menu so I know what beer to blame, or thank, for this night I no longer remember.  Shmaltz He'Brew Jew Reborn at an ABV% of 17.0.

I do remember really liking the table I had, a great view of the sunset and I had an awesome burger, the Ivan.  Once I made it halfway though the beer though the night fades away in my memory. 

I'll have to go back to verify I did like this place, and maybe take more notes or something while I try the Reborn again."}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool spot. We were riding around looking for a cool spot. We went in for a while. Decent spot with a patio. 

Mainly a beer and wine place. Tried one of the beers. It was cool. We only stayed for one drink. 

They had some TVs as well. Staff was pretty cool. He even recommended some other spots that had a full bar in the area."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, beer and fancy bar food... Service has always been great, beer menu is constantly rotating, we've never had to wait and theres always new food. Its a little on the pricier side, but I feel its appropriate given the quality. My only complaint is one time it was too loud, but other times we've been I didn't notice that so who knows. The place can be a challenge to find, just look for the iron gates and the fountain and then go up the stairs. I'd also love for there to be a couple more fruity/cider style beers."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for dinner on Friday night. We loved it!!  The way it is on the second floor of this building is so unique to Phoenix, where everything is on the ground. The views of camelback mountain are beautiful. They have a new draft menu every night. I had the ginger cider which was good. We started with the arcadia attic wings. They were a little sweet with a spicy kick on the end.  Good but next time we will try the buffalo wings. My husband had The Ivan burger and I had the Hangover burger. Both on pretzel buns and chipotle mayo. The patties were juicy and cooked to perfection   And savory. But what set mine above his was the fried egg. Don't get me wrong, his burger was delicious but mine was DELICIOUS!!!!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome.  I like the decor and the set up, LOVE the patio - can't wait to put that to good use in the winter.  

The beer selection seems good, but the couple I tried wasn't impressive.

The burger was a bit greasy and light on the red onion (if the patty's so gigantic why would they just put a shaving of red onion on it??).  The santa fe dry rub wings were a little gross - too much chili powder? - the powder was just too much and not very good.  The chipotle ranch sauce that it comes with was good though and used it for my fries.  The flatbread pizza was too light on the red sauce.  The crust was decent.  

The service was SLOOOOOOOW.  

This is definitely more of a place to relax and drink than to eat.  The atmosphere and service says as much.  The food doesn't seem to be the focus at all.  Seems like maybe they should put a sign pointing to the front door or something too."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! The view is awesome. We try to go once a week. This past week we tried their fish tacos, they where amazing, and of course the Ivan and beer on Wednesday is the best."}
{"text":"Really cute vibe! It sits on the upper part of a building in Arcadia. Food was decent but the Santa Fe wings were very bland. My friends had a pizza and burger and said both were good. Great selection of beer. I'd probably give it another try and get something else."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love coming here for burgers and their selection of beer/wine. We haven't tried the pizza yet, but we've heard good things about it! The service is also great. We brought our small dog the first time we came and they were very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Heard lots of people rave about it; unfortunately our experience was not as pleasant. I could over look the poor service if it was exceptional in other areas (ie- beer list, food). Our dry dusted Santa Fe wings were dry to the point of making us cough. Ok it says dry in the description so I can't complain but they lacked flavor. It was like they took spices from their mothers kitchen and just drenched them.DONT ORDER THEM! The meat platter was alright; decent at best. Artichoke salad.... Terrible. The only saving grace to this evening was the pizza, but we had to scarf it down to get home to our kids because our server never stopped by to take our order past the wings. We had to flag her down. All in all, I don't typically write bad reviews, but I felt that the 4 stars that this place holds reflects poorly on it's actual food, service and selection."}
{"text":"Went in to check out the place for the first time since I live in the area and hoped I could possibly make it a regular spot. As we walked it the staff was super unorganized and had to wait. After waiting a moment they asked if we were on the list and stated \"not yet\". The young guy walked away without placing us on a list and after several minutes he asked if we were ok and still didn't place us on a list or let us know how long the wait was. Too many good places to eat to put up with this type of attention. As we walked out they could care less about losing business. I refuse to give my money to a business that has zero customer service."}
{"text":"This is a joint review between my girlfriend and I. I gave it 4 stars she convinced me to give it 3... great beers, the rotation on beers is wonderful. This place has the BEST wings in Phoenix!!!! (Only the Arcadia attic Louisiana style).... was a fan of the Asian style wings (but they got rid of them as fast as their rotation of beers)... really like the scene but wish they focused more on prime time venues on tv's... every single tv is on the Kentucky Kansas game, would have liked to see the Baylor-ole miss game that came down to the wire."}
{"text":"Food and environment are cool but service is pretty slow. We went in on a slow Sunday night and waited over 30 mins for food with zero refills"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Had the Ivan and fries and also the bruchetta. Oh dear God it was all incredible. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Our server Cheryl was wonderful too...very helpful and extremely funny. Love this place. I could go on and on but I just got home and about to go into a blissful Attic-fueled food coma. Ahhhhhhhhhh......."}
{"text":"I had a great experience today at the attic great location and the muscles in white wine were fab!!!!! I can guarantee 100% I will return!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service left a lot to be desired. No offer of water. The waiter walked by a half dozen times before dropping off a menu. Slow delivery of food. Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Awful service and bartender not the nicest. Food is okay but service is so bad makes the food worse. Not a place I would go to often but the view is amazing so that makes it a 3 star. Nothing else nice to say so keeping it at that.."}
{"text":"-When we arrived, the atmosphere was quite laid back.
-Decent selection of beers on tap
-Knowledgeable and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday to grab a beer from their extensive list and a little snack.  The view of Camelback Mountain from their second story patio is beautiful.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant/bar has a laid back vibe to it.  We shared a pretzel and it was quite tasty...the mustard and spicy cheese were great for dipping too.  Looks like they have some great food specials to go along with their beer focused menu."}
{"text":"Not to bad, nice cozy area. Check out the video. Split the burger and pizza with friends. Burger was really good, the fries need some help. The seemed old and soggy. Pizza was good also, nothing to write home about. They could of used more staff, the server was sweet but had a lot of tables, I had to chase her for a couple of things. The view was cute, open patio. Would I go back, only if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice service, facilities, location food and Drinks. Overall is a great experience! The bartender was ver attentive and talkative. I will recommend this anytime.  For food the burgersare amazing!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burgers & the selection of draught beers.  Noise level is definitely not \"average\" as Yelp states.  Actually really loud.  I would and will come back!  Well done Attic management."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect after reading the reviews but I have to say, I was very surprised. I went on a Saturday afternoon, around 4pm. I had a hard time actually locating the restaurant because it's not very noticeable (meaning they need a bigger sign). Anyways, you have to walk upstairs to get to the place but I didn't mind that at all. Me and my bf were greeted by two very polite men that were behind the counter and we were prompted to seat ourselves wherever we'd like. I love that :) anyways, we ordered the bruschetta and pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel was good as well as those little cheeses and mustards that came with it. The bruschetta had a little too much tomato and Brie. The entrees we had were 'The Ivan Burger' and the Margherita pizza. Both were very delicious, the pizza was more than I expected..i definitely would come back just for it. Our waitress was very cute and nice and  knowledgable but I forgot her name. But this place is very cool and next time I come back I will try their patio. Did I mention that it has a fire place?? Yep I'll be back."}
{"text":"They always have great beers on tap as well as a nice bottle selection.  The Arcadia wings and burgers are excellent.  Wednesday night is their $10 burger and beer special night and I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Burger night never disappoints! It's become family tradition to come on Wednesday nights for $10 beer and a burger. The wait is between 20-30 minutes during dinner hour (SO WORTH IT) but the staff/service/food is usually extremely quick and delicious. This week I tried their new SLC burger paired with a Founder's Devil Dancer triple IPA"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers in town, aside from the obvious being that it's named after me (the Ivan Burger), it's actually a good burger! Staff is always pleasant and their ever-changing taps keep things interesting. We usually go Wednesday nights for their Burger + Beer special, which is only $12 or $14 depending on the beer you choose, and absolutely worth it. My only complaint would be that their burger isn't always cooked how I ask, it's either medium to well, or rare, and I love medium rare, but being that it's so delicious, you hardly even notice."}
{"text":"Lots of beers available. Several wines available as well. Good selections of both beer and wine to choose from. Burger and a beer for $10 every Wed. after 4pm. The burger is awesome, one of the best around as of late. Great deal. Nice patio overlooking Camelback Mtn. Live music on occasion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Go on Wednesdays for the Beer and Burger Special for $10"}
{"text":"This is one of favorite happy hour haunts. Every day until 6:30. $1.50 off drafts, and they have a great craft selection, and half off appetizers, including wings. We had a pizza this visit and it was excellent! Thin crust with just the right amount of char on the edges. On top all that, you have friendly, efficient service, and great views of Camelback Mountain. Check it out."}
{"text":"The great thing about the attic is the consistency. Always great food, always a great beer selection, and very consistent friendly service. But mainly the beer selection!! Love love this place - here every week!"}
{"text":"FYI, If you're into fantasy football, they have an Attic League which is free to play and is played on a game by game basis. In other words, the league plays just SNF for example then starts all over again for MNF and TNF. My point: if you play, you get special deals as a member of the Attic League (this week for example: $4 on any draft beer, $4 glass of wine, 1/2 off appetizers & 1/2 off growler fills). You just show the bartender your team on the leaderboard as proof. Plus there are prizes for game winners and weekly winners."}
{"text":"Don't understand what all the fuss is about? They do have a great craft beer selection but almost everything is a 12oz pour ranging in price from $7 to $8.50 which is a bit pricey if you ask me! When we inquired about the wine about half of them weren't in stock. The fish tacos were good but nothing spectular and parking is flat out horribe. The major upside to this place was the sweet patio overlooking Indian School and the quick service. I would definitely trek the 1 mile to OHSO for a beer/ hangout if in the area again."}
{"text":"This is a cute place to come and start your Sunday Funday! 1/2 off bottles! The service was really good. We didn't get to try any of the food but it will be on the bucket list for next time. Love the ambience of this place. I hear great things about this place and I'm glad I finally came to try it."}
{"text":"Good craft beer selection and an excellent burger. I like the small outdoor second-story patio. They also show the games/fights on the handful of indoor and outdoor TVs."}
{"text":"Dear Chef: you should take the ceviche off from the specials or at least call it cucumber spicy slaw. That is NOT ceviche and that is NOT agua chile. Beer selection is good. Place is good. Food okay. I would give it 2 1/2 stars total."}
{"text":"My review might be slightly more helpful because I wasn't here on a Wednesday Night for the phenomenal Wednesday Special like almost everybody else was here for.

The menu is very limited and for the most part you are going to order a pizza or a burger and drink wine or one of the many craft brews they feature.

I can't say we had the best burgers out there anywhere because I haven't been everywhere but I can say we had some doozies of very good burgers priced less than Vegas and better than what we had in Las Vegas at one of those specialty burger places. 

Ivan Burger $12.00
Hangover Burger $14.00
Most craft brews run an average $8.00
VS. Las Vegas close to $20.00 a Burger

They only have a couple burgers to pick from on the menu and they can be altered slightly. I went with the famous Ivan burger. It is extremely large and is a half pound burger patty with the usual lettuce,tomato,onion, choice of cheese chipotle Mayo on a pretzel bun. It comes with tasty battered fries. My burger was cooked a perfect medium just like I asked for and had a nice crust. It was a very juicy burger but not too much as it didn't fall apart. The pretzel bun was strong enough to support all the weight of the sandwich fillings. It really was a tasty burger. 

I think at least half the people out there might think like me and admit the burger is too large. I split the burger in half because I knew that would be plenty. But would have enjoyed it more if it was smaller so it would be easier to manage. For me it was very thick and still delicious but too thick.

My husband tried the Hangover Burger. It's basically an Ivan Burger but with an added egg and he said really good bacon. I don't know how he ate that whole sandwich but he did and said he had to because it was really good.

The Attic is located above a sandwich shop and uses the name Cave and Ives on the outside of the building and on the receipts. The steps are easy to climb but if you are handicapped an elevator is available.

The burgers we had were VERY GOOD!
The Pizzas looked good!
Lots of craft beers."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I typically like this place. Good burgers and good service, but one bad experience can out weight many others. Our most recent date night was definitely on my list of worst restaurant experiences. They got the order for our burger wrong and did not offer to correct it. Instead insisted on bringing another bun with no sauce or onion. Although annoyed we agreed but when our bill came we saw that they charged us for an \"extra bun\" . Well the other one was just thrown away so not sure what the extra charge was for. We had it removed before paying but I'll it was definitely not a good customer service experience."}
{"text":"The Attic is the new name for Cave & Ives. It's been taken over by new owner (who happens to be very familiar with Cave & Ives), but all the elements we loved about Cave & Ives are still intact. The official grand opening for The Attic is in August, but they are in fact open now!

We were so bummed when Cave & Ives closed in April. It was our favorite restaurant in the valley. We used to drive 40 minute to get there at least once a week. When we heard that Cave & Ives was reopening under a new concept and new name, we were hesitant to go back. We didn't want to ruin the fond memories we had of Cave & Ives. Now we kick ourselves and say, \"Why have we not been back sooner!\"

As soon as we walk through the door, we were greeted with familiar faces and some very pleasant surprises. Ryan, the bartender that we loved for his great service and beer knowledge, was still there. In fact, they added more taps and now serve even more varieties of beers than before. They no longer have the large selection of bottled beers, but their draft beer selection was, and is still, very impressive. If you don't know what to drink, ask Ryan. He will not steer you wrong. In fact, we often choose to sit at the bar because Ryan is there. 

We were ecstatic to see that the menu hasn't changed too much either. The burger is still being served and all the pizzas are still the same. If you go to The Attic for the first time, YOU MUST ORDER THE BURGER!!! Ryan just informed us tonight that their burger was named one of the top 10 burgers in the United States! The Burger is a grill 1/2 lb. patty topped with grilled onions, chipotle mayo, spring greens, on a pretzel bun with your choice of cheese, and a side of French fries. If you can, order the bacon, sautéed mushrooms, and blue cheese.  You can also order The Hangover Burger, which is the burger with a fried egg and bacon strips. If you're into spice, ask the server for Da Bomb. They keep it behind the bar. Our second favorite item on the menu (by a very close second) is the steak salad. They didn't have it this time, but Ryan assures us that the steak salad will also be coming back soon.

We were so happy that the experience of going to The Attic has not diminished our memories of Cave & Ives. The new décor with darker walls and pops colorful art is a plus. The music choices and more relaxed atmosphere made the place better. We also discovered that they added a burger challenge to the menu. Each challenger will need to each more than the last challenger (1 more patty, 1 more egg, 2 more strips of bacon). The winner gets to rename the burger and get their picture up on the wall. My husband is psyching himself up to doing the challenge on Tuesday! 

The Attic might be a different name, but same location, great service, delicious food, and excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE ATTIC!!!

Seriously, this place has one of the best burgers in Arcadia. The Ivan is a classic - tasty and juicy. I always get the avocado for the extra \"yum\" factor. The Hangover is also amazing. It has saved me many Saturday mornings! The egg and bacon is cooked to perfection.

You may think the food is my favorite part of the Attic Ale House. Wrong! You need to see this beer list to believe it. They have all the local favorites, but also rotating crafts from all over the country. The list changes daily and there is always something for everyone.

I will definitely be back. The patio is too good to resist!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully located spot. I ordered the Ivan and am looking forward to it, but I really can't wait until I get a chance to experience that patio!!"}
{"text":"Wowzers, now this is an awesome gastropub. No ifs ands or buts about it, they have probably the best burger I have ever tasted here, ready for your enjoyment...

~Fud/Drink~
\"The Burger\", as they call it on their menu, is one of the best burgers in the world...its ranked. Yep, I know. I am not a big burger person, especially in the latter part of my young life. I am much more content with a fish or chicken dish than a greasy burger. But I must say I will gladly cross the line drawn in the sand for this burger. Upon picking up an already half eaten burger, I immediately noticed the weight and density. I was floored. It is impressively heavy, packed with yummy mixed greens, shaved red onion and the choice cheese tonight being provolone. The chipotle mayo is sublime, mixing the beef together along with the pretzel bun. Overall, this definitely constitutes the afformentioned ranking...its damn good.

Plus we enjoyed the burger and beer $10 special which they offer Wednesdays. The entire tab including my lone beer I ordered on the side would have come out to over $28, however the special shaved off $2 from the burger and an additional $6+  on our bill....IMPRESSIVE! This deal is on par with other nightly specials in the area... I fail to mention the fact that the beer selection is very good, they offer enough lighter varieties for me to try, but they offer something for every beer drinker.

~Atmosphere/Service~
Inside it may seem a bit cramped, but its not...the layout is quaint and you are surrounded by fun sings and album covers of indy bands. They have a few TV's with sports on, and the patio also provides a couple TV's as well. It is darker inside than a normal food spot, which lends to The Attics trademark chill vibe. Waitress was average in speed of service, nothing to write home about. I had no real questions to ask...next time I will pick their brains more. Awesome hangout bar, really relaxed atmosphere, once again.

~Extras/Rating~
Wednesday...$10...Beer....Burger....Special... JUST DO IT!

They get 5 stars. Why? Well, they have an amazing selection of crafts, an intimate setting and atmosphere, insanely tasty food, and heck, the best burger-beer deal in town..I mean, its the best burger and some of the best beer...IN TOWN, lol! Its a no-brainer. Bank it! Shoo-wop!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the Thursday pizza special. 
Went in last night and was only planning on a beer but was then introduced to the daily special : 
Any glass of wine or beer with any pizza for $12. 
Considering specialty beers can range from $5-$9 and pizzas from around $10-$16 this deal doesn't get any better! 
I'm now won over for Wednesdays AND Thursdays! Be back soon!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here after a night at the Wandering Tortoise & absolutely loved it here! Everyone enjoyed their drinks, they provide blankets to keep you warm on the patio & the food was bomb. My husband has been searching for a place with great wings & he feels confident he's found it here! He ordered the Santa Fe dry rub & Louisiana Style BBQ & he loved them both. I ordered the Margherita Pizza & it's one of the best I've ever had. My other favorite Margherita pizza place is LGO & I still like their sourdough crust the best, but the toppings on the pizza here blow LGO out of the water in my opinion. Everything was super fresh & flavorful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Complimentary valet makes parking easy, walk up stairs to a fun design looking towards camelback mountain. They have a good happy hour so take advantage and a large selection of great beer that I didn't expect. Ordered a meat plate and it was so-so. A little boring but a good deal for 11$. Saw a guy go after their big challenge burger, something like 7 .5pound parties and a ton of bacon and cheese and fixins. It was impressive for only 50$. Not sure he finished it."}
{"text":"Cool little hideaway.  The room is shaped like a long rectangle and it's situated upstairs in a two-story building.  It's not too big to make you feel lost nor too small to make you feel like you're suffocating.  Upon entering, you immediately feel like you've entered a hideout...maybe that's just me.  The place just feels like it's tucked away in a wide open space. It's different. Their patio has a fireplace and it feels quaint.  Sheryl, the waitress, makes eating there feel like you're at your friend's kitchen table.  If you are not big on burgers, like me, they have their pizzas.  The appetizer menu is limited. But oh the beer list is worth going there just for that."}
{"text":"Food and service fresh and tasty. Great to place to watch the game and view of camelback mountain."}
{"text":"I've gone here on 2 separate occasions and absolutely love their food. Last time I tried the burger called The Farm and have to say that it's probably the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really cool looking place. I enjoyed the various beer pulls hanging along the wall and the outdoor seating it's classy with a fireplace and has an incredible view of Camelsback mountain.  However, that was the extent of this experience. 

I had the \"Hangover\" burger and the \"Santa Fe\" wings. The burger I enjoyed the bun and although the burger was decent, I've definitely have had better and their fries are served well done, brown? For $14 and this highly reviewed/recommended place, I was expecting a WOW for my tastebuds, but that didn't happen.  The wings were on HH special six for only $3, great deal and I did like the wings to have them again.

I'm wondering if during our visit with a party of 4 and other customers filling in, more servers would be ideal. It was took a long time for service including not getting any refills of water or other beverages, food came out slowly and my burger didn't come out with the other couple with us. Our waitress said , \"we don't know what happened, it was put on the ticket and entered into the computer, but didn't come up? No apology but said we're making it right now.\" Okay, no biggie.  We were enjoying our company and stay.  I ended up getting refills for our table of waters and sodas for myself and my friend at the bar next to our table. I didn't think anything was wrong with this, since I thought I was helping out our waitress since she hadn't come around and we were out of drinks throughout our stay, but the second time I did this our waitress was clearly not happy I did this and made a comment directly at me on what I was doing, I answered I'm getting us our refills and smiled. Talk about Awkward. 

Should I give our service the benefit of the doubt? I don't know, I might try them out again socially with friends but I know there's a lot of other places to try and recently many of us dined elsewhere and the burger quality of the beef was great. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The Attic Ale House is great. The food is good. The beers are good. The service is great. Everyone that works there is awesome. They have a great Happy Hour. And their burger special on Wednesday and Pizza special on Thursday are a must go to event. The view from the patio is the best in Arcadia. See attached photo. My only complaints are 2. One...I get the awesome rotating beer selections but have a few popular staples that never change. Sucks to find a favorite and it's gone next time you visit. Two...don't let \"friends\" hang out and dominate the scene every damn day. Allow good paying guests to enjoy the atmosphere without your \"buddies\" bringing in outside beer and homemade lemonchello to show off. Save that for private. This is a business first. That s@$& will bring down a business. Trust me. I've seen it happen. An episode of Bar Rescue was devoted to it. Otherwise good place."}
{"text":"Place sucks. Horrible service. Waited 45 minutes for six - yes, six - wings. Bartender was openly drunk, loudly cursing. Food not worth the price or wait. Can't believe people giving this place 5 stars. Get out more. Such a bad experience I signed up with Yelp to leave this review. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place has the best burger ever, wings are awesome, and an amazing selection beers.

One of my favorite spots in phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend, I had never been but have always wanted to go, I had driven by 100 times and seen a ton of people on the outdoor patio and I love a good burger, and this place supposedly has one of the best in the country...\"The Ivan\" $13.00...to say the least I was not impressed. I have had better burgers at pretty much every other place around here, OHSO, Delux, Christ even the Chicago hamburger company down the streets sliders tasted better as far as I am concerned. Myself and my gf came on a Sunday afternoon, as I was walking up the stairs I stepped in a huge piece of fresh gum, obviously some uncultured swine that had just frequented the place must of spit this out, to say the least it was pretty gross, it took a minute to scrape off the bottom of my shoe, and was not the best start to my experience...we walked in and the bar was moderately busy... and all the tables were taken, I am not sure if there is suppose to be a hostess, there was no one around so we decided to seat our selves on the patio, to what seemed to be dismay of our server. She was horrible. Dulce. Poor attitude and not very friendly. Had to get up to ask for drink refills, also seemed like there was a huge issue with asking to turn the misters on outside, they turned them on and then a few minutes later turned them off, where I had to ask to turn them back on again it was just over 100 outside.  It took forever for our food to come out. On appearance alone the Ivan which probably stands close to 6 inches high looks pretty impressive, but taste wise...I was really not impressed. My Gf had the same thing...she too was not impressed, and she did not finish hers. The fries were mediocre...and as I said in general so was this experience here. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Very interesting place.  Patio and inside seating transition through open space.  Nice craft beer list.  Bruscetta was excellent and the Ivan..... oh the Ivan.  I would be back for that alone."}
{"text":"The best burger in Phoenix! Try the Ivan, it's a big Sandwich though! So my friends who can't eat much, I advised them to eat half and take the other half to go, it comes on a pretzel bun and fries! Wings are super good too ;) great beer on tap, great atmosphere and amazing services!"}
{"text":"Good view, friendly servers. But food and service was just ok at best. We asked for ranch with the burger but it came out after we were finished and with a bug in it (no apologies). Also they were terrible at refilling drinks. Skip the pretzels, but the wings are good. This place has great potential but the dining experience left us super disappointed. Despite going during happy hour and splitting two apps and one entree, our bill was still $40 total so not a great value (we didn't get any beers either)."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time coming to the Attic Ale House and I must say they have one gosh dang good burger. The Ivan burger is super simple but their beef is very flavorful and they cook it just right so it's nice and juicy! Pretzel bun is really good too! Their hot wings are also really flavorful too, a lot of meat and a good buffalo sauce. They have an extensive list of draft beers too. This is a really cool place to come and check out when in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place in the evening. The Attic is kind of a cool comfortable looking place from street level. (Indian School Road). 
There are plenty of great places to hang out at in that neighborhood. I expected this place to be on par with the rest of them.
I was not happy with my experience there. I couldn't tell the help from the customers.
No one was in any kind of uniform at all..
The crowd seemed very college like (young and immature) the staff seemed the same way.
Great for a very very young crowd, but not my cup of Vodka martini.
You can keep this place.
The food was not worth the money either, I tossed half of it in the trash when the busboy came by to collect our plates.
I will not be going back to this place unless they bring it up several notches."}
{"text":"I went here last night and it was a nice little spot to go to. I will definitely be going again. I had a few slices of their Two Brothers Pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni on the pizza were nice and crisp and had good flavor to them. The cheese wasn't bad. The edges of the pizza were nice and crisp which I liked, however where this dish fell short was the crust. Aside from the crust edges, the crust was doughy, soft, limp and had no texture that it should have because that's the point of the pizza crust. I wouldn't order pizza from here again. I then had half of The famous Ivan burger. On the menu it stated the Ivan was one of the top 5 burgers in the world. I beg to differ. The Ivan has to be the best burger on this planet! The meat was juicy and flavor exploded in your mouth with each bite of just the meat by itself, not to mention the amazing fixings they put on the burger, and the bun was phenomenal. I would have given two stars based off of the pizza but I had to bump my review up to 4 stars after that burger."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out especially to sit outside on the balcony.  Beer selection is great. Great food menu selection. We had the burger and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese portion is very large."}
{"text":"Ivan burger and a beer for 10 bucks on a Wednesday feels like stealing... Its amazing!"}
{"text":"Wrote a bad review previously, but went a few more times, this place definetly improved a lot =)

The wait time is still excessive, went back last week even and like I expected it always took like 30 to 45 minutes to pay for my meal, it's always been like that though so you kinda have to expect to spend a lot of time here when you come.

The food is delicious and so is the selection of beer sooooo I guess it's all kinda worth it."}
{"text":"This is not a 4 or 5 star restaurant.  Four of us went tonight for $10 burger and beer special.  I had been once when it was Caves and Ives and the elements that contributed to its demise are still present: super-loud atmosphere and staffing that is not adequate to give top-notch service.  For a restaurant that was supposed to be out of business, they should take the name off of the side of the building, and don't run the credit cards with the old name on the receipt.

So the good things: 21 beers on tap with a good national selection; as a supporter of locally-crafted beer, I wish they would feature some of the excellent AZ beer being made.  The burger was huge and would easily feed 2 pretty hungry people.  But my medium-well burger was cooked more than the other burgers that were ordered medium, and the \"no mayo\" part of the order was missed on one.

As near as I could tell, there were only 2 waitresses and the bartender (no hostess) waiting on the whole restaurant. And they were literally running back and forth, so while I appreciate their efforts, it's poor form for a well-run restaurant. 

The noise level was truly deafening and the vibrations from the air handler on the other side of the wall next to our table were bad enough that I will not be visiting again, but if you don't care about communicating with the folks across the table, go enjoy a potentially great burger and a beer for only $10 on Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Went back for happy hour only to find it not open until 4, big disappointment.  I couldn't tell because there were people drinking in there and it was apparently bring your own on the patio, a six pack of Heineken was the special of the day. Place was dirty and unfriendly, won't be going back, to many other places to go. That's too bad because the Holmburger was really good! What a Sh*thole this place has turned into!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try something different, so after a Google search of best burgers in Phoenix, this place showed up. They do not appear to have a website.
We thought we'd give it a try and our first problem was parking. It's 'complimentary' valet, unless you want to park on the opposite side of Indian School and Jay-walk across traffic. I didn't have any cash on me, so this put me immediately in an awkward position. I asked the valet if there were any ATMs inside and he recommended I download an app for my smartphone to pay him. I explained that my wife and I both have flip phones, so app downloading is not an option. He suggested I ask for some cash back at the end of my meal. I told him I would try it.

Next, we went up the stairs that leads to a tinted glass door with no writing on it. Would it kill them to stencil THE ATTIC on the door? We could see the restaurant through the windows alongside the top, but we were not certain the 'blank' door led to the entrance of it or some other business that might be upstairs. We walked back down the stairs and a bit further along the building only to realize those are the ONLY stairs, so back up the stairs we went for the second time.

When we walked in, a sign said to seat yourself and I could not find any employees anywhere. So we grabbed a table. Outside looked nice, but not when it's 110 degrees outside! Soon after we were greeted by a young man who poured us some water and said our waitress would be with us soon. That's when I realized the employees apparently wear whatever they want, t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, etc... This makes them completely indistinguishable from the guests!

While waiting, I counted 6 flat screen TVs showing football, grey paint on the walls, and the noise. Yes, it gets very loud in there in such a narrow, long space with people talking. I SAID IT GETS REALLY LOUD IN THERE AND MAKES IT HARD TO TALK TO THE PERSON YOU'RE DINING WITH ACROSS THE TABLE!

It's clear many of the guests dining here really love it, so the whole place has this great energy to it. Still, a $12 burger? A $14 burger? That's a lot of money for just a burger. Everything I read online and at Phoenix New Times was that their IvanBurger was to die for. My wife ordered it without the bun (lettuce wrap instead). Its a pretzel bun, which I think is a poor choice. They were also offering potato skins for $6, but you only got two. Two potato skins? Who does that? Most places bring you an app plate with 6-8 skins for the same price. So I didn't order that. Instead, I thought I would try the cheese pizza, since I read their pizza was good, too.

As we placed our order with our waitress, I asked if they had Coke or Pepsi? She said they had RC cola. Whoa! RC cola? Kalil drinks, like they serve at Arby's? Yes. So I ordered a beer instead. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I ordered the Hawaiian 'Maul' which was a pretty good beer, but again, I'd be happy with a Bud Light - I'm just not into beer.

 My wife order The Ivan with small salad ($12) and my cheese pizza ($10) and beer ($5.50) and just water for the wife. The Cave & Ives total was $27.50 +  $2.29 tax.

The pizza was cooked perfectly on the top, and barely at all on the bottom. The dough and cheese were very fresh, but the sauce tasted like its main ingredient was sugar. That's fine if you're dining at Peter Piper or Chuck E Cheese, but I expected something more 'adult.'

And that, therein, is my problem with this place. I think if I was in my 20's or 30's I'd want to dine at a hipster place that's hard to find the entrance, see my peers working without any uniform and watch the game while drinking microbrews. But at 47 years old, I can't and do not want to eat a burger that's over 10\" tall, with bacon and cheese and a pretzel bun. I just want a good burger on a whole wheat bun without the cheese or the bacon. Let the meat speak for itself rather than drown it with all the condiments. A restaurant called Charr offers it numerous ways, to serve all kinds of customers. I don't think most people over the age of 45 are in the demographic of who The Attic is trying to appeal to.

With all the condiments pushed to the side of her plate, my wife ate her lettuce-wrap burger and was very pleased with how it tasted and she was very pleased with the location and the atmosphere and the prices. Overall, though, she'd like to try coming back when the whether is cooler and we can sit out on the balcony and try some different menu items. The pretzel sounds amazing, but I was afraid if I ordered it, I would have no room left for dinner. Maybe next time.

Every one of the staff were very friendly. The menu is EXTREMELY limited and the prices are, in my opinion, about $4 too high for the burgers.

I explained the valet situation and the waitress did permit me to add an extra $2 to her tip, and she gave me that $2 cash back, which I then handed to the valet (also very courteous and professional) as they retrieved our car."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday with one of my friends, she got the pizza and I got the trio tacos, the shrimp, fish and chicken. Not to bad at all, really good and filled me up, pizza was super good, and wine was 1/2 off Tuesday's and the tacos were $3 each and special was $2 off so $7 I was full
Oh and the sweet stout was the best!! So damn Good!! Our waiter, he was super cool and informative!! 
They have a hamburger challenge there, if you finish your 7patties and 7 slices of cheese, along with pickles, without going to the bathroom, or spewing it out, it's yours free and you get to name your own burger and this burger is $50 smackaroos!! Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Of 2013... And to top it off, I was there for their Wednesday $10 burger & beer special.  What a pleasant surprise.  You know, we eat every day.  And most days we really don't think twice about it.  But on this day, repeatedly, I had to set the burger down, and just let my taste buds thank me for such a glorious meal.  The fries, in my humble Idahoan opinion, were cut fresh and seasoned perfectly, the patty was the perfect size and the pretzel bun was maybe the best I've ever had.

Add to that a couple pints of my first Jewish IPA (HeBrew Hop Manna IPA - it was Hasiderific!) and I was completely content.  This was my 1st venture to this area of Phoenix, and I found out there's a bar across the street called The Little Woody?  Sold.  I will be back, and it will most certainly be on a Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer choices, and a great atmosphere. 

The view on this place is killer and I absolutely love sitting out on the patio when it is cooler out. I have had the pizza here, the hangover burger, the pretzel, and the wings and they have all been spectacular. For my beer drinkers, you'll love the selections on the list and they are so much more than your different pale ale options, they have some really interesting beers on tap! I had a plum beer and a chocolate stout beer and both were outstanding.

Katie should be your go-to if you want good service and a chick with knowledge on brews. My friend also asked her for a \"smooth\" wine and Katie hooked her up with one and she loved it. 

I'd suggest to take full advantage of the patio if the weather permits and enjoy the view. This place is great!"}
{"text":"There is nothing that can be said about this place that hasn't already been said. Great food, great beer, and great customer service. Burgers are the best in town hands down."}
{"text":"Half a star for the food. 4 stars for the beers. The patio is nice and offers a nice view but honestly I will never eat there again. We left all of our dishes half full. I would grab a beer there though because they have some rare stuff usually on tap. Went there during football season and was watching a game and cheering for my squad but the bartender and his boys were talking so much crap about my team that it wasn't even worth responding to. Paid my tab and left their nasty half eaten food on the table. Ice Cold wings? Nah, I'm good."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good. The food looked good, but I just had a beer. Play some music! It's annoying having to listen to all the drunk loud old ladys cackle. At least drown them out with background noise. And I waited a real long time to get a beer, even though there is plenty of staff available. They all stand around and hang out and walk around wondering."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it was Cave and Ives and I FINALLY made it there the other night. I REALLY enjoyed the place. It's got a REALLY great atmosphere with a nice patio and a fun, cheerful crowd.  They have a good selection of craft beers on tap, as well as wine and cocktails. I had their Ivan burger which was delicious, but HUGE.

Beyond that, I had downed beers the rest of the night and had a good time. I must say that I wasn't overly crazy about the service. The bartender while reasonably efficient and polite wasn't the warmest or friendliest. It was pretty busy so I definitely take that into account but her attitude was noticeably contrary to the overall warmth and cheer of the place and the patrons which was disappointing.

I am still down to come again because this is a fun place and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had.  Period.  The only negative thing was the person behind the bar changed the station when the song  \"It Wasn't Me\" came on.  lol  Love that song!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, friendly, yummy, simple, fabulous. I had a frosty glass of the Blueberry Pale Ale and a (Yum) Hangover Burger with a side salad (some yogurt dressing on top). And the view......uh, the view is 'awesome'. If you like a good craft brew and a crazy good burger this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"My husband has had this joint on his \"must check out\" list for a while, so we made a Wednesday evening drop in. I don't think we could've picked a better night because every Wednesday is host to the Ivan burger special! Lucky patrons will get one Ivan burger and one craft draft for 10 bucks. Yes, you read that right friends.
Maybe you'd be more impressed if you knew just how delicious that Ivan burger is, on a pretzel bun with all of the right fixings and chipotle mayo for a little kick. It truly earns it's distinction as one of the top five all-time burgers (so sayeth the menu).
And when I say craft draft, I mean it! These guys have a great and varied rotating selection. And if you want something outside of what they currently have tapped and perhaps something more difficult to come by, feel free to buy a bottle or two from the coolers up front to try with that burger instead.
Overall great food and great service at the bar. Definitely prepare yourself for a wait if you are into eating earlier. This place is a bit small and is busy as a happening happy hour spot. I'll be back again in the fall (if not sooner) to take in a brew and the view when the outdoor patio space is once again open."}
{"text":"If you like craft beer and better than average bar food then this place is perfect!

It's on the second level of the building and you can see Camelback Mountain from the bar and front patio.

The service is great and all the employees really know about craft beer.  I had a Racer X IPA that I had never tried before and it was wonderful.  I also had a rich and creamy Avery Czar Imperial Stout that was awesome.

The Ivan burger is as good as the hype.  They also double fry their french fries to make them extra crispy the way I like them!

The Attic really does a great job and I can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Was heading towards another restaurant when this place caught our eye. We decided to check it out, and I'm so glad we did! The rooftop made for the perfect bar vibe. My friend and I shared the Hangover burger and OMG it was delicious. Paired with a couple of beers and we had ourselves a great Sunday lunch. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place great patio and inside seating. Always great food and service. Recently had a birthday dinner there. I first made reservations for 8 but ended up being 12 they had no problem accommodating our party. I do have to say one of the best burgers in town not to mention great selection in beers too! I am so glad I stumbled on this outstanding place."}
{"text":"Incredible! If you love burgers and beer this is the place for you! 

I tried the Holmburger medium rare...juicy and full of  jalapenos and siracha pancetta that brought the flavor up a notch!

Along with that I had the Strawberry Milk Jug Porter
...very tasty!

Cheryl our server was friendly, spunky and super-accommodating...such a terrific gal!"}
{"text":"Hours on the yelp site say they are open on Sundays, drove all the way there just to see its closed. I'm pissed"}
{"text":"My burger was fantastic and the beer was better!! I went with the waitresses suggestion and really enjoyed the beer! Great ambiance , love all the taps hanging on the walls."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The grass fed burgers are excellent. Great beer list. Wait staff very friendly. Nice view of mountains from bar. Very nice patio"}
{"text":"The Attic has really great burgers; their happy hour is awesome, and I really love eating their fries with the chipotle mayo they have! I actually get sad if I'm in Phoenix and forget to eat here. One of my favorites for sure!

One time we got there and there was a waiting list (written on a chalkboard), after putting our name at the bottom and a few people were seated, some guy walks in and writes his name down at the top thinking he's outsmarted the system and will be seated with his friends who have yet to show up before everyone else. I politely mentioned it to the hostess, and she told me she saw him do that in the past. I told her where his name should have been placed given the 10+ groups that were actually before him; and she kindly noted it. Really lovely hostess, she's been great many times in the past as well; shes one of those people that actually cares about her job.

Either way, great establishment, and I will certainly visit and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge burger fan.  After hearing these guys had one of the top 5 burgers in the country, I had to give it a try.  Really a fantastic experience...and absolutely the BEST burger I've ever had.  The pretzel bun is just great.  Most places with a good burger use the bun as the thing to hold the meat; The Attic's pretzel bun is so delicious you could eat it by itself.

We went on a Wednesday and I got to try a rare Sierra Nevada firkin IPA...just delicious.  Great craft beer selection, excellent food.  You might have to wait, but--trust me--it's worth it."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and split the Ivan Burger and the Bruschetta. Both dishes were solid. The burger was cooked median rare as ordered and was very tasty. I really enjoyed the Bruschetta maybe more that the burger since it has Brie cheese on it along with a pesto aioli and a distinct sweat/slightly spicy additional aioli. Service was friendly and attentive. Great spot on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! A few of us stopped in for some drinks and food after a nearby yelp event. The restaurant is located upstairs on the 2nd floor and has both inside and outdoor seating. The outside patio is big with an outside bar, tvs, couches and tables. Some of the seating is right on edge so you can overlook from the balcony which is really cool. 

The staff was awesome!!!! We had a lot of fun talking with them and the service was great.

We sat outside in one of the lounge couches and relaxed while enjoying some wine and appetizers. We ordered the bruschetta, caprese, dry rub wings, and pretzel. All of it was super good and filling between the 3 of us. The bruschetta was desert like and delicious. I also loved the pretzel dipped in the cheese sauce.

Overall everything was super good and I'm looking forward to coming back! I highly recommend. Would be a great place for happy hour or to watch a sports game!"}
{"text":"Burger Wednesdays are the best! They have great burgers and cold beer. Their staff are very friendly and on it! Plus a mountain view. What's not to like?!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this week. Jeff wanted to check it out for a possible Sunday UYE meet up. He knows how much I love burgers so he took me on Wednesday for the burger and a beer special. I was almost going to stay home because I was exhausted but I am glad I went. It is a small space but cute at the same time. While I was looking at the menu I saw that their burgers were in the top10 in the world. That got me excited to try it. The beer selection was very different because they were beers that are not as popular to the area but I found one that was really good.
Then... my burger came out. Holy cow, literally! It came out in a pretzel bun with fries. I had to strategize how I was going to eat it because it was so big. Once I took my first bite, I was in heaven. Burgers are one of my favorites so you can imagine that I was enjoying every bite. It just melted in my mouth. I am making my mouth water right now just writing about it. Anyway, great place and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great little nugget in PHX.  I had the happy hour special: burger and a beer for $10.00.  Premium ingredients and who doesn't love a good pretzel bun?  The french fries were really extra crunchy.  I'm not sure which beer I had, I just asked for a light on tap but I really liked it.  Great little patio outside, will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place has a friendly crowd of craft beer drinkers and a great rotating selection of craft brew.  The burgers are great too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday afternoon. The beer selection was pretty good and the burgers were great. I had a the Holmberg which was excellent. The burger featured a 1/2 lb patty with Jalapenos, Sriracha and pancetta. There was really nice sweet sauce too. The Burger was a little messy but it was good. The view of camelback mountain while watching some football was nice too. The wait staff was quick and helpful. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Meet up with some fellow yelpers for a HH UYE, the place picked was the Attic. What a fun little place this is.

We meet up on a Wed night, mostly because they have a wed night special of a burger & beer for 10 bucks! Man that's a great deal! 

I'm not really a beer drinker, but overheard a fellow Yelper say that Stouts are like a coffee base/flavored, I like coffee, so this might work, I saw the #6 was a Bells Cherry Stout, and that's the one I picked.  I enjoyed the stout, it didn't taste the same as a normal beer and it has a heavy body to it. I liked it. It went well with my burger too.

The burger in this beer & burger deal for 10 bucks is the Ivan. Let me tell you, Ivan is beefy, juicy and messy, just the way I like it.  It's on a pretzel bun, has lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo, cheese and bacon if you like. I ordered mine medium rare, and it was oooohhhhh ssssooooo goooood!! 

The only downside for this evening was the fries, this was my 3rd stop for a burger in a just a matter of a couple of weeks and I again run into SHOESTRING FRIES!!! Come on PHOENIX, these are not real fries!! But these were worst then shoestrings; they were the mini shoestring, the half pints of the crew!! Now I am an Irish girl and love me some spuds, so you betcha those half pint mini shoestring fries were eaten up!

Other than the shoestring fries, everything else was a perfect, The Attic is a great find and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Still by far my favorite burger spot hands down.

But be warned, make sure you check your tab before you leave. My boyfriend and I had come in with a couple of our close friends to show them how truly amazing these burgers are.  3 of us had ordered the special burger of the night \"da bears\" which I wish they would keep on the menu. But anyways when we all had ordered the beer that you could get without getting charged extr (they have little peppermint patties) next to them I feel like is a waste of ink on their menus since the waitress charged us full price for the beers and just subtracted 3 dollars from each when we did not order the other beers on purpose because we wanted the 12-14 dollar deal that comes with a burger and beer for the above listed price that you are told won't change if you get the appropriate (peppermint patty dotted) beers. 

With that being said I'm not sure how often my boyfriend and I will be back since we are not a huge fan of places changing their prices and not being a good deal. I guess good things can never last right?"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Cave & Ives, which is very missed! The gentleman who owned it previously did however make a wise choice to sell it to another gentleman who knows restaurant biz as well. The Attic is a very delicious burger joint. They have the world's famous burgers and were appointed as one of the top burger joints in the United States. Which to my liking, they were excellent. You have to definitely try this place if you are a burger girl like me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here.  Sat outside at the bar overlooking the mountain. Super cool spot.

Our server was great and really accommodating. We had one of their burgers and split it cuz it was huge. I wanted spicy; he didn't, so I ordered the chipotle mayo and sriracha pancetta on the side. No problems there. A great burger done perfectly (ordered medium for medium rare-ish) The bun was a pretzel bun, fresh and tasty and kept together well on the enormous burger with fixins. 

The boys had the Holmburgers and wings and loved them too!  All went really well with the Dragoon Stronghold pints."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. They make their own gluten free pizza dough. Best that I have ever had! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of craft beers, on draft as, as well as an impressive collection of specialty bottles! Ryan, their beer pro, is knowledgable, and remembers what we typically like to drink, so recommendations are on point, and always let's us try new beers! Can't complain about the view of Camelback either. They offer events weekly, such as special tappings/brewery events/dinners... so always something interesting to taste. A couple TVs if you're looking to watch a game. Good vibe, wether you'd like to socialize with your own friends and not be bothered, or meet new people. Highlights for me include the burgers (and I'm not even a big burger fan), and the bruschetta (amazing unique sauce). Unique space on a second story, great view, good food, awesome specialty beer selection, friendly perople who remember your name (or at least your drink)...what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love the attic for their fish tacos! I have no idea what they put in them but they are seriously addicting I had 4 of them and a spinach salad one time and they seriously had to cut me off! The spinach salad there is amazing too! It is a must try along with all the beers simply delicious and a great way to enjoy inside or outside."}
{"text":"So I have been itching to go here for awhile and now can't wait to go back when's cooler so we can enjoy the awesome patio. We went on Father's Day for the special and were not disappointed. The food was exceptional and the beer selection was unique. Small place but with the room they have it's utilized very well and it is very unique inside. Very much recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The hamburgers were so spectacular you can eat them alone and be filled up. The choice of beer was overwhelming but I was able to settle for watermelon flavored beer that went great with the burger. The outdoor ambiance made the great date with my husband well worth the money spent!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last Thursday.  The place is a little hard to find but that's not a big deal to me.  The meat and cheese plate was amazing.  My friend and I also split a burger with fries and a pizza.  She has a hollow leg, I swear.  Anyway, the food was great and everyone was really friendly.  Aside from the meat and cheese plate (to die for) I think the fries were my fave...super golden and crunchy on the outside...thin but not shoe-string...and I don't even like fries that much.  So there you have it!"}
{"text":"Great space.  Great beer.  Great food.  Bartender rarely smiled... maybe had a rough morning.  Sat at the bar for quick service, didn't get it.  Will give it a 2nd try though."}
{"text":"16 bucks for a 99 cent pizza :(.   Way over priced. We would not go back. Service was very slow and food was over priced. We did like the wings. The pizza was horrible and way over priced."}
{"text":"Fellow elite Lorraine F. and I were in search of bar to watch game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals. She suggested this place and I willingly agreed since I live in the area. Since it was a Wednesday, they have a special for their burgers and beers. I decided to order the hangover burger which comes with an over easy egg. I was pleased with my selection because the burger had quality ingredients such as a pretzel bun. \"The bite\" for this burger was rather large but I was able to make it happen, lol. I absolutely love their fries because they remind me of pommees frites. I loved them so much I almost wanted to ask for another order, but stopped myself because I was extremely full. Overall, this is a good place to hang out or watch sports. I will definitely be back and check out the outside patio area since it over looks Camelback Mtn."}
{"text":"Nice local pub. Good draft beer selection. Friendly and comfortable atmosphere. Met some very friendly regulars at the bar. The \"Ivan Burger\" is is a very good burger. I think its a great happy hour bar. Variety of weekly specials."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers on the planet, great views of Camelback Mountain, friendly service, and sold out with a waiting list craft beer eventsffrom only the best breweries on the planet."}
{"text":"The Homburger is freaking amazing! Perfect mix of spicy & sweet. Also they have awesome assortment of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Pass by all the time but first time going in. Glad I did. Wait staff was super friendly and welcoming. Didn't catch their names but the brunette server and server with black hair were super nice and fun to talk to. Had the chicken sliders, which were amazing. Then had the best most delicious cheesecake I've ever had. Definitely would go here again and suggest it to others."}
{"text":"Visited the Attic because of the reviews I read on Yelp. I was visiting from LA for spring training and found this bar. We tried there famous pretzel hamburger and it was just like the reviews said, it was amazing.

The beer selection was great and the staff was very friendly, she recommended a beer that tasted like pumpkin pie... It did and was also amazing.. This will be a place that I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If your a craft beer lover like myself, then your missing out if you have not given this place a go! You can also ask for suggested pairing with their great food menu offering something different each week. The staff and gm are also very knowledgeable about the food/beer menu.. Try to catch a sunset with their perfect view of camelback mountain patio seating."}
{"text":"Stopped by The Attic for KBS Burger night, the sequel, last night.
Best burger I've had in Phoenix! And the KBS didn't hurt either!
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"What's the best reward after a tough Sunday hike? Obviously a burger and beer. 

   When we tried to find The Attic, we were lost. Four businesses....no \"The Attic\"....until we realized, the name was not just cute and memorable---it's the location. Going through the iron gates, we climbed the stairs and found this cool spot. It's not very big and that patio isn't being used due to work being done outside, but this place was full. 

     They offered a limited Sunday menu that boasted chicken wings and salads but most of all...The Ivan Burger. A massive amount of meat cooked to perfection, topped with the works (you can add Bacon and mushrooms as well) along with a chipotle mayo that got my tastebuds a goin'. If that doesn't make your mouth water the pretzel bun will. This burger is straightforward and a hunk of heaven. 

       Naturally I can't eat a burger without a brew to wash it down with. The Epic Sour Apple beer I picked was great. It had tangy, sour hints while not tasting too sweet like a cider. It was so good that the guy I was with liked it more than his more \"manly\" beer. I hold the title for fruit beer success. 

     All in all, I want to get back up to the Attic to see what they have in store on their regular menu, what a good hide away!!"}
{"text":"In some of my favorite shows of all time where there is a group of close friends who always have their go to spot to hang out, drink, and eat.  Although, I just went here for dinner with my boyfriend, that's the vibe I go from this place: somewhere friends and families can come together to relax and enjoy a meal and drinks. While being here I saw a variety of \"customer types\". There was a few guys on the outside patio watching a golf game and drinking some beers, there was a group of friends having dinner and drinks, and there was a family also having dinner. I really wish I would've tried a burger because I feel like that's what they're known for, but we got the Two Brothers pizza and the traditional buffalo wings. Neither of these disappointed. I don't know how to word this other than the pizza had the perfect thickness. It wasn't overly doughy to the point where all you taste is bread and it wasn't too than to the point the bread is brittle and breaks off easily before you bite into it. The wings were just for my boyfriend and he liked them. I'm the foodie in the relationship and he rarely has a significant opinion about restaurants, but at the end of our dinner he said \"I'd be open to coming back to this place.\"


We live right down the street and plan on coming back for random weekday date nights."}
{"text":"Very cool place. I've driven by this place many times and have also eaten at place next door, (Yacht House), finally a friend brought me here for their \"burger weds\" and man was I happy he did. 

So every Weds on top of their already amazing burgers they offer a special which is usually the one i'd suggest to get. Explosion of unique flavors such as Sriracha candied pancetta and something they call \"food crack sauce\" I've only been here twice and will most def be back. 

P.S. they have burgers available any night and many beer pairing to go along with the already good food."}
{"text":"I came to AZ for the weekend and wanted to try a brewery. Parking was kind of small and tight if you had a big car ( had a Range Rover ) . After we seated ourselves , it took forever just for someone to greet us and bring a menu .. other than that after  we received a menu and service, we ordered our drinks & food. Ordered 3 of the burgers on the menu , wings & meat platter .... amazinggggg!!!!!! I'll definitely be back when I'm in town ."}
{"text":"Good Burger, Better Vibe and Amazing Service! Wife and I stopped here to try out their burgers we had heard so much about and loved it. The waiter was extremely pleasant! Would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The Attic has great burgers.  It's a nice friendly place with a view that you can order a glass of wine or a beer and chat with friends.  Great patio.  The service can be hit-or-miss that's why the 3 stars, otherwise it would have been better.  Prices are reasonable, food and variety is good, lots of beers on tap.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The Attic is a great spot for a rare brew and a delicious burger. My fiance and I had a few of our first dates here, and later on we even said our first \"I love you\" in the parking lot! :)"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great, and I usually just go for the beer.. On Wednesdays the burger and beer for 10$ is awesome but the veggie sandwich is kinda  veggie patties would be great!"}
{"text":"I went here to meet some friends for Happy Hour and for their Wed burger deal. This place is awesome. The burger was talked up by my friend and I have some pretty high burger standards so the expectations were up there. It is easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. The fries were great as well. Just a great meal all around.

I only had one but it was a delicious Belgian that paired great w the burger. Was unfiltered but really smooth and pretty potent. The ambiance and service is very good. Would like to hang out on the patio next time and sit by the fireplace. I plan on coming back and introducing it to some friends.

As a bonus - it's right above my favorite deli spot Sacks."}
{"text":"We found this place on TapHunter a wonderful app for beer lovers. A great find! It was the day after Celebrate Belgium Independence Day and they were featuring Belgium beers on tap. Totally awesome. They apparently change featured beers  regularly so each trip should be a fun experience. We were also lucky to hit happy hour. $1.50 off on beer and very reasonably priced appetizers. Where can you find 3 types of chicken wings each  less than $5.  Plus you get a great view of nearby Camelback Mountain. Put this place on your wish list. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just stopped in after a long time of neglecting this place for years and always have had a good time here.  The bartender who was also our server was freaking PHENOMENAL!  The staff all around were great though.  She was helpful with her favorite picks and guiding our indecisive nature to a brew that would be in the neck of the woods of our palate.  The attic is definitely known for their burgers but we tried the Pizza since we were .  Sausage and Mushroom was the choice and it was pretty decent.  Thin crust that was a little flimsy but the dough was tasty, toppings good and cheese plenty.  I'm holding back that star for maybe a crispier crust next time.  If you're looking for a patio when the weather is better their patio is a great look at Camelback and for the sports goer they have plenty of TVs to keep your conversations minimal and your cheering at a maximum!"}
{"text":"Hidden GEM! My brother was visiting town so we decided to hunt this place down and have dinner. I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger!! melt in your mouth delish!! Its a cool spot  that is kinda hidden but worth the trip to Arcadia!"}
{"text":"So! Happy! We! Found! This! Place! 

First off, from the moment we walked into The Attic from our yelp event close by the staff was so awesome! They seated us outside on the patio which was beautiful! It wasn't crowded at all, and the noise level was perfect! 

We ordered wine, and several different appetizers! Let me start with, they were delicious!!! We had wings, a pretzel, bruschetta, and caprese! My favorite was definitely bruschetta (but if you were to ask my stomach it would argue that the wings were favorite), the flavor of the Brie was so good! I found one of my new favorite happy hour places! 

I also saw in the menu that they are known for their burgers,\" I WILL BE BACK \"(say it like you're Arnold in the terminator)! Hehehe. 

Honestly, what made this experience for me was not only how awesome the atmosphere and food were but how fabulous the staff was! They spoke with you on a personal level, they even took Brittany C.'s and I yelp tags and wore them around the bar! Classic. Thanks for such a great ending to our girls night out!"}
{"text":"Very cool place with great burgers and a big list of craft beer. Bartender, chef, and server were very nice. Very cool feel and look inside. I had the Super Bowl Special which was a burger with guacamole and tortilla strips, which I couldn't understand why it would work but it did."}
{"text":"Bar-hopping with friends, never a dull moment. Climbed the winding staircase to this treasure at the advice of a friend. restaurant is clean and wide open, patio overlooks Arcadia landscape and you're up high. Happy hour is indeed happy, $3 wings and many specials.

If you're a watery beer drinker, beware, this place serves craft brews and there are no baby beers on tap. We enjoyed several brews and perused the menu. The ambiance is, well, mixed. Some hipsters enjoying the days while right next to them were some more \"picky\" clientele. I won't say more. This is Arcadia, the locals are allowed in, pleasant or otherwise. 

We tried an order of wings in every flavor and their specialty of the day, an Italian sandwich featuring Salami, which was beyond our expectation. Hey, the bread was good. We like that. The Attic Wings were a not-too-sweet soy/honey mix that really hit the spot. The buffalo style, well, pass on these, they seemed to be thickened with flour to the point of the sauce sitting on there 1/2 inch thick.  My veggie friend had huge hot pretzel and enjoyed that.

The chef came out and spoke with us and he seemed really interested in our experience. 

Off happy hour pricing looks high. But hey, that's what Happy Hour is for."}
{"text":"For having such great reviews, I was very unimpressed by this place. I'm not sure what  they are going for here, possibly a fancy higher-end drink and eatery thing. I was expecting a great beer selection, and on that front, they very much do have great craft beer. However, I've never seen anyone charge as much for beer as this place does. They jack the prices WAY up, so much so that even happy hour pricing doesn't really make it worth going. I ordered the happy hour tacos and they were good, but not amazing or anything. So if you have a lot of money to throw around for expensive beers and even more expensive food; well then you can do so with a nice view from the balcony."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this pace is not good as far as the food - awful burgers!! Beer selection is good but that's it for this place! Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Burger special on Wednesdays is now not a special. Only certain types of beer and they raised the price. They also can't seem to cook a burger medium rare.  Last week I got a medium well twice. The new \"manager\" said it was because it had to come up the dumbwaiter from downstairs and it keeps cooking.  He also said I wouldn't have to pay for the replacement. How kind... I won't be back and we had been regulars for at least 4 years."}
{"text":"I'll have to give this place another try. We went on a busy Friday night and were seated at a table right by the entrance, kitchen, and drink station. Environment is one of the most important things to me in a restaurant and it was less than enjoyable. Our server was very attentive and I enjoyed the mead I ordered. My husband got a burger and I got fish tacos. The tacos were okay - fresh but not very flavorful. My husband loved his burger, it was nice and juicy. I think we missed out on ambiance of this place as I didn't even see what the whole restaurant and deck looked like because we were right next to the entrance. Honestly they shouldn't even have a table there as I don't know who would enjoy that spot."}
{"text":"Cute place with a good atmosphere. Not the best or worst burgers I've had,  but pretty good, and I did LOVE the fries that came with it! Although the meats on the meat platter appetizer were tasty, I was expecting a little bit more for $11. Most of the meats were very similar, and there were only two types of cheese, neither of which were that great. I would go back to get a drink and try a different appetizer....but wouldn't be my first choice for a burger. With that said, I did like the place, staff was friendly and food was good, just nothing special."}
{"text":"A friend told me I needed to come and check this place out as it was one of the best burgers she had ever had. She was not wrong! I ordered The Ivan with cheddar and bacon, and it was delicious! Not only was the food fantastic, they had a great selection of draughts, and the service was equally great. Our server was attentive and entertaining and overall made for a really enjoyable experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"came here to get the Ivan burger and did just that.  It was pretty good but the pretzel bun overpowered it. i usually like pretzel buns though but it was good, when we go back ill try some other burgers. fries are great also and service."}
{"text":"I just got back from a small birthday celebration at The Attic, which was my first trip there, and one with high expectations. I am pleased to report my expectations were met, and exceeded, in every aspect from the diversity of craft beer on tap, to the quality of food, to the manner of service.

Cheryl was our waitress, and I couldn't be more happy with her service; she was friendly and responsive to our table of 8, including having amazing beer floats made for us, in order to celebrate my birthday, which were *not* menu items!

The Ivan was a fantastic burger: large, and delicious. If you are a fan of sours you may be interested to know they had both New Belgium's La Folie and Anderson Valley's Blood Orange Gose on tap, two of my favorites!

I'd strongly suggest going with one of the burgers, instead of the pizza. A couple of people in my party ordered pizza, which they said was average, while everyone else who ordered a burger thought it was way above average."}
{"text":"fanTASTIC cannot wait to go again. I totally forget what we ordered but here's my best guess:

-Bruschetta. Ridiculous. So good, had some kind of spicy chili oil.
-Some kind of grilled veggie sandwich, with grilled eggplant and we added chicken to it. I literally don't think I've ever had something so good.
-Hangover burger, with overeasy egg inside. GOD so good. 

Our waitress was frickin awesome and knew a ton about the menu and beer selection. Props, Attic, see you again soon."}
{"text":"The Attic is a pretty sweet spot to go to for wings, burgers and beers.  They have a nice sized menu of unique beers (that changes often), and overall the food quality is much better than your average sports bar. Specialty burgers, pizzas and appetizers....most everything is A+.  I personally love their dry rubbed Cajun wings with the chipotle dipping sauce.  It's de-lish!

The only reason this place doesn't get a 5-star rating is because the staff here rarely smiles.  And I mean RARELY!!  Sometimes they're friendly-ish, but most of the time they just seem sapped of any sort of enthusiasm, so service drags. If the staff was a little more energetic and on-point, it could definitely get the full 5 in my book."}
{"text":"Our first time at The Attic and we had high hopes. We sat outside on the balcony, which is just slightly awkward since you have to talk to your server over your shoulder. We ordered drinks and wings for an appetizer and didn't see our server again until our main food order came out. Our drinks sat empty until we had to ask the person that ran our food to find our server for us. Then once we received those drinks, we finished eating and drank the drinks. We had to ask two different people to send our server over with the bill. We had the Ivan burger and a mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were amazing which is why this place deserves the three stars. The lack of service really ruined the experience. We have decided that we'd go back because the food was so good, but we'll sit at the bar next time and not take our chances with the service."}
{"text":"This place is my jam! Their burgers are so delicious! Wednesday nights they have a burger/ beer deal. $5 off craft beer when you buy a burger. They have a wide variety of brews and change them out regularly. 

The Ivan burger and the holmburger are my favorites. But they also rotate specials and have some really creative burgers on that list. You can't go wrong with any burger here."}
{"text":"The patio has an amazing view. The food was superb, and Cheryl was the best server, ever."}
{"text":"I have frequent this place numerous times and have great experience,
but, this last Tuesday a slow night for them, it took 40 minutes to serve food, bacon limp and fries cold, which I always tell the server crispy bacon and well done fries. The server was nice but didn't take care of the few customers there. Also noticed on the bill we were told about the happy hour special but were not charged correctly.  Just a week ago I was there celebrating my daughter's bday, and it was perfect. I didn't see the owner or mgr there otherwise I would have mentioned it right there."}
{"text":"I am in freaking love with this place. Why didn't I ever come here before the name change? Yep that's right folks. That burger everyone loves so much was on the menu before the attic was the attic. 

Anywho... I came on a Wednesday and sat out on the patio in the beautiful weather Phoenix has a tendency to offer its residence this time of year. I peered over the selection of craft beers for something that shouted at me. Yes. A fine selection of funkwerks brews. I chose the deceit and the saison. And both would receive high markings from me on BA and untappd. I also ordered the Ivan burger and fries as part of the running Wednesday special. The fries were fresh and crispy and well seasoned. I love burgers. Love them almost as much as I love my first born. Especially gourmet, prepared medium, and housed by a pretzel bun. You need a good dense piece of bread to support the weight of such a delectable hunk of beef and apparently the attic knows what's up. This burger really is all the rave. Everyone should try it at least once. Peer pressure! 

I will most certainly be back. Most certainly for the beer and burger on Wednesday. Also don't forget that you're brews are $1.50 off for HH before 6 every weekday. If I wasn't saving myself for AYCE pad Thai I would be on my way there now!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have a great view of the mountains from the patio. Came here with my family and we shared different items. The dry rub wings, Louisiana wings (OMG good), pretzel with cheese sauce  (yum), the Ivan burger (super delicious) and the Sicilian combo pizza. Our waitress was great. Nothing better then enjoying good food with a beautiful view of camelback. Brother also ordered the wren sour beer, he enjoyed it. Definitely will come back. I have been here one time before and had the tacos which were amazing. You can not go wrong with their food, however, their menu is limited."}
{"text":"Oh wow, now I remember.
This is the place I went after getting thrown out of the Little Woody (across the street), only it went by another name at that time. 

I had several craft brews, got a spectacular view of Camelback Mountain at sunset, and got to eat someone's leftover half-burger. 
No I'm not homeless. What the fuck?

It's just that this old dude ordered a burger split. When it arrived, the chick he was scamming on was all...

    \"Who's that for? I don't eat read meat! Do I look like I eat red meat?\"

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down and shut the fuck up I'm thinking to myself as this haughty little ingenue delivered a scene reminiscent of Scarlet 'fucking' O'hara in Gone With The WInd, her every word punctuated and overacted.

After her performance, she hastily stormed out. That's when I nudged the guy and asked if he was gonna eat that.

Anyways, I got a great craft buzz, ate a good half burger, and made it down the staircase without getting all knotted-up. 

All things considered, this was a five star in my book."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best buyers I've Ever tasted! So juicy and nice portion. Not only was the burger awesome but the pretzel was spool good too! The view is awesome as well."}
{"text":"This place is kind of weird...not in a bad way, but read on. So this used to be Cave and Ives which was I think more Mediterranean and a little classier - we liked it as. The new place is definitely a pub like experience mostly because of the menu.

They added a ton of TV's which was kind of fun, but the vibe still points towards a classier joint. They still have a great beer and wine selection and the decor is awesome...but again, and maybe I'm confused...its a pub! 

We ordered wings and the cheese plate to start. The wings were fantastic, so was the cheese plate but here is what makes me laugh, the cheese plate looks like it was plated by a pub but tastes like it belongs in a wine bar. It was cubed artesian cheeses that were all delicious, with great sides of nuts, fruits, olives etc.

I ordered the Margarita pizza and boyfriend had the breakfast burger, which was HUGE but good. 

I think I am just confused on what direction this place is going towards, menus and beers say pub, wine, cheese and decor say more of a wine bar with a little sass.

Needless to say, for the wings and beer alone, we will go back."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and a beer! I was visiting from out of town & my (local) friend said it was a must try!

I have a burger and fries. Nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"My first visit here - tried fish taco, the hangover burger, and today's special fried oyster. The oysters were small compared to what I'm used to but I'm in AZ. What can I expect? Fried properly - ate with the house tartar sauce and it was good. Posted pix for other items and my comment, so check them out. Waitress/bartender was very sweet. So I'm giving 5 star rating for casual dining experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The quality of food and service is beyond what you expect from an ale house! Great beer and beer knowledge, great ownership and also very friendly employees. We got to talk to Carey the owner and his employee Tiffany and it was fun to chat about the business and what the company is about. I recommend you to come here if your local or even visiting!"}
{"text":"5 stars ONLY for the food. Amazing burgers and bruschetta to die for. Service was very poor. Bartender/waitress was extremely unbecoming and acted very inconvenienced to serve us. Would go back purely for the food."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer on tap! Burgers are great! Wednesday night burger and brew for $10.00 can't be beat. When the patio is closed it's kinda tight and crowded, but the food is still good and the beer is cold!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and I love Wednesdays here. They would get 4 stars except.... read on MacDuff... They offer a great, ever-changing, selection of microbrewery beers, ales porters and stouts from all over the US and Canada. On Wednesdays you can get their Ivan burger AND a pint of beer for $12. Now, for the bad news... Every, and I mean, EVERY time I've been here, either the service sucks, the server has attitude OR they somehow Fuck up something in the order. Sigh, but I return, always in hope...."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a good spot to watch a game, catch an afternoon break, or to spend a night. They have an awesome selection of beers / drinks to go with (what I would consider) very above average bar food. A sunny Phoenix afternoon  on the patio area, with the doors open is the best time to go!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place and I have to agree, their burgers are pretty damn good! 

I would appreciate a larger more diverse beer list, but for what it is, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! They also offer a gluten free bun and ciders for all you fellow people with gluten allergies"}
{"text":"Great burgers and excellent beer selection with many screens to watch sports.  Parking is a bit of a pain"}
{"text":"Beer selection is slightly better than Chili's. 
Bartender has personality of an empty keg. 
Bar had a good group of people with good chatter for you conversationalists. 
Food / Menu is small with just several burgers and some pizzas. It says they have an award winning burger but I did not try.   Although, when looking at the description, I am puzzled at how it has differentiated itself from others. 
I might try again but with so many good beer bars around it may be a while. 
Too bad as I was looking forward to this place."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had in Arizona, hands down.

Great atmosphere, awesome beer list and a friendly staff willing to let you sample their beers before paying for a full pint. I will definitely be back and will probably become a regular."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here last night to grab a drink together and it was a really cool place. They have about 20 different beers on tap and they were all different and very good! They give you samples if you want to try them. The burgers are great and the pretzels are good as well. The bartenders are nice and they also have a great outdoor area with a fireplace and heaters. I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Cold food and a cold shoulder. Customer service is better at McDonald's. 

I brought my food to the bartender because it was cold. No \"sorry about that\", nothing from my waitress, nothing from a manager, nothing from the guy that works here that was at the bar that let the bartender know I was there.  

Get your shit together."}
{"text":"If you want a place to come for good craft beer AND food.. this is where it's at. The burgers here are amazing! Best staff and really awesome atmosphere, and great local/mix craft beer selection, the handles around the bar create a really cool feel as well. Overlooking the greater Phoenix area with upstairs loft feel, on a cool evening with a sunset doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"Dont believe the hype.  This place is not that great.  Burger & Beer nite on Wed, is a good deal but not if you have to wait an hour to get seated.  Also, this place IS NOT kid friendly.  They dont have a kids menu if that tells you anything.  I told the sever we had 4 adults and 2 kids, she relys \"I only have a 4 top if you want to be seated now\".  Soooo, do I tell the kids to wait outside?"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great food.  Cool patio to hang out on.  Make sure to always check what the daily food specials are...it's usually pretty creative."}
{"text":"Tonight is my first time eating here. The cheese & fruit plate was very good! Their cheese selection changes daily. The bread & cracker that came on it was delicious. I ordered the Ivan burger. We waited a good 40 minutes to get our food so that's why I'm giving a 4 star. It wasn't too busy for a Friday night. The burger was very delicious! But the patty wasn't hot, it was slightly warm so that was a minus but still very delicious. The side salad was so good! They make their own ranch, best ranch I've ever had. They have a special I guess Wednesday's Friday's and Saturdays but our waitress failed to tell us that before we ordered which I would have liked to know.. But very good. I will come back & try this place again!"}
{"text":"Thank you Natalie! Great service, great food, wine and beer. You were very helpful with everything. Loved the Pinot, great appetizer and salads - just perfect."}
{"text":"For a Tap House, both Angel's Trumpet and Ground Control are better. 

First impression of The Attic was the annoyance over having to just find the place.They didn't have a clear sign on the road. Second was the required valet parking. I don't care if it's \"free\" (let's be real, you still need to tip the guys), but showing up at a tap house, you're not exactly expecting to hand your car over to someone.

When we got upstairs, they had a clearly marked sign that said SEAT YOURSELF, so we thought, \"okay,\" and started wandering around for a place to sit, squeezing ourselves all the way to the back and then circling around. No seats. Got back up to the front and asked one of the servers, who looked at us like we were stupid and said, \"you need to be put on the list.\" Okay. Take down your sign guys, why would you have that posted? So we sat in a small section off to the side waiting and proceeded to watch several other groups come in and do the same thing we did. Unfortunately, we couldn't warn them without jumping up and catching them as it is incredibly noisy on the inside and they wouldn't have heard us from where we were.

Food was alright, but not remarkable. Certainly not worth the hassle. And the beer was good, but it's not exactly hard to come across good craft beer in the valley these days.

It would have to be someone's birthday, or they'd have to have some damn, good special tapping for me to go back."}
{"text":"My party of four rolled in and up, but then one member had to take a call. The staff was very accommodating, as we ordered drinks and the food. Super nice waiter even offered to box the food for our fourth member when we ordered. 

Near the fireplace outside would have been a great place to have dinner except the weather was just a little too cold for me. There was a large party out there enjoying themselves though. 

I ordered The Ivan, hold the cheese, please. According to the menu, it is one of the top 5 burgers in the world, and I don't disagree (although I haven't had all the burgers in the world, yet). I made a New Year's resolution not to eat another pretzel bun, but since it was still 2015, I figured why not. Add avocado too, and bring it on with fries. I'll start that healthy eating in 2016. I wanted the full meal deal and paired it with a cider. Glad I did!"}
{"text":"Solid selection of craft beers updated daily (use TapHunter to be informed of the list) and simple but amazing comfort food. The burgers live up to the hype, the Attic wings (grilled) become a craving after having once, service is on point and overall the staff is great considering how busy they are on some days.

If you had a bad experience here, it's likely that you are a bad person."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and will not disappoint. The wait can be a little long, however with the food being prepared from start to finish it is well worth it. Always a great selection of beers on tap!"}
{"text":"The location and patio are AMAZING. Everything else is awful. The beer list changes frequently but it goes from bad beers to bad beers. The food is ok at best and service leaves much to be desired there are a few awesome waitresses but if you aren't in their section be prepared to wait 15 minutes minimum with empty glasses. Forget trying to pay you have to flag down a different waiter or bartender to get your check. We keep trying this place I really don't know why though."}
{"text":"How much do I love this joint? Enough to get epically burger/beer wasted on a Tuesday and suffer the consequences ALLLLLL day Wednesday! The food is great, and the beer selection is awesome... Don't fall in love with a particular brew though- if you go back the next week, they've probably already rotated it out. Sucks monkey balls, but variety is the spice of life, right? Riiiiight!!! Go on a Weds-they have a special where you can get a burger, side, and a pint for $12! We're talking a MASSIVE burger too- no half ass skinny girl burger. Also- the ambiance is adorable- overlooking some mountain (IDK which one; there's like, a thousand in AZ) and the music is interesting/ varied enough that everyone will be happy. Impress your date, or hang with your buds-  a good time will be had by all"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Maroon 5 - Payphone)

I'm at the Attic trying a burger
All of my taste I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Bo Bites, it's all good
Let's go and make a reservation for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The reviews we used to make
It's even harder to take a pic
That you're here eating next to me

The Attic is located upstairs in ... well the attic - wink.  Actually its just plain upstairs if you want me true opinion.  Came in on a Wednesday happy hour and apparently it's $10 burger and beer night!  Super awesome in my books.  

They serve mostly craft brews so I went with the Avery Karma, a pale ale from Boulder, CO.  The ale had a crisp hoppy taste.  For the burger I went with their special, a mushroom and swiss cheese burger.  Overall, it was okay since I didn't really care for mushrooms in general.  The burger was not as juicy as I would like it to be even though I ordered it medium.  The bun was probably my favorite part.  Nice and toasty, but soft in the inside.  

Service was okay, except I would appreciate more smile I guess.  In the end, I think I would definitely return to the attic for it's atmosphere.  It had a sports bar lounge ambiance with a classic view. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Burger + beer + game night?! Theeeee best combo to be at The Attic. Came here with a friend to watch Game 2 of the Stanley Cup championship and chose this place out of pure convenience for the both of us since it was the closest from our locations. It was a Wednesday, and they had a special - get any burger & a draft and get $5 off. For my burger, I got one of the veggie burgers since I'm not a big red meat eater & I didn't see any white meat burgers on the menu. The fries were yummy but the burger was honestly overwhelmingly healthy and are for true vegetarians (not me). 

The atmosphere here was awesome. There were TVs by the bar, outside by the patio, and all around the seating areas inside. It was easy to find a seat/table and watch the game comfortably. It was too warm to be out in the patio but I'd definitely consider sitting outside next time. Overall, this is a super solid place if you wanna watch any game and be comfortable."}
{"text":"The Attic is a great Arcadia gastropub; they have solid drinks, good food, and the upstairs outdoor patio view of the mountain cannot be beat. 

Parking can be a challenge, but once you've snagged a spot head upstairs to check this place out. The service isn't exactly overly friendly or attentive, but the wait is worth it. Take a seat, figure out what kind of drink you want (they have plenty to choose from), and check out the menu. I highly recommend a burger medium rare on a pretzel bun...holy smokes it is delicious! The fries are top notch as well. Some other good options that I have found yummy are the caesar salad, pretzel app with cheese sauce, and the pizza. My only knock on the food is that if you do not order your burger medium rare or rare they tend to come out like hockey pucks, and no one wants one of those burgers. 

The Attic is a fantastic place to grab some food, drinks, chill and watch a game. The view is spectacular and the environment is relaxing and pleasant. Don't expect to be in and out quick cause the service isn't swift, but like I said before it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome beer list. Top notch service! Friendly environment - check this place out ! We loved it. Veggie friendly :)"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this establishment.  It is located above a sandwich shop in Phoenix.  They had about 20 different craft brews on tap as well.  I ordered the Ivan Burger with bacon cooked medium well.  The burger was very tasty and cooked perfectly.  The burger does not come with pickles so make sure you ask for them.  The burger is also served on a pretzel bun which was actually really good.  The fries were decent but you don't get many of them.  The burger and fries were about $12 ($1 more for bacon) and a craft brew will run you about $6.  The bacon was a little too done for my liking but that was the only flaw.

I recommend going during Happy Hour from 3pm-6pm because you can get $2 off an appetizer and $1.50 off of a draft.

Finally, the best day to go is on Wednesday because they have the Ivan Burger, fries, and a craft brew all  for $10 total.  That is almost 50 percent off the regular price.

Check out this place for a great burger!  It's one of the best places in the Valley for a burger and a brew!"}
{"text":"Very nice outdoor area, dog friendly, good selection of beer and wine, good food and friendly staff. 
Had dinner here multiple times, haven't been disappointed so far. 
The fish tacos are good, and so were the bruschetta and the caprese salad. 
Lots of TV on for sports, it can get really loud but just being able to sit on the outdoor patio makes it ok.
Will be back there again soon!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing :) I had the sausage and mushroom . Loved it . My only complaint was that the server up charged me with out asking ."}
{"text":"Best Burger and beer selection in town! Friendly staff! Great place to see the locals and to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I like this place to try new beers or have my favorite glass of wine/beer. The lobster roll was good and just the right size. Service was good but had to flag server down multiple times."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty, but nothing better than what you can find at Red Robin. Nice atmosphere and patio. I'll be honest though, the biggest reason this place deserves 2 stars is the customer service. They poured us a flat beer, we immediately returned it, and they tried charging us full price for it. We only got half the beer price taken off after asking..."}
{"text":"I love the attic bar, they have a fantastic ever-changing beer selection, served by extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. Many times you will go to a bar and get very mediocre food, not here. The hamburgers are to die for, and they do have a Wednesday night burger special. The appetizers are also very good. The cheese and charcuterie is one of my favorites. They also have thin crust pizza that I enjoy"}
{"text":"My neighbor told us about the $10 Wednesday special. Before going, we verified if this was true on yelp. The reviews were helpful but we didn't know that we can't share the special. I ordered the Ivan Burger and a craft beer for $12 and my partner only ordered the beer I had. The portion was big but the burger was bland so I boxed my half burger and salad. The cost for my burger and beer was $12 but my partner beer was $7.50.  Again, he had the same beer I did...that's way overpriced. Can't say we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here with great anticipation after having been once before.  4 of us ordered The Ivan (3 medium 1 well done) billed as being one of the \"top 5 burgers in the world\".  Unfortunately the 3 medium burgers were charred to the point of bitterness on the outside, even if the middle was pink (as ordered).  We were starving and ate them but it was not an enjoyable experience.   Am giving them 2 stars only because of good beer selection and because I had a good burger in the past.  If this burger was my benchmark I would never come back and tell people to stay away.  Mentioned it to the waitress and she said they may have turned up the heat because it was a \"busy night\" ??!??"}
{"text":"Our server Cheryl was so attentive and sweet. I live around the corner and this was my first time in. I loved everything about my experience here. Had the Red Goat Pizza, WOW!!! And the patio was just lovely. Looking forward to coming back and defiantly requesting Cheryl for superb service."}
{"text":"Located upstairs this restaurant bar is a neighborhood gem.  Burgers are awesome and beer selection( craft beer) the charts!  Service is fast and friendly.  If you are looking for great local spot for food and drink come check the Attic out!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place quite often with over 100 check-ins on Untappd just from stopping by over the course of a year for a beer or two after work or just a place to have a good burger (highly recommend the Holmburger!) and catch up with friends. The beer selection is great and usually changes often which is very welcomed! 

Unfortunately the past few times I've been there the service has really dropped down where I am barely being waited on and servers only stop by to take orders or drop off food. Last time I only had one beer, not because I only wanted one, but the server never stopped by even though we had  empty beer glasses on the table. It wasn't even a busy night...

The worst part now is that even though they have a great beer selection with many uncommon beers, you are now CHARGED FOR A SMALL SAMPLE! I sometimes like to try a small taste before I commit to a large glass, now I'm charged for both! When you have 30+ beers, it's nice to sample one or two first before deciding on one... Horrible policy which is driving away myself and others I have talked to there. We had a good run over the past year, sadly I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, amazing rooftop patio, and awesome burger deal special on Wednesdays! My fiancé and I check this place out weekly! Highly recommend the fish tacos as well!!"}
{"text":"I am a participant in a \"Burger Club\" and once a month a group of us goes to different burger spots in search of the valley's best burger.  I had missed the night that the group went to the reigning king, Relish. 

Well I can say there is a new King.  The Attic. Among 8 guys, I think 6 of us agreed this was the best burger we have discovered so far. I have since been back 3 times with people who are not part of our group but who also love a good burger (well, who doesn't) and so far, everyone has loved it.  

Didn't think I would care for the pretzel bun, but it's the perfect foil for the perfectly cooked egg atop The Hangover. 

Only criticism I would have is that my burgers tend to get slightly over cooked here. But still delicious."}
{"text":"Great staff. Friendly and accommodating. Excellent rotating craft beer taps and the Ivan burger is the real deal."}
{"text":"Half price wine on Tuesdays. What?!?! Had already eaten before coming but ordered a caprese salad...amazing! Tomatoes were form, bread was crispy yet soft, and they used very tasty vinegar and oil. Waitress was also very charming! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite spot on Wednesday. $10 burger deal cannot be beat. Great rotating craft selection."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night as my fiancé and I are brand new to town and wanting to try out nearby restaurants. Our pizza (the pepperoni) was decent, they have a great beer selection and offer some wine specials through the week. Tacos offered for taco Tuesday were also pretty tasty. Service was good..We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great beer selection is pretty much all it takes to make this girl happy. This place fits the bill! A cute little spot with great beers on tap, good service. Had a yummy sour from Destihl and a $7 Mikkeller beer flight (which I thought was a great deal since their beers are so pricey). Didn't try any food, but the menu looked good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! My friend from out-of-town was looking for a good beer place to go to before I took her to the airport. She found this and we gave it a shot. Loved it!! We had views of Camelback Mountain, excellent food, and good drinks. I enjoyed the Ivan burger, which was amazing, especially with their special sauce to dip it in. My friend had the black bean burger, which she thoroughly enjoyed. We both enjoyed drinks, me with the mead. It was amazing! I would definitely go back to this place with friends as we all thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Always love The Attic! Super nice staff and consistently good food. Usually always get the wings, also great pizzas and of course burgers. Ambience with views of Camelback Mtn are awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was good. My party split the Ivan burger (5 stars) and the Goat cheese pizza. Enjoyed the meat platter app. However, service left a lot to be desired. This restaurant only offers beer and wine. Enjoyed eating outside on the deck."}
{"text":"Just maybe the best burger I've had in decades, plus a really interesting app menu and a great beer list.  All in a really nice space."}
{"text":"Great ideas, poor executions. 

In an area already over-saturated with burgers, the Attic is here to throw its hat into the already crowded burger game.  

The location is nice & cozy with a bar that feels like it's always happy hour. There's a decent variety of burgers on the menu, the pizza on the menu seems like a boring after thought, and their selection of appetizers is seriously lacking. 

I was really in the mood for a beer, but their beers we're primarily the heaviest, most high alcohol choices possible. I'm all about a nice craft brew, but most times I got stuff to do after I drink a couple pints. I dont want to be feeling like a comatose glutton after my food & drink. There needs to be some variety in their beer menu. 

The burger i got here was average, I didnt end up getting a beer since I wasnt in a mood for a heavy 8% abv brew, and the service was forgettable. 

So, with much better beer lists, pizza, & burgers in town, I dont see myself returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place. My clients talk about it all the time. So my girlfriend and I decided to come here for dinner. This place is located up stairs and we dined outside.

I never had a pretzel bun vegetarian burger before.. well.. ladies and gents. This is the place. It was so good. Get a salad though as a side, the fries were so soft and cold. I expect it to be hot and crispy. Nope. Our waitress was so slow! I think we saw her twice the whole entire night that we were.. if I needed anything. I had to get up and get it myself. It was pretty bad..

When we asked for the check. That's when she started to interact with us... yeah..... she was trying too hard."}
{"text":"This place is great, laid back and enjoyable. I took my husband there for his birthday, the Ivan burger is to die for and they gave him a little birthday dissent as well. The waitress was very amiable, and they have a great selection of beers. One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"IVAN BURGER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_vbou3kxE"}
{"text":"A couple of us were looking for a chill way to bring in the New Year.  One where we were not committed to buying a ticket for a lame table full of appetizers and the promise of cheap champagne at midnight.  We arrived here just after 6. The area around the bar was full, it was in the low 50s-mid 40s, so a little chilly to be on the patio even if there was a fire and a couple of heaters.  We chose a high-top next to the bar.  
This was perfect.  Very casual and relaxed environment. Good for a first date, a night out with friends or even dinner with the family.    They have a nice rotating selection of craft beers on tap and in the bottle.  Food wise they offered a daily special (Cioppino on the night we were there) and are known for their burgers.  We wanted a little something to wet the appetite so we ordered a few wings (Louisiana wings, a little salty even for my salty palate, like they reduced some Franks RedHot a little too much but still edible).  We also shared a pizza.  It was very good and agreed that we needed to come back to try the infamous burger and to enjoy a warm winter sunset on their patio."}
{"text":"One of the first bars/restaurants I've visited since moving to Arizona! The waitresses were super friendly (even recommended other local bars I may enjoy - thanks Ashley!). The traditional style wings were the best I've had in awhile, and their beer selection is incredible! I highly recommend this spot for date nights, small group dinners, etc."}
{"text":"First time visiting and wow! Great burgers! Max was a great server too. He was very knowledgeable about beers/ciders and helped us with our selections. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Holmburger. WOW. Just wow. The candied jalapeño and pancetta were absolutely delicious. This burger was sweet, spicy, tangy, and savory all at the same time! Even though I was stuffed, the pizza smelled so good that I wished I had room for one. I guess I'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"We came back to the Attic for their Wednesday $12 Ivan and a Beer special and left two very happy and full campers.

Great service, great beer selection (The Avery Tweak was amazeballs, 17.5% ABV and delish if you like darker coffee/espresso type flavors), and great burgers once again.  We both chose to upgrade our beers to a fancier variety for only $2 more than the $12 special but still made it out of there dinner for 2 for $30.

I actually sent my friends a picture of my burger to taunt them.  It worked. Now my friends don'y like me and want to come to The Attic."}
{"text":"As they state in their menu, I've definitely had one of the top 2 or 3 burgers in my lifetime here...and two of the top 3 or 4. Their service is great, fast, friendly and informative. It's in a unique location and is truly one of a kind."}
{"text":"Sweet heavenly awesomeness. I know I live close to some amazing places. But really, how did I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE? 

[Sorry about the shouty caps. Had to be done.]

Burgers, Holy BeDazzled Wonders of Pretzel Master Pieces. I am in awe of you. 

WHY 
Wednesday night $10 Burger + Beer deal. My life has been empty before knowing about this sweet deal! You can select ANY divine beer off their selection to match their burger. 

But, before I move on to THE IVAN BURGER, let me cover why this neighborhood bar should be yours. (However, I don't want you to come here. Where would I sit? :)

I arrived early to meet friends for a Yelp UYE. (Thanks Jeff E.!) Thirty minutes to kill so I ambled over to the bar. (As a side note: They have an elevator! This is important should you not be frisky in your step. Or, perhaps, may have consumed too much during your time at the bar. Just an fyi. So, FYI!)

THE BAR
The staff was super nice and directed me to the bar area, as well as letting me know there was seating available in the outdoor patio area. The outdoor area looks lovely, with a charming fireplace and copious amounts of comfortable looking seating. 

I never made it that far. There were some regulars at the bar who stopped me and insisted on helping me up to a bar stool. Before you judge, yes, I'm that short.  Also, I'm using walking sticks. So they were just being super nice. Anyhoo. The next bit will make ANY gal happy: They have purse hooks. WOOT!

In what can only be described as a PRIMO seat I faced Camelback Mtn. Being early has perks. Holy smokes. Watching the sun set is amazing from the bar. The outside patio view is probably killer. 

The bar rocked as there were two super nice bartenders spinning their attention out. LOVE them. The regulars rave about the bartenders for a reason, the bartenders are really that great. So are the regulars! I was so surprised to see adult talk amongst \"regulars\". Usually people who spend too much time at a bar, well, scare me.

Not here! I can't wait to go back! These were articulate adults from the immediate neighborhood. A solid conversation crowd. (The guys were discussing the merits of the different beers. Nerds!) The clientele changed slightly I noticed as the night progressed. Younger, but well behaved. 

HAPPY HOUR
Wowza. 
$2 off Bottle Beer
$1.5 off Drafts
$2 off Appetizers
Until 6pm

Subscribe to their Facebook page for other delightful promotions. (I did after my visit. They've got a sense of humor too.)

BEER
They've got lots of it. Good stuff. Multiple types of porter. 'nuff said.

THE DINING AREA
No reservations, generally four tops which can be put together for larger groups. There's a long table in the back. (That's where we sat. It comfortably accommodates 6. We had about 8. All good.)

Mood lighting is conducive for intimate conversations.

THE BURGER DEAL - Mr. Ivan
This fella is huge. You can't split or share him with a friend. You should come hAngry. He's HUGE! Filling and well prepared with your choice of cheese. Tomatoes, onions and chipotle mayo never tasted so delish on a burger...until you tried it on a pretzel bun. Seriously, you've got to try.

I dinged the review a star for the fries. I'm sorry :( (They're stringy and were almost air dry. Like chips.)  

Bookmarked for regular visits. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and was not disappointed!  Fantastic selection or rotating beers on tap, a lot of tvs with good sports on, and the Buffalo chicken wings had a great spice with a very good blue cheese.  I can't wait to come back and try more food and beer!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Firstly, I was recommended this place by a friend who must not consider me a friend because they told me this place was phenomenal. They must have lied. I came with my boyfriend (whom is a kitchen manager at another similarly themed craft beer & burger restaurant) on a seemingly slow night. We were excited to try this spot! There were only 6 other tables at the time we arrived so we anticipated a fast & accurate experience. Well, it was anything BUT fast or accurate. It took over an hour for two burgers & fries, & when it did come out, it was the wrong order all together. There was not one thing that we ordered (other than fries) that actually came out to us. And the server provided no reconciliation for the wait time or the wrong food, she honestly tried to displace the blame on us for \"asking so many questions about the menu\" that we confused her. I'm sorry, it's our first visit!!! This place isn't welcoming AT ALL & the servers walk around like are completely annoyed 24/7. We didn't even eat our food, other than a few of the cold French fries that came out with our wrong burgers. This place may have had good food at one time, but now they are just arrogant & lazy about their product. Like other reviews say, the market is overly saturated with burger joints nowadays so I'll gladly take my time & money to an establishment that actually appreciates their patrons. This place is laughable."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Amazing veggie burger, cool atmosphere. I would for sure come back to this place and have some beers next time."}
{"text":"I (finally) went to the Attic last night with the husband for their Wed night burger and beer special (10$ for both). I was surprised (and I guess I shouldn't have been) that they had valet... I have a huge pet peeve for valet, especially when I see that the car is just parked in a normal space...not double parked or whatever would necessitate valet... but I digress. We went up the stairs to find a chalkboard to put our name on the waitlist... cute idea. We waited a short amount of time and were seated. The place was very busy, but our service was fast, friendly, and efficient. The husband and I each got the Ivan with bacon, I got a side salad and he had fries. The burger was a very standard burger. It wasn't anything I was terribly excited about, but it was large and tasty enough for the price. I will say, I wouldn't want to pay full price for this particular burger, but the hangover burger sounded good. The salad was tasty and had a great balsamic vinaigrette. I would come back here for their specials again and would like to try their happy hour, but I am not sure that I would come here on a regular day (the hangover burger is 14$.... that's a bit steep)."}
{"text":"I adore this place. It's quirky location, secret entrance, phenomenal views and superb beer selection. I love the decor, happy hour deals, the amazing service and one of the top 3 cheeseburgers I've ever had. I cannot wait to return and have told so many people about this place Ive lost track. It's on the smallish side so definitely not looking forward to winter crowds - I'll be back before the birds descend. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. And don't get a salad. This is the spot for cheat night. Best pretzel bun I've tasted on the Ivan. The bruschetta is also fantastic.
Think I'll be back sooner than expected..."}
{"text":"I love the Attic even more now than I did when they first opened. I still enjoy the classics- the Ivan burger and their bruschetta as well as the revolving beer taps. These days, though, it is the Arcadia wings that win my heart and their big events like the crab and lobster boils."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for a couple months now. I finally got the chance to go today and see what the buzz was about.

The menu isn't too large; it's comprised mainly of pizza and burgers, appetizers, and a few salads. I heard the burgers were good so I decided to go with The Holmberg - pepper jack, strips of fresh jalapeños (I love fresh jalapeños - nice touch), candied prosciutto,  sriracha, spring mix, onion, tomato,  topped off with \"crack sauce\" (still not exactly sure what it is), on a pretzel bun. Well...all I can say is amaaazing! Truly one of the best burgers I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was the candied bacon or the crack sauce or a combo of the two but it had this sweet syrupy taste to it which may sound weird but man does it work. It was so good. My compatriots who tried it agreed that it was delicious. My friend had the hangover burger and said it was pretty darn good. My other friend had what I believe was called the Sicilian pizza. I tried a sample and it was pretty good. 

I also had two, yes two, glasses of Moscato. Mmm a burger and Moscato...don't judge me it was a good combo! Pretty decent Moscato. My friend had a couple different IPA's...I think they have different ones every day or every week? I'm not a beer drinker so I can't remember what the waitress said. 

The only real complaint was the price...it's a tad pricey. I think both the burgers were $14. The pizza was $15, the Moscato was $8 a glass. That's pricey for burgers and in such a casual atmosphere but the burger is so good I'd come back and pay It again when I'm really craving a good burger, but It will keep me from going often. On Wednesdays though they have a pretty good special - The Ivan burger plus a beer for $10 if that's your thing (beer...Bleah lol). 

Overall, the food is great so I'd recommend this place and I will go back in the future."}
{"text":"If you love craft beer and amazing burgers, this is the spot for you. Probably the best deal in town is Wedsnesday nights- featuring your choice of the specialty burger of the day or the Ivan burger along with any craft brew on tap for only $10. Seriously, it's amazing, the burgers are just about perfect everytime. The pretzel bun is the ideal bun for the big juicy meaty goodness as well, and just might be the best part. Clearly I'm a fan. 
Also, there are great views of camelback and service has always been good as well. Get over there on a Wednesday, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We went there on St Patty's Day. Our service was not so good odd cause it was not busy. Until the GM Jerry came over then our waiter seemed more interested in our service while he was at the table. I had a peanut butter nitro it was . They have a lot of choices though and so that means more options to explore. Our food was  we did not have the famous burger guess we should have."}
{"text":"What a great find! I have a friend who recommended this place and I wrote it down on my phone. I am glad I did. I just don't remember who recommended this place so I can say \"Thank you!\"
Amazing beer selection. Food was great, service was very friendly. I had a blueberry cider that was amazing. Burger was perfect, pizza was amazing. Highly recommend. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix this weekend, my BF and I came here specifically for BURRRGERRRSSS.  We were drooling over the Ivan Burger on Yelp before we arrived to the desert. So when we finally got to dine here, it lived up to our food porn expectations. 

Started off with the Meat and Cheese Charcuterie plate to share. YUM.
We both got Ivan Burgers. Medium rare. Perfect. Delicious. YUM YUM. 
Nice selection of beers to pair with our meal. Mmm Mmm Mmm. 

If you love to eat, throw back a few beers, and you enjoy a laid back atmosphere, then add The Attic to your destinations list."}
{"text":"The Attic has 24 of the best craft beers you've never heard of.  I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about beer, but this place reminded me that there are so many good beers out there that I've never tried.  A must try for the craft beer lover.

Our server told us that the beer menu changes daily.  I believe it, because the paper beer menu on our table had a slightly different list of beers than the two dozen or so written on the chalkboard on the wall.

The Attic does a good job of describing its cornucopia of malty offerings - giving the origin of the beer, the bitterness units and the % alcohol.  There is an early afternoon happy hour that is great if you want to catch a football game on a Saturday or Sunday.  

Oh yeah, and the food was pretty good too.  I enjoyed the cheese platter, which had a good sampling of fruits, nuts and artisan cheeses.  The gorgonzola and apple salad was phenomenal and full of flavor.  I didn't have one of the cheeseburgers, but they looked pretty juicy.

Did I mention they have a rooftop patio?  The whole bar and restaurant is on the second floor.  Tha patio faces north, away from the sun, and was a pleasant place to sit on a nice fall day. 

The only complaint I had was the service.  It was friendly, but glacially slow.  It's fine if you plan to spend an afternoon meandering your way through the beer menu, but if you're hungry you might be annoyed by the long wait for your food.  To be fair, we were a large party, but on the other hand the bar wasn't THAT busy.  Overall, though, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We went there based on Yelp reviews and the beers they carry. WE ARE GOING BACK because of our kick ass waiter, I forgot his name :( and the AMAZING food! This place was great from the second we walked in. Its not too big to be annoying and not to small to be annoying. I loved it and even got a growler to go. Our waiter knew a lot about beer and was very helpful when talking about the menu and the different things The Attic does on different nights of the week. Its a bit of a drive for us but totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome beer selection, great friendly service, and an interesting 2nd floor location. I got a hotdog I'll never forget and some sliders that were to slide for! The valet parking seems inappropriate and shouldn't exist, but you can always park across the street for free."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious, albeit a little on the pricey side.  My favorites are the Hangover and, of course, the Ivan.  The wine options are all a little too expensive for what you get, but you're at an Ale House, so drink the ale!  They have a giant ever-changing selection of beer with excellent prices that includes something for everyone, even wine drinkers like myself.  Ask your waiter for a sample if you're having a difficult time deciding.  All in all, the Attic is a fun place for a night out with friends, especially if you come for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The food and service here are amazing. My girlfriend and I had hoped for a full bar but the beer, wine, food and atmosphere were awesome. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty great burger, but super salty french fries. For an Ale house, the server's knowledge and their policy on beers should be significantly better. 

I wanted to try the saison, but the server had never tasted it and knew nothing about it (She actually didn't even know what it was until I pointed to it on the menu). Upon asking for a taste, I was told that I could not have one because their tasters are all 2 ounces. I said that I did not need anywhere near that amount...just a small squirt in the bottom of the shot glass to get an idea of the flavor. Amongst other excuses about not allowing tastes to keep the prices down, I was told that they have \"special\" taps that can't pour under 2 ounces. That's when I called BS. No reputable ale house, brewery, or most bars for that matter, would trousers to provide a small taste and risk a customer not being satisfied with their order. So I told the server that I would simply order and then send it back if I didn't like it since they were giving me no other option and she knew absolutely nothing about it. When I received it, as soon as I touch my lips to it, I could tell it was pretty much a sour... Something I definitely wouldn't have wanted had I known. Anyone with any knowledge of their menu should have known something this obvious about the flavor profile. I sent it back, but was still charged. I would've argued to take it off, but my friend decided to pay for it rather than make it an issue. Too many other great places in town so no reason to return. Hash kitchen is opening next-door, I will definitely be going there for brunch next time instead... or to roaring fork if I want a burger."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were looking for a place to grab a drink with a nice patio, and I'm SO glad we decided to come here! It was exactly what we wanted and more. 

We got bar/patio seats on the top floor overlooking Indian school. Their beer happy hour selection and prices are really impressive and I wasn't able to try the food but it looked and smelled amazing - will definitely be back to try one of their burgers. 

The best part about the experience though was our server Kaylen, she was extremely friendly, personable, got our drinks out quickly, and was the exact right amount of attentive. Can't wait to go back to explore more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers in the valley and by \"one of\"I mean tied for favorite . The Grind is my other favorite spot but definitely more creative menu options and 20+ beers on tap here. The Attic is famous for the Ivan which is not bad at all after it got ranked top ten in the world by a legit burger afficionado guy. Yet my favorite is the Holmburger and it's Crack sauce. Yes Crack sauce is my favorite. All burgers are on a pretzel bundle which is made at the bakery downstairs (Sacks) Most burgers are $10-15 prepared to your level of pink and come with a choice of sides fries side salad and maybe something else? I usually get the wings as appetizers. The house wings crispy areare my favorite. Not a huge fan of the dry rub version(forget flavor name) Thursday tends to be a a featured burger day. They have appetizers and entrees that they rotate (listed on bottom of weekly beer list also weekend brunch stuff they rotate. There was an old manager named Ryan who really brought all this together and totally passionate about food and beer as well. He's no longer there but still plenty of quality staggy that have been there a while. Tiffany is one of the bartenders that is usually there always peppy friendly and honest. I've never had any service issues so don't that random article from a while back on azcentral 3tv or whatever keep you from checking out this spot."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I am a young, 5'10\" moderately fit male who CrossFits only 2-3 times per week and occasionally eats vegetarian. My friend brought me to the Ale House for a burger on a Thursday night after a dust storm. It was a late dinner, but don't get me wrong I am an early bird. Admittedly, I was not used to the pacific time zone. I do think coffee helps me to get going early in the mornings (both my brain and my colon), but no more than a half of a cup before my GERD really flares up. A doctor recommended Tums but then I sometimes get constipated which interrupts my early morning CrossFit schedule.
After climbing the stairs to the Attic Ale House we were caught off-guard by the HORROR that had unfolded in front of us. The front of the restaurant reminded me of a warzone left for us to piece together the backstory. It appeared a patron had emptied their stomach and guts in a projectile fashion onto the doorstep of the restaurant. I could only imagine that the restaurant cast a curse so damning that he or she was able to make it only to the doorstep of the restaurant before being condemned to the most gruesome thing I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. As we tippy-toed by in disbelief we hadn't processed what we had witnessed until we were inside the restaurant. Most people would have left right there. For whatever reason we were drawn in further, ravenous zombies determined to find food. Maybe our subconscious could foretell the meal that was coming our way. Maybe we were scarred from the sight and couldn't dare to pass by it again. We didn't turn back.
We wandered like shell-shocked soldiers to the bar and sat down. I ordered the Amber Ale and the HOLMBURGER with sriracha crack sauce. What I later devoured that night was the BEST BURGER I've had since my short time here on this planet. And I'm a cheating vegetarian mind you! The crack sauce lives up to the name, making this the best burger I can remember. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, 5/5! I rarely still lose sleep at night and wake up vividly remembering what I saw on doorstep, but would definitely go back when I am in town again The Holmburger with Crack Sauce was well worth the experience. Well done Ale House!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm here, they run out of something! It's totally ok due to the fact that everything they DO have, is awesome. I ordered the Kolsch but got the Tombstone due to CO2 problems, loved it. No hummus? No problem....have the pretzel! There are literally 25 or so beers on tap so if they run out, the bartenders can always help you find something you like. Be aware that they charge you .50 for a taster which is a little cheesy, in my opinion."}
{"text":"'The Ivan', one of the best burgers in town. The bun is amazing & beer selection is impressive. Pkg a little tough but nobody home next door...Literally;) ps wings (santa fe), salads & sliders also to die 4!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger!

We stopped in for the Wednesday night special (burger and draft for $10). The restaurant is open, with neat decor and a nice ambiance. Service was good, too. The burgers were perfectly cooked (we asked for medium). The veggies were fresh and crisp, and the pretzel bun, though a little salty, was a great accent. Fries were fresh and fried to perfection. Our server was super nice and let my glass of wine count as part of the Wednesday special.

I really want to try their other stuff, like the pizzas, but if nothing else, try the burger. So, so good!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy being served wine out of a DIRTY A$$ wine glass, come to The Attic. 

There is noooo waaaay the waitress didn't notice how absolutely filthy my glass was when she served me. How dreadful & disgusting!

I won't lie- the pizza was delish but with one caveat: eat it all at the restaurant and don't take it home. The crust is weak and thin and even trying to reheat it the next day in the oven results in a limp pile of pizza-mush. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Solid place to go on a Wednesday night in Phoenix. The burger special that night will keep you coming back. The people are friendly and the beer selection is great. Best of all they switch it up every week!"}
{"text":"Let me start with my waiter James...AWESOME! He's everything you'd expect at a great establishment and more! He took excellent care of us, and took the time to check on & explain everything we ordered. The food...oh the food...simply perfect. I've heard about this place for some time, and I'm glad I finally came. Such an awesome deal on Wednesday burger night. A burger and a pint of beer for $12...you can't beat it. My picky ass wife even loved everything...including James! See you guys next week!"}
{"text":"My son just turned 21.  We decided to go to Attic Ale House to eat dinner and celebrate.  Alex, our waiter, was superb. He made us feel at home and was there on point with our refills and a smile.  We tried the pizza, wings and the burgers.  On a scale of 1 to 10 .......Pizza was a 7.  Wings were a 9.  Burgers were a perfect 10..!!  But the entire experience was a 10.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved it! Just above my favorite sandwich place. My friend and I shared hot wings (happy hour) and IVAN burger with fries. So delicious! Great beers on draft too. Definitely coming back for more, looking forward to coming back on a Wednesday for their burger and a beer for $10 special."}
{"text":"Five starts hands down for the view. Amazing happy hour for the quality of the beer, I would pay more .. The burgers are huge and not Donald Trump huge - actually big. Small place so be patient when being seated. Would go again a million times.."}
{"text":"There was a time I told everyone what a deal this place was on Wednesday. That is no longer true. They still have their Wednesday burger and beer special. But, what once was $10 for a delicious Ivan Burger and a craft beer is now $14 to $16 depending on the beer you order. They also used to have a weekly beer rep doing a mini sampling of a line of craft beers and handing out swag. The Wednesday I went, there was no rep to enhance the beer and burger experience. I also get the impression they cycle through waitstaff frequently. At least half the times I have been there the waitress has admitted it was her first week working there.

Call me old fashioned, but if I am paying $14 for a burger, I expect to be in a place with better than a basic sports bar atmosphere.

However, if you are a fan of burgers, they are still tasty. They pair well with their nice selection of craft beers on tap. Finally, their main drawing point and reason for their \"Attic\" name comes from being a rooftop bar with a of Camelback Mountain (if you overlook the busy Indian Bend Road below)"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer. I've been here about 10 times and have always enjoyed myself.  Our last visit they charged for a tasting, which they've never done before and they didn't tell us there was a charge. Tonight my wife ordered a beer that was supposed to be an 8-oz poor and came back with a 5-ounces. When she asked them to fill it the rest of the way it still came back short of the 8 oz. I don't know what's happened the past couple times we've been here but a I'm a little bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Ummmm, yum, that is all. What a view of Camelback mountain. I loved this place. Great burgers and the wings are to die for. Happy Hour is a great deal!"}
{"text":"One of the better burgers in town. The Pretzel bun is very tasty and holds up well . We shared the hangover hamburger and Sicilian pizza. I was expecting the Sicilian pizza to be a little bit more tasty. Hangover hamburger had bacon and eggs which earned the accolades from burger magazine as one if the best. The best surprise were the fries that come with the burger. They were prepared perfect, crispy but not over done.

The place is upstairs with a small parking area. If you are into beer, this is the place for you with a huge selection on tap.

The service was good and friendly. Could see this place as a great place to hang out to eat and drink"}
{"text":"While my Burger was amazingly good.....I still didn't love this place at all.  The service and vibe of the staff is that of an old dive bar in Cave Creek; only they are young girls. Weird.  and the place isn't that appealing unless it is your neighborhood bar and its just a proximity thing."}
