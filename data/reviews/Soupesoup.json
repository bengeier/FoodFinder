{"text":"Cuisine soucieuse de la qualité des ingrédients. Tout est goûteux et original. Un détail, mais le fait de nettoyer les tables avec du vinaigre au lieu de ces produits chimiques utilisés dans tant d'autres restos montre le respect qu'on porte au client. AAA !"}
{"text":"Soupesoup is hit or miss with the soups themselves. I have had delicious ones but more often have had watery, tasteless ones. The sandwiches are ok but overpriced. I always do appreciate places that offer soup/half sandwich deals but here you need to buy them separately. Meh."}
{"text":"1st time here, The Soup was tasty I had the Orange lentil Dahl - at 1:30 PM the service was non existent... i sat at a booth for 5 minutes and waited no one came ... so I went to the counter and ordered, although there was staff and it was not busy.  I even had to ask for a spoon when I got my soup...and I waited while the waitress went to the next table to take their order before bringing me a spoon to eat my soup.... This soup soup is so so."}
{"text":"Une belle place à déjeuner dans le Vieux-Port, en plein coeur de la Cité du Multimédia.   L'endroit est beau, neuf, clair, avec de grandes ardoises au mur avec le menu écrit dessus et des livres de cuisine derrière le comptoir.  Le menu est simple:   5 choix de soupes chaudes 1 soupe froide (3 tailles de soupes au choix) 1 petite salade 1 salade repas   5 choix de sandwichs   1 dessert du jour   1 limonade bio maison   Comme je n'avais pas trop le temps, j'ai pris une petite soupe et un sandwich à emporter (dans les 10$).   J'ai été servie rapidement (moins de 10 min en tout et j'ai mis du temps avant de me décider quoi manger) et avec le sourire!   Soupe (crème de légumes) : patates douces, courge, carottes, champignons, tomates, asperges, brocoli, fenouil, cumin, épinards, pomme de terre, crème, chili, lait de coco et coriandre Une bonne soupe bien épaisse. Peut-être un peu trop de choses dedans à mon gout, on ne goutait plus vraiment les différents ingrédients et je n'ai pas du tout senti le lait de coco. C'était bon mais je m'attendais à autre chose.   Sandwich : baguette, jambon bio, cheddar, légumes marinés, mayo aux olives, tomates et laitue C'était correct mais j'ai été déçue par les légumes marinés qui étaient en fait des haricots verts. Là aussi je m'attendais à autre chose.   Je trouve les salades un peu chères (environ 7$ pour la petite et 13$ pour la salade repas) mais elles avaient l'air intéressantes : -          Bleuets, endives, raisins rouges, copeaux de parmesan, graines de tournesol et épinards pour la petite -          Lentilles vertes, concombre, asperges, morceaux de poulet et ...  pour la grande   Ce lieu a le potentiel pour devenir ma cantine. J'y retournerais pour les salades. Pour les soupes j'attendrais une journée froide et pluvieuse."}
{"text":"Better... But not.  SoupeSoup has always been one of my favorite lunch spots. But since it's moved upstairs, it's really not the same.   Though the décor and space are a serious improvement, the quality of service and food has taken a hit.   First, you may not be allowed to sit. The new host (presumably new manager) insists on seating you and has twice recently told me I could not sit at certain tables because I was either alone or with one other person. Apparently removing a chair or separating two tables is not something they allow. Except that after he seats you right by the cash in a high traffic area, he will split the tables where you initially wanted to sit to seat two groups of two.  Next, you may wait an extended amount of time for your meal. Today took about 45 minutes and clients who came in after us got their food long before we did. And when we did receive our food, the portions were smaller and the quality below par. But prices haven't gone up yet!  Third, don't count on dessert. If you order the table d'hote don't expect the dessert to be what they tell you it is because by the time you're ready for it, it has completely changed. My friend asked for the table d'hote because of the dessert, chocolate mousse, and when it was time for dessert, he was told they had changed it for citrus mousse.   Finally, you may not get an apology for everything that went wrong. They'll offer to take the dessert that you didn't get off your bill but that's about it.  It's a real shame."}
{"text":"Honestly, for even cheaper, we can better at Première Moisson for the same amount of food. I understand that SoupeSoup has a very interesting concept and is conscious about health and well-being but to us, customer service is also very important, if not more! Would we recommend you trying out SoupeSoup? Of course, yes! But perhaps in another location. Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2015/03/23/soupesoup-healthy-food-option-while-its-still-cold/"}
{"text":"Les soupes sont originales, pas trop chers et avec beaucoup de saveurs. Pas assez de pain a mon gout qui vient avec la soupe. Les grilled cheese sont a connaitre car tes gouteux aussi"}
{"text":"We found this place on the way to Mount Royal.  It is a fantastic spot for a great soup and sandwich.  The menu is written on the wall (using chalk).  It is written in French.  I don't speak French, but was able to figure most things out.  The staff were friendly and willing to help and answer questions.  I ordered a grilled cheese and chilled mango soup.  The sandwich was the perfect amount of crunch and soft.  The soup was exceptional!  It had a hint of spice to it; that really enhanced the dish.  Highly recommended.  If I lived in Montreal, this would be my go-to place when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Avec la popularité fulgurante de ce restaurant, je m'attendais aux meilleures soupes du monde. J'en ai essayé 2, elles étaient bonnes, mais pas à ce lancer sur les murs. Ce qui est intéressant, c'est qu'elles sont disponibles en 3 formats différents.   Pour ce qui est des sandwichs, il est possible d'en prendre un complet ou un demi. Encore une fois, c'est bon, mais je me fais de meilleurs sandwichs à la maison.   J'adore le décor. Chacun des 6 restaurants Soupe Soup a un décor différent. Celui de la rue Duluth est très rustique et chaleureux. Des murs en bois décorés de tableaux d'ardoise sur lesquels sont inscrits les menus. Des tables en bois ou en céramiques colorées. C'est mignon."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful dining option less than a block from the Musee des Beaux-Arts Montreal! Beautiful interior, pleasant music, and delicious menu options. We tried soups and sandwiches and were very pleased with the presentation and quality of the food. We could not have been more pleased with our choice of having lunch here en route to the museum!"}
{"text":"the place can get a little crowded but if you're looking for something fresh that won't make you feel horrible after eating it, then look no further! their menu and plates are very simple yet full of earthy flavours. the service is quick and excellent whether you order to-go or to eat on the spot. a great plus is that the music isn't too loud like in most other establishments of this kind. highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant on several occasions, but decided to go in on this cold Saturday afternoon. The staff were all very pleasant and patient, all smiling. The food was incredible!  I had the tomato soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. It was yummy! The soup had a great consistency and just a bit of a kick.  The grilled cheese was perfect! Aged cheddar, multi grain bread, the best!  My friend had the cream of celery soap which he loved. I had a sample and it was really good.  The celery was not overpowering, good flavor!  I will most definitely come back!  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"You would think after leaving this place with one server and chalk board menus in French I would be upset, no.  No, that was not the case. The Manhattan Clam Chowder was like no other with the freshest ingredients. Enjoy the moment, hang out with good company, and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and O.M.G. the food was soooooo delicious! My husband and I chose this place looking for something healthier to eat and this place really hit the spot! And did I mention delicious?? We shared a salad that had red quinoa and beets - I'd like to mention that neither my husband or I like beets- and it was very filling and so good. We also shared this ciabatta sandwich with turkey and mango and tomato and I have no idea what else but the mix of flavors were amazing! I definitely recommend this sweet cafe!"}
{"text":"J'aime tellement cet endroit !  Les ardoises avec le menu changeant tous les jours, les petites tables en bois avec des chaises dépareillées, la musique, le staff. TOUT est parfait.  Quel agréable cachet qu'a ce petit endroit caché sur St-Denis entre Maisonneuve et René Levesque ! Tous les ingrédients sont locaux et la bouffe fait maison. (soupe,sandwich et salades) Entrer au Soupesoup durant une tempête de neige c'est comme rentrer au chalet après une journée de ski. ça sent bon, c'est réconfortant, et c'est tellement bon pour l'âme.  merci d'exister, vous me verrez SOUVENT."}
{"text":"Being just around the corner from my girlfriend's apartment, it was just too easy to slip into this cozy bistro located on Duluth's cobblestones.   The soups and sandwiches always rotate and are consistently incredible. Get the combo so you can try one of each. The freshly baked breads and espresso are also exceptional.  The one thing you cannot miss when you go here though is their Pouding Chômeur, probably my favorite dessert of all time. This maple syrup masterpiece, by itself, earns Soupesoup my maximum approval."}
{"text":"Toujours un plaisir d'aller se rassasier le bidon chez soupesoup. Possibilité de manger sur place ou pour emporter.  Les plats sont recyclables !  Menu sur ardoise : sandwichs, salades repas et soupes selon les envies du chef. Parfois ils ont également des muffins salés  au gruyère, je recommande ! Service  rapide et sympathique. A noter qu'il ne font pas de combos.   Pour un appétit moyen, un demi sandwich  et une moyenne  soupe sont suffisants. Le tout pour environ 13$. Si vous avez la dent sucrée laissez-vous tenter par les desserts décadents et préparés sur place : carré au citron, brownie, croustade de saison,  financiers au matcha...mmmm !!!   Bon appétit  !"}
{"text":"Beautiful & Comforting!   As you walk inn, you notice how beautiful the location is. Hardwood floors, crown molding, vintage touches and lovely lamps.  Round marble tables, with hardwood chairs that remind you a bit of Paris. All this for a bowl of soup. I'm happy already!  Service is impeccable! Shortly after walking in, you're being kindly greeted by friendly staff who walk you to a table. They explain the soups that are on their current menu(Which changes from time to time) and their sandwiches.   Now, let me take a few moments to decide which soup to order, do I want a grilled sandwich or not?   Within the soups, you have about six choices. Mostly vegetarians. Wait! Do not be turned off by that just yet. Come back and let me finish tempting you a bit more.     Every soup is made in house.. Served in two different sizes of bowls. (8oz 12oz 16oz) We decided to go for a small soup to have space for their grilled cheese.  My soup was a creamy, delicious and incredibly tasty corn chowder. Most chowders are made with a lot of cream and/or butter. Their version was packed with sweet corn, a dash of cinnamon, a handful of chunky vegetables on a chicken broth base. Finished with buttermilk to add that touch of creaminess without the heaviness of a typical chowder. Delicious!   Our second soup we've tried was a creamy carrot, orange, and squash with fresh ginger. Finished with a light drizzle of olive oil. The combination was perfect, and the added fresh ginger was the perfect touch of heat(Not spicy!) to warm you up on a cold, rainy day.   As for the sandwich. We had a grilled cheddar cheese, ham and caramelized onions. The bread was perfectly toasted, not  at all greasy or soggy. The cheese was melting to perfection. The ham was a generous amount, finished with the perfect sweetness of the caramelized onions.   We'll be back sooner than later. Especially since our entire delicious meal that made us happy and full, at the cost of $10 per person! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant ! A 10 minutes a pied de mon travail, c'est un endroit ou j'aime bien aller lorsqu'il fait beau et que je peux faire la marche.   Le menu change tous les jours. Vous avez le choix de combo entre les salades, soupes et sandwich. Normalement, la portion idéale pour moi est la grande soupe et le demi-sandwich. Le mélange des saveurs peut parfois sembler étrange, mais je suis toujours agréablement surprise ! Options végétariennes pour les intéressés.   Mon classique : le grilled-cheese sur ciabatta avec chou mariné maison. mmmmmm !!! Comme dessert : le fameux brownie à la cardamone !  Le prix est un peu intense pour un lunch, mais ça vaut toujours la peine de savoir que tout est fait maison et frais. Le resto est toujours plein les midis de semaine alors se prévoir un plan b dans le coin si vous n'avez pas beaucoup de temps.   Bon appétit !!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup?  This was the best grilled cheese and tomato soup I've had!!  A little on the expensive side, but was a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"La soupe froide du jour aux agrumes était délicieuse. J'aime le concept que l'on puisse choisir le format du bol : petit, moyen ou grand. Même chose pour les sandwichs, les petits estomacs seront contents de savoir qu'on peut choisir la demie-portion.   Je ne sais pas à quelle boulangerie ils s'approvisionnent, mais le pain baguette était sublime.  L'ambiance est très familiale et peu achalandée les jours de la semaine, on peut donc s'installer pour travailler quelques heures en après-midi. La vue sur la rue Duluth est très charmante.   Prix très raisonnable, 10$ pour une petite soupe et un demi-sandwich qui m'ont rassasiés pour le lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for lunch for vegetarians!  All the soups were vegetarian and there were 2 sandwich choices as well.  I had a grilled sandwich with swiss cheese, white peaches and onions, delicious!  The interior is airy with mid-century / industrial fixtures and about 50% of the chairs appear to be genuine Eames fiberglass with a mix of arm chairs and side chairs in bright orange and turquoise."}
{"text":"Had a delicious salad and soup, and the rest of the menu looked good too. The wait for service was a little longer than expected (I think they only had two wait staff working), but the server made up for it with a yummy coffee on the house."}
{"text":"I loved this cute little restaurant. I ordered the Le Portugais sandwich and it was perfection. Great place to grab a quick yummy bite! Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a Soupesoup fan. I like their restaurants on Duluth and St-Denis, and appreciate that they each have their own character. I was excited to try their new location. Yay! The place is cute, the staff is nice, and the latte and cookie I had were tasty as usual. Can't wait to try the sandwiches and soups -- I'm sure they are delicious as in the other restaurants, but I'll get back to you with an update after I try them. The only negative point is that I've always found their items pricy, but it's a nice occasional treat. Oh, and BTW, they take credit cards (which they don't take in some of the other locations)."}
{"text":"Cute spot with tasty, simple plates of food. Perfect for a light meal. The grilled cheese, tomato soup and beef sandwich all quite flavorful. Friendly workers here took care of us."}
{"text":"In a pinch, Soupesoup definitely does the trick.  People in Montreal seem to love waiting in line for food as much as the next trendy city, so when every top rated brunch spot in the area was packed 30-deep, our group gave up and decided to give this relaxed spot a try. All in all, not a bad back up option in the least.   They were out of the top two things everyone at my table wanted to eat (the tuna melt and the ham sandwich), but settled on the Manhattan clam chowder and Mediterranean eggs. Would I suggest anyone visiting Montreal (or even anyone living there) stop what they're doing to dine here? Probably not. But the food was fine in a pinch, the service was friendly, and that patio was nice on a mild spring day."}
{"text":"Accueil au top, serveuse très gentille et prenant le temps de nous renseigner sur les différentes spécialités culinaires. Un choix varié et des compositions originales. Au top!"}
{"text":"If you are coming here for a soup and a sandwich, it cant get much better. Lots of varieties and everything is fresh! We had the cream of cauliflower soup and morrocan  veggie. Take out also available. This place was empty early Saturday afternoon! Staff was friendly and accommodating. Even offering to remake a grill cheese if my daughter was not satisfied and offering to translate in French if I couldn't read the menu. We will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Great open space warehouse location for a perfect lunch on a rainy day! We arrived just before the lunch rush and ordered right away. The smells in this place are so comforting and they have a real variety of items on their menu. Desserts are over by the coffee bar.  Everything we had was delicious and full of home cooked flavour, This is a quick lunch place you need to try!"}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place... The space is wonderful, spacious yet warm. But the soup (!!!) was a disappointment and we tried three different ones in our group. The sweet potatoes in one were crunchy - barely cooked. The seasoning was off. All had the air of being quickly thrown together and not simmered and developed like soup should be. The grilled cheeses were ok and the wraps were fine. The teas were nice and served in nice teapots. Service was good. No menus in English but the server translated and was happy to answer questions."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing lunch here today while in town on business. Super busy spot - so the service was a bit harried but they were kind and super attentive considering the number of people.  The name of the restaurant pretty much tells you what you need to know...it's all about the soup.  Or in the case of most people that I saw, the soup and sandwich combo!  Each day has a different set of 5 or so soups and 5 or so sandwiches to choose from.  I had a Tajine de Poulet soup...a tasty Moroccan recipe with yams, cinnamon and dried mango...super creative tastes together that smelled divine and tasted even better.  For the sandwich, I had tomato and bocconcini on a swiss triange...yum.  Get there early though because they run out of sandwiches, so if you want to have a gander at all the choices you need to go at the beginning of the rush!  We finished off with cappucinos and dessert.  I had a traditional maple/cake-type dessert which has a french name I cannot for the life of me remember but it was to die for.  So if you're in the neighbourhood, love soup and don't mind a bustling, noisy atmosphere...check it out!"}
{"text":"Directions lead you into a field. Please correct your Google maps. This takes you out in the bush somewhere."}
{"text":"This is my second SoupeSoup restaurant visiting beside the crescent street one. Compared to the previous, this one has the decor of more rustique feel. The place is huge. They decorated the walls with funky paints and there are books everywhere.  Service is very friendly and cordial. You can either be served at the cash counter or at the table.   My friends treated me with a latte and carrot cake. Latte was deliciously creamy and my cake was so moist, and all the flavors from nuts, cream cheese and carrots were all flowing in my mouth. It absolutely succulent.   It's a lovely spot to hangout with friends!"}
{"text":"Average. That's the only thing that came to my mind while eating.  The place is cute, typical of this area. Chalkboard wall, barn wood and green plants.  The menu is limited. Which is a good thing...If the food is good.  I took the large lentils and veggies soup and I was so disappointed.  First the bowl was tiny. I am used to eat soup in Asian restaurant and this bowl would have been considered a small.   But I would have said nothing about it, if the soup would have been good.  It was...Blend. A notch better then canned soup. I could not distinguish any flavor. The broth had no flavor. No \"eye\" of oil on the soup, no noticeable spices.   I think I was hyped because the owner is such a lovely person and her cooking book is lovely too. But I just assume she wasn't in house.   I was so disappointed, I wanted it to be good.  I won't go back, there is so many good restaurant in the little Italy. If this restaurant where elsewhere maybe a 3 star. But for this area? No way!"}
{"text":"So I have been to almost all the soupesoup places. So far it has been great. This one is just ok. I arrived when it opened for the day. Damn! The odor of bleach detergent was very strong. The place was very cold. I got a latte, and it was decent. Sadly, I didn't feel cozy and comfy as the others soupesoup."}
{"text":"Compared to other soupesoup that I went, this one is huge! It was early in the morning, I think I was the first customer. The place is beautiful; all brick walls all around the restaurant. Two counters are present; one for coffee and the other one food.   The service was nice; since it's so early, I think my server was still waking up.  I just a got a simple latte, which was very good. I was all alone in this huge place... I had my own fun; I was doing my makeup..."}
{"text":"We were welcomed with open heart, it was really sweet. The restaurant is really a nice place and a great location in the heart of Mont Royal street.   Inside the restaurant, it's all brick wall. I just love it. My friend and I decided to hangout for coffee. We all got flat white. It was delicious.   The service was super friendly! The restaurant is adorable.   My only problem was the washroom; it was smelly. Barely any ventilation passing through."}
{"text":"Greeted with smile, and placed to my seat.   I am just wowed by this beautiful place. Very simple decor with walls Victorian style. Lots of modern paintings on the wall. The seatings are very comfortable.   Plus WIFI is available.  Menu consists of soupe, salad and sandwiches with wine/juices and coffees.  So I ordered a small soup called Farmadole (beets, carrots, zucchini, squash and tarragon), a half sandwich called Le Portugais (ciabatta, Portuguese Chicken, mayo, lemon, spices, picked onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes) and a latte.  It was the quickest served food.   At first I thought my soup was missing a bit of oomph but then I realize how delicious was this dish. My sandwich became so special because of the pickled onions. Everything in the sandwich was the right amount of ingredients. Simply made in perfection. Finally, my latte was absolutely succulent because it was so creamy.  Definitely recommended for amazing service, delicious and healthy food and beautiful place."}
{"text":"Première visite aujourd'hui. Le resto est joli, belle déco . La soupe excellente.  Nous avons tous été, déçu de l'attitude hautaine de la serveuse. On doit se référer a un menu papier pour comprendre les combinaisons possibles sur un  e sélection , écrite sur une ardoise. Nous avons eu besoin d'explications supplémentaires, pour faire notre choix. Notre jeune et jolie serveuse, a peut-être trouvé nos questions stupides, qu'elle a enlevé le menu de mes mains.  Elle était incapable de m'expliquer la quantité d'une petite soupe. J'ai vu , par la suite, le format gradué des bols. Elle ne le savait peut-être pas...le café est excellent, mais surtout il ne faut demander des explications, parce que là ,la jeune et jolie serveuse, risque de vous cataloguer dans la liste des morons de la journée. Bref, j'ai aimé la nourriture, mais je me suis sentie jugée avec mépris par la jeune et jolie serveuse."}
{"text":"A coté du bureau alors pratique pour le lunch, surtout maintenant qu'il fait froid, rien de tel qu'une bonne soupe! C'est conseillé de prendre soupe + sandwich Il y a plusieurs choix de soupes et de sandwiches, ceux que j'ai essayés étaient très bons Demi sandwich + soupe taille M pour 12$ total Il y a aussi des desserts, qui ont tous l'air très bons.. Très bon service Beaucoup d'espace et pas mal de tables A essayer!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I speak culinary....my \"parlez-vous Anglais\" can only get me so far...as does \"merci,\" \"bonjour,\" and \"bon nui\".  The menus don't have to be in English for me to find my way in keeping my belly happy.  My last day in Montreal this week and even amid the craziness of letting my sponge brain fill to the brim with all things job related we found time to have lunch. And I'm soooo glad we did.    Soup Soup is a bustling open room with 15' ceilings, exposed brick, simple wooden tables with an eclectic collection of teacher's chairs, 60's half moon chairs and simple stools.  We were seated at a farm style table that more than one party shares (these are my favorite kind of places because I love starting conversations with just about anyone).    A bottle of still water, glasses and a napkin with just a spoon on it was readied in a split second during the time it took us to hang up our winter coats.  Two floor to almost ceiling blackboards served as soup and sandwich and dessert menus.  There were several to choose from but here is what we ordered today:  Calabrese-slices of slightly spicy salami, grilled nectarines, tomato and a caramelized onion mayo found its way onto 2 of my co-worker's plate...for me, I went with the Chevre, puree apricot and grilled asparagus sandwich.  I know I know, but Cheryl you aren't that big a fan of Goat Cheee - I can hear my husband say....I just couldn't help myself, and I was greatly rewarded by my choice.  Both sandwiches were served on the freshest Ciabatta.  The tartness of the cheese spread on this fresh bread, with a schmear of the smooth sweet apricot puree topped with the smokey flavor of the grilled asparagus just took my breath away.   Let's move on to the namesake of this restaurant...the soup.  Two specific offerings caught our eye and we were sold!  My choice was the papaya/coconut/ginger soup.  Geez Louise was this incredible.  This flavorful broth, chicken undertone, had absorbed the sweetness of the papaya and micro-planed ginger topped off with coconut water.  There were chunks of papaya, slices of yellow onion, okra (yeah, okra), all throughout the bowl.  What a perfect infusion of flavors and just the right amount of seasoning.....the only, and I mean only comment against this perfection is that it could have used just a tad more salt and pepper, but simple enough to remedy one's self.  The other choice of soup today was the onion beer soup.  Perfectly sauteed or sweatted onions swam in a hearty beef broth that had a heady overtone of beer throughout.  No cheese topped this bowl of goodness, and to tell you the truth I think it would have ruined the dish!  With a bowl of soup and a half sandwich filling our bellies we gladly paid our bill and walked the 10 minute distance back to our office on Peel.  Happy Happy, Joy Joy is all I can say.  If you haven't taken your lunch there, you gotta go.  This will certainly be a repeat visit for me....already planning when that will happen  :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here with my boyfriend and the setup/environment was quite nice. It felt like a different homey kind of place.  The food tasted pretty healthy, (mine and my boyfriend's) I ordered the couscous salad with strips of beef and dried up cherries while my boyfriend had a delicious turnip soup.  The service at first was great :friendly, welcoming. But then towards the end, one of the waiters was quite rude when I asked for the bill. He kept pointing to the bill and saying that was the bill several times. I was confused because there was no price on it, it just told me what I ordered. My boyfriend then told me I could pay at the cash. Um, why didn't the waiter just tell me to pay at the cash instead of wasting my time and continuously pointing to my bill and saying \"That's the bill.\" Yes, I know that is the bill...Food was generally good though. Very healthy and tasteful. I give it three stars thanks to that weird waiter."}
{"text":"What a great gem! It's more of a brunch/lunch place than coffee house but features fresh homemade pastries and sandwiches. Their grilled cheese sandwich, made with local cheddar and onions, hits the spot!  We also loved the yogurt parfait which had a healthy serving of fruit compote, chia, granola, and fresh yogurt.  Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Charming place on the plateau with soups and light dishes. A little confusing when you arrive the you get seated and they tell you the menu is on the wall but you have to get up actually read it and go back to sit to order. I ordered a soup with lots of different vegetables including sweet potato was actually delicious alongside with a bio hotdog which apparently means to pork is from a local producer in Charlevoix."}
{"text":"Charming and lovely place perfect for a grilled cheese, soup, cup of tea and dessert. I go there when I have a cold it's s nice treat and perfect food in a beautiful decor and quiet ambiance. It's fairly priced with a great selection of soups and light meals."}
{"text":"Not worth the visit. Took ages to get the meal and the soup repas (meal) was served lukewarm with reheated chicken. Gave the soup to waitress and 15 minutes later I had to look for the soup because the waitress forgot to bring it to the table.  I left the soup and went next door for a sandwich.  My wife's quinoa dish was unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot in the Old Port for eating in or taking out. They do make good soups, but they also make good sandwiches and salads (although there's only one salad choice per day). The combos are where it's at: either soup and sandwich (half or full) or soup and salad. There are usually some unique flavour combinations on offer, although some days are better than others. If you go to eat in try to arrive early because it can get crowded and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"À venir. To come"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Loved the food and the soups were fantastic - fresh all the way around. Came here twice during week stay in Montreal and will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Un peu par hasard je me suis retrouvée chez Soupesoup sur les coups de midi. Je ne connaissais pas du tout et j'ai été ravie de cette découverte. Le menu est attractif avec du choix. On peut choisir entre une soupe, un sandwich ou encore une salade sans oublier le dessert. Le menu change tous les jours, une bonne raison pour y aller très souvent !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little family run restaurant with unique soups served with great bread. If you like a little variety, go for a soup and sandwich combo, they're pretty well all great. Personally I prefer the Duluth location to the one on St-Viateur, but they're both good.  I'd recommend a soup or sandwich, but its changing all the time; be adventurous and try something new!"}
{"text":"SoupeSoup is a solid lunch stop if you're walking around Vieux Montreal/Old Port.  It's housed in a very attractive, airy, sunny space in an old brick warehouse with giant windows, exposed ductwork, giant wooden beams, modern furnishings, and chalkboard menus, and buzzing with a mostly very attractive crowd of Montreal young professionals.    During our stay of only a couple of days in Montreal, I thought food and drink was very reasonably priced.  However, with the acknowledgment that bangs for the buck are probably hard to come by in this part of town, Soupesoup was an exception.  We paid just short of forty dollars (with tax and tip) for relatively modest sandwich-and-soup (or salad) combos and a couple of house-made lemonades.  The food was definitely fresh-tasting and presented handsomely, but it was honestly a little on the bland side.  Just not much pop.  But as I say, a pleasant place for lunch, and defniitely recommended if you're looking for lighter fare.  Warning:  No credit cards."}
{"text":"Amazing cafe! Aesthetically pleasing. A very calm environment to just grab a cappuccino or grab a bite to eat.   I came here after spending the day walking around Montreal and grabbed a latte and the \"poor man's pudding\" and it was so good!!   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch breaks for the past week and have been consistently pleased with the quality of food they offer. I have tried both the green salad as well as the quinoa bio salad and would say that they're both decently hearty so you wouldn't be hungry a hour later. As for soups, I usually go for the lightest tastes, which are usually vegetable based, and I quite enjoy them.  I prefer the location on Crescent st. or Mont-Royal, but the soups themselves taste the same! Would definitely recommend to all those who want a lighter lunch!"}
{"text":"Great space, open concept with attention to minor detail. Soups are incredible. My girlfriend got a sandwich as well and I regretted not getting one immediately. Fresh ingredients, well priced and friendly staff! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. I like the whole concept. I just wish they put a little more something something on the plate. They dumped the combo option which I liked. If you split it up now it's a little on the pricey side. They also run out of sandwiches fairly quickly."}
{"text":"had italian sandwich and pumpkin soup. too veggie not really my type"}
{"text":"Nobody likes to be in the soup,  but goin to Soupesoup ain't a bad idea for lunch if you are in Old Montreal. All they do is Soup's & Sandwiches.  Love going here. Wood furniture, Huge windows ,Natural lighting &  Reasonably priced delicious food. What else do you want on a cold day? Gets really crowded during lunch. They take debit, but no credit. They serve Alcohol too.  That's the most I can write for a chain restaurant  Food -  Good Service - Fast Ambiance - Casual Worth the money -Yes"}
{"text":"Boeuf and aubergine soups were yummy for a cold day. They hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Cute little resto that serves fresh food, baked goods and coffees. I went with a few friends to celebrate a birthday over coffee. I had a flat white which was really good. We also had a carrot cake, loved the cream cheese frosting.   Staff was very friendly and helpful. The resto has a very comfy and casual vibe to it. The furniture is all woodsy, which I love. They have books all around the cafe. Nothing spectacular about this place.    They need to put some attention to their bathroom set up."}
{"text":"Came for a quick tea to go using my barista passport. It's a beautifully lite cafe with low ceiling lights. More modern and fresh vibe compared to other soupsoup restos I've visited. I actually really liked the ambiance. Very close to metro and to university campus. It's a great place to study.   I had to wait quite some time to make my order as there was no one at the counter. The barista was very cheery and helpful in helping me select a tea. Unfortunately 2 of the teas I wanted were not available. Hurray for Choice #3! It was the first time I had a dragon pearl tea and I absolutely loved it!! The barista was cute to show me how the tea looks like before you added the water. Then.... I couldn't stop smelling my tea! It was just perfect on a rainy day! I wish I had tried this tea earlier.   There are some tables and chairs outside as well,  for those who want to enjoy their soup and a drink when the sun is out.   I would definitely go back to have a relaxing time and enjoy something from their menu. This isn't the rustic soupsoup restaurant like the others."}
{"text":"A really warm welcome to this cute place. Similar to other soupsoup restos where the furniture is all of wood. Nice painting decor all around the resto. They too have the menu written on a chalkboard against a wall.   I ordered a small New Delhi soup, vegetarian based soup. There was a ton of chunky veggies, it was good but lacked seasoning. I ordered a flat white which was okay as well.   The service was excellent which is why I would go back!"}
{"text":"Mix and match sandwich and soup and salad where the options are all damn tasty. If you want a full sandwich you can get two halves, each a different kind. YUP. That's pretty cool.   The space is beautiful. Wooden beams and Eames-like seating.   Staff is delightful and always friendly.   THEY SERVE STUMPTOWN COFFEE. If you are a coffee snob like me (its okay, accept who you are) this is the holy mecca. It is the best coffee with beans roasted in the Pacific Northwest. Not easily found across Canada or in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this restaurant at all. Everyone in there were so pretentious. After all, it's just sandwich and soup. The sandwich bread was so tough to bite into, it was very dry. The soup was okay.  I have to admit that they have a nice decor, but that was it. The waitress did not give me a single smile.  I would never go back to this place where everyone was pretending they were in a Micheline restaurant. I would prefer a warm and welcoming restaurant to have soup and sandwich and pay half the price."}
{"text":"This was my favourite part of the tour. The pudding was hot and delicious. The atmosphere/establishment looks very industrial"}
{"text":"Super resto pour un lunch de luxe, on peut compter facilement 20$ pour une soupe et un sandwich, avec les taxes et le service... mais ça vaut la peine!  On nous propose trois ou quatre soupes par jour, qui vont des crèmes et potages à des soupes plus légères ou froides l'été; quatre ou cinq sandwichs, des classiques grilled cheese à des créations originales, suivant les produits de saison; et quelques salades.  Niveau nourriture, jamais déçu, surtout pour les soupes, toujours généreuses avec leurs gros morceaux, bien équilibrées, bien chaudes aussi. Les sandwichs sont généralement délicieux également, mais sont parfois un peu trop légers pour ne prendre que ça. Finalement, les desserts sont très bons, du style maison (renversés aux fruits, pudding chômeur, brownies et biscuits, etc.)  Pour le service, lorsque l'endroit est plein il peut être un peu lent. L'espace est exigu et on ne sait pas toujours où attendre, avec une seule caisse pour prendre les commandes pour emporter et faire payer les clients, en plus de préparer boissons et desserts, ça peut être longuet pour la portion paiement. Cependant, lorsqu'on mange sur place, une fois notre commande prise c'est assez rapide, grâce à une liste d'items assez courte.  L'endroit est joliment décoré et éclairé, on a beau être dans un demi sous-sol ça ne paraît pas trop. Assez bruyant.  Pour se gâter, à l'occasion!"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup le soupesoup sur l'heure du dîner! C'est un choix plus santé que les fastfoods habituels, et le service est tout aussi rapide!  Ils ont une belle gamme de sandwiches et de petits desserts si jamais vous n'êtes pas du type soupe.   L'endroit est vivant et souvent rempli, donc si vous chercher une place tranquille pour étudier sans bruit, je ne vous le suggère pas!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant pour diner si vous êtes dans le coin! Comme le nom l'indique, leur spécialité est la soupe! Jai pris celle tomate et basilique (le menu change souvent) avec un grilled cheese et j'ai adoré!   L'ambiance est calme et chaleureuse ! A decouvrir!"}
{"text":"I went there one week after the opening. I ordered a big bowl of mushroom soup with bread on the side. The waitress was quick and efficient.   My order came in and I was surprise that it was a tomato soup with mushrooms in it. The bread was delicious and the soup was even better.    The place is well decorated with pillows and a fur carpet for the chair(if this is how we call it). I applaud the owner for the well decorated spacious place. The location is perfect for the hungry students who don't want to walk 30 minutes to cote des neiges to grab a bite and it is more healthier than ordering pizza all the time."}
{"text":"Ended up here for lunch after seeing the massive line outside Schwartz's. This is a nice spot for a healthy lunch. There is a good selection of hot and cold soups and a few sandwiches. The menu is not big and changes frequently (during the hour or so we were there, 2 soups sold out and new ones were put up on the blackboard). Everything is super-fresh. The space is casual and inviting with a few small outdoor tables.   I like that soups are available in small, medium, and large (large would be good enough for a meal on its own) and sandwiches are available as half or whole. I had a small cream of cauliflower and zucchini soup with a portobello and goat cheese sandwich on baguette. Delicious, simple, and flavourful. DC's also liked their orders -- a beet soup with sour cream, a chilled tomato soup, shrimp sandwich on a hotdog bun... We shared the pudding chomeur (after reading Ben L.'s recommendation). It's sweet and buttery and delicious -- great for sharing too. I wish we had room to sample the other desserts on offer, like the berry crumble, homemade cookies, or panna cotta -- all reasonably priced under $5.   Service was friendly. They had to ask us again for our order because they mixed up who had which soup with which sandwich, but they were very polite and efficient about it. I also like that unlike most places in Montreal they don't immediately switch to English if you are Anglophone (they'll switch if you switch, but if you want to speak French, albeit with an accent, they will let you)."}
{"text":"Formule parfaite pour le dejeuner, c'est bon et sain dans un endroit lumineux avec une super deco ! Sur du bonheur :)"}
{"text":"This is a chain of six stores around Montreal; this one is by far the largest and busiest.  My wife and I also ate at the one on St. Denis in the Latin Quarter and the one at the Jean Talon Market. Soups are very good and not overpriced.  They change what they offer every day, so you never know what will be available usually having five or so. Their salads are also good, but the pork sandwich I tried was not so good. This is a casual place open for lunch only although I saw that the Wellington store was also open for breakfast, but I'm nt sure what they serve. Cash and debit cards only."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at this cute little soup shop near the Montreal museum of fine arts.  It's in a rather unassuming place so make sure to keep your eyes peeled for this one.  The folks here were friendly and though the menus were all in French (as to be expected) they were helpful in guiding us through things.    The soups were great.  The name escapes me but I had a cold cream soup that was fabulous.  It reminded me of an Italian creamy pesto-infused gazpacho.  The Portuguese sandwich I had was also tasty.  The chicken was flavorful and zesty.   It's also great they have free wifi here and while the service might be a tad slow due to the limited number of employees I saw in this location, the food is solid.  This is a great place to hit up after a day at the nearby museum."}
{"text":"Our final stop of the Old port food tour and my favorite! They had warm poor man's pudding fresh out of the oven waiting when we arrived, perfect remedy for below 20C temps! Loved the tall ceilings and huge windows that let in plenty of afternoon sunshine so much we decided to linger after our tour with cappuccinos, which were creamy, strong and delicious. On my list next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"I walked by this place last night and decides to go in to have a soup and warm up. Our first impression was positive and there was a very relaxed vibe. It was pretty quiet and light music was playing. The waitress greeted us and quickly brought us water. I ended up splitting the large Mexican soup with my friend  instead of getting two smalls as it was a better value. The soup was not the best I'd ever had but was nonetheless tasty. I was expecting a thicker soup and it ended up being a bit too liquidy for my liking. It came with bread and butter that was perfect of dipping.  The service was really good and the waitress was super friendly. I'd go back for a quick bite when I'm in the area. Atmosphere: 5/5 Food 3/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"What kind of soup place doesn't have soup at 750 pm when they close at 10pm? I won't be coming back for an unreliable menu and a restaurant that cannot plan according to demand."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cute joint to grab an afternoon pick-me-up. I had drove from Quebec City and needed some caffeine if i wanted to stay up for the rest of the day. Though the latte was tasteless, the sandwiches were out of this world. My boyfriend and I decided to eat here at 2 for a mid-day munch. I ordered the ricotta sandwich or Courge rôtie et ricotta. He ordered the Poulet à l'italienne. All of the ingredients were super fresh and super delicious. The sizes and prices were reasonable. If I had to choose one over the other, I would go for the Ricotta sandwich. I wish this place was in my area!"}
{"text":"I have only gotten the unemployed man's pudding here, it is really good and therefore my go to when I have a craving. The staff has been friendly and the decor has been nicely thought-out, which would make you think the place is pricey, but it's pretty affordable. I'd like to come back to try their soups and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"A la recherche d'une bonne soupe maison ? N'allez pas plus loin, Soupesoup est l'endroit y idéal pour cela. Il est possible de déguster son bol fumant sur place mais aussi d'emporter (et ce, dans divers formats). Personnellement, j'ai un faible pour le mélange choux, brocolis et cèleris qui était un vrai régal !  L'endroit est aussi très chaleureux et accueillant, sans oublier qu'il s'y dégage une agréable odeur de soupe (c'est parfait l'hivers).  Bien que spécialisé dans la soupe, on peut tout de même y trouver d'autres mets comme des sandwichs, salades,...et on peut également y prendre son petit déjeuner."}
{"text":"The location is absolutely lovely, but the soup offering was pathetic. I ordered a vegetable soup, it barely had any vegetables in it. It was practically just bouillon."}
{"text":"Went to SoupeSoupe for lunch. I had the meal soup (ratatouille in veggie broth, topped with chopped grilled chicken and fresh spinach) with a slice of bread and my husband had the portuguese chicken sandiwch with a side of morrocon soup. It's a rainy, cold, blah day so my meal soup was pretty perfect for how I felt. It warmed me up and was extremely hearty with an array of veggies. I also never thought of topping a hearty soup with fresh veggies but it adds a really nice texture to the soup so I might try this at home. The soup was delicious and easy on my stomach. That said, I was left... not hungry. But not exactly full. So, if you're starving, the meal soup will not be enough. My husband found the morrocan soup tasty, he really enjoyed the lightness added by the citrus and mint. The portuguese chicken sandwich was very filling but, the only thing that made it portuguese was that it was spicy? He also found it rather salty. Overall, an okay sandwich, could be good minus the over salting and minus the expectation of Romados chicken. Service was fast and pleasant! I found that they improved the service since the last time I came (few years back). Back then, there were no menus, we had to get up and check the blackboards, at the end of the meal, we had to get up and go to the cash ourselves. I found it inefficient and slow. Today, it's the standard, waitress comes by with a menu and they come by to take your payment and they do a good job. There's nothing super stellar about this place but if you need a quick lunch that fills you (go for soup & sandwich) or something to ease your stomach or sinuses (the meal soup), SoupeSoupe is for spot on."}
{"text":"Je travaille presqu'en face du local. Les gens du coin savent qu'il était auparavant occupé par une institution du quartier, un restaurant familial de type déli qui était kitsch mais réconfortant. Cependant, j'étais bien contente quand j'ai vu l'enseigne Soupesoup, ayant bien aimé mes visites précédents à leurs succursales du Vieux-Montréal et des Galeries d'Anjou (fermé maintenant). Ça s'annonçait bien.  Depuis l'ouverture, je suis allée prendre pour emporter et dîner directement sur place autour d'une dizaine de fois. J'y retourne surtout, principalement, parce que c'est vraiment juste à côté et que l'offre alimentaire est nulle autour. L'accueil est bon, le personnel est souriant, mais on m'a négligée 2 fois en oubliant ma commande ou en oubliant de venir la déposer au comptoir. Les sandwichs et les soupes sont tous goûteux et les ingrédients sont frais, rien à redire. Le menu change régulièrement aussi, c'est un atout en l'absence de d'autres options dans le coin. J'ai vu des employés/collègues attablés à quelques reprises, et je dois dire que c'est vraiment un bel espace qui donne le goût d'y tenir une conversation professionnelle, ou de souligner un événement avec son équipe.   Je me gratte un peu la tête à propos des prix demandés. Pour le café, ça n'en valait pas du tout la peine à mon avis, les multiples cafés étudiants en proposent du bien meilleur à 50 sous ou 1$ avec sa propre tasse. Pour les repas, ça se défend mieux, parce que comme je disais, les ailments sont frais et sains. Toutefois, je trouve que c'est une fourchette de prix bizarre: simplement trop cher pour devenir un lunch de tous les jours, mais en même temps, si j'avais le budget, je pourrais pour quelques dollars de plus obtenir un dîner vraiment plus huppé.  En bref, tant que mon travail sera tout près, j'y retournerai, mais je ne ferais pas le détour pour y manger spécialement."}
{"text":"The decor of this location is very pretty, it's also spacious so it's perfect for big groups. Yet, I wasn't really impressed with the soup I've ordered (soup repas) take out was good but $15+ for a pretty average portion of soup is kind of expensive. Also, the service was just okay, perhaps they were busy. I'd definitely try another location before giving my verdict on this chain, but this restaurant in old port was just okay."}
{"text":"It was freezing cold and soupesoup saved us from hunger. The spicy chicken hot pressed sandwich was light, yummy and great with hot soup. The only minor drawback was it does not accept credit card and only accepts cash or Canadian debit card."}
{"text":"A force de passer devant j'ai finalement franchi la porte de ce petit coin au marché Jean Talon.  Si vous cherchez une place pour une petit lunch équilibré et chaleureux, c est parfait!  Au chaud pendant qu'il fait froid dehors j'ai savouré ma soupe de pois jaunes et maïs avec ma salade de quinoa comme une enfant :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge soup fan, so pleasing me was not an easy job for this place! But believe me... I loved the soup! I tried the Indian one, with lentils and was very good, but the beet and ginger one was delicious and is by far my coup de cur. À coté, I split a ham sandwich with apple spread. The apples did a great job adding this sweet-ish flavour...   The guy who runs the place is talkative and very welcoming. He definitely makes a difference.   On top of everything, it was winter and raining... so picture yourself siting on the window, looking outside... cold and rainy... and you having a soup... yep... it was just as perfect like that."}
{"text":"Their food is super clean, and feels almost homemade and pretty healthy which is great! The interior is very cute inside and if you get a chance, sit on the bar near the window cause you get wonderful sunlight. They offer vegetarian options and wanting to save on meat, I took the pita adonis (with hummus) and it tasted very fresh and was pretty good as well! If you're tired of eating fast food and want some sandwiches that are a bit healthy go here! The price is pretty affordable too and the manager is super nice and so are the staff!"}
{"text":"//Only place in the downtown core//(Update: Mandy's now too) you can find a vegetable meal that doesn't also require a commitment to vegan or raw foods.   The lunch hour opening hours and fast depleting daily menu will require planning and an open mind on your part. Never come here with a insatiable craving for something specific.  The variety of soups is fun to return to throughout the week. The only soft spot is the almost non existent spice. Which isn't to say they lack flavour, but rather any sort of kick or daring you might expect from a place so dedicated to the broth arts.   Super affordable unless you also want a sandwich, in which case be prepared for a $20 lunch.   Also the pudding chomeur is worth a trip by itself. FYI.   Please show up before 12 or after 1."}
{"text":"I really love going to Soupe Soup ! They have delicious and healthy choice of sandwich, soup and salad. Even desert are awesome and almost healthy ;)"}
{"text":"The cauliflower soup and pulled pork sandwich were yummy. Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Montreal is cold. When you're cold, soup is good. Soupesoup serves soup. Go to Soupesoup when you're in Montreal.   Impeccable logic right there.   I was walking by without really knowing what I wanted for lunch, but I stopped being able to feel my face so I had to make a quick decision. This cute basement level spot was bustling with hardly a seat open at their wooden tables, so I grabbed a seat at one of the counters lining the walls. Each seat was set with a spoon, a napkin, a bottle of water and a glass. That's everything you need for soup.  Soupesoup may not have a menu written in English, but it does have the cutest, friendliest staff that will gladly do their best to tell you all about the soups they've got at the moment. From what I could understand, all the soups are vegetarian, so I settled on the cauliflower and chick pea. It was rustic, chunky, and full of flavor.   I also went for a grilled cheese, which unlike most of the ones in the States, wasn't griddled with tons of butter, but rather actually grilled and filled with non-neon cheese and caramelized onions. Quite tasty, and I imagine a bit healthier than what I'm used to.  They only take debit (no credit), which is how I found out that American debit cards are different, but everyone takes American dollars because the exchange rate was essentially 1:1.   I like Soupesoup. Which, for the record, I call \"soupy soup.\" I don't know if that's wrong, but people laugh at me when I say it."}
{"text":"Excellente sandwicherie, belle qualité, agréable, amicale. Selon mon invité européen, l'endroit fait très \"montréalais\" dans l'esprit.  Un must pour le lunch.  Ils ont même du vin en importation privée.  Devrait faire partie de mes habitudes."}
{"text":"I just returned from a whirlwind vacation with people who plan parties. Many of whom, do so for a living. The night before we had our night plotted from 3pm onward, the evening following our time at Soupesoup we had plans that involved a limo and some syrup. We're plotters, and like small children, we do best collectively when we're sticking to a schedule.   On this Sunday morning we decided to wing it.   Sooo we were all wandering around like hungry zombies, break up vibes were in the air and places either had two-hour lines (sup L'Avenue) or looked stupid (name withheld to protect what is probably a totally fine restaurant).   Soupesoup served brunch and had a patio, which made it good enough for us. I had a mimosa, the breakfast sandwich and an Americano. They were all delicious and I would happily sit in the sun and eat eggs here again. Hell, maybe next time I'll even try some soup."}
{"text":"Grand local , fenestration tout autour, ambiance tranquile, choix simpliste efficace et santé. Wifi dispo."}
{"text":"J'adore la deco cafeteria/ usine , avec qq plantes superbe fenestration, bon service. Un petite soupe de passage fait du bien mais un peu cher ..."}
