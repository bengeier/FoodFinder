{"text":"My second time here - consistently great food and cocktails. I had the painkiller #3 and the spiced rhum and ginger, so delicious. I think their cocktails are reasonably priced for Toronto.  Special shoutout to the staff. Everyone is very friendly and relaxed. No one will be rushing you out the door.   Make sure you visit the unisex washroom and enjoy the wallpaper. :)"}
{"text":"Cool place. Great atmosphere. Interesting drinks fun drinks fun place. the food on the other hand kind of bland and kind of too salty. maybe I'm missing something on the food side but I give it a 3."}
{"text":"I'd give 0 stars if that was an option. Last night in the city and I was eager to check this place out. Got a drink that was pretty good and their oxtail and beans to go. At first I thought they used pretty strong herbs to make the meal, a few bites after and I was certain the oxtail they served me was spoilt!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and has a fun ambience but the food is quite disappointing and expensive. Nothing special..."}
{"text":"Have been here a dozen times, can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review!  Favorite place (bar or restaurant) in Toronto, hands down.   The staff are incredibly friendly and remember repeat customers, often by name. The drinks are some of the best you'll find in the city, especially when you consider the prices. The Dark & Stormy and Wray & Ting are somehow only $9 and $10 respectively, but are strong, well-balanced and delicious. Their other cocktails are more expensive but all 2-2.5 ounces, you really can't go wrong.  The food is even better than the drinks, especially the Mac & Cheese (best in the city). The Griot is also fantastic.  Most importantly, the music and atmosphere is really welcoming and you always feel like you're at a private resort instead of downtown Toronto. I always bring friends visiting the city here and they fall in love with it."}
{"text":"I've only been to Rhum Corner once to meet some friends for a drink -- was only there for an hour but really enjoyed the place; it gave a really cool/ chill vibe.   I really enjoyed the ambiance and the great music playing -- even better with a great drink on hand. Place is a bit small but cozy. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for so long! I finally did and the food was as described many times before - wholesome deep fried yummy goodness! We ordered the griot which came with plantain frites and the goat over polenta. Both were very good. Loved the frites!!!  We also ordered the pinacolada and dark stormy. They were strong, but for $8 & $9 they came is glasses that were rather small. It def wasn't enough for a buzz or anything near it. Or maybe I am a lush...hmmm.   The setting was dark and romantic. For a wednesday night it was pretty full. Lastly, it is cash only and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"I know this place just opened last Sunday but we had such a good experience here on Thursday night that I think it's fair to give it a hearty thumbs up.  First off, the value proposition here is insanely good. Small plates are $4-8 and mains are $11-12. I'd say that if you're hungry you would need a main + one small plate and if you're just looking for a light meal you could probably just do a main. We were a group of 7 so we ordered most of the things on the menu just to give them a try and even then our bill was very reasonable.   Also great is that you can order Barbancourt rum in a 1/4, 1/2 or full bottle for $24, $48, and $98 dollars respectively (though they may want to check the math on that last one) and it gets brought to your table with a bucket of big ice cubes (which melt less quickly), a glass bottle of coke, and lime wedges.  If you're here with a group this is kind of a no brainer. As a side note, I'm not sure what the intent is for the hours of this place but I hope they keep it open late on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays as I would love to come here late night to drink a couple of rum drinks and order a few snacks with friends instead of packing into a bar.  Re: the food, it was uniformly good and consists primarily of hearty meats with rice and legume sides. Haitian Picklese (basically a slightly spicy pickled cabbage) comes in a jar at every table and is recommended to accompany every dish to help balance the rich flavours.   My personal favourite dishes were: 1) Goat - which was stewed until tender with nutmeg and other spices and served with legumes.  2) Griot - a traditional Haitian dish that consists of slightly tangy fried pork shoulder (and possibly belly?) served with rice 3) Salt cod patty - like a Jamaican beef patty but with a peppery salt cod filling (which gave it a distinctly Portuguese vibe 4) Dessert - which consisted of fried plantains on a scoop of remarkably soft and creamy coconut ice cream.   The space had a cool vintage Carribean vibe, and was made very warm with the addition of lots of candle light  and an ecclectic mix of Carribean folk music as the soundtrack. Service was very friendly and attentive.  In conclusion, go here; it's really good, really affordable and might even spark a further interest in Haitian culture and cuisine (It did for me - I just spent the last hour in a Wikipedia wormhole).   -Brian"}
{"text":"Had dinner at black hoof and came here. After visiting rhum corner I realized that THIS may be the place that all my money will go to. They have a pretty awesome collection of delicious rum from their beautifully displayed shelves behind the bar... With a sliding ladder. SLIDING LADDER... Now i know this feature isn't really worth mentioning but i totally pictured myself sliding back and forth on that thing with a bottle of el dorado 12 yr in hand as happy as a pig in a peach orchard. Ya. So this place is good. Their wray and ting is on point. Try some of their rums and chat with the staff because they're pretty damn cool. Didn't have any food but I'm sure that's amazing too..."}
{"text":"Genuine Cuban ambiance, from the decoration to the music, with a large range of Rums from all over the world, and very good cocktails as well. The frozen mojito is one of my favourite drinks at Rhum Corner."}
{"text":"Great food (except for the plantains). Great drinks. Awesome vibe. Good looking staff and clientele. Great area. And slushies!!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Rhum Corner with a small party of 4 on a Wednesday night. We were sat promptly and service was great. Try the dark and stormy cocktail - absolutely delicious.   I found the food - just okay. We started with the accra and griot which were both tasty, and the griot was so so tender! We were split on what to order so half got the goat (far more superior) to the ox tail. I really didn't care for the oxtail. Not much flavour.  Will I be back for a full meal? Likely not, but the ambiance, cocktails and bar snacks will pull me back in.   The coleslaw condiment is outstanding. They should sell that shit!"}
{"text":"What an awesome lil spot! We went here for pre-dinner drinks and absolutely loved everything that we ordered.   For starters, we got the sat cod patty and the banana fritters. Both were delicious! For drinks, we ordered the slushies, the Wray and Ting and the Dark and Stormy. All drinks were very well made. Between the slushies - I really enjoyed the Pina Colada. Im normally not a fan of the drink but I thought I'll still give it a try and was stunned at how balanced and well made the drink was! The Daiquri was too lemony for my taste. The Dark and Stormy had a strong ginger taste - just how I like it!   I'll be back for mains and more drinks! Keep up the good work Rhum Corner!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. Mind boggling assortment of rums (full disclosure: rum's not really my booze of choice) and classic island cocktails including Mai Thai, Dark and Stormy, Cuba Libre, etc. I got the Fresco, which arrived in a charming copper mug, followed by their house slushie Daiquiri.  The food was solid if not plain -- nothing fancy, basically proteins, rice, and beans. We started with the accra, (kind of like a hush puppy) and got fish (it was bass) & oxtail for mains. Next visit I will most certainly be getting the macaroni gratin, which looked amazing.   The space is cozy with great decor. Best bathroom I've seen in awhile. (Can see how it could become uncomfortably close come late night and weekends like its sister establishments Cocktail Bar and Black Hoof)."}
{"text":"Came here with 4 friends. Awesome food and drinks. Really good service and great place to hang out.  Very cool place with nice decor with authentic food"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food, awesome place. Had the Dark & Stormy cocktail. My friend and I shared the albacore tuna ceviche, oxtail & bean sauce and cashew chicken...everything tasted oh so good and definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks while waiting for seats to free up at blackhoof. A great place to get drinks and apps! We got the plantain chips and the Mac and cheese. Plantain was decent but the Mac and cheese was one of the better ones I've ever had.  Drinks were well made too!  Good service and relatively easy to get seats.  As for value, I'd say it's ok for the price, but it is on the more expensive side."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. The vibe is good. It's not too big but not too small.   The rhum selection is off the hook and the bartenders are as smooth as silk. Been here when the weather was sweltering hot and freezing cold but the drinks are always the right temperature.   I feel like I'm in the caribe.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Griot = delicious. Oxtail = delicious. Knowledgable staff = on point. We ordered a flight of rum and the bartender gave us detailed descriptions and recommendations according to our preferences. The guys who work here are some of the friendliest I've encountered.   We also ordered the dark and stormy which I downed in...3.5 seconds.   When excellent customer service goes hand in hand with mouth-watering food, you get a happy girl and a great review."}
{"text":"Nice room-great vibe -great drinks-awesome desserts hipster Haitian the only problem is that we ordered plantains on side and then our main had the same plantains with it. Also the gratis cabbage is great but was also on our dish so...basically we had some pork stew pieces-I guess thats our fault. ribs were great id go back"}
{"text":"Cool little cozy bar on dudas west. My first time here was very pleasant however it gets really crowded and loud so it's kinda hard to talk. The music is good tho  I've tried some of  their cocktails and they're all really good. Very fruity and tropical flavours.  If you're into cocktails on def the place for it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out since it opened and finally got to do so.  My first attempt was on a Wednesday and was a huge fail.   FYI- they're closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays.    Planned to meet some friends for a drink there on Friday night around 9:00pm.  My friend got there first and was told there was a 45 minute wait so we just headed down the street to Magpie.  Around 10:30/11:00 we decided to give Rhum Corner another shot and were able to snag 3 seats at the bar.  It was packed, music was blaring and the rum was flowing.  If you're a real rum aficionado you'll appreciate the varieties of rum that they have available for your tasting pleasure.  I had a dark and stormy ($9)  and a beer (they start at $4.50 for a mug - not quite a pint).  The food menu was limited but all sounded  (and smelled)  delicious.  All in all I liked the overall vibe of the place (but note that it's more of a restaurant feel than a bar) and definitely want to come back to try the food!    **they were only accepting cash and debit on Friday night, not sure if that's the usual**"}
{"text":"yes, great girls night meal here and it feels like you're on vacation! Delicious and well priced too"}
{"text":"I've been to Rhum Corner several times.  The drinks are really tasty ---dark and stormy is one of my favourites--- and the vibe here is one of the best in the city.  they play great summery, fun and upbeat latin music that makes you happy.    Also, the washroom is one of the cleanest and nicely decorated in Toronto.  It seems like they put a lot of thought into making this place feel warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Funky I guess but pretty mediocre food. Not The Black Hoof. There are other places to get a beer in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great Place!! We dined at Rhum Corner for the first time last night and were impressed. It's got a great cozy atmosphere and the food is delicious. As other reviewers have pointed out, the presentation is not fancy, but there are still some clever touches. For example, our patties came in a small paper bag. These were not the typical jamaican style patties containing ground beef; they were filled instead with sausage, cole slaw, cucumber and beans. I had the tripe special, which was surprisingly good. My boyfriend had the oxtail, which was amazing. All the mains come with rice and beans, which is again very simple but scrumptuous. They have two blender machines with pina colada and daiquiris. I chose to try the former and was very pleased with it. Next time, I will order from the impressive menu of rums from around the caribbean and latin america."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks on a Saturday night around 10pm and we're quickly seated at the bar. Initially I was excited to have stumbled upon here as the music and ambiance seemed low key yet trendy and fun.   Partner and I ordered the rum punch which was to serve 2 people.  The bartender came by with two glasses with ice inside and opened up a bottle and poured it in the glasses. That is the rum punch. A premixed drink from a glass bottle. Not even authentic tasting.  Service is truthfully subpar. They don't seem to know basic service etiquette. I saw staff let a patron ask 4 other guests move down to the end of the bar to accommodate her party of 3. A waitress also asked us to move seats as well. Like wth seriously? That is very unprofessional to have people shuffle around like musical chairs throughout the night."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab cocktails and some Haitian small plates. Lively, hip atmosphere that makes a great addition to the trio owned by black hoof and cocktail bar folks."}
{"text":"I am upset that I wasted time and money to come to this place. My friends and I ordered 4 different dishes and we all were very unhappy with 3 of them. The only thing that tasted good was the Accra dish. I had the polenta with veggies/goat, it was terrible, it was overly salty and the flavor was just not there. My friends had 2 chicken dishes, those were gross. The amount they charge do not justify what they serve. I'm blown away by all the positive reviews. This food does not compare to real Caribbean food."}
{"text":"I don't typically don't like to post a negative review and this review is not directly related to the food. I went to this place a couple of months ago with a friend and was not drinking. I ordered a Ting. This is not a fountain drink. It is a bottle. The bartender filled the glass with ice and poured out a small amount from the bottle - but didn't give me the rest. I asked if I was not getting the bottle and he gave me a very condescending and sarcastic look with a 'no'. I paid for a bottle of Ting and had I known I wasn't getting what I paid for, I would have had water. I'm sure a bulk of the customers order rum. But just because I didn't, doesn't mean I should get ripped off. It's a shame knowing a client doesn't get a full bottle. It's almost insulting. That coupled with the cynical bartender has turned me off of this establishment for good."}
{"text":"Was referred to this place by a friend and I truly wish I was there before they stopped serving food. ( even though some small plates were offered to I assume frequent patrons or friends... no biggie)  I was told they didn't have any rice left to serve either, no biggie I'll still try the drinks. Even though the food smelled heavenly, the drinks were soooooooo fresh and refreshing. I was told per bartender to try starting off the spiced rhum ginger and oh wow!!! Amazingly fresh and delicious. Next the bartender just said \" let me make you something\" that drink was fresh tasting as well. I viewed the fresh ingredients used and I loved to see that.   Loved the whole ambiance and how  the low lighting and vibe of music flows.  I'll def will visit again but during dinner time to try the items I have heard about."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambiance is great and I've enjoyed all the drinks I've ordered here. Also, those meatballs (can't remember what they're called on the menu) are so yummy!! There's always a bit of wait but can't really fault a place for being popular. Service has always been attentive too. A waiter did forget to make a drink but he did come back with one on the house so all was good."}
{"text":"4 stars for the Macaroni au Gratin (yes! creamy cheesy carb heaven) 3 stars for service 3 stars for the oxtail and rice (the bean sauce was delicious...the oxtail, had better) 4 stars for the cabbage condiment on the table...tangy goodness! 5 stars for the ambiance.  I'll be back for the rum and good times for sure. Oh and a side of mac n cheese. Mmmm"}
{"text":"I just loved the atmosphere. All food was made to order. The whole fish was delish!!! My next visit to Toronto will require a stop here."}
{"text":"Came here because The Black Hoof was invariably full. Ordered some Fresco, macaroni & cheese, and  one other appetizer (both appetizers are not their website menu so I can't quite remember) - all of which were excellent.   They also had a sea bream fish special on that day. It was possibly the most delectable fish dish I have had in the past year."}
{"text":"There is something great about a dark and sweaty neighborhood rum bar buzzing with people from the neighborhood and the smell of fried plantains. Though we just came in for one drink it certainly left an impression. A bit outside the tourist sections of Toronto, Rhum Corner felt really local which was a good thing.   They make a mean Mai Tai and the Spiced Rhum and ginger was excellent as well.   Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One thing Jen Agg does super, super well is washrooms.  Rhum Corner's washrooms somehow smelled like coconuts.  They are always beautiful, and well designed.    We were randomly walking by, and I've had this place on my list for a while.  I usually really like Agg's restaurants.  Black Hoof and Cocktail Bar are both great, but I am a Grey Gardens hater, sadly.  I was hopeful, though, since the concept is so unlike anything else in Toronto.  First of all, the music was amazing.  I would stay and sit here, drink a slushie and listen to the music, all day.  We ended up sitting facing the street because the rest of the restaurant was incredibly warm (yay for summer!).  Service was really good, my server was really good about my hatred of cilantro, and helped me navigate the dishes and also made sure to let me know when he dropped the plates so that I wouldn't feel nervous.  Also, I made a stupid order and he helped me out so I wouldn't get 20000 bananes frites.    The drinks, as always with Agg, were the star.  OMG so good, strong, well thought out, matched well with the dishes. YUM.  We both enjoyed the food, but I'm not sure if I would rush back for it, whereas I would definitely rush back for the drinks and then happen to order a dish or two to accompany them.  All in all, so unique to Toronto and that alone makes it a gem."}
{"text":"My first time at this tropical destination was last Saturday. It's very festive. Fun music playing and a lot of atmosphere. The drinks were also fun with rum punches, tipols and cocktails served in those wee ceramic cups. Only stumbling block was some of the food. The conch fritters were a wee bit dry but maybe this is the traditional way that they are served????"}
{"text":"Really nice place to spill over to when you can't get into Black Hoof. A casual price point with great drinks. Went there in the winter time and it was a nice tropical escape from the reminder that it's freezing outside. Wish the food service stayed open later."}
{"text":"Chilly on the outside and warm on the inside.This place has some good tings going on. NOW magazine is way harsh with the meh rating. Are there lots of Hoof haters?  In some ways this spot comes off as cool and contemporary, but the overall feeling in there is pretty warm. Think string lights, bright murals, comforting flavours and friendly service (provided by the co-owner and Port-Au-Prince native, Ronald Jean, on the eve I was there). Oh, and there's the rum!   I tried: the salad, accra, red snapper with shrimp, legumes w/ goat, pikliz, wray and ting and slushy daiquiri. I'm going back for dos goat tings."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly, quick service.  We ordered Dark Oak Pale Ales, Dark and Stormys and a few 12-year-old rhums from all over South America.  The patties are AMAZING--as is the spicy slaw.  The rhum selection is legit, as is the the servers' knowledge of some good recommendations--more than I can say for a similar establishment a little eastward.  Beer is flat and bland, however.  Boo: We got an 18% surcharge for tip on our bill--totally ok bec we had over 7 people--but we weren't told about it at all and were about to tip on top of that until we double checked with the server and she was like \"oh yeah\"... kind of nasty, which was too bad."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait if you wish to be seated at a table. Lots of tasty eats some of which are Jamaican inspired. The Rum drinks are great and the staff was attentive and on the ball. Music filled the air however not loud enough to drown out conversations. All in all not bad spot to chill with friends on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Came here after a show at Sneaky Dees, was very pleasantly surprised. Fantastic rum collection and the service was friendly and efficient. The place was packed for 9:30pm and the bf and I were worried we wouldn't be able to get a a seat for half an hour at least, but the hostess greeted us right away and informed us there's a table paying their check so the table will be ready shortly. I ordered the pins colada (reminded me of Cuba) and the bf got a Frangelic, a fruity rum shaved ice drink served in a copper cup; I wasn't a fan of the spicy herbal notes in the drink, but the bf enjoyed it. We also ordered the banana fritters and the Accra fritters. YOU MUST ORDER THE ACCRA!  It was phenomenally delicious, the perfect balance between the crispy exterior and a flavourful, creamy centre. Paired with the dipping sauce and bites of the jalapeño cole slaw (if only they sell it by the bucket...) they were heavenly! The banana fritters were a bit on the saltier side and doesn't have much flavour on it's own, would be better ordered as an accompaniment to a saucy dish. The crowning glory of our evening was the Zombie; this drink arrived pink, frosty, atop with blue flames. It's sweet, fruity, and you can taste how heavily fortified with alcohol it is. With all the layers of flavour, I didn't mind the cinnamon note in the drink. This drink hits you hard after 15 mins or so; guess that's why it's called the Zombie. Definitely worth checking out, I'll be back to try the entrees; I've got my eyes on the oxtail and the fried fish for two."}
{"text":"Ambiance and service is everything. I've been here a few times but only for drinks. Really busy on the weekend! Great date spot!"}
{"text":"The reason why I tried this place is because a friend of mine recommended it to me.  We were a group of 5 and luckily, we got a table right away.  Service: The service and staff was awesome! Our server was very attentive (I don't remember her name because it was quite loud). I also spilled water on the table and someone went to our table and cleaned it right away, plus giving me a fresh glass of water. Our server knew the menu items and described all the dishes in a professional yet mouthwatering way!  Atmosphere/Location: It's a hidden gem. It is right beside black hoof. The atmosphere was very dark with candle lights but very festive.   Price: I would say the alcohol was pretty expensive. We ordered a pina colada ($8), mojito ($10), Monster ($23, drink for 2)  Food: OH BOY, IT WAS DELICIOUS!! Normally, I'm a type of person that only eats basic protein. My friend recommended these dishes: *** ALL mains come with banana frites:  - Pork Ribs: comes with 3 pieces, rice and banana frites, very tender, decent portion - Ox Tail and Bean Sauce: Can't describe it other than it's super delicious! - Legumes with Goat: A lot of bones but hey the sauce that comes with it is absolutely yummy! - Whole Fried Fish: huge portion!! We finished it all. Very crispy and cooked perfectly. Seasoned well and I love the onions on top. They don't overpower the dish.  - Griot (Street Style): Good starter and decent portion as well  Dessert: There is only one option but we ordered the rum cake. The cake was really moist and there is a compote on top to add sweetness and create balance in the dish.   Overall, I am a happy customer. It's not something that I would eat everyday but I find their dishes very hearty and more of comfort food. Will definitely come back!  Oh and for 5 people who ordered an alcoholic beverage, our total was roughly 175+ but we paid $40 each person including tip."}
{"text":"Wow the ambience is great. The food is so tasty and delicious. I will definitely be back.  Food: whole fried fish- amazing Oxtail- so much flavour and tasty that I wanted to order another plate Chicken- tasty  Cons: drinks are pretty small sizes for the price. But they are tasty as well.  Did I mention that the food is unreal!! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Dinner was a no brainer here when I saw the menu. I mean, who could resist such a deliciously described Accra and that the had goat on the menu. GOAT.  So yes, I got the goat before it could get mine. (bad pun, yes) And it was deliciously fall-off-the-bone and draped over a silky polenta-esque base. Awesomeness on a plate.  The dark & stormy I ordered was a citrusy-gingery mix that brought to mind tropical beaches that weren't dark and stormy. A far cry from the slow, creeping chill of Toronto's weather.  The decor was warm, inviting and friendly. The staff were the same.  I'd definitely come back here and just hang out at the bar the next time I decide to trek up to the great white north."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews but... I was highly disappointed after eating at Rhum Corner. I'm Haitian American. Both of my parents were born in Haiti so I am very familiar with Haitian food. However, the food they serve at Rhum Corner is NOT Haitian food. You can't just make red kidney beans and rice and call it Haitian food. I guess since most of the patrons that frequent Rhum Corner have never had Haitian food so they don't know the difference, but I do. I was interested in having the cashew chicken with rice. When I asked the waiter what kind of rice is served with the chicken he just said \"seasoned\". In Haitian cuisine we have many kinds of rice so replying by saying \"seasoned\" doesn't differentiate anything because all of our foods are seasoned. I tried asking my question to another waitress and she didn't know either. I ordered the cashew chicken anyway and realized it came with diri kole and two fried plantain. The chicken and rice wasn't bad, it just wasn't Haitian by any means. Also the portions were small. I recommend the owners buy Haitian products to make these dishes like a Haitian brand cooking rice such as Madame Gougousse or Haitian Princess and Maggi bouillon cubes. It makes a huge difference.  Also, I see a lot of reviewers talk about the drinks being good. I did not order a drink, maybe that would've made my experience better."}
{"text":"Silvia's review is ridiculous. The servers at Rhum Corner are always exceptional.. and get over yourself; if you sit at the bar, just be relaxed and accommodating. She probably also thinks the place has a cool Cuban vibe."}
{"text":"This is the best cocktail bar/restaurant in Toronto IMHO (and I've been to some good ones)! Their cocktails were refreshing, bright, and delicious. And their food is equally good and perfectly seasoned! I recommend the Griot for a snack and their version of a Dark n' Stormy called the \"Spiced Rhum and Ginger.\" The cucumber shiso daiquiri was also very good!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place does Haitian less controversially than some (see: today's piece in The Atlantic \"Arcade Fire Exploited Haiti, and Almost No One Noticed\") but not as well as I'd hoped.  Our party of 5 arrived at 6PM on a Saturday and there was plenty of room; we sat in the cozy back booth under the neon sign. I don't remember what was in this space before but I doubt it was half as good-looking.  BEVVIES: All tiny but boozy. The Dark & Stormy ($9) is the largest of the bunch in a petite highball glass. Dainty but dangerous little slushies of the Daiquiri ($7) and Pina Colada ($8) varieties were both major hits of the evening and impossible to consume slowly or sensibly. The Negroni was that night's drink special, which turned out to be $11 and just okay.  SNACKS: I loooved the accra ($5), finger-sized malanga [starchy root plant] fritters with a yummy milky dip and giving latkes a run for their money. Sadly, they came only five to a plate. The salt cod patty ($4) was certainly a step up from Patty King...maybe not three dollars up...but good! My friend ordered a wildly overpriced and undersized watercress salad ($8) - enough said. I wasn't really into the table's Pikliz (spicy pickled cabbage) but the flavour is worth a try.  PLATES: The mains are small plates, so they're not exactly a steal. A couple of us had the tasty Red Snapper with Shrimp ($12) but a more apt name might be Rice and More Pikliz with Two Shrimps and Some Fish In There Somewhere If You Can Find It. The fish was tasty though. Our friends ordered the turkey leg ($11) and legumes with goat ($11), noting that the latter was \"waaaay better\".  Caribbean cuisine is known to be seasoned liberally but everything, apps included, was too loaded with salt and vinegar for me. I guess that's where those slushies come in. We had another round of drinks and an ice cream, too - the menu's lone dessert.  BATHROOMS: If you're renovating your home, the wallpaper du jour is apparently \"Full-Frontal Naked Sexy Haitians\".  In summation: I'm delighted about the addition of a cool \"Manje Kreyòl\" spot to the city, but we all agreed that the drinks are the best part. Bring a wad of cash and come for those - the name says it all, anyhow."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!!  There mac n cheese is delicious!! But they stop serving food at midnight :(  Love all their rum cocktails!!! They have this run punch for two that I always get, and their slushy negroni is also yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, cocktails and service in here. We tried the crunchy little starter bites - very good! Cashew chicken was tasty and rice and peas great - the ribs even better, delicious and amazingly tender. Excellent dark n stormys and fantastic wray and ting. Only minor point was that tax was not included which necessitated a trip to the ATM!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for drinks on Saturday.  Arrived early enough to be able to get a table--by 8:30 there was a considerable line up.  Ordered apps to start banana frites, Accra and the Chicken patty.  The Accra was my favorite of the 3 reminded me of seasoned breadfruit.  Banana frites are salty, crunchy and pare well with the rum based drinks.  Chicken patty was just ok-my least fave.    The dark n stormy I had was excellent you can tell they use quality mixers it had a strong ginger beer as its base which I like but not so strong that your coughing from the ginger aftertaste.  For a main I had the fish served with rice & peas(beans) portion was on the small side served on rustic tin style plates.  Fish was well cooked however had a strong odor which could be remedied by liming the fish prior to cooking.  Rice and beans were ok.   Loved the pickled cabbage served with the mains very tasty stuff.  Great place to stop by for apps and drinks, decor is creative.  Music was at a moderate level when we arrived then was turned up so high as the tables were filled we could only shout at each other across the table--too loud.  Staff are efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a place to bring a friend or two or three, order the whole menu and try all the cool Haitian food. The cocktails were tasting, the atmosphere is intimate and the service was great. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Can't really say because it was packed Saturday night and didn't want to wait but I would like to check it out another time. The menu of food and drinks sounds intriguing"}
{"text":"Great and fun place for delicious bites and good Rhum cocktails !! The only small minus was the music getting too loud towards our end of the Friday evening, like 11pm but that's understandable! Prices are reasonable and service is GOOD!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Love the fun servers. Love the washroom. Love the rum. Love the cocktails. Overall, lovely date spot - very cozy.  Was thinking about hitting up Hoof Bar and Cocktail Bar as well, but this place was comfortable enough for us not to go hopping around."}
{"text":"I am Haitian . Both my mother and father were born in Haiti , I myself I was raised in Haiti. I can say that the food was good I was a bit disappointed there is not a bigger Haitian presence. I could not find any Haitian waiters, nor was the food truly authentic although tasty. I feel for the price more effort should be put towards purchasing Haitian products to truly give the Haitian experience. Nevertheless it's Haitian owner so I will be back as often as possible in hopes to support and suggest a more indulgent Haitian experience. Ayiti Cheri"}
{"text":"food can be hit and miss, but most of the time it's pretty fantastic. salt cod patties are simple, cheap and quality, as are the mains. I've found some off-tempurature centres though. Rum selection is great, delicious mixed drinks. great service."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Friday night around 7pm, but boy did it get even busier the whole time we were there. Met two of my best friends for some time on dundas west. Nabbed 3 seats at the front window as the previous group was leaving. Service was great and personable, drinks were recommended and ordered. (Dark & Stormy and nice glass of red)  For food we picked: Fried Accra (came with addcitive spicy slaw... mouth is drooling) Oxtail with rice and friend plantains (Flavorful, the purple bean sauce was delicious)  All in all with the music and environment was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in the city to eat and drink at. Out of every cocktail the dark and stormy was the best in my opinion and each dish was packed with perfect flavor and texture. Amazing food. The service is great. Everyone is polite and helpful. The pictures show the ceviche with plantain and griot (indescribably delicious) also holy Crap their pork ribs are the best ribs I think I've ever had. You will not be disappointed. Music is bomb too, soo good"}
{"text":"Run by the Black Hoof next door this is a must visit after dinner.  Really cool visually, it takes you away to a different place and time.  The drinks are amazing, try them all. The food takes it to another level with dishes you wouldn't expect in Canada. The fritters are out of this world, and paired with the slaw were perfect.  Cashew chicken was the caribbean on a plate. Come here to eat or drink."}
{"text":"This is the new spot from the owner of The Black Hoof. It's a great concept - celebrate the food and drink of the Caribbean. There are places devoted to bourbon, scotch and tequila. Now add rum to the list!  As expected, they have a lot of different kinds of rum from a lot of different places.  We went on Saturday night and sat at the bar - it wasn't crowded when we arrived but by 9PM the place was full. Tables were occupied by large groups enjoying bottles of rum with coke and lime. We enjoyed some rum drinks and delicious food. The banana fritters were addictive - we ordered more. Definitely want to go back to try the goat and everything else on the menu. Delicious. Nice vibe. Will be back in the colder months to pretend I am somewhere warm."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to realize. It just hit me that this might be one of my favourite places in the city. I can't explain but it's a special combination of the Haitian rhythms they have playing, the mural on the walll, incredible drinks, the gorgeous bathroom, lovely staff...i could go on. Just totally my kind of place. I feel transported.   I love the Dark and Stormy, Accra, and Goat + Legumes (w/ polenta). Oh god, my idea of heaven."}
{"text":"My favorite gastronomic experience while visiting Toronto. Service was just as good as the food; friendly, forthcoming, fast. I tried the frescos - and let me tell y'all... You shouldn't leave this place without at least trying one (or two). Shaved ice, a sweet syrup, and rum. Mmhmm. I also got to make an honorific mention to the atmosphere and music selection; Haitian tunes grooving, dim lights... Love this place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that is worth rediscovering again and again. This place rocks on so many levels.  From the ambiance and the friendly staff to the amazing food and reasonable prices...Rhum Corner got it all right!   Definitely order their Accra - it's some kind of root vegetable mashed, then formed into a croquette then fried and tossed with a bit of salt.  They are addictive as ever and you will find yourself ordering plate after plate.   Other must orders include their banana frites (savoury not sweet), macaroni gratin (generous helping of cheese and cream with a breadcrumb topping for just the right amount of texture) and ox tail entree (brilliantly braised served with white rice and a black bean sauce to die for).   Finally the turkey leg entree is a must try.  The leg is braised to perfection where the meat is falling off the bone and served with black rice expertly seasoned with mushroom broth (I think) and Maggi sauce - can you say YUMMY?  Bottom line: excellent food with a small but brilliantly executed menu with non-pretentious prices.  What's not to love about this place?  Tip: Double check your bill.  They made a $200 mistake on ours."}
{"text":"Came here for some pre-drinks before dinner with a few friends.  Luckily we managed to get seating at the bar for all of us.  This place is tiny - bordering on claustrophobic for me - I felt squished in.  It's dark, it's cozy and it's lively and loud here!    You want to try and discover new rums?  Come here!  You want to get some knowledge about rums?  Come here!  Basically I think everyone should check this place out with the intention of trying out some new brands.  Once you've had a good quality rum you will never go back to the cheap stuff.  It goes down smooth, like velvet...instead of a 3rd degree burn.  The service as many others have mentioned is a bit lackluster.  I know they are busy but we waited awhile for our bill, even asking for it twice.  Since we were on a time crunch and had dinner reservations we ended up going to the back to pay at the small counter.    I'd go back in the summer, maybe at an off peak time when it isn't so slammed to try some more of their libations."}
{"text":"Delicious Rum selection and expert mixology on all the drinks. It's the real deal for cocktails. The bartenders were a lot of fun and were expert entertainers. I felt really  welcome. These guys are chefs with those cocktails! I want one right now."}
{"text":"Great Haitian Vibe. We had snacks and it reminds me of home. Food taste good. And that haitian music tho. On point! Kitchen closes at midnight. Good service. Really nice place. The only thing is that the drinks portions are really small for the prices. But they're so good!"}
{"text":"It's 10:30 pm on a Sunday night, and I'm looking for a place to eat. No better place to turn to than yelp to see what's currently open and well rated. a few places pop up, but Rhum Corner stood out to me, as I have frequented the black hoof and Jen Agg's spin-offs in the past and felt that it would be a safe choice.  When I first heard that Jen and husband Roland Jean were closing the raw bar for a haute cuisine carribean restaurant and rum bar, I was skeptical. but the reviews have come in favourably, and so, it was finally time to check it out.  for drinks, my table and I all got the Dark and Stormy based on some of the reviews on yelp and the overall description on the menu. As promised, it delieverd in all aspects. Great ginger beer base, and balance of all ingredients.  I got the Griot (Fried pork shoulder, with fried plaintain), and the Accra (a fried dumplings of sorts, similar to fried taro that you get at chinese dim sum) for the table to start. both dishes were delicious, and perfect for sharing.  For the main, I got the oxtail which came with white rice, a bean gravy sauce, and tostones. The dish itself was great, but what really put it over the top was the hot sauce that they gave us on the side. whooooo. Not sure what it consisted of, but it tasted like smokey scotch bonnet peppers and some vinegar. If you like heat with your food, definitely ask for it, and throw it on.  Aside from the food and drinks, I really liked the atmosphere. It reminded me of little cafes or bars I would go to when travelling through South America. dimly lit, tunes in the background, and an overall feeling of relaxation. I would definitley recommend taking friends here to catch up over drinks, or on a nice night out with the significant other."}
{"text":"Mmmm rum cocktails so divine, I want to drink them all the time!  I had the lovely honour of being taken out on a date here and was treated to two delicious cocktails: a pina colada and a dark and stormy. Both of these drinks were incredible! Let's start with the pina colada. This is not one of those over-the-top ginormous pina coladas with umbrellas and skewers of fruit, no my friend, this is a grown-up pina colada, a small but strong enough serving that hits the spot just right. It basically just tastes like pure coconut blended up, which is perfectly fine by me. The accent of one single maraschino cherry is just enough to leave that sugary sweet taste trail. Everything about this pina colada is perfect. I was worried it would be too much, but it was honestly the most adorable size. Goldilocks would approve. Recommend!  On to the Dark and Stormy, I like ginger beer but I don't love ginger beer, but I did love whatever ginger beer Rhum Corner uses to mix their drinks. What was interesting is how they pour their Dark and Stormy's out of a tap. I was mesmerized as I watched the bartender meticulously slice a thin lime wheel for each drink with the precision and patience of a surgeon, then place it gently and perfectly at the top of each glass.  I was here on a Thursday night and this place was busy, crowded and loud. We ended up with a seat at the bar, which was great. As you probably guessed, we were there for drinks so I can't comment on the food, but service was friendly and efficient. Can't wait to go back and drink all of the rum!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Loved the atmosphere (great music, the beautiful painting, the washroom). Made me feel I was outside of Toronto.  Definitely try the accra. Amazing little fritters.  The main courses were great as well. Loved the vinegary bell peppers on the fish dish.  And of course you need to try the drinks. Dark and stormy, amazing. The pina colada (tastes just like what you'd get on a resort down south), which is what I've been looking for all around Toronto and finally I have found my place.  Service was great as well.   My only complaint: The \"slaw\" gets a little annoying as it seems to be on all the plates that you get, when you have a big jar next to you. Doesn't make sense to me. And some of the items on the menu seem to appear on other dishes. But I guess it's necessary as it is a puny \"kitchen\" and if the place gets busy, would be difficult to uphold a vast menu.   A nice experience, check it out.    ps: loved the washroom tiles."}
{"text":"Cool bar, great music, fun staff, super accommodating, then WHY THE ONE STAR? The bartender was so super rude, he yelled at me for using 'his' coke.. When i order a rum and coke and they put the 355mL bottle next to me and the rum i ordered, i sort of think its mine.. When i added more to my strong drink, he told me not to touch HIS coke... Apparently, that wasn't part if my purchase... The entire coke... So then he could have just said so and not yelled at me!"}
{"text":"Popped in late on a \"pan Am\" evening. Ossington and Dundas buzzing as always. Good vibe. Loud. Friendly and attentive staff. Tasty Haitian inspired food. The whole fish was the highlight for me. Goat with polenta was solid. Just like at the Hoof the cocktails are top notch."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have this fun spot in my new neighbourhood.  You walk into a very casual space, with slightly overly loud music, but that's OK, it's part of the vibe.  The hostess is always on point and very welcoming, and the vibe is nice.    The PIÑA COLADA is amazing.  I've almost never liked the syrupy white stuff that ends up in my glass at other restaurants, but here the frozen piña colada tastes like actual pineapples and coconuts were harmed in the making of it!  At $8 it's refreshing and boozy, a definite winner.  In terms of other drinks, they do some reasonable to pricey cocktails.  Their beer is $5.50 per pour...I don't call it a pint, because despite not being specified on the menu, there was no way it was anywhere near a pint in volume.  Boring beers too.  Lots of rare rums on the menu, but didn't investigate pricing.  The FOOD is tasty.  I've tried the cashew chicken and the goat with legumes.  First off, ignore the server that tells you to order 2 snacks and a plate.  Unless you're training for some sort of eating competition, that's just silly.  I couldn't even finish the portion size of one plate.  Even the snacks are pretty big...2 people could subsist on 3-4 snacks even.  The goat with legumes was packed with flavour...the rather small bits of bone left in it was a bit amateurish though.    OVERALL, really a fun and nice place for a casual bite and a tasty beverage."}
{"text":"Rhum Corner is a keeper. In line with the Black Hoof ethos of bang for buck this place offers a great dining experience. I've never had Haitian food before so can't comment on authenticity, but the food was delicious. Good portion sizes and prices. We got all the mains and a bunch of appies. Basically, listen to your server for they will mot lead you astray. Can't wait to eat here again.   Oh, and def. Do the bottles of rum. Excellent dark and stormies."}
{"text":"Great no frills rum cocktails and good caribbean food. I don't like tostones as much as most people but for whatever reason their tostones (fried plantain chips) are just better than most. We also shared their meatballs beans and rice platter which I thought was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try different kinds of rum cocktails. The servers were very helpful and friendly.  I had the Dark and Stormy rum drink with ginger and sushi tuna salad and fried plantains. Drinks and food were delicious.  The environment was dark and mellow. R&b, hip hop and Spanish music. The washrooms were shared by men and women. You use whatever stall is available and u share the sink to wash your hands. It was decorated very well."}
{"text":"Came to check out this spot the week after it opened, so I was really excited to see what this place had to offer.  The mood inside is dark and inviting. I felt like I was on vacation, right away. The ambiance is great, put together with good music, hanging lights, brick walls, wooden stools, the large beautiful picture or painting of what seems to be a king and queen.  Onto the even better stuff: You can buy rum by the bottle for the table ($25 for a 1/4 bottle, $100 for the whole bottle). We got a 1/4 bottle of rum, some appetizers and it was well priced. Loved the fried plantain and coconut ice cream dessert, seriously super good.  Definitely am coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends and we ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu and shared it. It was absolutely amazing - the Mac & cheese was my absolute favourite and I loved the decor of the place. Definitely recommend going here for something different."}
{"text":"Very upbeat and happy vibe. They serve the rhum in bottles that you can pour yourself and mix with single serve glass bottles of coke - no diet coke available unfortunately. Owner was there and overheard it was our birthday so sent along some premium rum for us to enjoy. We'll definitely be back and would be nice to try the food."}
{"text":"So I was in Toronto for about a week and had tried so many different spots and types of foods. On my last day, this is where I went..... BEST DECISION EVER!!! I walked about 40 minutes here from my hotel (didn't know any better). But glad I burned some of the calories I was about to ingest!   The setting is really nice. I'm Haitian and I was really happy to see a place that kept the integrity of our culture and was still able to share it with others in a way they can enjoy! I walked in and Haitian music was being blasted, drinks were being served, people were talking having a blast, and eating amazing food.   The first thing I ordered was a drink. I got the Spiced Rum + Ginger. That was really good. For a bar/restaurant, it's nice to have a place that has really tasty but strong drinks! After that I ordered the griot as an appetizer. I loved it! It was extremely moist, which can be hard to do with griot. It was a little bit on the salty side, but still very enjoyable. They had little jars of piklíz all over the place. And I loved it! To see and eat, haha. To go, I got the boulette entre (seasoned meatballs). Usually, they are fried and this was the first time I had them in sauce. It was a surprise to me when I opened the box. But man! I'm glad I went with it cause boy was it good! I loved that they also had their own hot sauces. I bought 3 bottles to go just because they were so good and hot! It's like piklíz in a bottle.   On top of the great food, my server was also amazing! Very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient! I don't remember her name, but it was cool they hired someone very familiar with the culture.  I highly recommend this place. If you live in Toronto or are there for a visit, it's a really nice place to go."}
{"text":"I am not sure what they put in the drink \"Zombie\", but if the taste is anywhere as good as how it feels to be a zombie, I would want to be in The Walking Dead. This drink is absolutely delicious and a great way to start the night!  We got the \"Oxtail with rice, gravy, and tostones\", \"Legumes and goat over polenta\", \"Pork Ribs, \"Fried pork shoulder and fried plantains\", \"A Whole Fish\" and a couple other dishes. Needless to say, we definitely had a great night. The place gives off a unique and yet cozy vibe. All the dishes were quite good and the price is very reasonable. The dessert was a Rhum cake and it was the sweetest way to end the night. This is definitely a good place to bring friends after a long day at work to relax and enjoy some comfort food!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! First time trying Haitian food...this was an experience to die for. Great service & the waiting staff were able to explain what was on the menu & popular customer choices. I would recommend this hidden gem - can't wait to return asap!"}
{"text":"Cool spot I've been a few times. If you can think of a rum they are likely to have it. The bartenders also really know what they are doing."}
{"text":"The accra and whole fish are soooo good.  They also make a mean dark & stormy.  Service was very friendly but a bit slow.  My only complaint is the slightly high price given the simplicity of the food."}
{"text":"I am having a really hard time rating this place mostly because I grew up eating most of these menu items at home and have gone to countless Haitian restaurant including some in Haiti. Some major differences would include the prices (which are quite high for typical Haitian food and the portions),  the decor, which in this case feature art from the owner Haitian husband and the fact that not one person working in the kitchen or on staff speak Creole (this was a deal breaker for my dad to come try this place!) That being said the effort is there and unless you are used to these menu items you will for the most part leave with a happy tummy... here's the breakdown:  Most people are surprised to hear that Haitian food isn't typically spicy.. chalk it up to the french influence but we love our carbs, rich flavours, and sauces! And I guess that was the one big complaint I had overall about Rhum Corner there are virtually no traditional sauces to accompany any of their dishes... where is the ti-malice, sauce pois noir or meat sauce?   The griot was what I was really excited to try and I think they missed the mark. First off they trimmed way too much fat off the pork (which is where most of the flavour comes from) and inexplicably added a sweet sauce to the mix to help compensate for the lack of moisture in the meat (again from taking away the fat). Haitian food is not sweet and we generally don't mix salty and sweet together, so although it didn't taste too bad, but real griot is AMAZING and this re-invention falls quite short.  I would also pass on the pikliz, which is our cabbage slaw. This table top condiment was way too vinegary and I have a feeling it's because it sits in an open container at room temperature all day instead of remaining crisp and slightly spicy as it should.  My favourite items were the Accra and banan pezé generally speaking they did a great job both with taste and texture. At the end of the day I've decided to give Rhum corner 3 stars because although not all it's menu items tasted particularly inspired, I like the idea of people perhaps going home and learning a bit more about Haitian food and culture. Also as a bar this place is pretty great."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan.  Rhum Corner's the newest offering from the folks behind the Black Hoof and Cocktail Bar; their third restaurant in the area, I'm convinced they're set on slowly taking over the entire city block.  I have no problem with that if it means we keep getting restaurants and watering holes of this caliber.  Jenn Agg seems determined to build a culinary paradise one dumpy heritage building at a time, and Toronto's richer for it.  My first visit to Rhum Corner was on their opening weekend, where I experienced no hiccups, great service, and perfect small plates while we were waiting for a reservation at Yours Truly.  I returned to solo it a couple weeks later, and once again received excellent service.  Two days after that I took a friend, and as usual everything was impeccable.  Look, I'm not generally a pina colada kind of guy.  I like my cocktails molecular and innovative, or classic and dating back to prohibition.  If it's got bourbon I'm probably sold.  If it's got a folding umbrella I'm going to do everything I can to contain my disgust and not drive the pointy end through your eye, throat, or eardrum.  But damn.  That pina colada.  Rhum Corner offers a narrow menu of well-priced and expertly mixed cocktails, and the pina colada's a standout.  This is not the overly-sweet, embarrassingly unrefined beverage you'll order at a Jack Astor's or something.  The team here knows their stuff, and they do not mess around.  The pina colada's well balanced, refreshing, and at eight bucks there's just nothing here to argue with.  The daiquiri's another balanced offering that should please a refined tippler, or anyone looking to get their Hemingway on.  The Dark and Stormy's simply the best I've ever had, anywhere.  The ginger's deliciously strong, and the flavor profile's deep enough to give you something to think about.  The Wray and Ting's solid, but for my tastes wasn't as good as the other three cocktails.  I know next to nothing about rum, but my more rum-enabled dining companions have made favorable comments about the vast selection.  I don't know if there's another bar in Toronto with such a breadth of choice.  I've yet to hit any of their mains, but all the small plates are just amazing drinking food.  The Bananes Frites are crispy, chewy, and immensely salty - perfect to pair with a sweet frozen cocktail.  The Accra's delicious, accompanied by a peppery slaw and like the Frites, perfect for sopping up alcohol.  Both are fried to perfection with hardly a trace of grease; everything's light, but satisfying.  The Salt Cod Patty's flavorful and memorable, bridging the gap between snack and main.  Nothing I've had at Rhum Corner is particularly complicated or layered, but everything's executed perfectly and the flavors are all spot on.  It's a great place to just grab a couple drinks and chat, or to burn 45 minutes as you wait for a table elsewhere.  The service is impeccable and the whole place really hit the ground running.  The Black Hoof team has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto last month for a couple of days. My sister and I stumbled in this place for a drink. I loved how diverse they were with their drink drink selection. Rum and beers from different countries. The decor was gorgeous, the background music was excellent and our waitress was so well mannered and friendly. If ever I'm back in the Toronto area, I will definately try their food menu."}
{"text":"I really like Rhum Corner. I just happen to like the Hoof more, so I rarely end up here. The Dark and Stormys are killer, though, as is the accra and griot."}
{"text":"Having finally been, I'm bummed it took me so long to walk through the doors of this charming and delicious Dundas West spot. I had stayed away thinking I wouldn't be able to find much in the way of vegetarian-friendly fare. I think I was lumping it in with the other Jen Agg owned spot, Black Hoof, which is very veg-unfriendly. Turns out Rhum Corner has more than enough on its menu to satisfy both the veggiesaurus and meatasuarus in your life.   They don't take reservations, but my party of three walked in around 8:30pm on a Tuesday and were sat immediately at a cozy little table. We each ordered a cocktail (two Rhum Negroni slushies and a Mai Tai) and set out making our decisions. We basically took on half the snack menu, which is all the vegetarian options they have, but its more than enough for three people to share for a light-ish dinner. About 15 minutes later our items started to arrive: bananes frites, accra fritters with pikliz, macaroni au gratin, and rice n'beans. Everything was delicious and satisfying and I was still stuffed hours later. Our tart and somewhat bitter cocktails were the perfect balance to all the hearty food.   Also worth nothing is the space itself. There has been meticulous attention paid to the decor, glassware, and even the custom stamp used for the takeout containers. Its the kind of thing that welcomes you right away but doesn't feel staged. A difficult balance to strike, but well done here."}
{"text":"Lots of fun at this place. I love that you can order straight up rum and coke and even order half bottles of rum. Really great spot for a decent sized group. Their ceviche was unbelievable as well."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry and stopped in here for a quick bite. Had the patty, the goat and the pork ribs along with a dark and stormy. I am not usually a fan of goat but it was my favourite dish. Everything was delicious. Super-laid back vibe. Very casual. We will definitely be back. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Came in for drinks with a few friends and loved it here. Beautiful little spot in the dt area. Great music and ambiance. Kitchen closes by 10pm so don't go too late If you are hungry."}
{"text":"Aside from a few dishes, I've really never had Haitian food, so I can't speak to the authenticity. I can, however, speak to knowing how to have a fun time with good food, and Rhum Corner certainly delivered.   I really enjoyed the Dark and Stormy, and my goat dinner was fabulous. It's one of these typical Toronto places where the cocktails are the same price as the mains. You know the drill, about $70 for a dinner for two, but you leave a bit wobbly and it's worth every penny.   The decor is divine, and whisked me away to the warm and fuzzies of sitting on a beach with a mai tai in one hand and a cigar in the other... only with more goat. Gotta love more goat."}
{"text":"Rhum Corner is the place to be in Toronto. Just north of West Queen West, it's on a street with several great cocktail bars (Like Cocktail Bar across the street). The theme is casual Haitian and it's so awesome. The staff is friendly and they make GREAT cocktails and food. If you like sweet drinks, order the fresco. The mac and cheese is on point as a snack!"}
{"text":"A great place to get 'rum and dumber'! Start with a Zombie and enter the land of the walking dead. Bar snacks are great and provide that much needed sustenance when you have a belly full of booze. Staff is awesome and the tunes and surroundings can make you forget about winter, if the drinks haven't already."}
