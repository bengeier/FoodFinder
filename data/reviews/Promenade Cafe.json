{"text":"I'm still fairly new to Northwest Las Vegas and I am missing being able to have a Mediterranean meal.  The server suggested that I try the Pomegranate chicken.  Oh my!  It was the best!  I've never heard of it before.  The restaurant is very clean, portions are generous and all who work there are very friendly!  I would suggest you try this place soon!"}
{"text":"If  you're looking for a late night breakfast place, chalk off the Promanade Cafe at the Rampart.   Upon being seated we specifically asked the bus person, for fresly brewed decaf, what we got instead was cold coffee that had been sitting in a thermal pot for several hours.  We sent it back.  The second time around  we got  coffee from the same pot but this time it had been reheated and it was burnt.   We finally gave up on the decaf and ordered regular coffee which was not great, but acceptable. When I'm shelling out  $2.25 for coffee, I expect it to be fresh.   I noticed the place was empty, except for a  couple that was seated shortly after us.  A half hour after we ordered we were still waiting for our food.  When we realized the other couple finished eating and left  we complained to the server who suddenly decided to find out about the delay.  Obvisously, the cook was sending us a message.  I heard it loud and clear, but my husband was hungry and insisted we stay. Realizing the cook was seeking retribuation I barely touched my food, even though I was starving. We've had problems during the graveyard shift in the past. Obviously, they lose money  by staying open and upper management could care less about what goes on. After complaining, we were comped , but our evening was ruined so who cares."}
{"text":"This is at the J.W.Marriott at the Rampart casino off Rampart blvd. Near Summerlin Parkway.  Just on the outskirts of Summerlin. The thing I love about this place is I always feel young every time I go because most of the customers are between 60-90years old. It seems like the social networking area for them when they get out to gamble. You see families also, nice atmosphere. The great thing is though most of the waitresses are long beyond their prime, they are very pleasant. A few times though I have had absentee waitress and had to go looking for them I figured they were taking a nap! But the food is good, large portions, we have stayed at the Marriott and dined here before right after being at the pool and in tank tops, shorts and thongs, so its very casual, nobody really cares.  There are approximately 6 TV plasmas mounted with usually sports or news playing. Booth and table seating, no more than a 5 min wait typically.  I really like it, my kids like it they have nice deserts,  nice portions and friendly people. The only thing is service can be very slow if you get a slower moving waitress over 70 yrs old,what can you expect! It's sweet they are still working. I respect that, so I try to tip them well and cut them some slack. I too will be old one day...They do a good job for there age! So, if you can stomach all that... you will love the food they have a great special weekly, either steak 8oz. and lobster or steak and shrimp 3 course meal for only $9.99 can't be bad, the restaurants down the street are charging $29.99! So put the coin in your pocket and maybe use it on the slots for a nice time out!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap! Fantastic for the price! Ate here about 6 times throughout my stay! Try the steak!"}
{"text":"Food OK, Service Horrible Come here about every other month. Food and service was always adequate by the standard of an average coffee shop in Las Vegas. Our visit on 4-27-14 could be our last. Food is still ok, other than the fact their cook (definitely not qualify as a chef), did not know (or not care) about what customers requested. Four of us all ordered prime ribs - one medium well, one medium, and two medium rare. It came out all the same - RARE. Before we had a chance to have one of them to be cooked a little bit more (not difficult - just put it in the Au Jus for a little while), our waitress already disappeared (she gave us our check when the main course arrived) and never suraced again. So service was horrible. Even the hostess did not ask how was everything (afraid to?). It is a shame this cafe shop is associated with the Marriott resort in Summerlin."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at this place.  Don't count on any fresh food.  In my party, it was easy to tell that most of the food came from cans or boxes (including the mashed potatoes).  Meats and vegetables were overcooked and flavorless.  The service was not much better.  Over the course of an hour dinner, our waiter changed 3 times due to breaks.  The waiter of the minute never knew what anybody was drinking.  I would only recommend this place if you are already at the Rampart Casino and you are dying of hunger."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and the waitress brought bacon instead of sausage, but the worst was the biscuits that tasted like they'd been freezer burned. What kind of restaurant puts biscuits in the freezer until they get that nasty? Maybe they thought the gravy would mask the flavor. In any event, this is a poor restaurant. Wish I hadn't chosen it for Father's Day."}
{"text":"My experience with this cafe is that it is mainly geared towards seniors with small servings, cheap prices and mediocre food. Although my company of great family made this experience better this restaurant seemed like the step child of rampart casino. Our server was great, his name was Anthony and he was as attentive as he could be."}
{"text":"Only good for breakfast; they can handle the morning rush but that's about it. Lunch and dinner options, while varied, fall short of expectations - bland food and low quality ingredients. Service also follows the same path."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible here! They are so incredibly under prepared for the people who stay in this hotel. We come to this hotel every two years and I think, \"it has to be better this time.\" No...it doesn't get better. There is a ton of open tables, the wait staff is terribly slow, and we have been waiting for 45 minutes now for a table!! The sad part is that at 9:45 PM, this is the only option for a hot meal. JW Marriott, please get it together...you know how many people are staying at your property and you clearly don't care."}
{"text":"A super late post of my visit at Promenade Cafe inside JW Marriott.  We visited earlier this year.  Both hubby and I were hungry @ 6 in the morning but didn't want room service.  Went downstairs to see what they got and Promenade Cafe opens 24/7.  It was busy already at 6 in the morning.    The waitress was attentive and smiley (@ 6? geeze but I like that).  We ordered a smoked salmon bagel, vegetable omelet with avocado, a side of a waffle and white toast :)  All were fresh and delicious.  My only issue was that I had to request to be reseated somewhere away from the slot machines; those gamblers were smoking their lungs out!"}
{"text":"Typical cafeteria style restaurant in a smokey casino.  Food was mediocre, slow service and staff wasn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the norm here, but Molly was super slow and didn't bring out what she was supposed to. Drink glasses sat empty. Other people sitting in different sections who came in 10 minutes after us, we're waited on before us. So think we just got a bad waitress. Not a good first experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here.  I have been here about 10 times over the past 18 months.  Every time I go I order something different off of the menu.  The one thing that NEVER changes is the SLOOOOWW SERVICE.  I often feel ignored by some of the waitresses.  I like the food so I will be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I didn't used to go to Rampart because it was so smoky, but they must've fixed something, because it's not as bad as it was. That's a good thing, because the Promenade cafe is open to the casino, although they do use a non-smoking area as a buffer zone.  Even if you're the only ones waiting, it usually takes a few minutes to get seated. The service can be hit and miss. But the menu has a wide variety, and the portions are substantial. The salads are good, not just a few handfuls of lettuce from a bag. The omelets are good. The burgers are good. The chicken pot pie is good. The sandwiches are good. You get the point...This isn't a place where you're stuck with just one thing that you like on the menu.   This has replaced the Suncoast cafe for us since they've gone downhill, and we're not missing it at all."}
{"text":"The Promenade Cafe very nice classy place in side Rampart Casino. I had San Francisco sour dough burger priced at only $7.99 a good deal. The service was great even though it was Saturday the cafe was extremely busy.  The food was good thumbs up, far better than Posh Burger!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going here. We use a restaruant.com certificate and we always have left overs. The food is decent and we enjoy the prime rib dinner the most. I personally dont like the parking because it soooo far from the entrance. The service is sub par and they ignore us majority of the time. But i cant complain because we are getting a good deal with the food."}
{"text":"It's open 24 hours a day and serves breakfast at all times, but eat here as a last resort.   There are definitely better restaurants at this resort, but this is the cheapest... for a reason. I had the eggs, bacon and hash browns that also came with something they were calling a biscuit... but I have not yet received the sample back from the lab to verify this claim.   The \"restaurant\" is overlooking the smoke filled casino which is better than staring at four walls I suppose... They had a large menu selection, but I would be afraid to try much of it.   Eat here after you lose all of your money at the craps table and feel like punishing yourself."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the $9.99 Steak and Lobster special as advertised on TV commercials (as well as the chicken fettuccine Alfredo for $9.99). Steak and Lobster were minature size and poor quality steak which was a tough strip (I think), but shown on TV as a filet mignon, very deceiving!! The pasta dinner was \"ok\" and the dessert was included. I chose the cheesecake.  When the server brought it to our table I jokingly said, \"did it shrink\"?  It was the smallest piece I have ever seen served at any restaurant. Service was slow, server wasn't very pleasant and food was poor. As another person wrote, \"you get what you pay for\". We're locals and this will be our first and last visit and no, we didn't lose any money as a previous reviewer wrote."}
{"text":"Staying here at the JW Marriott, 11 years old son wants to have a snack after 2hoits swimming. I thought maybe it's quicker to get service here, NOT!!   I have no against older waitresses however, they get caught up with the same age patrons that be they forget why they are working. We literally waited 15 minutes and watch them go back and forth. So, after my patience, I stood up and our waitress comes and rushing to get our order. So, I told her that the service is too slow and my son does not have 1 hour to wait to place our order.   She then told me that she was not aware that we are waiting to put order in. DUH!!! The menu is in front of me. Hellloooo."}
{"text":"Went here for s quick breakfast before lounging at the pool. Whomever it is making the omelette is doing a fine job. My tomato, spinach and cheese omelette was cooked perfectly. I ordered link sausage & my husband the patty sausages, go with the patty. Service was quick & attentive enough. I'll likely be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"If you wish to have a quick bite to eat after losing $2000, then go the Promenade Cafe and ask for Daniel.  He's always quick to accommodate,  I wanted chicken and waffles and he didn't hesitate to make that happen, even after the main menu expired and the late night menu took over.  He's always taken great care of me and my requests.  Thanks Daniel"}
{"text":"Promenade Cafe is definitely a go-to for my co-workers and I after work late nights.   The $2.99 special can't be beat, and the portions are all super big.   Though the price is ultimately what's intriguing, we regularly dine with Barb, who is the sweetest server!   She remembers our drink order Everytime and always chats with us.   I haven't tried anything off the regular menu, but their graveyard specials are unbeatable!  Go see Barb, too!"}
{"text":"Went here with my sister in law for their September 2015 players card special on the steak and lobster half off. The price was 19.99 for one person so basically it was around $10 bucks. Read the reviews on Yelp about the slow service, but still decided to give it s shot. When we got there, it turns out that they do this special often and sometimes price it at $9.99 per person so it roughly is the same price, pretty much to lure in gamblers and locals. Ambience was rather slow and very old like feeling, not because of customers but because of the lighting and layout...it just felt out dated and uncared for. It was clean, don't get me wrong...maybe it was just my mood. Food was decent and though the lobster and steak were fairly small, together plus the price was still filling and a great deal. I mean it wasn't the best lobster or steak I ever had but it was alright. Still hit the spot. But my main reason for the one star is the fact of the service. It was terribly slow especially when the cafe wasn't even 1/4 capacity filled. Staff were respectful and nice but rather slow. I don't know why but you would think with all these reviews they would have solve this issue. Won't be coming back here for a while if ever."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is great!  All these terrible reviews must be from people who already lost their money...  You can't go wrong here.  I recommend their waffles!"}
{"text":"2 PM Wed, the place is not too crowded for lunch. The cigarette smoke blows in from the casino so finding a seat that has fresh air is zilch. I ordered the steak/lobster, Rare, you cannot substitute mashed potatoes. The beef was a prime rib and was decent! The lobster tail was good. Total $10.80 + tip. So I go there again today, Thurs. The steak is thick cut sirloin, unbelievably rubbery, and ask for a thin piece like the one I got yesterday. She brought back another 1/2\" thick piece, still rubbery. The lobster tail was smaller than yesterday's. I got lucky on Wednesday, it was much better. This place is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner here four nights ago and we both ordered the prime.  Our drink server was very friendly and helpful, our waitress seemed bored and distant.  she had a very difficult time smiling and making small talk.  Maybe because she seemed to be Vietnamese although she spoke nearly perfect English. When our meal arrived and we cut into the prime, it was like cutting a board with a butter knife.  I asked for a chainsaw and told our waitress the meat was too hard as did my wife.  Our drink master asked if things were good and when we told her the meat was to hard she got the manager who pleasantly got us another cut of prime.  Well this to lead to us not eating our primer rib all together because the meat was so hard it nearly broke my teeth.  We ended up giving our share to our dog who didn't care if the darn thing was as hard as a rock.  Its been nearly a year since we came here to dine and found the service a big improvement but the quality of the food was a total let down.  Now we'll probably never go back to dine on prime rib again, but we really enjoy the Grand Cafe's prime rib at the Red Rock a thousand times better then this place.  Seems the cooks need more training on how to prepare their prime rib.  Service again is a very big improvement and they now have very nice and helpful people working here."}
{"text":"We had brunch here about a month ago and split an omelette (Canadian bacon, provolone, and tomato) and a breakfast burrito.   The service was slow. (1/5 stars)  The food was good (3/5) but the portions were small...definitely not worth the forty minute wait."}
{"text":"It's your basic diner type place located smack dab in the middle of a casino in Vegas. Not unique or special but decent enough. The staff was friendly and prompt in service. The food was plentiful. The decor was dated and the noise from the casino was a bit more intrusive than I would like, but all in all, not too bad though they burnt my husband's bacon to high heaven. Why they thought that would be ok to serve is beyond me, but to each his own."}
{"text":"This is truly a get what you pay for kind of place. Service is like that of Denny's or Waffle House. They call you honey, get what you want but disappear and move like molasses. I ordered a taco salad and it was salsa from a jar and the guacamole was some kind of weird consistency.  The salad was simple and the chicken was chewy. But this is probably the cheapest meal you will get around town, so if you are looking for pure nourishment on a budget and don't care about flavor - this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The 2.21 special  you can not ask for a to go box.  So you need to finish everything there."}
{"text":"Was seated and just opened menu and literally 5 seconds before asked what was ordering. Not even an \"are you ready?\" or \"anything to drink?\" Once ordered, was brought out a carraff of coffee, but no mug. After 5 minutes of contemplating just drinking straight out of the carraff was finally given a mug. Ordered a meat lovers skillet w/ over medium eggs. Was served scrambled eggs. Eggs were obviously liquid and not whole fresh as you get that weird texture and water film/residue. Also, this place doesn't offer potatoes w item. No hash browns, homefries, or seasoned. Nothing. Just toast. I find that odd .  Also never saw waitress after food delivery. No refills, no check. Paid cashier and got out.  Don't bother going. Not even if you're staying there. Go eat pre-frozen whatever from Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast because it's a great price and pretty good food. The crusted French toast is amazing but hard to finish because it's so rick. I was happy with everything I've had here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Oh Rampart, oh Rampart how you give me mixed feelings.  The Promenade Café is a nice little spot within the Rampart where patrons can go an enjoy a meal at a decent price.  Their three-course special with apptz, main course, and dessert is quite the deal; however, with that said- it has been hit or miss the two times I have been here.    The first time I went I got Poppers, a burger, and shortcake.  The poppers were good, nothing to brag about though; the burger was very tasty and cooked perfectly medium as I asked; and the shortcake was good as well, again nothing to brag about it.  For the price that was a decent meal and I was satisfied enough to come back.    The second time I went I got potato skins, braised lamb, and apple crumb.  The potato skins were not off the chain or anything, but they were pretty good, I'll give them that.  The braised lamb- OH THE BRAISED LAMB, what good things can I possibly say about this dish...hmmm... NOTHING! It was disgusting, atrocious, should have been tossed in the trash the moment it was made.  It tasted like a stale 5-day old beef stew.  I took two bites and didn't touch another piece of the entire dish.  I was not the only one in my party who ordered this, someone else did and though the same thing I did.  The apple crumb, was very tasty, it was my favorite part of the meal, so cheers to that!   Needless to say, I will be back, to try something else, because the price is right.  Just no LAMB!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place, but the staff has changed. The hostess was so rude. Kept people waiting for days, even with empty tables. When I finally got seated, she put me right next to a table full of kids. When I asked for a different table, she rolled her eyes, and was a total smart ass. NO people skills whatsoever. The service has become progressively worse. Looks like I'll need to find a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Taste like overly salty hospital food......but the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"This isn't good food. It's like a Waffle House situated in a casino. The food is under seasoned, yet edible."}
{"text":"This is a mix mix mix of feelings!   Great breakfast for the money,  generous portion of egg whites and the pancakes are great.   The waitresses need an attitude adjustment, the carpet a good cleaning and  more smiles from the service staff!  You will get your moneys worth!  Cheap food and cheap service."}
{"text":"Always excellent food! 24 hour breakfast and soups, burgers, sandwiches! What more can you want? When in the area I highly recommend.  Tonight we ordered the omelet and chicken and waffles. Very tasty. Good service!"}
{"text":"This quiet cafe (at least when we went there) is open 24 hours a day serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and a late-night menu.   It does have a $7.99 value 3 course menu where you can pick from a choice of appetizers like shrimp cocktail, soups, tato skins + entrees:  eggplant lasagne, ham, stuffed lobster ($2 extra) + dessert:  apple cobbler, choka lotta cake, whole lot a jello  & includes coffee/ tea/iced tea or soft drink or you can order off the extensive menu which is available at all hours.  Everything was fine, service was quick & there's really nothing not to like other than it's not a gourmet place."}
{"text":"Typical food. Nothing fancy. No frills. But nothing bland or horrible either. If you're just looking for a place to eat, this will do."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to just eat because the craving for a really, really late dinner is too real, then hit up Promenade Cafe.  It has a more quiet ambience than the cafe at Red Rock Hotel, with a much smaller dining area. They're known for their $2.99 graveyard specials. So go crazy with ordering. LOL However, their regular dining menu is pretty good too. The location of the cafe, which is inside Rampart Casino, is great for those that live in the surrounding area. You don't have to travel so far for a quick bite or cheap late night eats.  I usually come here after a long day of being out. It's one of those places you go to when you're so tired from all the day's festivities, but you still want an easy meal that soothes you for the rest of the night. I don't know about you, but having breakfast items late at night is the best. :]  No real explanation there. It just is.  Service has never been a problem, but I'm not sure how it is during the day since I only frequent this place at night. It's a laid-back restaurant and it's never busy when I come here. If you're in the area and nothing else is open for some quick eats, stop by this cafe.   It's also a great place to chill with friends after being out with them the whole day because.. you know... you really don't want the night to end just yet. :]"}
{"text":"I ordered fried shrimp and the fish and chips. First off the shrimps  were very tiny and the fish was burnt the server  was awful. The  only good thing  were the drinks that's because we brought  our own drinks.  Don't come here. You even have to flag down your freaking server and they need better cooks."}
{"text":"Had dinner later than usual; so this was dinner for the following day.  Chicken noodle soup was warm, but I was hungry so I practically licked the bowl.  I got the 3 courses for as low as $9.99.  FYI the salmon is $15.99 includes the soup, the meal, and a dessert.  Choices of rice, mashed or baked potato is available.  It was good.  Not the best seafood everrrr.  Menu is almost like a Denny's.  But I can say I'd find more satisfying selections on a Denny's menu.  Our server Lucy was awesome though - funny sweetheart.  It was a convenient restaurant after our penny slot gambling spree.  So there; an average 3***."}
{"text":"Came in after a wedding with 4 other exhausted friends. After over 30 minutes, we're all served profoundly undercooked chicken (blood pools in the middle of all pieces). The server apologized and took our new order. We left a half hour later after not being served. The server never returned. There were only two other patrons."}
{"text":"After coming to the Promenade Cafe I now know what purgatory looks like. A lot of waiting, and the food sucks.  The only shining light of our meal was our friendly waitress who sadly had to go on her break and left us with a mix of awful waitresses who could care less about us since they had nothing to gain.  The food was cold and basically flavorless but at $9.99 I'm sure they could've served cardboard and the Jew in me still would've ordered the special. I can't help myself. But I do know one thing, and that is to never come back to purgatory again. I'd rather go straight to hell!"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy eating here-decent food for the price and a friendly, mature staff, even though we are somewhat younger than their typical clientele.  For the most part, food quality is down (dry prime rib and not cooked as requested) and service is really down:  unfriendly waitress and cashier, no beverage refills until the meal was finished, no checking in with us, no \"how was everything today\" at the end (and the food and beverage manager was at the cashier station). Therefore, no need for us to return."}
{"text":"I am not sure where to begin.... Envision if you will a late Thursday night, a minimally occupied upscale version of Dennys....waitress \"Patti\" had the personality of a fish, the tables were dirty, the menu sticky.  We ordered burgers and onions rings....wait for it ....35 minutes later we were given a luke-warm - greasy/bland burger.  The rings were saturated with stagnant  frying oil & the lettuce brown.     No-one checked on us - we had to get condiments from the neighboring table.  Our lemonades, never refilled.    We have been here before, the slow & bland service is baseline....  Not recommended - Don't do it!  Go to Dennys!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place 2 times during my stay.  Here's the food that I ate at this restaurant.  I ate the cheeseburger with regular toppings and jalapenos with french fries. The burger was excellent! Well made burger patty!   I also ate the breakfast burrito! It tasted very good. Typical for a mexican breakfast dish.   The service was great! Friendly servers. I would come back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Really suprised to see some of the bad reviews here. I have been a couple of times, and the food is consistently tasty, and a great value for the money. this last time, we had prime rib and salmon, and both were perfectly cooked and great portions. Service was a little slow, but not so bad it affected our experience. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"We ate there last night and ordered the three course dinner of prime rib and shrimp pasta pomodoro. We were served with a dinner salad and soup for first course. The green mixed salad has a lot of rotten lettuce. The waitress replaced the salad with another salad with lots of nasty slimey lettuce. The prime rib was so tough and the mashed potato was so watery-powdered potato most probably. The restaurant was not busy yet we hardly see our waitress. Very bad food and service !"}
{"text":"Short and sweet review... food is pretty good but service sucks here!  If anyone from Rampart reads this please improve service in your cafe!"}
{"text":"i used to come here late night when I was drunk to get some graveyard steak and eggs because why not?  but recently my girlfriend got me to come here, in which I would've preferred to go somewhere else (it was not a late drunk night) and it was still pretty good, minus the fact we had frog row seats to an almost cat fight that occurred in front of the restrooms. but that's besides the point... I just wanted to let you guys know how great their peanut butter cheesecake is. I would come here at any time of the day to eat this work of art. do not underestimate it, just get it. the drizzle of the vanilla sauce on the side pairs so gracefully with every bite and every shave of gold on top. does cheesecake factory even have this?"}
{"text":"Living in the suburbs, can be a disadvantage when needing comfort food at super cheap prices during late night hours. It was a long day for my family and we had one of those moments when your too tired to cook and then worry about cleaning up afterwards. So we ended up trying this place out with the help of my Yelp app. What drew us to this place was the prices but was quite pleased that they had a good variety of graveyard specials to choose from.   Our server was friendly and attentive, he made sure everything was okay with us. The portions are quite large and it was a bit overwhelming especially the order of pancakes. However, everything we had was satisfying and nothing was mind blowing just more of an afterthought. The great thing about this place is that the crowd is more smaller than other places and the service moves pretty quickly. A good option if your looking for cheap comfort food!  2017 Yelp Review #37"}
{"text":"While staying at the JW Marriott Resort we visited this cafe to grab some desserts for the kids. The women working there were not friendly or helpful, but one did think to hand us a menu.  The menu describes brownie pie with chocolate syrup and ice cream. The vanilla cheesecake promised strawberry sauce. We paid for the deserts and brought them up to the room to find dry brownie wedges without any toppings and plain cheesecake without strawberries.  The cafe is located in the casino, so if you're not a smoker this is an uncomfortable place to breathe."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is hit & miss. We ordered the small prime rib a month or so ago, and when it arrived the plate was packed full. When I said, \"This is the small?\", the waitress responded that they just cut the slices without weighing them. The medium rare was perfectly cook & delicious! I had asked the waitress if the mashed were real potatoes or powdered & she said \"real\", They were NOT real, but mainly powdered with little bits of real potato mixed in. When she brought the check, I told her that mixing bits of real potato in with the powdered wasn't fooling anyone, but that the prime rib made up for it. Her response was, \"We say what they tell us to say\".  A couple of weeks later we went back with half a dozen visiting relatives & recommended the prime rib. BIG MISTAKE. Everyone's was very dry & tough. The veg was different this time & were frozen green beans that shot a stream of water when pierced by the fork. I opted for the french fries this time, but they also were dry & tasteless.  We had seen signs in past visits for $9.99 Steak & Lobster (photo in earlier post), so we thought that we'd give it another shot (best of three). The steak was about 2 inches in diameter & about 1 inch thick, small, yes, but cooked just right & very tasty. As expected the lobster tail shell was also small, but I really was surprised at how little meat there was. It amounted at most to about 2 medium shrimps. I cut it into 4 small pieces & it was gone. it had been covered in paprika, broiled until dry & served without benefit of melted butter. The veg & potato were as described above. When the check came we were shocked to see that the $9.99 deal had expired. The 2 minuscule meals with one Corona (served without lime) and one white wine (Sutter Home served from a small plastic bottle) came to over $50! ! !  It now think it's fair to say that we are done with this place. It appears that ordering food here is as big a gamble as playing their slots!"}
{"text":"Sloooow service. Basically they seat you and forget about you. I watched it happen to everyone who came in. Food wasn't very good, either."}
{"text":"My family has been here 3 different time.  Same Customer service every time.   They suck!!!!!    This last time I was giving it one last chance.  It was for my mom's birthday.  To remind y'all this casino isn't on the strip so the customer service should be better.   It was funny We asked for the manager and the manager tried to send the waitress to speak with us...... ah no I'm sorry We asked for the manager not for the waitress that ignored us the whole time.    We spoken to the manager on duty.  Didn't get her name but she was the older, skinny , Burnett.  She was no help at all.    She said that she trained her staff to have fantastic customer service........   yeah right.     I'm not sorry to say this but that Manager can't cut it as a cashier at McDonald's"}
{"text":"Meeting friends here for dinner tonight, two had blintzes, one had the veal shank special, and I had the Cuban sandwich.  I haven't been here in over a year and nothing has changed--including the menu.    My Cuban sandwich was good, and it came with fries (my choice).  Service was good and I really have no complaints.  There's simply nothing compelling about eating here that makes me think, \"Hey, I think I'll go to the Rampart and eat at the Promenade Café."}
{"text":"Graveyard Special was $2.99 and it hit the spot  the server was super sweet and I'm definitely going back. The hostess was a bit standoffish, but overall good service and good bacon."}
{"text":"Poor selection and poor service. The hostess was too busy to seat me at 3 AM because she was busy talking to the security gaurd. The food was okay, no specials were available. The waitress was efficient, bringing me several ice teas at once.   At the end of my meal, the hostess was busy chatting up the only other customer in the cafe, an older gentleman, to bother to pick up my check. She was quick to take the other gentleman's check. So I guess, if you are a single, older gentleman or have one in your party, then this is the restaurant for you. nOtherwise, this place is just meh."}
{"text":"The Heart of Vegas, truly a locals Cafe and Casino, servers are friendly and caring. They make you feel at home $2.99 graveyard specials are amazing and cannot be beat. They also serve some awesome dinning specials, why pay over priced Strip prices for food when you can fill up for less with homestyle meals. You owe yourself a visit to Rampart Casino and the Promenade cafe"}
{"text":"Depending when or if you eat here, service is really night and day. That being said, I'm breaking this review down to food/service in AM and PM  Night:  4 Stars At night, I noticed that there was only a handful of servers working.  But this wasn't an issue since our food was prepared and delivered pretty quick. The servers are also very attentive and at the same time in no rush to get your out of the restaurant.  For dinner, I had their special, which is their half chicken for $7.99.  Starving like a madman, I ended up getting 2 orders making that one full chicken for me.  Yes, I finished it. Yes, I was stuffed. This was pretty and cheap considering how much I got.  The rest of the menu actually looked pretty good and there's enough of a selection for everybody.  Morning: 2 Stars It's actually busier in the morning and they know this. My issue, service really lags here.  With 8 servers working, you would think that water and our orders would be quicker than 15 minutes. Food comes out quick once you finally get someone to take your order.  It's the pre-order part where you need some patience.  What's worse, once you get your food, your check is also handed to you. It's almost like they can't wait for you to leave unlike at night where our server told is to take our time.  For breakfast, I got their 3 egg white omelet w/spinach and mushrooms. This was so delicious that I almost moved the stars up to 3.  I had a good experience at night and a poor one in the morning.  I think that my overall rating of 3 stars is fair."}
{"text":"Hearty breakfasts, excellent service...  I ordered the NY steak and eggs plus a side of  pancakes (because the sweet tooth needs to be satisfied)...Pancakes were delicious and fluffy, Ginomous!  Shoulda stuck with one single stack.  Typical steak and eggs dish - but when you're in Vegas, most places seem to hit the spot exactly the way it should.    Love coming here while staying at the JW...Comfortable atmosphere, good coffee...Mollie, our waitress, awesome."}
{"text":"the $9.99 steak and lobster special got us in the door.  It was actually better than I thought it would be for the price!  The only real issue is the wait.  Not only are you waiting for a table, but the waiter stops by once in a blue moon, so order your entre as soon as you sit down!  We finished our meal and still had to wait about 20 minutes for a waitress to give us our check so we can leave.  We still gave her a good tip though."}
{"text":"The service here is usually slow (especially with the elderly waitresses) but tonight was the worst. We sat down and was sitting there for literally 10 minutes before the waitress came and told us \"I'll be right with you\". 20 minutes past and we still don't have drinks? We left to go eat at the buffet. That waitress is a nice lady as we've been served by her before.... But 20 minutes is ridiculous. Hire more staff or lose your customers."}
{"text":"Took a long time to get seated when there were lots of open table. All staff look unhappy and rude. Our server was nice to us but yell at the next table for asking for a straw. Our corn-beef hash was bad as in it's sour. I am hoping I don't get food poison as I am leaving the restaurant. Want to tell them about it but non of the staff care to ask how was things."}
{"text":"This is a standard full-service coffee shop restaurant within a casino, and a perfectly good one at that with some of the lowest prices I have seen in a few years anywhere in the United States. If you love coffee shops as I do, this place should scratch the itch.  Use a coupon and it becomes the deal of the month.  Chef salad (about $8) was good, and bleu cheese dressing tasted like it was made fresh.  The turkey seemed to have been cut from an actual turkey roasted on property, rather than lunchmeat.    The Mrs. ordered an Asian chicken salad and seemed perfectly happy with it.  Plenty of food (including proteins) in both salads.  The finagle here is all of the specials, if they are what you want.  Our young kids shared the 3-course weekday dinner with appetizer (they chose soup), main course (spaghetti and meatballs), and dessert (apple cobbler, which was excellent), for about $9.  On our visit they happily allowed us to use the restaurant.com coupon that led us there with the special, even though both the special and the coupon listed the usual disclaimer prohibiting combinations of discounts.    The only thing I didn't like was the iced tea, which clearly came from a syrup.  I should have ordered hot tea with a glass of ice but I only thought about this later.  This is very much a locals' casino restaurant.  We were the only people there with children, but they were very accommodating and seemed happy to see them.  Generally an older crowd, perhaps due to the fact that we visited on a Wednesday.   For two main-course salads, the aforementioned weekday dinner trifecta,  soft drinks all around, and an extra slice of cake, total bill  including tax and full tip, less restaurant.com discount, was just under $20.  WOW.    Same meal would push $100 on the strip."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Depressing Cafe is Depressing (and sub par)  *the tl;dr on top of a review is quite ingenious imo, anyways*  I ate that this place one time before this review and I completely loved the cheese sticks but forgot everything else on the menu.  So, I convinced my roommate that Promenade Cafe was THE place to eat since I recalled all the food was so cheap and I didn't want to go to Buzz BBQ.  So let me walk through how I got to 2 stars.  We are walking in the cafe, I have good expectations at this point (5 stars).  Once taking a gander at the people at the place, I realized that the average age of cafe went from 70 to about 39, it kind of smelled like Florida.    (Still 5 stars, eff losing stars for agism)  3-4 different waiters/waitresses kept coming up and asking us what we wanted to drink, it was pretty confusing after awhile. Which was odd since only 4 other people were in the facility.  I ended up getting the 3 course meal for $9.99 which included cheese sticks, spaghetti and meatballs, and some berry cake.  Still, 5 stars up to this point.  Then our normal waitress left to go on break.  Then after I got my cheese sticks (which were delicious) it took a good 20+ minutes for the main course to be served.  (Hmm...losin a star here)  Once I received my food, I couldn't wait to eat it.  Clearly after the long delay of making this food, I would pretty much be eating gods nectar, right?!  Boy howdy, I have never seen anyone make extremely sub par pasta before.  (Down to 3 stars)  After leaving a bad taste, I couldn't wait for desert to come around.  Except that it was a good 30 minutes before we received our desert.  There was about 5 customers and 10 staff, how the hell? On top of that, the berry cake was pretty dry and it was just bleh.  (1.5 stars).  And to top it all off, while my roommate and I were waiting for desert.  An elderly woman walked to a table and when the waiter asked her how many people will be joining, she said in a loud and dead tone, \"I'm eating alone tonight\".  (gains a 1/2 pity star, for a total of 2 stars)  Hearing that was so depressing, that I couldn't even continue whatever conversation what I talking about.  It completely killed whatever positive atmosphere that was going on at the moment.  I feel like cutting my wrist just thinking about this place, it's almost as depressing as Silverton Casino."}
{"text":"Its not bad.   That is all I can say."}
{"text":"I think this 24 hour cafe is better than the one at Red Rock. The service is a little slow  but at least they check in on you. I was beginning to think the food was just okay here until I tried their burger. I think it was called their San Francisco Burger. It's served on cheesy sour dough bread . This time it was served with fries but I usually prefer their home made chips. It's so good!  The other thing I like here is their tomato soup especially on a cold day."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try...my steak was over cooked and charred, while my lobster was also neglected. Definitely the mashed potatoes came out of a box. My butter was not ready to be served as you can see in the pic! The service was horrible at a whopping 9.99 special posted in front of the rampart casino this visit was extremely disappointing! The service was horrible!!!!!! Keep your money and run."}
{"text":"Clean, nice decor, comfortable seating, reasonable priced, good home style cooking, no complaints from this Yelper, I do like home style cooking with quality and you'll get that here.  Do think their average Overall Rating should be at least 3, I really see no reason to ding them on anything.  Went for breakfast only."}
{"text":"The Promenade Cafe is the cafe of the J.W. Marriott Resort at Summerlin / The Rampart Casino. It is the go to restaurant for casual dining in this Summerlin property.    In the last couple of months when I was in the area I had dinner here. What strikes me about Promenade  Cafe is that it is inside an attractive casino resort that is surrounded by golf courses and upmarket homes, yet charges prices similar to a Boulder Highway casino. On both visits, I'd enjoy a taste of Boulder Highway in the heart of Summerlin.     The two meals that I enjoyed here have been the chicken fettuccine and spaghetti with meatballs. The chicken fettuccine is one of three $9.99 deals where you pick a soup or salad, a listed entrée, and choice of a listed dessert. Of course the beverage and tip accelerate the bill to around $15 which is worth it. The food was good. The strawberry cheesecake was puny. On this visit the tone of the service was Allright with the exception of a major restaurant etiquette no! no! When a guest is still working on the entrée, you never ever place the dessert on the table. Talk about being hurried. And why? I was one of the few guests in the restaurant. On Saturday, I stopped here after Dessert Shores where I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs that included soup or salad. It costed $7.99 comparable to an old school casino. Spaghetti with meatballs is also one of the few $9.99 dinners. The $2 difference is the puny dessert. The chicken noodle soup was in a bowl in lieu of a cup that is the standard in many resorts. I appreciated the larger portion. The spaghetti with meatballs was okay. To be honest this is fool proof course that is impossible to mess up. But it fell short of the spaghetti & meatballs that I am a fan of in the Railroad Pass Casino. Three meatballs accompanyed the spaghettis. It would of been nice if Promenade Cafe offered Grated to put on the spaghetti as most places do. Maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor.     Spending some time here, I observed that the Starbuck's down the hall closes around 9 P.M. In the later hours of the evening this is the spot for coffee.    In conclusion, Promenade Cafe is a decent restaurant  to enjoy an old school casino style dinner in the heart of Summerlin. Compared to the cafe in the Sun Coast  a traffic signal south on Rampart Boulevard, I prefer it over the Promenade Cafe. My final verdict: Promenade Cafe 3 Stars."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrific. They are so terribly unprepared and SLOW. The restaurant was only half full, and the service was still shockingly bad. We sat at our table and were ignored for about 10 minutes. Then a woman came over and asked what we wanted to drink. We told her and said we were ready to order but she replied, \"not your server--drinks only.\" So we continued to wait. Finally our server moseyed over and took our order. We then waited another 20 minutes for our food (we'll actually my mom got her food in about 18 and I got mine in 25, so we ate separately). The food here actually isn't bad and it's reasonably priced, but you can only come here when you're not very hungry and ready to wait a while before you eat. This is obviously a place where servers go to retire and they can take their sweet time. It also doesn't help that this restaurant is connected to the casino and smells terribly of cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"It's sad the Cafe NEVER has enough staff. They are always short handed so SERVICE is Slow. No one to bus tables or pour water. Makes meals stressful. It's always busy but without proper staffing it's never my first choice. We visit my father 5 times a year always stay at JW and our father always wants to eat here. Rampart needs to address service is. Hoping the new deli will be a better option, because for your casino & hotel the Promenade is not a good choice. Should be a thriving Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite spot because their food is always fresh, tasty and staffs were really nice all the time but our server today \"NIDA\". Used to love this place for late nite specials, 3 course meal or lobster &steak special. After we order our food, we asked whats the todays soup and our waitress \"NIDA\" said \"i am busy\" then she just walked away from our table. her face was like \"dont bother me\" Do you think telling us what kinda soup you guys have was a  hard question or take looooong time to answer? That was really rude. And guess she put our order wrong or something cuz took exactly 43 minutes. Asked for horseradish, never brought it, of course no refills on drinks. She just brought the check at the end. Omgash never coming back when shes working. Shes terrible, and horrible."}
{"text":"suncoast is sooo empty lately.  No one really seems to be coming here any more.  Their food/restaurant options are blah and boring, most of their restaurants don't even open during the daytime anymore (only for dinner)  Service throughout the place is fair at best.  As far as the cafe, their menu is very simple and boring and a little over priced.  However their lunch special for their asian food is surprisingly good, and good portions too (only $6.99)  You get a choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour (i've had both before and both are quite good)  an egg roll and I ordered the general chicken with fried rice)  We had also ordered a basket of onion rings and those are large and VERY yummy.  Their cafe wouldn't be my first choice of places to goto but it's ok for lunch.  It's DEFINITELY better then their buffet.  Their buffet is horrible. I'd MUCH rather goto the orleans"}
{"text":"Only came here for breakfast because it was convenient since we were staying at the JW Marriott.  I ordered Corn Beef and Hash.  It was so dry and inedible as if the cook left it on the grill then went on a break.  I would not recommend this place unless there were no other options.  Thank goodness I had room credit otherwise, I would have sent the food back."}
{"text":"I urge you to check your \"check\" before you pay! We were charged for coffee twice and we never even ordered coffee, an automatic add?!?!? After that adjustment was made there was never an apology or anything said.... Also the \"special\" $3.99 breakfast is only for adults over 21 years and you must have a players card...Never coming back."}
{"text":"Nestled in between the rough and tumble Rampart casino and the high end JW Marriott resort...the Promenade Cafe isn't nearly as bad as some reviews might suggest. We had breakfast there two mornings and our experience was three star/A-OK all the way. Totally average....no \"Wow\" factors but nothing even approaching bad. Our server both mornings was Robin....friendly enough..you get your food and off you go.I enjoyed my sausage and cheese omelet one morning and basic bacon and eggs the next. other family members had pancakes...french toast and the fruit platters...all with no complaints. Its a typical 24/7 spot....a little smokey...a little sluggish but overall..it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Located in a very nice fancy spa/resort style hotel you would think the food should be better. I had a few meals here and all of them tasted like they were prepared from frozen. Chicken fried steak(frozen premade patty reheated in oven), mashed potatoes from a box, veggies (frozen from a bag, watery, overcooked), turkey club (turkey meat frozen, reheated), sandwich tasted watery. I've never had bad food at a Las Vegas hotel before. I'm really shocked with how bad this was...."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! First of all the waitress was acting weird when she approached our table. She had a combination of gray and frost hair. She took our order brought our food and we never saw her again. So my husband and I proceeded to walk to the front; I had my plate in my hand because I needed a to go bag right? The people up front were just looking and standing. I really didn't know why they were there because they weren't keeping track of their waitresses because she was lost. My personal opinion. The waitress was on drugs. So I then bagged my food up front at the cash register after the cashier brought me a bag. They went and dragged the waitress from I don't know where and she gave the cashier the ticket. My husband paid of course no tip. I HAVE A TIP. HIRE SOME NEW STAFF AND MONITOR YOUR WAITSTAFFF. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO SERVING BLACK PEOPLE. NO BLACK STAFF AT RAMPART CASINO. I take that back I saw a biracial cocktail waitress. Sincerely, Tracey Jones"}
{"text":"Worst service and food I have ever experienced.  I'm not sure what happened to this place but it has gone so far downhill it can never climb back up.  We were seated at 9:15 and finally begged for the check at 10:55.  We ordered coffee and water with no lemon to start.  The server brought pepsi and water with lemon.  We told her that wasn't ours and she looked like we were speaking a language she didn't understand.  We were only given refills once even after signaling her several times.  She was not the same server as our waitress.   Our waitress took forever to do anything moving at a snails pace.   She disappeared in the back for 15 minutes at time.  Several people around us also complained and one asked for the manager.  Not sure what she was doing in the kitchen but it sure wasn't helping anything to move faster.  The egg roll appetizer took over 24 minutes to be served then the dinner arrived 25 minutes after that.  The egg rolls were disgusting, greasy and gross.  They tasted like I'd imagine egg rolls to taste that had been sitting in the back of the freezer for a year.  I ordered the fish tacos.  Again, horrid.  The batter on the fish was greasy, thick and super tough.  The fish had zero taste.  The amount of slaw was minuscule on each of the three tacos so I couldn't even cover up the bad fish.  My husband had the philly cheese steak.  The bun was soggy and stale.  The meat was full of fat and scraps.  They did remember to hold the mushrooms so one point for that.  The place was not that busy.  I have no idea what the hold up was or why the food was so bad.  We have eaten here several times in the past, as recently as January 2, and never had an issue."}
{"text":"It may sound silly but I am a big fan of this Cafe. Locate in the Rampart Casino, we frequent the adjoining JW Marriott Resort quite often. The food here is great! I am partial to their Greek Sald with Chicken and the Chef's special, obviously handmade, vinaigrette. YUM! My husband says they have a great burger, homemade soups and the Beef Deep is delish!!! Sometimes we grab the late night Prime Rib after a fun evening in the Casino. And Breakfast is a steal here! They servers are all great!  We love that they remember us and sometimes our names/ orders too! When my local friends meet me here they too are amazed and the fresh quality and friendly service the Cafe has to offer. Give it a try!! :)  It deserves 5 stars for what it is, not because it is a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"This Cafe is in the J.W. Marriott Resort at Summerlin / The Rampart Casino   Absolutely the WORST service!!  We were going here quite a bit they have a dinner specials and we liked that they have these specials and they are pretty good with appetizer and dessert! The only thing is don't expect a big dessert it is very small! You do get what you pay for I guess!  Time after time it seemed like the servers just take their time and not care if you have your drinks filled or if you need anything. We have had to go to the kitchen door where they walk in to ask where our waitress was!!  I think they need new staff who wants to work and needs to work to get them to service the tables better. Some act like it is just too much for them. Unless we see service has changed we would rather eat at the buffet or the Irish pub across the way!"}
{"text":"Ok, so let's be real. When you look at this place, what you'd expect is what you get. It's very reasonably priced, and the specials are really cheap. But this is a classic example of you get what you pay for. The food is mostly barely a step above Denny's (and sometimes below it), with frozen vegetables and canned/packaged everything else."}
{"text":"Slowest service in the west, useless management, and only adequate food pervade this little Promenade. I've given this place a try 3 times. Each time I went in with mild expectations and came out disappointed. Just because they have cheap food, it doesn't justify mediocre service. I think the service quality is inverted. The manager should lead a team in customer service. So far, it's been the bus boys who have been the most helpful then, the capable servers were reasonably kind, and the managers were simply ignorant and oblivious to non-regulars. The surf and turf special is $9.99 and not on the menu. The early riser specials are $3.99. But don't expect much from them, tough steak, small rubbery lobster tail, and over-cooked bacon. Good luck with this one."}
{"text":"Awful service. Awful food. WOW. Avoid at all costs. The Reuben made me question my love for Reubens and my company said the cheese tasted like plastic."}
