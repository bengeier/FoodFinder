{"text":"The turkey Reuben is fantastic.  They use real honest-to-goodness turkey meat.  Not the sliced, processed version.  The sweet potato fries are to die for.  I've been there only for lunch but plan to return after work to take advantage of their HUGE craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. My wife had an iced Starbucks drink and the waitress greeted us with that was not \"acceptable in here.\"  We gladly left because it didn't look that nice anyways. I think there are better choices around town"}
{"text":"Fun cheap and great location.  Perogies are the best in town"}
{"text":"We used to go there, not anymore, reason we went there last night to give it another try. Big mistake, very nasty waitress never brought us a menu, so basically I had to ask the other, when she was taking care of other tables to bring us a drink, our waitress was makeing faces because we decided to sit next to the window... She basically did nothing for us the whole  time, ( we must have made her really angry w the table change) kept bringing me my check, because she is leaving , I said; we not leaving yet, so just give the tab to the other girl,( whom actually took care of us anyway) she didn't, half hour later she brought out the check telling us now she really have to go so pay up ?!? I couldn't be more dissaponted....don't recomend the place at all, last couple times always big disappointment with the service, it's not like what it use to be.....if you want good service DON'T GO TO MIKES......"}
{"text":"Laid back place with old world architecture. Deep colors and rich wood accents accented by old English brick. Broccoli and cheese soup is absolutely amazing.  The Thai calamari is great but overpowered buy thesauce accompanying it."}
{"text":"Nice place for a good burger and a few beers!  I really like the small pub feel!  Nice craft beer selection, too!  Service is good and prices were very affordable!"}
{"text":"Although I did not eat,  the menu looked great (had late and big lunch ).  Atmosphere is Coooooool  :)    service was superb. HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a week or so, and stopped by here a few times due to the reviews. Simple menu but great tastes. Great selection of craft beers. It seemed to always be busy and the staff were very friendly. Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, awesome beer selections. Also a private room is available for parties. Games were on TV and a great bar for everyone."}
{"text":"Didn't experience a ton while here for a family members event in the party room, but, bartenders were extremely fast and nice, and the selection of beer was excellent with Oatmeal Sout on nitro, many local beers, and a lot of IPAs. Good atmosphere also."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this bar, our waitress Michele was very welcoming and wonderful ....will be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is great... I go for lunch often. Try the meatloaf and you won't be sorry. I love these mom and pop places. Great job!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Mike's! A wonderful local place in the Berea business district. It's so easily overlooked because the outside is nothing too impressive but you'd be a fool to come through Berea and not stop here!  The environment can change pretty significantly depending upon when you go there- it's great for a weeknight dinner or even lunch but if you go there on a Friday or Saturday night it gets overrun by Baldwin Wallace University student around 9pm so it gets much more crowded and louder. Otherwise though they consistently have a pretty good crowd there but you don't usually have to wait to be seated. They have bar seating, tables, high tables, and a really nice, large desk that's open during the summer. Pretty nice lax, laid-back environment. The servers seem to change pretty frequently but they are always very friendly, accommodating, and fast. They also have a large room near the entrance that can be opened up for large groups. It's a great place to go with just one friend, but I've been there with 20 people- they seated us in the larger room and the service was just as quick as usual. Only downside- that room is not air conditioned!  I've had appetizers, entrees, salads and burgers and there is NOTHING I wouldn't recommend here- it is all delicious. My favorite is the tortellini in the entree's section- it has a cheesy cream-based sauce and peas, tomato and bacon. Very good. Nice sized portions- not too much but enough to fill you. The entrees all come with a salad and they have a number of really delicious made-from-scratch dressings- I'd recommend the pear vinaigrette- very good and refreshing.   Mike's carries a lot of imported beers, ciders and malt liquors that you won't find at a lot of other places but they of course have domestics, mixed drinks, wines, and beers on tap. Their ciders though are great and I'd definitely try one if you're into that.  Great place, probably my favorite local spot in Berea and I've lived here for three years. Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Mikes is probably the best bar in Berea. The food is amazing, and there is a great selection of beers no one else has. HOWEVER, I had one of the worst experiences at a bar ever when I was at mikes last night. I was accused by a new bartender of breaking a glass and I never knew anything about it. I then asked to speak to a manager not the owner and he did nothing about the situation. I normally never complain either. I have been going to mikes frequently over the past 5 years and they will no longer get my business and I encourage everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Our fav neighborhood bar in downtown Berea. Great food and friendly atmosphere. Try the Santa Fe burger with fresh sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Great rotating beer selection. Good bar type food. They also do special events for beer week and other good national breweries."}
{"text":"I Love this place! It is just a great  local friendly bar. I have always had terrific service and never had a problem with attitude from the staff actually just the opposite is true. The food is always solid with a great juicy burger and I love their Salad on the Cobb with blue cheese. I've also ordered take out an number of time because I work around the corner and it's always been just about the same quality as dining in., which I appreciate because there's nothing worse than starving and opening up your take out and it's a disaster.   The Craft beer selection is one of the best on west side. They rotate the selection frequently for  the seasons which is awesome. And they have a unbelievable variety of styles Pales, IPA's, Belgiums, Porters, Stouts, lagers., you name it they will generally have it. I recently went there for a Founders event for CBS and had a great time. This is super special limited release beer and they got the only keg in the state...pretty cool!!!  I love beer and usually drink that but they do knowledgeable bartenders that can make a mean martini according to my mother in law.   Being in the restaurant industry for years I rate according to the philosophy, quality, service, cleanliness of the place. I give Mike 5 because in 5 years I've never had a bad experience and for being a local gathering place it hits the nail on the head every time. I know I can go there at 2;30 on a Tuesday or 7:00 on Friday and get a great beer, a great burger or sandwich or salad and have great service. What more do you need?  O thats right a banging Patio in the summer... I forgot that.."}
{"text":"This place rocked! We were here late and starving. Our food was good (way better than most late night food), wait was reasonable, service was awesome, and we're beyond stuffed!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and the word is out because it was a 40 minute wait.  We got lucky enough to sit at the bar immediately and enjoyed numerous craft beers.  The bar tender was very helpful and knew her beer.  The food was outstanding for pub food.  Definitely a place we would go back to."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say about Mike's? A LOT!  Hubs and I found ourselves kidless last night so we thought to ourselves DATE NIGHT! WOOHOO! So we did the coin toss between two places we've been meaning to check out and Mike's won out. I think hubs and I won out too.  Mike's is a great corner spot in the middle of Baldwin Wallace Campus in the heart of Berea. It's a bar not a restaurant. No, it's a restaurant not a bar. No... it's both but it looks more like a bar and sounds a lot more like a bar. It's Located right on Front street. We parked by Dick's Bakery and strolled down the road to hit our pick.  We got there around 6:30 and the place was already packed. Tables were filled with moms and dads with little kids in tow, college kids at nearby tables, a gorgeous elderly couple just beyond them and a bar lined up shoulder to shoulder with patrons, young and old! I was struck by the variety of customers!   We waited for a table for about twenty minutes, were seated by our awesome server at a very recently vacated table and then menus in hand we started down the path to culinary delight!   Drinks came quickly, stout for hubs and root beer for me. Forget ordering root beer on tap, get the bottled! Nice rich birch beer! Hubs got the Philly Steak and I got the Burger.   Our eyes popped at the size of the onion rings we ordered, easily 2 1/2\" thick slices! Tasted amazing on top of being ginormous!   The Philly was amazing, tender, juicy, dripping in cheese and smothered in onions and mushrooms. If you're a Philly native and missing home then stop on in!   The burger was cooked perfectly, medium with a touch of pink, juicy to the point of sopping through the bun, the flavor was heavenly! Almost like I was enjoying a perfectly seared steak. Lordy it was good!   If only I could breathe after inhaling that monster burger! Whew! It took some time and effort but I did finish it!   Now, food aside, let's get back to our fellow diners. An older couple were seated next to us right before our food arrived. We exchanged polite smiles as we were seated only a foot away from them and that's when our Food arrived.   So we're stuffing our gullets and that's when the lovely woman asked how we were enjoying dinner, and of course we were like mmph mmmph so good (mouths stuffed).  Her hubs starts telling us they've been coming here since the joint opened 10 years ago, knows Mike the owner and Mike the chef. Mike the owner comes over to check on them, gets introduced to us, and makes sure we're well taken care of. We visited with our new pals next to us for the next 45 minutes or so, finished our meal, had another round of drinks and then waddled off to our parking spot three blocks away. THANK GOD we decided to park so far down the road. We soooo needed the exercise after our deep dive into our meals!   Anyway, can you tell we had a great date night? Go to Mike's, you'll have fun and a good meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when you don't feel like cooking and want to go to a casual place. Definitely NOT typical bar food! They have a great menu and casual atmosphere. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting. I have eaten here many times and have also gotten takeout. Love it and will go back many times! :)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the fried pike.  Very good and the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are awesome. Large beer selection. Server, I think her name was Samantha, was on point.  My only complaint is it is a bit tight in there but there is a cool neighborhood bar vibe going. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because I don't know how to do 4.75. It is amazing for the food, friendliness and cleanliness. The only thing is that it is a smaller pub with limited seating. Most of it is the high tables and chairs. But that's about the only drawbacks for me. I had the mushroom gnocchi dish with a side salad. It was not just any side salad. It was big and had a great mix of greens, cucumber, carrots, etc. not a standard crappy iceberg lettuce, tiny plate like most places. The pasta dish was out of this world good. The gnocchi was cooked right. The Gorgonzola cream sauce was rich and had a strong cheese flavor. It was soo good! It had plenty of mushrooms and bacon in the sauce and diced tomatoes as a garnish. I loved every bite. My wife got a huge chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was juicy. These were the best sweet potato fries I've had anywhere out. Everything was prepared perfectly. They must have an amazing cook. The music was low enough to enjoy a good conversation which I loved. I hate going out to eat and having to yell to talk. Not here. There was places to park on the street on in the back. If my next experiences are similar I will be a loyal returning customer."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, pretty chill place.  Overall seems like a pretty standard bar and grill.  Good place to catch some beers and watch the game.  Has more character on the inside than \"chain\" type places... very warm and welcoming atmosphere.  Food was fine... nothing to write home about... but not bad by any means.  Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cozy little bar, not fancy, but comfortable.  The sliders I had were delicious. Not flimsy line some places. Very tasty. Service was excellent. Our waitress was efficient & friendly. This place was mentioned to us by a friend, I would have never known it was there. Some of the other menu items they were bringing out looked delicious, large servings. I will definately be back to try something else. :)"}
{"text":"Mike always has the best tasting food around with take home portions and great staff. Mike the owner takes pride in making sure you get the best for your money. He greets you like one of his family to his quaint resturant. Dont pass up an opportunity to enjoy his home cooked cusine that will always have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I was here with a group of colleagues.  I happen to love the college town bars and restaurants and this one doesn't disappoint.  Three kinds of fries, great burgers, and great atmosphere.  I would gladly stop here any time I was in Berea."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"under the radar\" local gastropubs. Right on the front Street \"strip\" in downtown Berea, this joint really cranks out some fantastic eats.  The menu is not extensive, but what they do have they do extremely well.  You can NEVER go wrong with anything they have on their monthly specials menu...usually some kind of salad, sandwich, wrap, entree.  My personal favorite menu item is the chicken parm sandwich...thick cut, grilled texas-style toast surrounding a huge chunk of grilled chicken breast topped with just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  Yummers!!!  Another favorite of my lunchtime dining partners is the black bean burger, it always seems to be a hit. And generally speaking, all their burgers are rock-solid.  Prices are reasonable and the service always friendly.  Give them a try sometime!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, I wish I lived closer to it.  Whenever I go there I order their burgers because they are delicious.  I get the basic burger usually with bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg.  The fries are the hand cut variety.  The meat of the burger is well seasoned and cooked to temperature.  The burgers are juicy but not to the point where you get a soggy bun.  The bar is very nice and the servers are friendly and attentive.  They make sure to check on you several times.  Overall, I have never had a bad experience here and if I lived closer I would be here weekly for sure."}
{"text":"Always great food, staff, and beer selection. The beers change frequently with the seasons. They always have monthly specials on their menu. Prices aren't too bad either. A couple tvs for sports. Within walking distance from downtown Berea where there are some shops and other places to see.   Also a nice back patio open during summer months."}
{"text":"So thirteen years creeps up pretty quick in a marriage. Thankfully my wife isn't high maintenance. She requested that for our anniversary that we just try someplace we haven't been before for a really good bar burger. So I turned my fellow Cleveland yelpers and started reading their reviews.    We wanted to stay close to home so I focused around the Strongsville area. After reading lots of reviews of several places I opted for Mike's. The reviews I read were wonderful but, it truly was the uploaded photos that made up my mind. We parked in the public parking lot and walked over to the bar. This place is pretty small inside but well-kept and very clean. We strolled in about 6:15 on a Saturday night and only had to wait about five minutes for a table.     The place was packed. There was also a private party going on in the upper room from the entrance. Despite all the craziness of the packed restaurant and a private party going on the service was excellent.    They had an extensive beer list. It's always nice to have more than three or four choices. Wife and I both ordered burgers. Nothing fancy........ When I saw other tables orders coming from the kitchen I instantly liked what I saw. Our burgers came out relatively quick and were cooked to perfection. Mike's is a solid four star burger joint. They even have a kids menu so the wife and I will be bringing our son the next time we go."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 or 3 times and each time had a good experience. I had the mushroom gnocchi twice and each time loved it. They have a good selection of craft beer and a full bar. I have also came here for dinner with a large group and the service was very good."}
{"text":"visit on 11/21/2016    This is one of the best local bar and grills I've ever stopped into. From the friendly service to the the great menu to the interesting selection of beers, everything was top notch. If you are in the area for any reason and want a great dining experience - I'd recommend you try Mike's."}
{"text":"Last night I had the chance to ring in Cinco de Mayo and the beginning of graduation week  at my alma mater (Baldwin-Wallace College) in small town Berea (some family members/friends are finally done).   Along with Cornerstone Brewing Company, this was one of my favorite joints during college. It was good to reconnect with old friends, I definitely needed it. I also forgot they conveniently don't list ABVs next to their feature microbrews, which led to continued frivolity.    Humorous to the extent that I never fail to show my true colors: I went with Southern Tier's Jahva (and rediscovered? lol) what IPA -Imperial Ale - means: 10.6% ABV and a $13 surprise when the tab came. Best foot forward, right?    So I slowed to a crawl for the next one, which was markedly less preposterous at 10.0 ABV, piqued by the sound of New Holland's Dragon Milk. Which is indubitably my new favorite beer.   The shenanigans continued with an authentic, Mexican meal (my dude Scott in Mexico would be proud):  Pipin' hot, Dry Cajun Rub chicken wings (which literally melted in your mouth) with bleu cheese ...And house fries because apparently they don't have sweet potato fries anymore, or were out (I didn't really check).   Great food, great friends...and a follow up at my place with a few Goose Island Summer ales.  DERP."}
{"text":"Great service and great burgers. Cozy little bar where you feel right at home. They're beer list is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This would not be my first choice when picking a place in Berea or nearby.  First of all, the acoustics are terrible, which can make it hard to carry on a conversation at times.  Second, the seating is way too tight.  Almost every time we come here, we are seated at a table near the bar with people's butts right in our face. Third, the drinks are way too expensive.  I ordered a vodka and tonic that was $10!  Granted, it was Absolut vodka, but that's a little steep for a small neighborhood joint.  They do have some of the best calamari around, but other than that, the menu is not all that impressive.  I ordered Salad on the Cob the last time we were there, thinking it was just a play on words and was actually a Cobb salad.  Nope, it was actually a salad with corn in it, some of the usual Cobb salad ingredients (blue cheese was not one of them), but overall nothing special.  The pear vinaigrette was really good, but pretty much got lost in the oversized salad.    On a positive note, our waitress was Vickie, and she was a gem.......super friendly and attentive.  I wish there were more waitresses like her!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Cleveland Food Show with two kids in tow.  We walked in and the place has a nice atmosphere for a bar.  Lots of wood and a kind of a \"Cheers\" feel to the joint.  We were told at the door that there were only high tops available and we'd have to make do with the kids.  interesting approach- not very friendly.  The service here stayed unfriendly the whole time.  Granted, she looked overworked being the only server in the place, but there was a pretty long wait between ordering drinks and food, particularly with two kids around the 2 year range.    The food was average but better then some other bars I have been to.  All three of us ordered burgers and all were cooked to the right temperature rather than being overdone.  I would say that the standard fries are the best in the place, with a nice crisp coating.  The sweet potato fries were a little underdone and the \"house cut\" fries were dried out.    Loved the beer choice though- excellent craft beers on tap.  Had two different stouts that were both really tasty.  Whoever handles their beer selection should get a pat on the back.    I've been to a couple other places in the area that edge this place out a little- Cornerstone Brewery being high on the list- but for a decent burger and good beer, this is a nice place to go."}
{"text":"This local bar/restaurant is top notch! Mike is a great guy serving good food. I love the local vibe this bar offers. You'll see college kids from BW mixed with various locals. I've attended birthday parties here as well as a quick lunch with a friend. The burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Let me say first, I like this bar. I like the patrons; I like the atmosphere; I like the proximity to the airport and my abode. The food is decent, too. The only thing That can be wacky is the pricing. One night last fall I ordered a bottle of Pumking, not really giving it much thought. Turns out it was near 20 bucks! I don't even like Pumking that much, just wanted a quick buzz. Should have done a couple shots instead.All in all a nice place in a good area."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here on his birthday because they have a black bean burger. We are vegans and don't eat any oil. Our server was friendly at first but as soon as we started asking questions about ingredients she turned surly.  Most everyone around us had big greasyburgers, and fries loaded with cheese. I guess eating healthy isn't something she's used to. The burger  was mediocre at best. They also had workmen finishing a room next to the main dining room. Pretty noisy. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"First time and what a pleasant surprise. Excellent food & selection of beers. I had a turkey Reuben and others had salmon. All we're great."}
{"text":"This place is a sports bar.  The food was good but the atmosphere was horrible.  We could not have a conversation at the table because people around us where all watching a ball game."}
{"text":"Mike's Bar & Grille is a great local joint where you can go grab a beer & watch a game.  I have been several times and keep going back.    The menu is decent.  I haven't experienced bad food, but nothing super stellar either.  All & all if you're going for decent bar food or something a bit better than that, head over to Mike's.  A side note here:  I did have an amazing chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream one night.  Hit the spot to be sure. There are usually 5 or so beers on tap and they rotate.  What they had today may not be there yesterday, so keep going back to try new things.  Many bottles available to try too.  Some you can't find at just every bar.  Mike's is strangely and nicely stocked with variety. The service is friendly and they'll even deal with you if you're a bit pickier w/ the food.   All in all, an a-ok place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to go.  You will never get a bad meal at this place.  I recommend the Black Bean Burger or the Jam Burger.  Both outstanding!  Great beer list and rotate often.  The bar tenders are very friendly and very attentive.  This is a must go to place!"}
{"text":"Best turkey Reuben I've ever had.  And a local IPA that was fantastic (Fatheads JuJu).  Highly recommend this place.  I'm a road warrior and was lucky to find this place for great good and basketball game on the TV.  Quaint bar/grill atmosphere and the service was down home.  What more could anyone ask for??"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was phenomenal!!!  My wife and I will definitely be back again!  We ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls, and burgers.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"July 5th this year my girlfriend and I wanted to stop for a beer in Berea. We walked from my moms house on E Bridge st to the Eastland Inn but it was closed because of the previous days holiday. That was our #1 pick. after trying both the Cornerstone and Wing Warehouse (both closed) we decided to settle on Mike's Bar and Grrrrr.  We walk up to the outside patio bar (inside was locked) and asked the barmaid for the specials. She responded with \"you're at the wrong bar for specials.\" Nice. I reminded myself that this was my FOURTH place pick that night and got a pint of bud light in a plastic solo cup and sat at the patio furniture.  I've been back a few times since and was even there before that night. Decent food, try the calamari, but the rest of the overall \"meh\". I really only go when friends are already there, but the last few times my friends were ready to leave as i walked on the deck. The selection of bottled beer is ordinary and on the higher end of prices around this area.  There are four bars within walking distance from my mom's house, this will always be my fourth pick."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Great food! Chicken caprese is the bomb! Beer selection is always above standard!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent selection of beer, friendly staff, clean place, nice patio that is dog friendly. This is exactly what a bar & grill should be. By far one of the best places on the SW side."}
{"text":"My wife and I go every Friday for dinner.  We have for at least the past 5 years. The food is always great. The monthly specials keep the menu from being stale, like some other local spots. Taps are always rotating with great craft beers. The staff is always friendly and they are attentive to your needs.   I have to question the validity of a review by Bryan D giving Mikes a star because of a juke box?  Wow."}
{"text":"Third time here and haven't been disappointed yet. Great atmosphere, great food, great beer selection. Very small place and fills up fast, so get here early or be prepared to wait.  Meatloaf melt special is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We had: the \"green salad\" with feta, red onion, raisins, some kind of delicious nut and delicious vinaigrette ... Simple burger which was perfect... And the Sante Fe burger which blew my mind!!!!! It is half burger half chorizo with grilled peppers and onions with a very spicy chipotle sour cream. The best chipotle sour cream I've ever had.   Service was quick, our glasses never even reached half empty.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Mike's is consistently good. The menu is limited (try the meatloaf, seriously) but everything is prepared well. The beer selection is very, very good . The place can get a little crowded but the line moves pretty quickly. I don't think I've ever had bad, or even mediocre service. Waitresses and bartenders are consistently friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Go to Mike's, watch a game, order the Sante Fe burger (chorizo and beef) or Black Bean burger, order a craft beer, devour it, thank me later.  This is honestly, the best place to eat in Berea.  I wish they would open the back room for regular diners instead of special events, but even the smaller dining room give a nice vibe.  Expect to wait 20 minutes or so in the smallish waiting area by the front door, but you can strike up a conversation with other regulars.  Parking can sometimes be a pain, but look for a spot on the street in front or the smaller lot in the back.  Nice craft beer selection and very tasty food.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great little place.  They have a good beer selection.  They have a decent menu with good options.  The sandwiches are served with fries fresh cut beauties.  There are options including sweet potato fries.    The burgers are half pound, fresh ground and juicy.  I choose a sante fe burger.  This is half ground beef and chorizo, topped with grilled onion, roasted red peppers,  and pepper jack cheese.  Definitely worth the $9.  The have a peroigi plate for the non meat person.  Four large with onions and butter.  The place is small.  I eat outside. But indoor seating is available as well.  On weekends plan for a wait.  Grab a beer or drink, you'll get seated by the time it's finished usually."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed. Monthly specials are always great! Buffalo egg rolls are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Mike's is my new favorite place. I first visited them a few months ago and had a really nice experience. Why no review back then? I guess I was feeling hesitant.You see,  I've been bitten by the sophomore slump quite a bit lately - places where the second visit makes the first appear like it wasn't even the same place - and I wanted to make sure Mike's was the real deal. After my second visit I'm happy to report - they are.  Mikes is the kind of place that makes me happy to be an adult. There are some other places that tend to make me feel more like I should be there chaperoning some kids on their first teenage date rather than hanging out with my wife enjoying a quiet dinner and drinks. Not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just that it's nice to have a place where I can hang out with my peeps. You know, the 40+ crowd. Folks like me who are more interested in having an actual conversation with our tablemates than of trying too hard to be hip or score. For me, I think I've found this in Mikes.  Mikes is located just a stone's throw from another of my favorite Berea joints, Cornerstone Brewing Company. I know people throw around the word \"quaint\" when they want to put a positive spin on \"small\", but Mike's really is quaint. The whole place probably doesn't seat more than 30 people, and that's including the bar. That being said, we've never felt crowded in during our visits. It has a homey, warm feel that makes you want to linger a bit longer than you should.   During our two visits, the service was spot on. During our first visit we sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly, knowledgeable about the beer selection and quick to make sure my beer glass was never empty for long. Our second visit found us seated at a table in the center of the room and the service was just as good. I get so tired of being made to feel like I'm imposing or inconveniencing servers at restaurants. At Mike's the hospitality is so natural you feel like you're at a friends place.  The food at Mike's is definitely more than you'd expect from a small, local tavern. Sure, there's some of the usual suspects - wings, burgers, wraps - but there's also a host of surprising additions like Thai calamari, crispy fried calamari rings tossed in spicy Thai chili sauce and served over noodles, and specials like Croque Madame, a pan fried ham and Swiss cheese sandwich served with a perfectly cooked egg on top. During our most recent visit we enjoyed the mushroom gnocchi and the special French Onion Soup burger (crispy potato sticks, creamy mushroom/garlic aioli, provolone cheese).  Sure, the food's not perfect. The gnocchi was a bit dense and our burgers haven't exactly been cooked as ordered, but every dish is flavorful, well-seasoned and generously portioned. Another minor annoyance for me was how they had their extensive bottled beer list hand-written on a large board hung high up on the wall next to the bar. It was very difficult to read and made ordering a challenge. They've since added a printed bottles list full of great details, so kudos for that.  Speaking of beer, there's definitely a craft beer bar bent to their selection. They may only have a half dozen or so taps, but each one is filled with a delicious craft beer. I'm not even sure they carry any macros. The bottles list is pretty impressive with probably close to 100 different varieties to choose from. For a beer geek like me, this is a very good thing. During both visits I managed to have several beers I'd never enjoyed before.  Mike's is one of those places that's probably more for the locals than anything else. I'm also pretty sure that's how they want to keep it. While I'm not really local, I'll happily continue to make the short drive from Old Brooklyn. It's probably better that we don't live closer for both our waistline's and pocketbook's sakes. Mike's laid back vibe and surprisingly good food selection (did I mention they've got a great craft beer selection) are definitely two things that will have us coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers good food friendly service real nice patio excellent place to stop in for a quick drink and a meal"}
{"text":"It is a nicer local bar with better food than most. The sweet potatoe fries are worth every penny and they go great with a sweeter ale. They usually have a few cool different beers on draft. The only thing I don't like is that there are a few very mean bartenders there. They give you a little attitude and charge inconsistently. Not cool in my book. It also gets pretty crowded on a good BW drinking night."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding.  Love the atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  If you have not tried, add it to your must do list."}
{"text":"I love Mike's! It's my hometown bar and I think you'll love it too. Mike always has tons and tons of great beer in the cooler and on tap from all over the US. If you like hops then Mike's is the place for you. You will always have a choice of dozens of hoppy brews from all over.  The food at Mike's is also great. Mike has a standard menu of bar fair that you might expect. The food is always great, fresh and well prepared. Try the little Mike's or the steak salad with A1 dressing - awesome.  Now not only does Mike have the standard fair he does a monthly menu each month that is always fun and has something on it you'll love.  The girls behind the bar are friendly and lovely. You may even see big Mike in there too. So come on down to Berea and check out Mike's and the other great spots we have downtown. You can park and walk all over. Tell 'em Keith send ya!"}
{"text":"Decided to get out of Tremont and find some beers and some food.  My friend and I decided on Mike's, due to the fact that the last time I was there I had one of the best burgers I've ever consumed.  Too bad it was a special. This time I went overboard and got the ridiculous Stack Attack burger.  2 pounds of meat, a bunch of melty American cheese, crisp smokey bacon, and loads of regret.    The beef patties were moist and juicy and very flavorful, I could only make it through about 1/3rd of this delicious monstrosity but every moment was pure burger bliss.    Other tables gawked at the size of my meat.   The service was attentive and fun, the food has been amazing both times I have been there, and the beer was the perfect temperature.    I'll end this review as I will with all further reviews.  When we left, my friend Erika was hammered and I was full."}
{"text":"Always a friendly bartender (if not mike himself). The beer I originally ordered had just ran out. My bartender was super helpful in getting me something I'd enjoy.  The burger was done perfectly, fries were crispy and fresh....pretty straight forward and par for the course here.   Love the local \"hidden spot\" vibe here. Highly encourage a visit here."}
{"text":"What a great place that continues to impress me with a variety of new specials and great variety of craft brews. The Friday evening Pike Fish Fry was the best fish I have had in a long time as it was so prepared well."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon with my cousins for some drinks. Only had beers, but the menu was pretty impressive, the waitress was knowledgable and overall the service was good. As we were leaving, the place was getting packed. next time we'll stay and eat."}
{"text":"Went here late on a Saturday night. The environment has a nice local bar feel. The food is good. My family ordered a variety of items including burgers and mushroom gnocchi. The salad that comes with the gnocchi is a very large and fresh salad."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorite places to eat in Berea. Everything we have eaten here has been delicious.  Our favorites are the buffalo chicken egg rolls and steak salad. The beer selection is nice too. If its too busy, order take out, the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Great local bar with great food and it's own great personality.  Huge beer selection, staff is fantastic, a rarity in today's world. Try any of the food items you won't go wrong.  I  love the Thai Calamari app, the Hot brown is out of this world."}
{"text":"Mike's has a cool gastropub vibe. The menu is simple with burgers, sandwiches, apps and dinner entries. I built my own burger, which is a menu option, with bacon and a fried egg. Add fresh cut fries and I had a delicious meal. They also have a great beer selection of microbrews in bottles and on tap. Even though I heard this place gets crowded with BW students after classes, I would suggest this place to anyone. Front Street in Berea is looking pretty nice these days with establishments like this."}
{"text":"The menu is simple enough as to not be overwhelming, and ensuring high turnover and fresh ingredients, but diverse enough for all tastes, diets (veggie, vegan, GF).  Everything I have had is EXCELLENT, and during March/April, their Northern Pike dinner is to die for!   Furthermore, they have a great, rotating seasonal craft beer selection, which is by far the best I've seen for the size of the establishment. 6 or 8 solid craft choices on tap at all times and bottles bottles bottles.   Finally, the service is truly remarkable. Everyone is so friendly and invested in what they're doing, and how YOUR experience is. Also, the OWNER himself is always there with a smile on his face, doing everything from cooking, busing tables, serving drinks and greeting and chatting with customers.   Such a great atmosphere!  Note: The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a thing to be critical of here. We, and everyone who entered, was greeted warmly as they walked in the door. The atmosphere is a cozy and casual bar with a few TVs mounted on the beautiful, old world style bar backdrop. The bar area had all high top tables for gathering and hanging out. There was also a dining area that wasn't open when we were there with regular table seating. Everything was clean, right down to the restrooms, and freshly decorated.   We ordered 3 draft beers, a double rocks drink, an appetizer, a burger with fresh cut fries and a second side of sweet potato fries. Our bill came to $43. The girl working the bar was very helpful in making suggestions based on our questions and seemed to know the regulars and what they would order. She was very friendly with us first timers and the regulars. The burger that we ordered, upon suggestion, was EXCELLENT. It was juicy, perfectly seasoned & cooked to order. They never freeze their burger meat is what we were told and you can taste it. We also tried the buffalo chicken egg rolls based off other reviews. They were different from any other I've had. It was more in the style of a fried burrito in a flour tortilla. The stir fried celery and cabbage in it gave it that hint of Asian flavor with the buffalo chicken. Well done on this. It was also delicious!   I wish this was closer to me, I'd be a regular! I highly recommend Mike's."}
{"text":"Great food, beer selection, staff, environment --- really one of my go to local restaurants --- monthly menu change keeps things fresh and in season.  If you go between 6 and 8 you will wait for 30-60 min on weekends--- if your upset by this go to Mcdonalds, they have a drive through ... Ha.  I usually get a beer while I wait ---   Check it out if your a local."}
{"text":"Went to Mike's wanting a few things we saw pictures of here on Yelp. NONE of the things I wanted were still on the menu. Ugh. Bummer  My husband ordered the Thai Calamari appetizer. It was really good. Spicy and delicious. For dinner he ordered the Santa Fe Burger - it was a little more done then he likes his burgers, but it had to be because of the sausage that's in the burger. It was spicy and yummy he said. Nice blend of flavors   I ordered the A.G. Burger. I changed my cheese to American instead of PepperJack. It was really good the BBQ Sauce wasn't my favorite, but the burger was done correctly and tasted good  Our server asked if we wanted dessert, I said no. Hubs asked what it was. When we were told it was a brownie stuffed with peanut butter with ice cream we ordered two!!  STAY FOR THE DESSERT!!! Soo good!!!"}
{"text":"Ambience is inviting, lighting is intimate, noise level  toletable for having chatting and music. Food was good! Got the green salad with pear vinaigrette, out table also ordered the meatloaf which was reported \"okay.\" They give you plenty of food. Good  little cozy bar."}
{"text":"Mikes Bar and Grill is a great place to go to if you're looking for a nice, relaxing outside patio. The atmosphere here is charming & old-fashioned, and the location is awesome, it is close to surrounding cities & it's right by Wallace lake.  The menu is short and simple with delicious options. They have a huge craft beer selection with a nice outdoor patio and bar! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dry rub wings were great with homemade ranch. Shared the caprese chicken sandwich, which was really good. The hand cut fries are crispy and great too."}
{"text":"Heard good things and was not let down.  Good atmosphere and people.  Food was a OKAY and solid beer selection.  Highly recommended, big fan!  Just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Didn't actually sample too much here.  I was looking for a bar with good AC on a hot day and it was weak to nil here, so I walked out after a minute."}
{"text":"Awesome. Truly. We had four dinners and couldn't easily pick the best. Great gastropub."}
{"text":"Best burger I had in a long time.  Juicy and huge!  The fries were fresh made and outstanding!  Service was good,  too! The burger tasted like it was freshly ground and was at least an honest 1/4 pound."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed that this place didn't open until my last semester of undergrad, however I usually make a stop whenever I'm back in town. The food is great, the beer selection is decent, and the atmosphere is laid back. They have an amazing steak salad, decent burgers and sweet potato fries. So why not spend your hard earned money at a local establishment instead of in the chain restaurant madness that is Bagley Road?"}
{"text":"We have been to Mike's many times.   The food is exceptional.  Very flavorful, reasonably priced, and generous portions.  But what I come for is the beer selection.  Wow!!!!  Their draft beer selection has some unique selections.  Even their outdoor bar has some fine draft selections.  Speaking of their outdoor area.  When the weather is nice it is one of my favorite places to enjoy lunch.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We LOVE mikes, great service, great food!! Mike actually makes an effort to come around when he is there and make sure you're satisfied,we have NEVER had any bad food there what so ever, or bad service!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had a Sunday lunch here!  Turkey soup was very yummy and hit the spot on a cold day!  My mom had the meatloaf and I had a burger, both big portions.  We loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"Mike's takes bar food one step up. Their specials are always unique and delicious even could be called gourmet. Drinks can get costly but the food is worth the it. The atmosphere is like a old English pub, small, cozy warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Mike's Bar and Grill, how I love thee...let me count the ways:  1) Huge beer list with a great craft draft selection that changes each week at least.  2) Solid staff. Michelle, behind the bar, is the biggest sweetheart you'll ever meet. All the girls working there are super nice and willing to make food and beer suggestions, chat or leave you alone if you so desire.  3) THE FOOD. Mike's does bar food the way I dream about bar food. The sweet potato fries? Something fierce. The black bean burger? Too good. The actual burger? A juicy delight. Add a fried egg and Gouda, thank me later.  4) Mike, the owner, hangs around, serves food and gives high fives. Support this man because he supports Berea.  5) Ambiance. Jukebox full of good tunes, twinkle lights and old timey adverts.   This is the sort of place you gather friends. The sort of place you bring a the man in your life that loves a good stout. Or even the place you bring your mom for lunch.   If you find yourself in Berea and are in need of a good bite or a good beer...get to Mike's and snag a seat."}
{"text":"One of the best pub--type restaurants around. The staff is always friendly and attentive, your glass is never empty. I've never had a bad dish and it's worth mentioning that it's always nice when a pub attempts a decent salad menu and succeeds. It's always nice to see Mike shaking hands and kissing babies."}
{"text":"Great staple of Berea, good food and solid drinks.  Probably my favorite bar in the Berea, kind of a college bar, but worth the stop if you are in the area.   Way better than that flaming bag of garbage Bar 107"}
{"text":"Mike's was recommended to me by a friend and I will try almost everything once. When he was telling me about it, he suggested I get the meatloaf. He absolutely raved about it! I went against my better judgement and got the eggplant parmesan instead. The eggplant was cut way too thick so it was mushy. I may be an Italian food snob but I know good eggplant, and that was not it. Also the sauce was too thin. Almost tasteless on the pasta. A big no no with me.  My boyfriend had a the salad and was quite pleased with it. I know I should have ordered the meatloaf and if/when I return, that's exactly what I'll do. I will say that the starter salad and bread I had was delightful. The bread was warm and the dressing was very tasty.  I will most likely return for a redeemer visit."}
{"text":"I've only been to Mike's a handful of times, but I'm always happy when I make the decision to come! I was brought here in college for the first time by some of my friends who attended Baldwin Wallace. After that, every time I visited, I asked to go back. Keep in mind, this place is in the heart of BW, which fills it with college students. However, it's not your typical college bar. I still come here, 3 years after graduating college and still find it enjoyable. I've tried quite a few dishes here- from pierogis that are huge to a turkey Reuben to a buffalo chicken wrap. Let me tell you- no matter what you order, GET THE FRESH CUT FRIES! Hands down the best fries I've ever had. One of my favorites of the dishes I've tried would have to be the turkey Reuben. Everything you want in a Reuben, but slightly healthier! (At least that's what I'm telling myself). I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone, whether you're a college student or 3 or 10 or 20 years out."}
{"text":"One of the best bar/restaurants in the Greater Cleveland area. I have been frequenting this place for the last 9 years, and every experience has been awesome!   Our most recent experience was this past Friday. My girlfriend and I, were meeting my brother and a few friends, for some food and drinks. We got there early, and they were busy as usual, on a Friday night. The owner Mike, was seating everyone at the front door, and was extremely friendly with everyone. We told him we were early, and waiting on friends, and that there was no rush to seat us. Mike kept checking back with us, to let us know that he hadn't forgotten about us. (Sidenote: The rate that they turn tables is something to behold!) We requested a high top table, and coincidentally, right before everyone was about to arrive, one opened up and we were seated. The food and cocktails were delicious (We each had a few drinks, and shared some food), and as always, so was the service. I can't wait to come back for another great time!"}
{"text":"What a great place.. The menu is usual bar food, but the quality is soo much better.. You can taste the difference vs other places that don't make food fresh and in-house.  The falafel wrap was incredible, so is the bean burger.  I've never had bad food.. The monthly specials are absolutely awesome.. They have a great beer and bourbon selection.  Prices are very reasonable, service is always great.  The owner is there helping out, talking to customers often.  You can tell he cares about the customers, and not just making money.  Well worth it.."}
{"text":"Mike's is a gem nestled in Berea, OH. It's not only a very well decorated restaurant (love the beautiful wood that the bar is made out of) but it's full of charm. What I love the most about this place is it's great for families as well as a night out with adults. The food is awesome. There is a core menu that is always there that never fails to please. In addition, there is a monthly menu that is always unique. I have never been disappointed in anything I've ever ordered there. The staff is so friendly and nice. The beer selection is really outstanding especially for a place of this size. The staff is very knowledgeable about the brews and can also make a killer mixed drink if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland, Ohio for two weeks.   A couple of different friends recommended this place to me.  Great atmosphere, huge craft beer selection, outside deck that has great shade, What more can you ask for?  How about creative and tasty food!  I had 4 entrees here.  The Hot Brown was food channel worthy. I bought some home for my Dad and he didn't get to it in time. The Thai Calamari over noodles was great, so good I am going to try it at home.  My nephew treated me to the Fish fry.  I had one piece of Pike.  The fish was perfectly cooked. The breading held up through the whole filet.  No soggy mess here!  The Gnocchi Carbonara (Gnocchi with Bacon and white sauce) rocks.  I rarely sop up sauce but this white sauce deserves an extra piece of bread.  Looking for something different?  Mike's is the place for great tunes, helpful and smiling staff, great food and great beer offerings (bottle and tap) this is a Westside gem."}
{"text":"My song was skipped on the jukebox. Don't skip songs. You have a jukebox, people paid money. Super rude! Also, only hip-hop/R&B songs are skipped? Not a great look in 2017 fam. Yikes"}
{"text":"Nice bar definitely nicer than your average dive bar and the price reflects on that. Was really busy both times i was there but you can't knock them for that. 4/5"}
{"text":"My favorite local watering hole. Food is fantastic and they always have a great craft beer selection on tap. Frequent beer events like tap takeovers. They also have a brand new patio outside. Try the Thai Calamari. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a wonderful assortment of beer options, many from local breweries.  Great monthly specials.  Can get VERY crowded though, and there is no \"hostess\", so the seating queue can get kind of chaotic.  Bartenders and servers are great though.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was my first & many more to come visits great shady patio, friendly service, food cooked perfectly, I had calamari appetizer but brought out with my burger. Both were outstanding!!!! Loved the huge portion calamari appetizer & burger was the June Special with fried jalapeño & fried pickles with some sort of spicy sauce, it was great with the fresh cut fries. The service at patio bar was superb Ellisa was a fabulous server! I never went inside but can only assume it's cool. Try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great for Bar Food.  They have three different kinds of french fries.  That's cool in my book.    I've been here a few times to eat and e I've tried something new every time and enjoyed it all.  The Black Bean Burger is a must have, even for you carnivores.  Even my parents (whom don't frequent bars) really enjoyed the food.  I suppose Mike's is classified as a 'college bar' but it's very nice and not dirty and the bartenders have always been very friendly.  I've never been here during peak going out hours, mainly only to eat.  Always got a seat at the bar and enjoyed myself there.    The Berea \"Downtown Triangle\" is coming together a bit.  With Mikes, The Cornerstone Brewery, and Sweet Mango, they have a few really nice establishments.  I hope they continue to expand with local joints."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch on a Sunday. I had the meatloaf entree. came with fresh bread and a fresh salad. I didn't have any but they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Traveling to Cleveland and had time to kill. Traveled off the beaten path to find a restaurant local to the area. My GPS led me to Mike's. Wanted something different and found it here. Ordered the calamari over spicy noodles and was impressed with the flavors. Service was fair yet food made up for the lack of attention."}
{"text":"I have been house sitting for a friend in Berea all week. I have been to Mike's Bar twice now. The food is good. First time around, I had the Chicken Parmesan. This was a good choice because it was $10. It wasn't that great, wasn't that bad. It came with a big piece of Italian bread, butter and a nice size salad. All for $10. The place gets very busy and seating is limited. They had an impressive beer selection, offering many micro brews that I enjoy. The water out of the beverage gun is filtered. That is a good thing to know. I told the bartender that it had a weak stream, she explained why. The burgers are also good. I don't really have much bad to say about the place. It has nice white christmas lights adorning the walls and it creates a nice warm environment."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after reading all the great reviews. A group of us went. Took about 15 minutes to seat us. Service was good but the food was even better. We went on a Friday night, they had fish and chips special. We ordered that and then some. Loved the fries and buffalo chicken egg rolls. Oh, wings were pretty good too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good beer. No vegan options. I called today to confirm."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment based on reviews. Grabbed an open seat at the bar and order a house wine. Service was ok,  ordered my food and was served a short while later. Burger and fries were ok but not what was expected. Had to ask for water and then another wine pour. Got the bill and it was over $30.  For a burger fries and two glasses of house wine.  $11 per glass is a little rich for house wine in a local bar. I try to support local establishment when traveling but will not visit this one again."}
{"text":"I've often heard people say that they prefer Mike's to Cornerstone, which is just two blocks away. I don't get that. Mike's is cramped, dark, and loud. It doesn't have microbrews. The food is the same Northeast Ohio standard stuff: beef, chicken, fries (mix and match)."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Mike's! As every time the service is good as are the beer selections and food. We had the seasonal beef stroganoff which was pretty good. The Star of our lunch was the mushroom ravioli, omg this was amazing! Going back next week after the boat show and one of us will be getting that ravioli again!"}
{"text":"From the appetizers, main course to just the sides, My Family and I have never had a bad meal or bad service at this joint. It's like great bar food but to a whole different level of goodness. The salads are big, and there damn good. I've had every salad officially on the menu and they are hearty and creative.   Trust me, every plate goes out with pride!"}
