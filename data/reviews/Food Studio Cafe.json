{"text":"I've been back a few more times, and have to agree the quality has gone downhill. After a few subtle inquiries I heard that there has been some cost cutting and staffing changes behind the scenes. It's a shame, this place used to champion local food. Now it's just another corporate cafeteria."}
{"text":"I really like Food Studio for what it is.  It is a cafeteria style eatery located in the basement of the ROM.  I actually come here fairly often and have the following commentary:

1. This place is expensive.  Today I had a soup and a coke at it was $9.  That's a lot of money for a soup and a coke.  It will add up fast and don't forget you 10% ROM member discount!
2. Speaking of soup, their soup is GREAT.  I've tried many kinds and they always have veggie options, not that I care all that much because I'm not vegetarian.
3. They usually have a neat dish to go with their current exhibition.  I like this.
4. Their pre-made sandwiches are really tasty.  Try the eggplant and goat cheese.
5. A good selection of desserts are always available.
6. During the early school year it is quiet but once class trips start it gets busy.  And don't get me started on how cray cray it is in the summer!

I like coming here for lunch during my work day.  Would I come here on a regular weekend or go out of my way to go?  Of course not.  But if I am at work or at the ROM, this is my go-to.  I don't know if any of you remember what the ROM used to provide food wise pre-reno but I do and let me tell you, this is far more than a cut above that."}
{"text":"Well, maybe on weekdays this place has great food as per Aardvark K's review. But we were here on a Sunday afternoon, after seeing the Maya exhibit. Can you say deserted? There weren't many options that looked palatable. So I went for the veggie burger with fries. Oh my aching belly. I shouldn't have gone that route. The fries were all right. But the veggie burger was just gross. This is cafeteria style service so there isn't much to it. But the cook for my burger didn't really seem to care how he cooked my food. In my opinion, the best tasting food usually ends up being the kind that is cooked with love. Whether it's love of the art of cooking, or your loved one cooking something for you. Food that's not prepared with the same care just doesn't taste the same."}
