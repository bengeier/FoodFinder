{"text":"The Noodle Box serves up good sized portions of truly spicy (upon request) dishes that are delicious and fresh. The Kung Pao and the Black Bean and Garlic are really nice at medium hot. Tried the Naan bread appie today - excellent with the curry dip. I especially like that water is provided on tap free of charge instead of paying some ridiculous amount for a 500 ml bottle of Pure Life."}
{"text":"Great food! A little bit slow on it and lack of seating when busier is the only reason I can't give 5 stars but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was not disappointed. Showed up 5min to close (yeah.. im that jerk) and still received great customer service. Ordered the green curry with chicken (medium/hot) and the chicken teriyaki (medium). Both were fantastic, although next time I wont order anything hotter than medium -I could barely handle the heat!! Took the food to go but the decor is really nice inside the restaurant. I was also pleasantly surprised by how large the portions were. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try! :)"}
{"text":"Food and staff were incredible!  Have been to this location 3 times, on my last visit, when asked how my food was, I said good, but I expected it to be spicier.  It was still good food.  They insisted I receive a card for a free meal. (Completely unnecessary.).  So I will definitely be returning! Great price, taste, service!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up near Costco in Deerfoot Meadows. Note that if you google map the address, it shows the wrong location (somewhere in Shawnessy).  I had the Spicy Peanut Noodle Box with tofu. I found it really bland. I didn't ask for additional spice, but it was supposed to be mild/medium. The mildness was not the issue, but I found the sauce to be flavourless.  Also, there were too many noodles and not enough vegetables for my liking.  The biggest disappointment is the prices. It is really steep for what you get.  I might try a couple of their other dishes, mostly because the location is convenient for me."}
{"text":"I was hungry after an aborted trip to Costco ( crazy busy lines) and since Yelpers said this was a 4-star eat, I decided to check it out.  What it has going for it: Free sparkling water on tap Clean with modern decor Very smart and diverse menu. Not a lot of items but they picked the best dishes from the Asian region. Choice of 7 stirfrys, 4 soups/curries and 5 types of protein. Plus 4 appetizer-ish bites.   I ordered the Thai green curry, medium-hot. IT WAS HOT. I'm Nigerian and we're famous for our tolerance of hot food. Inspite of that, my nose was running halfway into this bowl! The curry itself was a nice one bowl meal but I couldn't finish it, it was so hot. Also loved the cherry coke   Not so good: Drinks are limited selection and pricy   All in all, a decent lunch experience."}
{"text":"Heard of this from a colleague... Took me a while to get myself here but am I ever glad I did!  It was delicious!!  I will definitely be back!  Sparkling water on tap a lovely addition. Love the personal touch when you come in and they ask if you have been there and they proceed to explain. . What a lovely lunch we had."}
{"text":"This is our go to place. Excellent food always fresh and professional friendly staff. If you haven't tried the spicy peanut pad Thai you are missing out! Their spring rolls and Naan bread are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"What a surprise!  I was under the mistaken impression this place was like a food court quality fast food Asian cuisine. I apologize Noodlebox!  Portions were large enough to get another meal out of them and SO good. Probably one of the better Pad Thai I have ever had in Calgary.   Definitely accurate in terms of spiciness and great fresh ingredients and fantastic flavor.   Huge bonus points for a help yourself water fountain (regular AND sparkling) and their cutlery is made of plant starch so you can chuck it in their COMPOST bin instead of the garbage.   Well done Noodlebox! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I never went in before ignorantly thinking that from the outside it kinda looks like a cheap fast food place that has never appealed to me enough to check it out! Well recently some friends brought a bunch of different varieties of their noodles over one day for us all to try. They were absolutely unbelievable to the point where i've been craving it for two weeks. I finally made the trek down today to check the place out for myself and was very pleasantly surprised to be warmly greeted by some dude came out around from behind the till to explain how the place works! Most places I go to I usually find my favorite thing and only ever order that! This is one of those places where I can't wait to go back and try everything! an added bonus is that they serve beer, but not piss beer, they serve great local craft beer! (A variety of village and red racer was available while I was there) This is an indicator to me of the kinds of decisions that most likely get made often in this place! Quality!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  So glad we finally have a hip place in this small town,  to enjoy a well prepared quick meal that is healthy and delish! With sparkling water on self serve tap. Great ambiance , decor and staff! Well done!! I also have to say those little take out boxes are really fun:)"}
{"text":"2 out of 4 of our dishes were burnt.Had to get a refund on them. The price I paid for mine the Spicy peanut noodlebox was just okay. Hardly any beef and you pay $3.50 extra for it.  Friendly service, food was sub par.  I wont be back.  The Noodlebox is currently on Groupon, but be aware that its for the Airdrie location not this one. Sorry , I wont be back."}
{"text":"Spicy peanut is great. Bright location with good music. Fast, friendly service. Fun to hang out and do some work on the laptop."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat; I'm so glad it isn't closer or I'd be there every day.  The food is fresh, fast, and delicious... But I think that the service surpasses the meals!  I have been a 1/2 dozen times and they know what I like, how I like it, and remember my name.  That means a lot to me.  I could get noodles in my neighborhood but choose to drive 7k because of the service (and the shrimp lettuce wraps).  I am addicted!  Also the complimentary on-tap spring water; what a great touch.  I just can't say enough great things about this place.  :)"}
{"text":"We love everything about noodle box as a rule; but what the heck has happened in airdrie?  The windows were smeared and greasy looking.  Fizzy water dispenser was crusted in lime deposits, and out of order.  My shrimp lettuce wrap smelled fishy; unheard of a noodle box!  The Tom yum soup was ok, and my grand daughter loved her child's noodle bowl; the lady came to ask about our meal, which was nice.  But the funky feel?  Gone.  The spirit has left the building.  Sorry.. I started this review before our food arrived, and I cannot seem to edit the title."}
{"text":"Had Cambodian jungle curry box...   delicious food and really good service... will visit again"}
{"text":"Amazing food and unique appeal.  This restaurant combines fresh Asian cuisine with up beat modern dining experience for a great meal to stay or a box to go!"}
{"text":"First time at noodlebox! I'm a huge fan of noodles, so I was pumped to find this spot. The layout is pretty funky and fun. It was nice and quiet when I was in there as well.  What kind of ruined the experience for me was actually the cashier. She walked away from the till when it was my turn (and I was in a bit of a rush) so I had to wait for a while. I also found her to be a bit rude when taking my order. It seemed like the kitchen staff were really aware of her behaviour, though, and  would shoot me smiles and a cook came over to answer a question when she disappeared from the till again.  As for the food, my noodles were pretty delicious. I found it to be a bit on the pricey side ($10 with no protein) but I was definitely full and enjoyed my meal.   I don't think I would return again, but if you're in no rush and looking for good noodles, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Casual, fun environment. Quick & friendly service. Food was spot on! We will be back!"}
{"text":"For a fusion, non-authentic Asian place, it was pretty good. The spring rolls are good. Had the Vietnamese cucumber salad with spring rolls and it's basically \"bun cha gio\". The stir fry's are also really good."}
{"text":"Tom Yam was awesome! Lots of veggies and you can add organic tofu (^,^) they have nice drink choices, more natural and also they serve beer, the place looks clean and they separate the compost and do recycling, friendly service. We definitely will back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Vegetarian and Vegan friendly. Reasonable value for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Top  quality ingredients and a water fountain required if you choose the most spice of u life.  Amazing amounts of sauces.  Best asian box food"}
{"text":"NOODLES! (Box optional)  Well it's pretty much all summed up in the name. The noodles are delicious with varying heat levels to suit your fancy. It's the type of place where you walk up to the counter and then grab your seat after ordering. They also have fountains with still and sparkling water which is nice. Their sodas are definitely worth a try when you're there.  Lots of food for an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Nice food. Clean. I took the Thai style chow mein and it was pretty good. The price reasonable but a bit confusing as the price of protein is added separately from the main dish in the menu."}
{"text":"An absolute MUST TRY!! Vancouver Islands hottest food craze is here in Airdrie. Super Fresh food and very friendly staff. New Managment is making some great improvements! Noticeable difference in my dish - tastier than ever! Cambodian Jungle curry box for me. Crispy Shanghai Chicken, Spicy Peanut and Ginger beef for my boys - they all loved it!! Staff very friendly....can't wait for their liquor license to have beer & wings too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and the food and service have been excellent both times. What I really like about this place is that the spiciness of the food is authentic. Its not like most places where you ask for \"spicy\" and you get something that barely gives your tongue a tickle. If you get spicy here you're going to be sweating at the very least. If you go with the highest level of heat, prepare to have your day ruined.  Both times I've had the green curry with chicken. This was the first time I've had it with noodles as any other place I've had green curry its been served with rice. The dish is delicious, and though I prefer it with rice to soak up the sauce, noodles are a good option."}
{"text":"We needed a quick and healthy take-out option during a move and we ended up at Noodlebox. They have some great healthy options (re: protein/veggies/gluten free) and the servings are HUGE. You really could share one box between two people.   We ordered two boxes of noodles (one curry and one chow mein) and some ginger beef dumplings to share. This meal lasted us 3 days!! The food was very tasty, however, we definitely could have used more protein in each box."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love wild flavoured noodles in a bowl? Their food is outstanding and made with super fresh ingredients. I love to get their spicy Thai peanut bowl with chicken and medium heat. The bean sprouts crunch, the cilantro pops, and the peanut sauce is amazing. Definitely got to check this place out. They are very trendy with an environmental attitude. Practically everything here is compostable."}
{"text":"It's pricy but worth it.  Delicious and fresh. Come here all the time for clean eats. Def a great location, always super clean and staff is beyond helpful.  Love."}
{"text":"I have had almost everything on the menu here and it never disappoints. Concept is simple, pick a dish whether its noodles, soup or rice, add a protien if desired, choose a heat level (hot is actually hot!) And then wait a few mins for a large bowl that satisfies your appetite every time!!  Spring rolls and gyoza are both excellent, especially for the reasonable price."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place.   We tried the Cambodian jungle curry, Kung Pao and the fried rice.  We both eat spicy so we got two items hot and the kung pao scorching.  We got it as take out so the dishes might not have been as good after the car ride.  All three dishes were just alright.  The rice dish was very dry and kind of bland. The scorching didn't seem very spicy at first but it does creep up on you. My pick out of the three would probably be the jungle curry. We felt the the dishes were lacking in depth of flavour which is what makes the authentic food so tasty.  I'll just stick to the authentic places for my noodles craving."}
{"text":"Good place.    Drove by it and decided to try it.   I had the Spicy Peanut Noodle Box w/ pulled pork (which is their best seller).  Tasted very good and had a nice freshness to it.  Also had the Shrimp Lettuce Wrap for an appetizer...a little salty but very good. My wife had the Kung Pao (medium spicy) which tasted good but I thought it may have been a little too spicy.   Overall, good food & good service.   4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Noodle  Box and the two other restaurants in the same building. You can walk from the Noodlebox to Pardos and the Little Lot Cafe (not sure of that name).  You can check the menus and see what you like and which restaurant you would like to eat in.  I choose the Little Lot Cafe and it was good.  They do not have their liquor license yet, but plenty of sparkling drinks.  They had just opened so are just getting organized.  These restaurants are on 8th Street and 15th Avenue (where Ric's used to be).  Quite an interesting concept."}
{"text":"Asian fast food with a good vibe. Standard mix of rice and (shocker) noodle dishes with a choice of proteins. Prices range from 10-15$ for a respectably large bowl. Definitely a full meal. You select the spice level. Note! The spice levels are not your standard food court/shopping mall heat. Med/Hot gave me neck sweat and Hot made the Asian guy down the table break into full body sweats and head back for 4 glasses of water much to the amusement of his dining partner. The available 'Scorching Hot' level is best reserved for dares and hazing rituals. Food is prepared promptly in an open kitchen and service was fast. Dining music track was an loudly eclectic mix of 80's pop. Probably not a romantic date spot but if you were planning a first date night at a fast food noodle spot you have more game than me. Very good Tom Yum Soup and Thai Green Curry with fresh tasting ingredients. Defiantly will be back... Extras: -Both water and sparkling water complimentary from self serve dispensers -Customizable Kid sized noodle meal available so your little one won't burst on a full size bowl -Delivery available for a 4$ charge + 1$ debit/credit fee if you need noodles to come to you instead -BEER! Village brewery draft available to take the burn of the Pad Thai that you ordered 'Hot' spicy because you didn't believe me about the spice levels."}
{"text":"Nice surprise. Yelped the area and came up with Noodlebox. Fresh, great flavors and good sized portion for the price. Only downside was that they had run out of a couple of their appetizers due to a big dinner rush. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some noodles to go; the Pad Thai was fresh with just enough cilantro to compliment the spice.   I ordered medium spicy - if I come back, I'll kick up a notch to hot. I found the medium just barely \"spicy\" enough for me.   Restaurant was clean, with modern decor with a west coast meets Asian street food vibe. Noodle Box is a great alternative to all those fast food chains out there!"}
{"text":"Was okay. Nothing to write home about, and not quite worth the price.   I had the spicy peanut noodle box, with chicken and a fried egg. Lots of carbs, lots of sauce. Good amount of peanuts. Not a heck of a lot of veg. Ordered it medium spicy, which didn't seem very spicy to me."}
{"text":"What a surprise! My husband had had some noodles ordered in for lunch and he said it was great. We decided to head there for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. The flavours were delicious and the portions filling. It's 4 hours later and I'm still full!   The ambiance is great and I must say my favourite part was the garbage collection. Now to many, this may seem odd, but I live in one of the test communities for composting and I take it seriously. It is so refreshing to see companies taking the lead in protecting the environment. They provide great detail at the receptacles on how to divide your waste. It was simple to take the metal handles off the boxes and ensure that 98% of our waste went to the compost!   I will definitely return because there were so many options that I would love to try!"}
{"text":"With all of the new offerings in Deerfoot Meadows, this is a fresh and tasty choice.   Their bowls have REAL flavour, not like most of the other noodle places who only offer a bland teriyaki.   Noodlebox has nice spice and tasty combinations of flavours.   They are lacking in the portion size though - the bowls are large but there are not nearly enough vegetables in it. Will give it another try though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives  in Airdrie and when he is coming over he stops here and picks up food. I am Vegan and he is on his way. The people who run this place know what Vegan means and can tell you which meals are Vegan. It is flavorful and they even use tofu! The serving sizes in to-go boxes are large and so tasty. My guy likes that he can have a beer while he waits for the order to be cooked!  Thank you Noodlebox for"}
