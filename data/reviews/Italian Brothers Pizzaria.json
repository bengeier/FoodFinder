{"text":"We have eaten here 2 times now both times pizza was awesome and service was fast, friendly and accommodating!!  We love supporting local and personally owned places!!  We will keep supporting small business!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is  The 2nd time I've been here the 1st time we had pizza today was a meatball suband both were very good . Will  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak sub. It came on 2 hot dog buns. Can only assume that is the way they always make them since they didn't say they were out of sub rolls. It was lousy. Normally I give places a second chance , but I doubt if they'll get one. Don't mistake them as a Brothers Pizza. One star is generous based on this experience."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a chance after reading 3 good reviews out of 4 total reviews. Well our experience was awful. Walked in and it was so hot in the place, and the TV was blaring, about 6 kids all on tablets or phone playing games and yelling. Ok we still thought we would try the pizza but not stay to eat since the dining area was so dirty (tables were sticky and plates of food left on tables and counter)and noisy ( it was the owners kids, they really need to tone down the kids when customers come in). 
The menu (a post card) didn't really describe the different crusts so we asked the women told her we didn't want a real thin or pan crust, she then said I have a nice crust that is my best seller. Ok we ordered that. About 15 mins our boxed pizza arrives and we go up to pay, have to run the gauntlet though the kids and me saying excuse me three time for them to move out of the aisle.
We get to the car and my husband is like this doesn't feel warm he opens the box and we both look at it and it's a pan pizza, which we don't like and the cheese has already set it's not bubbling like a hot pizza should be. 

The pizza was clearly made earlier in the day and all they did was add the toppings we ordered and put it in the oven to heat. It was awful pizza, would never go back!!"}
