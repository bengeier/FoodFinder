{"text":"Great place !!! Food is awesome.... Lady at the register is really nice Best desert bar by a mill√≥n"}
{"text":"Hospitality and service was a great. As myself I tried        Just about all my plate would hold,fish, ribs roasted chicken and plate to full for roast beef.   We were  Antique shopping most of the day thanks with a smile on our faces..."}
{"text":"I was turned on to this place last May...and we've eaten here at least once per week ever since. I read the reviews that said the food wasn't good, and I don't know where those people ate or what they are used to eating. I've turned all my friends and family on to Market Street and they love it also."}
{"text":"YUK!  Unless you like chicken, chicken and more chicken, that is basically all your going to get. All the veggie seem like they came out of a can.  No flavor. Our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there at all. Not friendly, no smile, no communication. Mac and cheese tasted sour, chicken pot pie, had neck bones in it, meatballs.......God only knows what kind of meat was used to make them, desert......very blah, and not a selection at all, mashed potatoes tasted instant. Very limited with a selection of foods. The only good thing was the rolls. Price was $12.50 per person including drink, which the sweet tea was not sweet at all, and very weak.  I would not recommend this place.  Very disappointed in it. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Enjoy your Sunday thru Saturday lunch or dinner here.Not open on Mo day fried chicken to gizzards and smiles. My lunch thru the week is $10.50 and my dinner is $13.00 including my drink woth free refills ."}
{"text":"The best southern food I've tasted. I love how your family when your there. Cozy lovely place with delicious food."}
{"text":"Go with an empty stomach. Great food, good people! Eat there often and full when we leave! Would recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  it is hard for buffets to shine anyway.  Lot's of food contamination I saw plus the food taste was worse than Golden Corral at about the same price."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Food was nothing to brag about and service almost non existent. Won't go back."}
