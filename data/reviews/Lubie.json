{"text":"Based on reviews my wife and I decided to have dinner Saturday evening at this cozy restaurant. We greatly enjoyed our tasty meals. We knew only a little French but the owner was very friendly and she explained how each entree was prepared. My wife had the escargot as starter and the duck confit entree. Both we delicious. The duck confit was tender, moist, and flavorful. I started with a salad covered with a couple slices of lightly pan fried potatoes, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The salad was excellent. My entree was a teriyaki salmon. The salmon and vegetables were perfectly prepared and very fresh.
Payment by cash was not a problem since we were on the second day of our week long Quebec vacation. During our trip to Quebec we had chances to experience 4 or 5 French dinners in Montreal and Quebec City. Each dinner was excellent or very good. The meal at Restaurant Lubie is among our favorite."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe. Service courtois. Prix très résonable.   Ambiance moyenne du au décors un peu rétro et ce jour la une odeur de tabac froid."}
{"text":"We were looking for something off the beaten path for a celebratory dinner with my girlfriend and her parents when I came across this interesting sounding restaurant. I was a bit put off by the fact that it is cash or cheque only since I make a habit of carrying neither of these. After having visited the restaurant however I can definitively say it's worth making a stop at the ATM for. 

The interior is quite small, though it is tastefully decorated in a simple but elegant manner with dimmed lighting and music that altogether create a rather nice ambiance. The size however was not a problem since we had the place completely to ourselves which genuinely surprised me. The couple who own and operate the restaurant were very friendly and hospitable people who provided both great service (her) and great food (him).

Many of the dishes available were Asian themed, though the website I found Lubie on listed it as \"French, Middle-Eastern\" so perhaps they update their menu frequently. In any case the food was delicious. For appetizers we had a salad topped with thinly sliced potatoes and goat cheese that to me resembled baked brie, as well a trout chowder with very finely chopped vegetables that provided a wonderful texture. My main was a slightly sweet sauce that tasted similar to a mild raspberry vinaigrette drizzled over a melt-in-your-mouth pork tenderloin accompanied by Asian vegetables and a serving of rice. My girlfriend who grew up on the coast was rather impressed with her teriyaki glazed salmon with similar pairings to my dish. 

My only gripe with the entire experience would have to be the rather sparse selection of beer. I tried a local \"white\" beer which I found indistinguishable from most low-grade lagers available in any liquor store.

In summary whether you live in St-Jean or simply find yourself passing through, if you're looking for something other than your typical chain restaurants Lubie will fit the bill handsomely.

{"text":"An interesting blend of French cooking with Asian overtones made for a wonderful evening. Food was well presented, perfectly cooked and very reasonably priced. 

Our appetiser was a shrimp dim sum which was shared between provided a good lead in to our entrees. Chicken, duck and shrimp were all full of flavour, well cooked and artfully presented. Our desserts of tarte tatin, chocolate mousse and chocolate cake flavoured with five-spice and ginger were of a similar high quality. 

Our party of three were all in agreement that we should return to Restaurant Lubie to explore their menu further."}
{"text":"De \"retour\" à la maison pour une semaine, mes deux amis voulaient aller dans un bon restaurant pour fêter mon court retour.   Depuis que je vis a Vancouver, les restaurants de classe et à atmosphère chic y sont par centaine, à Saint-Jean, pas trop sur.  On connait mes gouts, j'aime la vrai bonne bouffe, et oui, je suis un peu \"fancy\".

Nous avions quelques choix, mais tous les restaurants j'y étais déjà aller, tous sauf un.  Lubie.  Placé au coin de la rue Saint-George et Richelieu, le restaurant fait face a une école de gymnastique.  Sur le rue Richelieu, j'y suis passé plusieurs fois dans ma vie mais jamais je n'ai remarquer le petit restaurant chaleureux qui y habite depuis plusieurs années, on m'as dis 12 ans.

C'était un mercredi soir, les lumières basses,  la noirceur de l'extérieur et les quelques clients créait un ambiance calme.  J'ai entendu dire que souvent l'ambiance y est plus de bistro que d'un endroit romantique.  Entrée d'escargots cuits à la perfection, je dirais qui \"fondent dans la bouche\" (??) jamais je n'ai eu d'escargot aussi bon.  Après les escargot, j'ai reçu mon plat de crevettes et mes amis reçurent leurs plat de poulet et melon d'eau.  Je ne me rappel pas du nom exact des plats mais je me rappel d'avoir échangé une crevette contre un bout de ce poulet panné, juteux, exquis, de l'avoir trempé dans la sauce aux saveurs de l'Inde, et d'ensuite échanger une seconde crevette contre encore, une bouché de poulet.  Mes crevettes étaient, oui, cuites à la perfection.  Les légumes, parfait.

De tous les restaurants que je suis allé dans ma vie, Lubie est un des plus beau, et l'un des meilleurs pour le goût et les saveurs.  Les prix sont très raisonnable pour la quantité mais surtout pour la qualité.  Ils y offre une carte acceptable de très bon vin et le service y est excellent.  Quoi demander de plus?  Ou le chef a-t-il appris a faire la cuisine?  Par lui même.  Je ne peux pas y croire!

Being \"back home\" for a week, my two good friends wanted to go to a nice restaurant to welcome me back.  Since i moved to Vancouver, classy and fancy restaurants are common, in Saint-Jean, not too sure.  They know my tastes, i like good good and yes, i am fancy.

We had a couple of choices, but all of them i've been to, all but one, Lubie.  At the corner of Saint-George and Richelieu street, the restaurant faces a gymnastic school.  Richelieu street, i've been many times in my life, but i've never seen this cozy little restaurant that lives there for many years, 12 i was told.

It was a wednesday night, low lights, outside darkness and the few customers were creating a calming ambiance.  I was told that often, the ambiance is more of a bistro than a romantic place.  We had the escargot starters, it was cooked to perfection, i would say they melted in our mouths (??) i never had tasty escargot like that.  After i received my shrimp plate and my friends received their crispy chicken and water melon.  I don't remember the names of the plates but i remember giving a shrimp for a piece of this breaded chicken, tasty, exquisite, to dip it in the Indian \"butter chicken\" kind of sauce, and to exchange a second shrimp for yet another piece of chicken and water melon.  My shrimps were cooked to yes, perfection and the vegetables were perfect.

Of all the restaurants i've been in my life, Lubie is one of the prettiest and one of the best for taste and flavors.  Prices are reasonable for the quantity but very much for the quality.  They have an acceptable selection of very good wine and the service is excellent.  What more can you ask for ?  Where did the chef learn how to cook?  Self taught.  I cannot believe it."}
