{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night on out W 130th pub crawl. It was 7:30 and the kitchen was closed. Only 3 people in the bar, with a bar tender that had less brains than clients.   Stopped in a few weeks ago and they were closed. Found out that was because the brainless bartender was late coming in.   Furthermore, found out the reason there is no food tonight is because they had a big party last night and were too lazy to open the kitchen today.   Two of the four taps were out. Instead of sports on the TVs, Tru TV was on showing some chick flick for the brainless bartender.   This place has so much potential, nice TVs, pool tables, couches. Just a dumb broad running the joint. Run, don't walk, from this dive."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this bar; I am just now learning that they have food so that is certainly something in the future to try. The bartender remembers me (Barb?) and I have only visited a few times. She is super friendly and the patrons seems to really like her. Some nights it is busy and others it is calm; either way great service and good times. The prices are fantastic and Barb will come up with some interesting drinks if you ask. Two times ago when I visited; I didn't have a exact taste for anything so she composed drinks of every color that were quite good. Overall; it is a great place that deserves a visit. Certainly want to try the burgers now."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night around 10pm. Was greeted by a completely dark bar with no music to be heard or bartender to be seen. Was told by a group of people that it was a great local favorite. The patrons of the bar were everything but welcoming. I found the bartender playing solitaire on her phone in a corner booth no where near the bar. This place had promise to be a diamond in the rough but has now become the inside joke of my friends group message. Shadows can stay in the shadows, hopefully never to be seen again, at-least by me."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out when they are having an event. Catch open mic nights on Tuesdays or come out on the weekends to see local bands and artists share their talents. \"Elvis\" is even a regular here lol. New cook new bartenders, this place is really stepping it's game up. Updated menu featuring classics such as burgers, quesadillas, wraps, and wings but with the cook's twist. Gotta try the omg burger (crispy onion straws, grilled shrooms and house made roasted garlic aioli) or the chicken chorizo basket. Don't skip the sweet corn fritters either! Great prices, awesome staff, so glad to see this place turning around."}
