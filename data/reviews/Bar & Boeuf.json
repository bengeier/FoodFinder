{"text":"Did not have a good experience there at all. Seemed good from the reviews, but food was bland and all the staff looked like they wanted to be somewhere else. Atmosphere cold as Ice. Much better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"Each dish was masterfully composed and extremely thought out. The dishes made sense, each component complimented and contrasted something else on the plate to feature a well rounded dish. Consciousness in menu design for a place of such calibre is few and far between. Higher ticket restaurants MAY have a tendency to rely on reputation and place their namesake before their product, however this is not the case here. I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try Bar & Boeuf's new menu of refined execution in meal, atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"Trendy spot with terrific food.  The Article char with spaetzel was delicious, and the clementine nib cake with the most fantastic apricot jelly was to die for. Friends had the steak and adored it, truffle butter made it taste even silkier.  Service was a tad slow, but friendly. It is fairly pricey, but honestly you get what you pay for. Definitely a place that caters to professionals in late 20s and up. Also had a gorgeous decor.  Overall, I really enjoyed it. Not an every day, or even every week, but it was an extremely enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"A very last minute trip brought me to Montreal and of course to my original disappointment I couldn't get a table at any of the places I had my heart set on; however the two of us foodies watched the disappointment disappear as we started our meal at Bar & Boeuf.  The Sommelier had a strong knowledge of the mainly European wine section and helped guide us to something that matched well with what we were ordering.  The king mushrooms and scallops both were average compared to the MUST try main course of the PIG CHUCK.  WOW is all I can say and no knife required for this great dish.  If you're a foodie it's worth checking out.  The atmosphere was solid; it wasn't so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation with someone next to you, but it had a vibe."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, try the menu degustation with the wine pairing, it is simply excellent! Sommelier Jean-Francois describes each wine in great detail, pairing them perfectly with the mouth-watering food."}
{"text":"I have often been frustrated with Montreal's lack of quality steak. Many  people rave about amazing steaks at this or that restaurant, but I'm not always convinced that they really know a good steak from a bad one. Or maybe they just don't eat steak very often, and consequently any steak is a good steak.  In any case, Bar & Boeuf is one of the few places that I, as a displaced Albertan and general fan of quality beef, can wholeheartedly endorse as having a really, really, REALLY good steak.   The cherry tomato salad is also rather delicious."}
{"text":"Bar and Boeuf is part of the McGill street explosion of eateries designed to cater to people in their 30's and up that sit outside of the hipster or scenester circle. That being said, you'll still see plenty of plaid shirts and some thick-rimmed glasses, but it's not the hipster hell of say, something like Lawrence.  Anyways, it's very cozy and quaint inside, although much larger than it looks from the outside. The tables give that reclaimed-driftwood look with wrought iron trim that's very in now, and the waitstaff are decked out in red plaid. Behind you on the walls are jars of homemade tomato sauce. The whole thing is very \"Greasy Spoon.\"   The food is actually excellent. The presentation is good, portions are sizeable, and everything is delicious. Try the grilled cheese if you're hungry, it's particularly filling.  Overall, more casual that anything, it's a great place for quality food in a chill atmosphere. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had a nice supper here with some out of town friends and their adorable and extremely well mannered kids. The waiter was very attentive and accommodate the little girl's request for a slight change in her dish. The food was impeccably plated, the presentation was on par and the food was delicious. The ambience was a little quiet as the music was a tad low but we had plenty of conversation to keep us entertained. All in all I recommend it as a solid eatery with excellent service and a wide variety of friendly dishes to please everybody's tastes."}
{"text":"I happened to be up in Montreal for my birthday and wanted something truly special to celebrate. When I was poking around on Yelp looking for a place I saw Bar & Boeuf and my favorite two little words: \"tasting menu\". Decision made.  Our very friendly and generally attentive waitress greeted us and hooked us up with menus and water. She didn't offer a cocktail and I didn't take the opportunity to just ask for one, which meant I did not have a manhattan on my birthday (sacrilege, I know!). It also meant it violated one of the best rules for life I've ever heard - every great meal should start with a great cocktail. That said, we glanced at the menu mostly because it was there, but we knew what wanted going in - bring on the tasting menu.  Unfortunately I can't remember each delicious dish we had, but I can say every one we had was an absolute hit - almost always triples and homers. The one thing that I did find odd about the overall experience was there were 7 courses but only 5 wine parings. While the dessert was just fine without it (a dish featuring an ice cream that defined the word creamy), the cheese course lacked a wine pairing and it was noticeably absent. The best dish by far was probably the appetizer, which was a \"deconstructed caprese\" for lack of a better way to describe it - a nice soft whipped buffalo milk with cherry tomatoes and basil - just outstanding.  The only small issue we had was as Anglophones in a predominately French speaking restaurant everyone kept trying to speak French to us before remembering that we only spoke English. I don't think this was an attempt to be snooty (snobby), more just they weren't expecting us. But the experience was still fantastic from start to finish, and it was a perfect way to spend a birthday."}
{"text":"Everything was really except the meat !!!! Our meat was tough extremely salty. We had a hard time cutting it with our knives!!!! It was cooked medium-rare as asked, but still very tough. I've been to this restaurant twice before and was not disappointed. This time, I'm reconsidering going back......"}
{"text":"Hitting the spot after Poutine the night before, B&B was very good.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food - oysters and beef medium-rare with truffle-butter.  Service was a bit slow, but I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't bother me.  Normally I would give a place like this 4 stars, but I'm offsetting the vegetarian who went to a restaurant called Bar & Boeuf and complained about the menu.  Great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Coming off our prior evening at L'Orignal, my friend and I wanted a dining experience that would be close to that standard.  The concierge recommended Bar & Beouf.  The restaurant, we were told by the hostess, was not typically open on a Sunday, but they were this evening with a 5 course prix frie menu for $45 (I think--I hope I'm not misremembering things).  The first part of the dinner was an amuse-bouche of salmon tartare (I think) on piece of baguette.  Very tasty, but not the highlight of the meal (then again, it isn't supposed to be!).  The next course offered a choice of salad or a cold pea soup. My friend got the soup and enjoyed it; I had the salad and enjoyed the perfectly ripe tomatoes.  Tasty, but nothing to write home about.  The next course were small tomatoes with this amazing (AMAZING!) mozarella cheese foam.  It was a delightful take on a caprese salad.  The cheese foam (seriously--that couldn't have been a block of cheese) was so light and the tastes were brought out in a way that the cheese alone wouldn't have done.  Our main entree was either a beef pot roast (sorry, I don't speak or read French, so this is the closest I am getting) that my friend ordered.  I tried it--it was delicious.  Perfectly tender and melted away in your mouth.  I had the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was a large piece of brownie with whipped cream and some ice cream on top.  I was so stuffed I couldn't finish the dessert, and wished I could pack it away for later that evening.  Bar & Boeuf was a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere is a tad cold, but that wasn't helped since the place wasn't that busy (again, they said they weren't usually open on a Sunday, but they had a large group eating in the one section of the restaurant).  The wait staff was very attentive to our table.  The tomato and cheese salad dish bumped this up to 4-stars for me.  I want to go back when their normal menu is in use."}
{"text":"Bar & Boeuf is an amazing spot.  I went for my birthday and was not dissapointed.  The service was a little laissez faire for our taste, but the tasting menu was amazing.  The steak had a great quality to it and the heirloom tomato salad was very tasty.  If I'm ever in the area again or know people who are going, this is a place that I would definitely recommend.  The ambiance is excellent as well.  It's very swank."}
{"text":"Sans être transcendant, j' ai trouver l'endroit très sympa. Premièrement l'entrée: j'ai pris la courge qui en fait est un Carpaccio de courge déposé sur un morceau de foie gras poêlé avec des quenelles d'abricot en purée, pas mal bon mais manquait un peu d'assaisonnement. Le tartare de mon comparse se défendait bien lui aussi. Pour ce qui est du plat principal, nous avons tout les 2 pris la pièce de buf qui était tout simplement délicieuse. Les frites et salade qui l'accompagnait  ne gâchaient rien du tout. Finalement le dessert était relativement quelconque. Cependant, comme dirait mes amis serbo-croate, i'm a sucker for service, et il était hors pair et c'est ce qui fait leur donner 4 étoiles au lieu de 3! J' y retournerais sûrement mais au 6 mois,pour leur laisser le temps de changer le menu."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I view TasteMTL/MTLaTable as a great opportunity for new and existing restaurants to wow us with their culinary prowess.  That being said, mediocre just doesn't cut it for me.   Location: On McGill in the Old Port, a few minutes walk from Square Victoria. Easily accessible.   Vibe: Personally, I loved B&B's space, With its high ceilings and elegant decor, the space felt open and not at all confined. The purple lighting accents totally worked.   Service: Just OK. I felt that the wait staff could have been more attentive, particularly since the restaurant only had a few patrons. I didn't like where our table was located - right in front of the kitchen entrance. There were constant comings and goings that I found annoying as all hell. That, and they easily could have given us another table - the restaurant was emoty when we arrived and empty when we left SO.....   Food: I specifically went for Taste MTL, so stuck with that particular menu (see my pic for full menu details). What I had:   Squash soup with smoked trout: This was a total miss for me. While I liked the texture and consistency of the soup (super creamy), it tasted like, well, nothing. I did not taste the squash, which is essentially what I was looking forward to, and I could smell the smoked trout way more than I could taste it. Served lukewarm on a very cold evening. Um, what?  I also tried the mussels - ugh! To me, it tasted like the bottom of the ocean. Fishy and just, ugh!  Chicken with parsnips and mashed potatoes: The chicken had a nice flavor, but it was a little on the dry side. There was definitely not enough broth on this dish. The parsnips were tasty but a little undercooked for my taste. The mashed potatoes? Well, for me they were the best part of the meal. Loved them. The minimal broth or sauce in the dish had a nice flavor - too bad there wasn't more of it.  My friend ordered the salmon and the first thing I thought when I saw that dish was 'It's so brown.' Yep.  Lemon tart: I had high hopes for dessert but this didn't really work for me. This was more of a lemon mousse than anything else. It was extremely tart yet very sweet at the same time. The graham crust while thin, had a very pronounced flavor that really just didn't work with the lemon, in my opinion.   Overall, this place was a miss for me. It just felt like they didn't go to any trouble to develop a menu for the week. My table concluded that these dishes represented a total lack of effort on Bar & Boeuf's part. A very underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"La recommandation du serveur: échine de cochon braisée  Je dois dire que, j'ai été très déçu, très sec, peu de saveur et trop cuit ...  Bref, je ne suis peut-être pas chanceux, mais pour 155$ pour deux personnes avec vin, j'ai définitivement mangé mieux ailleurs."}
{"text":"WOW!  This is why Yelp* exists!  Was sitting in my hotel room in Montreal thinking about where to enjoy a Saturday night dinner out on the town and came across Bar & Boeuf on Yelp and made a reservation via Open Table.  Great location and from the moment I walked in the door until I left in a nirvanic haze some three and a half hours later, I was treated like a king!  A very strong wine list coupled with an innovative menu and gorgeous plating made for an unforgettable dining experience.  Listening to other diners around me I feel pretty comfortable in saying that everyone was enjoying their meals as much as I did!  I can without hesitation recommend the Heirloom Tomato/Buffala Mozzarella appetizer and the (now famous) Pig Chuck.    Take a spin on their very informative (and bilingual!) website and look forward to a great evening."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal earlier this afternoon, exhausted after a 6 hour drive from Buffalo and really just wanting a good, non-fast-food meal before crashing for the night. After walking around the neighborhood and not finding very many options open tonight (it's Tuesday night), we hopped in to Bar & Boeuf because it looked like a much better option than the diner across the street. :)   We were greeted warmly and seated quickly; I'm definitely thankful for the availability of a coat check. Also, decent wine selection; I really enjoyed a glass of pinot noir that I'm kicking myself for not writing down the name of.   I started with the green salad; the greens were fresh, crispy, and perfectly dressed. Nothing really special, but after a day of driving and eating horrible fast food, I attacked that salad like a ravenous wolf. Vegetation = yum. My husband and I also split the heirloom tomato salad, and we were surprised at how sweet and juicy the tomatoes were given the fact that it's the middle of February! The Bufala Mozzarella had a whipped, almost foamy texture -- it was the perfect, light start to the meal.   My husband ordered the Black Angus Beef, which was good but tasted as if it might have spent a little too much time marinating; the taste of the marinade overpowered the beef somewhat. However, the accompanying fries were fresh and crispy, and the seasoning on the fries complemented the beef well.   The thing I really want to write about, though, is the braised pig chuck. The server told me it was their specialty, and they definitely deliver on that. OMG. The pork was super tender, topped with a really nice burgundy mushroom sauce and a perfectly poached egg. The dish was so very homey -- exactly the comfort food I was needing. It was served atop mashed potatoes that were mixed with cheese curds. It was so good, I have to say it twice: MASHED POTATOES MIXED WITH CHEESE CURDS. Seriously yum.  I'm ready to crash asleep right now, but that pork was so good I had to Yelp it right away. If you find yourself at Bar & Boeuf, definitely make it a point to order the pig chuck -- it's a must."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst restaurant I have been to in Montreal. From the service to the wait time to the food; just an awful experience. We waited over an hour for our appetizers...what fancy, complicated appetizers did our table of 3 order you ask? Oysters. Yup. Oysters. When the oysters finally arrived, they were warm. As in, warmer than room temperature. I ordered the salmon tartare which could have been salmon...or beef...or tofu. It was impossible to tell from the disgusting amount of packaged, dry dill that was mixed in with it. Just inedible! By the time our mains arrived 1.5 hours into the service, we were famished. My croque monsieur sandwich and fries came out stone cold. When I picked the sandwich up and flipped it over, it was absolutely charcoal black...burnt beyond any measure of being consumable. I was FURIOUS! My bf ordered the same dish and his was also burnt beyond recognition. Now, I'm not talking about a little dark for my liking. I'm talking about absolutely burnt black, should have NEVER been put in front of someone to eat. The manager had no explanation and was horrified by our plates. Well I'm Sorry just doesn't cut it. Who is in the kitchen sending out food that should be in the trash? I was so embarrassed to have taken my colleague there for a business meeting. HORRIBLE experience. Avoid this train-wreck of a restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"UPDATE ON FOOD POISONING RESOLUTION:  I  feel bad for this place for being owned and managed by people who lack compassion and the simple principles of customer service. Management needs a HUGE makeover. From the owner to manager they do not belong in this industry because they simply don't know the first thing about dealing with customers when things don't go their way.   The owner called me about 2 weeks after the incident and from the get go I could tell he had no intention of resolving a thing. Instead he began by telling me how annoyed and bothered he was that my food poisoning incident happened during his vacation. Wow. Well, guess he didn't know that I was also on vacation when I got food poisoning from an oyster I ate at his restaurant (documented by the hospital btw). It was also on New Year's Eve, having to take an ambulance that cost us $900, and spending 6+hours in the ER. I'm sorry for the inconvenience- should I have waited until you were done vacationing to let you know about this?  If you don't want to bothered by real issues that happen when you own a restaurant (or any business for that matter) then you shouldn't own a business. Deal with it. And if you don't want to or don't know how to deal with issues like this, then put someone who can. Bad things happen and whether you're on vacation or not, you must handle it in a timely manner and in an appropriate way. Not by calling and yelling at the customer for writing reviews of her experience at your restaurant on TripAdvisor, Yelp, Twitter while you were on vacation...  My previous review of this place still stands, with zero attempt at a resolution. I guess even an apology or a bit of compassion was too much to ask for after your food put me in the hospital while I was on vacation. And it has me thinking that your restaurant must be doing quite horribly that by comping us a couple of drinks or refunding us $300 for a dinner we were unable to enjoy because we got food poisoning from your food, would've broke your bank account. Sad that this place is run by these people because it's a nice place but the service my husband and I received left the worst taste in our mouths. Best of luck..."}
{"text":"When in Montreal there are so many choices between Find Dining, Street Food, Latin Quarter and of course Poutine. Through the streets filled with old buildings overflowing with character of Old Montreal it's hard not to fall in love with such an amazing city. But how one falls in love cannot be merely measured with buildings, it is the smell and taste of its food that embeds memories... provides an emotional comfort zone.  We arrived at this city feeling somewhat like an idiot we decided to dine at Au Pied du Cochon featured on Anthony Bourdain's Quebec episode of No Reservation. How could we be so careless not to have RSVP-ed. How could we be so careless to leave our stomachs empty of calories and fat from duck, poutine au foie gras, due de foie gras and Pied de cochon, or PDC farci au foie gras?   Such oversight left us wandering the streets of Rue McGill hand in hand until we arrived at Bar & Boeuf. The name repeated itself as we passed by. I suddenly remember that a colleague recommended this place during our conference.    Bar & Boeuf is a trendy, upscale restaurant at the heart of the financial district. Two floors of casual elegence and chic environment. We shared a table downstairs and began studying the menu. Menu's are seasonal and changes from time to time. Be sure to update yourself at their website.    BEEF TARTARE 14 Grilled croutons, niçoise and served with an oyster? Wow. I've seen quail eggs but never before oysters. This is nice and of course even better when paired with wasabi pea puree -  fancy and quite light.   EUROPEAN BASS 26 Cauliflower puree with a perfectly seared fish. This was a safe dish. I'm not sure why we didn't order the Veal since it is served with foie gras sauce. This would've been a nice replacement to Au Pied du Cochon... actually scratch that. How could it replace it?  SUCKLING PIG 23 Slices of cochon with iced parsnips, sweet potatoes, and tunips. Suckling and juicy.   We came here early before the crowds gathered and departed to roam Vieux-Montréal for a romantic stroll towards Notre Dame down Rue Saint Paul O."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful.  We had appetizers all the way down to dessert. Presentations were all beautiful. Portions were a bit petit. Dinner for 2 with a 1/2 bottle of wine came to $210. Wait staff needs to be a little more attentive and caring. Chef came out to greet one table, then disappeared. I would have liked to say hello- wasn't very busy at the time."}
{"text":"Awesome! We ate there while on vacation and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried the heirloom tomato salad, lobster, beef tartar, and cheese plate... everything was good (although i wasn't a big fan of the cheese foam with the tomatoes)."}
{"text":"Food: Chose the 7 course tasting menu, try it for yourself, a must visit when in Montreal. (Scale 1-10 rating)  1) Cherry tomato salad with Chessy foam emulsion, my fiance's favorite dish, its fresh and clean, (9.5)  2) Smoked duck (smells like bacon MMmmmm) with duck confeit croquette. (9.5)  3) Froie Gras scallops with peas and ham, its partitioned by a toasted sweetened piece of bread, textures are really great, both cooked perfectly (9)  4) Arctic Char ... nothing memeroable, cooked well, flavor... forgetable. (7), nothing against the dish itself, it may be the fish, I don't know, I am not a \"fish guy\"  5) Black Angus steak, this was awesome it was accompanied with a parsnip puree potatoe and some veggies, (10)  --- I started having a food coma---- so just #'s from this momment on 6) Warm brie shaped in a circular mold with white toast - (8)  7) Lychee sorbet (8)  Service: Spot on, very attentive, even admitted that the bartender forgot to add simple syrup in my fiance's mojito.  Decor: Contemporary, Sheek, feels like a lounge, high ceilings, very comfy coushioned seats.  Price: Very reasonable for their 7 course tasting menu. 65$ I have never paid this little...   Convience: Location is easy to get to, its 4 minutes walk from Le Westin in downtown. Opentable.com reservation made things go smoothly."}
{"text":"Bouffe - Leur menu midi est excellent. Menu concis, exécution « spot-on », et d'une qualité exceptionnelle.   Service - À la hauteur de ce qu'on attend d'un resto high class. Très professionnel.   Ambiance - décor très chic et moderne. Très agréable comme expérience du midi."}
{"text":"Ended up here for dinner because I was an idiot and didn't call for reservations early enough for Au Pied du Cochon and then decided to give this place a shot in place of it. What a great choice it turned out to be.  So I figured what the hell and went for the 7 course meal with wine pairings. It was beyond awesome although the sitting ended up taking almost 4 hours which had to be the longest dinner I've ever had.  The selections were all pretty good but my favorites were the duck foie gras, country bread and the beef. All the wine pairings were very good and the explanations from the waiter and sommelier were helpful and interesting.  So if your looking for a food orgy followed by a long food coma while amazingly not feeling stuffed go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Essayé pour un lunch d'affaires. Très bien exécuté, présenté, mon onglet de veau était vraiment bien, le menu est bien équilibré et à prix raisonnable, du moins pour le lunch. À ce que j'ai pu voir la carte des vins est assez complète avec beaucoup de sélections entre 30$ et 60$. Je reviendrai, peut-être même le soir."}
