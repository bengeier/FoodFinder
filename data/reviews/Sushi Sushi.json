{"text":"Probably the worst sushi I've ever had. Charges extra for spicy sushi yet nothing is remotely close to spicy. Miso soup is cold. The sushi tastes so bland and warm. I would NEVER recommend eating here. On top of that the lady named Ribby is the most rude and miserable person ever."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. 1st time wasn't impressed,and though maybe they were having an off day. Decided to give them a 2nd chance..and disappointed again! Rolls contain way too much rice and aren't \"tight\". They fall apart when picked up. We ordered the lunch specials.. cali rolls and salmon + avocado and shrimp tempura rolls... they put salad in their tempura rolls (gross!). Their chicken teriyaki was just as bad. Looks like they boiled then browned the chicken and just topped it with the teriyaki sauce. Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"I used to have so many great things to say about this joint, but now I typically avoid it. While there's nothing particularly wrong with it, there isn't anything great either.
If I have access to a car, I'm definitely going to another sushi place. The only selling point for me is that I can walk to Sushi Sushi. Decent food. Decent service. Decent. That's the word that suns this place up."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to go to for lunch since I work in the area, but I don't see myself come here with friends or on a date. The sushi quality is alright - nothing over the top but not horrible either. Service is decent too. Serving portions are small but they're still fine.
I would recommend this for a sushi quick fix."}
{"text":"Hated this place.  Food was ok but did not like ordering off a checklist instead of perusing normal buffet tables.  Waitress kinda argued with me when I told her I only got 4 pieces of sushi when there was supposed to be 6 on the plate.  Red wine was very warm.  Nowhere near enough wasabi and radish was initially provided.  This place sucked in my opinion especially at 22.95 per person."}
{"text":"Been here twice and not going back again. Although they are cheaper than the other ayce in the area the quality of the sashimi is subpar and not very fresh. Spend a few more bucks for better stuff its worth it."}
{"text":"In a city teeming with AYCE options, this joint definitely does not stand out. It had mixed reviews in nearly every website. Honestly, the sushi wasn't that great. It was average, bordering below average. 

If you really want to try this place, try it at lunch time, since it's cheaper. I wouldn't dish out $25 for dinner."}
{"text":"I've always come here with the family since the food is quite good and the variety is excellent. Service is a little slow, and the staff often misunderstood extra requests (i.e. no avocado/cucumber in the rolls), etc. Atmosphere is great - nice d√©cor, seating area is aplenty, and it does get busy quite a lot. Sushi was decent, not mindblowing good, but if you're craving some sushi, it won't disappoint. 

Price is quite reasonable for the portions that you're getting. Bento meals are great value dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi and teppanyaki. We passed by this restaurant a few times before giving it a try. Dined in the first time and we were delighted with the friendly service. We ordered sushi and sashimi combo which comes with miso soup and an order of tempura and it was really good. Since our first visit in December we have ordered take out several times since. Their 10 pc sushi set and #28 party tray is great value for the money. It is a cute little restaurant and I really hope they do well. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. 
Had all you can eat sushi. 
Food was ok, but not my favourite sushi. 
Washrooms were clean, but very dark."}
{"text":"First time here, very disappointed with the sushi, it's no better than mall sushi. Never will come here again, nothing else to say.. Save yourself the time and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Sushi Sushi!! Fresh delicious all you can eat sushi goodness!! One of my Favorite spots in Mississauga. Love the Dragon Rolls,  Sashimi and the Tempura Shrimp is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible.  Salmon and tuna sushi smelt really bad. It seems like they made it a few days ago. There was no taste at all especially when you order spicy salmon and tuna. Horrible staff, dirty restaurant and not worth the price. I would not recommended this restaurant to anyone. Please do not order from here. Gals sushi on warden and hwy 7 is 100 times better. 

If you eat here you will definitely be SICK!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to for AYCE sushi. Selection and quality are very solid for AYCE. On very few occasions have any food orders gotten lost, and staff are always pleasant.

I should also mention that my friends and I are big eaters. It is not uncommon for me to eat two entrees at a typical restaurant.

I also judge a lot about a restaurant by the state of their washrooms, and Sushi Sushi's are well kept. The worst I've seen is someone threw paper towel in the sink, so it wasn't draining properly. I reported it to a staff member on my way back to my table, and in quick order someone was on their way to handle it."}
{"text":"Came back here for lunch after a few years...since they opened actually. Sorry to say, the place isn't maintained at all. Their menu says new items...but they were new in 2013. Their surfaces are dark and oily. Cups are in bad shape too. Someone returned their drink because it was leaking - it had a pretty large noticeable crack going through it. 
The food was good. Better than most AYCE. Service was nice.
I might visit again - in a few years..."}

They just continued cleaning up. 15 minutes later they decided to entertain us to let us know that we can order up until 950. Really??? I hope the owner knows he loses customers because his staff stop their service an hour before close"}

This restaurant says Teppanyaki but it's misleading. Yes you will get teppanyaki food but there's only one grill and no you don't sit in front of the grill, so it's just a kitchen grill moved to the store front (not enough room at the back perhaps) for show only."}
{"text":"I go there for lunch sometimes and it's pretty good.  There are some better locations in Mississauga in my opinion but given the direction I'm headed this is the best option. Sometimes a at lunch it can be packed but if you arrive early to be okay"}
{"text":"this place is alright, definitely not better than 168 that's for sure ! 
the service was 3/5 , the waitress wasn't mean but she wasn't nice
I did not like how hard it was to catch a staff members attention we had to all raise our hands and say excuse me ? a couple of times to get help.

the place was clean, I did not go in to the washrooms but my friends went and they reported it to be clean so that's good to me.

the food is 4/5 I just don't like when the sushi chef puts way to much rice in everything, I know they're trying to fill us up on rice instead of fish. DONT DO THAT !! lol I like my salmon !!! 

I would come here again but if I had to choose between 168 it would be 168 hands down !"}
{"text":"By far the worst AYCE in Mississauga area.
First of all the staff is rude and inattentive. Secondly they only bring half the order and come back to make the excuse that they lost the order sheet. 

Ordered:
Crab wontons -- sweet like dessert 
All the rolls had frozen shrimp tempura

Fish on dynamite was sour. The fried banana was soggy and dripping from oil.

Overall - horrible food that's extremely overpriced. I wouldn't ever go again even if it was free. 

$22.99 + taxes (weekday dinner)"}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten take out from here so not much to say about the service.
I usually order the yam tempura roll, avocado roll, and edamame. The rolls are good and consistent. My only issue is with the edamame. It's sometimes just right, sometimes overcooked and sometimes under. It's not the greatest. But it's ok for a quick, reasonably priced meal. Sometimes though, for such a small order the wait time to pick up is over 25 mins and when you get there, the restaurant is not even busy!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best AYCE sushi place in the GTA. We go here on a weekly basis and we are never dissapointed!"}
{"text":"First and last time customer. They quality of the food was poor and it's evident that the restaurant is trying to maximize their profit by cheaping out on better ingredients. Ie. putting lettuce in their shrimp tempura rolls? 

I was also not impressed when I asked for extra ginger and wasabi...the staff scolded me for not telling them before hand because she had to open my bag and place it inside (I got take out), and then insisted that I was had to be charged extra? 

I hope the extra dollar that they charged me was worth it for not ever having me come back here again!"}
{"text":"Have had take-out from Sushi Sushi twice now. It is supremely mediocre. I distrust anywhere that passes off neon pink fish as tuna. It is fast food style, and too expensive for what you get. Unfortunately they lucked out on location, as there are little options nearby. You will get fed and all, but don't expect much."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The value and portions here made this place stand out for me.  We had the sashimi lunch and another lunch special with a spider roll and california roll.  I was shocked at the size of the sashimi.  It is about twice the size of what is normally served at your average sushi restaurant.  Served with miso soup, the sashimi was fresh and everything was well prepared.  So, 2 lunch specials and a pop and green tea cost $19 and change.  How great is that???  I avoided this place before because I thought it was a fast food place you'd find in a food court but was pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered some delivery for lunch last weekend. It was a good meal! 

I ordered a bento box that came with some sushi and sashimi and I also ordered some tempura.

The price and portion we're fine - about the same as most other Japanese places in Mississauga.

The food itself tasted great. I especially liked the tempura and the rice.

No complaints. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to make this place a weekly thing. Great food and attentive-enough service (for an ayce anyway). The staff can speak better English than most restos of this type too. The enoki beef rolls are excellent. Pretty good fish and the requisite green tea ice cream at the end make for a decent meal at a decent price (especially if you pay cash).

Hint to the staff: when a diner finds a staple in her salmon sashimi (by biting down and having it catch in the roof of her mouth), the correct action is to apologize at the very least. The incorrect action, performed for us, is to say \"oh yeah they use staples back there for the order slips, sometimes it gets in the food\".  No apology, no compensation, barely even a second glance.

It'll be a long while till we build up the courage to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!

I have tried my fair share of sushi.
NOTHING beats this place!

I have even tried random joints as recommended by friends and family since they know we are very big on good sushi. But we always seem to come back.
We have yet to find a place that can top this one!

Menu is huge!
All you can eat option is wonderful!
Everything is FRESH!
The place is done really nicely! Chandeliers, wall paint etc.

Love the little card option, write down what you want, and they bring it.
Ive been to a few places that still take down your order manually (and then of course screw up cuz of how much you are ordering).

Items I recommend:
- hot and sour soup
- miso soup
- mango salad
- mango sushi
- green dragon roll
- sushi sushi house roll
- shrimp and yam tempura
- salmon rolled asparagus
- chicken teriyaki
- chicken skewer
- beef ribs

clearly....lots of good options to choose from!

I will go back over and over.
make sure you have a designated driver when you leave, because you will STUFF YOURSELF and just want to sleep once you are done!
DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"It's been a bit downhill for this location but still decent I guess. The problem is at $40/person there are way better options.

Customer service is what you'd expect at a place like this. Location is could do with maintenance."}
{"text":"Its all about AYCE baby! I have been here multiple times with coworkers and I would have to say not the best but a huge menu. 

The service is fast and sushi is average but fresh. The place it self is quite big and their is enough seating available. I didn't mind it much as I was paying the lunch price and not $25 for dinner. 

Over all not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Sushi Sushi came recommended from the staff at the hotel I was staying at. I was craving some sushi and this establishment did not disappoint. It was a Monday evening so I did not expect it to be too busy and it wasn't. Maybe about half full. I was greeted promptly as soon as I walked in and seated a few seconds later. The staff are friendly but do not make chit chat with you. I think language might be a barrier there. Either way the service was slow to start but once the food started coming it was a steady stream. For a AYCE sushi place, they gave you plenty of time to finish your first round before bringing the next so your table wasn't completely covered with dishes. A definite plus in my books is that when the wait staff brought the dishes to your table, they would announce what it was before they left. I don't know about you but at most of these sushi places I forget what I ordered as soon as the menu leaves the table. So it was nice to be reminded of what I had ordered. Presentation of the food was pleasant and appealing. 

The food was fresh and clearly being made as I ordered. It smelt good and tasted equally. The variety was very nice and plentiful. I discovered. A little delight I had never seen before at any other sushi restaurant and that was crabmeat cheese wontons. These little deep fried treats are filled with a little piece of cream cheese and crabmeat nicely melted together in the crispy wonton wrapper. Highly recommended. 

The atmosphere in the building was a tad dark and noisy. Even thought they were only half full, I found the noise level annoyingly loud. Maybe it was just from the table of people that only were able to talk at one volume which was like they were in a drunken pub watch the hockey game but certainly detracted from my experience. It would of been nice to have a bit more light to eat by also. A small annoyance is that they don't take Amex. But on the other hand their is a 10% discount for dinner if you pay by cash. 

Overall I was very happy with my meal her and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"$50 take out party tray .... and I get a foam board of 1/3 sashimi (which is ok quality... I spat out like 25% of it) .. another 1/3 of cucumber, salmon, white tuna sushi rolls .... and the last 1/3 of sushi pieces .. thats quality of mac sushi if not crappier. For $50 ...... Its not worth it. Not coming back. Owned by Chinese (Cantonese) people. No discount for take out or cash. But they do take credit card.."}
{"text":"Not top notch for AYCE.  But it satisfies the sushi craving we all get.  Slow service, small servings.... But it does the trick.  It was okay... But I have been more than once - so I guess it couldn't have been that bad!  Great if you lower your expectations and just fill the need for Japanese!"}
{"text":"I had AYCE lunch here on a Thursday at 12pm-ish. Overall the sushi is okay but the side dishes were not. Probably the worst out of around 7 AYCE sushi places I have been to. And not cheap either; $15/person.

Service was average, except that we waited at the front desk for around 3 - 5 minutes waiting for someone to seat us. I did like that instead of asking the waitresses/waiters for an order list every time there was a notepad of them on each table. Food came out pretty fast.

The sushi was okay. Not horrible, not fantastic. The fish in the salmon sushi wasn't the freshest I've had and was a bit mushy. The rolls were proportioned so that it was around 70% cucumber/avocado/vegetables and 30% meat/fish, which means that I tasted mostly vegetables. I had 2 cups of water, the first of which had small white tissue like bits floating in it and the second just tasted weird. I also had a sip of the tea, which wasn't bad but was kind of bland.

The other dishes (I had yam tempura, pad thai, fried rice, Mongolian beef, grilled squid, etc) were mostly bland and the serving size was way too big. The grilled squid/Mongolian beef/pad thai in particular had such big serving sizes that after eating it, I wouldn't be able to eat much else. I liked the Mango salad and chicken skewers. Chicken 

I definitely will not be returning here. I saw this on inSauga's list of best 5 Mississauga sushi places and that's why I came. Well, this place has earned a top 5 place, but on my sushi restaurant blacklist. I don't really care about service or d√©cor as long as food is good and cheap but the reason why I don't like this place is that the food is honestly bad. Some were passable but others were so bland that I straight up didn't even want to finish my plate."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

Sushi was average at best. I had the chicken teriyaki while my wife had the Shrimp teriyaki entrees. They were also average in my opinion. Prices were on the low side so that provides some balance. Service was good but we were the only ones in the place on a Wednesday evening - not a good sign I guess. Would not go out of my way for a second visit."}
{"text":"Good for takeout. All You Can Eat in the restaurant is tedious.

For Example; When ordering seaweed salad in the restaurant, it comes on a tiny dish holding three bites worth. My request for a larger amount on a bigger dish was not registered by the server. I tried ordering two seaweed salads at a time for a larger serving, and 2 tiny dishes arrived. When ordering seaweed salad for takeout, it is a generous full cup.

The sushi is fine. The Benito meals are a good value with plenty of food. The driver is a kind and timely gentleman. When eating in the restaurant I find service to be inconsistent, and many dishes do not show up. 

It is adequate for the location."}
{"text":"ive been here so many times and have always left happy. fast, clean and good quality food. The service is super nice !! would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Half of the things ordered were never brought to the table. Will not be coming back here again. Food is hit or miss, sometimes it's decent sometimes it seems stale. This place lacks customer service and consistency."}
{"text":"I dont mind Sushi Sushi, It's close to home, AYCE, and they've got a decent selection for both the kids and myself. I've been here a handful of times, and its mostly  because its close to home, and can get the family full whilst being within budget (we usually pay around $70 after tax for the 4 of us) If you pay cash you can get 10% off. Im a sashimi over sushi girl, and Im quite happy with their sashimi - they are not too thick/thin, a decent amount of fresh, and not frozen like some of the other sushi joints Ive tried. My sons not a sushi fan so it works great for me because they've got a great selection of cooked foods, such as pinapple fried rice, fried noodles, etc. Service was great when they first opened, not so much anymore as they have gotten quite busy in the last year. If It weren't for convenience of the family, I would much rather dine somewhere else. Don't bother asking for the bill because you have to pay on your way out the door. Overall, I dont mind coming here when we need our sushi fix.  The hype is over now, and they really need to up on their service."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch. Attentive service and creative menu options compared to the standard sushi offerings.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to have some sushi.  Mississauga is wanting for non-AYCE sushi joints, so I went onto Yelp and caved to another AYCE sushi place.

This place was quite noisy, but that was probably due to the customers as opposed to the servers themselves and also, they were quite busy.  The decor was fairly modern as well.  It seemed like it tried to copy Spring Rolls a bit.  

As for the food, we ordered salmon, tuna, mackerel, and snapper sashimi.  While the fish was fairly fresh, it was too cold.  I understand you want to keep the fish fresh, but sashimi shouldn't taste like it's taken out of a fridge.  The eel sushi was okay, but didn't have enough of a BBQ taste.  

We also ordered a bunch of rolls and the best one was the Las Vegas roll.  It was crunchy and hand mango, tuna, crab meat, fish roe and some tempura bits I think. I liked it. 

So overall, food I would give it 3.5/5, but overall ambiance was lacking (due to the noise), so docking it down to 3."}
{"text":"Just about as average (if not a little worse) as you can get from a typical AYCE Sushi restaurant.

I decided to go to this place because inSauga rated it one of the top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants in Mississauga.  Having tried the other 4 (Heart, 168, Famous formly known as Yangs and Prince), i decided to give it shot....

My first red flag should have been that they placed Famous sushi in their list. 

Went here a while back with my girlfriend on our day off during lunch.  Suprisingly enough the place was not completely empty as I would expect it to be on a weekday lunch.  We were promptly seated and given our drinks. Our first tea cup was cracked down the middle and was leaking... so that immediately lowered my quality expectations.  One of the waitresses apologized and gave us a new cup along with a pot of tea - which seems to be the norm for the restaurant; the 7-8 other tables also had teapots on their tables too.  

We ordered our food via pen and paper, and sent it off.  Food came in waves and came quickly (thats good right?).  My girlfriend said the salmon sushi tasted off to her, but I didn't really notice anything wrong so I happily ate her share.  

One of the ongoing problems with ayce sushi restaurants are the sushi rolls.  Many places will provide a rather bland selection of items, and then add too much cucumber/avocado/crisp to it to offset the meat and therefore increase profits.  This place seemed to uphold this unspoken policy and really dampened the taste.

We didn't have too many kitchen items, so I can't speak too much of it, but from what we got I would rate them average.  

We ordered a spicy salmon pizza on the first round and only received it before paying the bill.  This was after asking the server a few times for it, and they explained how the rice had to be deep fried for the pizza.  As a prior worker at 168 sushi (yes I'm referring to this again)  I understood this, and knew that it would take about 8 minutes for it to come out.  We gave them said amount of time, and never received it. After about 15 we got it, but we were rather full at that point so we ate it we heavy hearts (and stomachs).

Their dessert selection is nice though, I will admit.  If i remember correctly they had a larger selection of items than the usual 4 flavoured-ice cream assortment, and banana tempura.  Though....the mousse cake tasted stale. I'm going to attribute this one to going during weekday lunch.

Overall this place was not the best place to go, but seeing how it's so far from downtown Mississauga, this may be one of your only places to go if you're craving a lot of sushi.

If not you can always check inSauga's list of top AYCE Sushi restaurants...HA"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, i would've given them a solid 4 stars. Not now, no way! I was a regular since they opened their doors. The days where they served great quality steaks for the steak terriyaki and made really great sushi. The quality has really gone down. Way too much rice in their rolls & sushi and not enough fish. I ordered maki rolls last week and the salmon wasn't even in the roll - there were tiny pieces placed on top of some of the rolls. Not impressed by that and it's happened more than once. As far as I know there are 2 brothers that own this restaurant. One of them is great at making sushi while the other is a bit cheap with portions and doesn't make the rolls right with a lot of rice and hardly any fish (super thin & small pieces). Markham really needs a good Sushi/Japanese restaurant, quality & portions have gone down a lot at most of the well /better known places. What they charge for their sushi & terriyaki is an insult to customers. Too expensive and they don't even offer any great options for sushi or rolls - nothing fancy yet so expensive! I can find better sushi nearby at The Garden Basket & Longos."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! 4.5 stars in my books!

I love that the service staff is so friendly! And that they speak English! And that they (at least act like) care about the customers! Novel concept! Ya' know what else I love? That they bring an insulated carafe of hot tea and leave it on your table!

I've only been in for lunch a couple of times so far but they have a HUGE menu! It could possibly be the largest I've seen for an AYCE place. I think it's great that the menu lists how large the portions are. And most are very small so if you want to sample lots of different items you don't have to stuff yourself silly. Also great for solo diners. If you really like something you can of course order a larger amount. The only thing I'd like to see larger are the cuts of fish on the nigiri. Otherwise I think the sizes are super.

If I were to judge just the sushi bar items I would have to knock off a star. Don't get me wrong, they are ok. But just ok. Nothing special. I'm very satisfied with the kitchen items that I've tried though. It's also worth mentioning that they have a large selection of vegetarian items that are noted as such on the menu including veggie gyoza! Yuuummmmy! 

Overall I am a total fan of this place and already becoming a regular customer. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Sushi Sushi had super fresh sushi and amazing quality chicken teriyaki half n hour before closing. The Shrimp Tempura was pure quality and I actually like vegetable tempura for once. Would recommend 10/10. Wish they had more special rolls on the menu though (mango roll)."}

{"text":"Excellent service, extremely polite and friendly staff it is packed to the maximum everytime I go there yet they still have a smile on their face every time they serve you, I am yet to taste a dish that is bad at this location! their sushi and rolls are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi is a new concept for me. We don't have it where I'm from. Which is surprising, because we have AYCE everything else...

It actually (kind of, sort of, maybe) blew my mind a little. Free healthcare, Tim Hortons, Hakka food, ketchup chips, shows like Orphan Black, and unlimited sushi. My goodness, I miss and love Canada. 

I don't really miss and love Sushi Sushi though. I'm actually not sure how we (a group of five) ended up here, but it happened, and while I wasn't severely disappointed or disgusted, there were a lot of misses along with a few hits. 

A lot of the Teppanyaki items were pretty enjoyable. Basically, anything with meat in it was pretty good (I would be surprised if they managed to mess up something like the Grilled Green Onion Beef Roll). There was some noodle dish with beef in it where the beef was weirdly chewier than I would like. The tempura battered stuff was legit, but I don't know if they can take too much credit for the magic of deep frying food in oil. 

The namesake on the other hand was really boring. The nigiri was fresh, as were the maki rolls, but the maki rolls all tasted the same to me. The only thing that seemed to change was the texture. I is disappoint (slightly).

I ordered the Pad Thai because... Pad Thai. I didn't know it was possible for food to taste like nothing, but Sushi Sushi pulled it off. The only thing that was Pad Thai-ish about that Pad Thai was the color of the noodles. Seriously. Words can't begin to describe that bland dish. Flavor profiles were... \"Chewy\" and... \"Noodley\"?

Even as someone who has never experienced an AYCE sushi joint before, I have to say I was only moderately impressed. There were enough good items for me to say it was A-OK but I doubt I'll be back if I have any say in the matter.

Summary: Somewhere between [A-OK hand-gesture] and [Meh hand-gesture]. [*][*] and some change rounded up to [*][*][*]."}
{"text":"We decided to try this newly opened sushi bar Wednesday evening because it is very close to our house. The decor is lovely, the service was super-polite and quick. The restaurant was very clean and they use reusable chop sticks which are always a plus for me as I try to be as green as possible. They had a New Zealand lamb special which was delicious. The sushi was pretty good compared to other places although some of it (the white tuna) didn't seem that fresh but I attribute that to the fact that it was mid-week and they are new so the more customers they get the better it will be I'm sure. They had a neat ice cream dessert that was inside a little rice dough pocket and they had a pretty good selection on the menu overall. The reason it didn't get a 5 from me is because there wasn't anything amazing about the place but we will definitely go back and would recommend it to everyone in the area."}
{"text":"We came for a dinner.  My BF ordered a bento box that had grilled salmon, Californian rolls, shrimps and vegetable tempura, rice and salad.  I ordered assorted sashimi on rice (Chirashi).  

My Chirashi was decent.  The various sashimi slices were sufficiently fresh.  They were of good size, though it could be a bit thicker.  The sushi rice was well made and flavourful.  

I had a taste of my BF's bento box.  Again, things were reasonably good.  The shrimp in the tempura was a bit smaller than usual.  Like the saishimi, the salmon was a good size, though I wish it could be thicker.  The rice in the bento box was Jasmine rice.

In the cases of both the sashimi and the salmon, the sensation/texture was compromised because the slice was not thick enough.  I think this should be easy for the restaurant to remedy."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening and this place was quite dead.  Service was good and thought the pricing was pretty cheap.  However, the quality was amateur at best.  When the food came, it did not look fresh.  The sushi has way too much rice on the side and I don't even think they use Japanese rice. I believe they use Jasmine rice.  Was left very unimpressed and would not go back again."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has gone downhill since my last visit back in 2013.

First off, service was terrible. We arrived for dinner and waited at the front to be seated. No one came to seat us. We decided to find a table and seat ourselves. Then a server came by and asked us to move to another table. She seated us in a booth with ripped seats and right by the garbage. The table wasn't clean and the napkin that was provided to my boyfriend had a large soy sauce stain on it. One of our cups and plate was dirty.

The food sort of made it up for the terrible service and uncleanliness of the restaurant. The food came by quite fast. The maki rolls were quite large and stuffed with lots of rice. The unagi and cucumber roll mostly had cucumber. The sashimi didn't look very fresh.

Not even an hour after we left I got stomach pains and I threw up. All I can say is I am never coming back."}
{"text":"For some reason, this place is many peoples favourite AYCE sushi place...but I feel it's because they haven't really been to any good ones.
Sushi Sushi USED to be great...but as their prices slowly raised, their service and quality lowered. Some of the food is great, and some is just asked to be pushed aside. Not to mention the service is pretty ridiculous. 100% of the time they mess up something. Either you keep getting the wrong dishes, or missing half your dishes. Why is it so hard to follow a table number? I've NEVER gone here and had my order 100% correct. It's on a piece of paper!! With the table number!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this place for the first time today through Just Eats since we were too lazy to go out today and the food tasted fresh.  We were told that our food would arrive in an hour but it was delivered faster, within 45 minutes, and with friendly service too. 

I ordered the sushi and sashimi bento box, which came with salmon sushi and sashimi, California rolls, bowl of rice, miso soup, and salad. It was definitely a complete meal that left me full and content by the end. My husband ordered a side of assorted tempura so I tried the scallop pieces and they melt in your mouth. Also, I was very impressed with the presentation of the food when it was delivered. Most Japanese takeout places simply pack everything in styrofoam containers but Sushi Sushi packed my sushi and sashimi pieces in a nice fancy tray and our sides came in these high quality plastic containers. This tells me that the staff really takes pride in their business. 

Pricing for this place, I think, is on par with other restaurants that specialize in Japanese food. My bento box and my husband's was $11.99 each and the side of tempura was $8 and in total our order was around $44, which includes tax, delivery, and tip. Although the food was not bad quality, it wasn't anything extraordinary compared to the sushi I've had at 168 Sushi or Dai Ichi. 

Nevertheless, I will still keep them in mind for the future when I'm craving Japanese again but don't feel like going out to eat. Perhaps, we might even try their dining service someday too if we are in the area."}
{"text":"We got here fairly often for a good ole AYCE sushi fest. Food is fresh, usually quick, and pretty tasty. I mean it's not the high-end sushi you might get somewhere else, but it's done well, tastes fresh, and is fairly affordable.
Service is good too - professional, courteous, and speedy. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on her recommendation. I've discovered in the past our sushi tastes differ and this trip was no different. She is all about value -- if it's a good price for AYCE, she's there. I would much, much rather pay a bit more and get quality sushi. I will not be returning here. For lack of better words, the sushi here tasted like \"cheap sushi\", which I have often found at AYCE restaurants. Seriously, take your money up the street to Sushi in Sushi, which is a la carte but much better quality. I have yet to find an AYCE sushi place in Mississauga that I would return to."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT - Their more unique selling point is their tepanyaki in which the grill is in the corner rather than you sitting around it. 

It's a clean and nice place to eat, kinda a homey feel.

FOOD - Food-wise, meh. I was disappointed in what they offered. We got 3 lunch combos for around $8-9. All of which came with miso soup (standard, not much to say). 

We got the tepanyaki beef and chicken combo, as well as a sushi combo (salmon rolls). The meat combos were just a bowl of rice, salad, and slices of beef/ chicken cooked on the tepanyaki grill. I honestly could have made this at home. I'd pay $8 to go to a Japanese food court instead.. I think you get better value for your money there."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the food was the service.

Maki Rolls - way too much rice (and too little fish).  Also, the rolls tend to fall apart.  Other reviews on here have stated the same (I wish I had read those first).

Sushi Pizza - liked the spicy sauce, but apart from that it was mediocre at best.

Octopus Wheat Balls - these were actually pretty decent.

Service - Very poor.  We had to ask for water, twice.  They never asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  We didn't get any soy sauce containers (I had to go to the cash and get it myself because she never came to check on our table).  Horrible service.

I would not recommend this place.  I'm honestly confused by how busy it was in there.  Save your money and fulfill your sushi cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am going to give this joint a solid 3 stars. 4 stars for the food quality and freshness but 3 stars for the d√©cor and service. They have a decent all you can eat menu and the regular menu is very good as well and offers you several other non sushi options. The service definitely needs to improve here, as our server messed up our first order then forgot to correct the mistake on the bill. Food here is very fresh and for Mississauga, this is not a bad sushi option. At least the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Live this place been here too many times to count! Friendly staff and good sushi, always keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner and we ordered the Cooking Table - Dinner Specials.

Most of us ordered chicken and squid, sushi, and some sashimi.

The sushi/sashimi was meh - it wasn't bad but it wasn't the best thing I've had.

However, the price does match what they give you;
The Special included: miso soup, salad, and the main entree for $9.99."}
{"text":"Though AYCE is a concept that's been in the GTA East forever, it never really done well in the GTA West.  Until recently, there were only 168 sushi and Yang's for the longest time.  Now with JJs and Prince Sushi, Wasabi, Sushi Sushi, and AYCE in Square One, there is a bit more choice.  In my views, none of the AYCE compares to restaurants that offer a la carte. I think Maison du Japon and Ten Ichi in the GTA East are probably the best AYCE experiences I've had so that's my barometer.

Sushi Sushi is a decently sized restaurant that is clean and you're not scared to order from the menu because you saw something crawling under the table.  The staff can be slow but aside from Maison and Ten Ichi, I've never had great service at an AYCE.  They're pleasant enough here... provided you can get their attention.  The menu selection is not poor but it's not phenomenal.    I would say their quality is probably not great compared to places like Sushi House, Toshi, and Kumai but for $15 lunch buffet, it's pretty decent for Mississauga.  There's no sashimi offering for lunch but there are maki rolls, sushi, and bunch of cooked items (teriyaki, ramen, udon, tempura...).  

The sushi and maki rolls are made sloppily but I wasn't expecting perfection for a Friday lunch rush hour.  I wouldn't ask for the miso soup again... really salty.  Tempura is oily and soft.  I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauces on the maki rolls are overpowering so I'd ask them to hold off on that.  

For $15, it's a fairly good deal but don't expect to get everything eaten in a business lunch hour with the slow service or find good quality sushi that belongs at a la carte place."}
{"text":"i have to say i was really disappointed with this place. I've been to a LOT of all you can eat sushi places in my time and this has to be the most disappointing one i've been to ever. But i don't have the heart to give it a 1 star.

If you had one maki roll here. you've had them all. because every single roll is basically rice, seaweed, imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber. EVERY SINGLE ROLL. with slight variations to them.

i wasn't even full but i didn't want to eat anymore because i got bored of the stuff i was eating.

most of the time i would give a place a second chance because i believe there is some sort of room for improvement that could be a game changer but really, there are so many good all you can eat sushi places, why would i even give this place a second thought?

well if i talk about second thoughts too much it might happen and make me move my mouse up a little bit and hit 1 star so i'll stop there."}
{"text":"Big Sign screaming SUSHI SUSHI, hey how can I resist.. as sushi definitely is my weakness... 

Sushi Sushi Japanese Restaurant aside from serving sushi, they have what they call Tableside Cooking. It really is their version of having a Teppanyaki in the dining area, so customers can watch their food getting prepare.. 

Lunch Special starting at $4.99, I should not be complaining?? But the sushi itself was disappointing... 

Sushi Set ($7.99) 
- It came with the MOST salty Miso Soup I ever tasted in my life... just saltiness that send my blood pressure up the ceiling... I just could not even eat that... 
- Sushi presentation looks cute.. in a sense that the shari rice ball are miniature in sizes... and the fish itself were not fresh, except the salmon... 

Services are A-OK.... I know it is not fair to rate this restaurant just based on my Sushi Set... but as a sushi joint that call itself Sushi Sushi, they cannot do the basic thing right. 

Maybe the teppanyaki might be better... I would suggest just skip the sushi at Sushi Sushi.. or just skip Sushi Sushi completely!"}
{"text":"I was traveling and staying at a nearby hotel so I ordered delivery and it came in the amount of time as promised. I ordered a Philadelphia roll and boy did they skimp on the cream cheese. Also not sure how small the cucumbers were but my rolls were mostly skin without much cucumber meat. I also ordered edamame and it was not even salted. I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"A little sushi place up in Markham.  I came here on a weekday lunch with coworkers. 

All in all, it's a very average sushi restaurant. The owners are very friendly and warm, fast with service, but the food is very average. Their sushi had too much rice, not enough fish. 

If you're not picky with your sushi and are looking for convenience, their prices are good enough to be a reasonable option. But if you want really good sushi, you're better off looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by family members. For my wife and I, it was mediocre. Anyways? This place is closed ita doors  August 21 2016."}
{"text":"I had been going to Sushi Sushi for TWO years. TWO years. In the beginning, they started as \"okay prices for fair food\" - but their food quality now is absolutely abysmal. Their wait staff is rude AND their prices are downright unfair. Getting charged more than the guy beside me who ordered the same thing? No thanks.

I had a terrible experience when I asked about a food substitution the other day. I saw another customer get it so I decided to inquire more about it. The waitress was rude and told me to ask the owner and said there was no such thing. Attitude - super disappointing. Never coming back. How can a restaurant like this still be open while so many other far superior Japanese restaurants operate nearby.

Save yourselves the trouble. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"By AYCE sushi standards this is really not that good.

The selection is somewhat limited compared to other AYCE sushi places in Mississauga. The unagi sushi was unusually fishy and strange tasting which was a really big turn off since I love eel.

It really didn't feel or taste that fresh and I was honestly worried but no ill side effects the day after so I guess that's alright.

Service is alright. They're not overly warm or welcoming but I didn't expect much. They are relatively quick though.

Overall, I wouldn't come here again. It's one of those kinds of places where you just go to eat to get full, not necessarily for quality food."}
{"text":"The staff are always sad no smiling on face. Their shrimp tempura is dirty they don't clean the shrimp from the black thing inside the shrimp. Their glass of water are dirty. Their washroom is disgusting. I will not go their anymore."}
{"text":"The staff here are extremely friendly and the prices are also really good. We got the bento box special, at most is $10 with a variety to fill you up. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. My gf and I each ordered a sushi bento box. Each costed $13. The food tasted good but the portion size could definitely be improved. The beef teriyaki I ordered was pretty small and there was only 3 pieces of sushi in the bento box. Other than that the service was fast and waitress was polite."}
{"text":"Most all-you-can-eat-sushi places serve up low grade sashimi. But not Sushi Sushi! Their Salmon Sashimi is fresh and flavourful! The sushi is not bad either.

Their staff is friendly and helpful. Ambience is clean and bright. We had kids at our table (and so did 3-4 of the tables around us) and the staff was quick to seat us (including the high chairs; that we often wait for at other restaurants); and very quick to serve us as well. 

Made the whole experience delightful!"}
