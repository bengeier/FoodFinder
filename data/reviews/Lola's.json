{"text":"Buffet style hot lunch with separate sandwich line and salad bar.  Prices reasonable. Food had been on warmer too long.  Edible but not delectable. Nice decor but I would clean better."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and great!  Nice spot close to our hotel (Hilton Garden Inn) and a fraction of the hotel breakfast cost."}
{"text":"We were sad when Lola's Tapas on Camelback Road closed a couple of years ago.  How exciting to see Lola's has reopened in The Yard on North 7th Street!  Our party of three had no problem with reservation, parking or seating.  Service was attentive and excellent.  The tapas were outstanding!  My favorite was the gambas (shrimp) pil-pil.  We also shared a thin sliced filet mignon, chicken breast in tomato sauce, and jamon serrano with Manchego cheese.  The prices were very reasonable, and the fun and games atmosphere of The Yard served as an entertaining background.  I will definitely return to Lola's."}
{"text":"This place is no frills with AMAZING food at a great price.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Upon entering, you will wait on line (which can get long) to order your food at the counter. I got the fried chicken, jalapeno cornbread, dirty rice and sweet potatoes. Everything was absolutely delicious (though salty). This is definitely not a place for those counting calories. I rounded out my meal with a sweat tea all for about $8. Again, this place isn't much to look at but it's clean and the food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went to lola's for the first time today i had the mac and cheese fried chicken and green all which were great the employees where friendly and i overall great experience"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and decor. I came here for breakfast hoping to find a good cup of coffee, something to eat and wifi to do some work on my laptop. They did not disappoint in that respect. Great cafe latte, they had wifi and my egg white omelette was edible - and I'll stop at that. The word palatable or delicious would only be used to describe the herbed potatoes (come with the omelets) if a gun was put to my head. In fairness, not much you can do with potatoes if you choose to serve them. But that's the point, don't come here for a delicious breakfast.  Some people \"do breakfast\" and don't really focus on decor or ambiance; this place is about the latter, not the former.   Lola apparently also just opened as the cashier and cook both responded to questions with \"I'm new here.\"  Why would I be talking to the cook at a restaurant you're thinking? Well, I was given a number tab by the cashier which would ordinarily cause one to believe his or her food/drink/order would be brought to him or her. Nope. After about 5 minutes the cashier brings me my latte and says, \"It's been ready for pick up at the counter.\" As I look at the tab I think, \"Why did you give me this then? \" A few minutes later, the cook yells out, \"Number 2 is ready.\" That's my cue I guess. The tab was apparently in case I forgot my number. When I asked the cook for a knife and fork to eat the food is when he explains \"He's New\" and has no clue. The cashier points me to the plastic knives and forks on the counter.  As I walk my food to my seat, I pass a station where silverware is rolled in a napkin so I grab that and leave the plastic for the more adventurous."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! They are in my opinion the only good authentic soul food restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lola's is amazing. The Sheraton was charging $18 for breakfast, even if you just wanted a bagel. I walked over to Lola's and had a breakfast sandwich on the best biscuit I have ever had. Ever. And, it was about $3. Great staff, generous portions, excellent food.  This is a breakfast and lunch place.  I returned to Lola's this year when I was in Charlotte and still think this is the best breakfast sandwich/biscuit I've ever had - and at an amazing price. Where else can you buy one scrambled egg for fifty cents? (My friend ordered two scrambled eggs and nothing else from room service  at a hotel nearby and was charged $21!) the coffee isn't great, though, so buy food here and get coffee at your hotel.   Cash/check only. Directly across from NASCAR's entrance, at the corner of MLK and Brevard, and a block from the convention center."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place! Great service! Great environment! Great coffee, sangria and tapas!  Great date place! I could go on and on. Also, the owner engages with the guests... I like when owners do this, it makes me feel important."}
{"text":"If not for the unwelcome experience given by a staff member I would give a higher rating. Today me and my co-workers from Preferred Electric decided to have breakfast here upon their recommendation. We all lined up to order and I was at the end of the line. Everyone was served as expected but for some reason when it was time to take my order the young lady at the counter ignored me.  She didn't say anything, she straightened the counter right in front of me and on the other side of the counter then walked away! I was the only customer remaining and i was left standing there. I could tell by her facial expression that it was personal and the intent was not to serve me.  The other lady saw me standing there and asked \"did she take your order?\" I said \"no and I wonder why she ignored me like that\" The second lady then said jokingly \"I'll smack her for you.\" She was very nice and made which was a very embarrassing experience as pleasurable as it could possibly be.  First I'd like to say I will not be returning here again and secondly I wonder what the company would have to say about what felt to me like discrimination!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?  I was at the Charlotte convention center. I'm not into any food being sold there so I ask one of the security people what's near. Without thinking twice she says, \"you want to go to Lola's! Then come back here and tell me how much you liked it!\" The line was long but moved quickly. I saw chicken fried steak on the menu and did not see a need to look any further. I get to the counter and the nice young woman asks what side I want. I go for the mac and cheese so she puts a big scoop on the plate and hands it off to the next person. Person number two is...grandmotherly. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. She looks at my pile of mac and cheese, grabs the scoop and dumps another one on top. Mmmmmmm hmm! I opt for the total starch fest and get some mashed potatoes. My new grandmother figure asks if I want gravy, but asks in a way that you cannot say no.   I'm loaded up with a ton on my plate AND cornbread, I stop for an iced tea and at the checkout counter are small styrofoam containers. \"What's in those?\" I ask the checkout person. \"You should get one.\" \"OK...but what are they?\" They are banana pudding...and they are awesome.   I walk outside with enough food to feed a family of 6 and proceed to eat way too much. Everything is great. (I didn't eat again until the next day.)   If you're at the convention center (or otherwise nearby) and it's lunchtime. Stop reading and walk now."}
{"text":"Typical southern food place. I had no issues with my meal, I just prefer to eat a little better. Don't bring your girlfriend here if you want her to stay skinny!   Jalapeño corn bread was where's it's at. The greens were good as well."}
{"text":"Nice breakfasts. Good quality and reasonable prices. Suitable place for whose don't want spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for lunch in the uptown Charlotte area and happened to chance upon this gem. We walked in and the line was beginning to curl around the restaurant but it moved surprisingly fast. I had the fried fish and mac-n-cheese while my husband had the fried chicken and collards. We both ordered candies yams, cornbread, and sweet tea. I can honestly tell you that the food here was well worth the line and I would wait even if it had been wrapped around the building. I am somewhat of a down-home mac-n-cheese purist. I don't really care for the new-age mac's with ingredients like fontina, gouda, microscopic pieces of lobster, and truffle OIL (they don't even give you the real truffles most of the time! Cheap!) Why reinvent the wheel to create a square? The southern traditional sharp cheddar and condensed milk goodness is where it's at, and this one hit the spot. The fried fish and collards reminded me of family reunions. The fried chicken was juicy on the inside, crispy on the out. The sweet tea and yams might have given me diabetes, but it would have been sooo worth it. The only thing I will say is that the cornbread wasn't the best, but that doesn't deter me from giving this place the full 5 stars. I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lola's, when you're good, you're the BEST in town. Literally, I drive 10 minutes to taste your whipped cream. However, the past 3 times, you have not made it... All 3 times were spaced out by weeks and you still blamed the same broken whipped cream dispenser for why it was out. The coffee is amazing, when it's prepared by certain people. Fix the inconsistency, and us coffee lovers will be SO happy!"}
{"text":"The food at Lola's is absolutely delicious !!!! When you want real food (meat and vegetables) this is the place to go. It is conveniently located and the staff is well mannered. I have been numerous times for lunch and waiting for the opportunity to try breakfast. As a matter of fact tomorrow morning is beginning to look real good!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! The food was amazing. Had to wait a while to get it, but definitely worth the time.  Had the fried chicken, collards and mac n cheese All were well seasoned and not overly greasy.  The chalkboard menu was a bit quaint and the tea bit too sweet, but with food this good who cares. A new fan!"}
{"text":"Last month I attended a conference at the Charlotte Convention Center.  As we left for lunch we exited the building onto MLK Street.  There was an employee of the CCC posted up outside to help direct foot traffic.    \"Can I help you with something?\" \"We're looking for somewhere to eat.\" \"What kind of food y'all have in mind?\" (Shrugs) \"It doesn't matter...just something good.\" (No hesitation) \"Lola's then.  It's right down on the corner.\" \"Um, ok.  What's Lola's?\" \"Southern, soul foo--\" \"Sold!  Say no more.  Thanks!\"  I took off down the street with a smile on my face.  I love soul food and Lola's didn't disappoint.  When we got there about 15-20 people were in line ahead of us.  However, by the time made it through and sat down with our food the line snaked out the door.  I'm not certain if it's always that packed or if it was just convention center volume.  In any case, I really enjoyed my meal.  I opted for fried chicken, collard greens, macaroni & cheese, cornbread, teamonade (Arnold Palmer to most), and a chocolate chip cookie.  I'm one of those people who pick the skin off fried chicken and since all skinless fried chicken tastes exactly the same...I have no opinion about the chicken.  I will say that my skin-eating tablemate said it was the bomb.  She rolled her eyes back into her head as she said it.  The greens were seasoned really well (they had a slight peppery kick) and the macaroni was tasty too with a cheesy, baked crust on top.    It was one of those times when I didn't really have space in my stomach for all the food but it was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating it.  As I went along I shifted a bit in my seat, trying to open up side compartments in my stomach to make it work.  I'm guessing that's why they serve everything in takeaway containers because they know they're giving you a lot of food.  I had to wrap up the cookie for later.  I waddled out of Lola's feeling like I'd want to make it a weekly thing if I lived in Charlotte.  It's a solid soul food pick."}
{"text":"I have to give a high five to the dinner chef, she has great skills. She made my filet mignon to a perfection that should or would otherwise find at a high end steak house."}
{"text":"Walking up to Lola, it looks great and very modern.  It's open and light, which is what I like to have as an addition to my morning coffee.  There weren't many guests at Lola yet, as it was early but there were many workers and lots to try.  We started off by ordering the Cafe Borgia, wow what a great combo of tangerine and chocolate and the Cafe Blanco, which was a smooth and light white chocolate espresso drink.  I recommend both, I favor a strong coffee that goes down smooth and that's exactly what we got.  We also ordered some fresh orange juice, which was pressed on the spot.  For food we had the Luca Omelette and the breakfast burrito, both were full of flavor and cooked perfectly, seriously.  We also tried the honey lavendar scone, I'm a huge fan of scones and prefer them to melt in your mouth, so yes, full of butter.  We tried the cinnamon roll, you have to check them out and the croissant, which was crisp and flaky with a hint of something that made it extra special."}
{"text":"People, if you want authentic southern cuisine you have to try this place. The people here know what they are doing. I had the smothered pork chops, Mac, and corn bread. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Would recommend it to anyone. I even ate for free because I rolled 2 fives. That is value right there."}
{"text":"This 5-star review is STRICTLY for their jalapeno cornbread.  Can't rate on anything else because I've only had the cornbread brought to me by a coworker.  HANDS DOWN the BEST cornbread I have ever had in my life.  The combination of sweet and spicy is incredibly amazing.    I don't know about the other stuff here but I would come here just to eat the cornbread...mmm."}
{"text":"food wise it would be a 2.5 - 3 at the most, but the place and the coffee made it up for the 4th star.  Let me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed.   The olives were good.   The shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent.  The traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful.  The tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent.  The wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine?  Now the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you.  I didn't check if in the menu they include \"cafe bombon\", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee!  Cheers"}
{"text":"My favourite place to go for lunch! I am addicted to the food here, to the point where my coworkers warn me to relax before I blow up (this ain't light fare we're talking about here)! I've memorized the daily lunch specials. My favorites are the jerk chicken, baked chicken and fried chicken! Plus the chicken and broccoli casserole on Fridays. So rich and creamy and delicious. I am hooked! I love that you don't have to wait for them to make your food here. Just pick and go. Plenty of food for under $9 (includes drink if you pay with cash). And everyone who works here is a delight! I just wish they stayed open later so I could go after work!"}
{"text":"Almost mad I've spent 3 years in the QC without trying this place. Excellent home cooked southern, cheap and smack dab in uptown  (across from mascara hof)."}
{"text":"Good southern veggies - much better than a local soul food place (I won't name names but last name of Ethyl and Fred on I Love Lucy is a hint). I Liked the black eyed peas. Green beans were good but a little bland. Liked the Jalapeño cornbread. (they have plain cornbread too). Yams were sweet but good and like a dessert.   The chicken and sausage gumbo soup of the day was flavorful.  The fried chicken looked pretty good. I wish they offered a chicken fried chicken breast (no bones) with gravy.   This place gets super crowded at lunch, but line moves fairly quickly.   Some veggies only offered on certain days. Not sure why corn is one of these rotating veggies?  Veggies as a meal is not prominent on the restaurant menu, but is a good choice for a somewhat healthier option including a side salad as one veggie."}
{"text":"Just went to Lola's and had a good experience. The shrimp ($18) was enough for 2. We also had an order of the asparagus ($8) shared and we each had a glass of sangria. The sangria did have fruit . Our server, Grady, was friendly and checked on us several times. Fun, noisy place for light dinner!"}
{"text":"Quick recap: Only drawback to this place is the long line. Not because of slow service but rather bc this is delicious soul food that everyone wants. Top notch food.   Fried chicken is on point. Fried fish is on point. Mashed potatoes never disappoint. Bakes beans, green beans, cornbread, it's all delicious. Have yet to order anything that was not incredible.   Large portions overall so come here if you are hungry. Friendly people, fast service, clean location. One of the great spots here in Charlotte for southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Lola's is the BEST Soul food restaurant in Charlotte! If you are looking for consistently good food you've found THE place. I like the setup, when you go in its cafeteria styled and you can either dine-in or they will give you a to-go box that they put your food in. I LOVE  the diverse atmosphere you can catch all nationalities at Lola's that how you know it's delicious!"}
{"text":"First let me say I am a fan of Spanish Tapas! Second let me say I was a HUGE fan of Lola's Tapas in the old location on Camelback.  Lola's was always loud, always chaotic, always fun and always expensive.  But the energy, the Spanish wine, excellent Tapas and quirky vibe was well worth it and made for a great night out!  Parking = nightmare as it is every time you go to the Yard.  The space is FAN-EFFING-TASTIC!  All of the coffee accoutrement is exciting!  We loved the atmosphere, the finishes, and the tremendous energy of all the people playing Ping-Pong, and all of the games out in the yard.  However... there were only three tables with people, including us.  So the vibe was off with the disparity between the two worlds.   The staff was nice, not very up on the menu and a bit inconvenienced by us and/or they were so new they didn't realize that customers are a good thing?  I still can't decide...   After we ordered Walter came by and introduced himself.  I found out a few days later he is one of the owners.     I have to say I was put off by several of the things he was telling us.    1. They haven't started advertising.  Explains the customer situation - almost a month after opening.  2. They are getting rid of the Spanish wines in favor of California wines.    I asked \" Are you trying to make the wine more approachable?\" to which he fumbled a halfhearted yes.  My instinct is that maybe Walter does not like or understand Spanish wine and does like California wine.  Maybe it is just me... but if you take away the second most important thing about a Tapas bar - the Spanish wine - you can't expect to survive as a Spanish Tapas Bar for very long.  I suggested he add a few more Cava to the menu - I don't think my suggestion went far based on his lack of enthusiasm as the conversation shifted to:   3. They are changing the menu and removing some of the Tapas and adding Paella.    Now... I LOVE Paella.  Between my friends and I we have two or three 36-48 inch Paella pans with the grills to cooks them with and a half dozen of the smaller Paella pans. Walter was kind enough to wait while I searched for an old picture of me cooking a 48 inch Paella - so it was off putting when Walter asked me what my favorite Paella was and I told him rabbit and he stood there with his mouth agape.  He said they were going to have vegetable, chicken or seafood Paella. Ok.    Just a suggestion but has to be REALLY good - because mediocre Paella is horrible.  Not that it can't work or be a great addition, but had better be really, really good.  Now to the food:  We ordered the Shrimp, the Steak, the Jamon and Cheese tray and a glass of the one and only Cava.    The Cava was good, ok quality = B-  The Jamon and Cheese tray - had some lovely dates, Jamon was nice but cold like it just came out of the refrigerator instead of being hand sliced at room temp.  The Cheese was ok and the Marcona almonds were fine = C  The Steak arrived on a regular plate - not the traditional Tapas clay dish.  The steak was thin, of poor quality, overcooked and luke-warm.  The plate was cold and hence why the steak was not hot.  The steak didn't have the cumin like at the old Lola's - instead it came with a blue cheese crumble on top, needed salt and pepper = D  The Shrimp also arrived on a regular plate that wasn't heated.  The first few were great, reminiscent of the old Lola's flavor and pizzazz.  Then, because the plate was so cold the shrimp cooled quickly and lost their pizzazz.  Started out as an A and quickly cooled/congealed to a C  I sat there basking in the romantic wine soaked memories of the old Lola's - all of the chaotic energy, bumping into people, yelling over the music, laughing, spilling wine on someone and buying them a new glass as an apology, reaching for that last olive, anxiously waiving down the rushing waiters furiously trying to keep up with the second or fourth round of orders of the shrimp and wine, striking up conversation with the people next to you...  With this excellent space, all of the new coffee equipment, all of the frenetic energy of the Yard Lola's Tapas should be a huge hit.  I sat there willing it to be better, to match the quality of the space, the quality of the coffee equipment the quality of my memories.  I truly hope they don't get rid of the Spanish wine or Tapas.  I hope that they go full Spanish traditional with the clay tapas pots piping hot (just a suggestion).  I hope they add more Tapas like the Croquets con Papas y Jamon, Roast Suckling Pig, Spanish honey with Manchego or Mussels with Cava and Chorizo, Fideos with Chorizo.  I hope they add more Cava, and/or more... dare I say it... Spanish wine.  We will give the time.  The Lola's of old deserves the chance to be reborn in this amazing space."}
{"text":"The coffee is inconsistent- not necessarily  bad mind you, just inconsistent. Depending on your barista it can vary from good  (man with salt and pepper goatee) to terrible, strong to weak, acidic and burned tasting to decent. The seating is bizarre, and outlets are sparse. Its not a good place for a meeting, might be ok for a date.   Dont buy alcohol here because their liquor license wont let you take it to the games, buy from the culinary drop out instead (confusing since they all seem connected).   One more note: this place is CRAZY HOT in the summer. Really inadequate ac for phoenix. I mentioned it to a sweating waitress (who agreed) but nothing changed. I mentioned the heat to a guy who seemed to be a manager who just opened one of their cool garage doors- if anything changed it was hotter.   I havent tried much of the food, mostly coffee shop pastries. The bagels are a great deal, scones were dry and muffins were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for lunch during weekdays and food is A-OK. Couldn't get myself to eat their fried chicken as I had to get back to work, but have tried their fish and veggie dishes - all decent/good and generous portions as well.  They have a loyalty program - stamp card on visit; accumulate x number of stamps to get a free lunch. Thats not bad.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing to be wooed about at the same time. A regular soul food kinda place thats OK for the price you pay."}
{"text":"So I've been off and on Lola's for several years now, since their former location at 401 N. Tryon Street.  This is Southern food, served similarly like a cafeteria.  They have daily specials and items served all week; but I recommend sticking with the daily specials.  For breakfast, they have the usual eggs, bacon, biscuits and such.  The one negative I had was the toast with the liquid butter they used on it... the toast is better without butter.  For lunch, as mention... go with the daily specials.  If Fried Chicken is the special that day, get it.  The sides are the traditional southern sides you would expect, and they do rotate them; so if you wanted fried okra (like I did one day), you might have to come back another day for it.    Food quality wise is pretty good.  Some of the items can be rich (in butter, fat, or other flavor device) and it can settle heavy in the stomach if too much.  I don't recommend eating here daily if you value controlling your waist line; but once a week or two should be okay.  The restaurant is clean with plenty of seating available (inside or out).  Overall, it's very good and worth a visit (but not too often)."}
{"text":"The Serrano ham and manchego app is delish as is the bruschetta with tomato and Burrata. The tortilla Espanola is very good. The traditional paella is very spicy and the chicken is cut up chicken breast which is a bit disappointing as was the fact that there is not actual pieces of chorizo just apparently cooked in but it is still good. The seafood paella is excellent, more traditional to Spanish versions although again a bit on the spicy side. They kept the community tables of their former location but also added tables- it's a fun location. Highly recommend  the coffee also!"}
{"text":"What I Ate:  Baked Chicken, Greens, Black Eyed Peas, Stuffing, Corn Bread  The price is right and the food was great for lunch downtown.  Check it out if you're only here for a couple days and you want to try some real Southern food."}
{"text":"I went to Lola's and I was a little disappointed. Not from the service but just from comparing it to other soul food spots in the city. Mert's, Nana's and Queen Soul Food with Queen being the best of them all but if your downtown I would prefer Mert's. If someone directs you to this place it will serve it's purpose but I won't be returning. Don't really look at this as a negative review but just personal choice based from experience. My decision was based on the portion that I received, price and taste."}
{"text":"The food seems to always taste great. However I will take issue with their portions got the price... I ordered the porks with 2vegetables which were extremely small. No beverage...$9.20"}
{"text":"The sweet potatoes are AMAZING! Instead of just the usual cinnamon, I think they add nutmeg. The fried fish is great...just enough breading and not greasy. You do not go there for the ambience, but the atmosphere is good - the people working there are friendly and the customers all seem like old friends (and make you a friend right away, too). I wish I lived closer...my last visit there was in April and I am thinking of a way to duplicate the sweet potatoes for my Thanksgiving dinner!"}
{"text":"Lola's has delivered pretty good food for some time, it's a nice change of pace for uptown that I often forget about, but they have really good veggies(especially the homemade dressing), fried/baked chicken and fish, everything is seasoned nicely....you can dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"I've NEVER been disappointed at Lola's. We brag about the food there all the time. I'm seriously thinking Lola's should buy out K&W and make that place WAYYYY  BETTER! I love the collard greens, mashed potatoes and honestly, altho I'm a vegetarian, that meatloaf calls to me every time I go there. Keep up the good work Lola's!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so terribly sad to find out that LoLas is closing its doors! The building that houses LoLas has been bought by a new owner, an owner that wants way to much money for the space! LoLas is my favorite breakfast and lunch spot and I will miss going here and rolling the dice for the chance to have a free lunch! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they decide to hunt for a new location rather than permanently closing its doors!!"}
{"text":"Excellent open face chicken fried steak sandwich, with mash potatoes and gravy. Fried chicken also very good."}
{"text":"We went here on our visit to Charlotte based on their great Yelp reviews. Don't let the line scare you because it moves pretty fast! Food was great. Don't forget to roll the dice before you pay because you might get food for free!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem within the Yard is sure to become a huge hit considering the experience a friend and I had last night.  We received the best service, hands down, at a restaurant in a long time.  Grady bent over backwards to make sure we had an incredible evening.    We sat outside and enjoyed an unseasonably cool August evening...how lucky for us!  We enjoyed the hummus, jamon & manchego plate, white sangria, gambas and a side of the spinach and chickpeas.  Everything was flavorful, fresh and downright delicious.    I'll definitely be back and look forward to trying the paella next time!"}
{"text":"You should continuously bring water. What is with this place? After Happy Hour, service declines. If then. Where the heck is our water? We've asked every time and then, when I go to to the bar to ask, she wants ME to deliver the check?!?! We've ordered Happy Hour and beyond. Only because we waved someone down! You don't want us to order any more?!? Fine, I'm not interested! I just want water!"}
{"text":"Wow! I went to Lola's for a private Christmas party and MAN! it was good! I had never been here before and I definetly look forward to going back. I had some AMAZING post roast. It was flavorful, tender and juicy. I've had some good pot roast, but this one was, dare I say, the best!! Everything else was on par too. The collard greens & mashed potatoes were probably my favorite sides (we had a buffet-style meal). The staff was very pleasant and my meal was delicious! Will be going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. A team from our school was at an educators conference and found this treasure. If you stop in tell Bruce (the owner) his new friends from Indpls, IN said \"Lola's has the BEST Sweet Potato Pie ever!!!\""}
{"text":"I love this space, the ambiance, the long table, the bar overlooking The Yard where people drink and play in the evenings.  So 5 stars for the space and coffee 4.5  stars for food. Beer could be a bit less expensive... I love coming here, but I hate the fact that most of the time you need to use valet parking."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed here because the food is decent and at a  reasonable price. It's not the best soul food in charlotte but surely the best uptown.  All the sides and entrees are good (try the mac & cheese and the cabbage) but i really hope they start to add some kick to the jerk chicken. It makes no sense to serve mild jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this restaurant, and it is by far my favorite place in Charlotte get some great southern food! The fried chicken, dirty rice, mac n' cheese and mashed potatoes are all delicious. This place definitely provides a welcoming, relaxing environment, and the customer service was very pleasing. I can't wait to taste other items on their menu."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the peach cobbler was one of the best I've ever had. The staff was very nice,  the food was fresh and the price was right. I was stuffed when I left. I had roast, black eyed peas, greens and peach cobbler. This is located near the NASCAR museum and worth trying!"}
{"text":"Lola's is my go to lunch spot for affordable and quick soul food. The menu changes daily except for the regular baked chicken and meatloaf. The food is always fresh, hot and flavorful and you always receive generous portions. The line gets pretty long during lunch so I would suggest going early or a little after the normal lunch hour. The meatloaf and Mac and cheese is always my go to entree."}
{"text":"Great Southern comfort food. The meatloaf is awesome! It is a great lunch spot in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"We came to Lola's tapas for the first time a while ago, when the weather was still nice : ) (Around April) At first I was not so sure, but then I loved the concept. Small menu, great service, fun environment. Daniel H was our server and he was outstanding. We met some good friends that we had not seen in a while (one of them from out of town) and we spent the whole evening here...  Do you know how is like when you are catching up and you stay a little longer, and then the staff starts giving you 'the eye'? Well, here they did not give us 'the eye', they gave us a dessert to share! since they noticed we were catching up and we were done with our dinner, check paid and everything. Some other places don't even refill your drink and here we got a dessert? This is a place where they really know how to sets themselves apart.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot in the AT&T building, really sad they are closing down because of the construction. The daily specials are great, especially fried chicken Fridays. Gotta get the jalapeño cornbread too. Fingers crossed they find a new location uptown soon."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and so is the price! I came here and got the jerk chicken, macaroni & cheese, and collard greens, and I'm looking forward to my next visit. The only downside is the hours of operation -- being in a business district means they mostly cater to the 9-5 crowd. I'd eat this stuff all day!"}
{"text":"I was in charlotte for work, and even though it was 16 degrees outside, i needed to venture out of my hotel for some food.  Didn't know where to go within walking distance of my hotel, so I asked the concierge.  He suggested Lola's within walking distance from Hyatt Place.   It is a charming little restaurant that resembles a cafeteria.  Everyday they have a special, and on the day I was there, I had the meatloaf!   IT was delicious, each meal came with some sides and some delicious bread!  Cornbread, regular and jalapeno.  DEFINITELY, go for the jalapeno! All for about $8 a plate!  must try!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of meat-and-three before I moved to the South. Lola's does it up right with an array of meat (chicken, meatloaf, etc.) and side  (mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, black-eyed peas) options.  I went there on a Sunday afternoon and it ended up pretty crowded because the Obama rally had just let out. Finding an affordable restaurant open on a weekend in Uptown was pretty exciting because most of that area shuts down when the office buildings are closed. The cafeteria-style restaurant had friendly employees, though they were a bit overwhelmed by the usually large number of customers."}
{"text":"I am SO glad these guys are back in all their glory. They are PERFECTLY located on my way to work for coffee and I've indulged several times already. You can never go wrong with their espresso as it is nicely balanced: not too mild, not too bold.   I came back the other night to try their tapas. Their filet was a delicious as I remember it. Tender and juicy with their bleu cheese butter....SO damn good. You can run up a bill pretty quickly, the filet and two glasses of wine ran over $50 but it was worth it. Not something I can do all the time, but I AM still waiting for my grade in Public Affairs research, so I hopefully will be treating myself again...soon!  The atmosphere is nice enough but the fluorescent lighting from the kitchen area spills over to the rest of the venue which doesn't make for the most pleasant atmosphere. It would be nice to have a little more ambient light in the bar area, perhaps some candles. It's VERY nice space, they just need to figure out the lighting.  I haven't tried their sangria yet but I hope it's like it was at the old place with the \"crack\" berries. Anyway, I'm glad they're back and I look forward to being a regular."}
{"text":"Decided to try their breakfast options. Went with the Southern Breakfast. Best biscuits and gravy since I've moved to Charlotte. Chunky sausages in the gravy. Eggs were fluffy and soft. Potatoes were lightly seasoned with bits of onions and peppers. Such a content homey feeling eating this. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Simple, good, filling Southern food. Best collard greens in town by far (if you like them, I do). I usually eat here multiple times a week since I work close by. The staff is nice and friendly. The place is nothing fancy, but it's the food that keeps people coming back. Highlights: fried chicken, cornbread, smothered pork chops, collards (worth mentioning again), cabbage, black-eyed peas, fried okra (but they don't have it every day), macaroni and cheese, and meatloaf. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Lolas is awesome all the way around, wish they were open nights and weekends. From entrees to desserts everything is fresh, flavorful, and delicious. My only con is parking to get there but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"THE place to go for southern food! You won't be disappointed. It's like my mom and grandmother were in the kitchen themselves! Very well seasoned food and friendly staff! I do wish they had dinner hours but regardless - try their food, you won't regret that you did!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty horrendous if I might say so myself.  The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review.   Definitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender.  But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar.  The sliders were not really pleasant  and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely.  Will I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up.  If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar.  Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if  I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water.    When i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself.  I literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout.  *threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone. Not to me. When you come to a restaurant you would hope for consistent service not once at the beginning. That's like getting seated at a restaurant and not getting any service afterwards. I love how people want to say that I am wrong and not making a factual speculation. Good god people. ***update it is currently 8/31/14 and no one from management has obviously reading these reviews which is a shame. Lack of concern on their part id say.***"}
{"text":"I haven't had the coffee yet, so can't comment on that side of Lola's. I did however enjoy their patio view of The Yard, while sipping on sangria and nibbling on tapas. Service was very good, attentive but not overly so...accomodating, prompt, fun/friendly/casual. Nice balance. Sangria was great, and tapas we had were all delish! The shrimp was fantastic! I really liked the eggplant stack, tasty enough that my eggplant hating husband even enjoyed it! The warm bread and cheesy spread were addictive. Will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Lola's is located on the ground floor of the office in which I worked this week, so it became the logical place for which I picked up my lunch on my first day in Charlotte.  I ordered the buffalo chicken strips, a side of seasoned fries, and a soda.   It cost me somewhere around 8 bucks and the food tasted good, fresh, and plentiful.   For the price, it's certainly good value and I did enjoy that they prepared my food then & there, even if that meant waiting a few minutes for it to be ready.  They also serve a variety of sandwiches and burgers, so selection is quite good."}
{"text":"Great comfort food! Right by the Hilton City Center Hotel which was nice and convenient!"}
{"text":"So disappointed they changed their drink menu and dropped my favorite from the menu (Cafe Borgia)  That's why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5 that it was before that change.  Otherwise the food is good-mostly breakfast and the tapas I had were good as well.  I was a big fan of the old place and excited that they were returning.  I love that they're combining the coffee shop and the restaurant, but hope they don't change it to much more.  If it ain't broke don't fix it."}
{"text":"Man, this place was amazing. Literally couldn't have found a better southern restaurant on the east coast. The people here were amazing, the ambiance was great, and let's not forget the delicious food! The place is just amazing all around, especially Bruce. He was such a great host and really helped me feel at home. I came down with some friends from Boston, and they fell in love. The place is amazing, I'm going here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What a FANTASTIC place to go eat. Real home made cooking and for a very fair price. Had the Steak Tips over Rice with two sides ( Pinto Beans and Mash Potatoes) and it was awesome  so good that I went back inside after my meal and took another one (Baked Chicken, Mac N Cheese & Dirty Rice) to go for dinner. Just ate dinner now and it was just as good.  From out of town, but every time I'm in Charlotte, I will be sure to come back to Lola's.  Place was clean, and people in there were very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the Roast beef with Mac and Cheese and some scrumptious mashed potatoes. yummmmmmmy is all that I can say. I will try not to go back more than once a month for dieting purposes, but is surely gonna be difficult!"}
{"text":"So far, I've only ben for breakfast, but I loved it! 1. It's at the Yard, which is really fun and a great location. 2. They have fancy coffee and tea drinks made by people who really love coffee and tea. 3. Delicious pastries, but also some healthier options like oatmeal and a quinoa bake. 4. The ambiance inside the actual restaurant is hip/industrial. Go there. Eat there. Get coffee. Drink. Hang out. You'll love it."}
{"text":"This location is a real step down from its predecessor. The first time I went it was a few days after opening. I ordered a cinnamon roll. Although warm, this pastry was rock hard and tasted as if it had been made with of garlic and then had been dipped in olive oil. The hot chocolate was adequate. When I went to the original Lola it was a hot Arizona day and I desperately  needed a refreshing beverage. When you walk inside you instantly smell the delicious scent of coffee beans. I ordered a lemonade. It was lemony and tart and cold and sweet and defiantly refreshing. It was everything you could ask from a glass of lemonade and more. But the yards Lola is such a disappointment. Their lemonade tastes like a watered down, too sweet, processed minute maid beverage. It's almost impossible to compare the two."}
{"text":"You can sufficiently judge how much a coffee shop knows its craft by the drip coffee.  My 16 oz. drip coffee was the absolute worst coffee. I would rather the usual burnt Starbucks sub-par cup over what I had today. (3 packets of Sugar in the Raw, honey and cream barely masked the taste.)  To begin with, it was lukewarm. Second, it was the most sour coffee I'd ever tasted. This means that they have no idea how to properly use their 3-foot drip coffee contraption. Sour coffee happens when the grounds are over-soaked/concentrated. Their filter was looking really nasty, as the entire thing was super brown from being soaked for too long. You generally want to leave a little bit of the filter untouched to know that you haven't overdone it.  The coffee crumble cake was so hard, I nearly broke my fork trying to eat it. At one point, I had to hold the fork with one hand while I hit the end of the utensil with my other hand, much like a chisel and stone.  I do love the decor and location of the establishment. However, I would say that this restaurant is merely imitating the coffee culture in Denver/San Francisco without actually having the credentials or ability to deliver on the same quality."}
{"text":"I'm typing as I eat... I could not wait to give out my very elusive 5 star review.  Fantastic food and EXCELLENT service... This is southern hospitality at its finest.  Thank you to all of the Lola staff for making a normal everyday experience, (such as eating)... EXCEPTIONAL.  On to the food.  Mash potatoes are creamy and buttery, delicious.  I chose fried chicken...first of all its juicy and tender.  The fried skin is garlicky and full of herbs.  I had beans, peach cobbler and the jalapeños corn bread.  Thank you Lola's."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch.  The food was good.  I thought the fried pork chop was a little dry.   Greens were good.  Haven't had a chance to try their dirty rice.  Maybe next time I go I will try.  Is it as good as my dirty rice?"}
{"text":"The young lady that served my plate named Tay, was so sweet. Everyone in the restaurant was nice polite and welcoming. I recommend this place I will enclose a couple of black eyed peas dressing and dirty rice. The second picture will be of rice and gravy fried chicken and green beans with cornbread. Delicious, good job they have done indeed."}
{"text":"Great Southern dishes that aren't easy to find in Charlotte anymore."}
{"text":"The best comfort food you could ever want.  Daily specials are excellent.  Nothing fancy but clean and well organized. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"\"We use words like honor, code, loyalty... I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to. \"  Col. Jessep, A Few Good Men Just went to Lola's with my customer \"loyalty\" card in hand (buy 5 specials get 1 free).  I would have had 1 more stamp to go to get a free lunch.  Card Stamp Guy, aka Col. Jessep, took my card and replaced it with a new card which required me to be twice as loyal (10 stamps required).  Said he didn't make the rules, just had to enforce 'em.  He had quite an accumulated pile of confiscated 5-stamp cards in front of him; all those loyal visits down the toilet.   I guess when times are tough, honor goes out the window and restaurants demand extreme loyalty from their customers.  I guess the truth is, there is no free lunch.  But, I can't handle the truth!!!"}
{"text":"Good southern cooking. Wonderful place to get lunch, skip the fast food chains. This place is affordable, offers great comfort food."}
{"text":"My breakfast burrito was unreal. It was the size of a football (and not a burrito, which seems to be a trend in CLT. You're supposed to wrap the whole thing, burritos aren't open faced...) and had me full until dinner.  I really didn't eat lunch, not out of any attempt to starve myself mind you, I was so full that it never occurred to me. And it was tasty too! the sausage had great flavor that really permeated the beast."}
{"text":"Everything that my husband and I tried was exceptional... It is cafeteria style southern cuisine... We tried the fried chicken, collard greens, Mac and cheese, cornbread and black eyed peas... Everything is amazing, and very reasonably priced, my suggestion is to go early and beat the lunch crowd, because it got jammed around 12pm because of neighboring businesses letting out for lunch..."}
{"text":"This little place nestled in to The Yard is awesome! The owner/ manager (not sure which) was so nice and friendly, he even brought over some Kopi Luwak for us to try for my Birthday.  I would definitely recommend this place. The food was great! The staff was so nice. Not a bad thing to say."}
{"text":"Lunch Southern style, can't beat the price.  This place was recommended by a friend as I am fairly new to the area.  Jalapeño corn bread was excellent.  Pork chops were nicely done and tasty.  My rating would actually be 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I visited Lola's twice. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. If I was rating solely on lunch would give 4 stars. Breakfast was just fair. I arrived at 9:30 am not knowing they stopped serving at 10. Since I was in the South I was expecting some real good home fries. I was disappointed with the frozen home fries. They were out of biscuits so could not try them. The bacon and eggs were decent.  Lunch was very good. After 11:30 the line was out the door and so see why. The food was slamming. I had the fried whiting, cornbread dressing, greens and Mac and cheese. Everything was well seasoned and delicious. I am a fan of cornbread dressing   Lola's was great. I finished off my meal with some delicious peach cobbler. Not sure why they were closed on Saturday. I was there for my fraternity convention. There were plenty of hungry men to pack the place out on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Lola's isn't just a restaurant, it's a staple of southern food in Uptown Charlotte. The food will go straight to your soul. Fried chicken Friday is the move, although you have to go early because the lines get long. The sides equally stand up to the main dish; the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and cornbread is outstanding. The breakfast game is also strong, really good for those hangover mornings. The picture that I've posted says a thousand words so I don't think I really need to say any more."}
{"text":"4 star food 2 star service. Fabulous high quality ham, cheese, eggs, bread. We got our own straws, drinks were not filled regularly,  and food served without napkins or silverware. It was not a busy time either  (only 4 other customers) so not sure what the problem was. For the price of the food and ambiance, I just expected the service to complement them."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this was here! Went for a delicious lunch today with two coworkers.  Delicious southern comfort food. I had the barbecue chicken, greens, mac n cheese and jalapeno corn bread. I heard the meatloaf is to die for. Great helpings, well seasoned, and it left me fully satisfied!  A convenient, quick spot in Uptown for lunch. It's quite popular (long line) but the line moved quick and there was plenty of seating. Will definitely be going back!  (get the jalapeno corn bread. I am not usually a corn bread person but it was SO GOOD)."}
{"text":"This will be my shortest review ever. You want soul food? Veggies not cooked with animal fat? The \"BAM!\" don't be in the area without eating at Lola's. Very well seasoned, nice portion, helpful and attentive staff. All I can say is MAN!  Ok came back before leaving town. Nothing changed. Great food, service and price for southern cooking whether you are a meat eater, veggie or vegan. Don't come to Charlotte without stopping in."}
{"text":"Delicious quick breakfast in Uptown Charlotte!  I tried the egg & cheese croissant here as well as an egg white & cheese burrito with spinach, tomato, & mushroom.  Some of my colleagues have tried their lunch and rave about it too, especially their fried chicken...I must come back for that."}
{"text":"Fun laid back atmosphere with great coffee and a really solid menu for foo items. The baked goods are a little lacking and overprice hit otherwise, it's a nice little spot. I prefer the downtown location more but this is definitely a place of choice if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Tender pot roast, creamy well-seasoned mashed potatoes,  vinegary green beans are specialities.  The chicken-and-dumplings were fantastic!  Delicious southern cuisine in the heart of downtown Charlotte.  Don't miss Lola's!"}
{"text":"I learned about something new today. I was at the new Lola Coffee Bar at the Yard on 7th Street. They sell Kopi Luwak for $15 a cup. What is Kopi Luwak you ask? Kopi Luwak or civet coffee, refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and egested by the Asian palm civet. They harvest the coffee beans from the fecal matter of the civet (an asian big cat) and .... I stopped listening after hearing that and worked really hard not to laugh at Walter, the very nice and serious manager of Lola Coffee. He says its a delicacy people are willing to pay for. If you're interested he said to ask for the cat coffee. Good luck!  The new Lola Coffee at the Yard is very nice. They have some cool trendy coffees and machines (cold drip coffee anyone) that look very 50's sci-fi movie. The have tapas at night and a wine bar.  The decor is lovely and I look forward to making this a regular on my coffee rotation."}
{"text":"Why have I not eaten here sooner?? This place has about all the comfort food you can think of. Juggling college, working, and an internship doesn't leave much time for me to go home where this style of food is cooked almost daily. Let me just say that their fried chicken is as good as grandma's!   I got the friend chicken, cornbread, collard greens, and mashed potatoes. No complaints. And it was only like $8!    Parking does kind of suck, I came with my group around lunchtime and the lines were a little long and slow moving, and it's a little awkward getting drinks since the check out line and soda area are close to one another but the food makes up for all of their setbacks."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful. Everything about the decor and architecture is absolutely amazing. The service, not so much. Somewhat rude to customers about requests. Can't say that I'm a fan of the service but I would definitely try again hoping for a friendlier experience."}
{"text":"Down-home cooking that'll make you wanna slap yo mama! The baked chicken was succulent, greens and dressing were properly prepared and seasoned to perfection as well. Service was warm, inviting and pleasant. Lola's is a great lunch spot if you're in the area. Emphasis on \"lunch\" as they are only open during first shift.   This southern style restaurant has lots of character and delicious food to match. There is plenty seating for groups both inside as well as the outdoor patio.   ~Christy"}
{"text":"Some pretty good country cooking served at a good price.  Nothing at all wrong with that.  Agree with Allene T. re. the quality of the cornbread.  LOVE the jalapeno variety.  It's a longer walk from Cubeville than some places I tend to frequent for lunch Uptown but, after loading up on fried or baked chicken, mac n cheese, etc. That's a really good thing!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy food with soul. Business is closing April 29th. I am going to try to eat at this place as many times as I can in the next 30 days. The daily specials are awesome. Fried chicken is special on Mondays and Fridays. Sweet yam is only available on Fridays."}
