{"text":"Caledon Burger Co. occupies an old brick house formerly home to a gourmet food store. There is quite a bit of seating inside as well as several red picnic tables outside. The place was well staffed and everybody was generally friendly.   We had the regular quarter pounder burgers with a side of fries and onion rings. The burgers were quite juicy...you will definitely get messy! I second Charlie K's comments about the chipotle sauce, it was tasty! You get to choose your own burger toppings à la Harvey's...the toppings are your basic standards except for the onions: they offer white, red and later on I heard a customer ask for sautéed. I wish I knew! They must store the sautéed onions somewhere else. The fries are thick cut and taste homemade. The onion rings were crispy and quite good.  Price-wise, it was a little more expensive then I expected for a place outside the city but it's along the same lines as places like Gourmet Burger Co."}
{"text":"We were driving out of Toronto for a hike and seriously, there are a ridiculous number of housing developments out there but nowhere to eat. Being from America, where there's a McDonald's pretty much everywhere, I was pretty surprised. Thankfully, we found this place.   The restaurant had picnic tables out front, but a modern (yet country) feel to it inside. The burgers and fries were cooked fresh which meant a bit of a wait, but totally worth getting a piping hot burger. I ordered the cheeseburger. The patty was substantially sized, pretty juicy, and cooked well. Once your burger comes out, they put whatever toppings you want on it. I had the chipotle sauce which was great and a little spicy. We got a small order of fries to share which was plenty. The fries were wedge cut and you could tell they were just made and hadn't been sitting out for hours.   It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. Airport Dr. has a few places to eat, but I'd definitely recommend this place. Great burgers, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place was renamed/changed ownership a coupla months ago to Paradise Prime Beef Bistro.  The name is somewhat confusing though 'cause it's more a burger joint than a steakhouse.  Stand-alone, house-looking structure is really cute.  Interior is also nicely done up with a barn board feature wall, what looked to be reclaimed pine board floors, industrial style lighting.  Classy, yet still country.  Prices were mid-range, ~$8 for an Angus Burger - no fries/drink included.  Toppings consisted of the usual + other more \"gourmet\" items like crispy scallions, caramelized onions, some kinda sauteed mushrooms, choice of fancy cheeses, etc.  Staff was friendly.  Nice way to cap off a somewhat disappointing trip to a nearby farm.  If I were to change anything, it would be the bun.  It was some kinda fancy ciabatta and I tasted more of the bread than the actual beef.  So if they had a more simple bun, it would've been even better!"}
{"text":"Potentially a good burger but they only let you choose between well done and medium well done! If they're so certain about the quality of their meat then why are they so worried about undercooking it? If it's as good as they say we should be able to order it raw! Service was iffy. The young man behind the counter was, frankly, as thick as two short planks and slow-moving to boot! Won't be going back. Ever. We made the mistake of buying EXPENSIVE Paradise Farm sausages from the freezer. Bad idea. They use a papery artificial sausage skin which makes it feel like you're eating a hot dog wrapped in burnt newspaper! Nasty."}
