{"text":"cheap sushi, $12.99 lunch special is good, made to order and pretty fast. good service always there to refill your water."}
{"text":"Dont eat here. Fish not fresh, yakitori undercooked pink, beef teriyaki dry thinly sliced marinating cut (tasted boiled then quick fried), sushi a bland mush. Wakame salad is not the usual seaweed crunchy strands but some soft leafy chop. Whole operation feels like a two person ma and pa store being creative with their posted menu. They charge more than the posted prices. It is $13.99 for lunch on saturdays, and there is an automatic 10% \"service charge\" for tips as \"most students do not tip\" - but we were 2 adults and a senior. There are much better places to eat in Chinatown. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning of my life. A friend of mine also got sick from eating here, on a completely separate occasion. And the service on a scale from one to suck is somewhere between vacuum cleaner and black hole."}
{"text":"This review pertains to the location on Spadina Ave., south of Dundas St.

My first visit to this place was not the greatest experience.  The waitress specifically asked me to write my all-you-can-eat orders for hot and cold foods on separate scraps of paper.  But the result of this was that half my order went missing for 40 minutes, which meant I sat there like an idiot for 35 minutes after my last food arrival had run out, and they took that long to notice.

To its credit, the restaurant gave me a discount for that meal.

I gave the place a second chance a few weeks later and had no problems.  It is not the most refined sashimi place, but the quality is relatively good across the board.  The salmon and white-tuna sashimi are good, as is the unagi sushi.  They also have mango or green-tea ice cream.  They also have a spicy sesame chicken I enjoy, and their shrimp tempura is excellent, though they've messed up my order a few times. (When I ask for five pieces, please, either give me five pieces, or tell me I can't order that many at once.  Don't just give me three.)

The menu is missing a few staples (such as egg and salmon-roe sushi), not a huge drawback.  However, stay away from the grilled salmon belly -- I've ordered this twice and both times the salmon belly was undercooked and gave me quite an upset stomach.

This Spadina location has now been replaced by a \"Chinese ramen\" (?) restaurant."}

{"text":"This was my first ever AYCE sushi restaurant i've been to. When i went with my sister in the winter season, the service & food was excellent! I loved the young girl teen-looking one, she was really nice. The CN tower pizza was my fave & the shrimp tempura is always fresh. After multiple times coming in, i see a new waiter (which is a guy, guessing he's new) He was really rude, it sucks to eat in and having a rude waiter smirking every time the dish came to our table. HENCE the -2 stars. Big disappointment, it is definenitly very rare coming back because of him."}
{"text":"I wish I can give them a zero star if possible, my friend and I visited this place tonight and we received worse customer service ever , server was giving us attitude the whole night , half of the food we ordered (including all the sashimi) never came. On top of that, server slipped in a 5 dollar tip for herself on the debt card machine before handing it to my friend. When we confronted her, she mentioned that her manager allows her to do this. Stay away from this business, they are shady as hell! And there's way better food around the area"}
{"text":"This was sad, some of the worst sushi I have ever had.

In retrospect, the fact that the place - which is large, recently renovated, and possessing a large, beautiful patio - was almost completely empty on a Saturday afternoon when all the neighbouring restaurants were packed - should have been a huge red flag.  But no, we wanted sushi and decided to try something new... 

The sever brought us warm-ish water (ie, no ice in the glass or pitcher) to start and made us write our own orders.  The food was inedible - and believe me, I am NOT a picky eater.  Everything just tasted off.  The rolls were messy looking, and the salad was kinda wilting and brown.  There was only one server, who forgot to bring me my drink order, even though I asked twice.  The soy sauce was too strong, and the texture of the rolls was just... creepy.

After picking away at our food, we were trying to decide how to address this.  I have never before considered asking the manager to void our bill - but we seriously considered it.  When we brought up how unhappy we were to the manager, he kind of shrugged it off and didn't apply any discounts.  We paid and left, but we will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"I brought my friends to eat here after thinking, \"why not try this place\". Worst mistake ever. Service is terrible. They have at least the manner to seat you and say hello, but terrible service. The waitress just poured the water without any caution and made it splash on the table. On top of that, they pretty much threw the dishes on the table even though the restaurant was empty. Her attitude was very unfriendly and came off as not wanting to be there. The fish was also not even fresh. We tried everything, one of each as much as we could, but everything that came out tasted \"fake\". The wasabi was terrible and the ginger had this artificial taste. I understand every all-you-can-eat restaurant has lower quality compared to an authentic Japanese restaurant, like Ebi Sushi, but it was the worst I've ever tasted.

Not even to be a considered when your looking for good sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEDED. There are better Japanese restaurants than this place.
Food quality was poor and not fresh. Service was poor.  
I tasted better Japanese food than this place for these dinner and lunch prices. They opened another restaurant on Spadina Ave."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the past 3 years. Yesterday will be my last.  It's cheap & the food is mostly passable. Here's the finale for me though: yesterday when there, the waitress was on her cell phone when she delivered our food, when she later brought our check, when she took our money/gave us our change. What! Have we sunk this low?  

Also, I'm a bit skeeved out with anything I don't perceive as clean & I saw the sushi chef rubbing his hands all over his face & hair & then make food without washing them first : (.

Done."}
{"text":"Yuck!

My friends and I stopped by this place since we were in the area. I wish we had gone somewhere else.

Upon entering Kuni Sushi Ya, we were greeted by a friendly server who quickly found us a table for our group. The atmosphere was calm and the decor is very simple, nothing special. They also have a nice patio outside during the summer time. There was a great selection on the menu (dynamite rolls, sashimi, spider maki, noodles etc.) and the prices seemed reasonable too. Our orders we taken and the food came rather quickly.

After looking at the small portions of food we received, I realized that the prices were a bit high for what you got. Also, no one at the table really enjoyed their food. The rice on my sushi was somewhat hard and dry, and the stuff inside the sushi was a little mushy and tasteless. 

The staff working here were very friendly, but provided slow service. Also, the biggest downer on my experience here was watching the guy behind the sushi bar sneeze hard plenty of times into his sleeves while making food while I was eating. I did not get the impression that this restaurant was a clean place.

They're other better sushi places in the area that I rather go to. I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Overall not worth coming to save a few bucks, food is bad.

Pros: 
- Cheaper than average

Cons: 
- Food here is absolutely bad, sashimi not fresh, sushi poorly made, worst than food court
- Unlike other ayce, you have to write your order on plain white paper
- Lack of staff = extra slow service
- Half your order will be missing or wrong
- Dirty, very dirty inside and out"}
{"text":"Kuni Sushi Ya ? Ya too much rice. They overstuff the rolls with rice, the fish is NOT fresh at all, maybe its the leftover from baldwin location? (which is alot better + they have a patio) the service is terrible, never have I had to ask 3-4 times for the server to come for my ginger ale. 

only thing keeping me from a 1 star is the 2 for 1 pop and they are open till 5am on the weekends. (who really cares about food quality when you can barely walk!, if you know what I mean!)"}
{"text":"I made an account just to write a review for this establishment. I've lived in Toronto all my life and have tried/been to various sushi restaurants.

I went with a couple of friends to this location. A couple of things that happened:

- The food (specifically sashimi combo) was not fresh at all. 

- There were multiple dead flies in the soy sauce bottles. When we notified the waitress about the dead flies floating in the soy sauce she kept repeating that they have been \"using the same soy sauce for three years\" and kept being defensive.

-The waitress was quite curt when taking our orders.

-When it came time to pay, my friend did not want to tip. When she realized the tip was automatically charged, she told the waitress she did not want to tip. The waitress proceeded to say that she lived on tips and that its \"in the contract to tip\" (what on earth?). In the end because the waitress did not let up my friend ended up tipping and leaving.

-One of my friends felt sick a few hours later.


One of the worst experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"The inside smells like piss but the food was alright. We got the lunch all you can eat and I enjoyed the service. The staff were friendly and checked on us every now and then"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this place 'Kuni Sushi Yuck' or 'Kuni Sushi Yack'. 

On the positive, it is a nice space to dine in. Inside, you can watch the television whilst eating. Or, if the weather is nice, the patio on Baldwin is amazing. The patio has often lured us here to try out this restaurant 'just one more time...it couldn't have been that bad'. They also have cheap drinks. 

However, the quality of food is pretty unappetizing. The rolls are small and mainly comprised of smushed rice. To be honest, I have felt ill after having eaten here a few times...to the point of barfing. Hence, the nickname mentioned above."}
{"text":"What a great place for a vegetarian who likes sushi :) (and I'm not the kind that eats seafood!)
I've been here a few times for the AYCE lunch. Can't go wrong for $13.99. There's lots to choose from and the ingredients used are fresh and delicious. Upon being seated we are usually served with cups of green tea. I really wish they would also serve water. 
The tempura vegetables are great. Not too much batter and not too oily. The edamame is always cooked well. Not undercooked and not too mushy. And always perfectly salted. I also usually order a couple of different veggie rolls but can't ever quite eat them all! Thank goodness for group lunches! But everyone knows, there's always room for ice cream!!! I LOVE the ginger ice cream. Order two!! 
Nothing really to complain about at this place. It's actually my favorite sushi place on Baldwin. The service is quick and efficient. The restaurant is clean and has updated furnishings. The only reason this place lost a star is because they serve the tea sporadically and unfortunately don't serve water unless asked. 
I'll be back soon. Save me a seat!"}
{"text":"As my rating indicates, I've experienced much better. To be fair, I've been to this location more than 4 times since its location was quite convenient and the prices are affordable. The food is decent and they haven't forgotten nearly as many items as Aji Sai which is nice. Their sashimi was thick and fresh and rolls are pretty good. 

The only issue I have about this place is that the service, on occasion, just was not up to par when it came to money. Firstly, they charged extra for an iced tea when 'ice tea' was literally on the same list of canned pop without indicating the difference or drawing it to our attention. Secondly, on a similar note, it was only until the last night I went there when it was finally drawn to my attention that tip was pre-calculated and reflected on the final bill amount. I didn't notice until after I already left my tip for the night so there was little that I could do at that point since I didn't want to make a scene... the waitress that night wasn't very friendly and I was certain she would be difficult. As I mentioned before, I've been to this location multiple times and I suppose I just trusted the calculations on my bill. They waitress has NEVER pointed out that tip was already included - I strongly believe places that do this should let customers know. I understand some places charge gratuity for large parties but every time I've been to this place I just ask for a table for 2. Without saying a word and collecting extra tip just seems sneaky and untrustworthy. For these reasons, I have avoided this place ever since. 

TLDR; Food is decent but service is questionable. They include tip in the final bill amount without telling customers. Look out for it IF you go."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the food was displayed really nicely.  The food tasted fantastic as well.  Very recommended. Atmosphere is absolutely fantastic and really easy to find as well.  Best one in the area for sure."}
{"text":"I came here after visiting The Ex per a friend, and I have to say that it wasn't as good as I expected it would be.  We came with a group of 5 adults and 3 children ordering off the AYCE menu.  The prices were competitive enough; I'd assume.  

There was only one waitress working, and she was constantly walking back and forth to service tables to the point where sweat was pouring down her face.  I felt really bad for her, so I got up and approached her a lot of times instead of calling her over.  This place really needs to hire more staff, as there was also only one chef working the sushi bar.  The food came out really slow, and a lot of dishes were missing...  then again this was my first AYCE sushi, so I don't know if this should be expected? 

The food was decent, the fish, especially the salmon did not seem as fresh as other sushi joints.  I found the Udon to be pretty good however.  

Honestly, I was greatly disappointed with my visit here, and I expected it to be a lot better.  The service was poor, and the food didn't make up for it either.  I don't really see anything that stood out or that would make this a memorable experience for me."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good in my opinion although it seems that a lot of people beg to differ. I really like their bento box! The maki that comes with it isn't your regular cucumber or salmon maki but really delicious dynamite rolls! Recently they changed their menu and you can get a few pieces of sashimi in place of the dynamite rolls. Their sashimi is pretty good as it seems fresher than a lot of the regular neighbourhood Japanese restaurants I've been to. I also really like their salad dressing more than most other places I've been to. I've had their AYCE and I agree that it isn't very worth it. Their ramen is also not recommended. Although the food is not mind blowing, overall this is better than many regular Japanese restaurants I've been to!"}
{"text":"Subpar is a generous review, but this place was full of disappointments. I came here on a whim with friends after the nearby ramen house was packed. I should have known better to check reviews before we entered. Ordered two kuni special bento boxes with spare ribs, which comes with salad, veggie tempura. The dynamite roll was okay, the spare ribs were luke warm and too chewy and the salad made me feel as if I was drinking the dressing. My friends and I agreed the best part of the meal was the hot tea, which they always kept topped up, hence two stars. Service wasn't sparse only because they kept asking if we were ready to order. You know how well a restaurant does by seeing them during peak hour. We were there on 10pm on a Friday night and besides our table were two others. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad for AYCE lunch for $13.99. Too bad lunch doesn't include sashimi which was what I was craving. However, $13.99 is a pretty good deal considering the chirashi don is $15.99. 

Let's see, what did I eat. Miso soup was a little on the salty side. Wakame salad was interesting - it had a peanut/sesame dressing drizzled on top. Sushi was fresh except the fish slices were too thin. The rice to fish ratio is like 5:1. 

Tempura was rather interesting. Having ordered both the taro tempura and salmon skin tempura, they both looked exactly the same. Small round disks. The salmon skin was wrapped around some small veggie bits (orange and green) which makes me wonder if these are prepared before hand and stored in fridge/freezer until use. Each tempura older was 2 disks. 

Dessert is your typical ice cream flavours - ginger, green tea, and mango. They also had banana tempura which was not worth ordering. You get 1/4 of a banana. 

Overall, it satisfies a sushi craving with ok quality."}
{"text":"Had a delivery from here and was dissapointing to say the least.

Almost impossible to communicate the address to the lady over the phone and even then they got our unit number wrong.

The delivery people came (in a pair) with no interact (So I assume they expect cash) which was something they could have asked for over the phone.

They also came with no change so their reasoning was \"Tip us more because we don't have change\"

60 $ meal with no soup, no salad for average sushi?

There are many other places that offer free delivery with purchases over 25$. Would not recommend ordering from here"}
{"text":"Please note, this review is terrifically under-inspired. So is this place.

I don't get sushi here. I did once and it was too expensive really inadequate. The \"annex\" sushi places have cheaper and better, which really says something  The only thing I get here is the soup. For Soup, its really not bad. You have a choice of broth and a choice of noodle. There are several options. Thats good. Its in the $6-8 range. 

Nice Patio to sit on when its warm. Bonus points for the traditional wooden spoons. Service is really lacking, and tea refills are not going to happen. Expect nothing but a seat on a decent patio, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Been here more than a couple times with friends and colleagues only for the AYCE menu since it is situated steps away from UofT St. George. Been going here since before their renovation, but wouldn't recommend to a friend who is from out of town. There are various other AYCE sushi places around that are much better than this and here is why:

food: 3.5/5 - It's your average sushi place with the exception of 2 items: the shichimi maki and their wasabi tako, more to follow later. So nothing here apart from the 2 aforementioned items particularly stand out. Their spicy salmon roll isn't spicy, their Philadelphia roll may have alittle too much cream cheese, their sushi pizzas are alittle overwhelming with rice.... hmm what else? Their sashimi is alright, salmon has a buttery texture as it should be, but the other sashimi pieces are average. Their much of the meat from their hot food menu is chewy, but will satisfy if you've come here starving. The ice cream is decent at the end, but really nothing special about the food they serve here other than the shichimi maki and their wasabi tako. Those 2 items stood out for me because they don't generally show up on other AYCE menus around town. These are the only two items I would recommend trying out if you do come here!

cost: 3.5/5 - You get what you paid for. It's not outrageously expensive, but it's not a \"great\" deal either. It's average price for an average AYCE meal.

service: 2/5 - OK now this review is getting interesting. Service here is terrible, especially during a busy time. For big groups beware, they say they will deliver your food to your half of the table, but when I ate there with a group of ~18, they had delivered all our food to one end of the table which did not make it to the other end without being fully consumed. I had complained 2 times about our food from our end of the table not being delivered and it was only until my 3rd complaint (and an hour from when we submitted our 4th repeated order) that we finally caught the ear of the manager who personally came to our table and told us that whatever we wanted would be made and come right away. A customer should never have to work that hard or wait that long to get food. I understand you are busy, I can see that for myself, but to have to wait 1-hour for my order to come through and sit watching everyone eat, you've practically tortured your customer at this point. I'd suggest coming with a small group or if coming with a large group work it out with the servers as to how the orders will be delivered. 

ambience: 4/5 - the renovations are nice and certainly open up the space better than it was before. It's not too noisy, and the TVs are a nice addition to watch between table conversation."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. Food doesn't come out too quickly. Having said that, I always come with a large group. 

The food is always very good and fresh. Lots of choices for the lunch menu and the prices are decent. 

Atmosphere is nice, lots of young people for lunch time. The decor is modern and elegant. 

I will definitely be here again :)"}
{"text":"Food: The dish that tasted good was the fried squid. The rolls were mediocre but did not taste as fresh.

Atmosphere & Service: The restaurant did not feel as welcoming. Service was appropriate.

Pricing: Decent for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here once for all you can eat and the menu and options were rather good except that there was no seaweed salad. Be forewarned that the sashimis are larger than at other all you can eat places.

The service was good and very casual.

I've also ordered delivery from here and the quality was reasonable and there was a good delivery time."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for AYCE with friends. I was actually quite surprised with the quality and variety. There are a number of special rolls you can order, beyond just the regular Red and Green Dragon rolls. 

You write your order on a piece of paper and the chefs fill it out, and in this case they were quite accurate. Many AYCE restaurants just leave out some parts of your order, or just give you whatever number of sashimi they feel is appropriate. 

For the AYCE patrons, they also offer a special deal $10 for 4 beers. While this is a spectacular deal, it is hard to take full advantage of it and still get your money's worth of sushi. 

Also if you pay with cash, you can get 10% off if you are student. All in all, not a bad experience. I would return."}
{"text":"Kuni Sushi Ya is a great place on Baldwin Street to have cheap all you can eat sushi for lunch. Although I haven't tried the dinner menu, I would definitely recommend it for an all you can eat sushi lunch in Toronto, as the food is pretty good and the price is very reasonable for all you can eat, at $14.00 per person. 

The service at the place is good and fast, and they provide both outdoors and indoor seating. In regards to the rolls themselves, I have had better spicy salmon rolls elsewhere (along with many of the fish rolls), however, they are still adequate and good for the price you are paying for all you can eat."}
{"text":"It's was ok.. Long day of travel.. Actually wanted to eat at the vegetarian spot across the street but they were closed 1 hr prior to the scheduled closing time.. It's descent Sushi.. Two of us ate for $50.. Very inexpensive"}
{"text":"Kuni is my first all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi experience in the core of Toronto.  My SO loves this place and highly recommended it.  For $20.99 dinner, it is the reasonable category.  The process to order is different from the other AYCE places I have been to; they give you a small piece of paper where you write what you want from the menu.  Not sure what would happen if you had illegible hand writing.

The food was descent, average - they have a good mix of hot and cold items as well as a variety of maki and sushi choices.  Their cuts of sashmi were very fresh.  Unfortunately, we ordered red snapper and it was not on our platter.  We had to remind the wait staff a couple of times of what we had ordered. 

I would return if I was famished but there are many other AYCE places in the downtown core to check out."}
{"text":"Love!, love, love this place! Not sure why others don't always agree. They just did a full Reno and the space looks great. Fish is super fresh and the Black Dragon is the best I've tasted anywhere. I've been coming here for several years and it has steadily improved. 

Server \"Ricky\" is extremely quick and we always ask for him when we come In. There is another location on Spadina, but I've always liked this one better. 

P.S. Samuel L Jackson eats here when he's in town!"}
{"text":"I went here in April 2010; this was my first and VERY LAST time eating here.

I am tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my husband and I both got sick after eating here.  While I was eating, it didn't taste that fresh and it wasn't sitting well in my stomach.  I actually ended up throwing it all up in the washroom while I was there.  The only reason I don't want to say that it was all their fault is because the rest of my dinner group didn't get nearly as sick as we did.

As for the service, let's just say that they took forever to bring out the second batch of tempura and the tempura was over-battered to begin with. So by the time it came, the tempura dipping sauce was cold and the tempura bits that had fallen into the sauce had made it clumpy.  We asked if we could get one more bowl of tempura sauce and the guy refused to get us new sauce.  He insisted that we use the old cold one.

It looks like other people had a good experience there; I'm glad they did not have the same experience as me.

If I didn't already love sushi, this experience definitely would have turned me off."}
{"text":"What is more painful than receiving 3 bites of your meal every 15 minutes? After the 45 minutes when they bring out a table full of food that's disgusting and then you have to suffer through swallowing or hiding every oily, fried, mayonnaisey morsel or pay $.50 a piece. 

I am normally a real fan of the group All You Can Eat sushi experience, enjoying the team gamble of how much delicious food we can fit in us without going too far and paying for what we don't eat, but this place is terrible. The service is crazy slow and food is icky. Worst we had were spring rolls - super oily and rancid tasting. Nothing seems fresh. Even the soy sauce had little flecks of ick in it. Everyone feeling sick. Bleggggggggghhhhhh"}
{"text":"The all you can eat for $18.99 is a pretty good deal if you feel like eating your face off.  I just happened to be of this disposition, and thus it came off.

Sushi was pretty good.  It got super busy right after we entered at about 8.  Nonetheless the service remained fairly quick.  
Dynamite and Rainbow rolls were great and the sashimi was very fresh.  Unfortunately however we found a bone in one of the tuna pieces.  I've never had that in my life.
Sushi pizza was definitely not the best I've ever had, but their tempura and miso soup were delicious.  Again, great deal for AYCE, but also well priced for individual rolls"}
{"text":"This is one of my preferred All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi restaurants in Toronto.  I have been a half-dozen times over the last few years.

For an AYCE sushi experience the fish and portion size is very reasonable.  The AYCE includes all sashimi, nigri and maki on the AYCE menu - so there is a chance to have a great variety of food.  The fish is fresh and cooked food is tasty (although I tend to stay with the sushi menu items).

The service has always been consistent - prompt and pleasant and for the price Kuni Sushi Ya is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"After finishing an examination, a few friends and I decided to stop by Kuni Ya for some dinner to end off a tiring night. Upon entering the restaurant it was evident that service was slow in comparison to the other restaurants along Baldwin St. Although not entirely vacant, the atmosphere was subpar (unless you prefer to dine in a more hushed venue). 

After waiting for several moments by the door, our waiter simply pointed to a table near the back and told us, \"You can go sit at the last table\". The food was then brought out very inconsistently as it took 10-15 minutes before the two other dishes finally came to our table. At this point, I felt bad that my friend waited for us and his miso ramen no longer looked appetizing. 

I ordered a Yaki Udon, which was nicely seasoned with an assortment of vegetables, egg and some pan fried pork slices. Tasty and satisfying for a dinner. Unfortunately, I could not finish my plate. Halfway through the meal I spotted a short, black strand of hair tangled in a piece of egg in the udon. Immediately, I remained calm and put down my cutlery as my appetite instantly vanished. I showed my friends and they also agreed that I shouldn't even try to finish it as they were also taken aback by this. 

My friend who ordered the ramen paid and we proceeded to go grab a bite elsewhere as this was a unpleasant way to end the night after a university midterm. 

For UofT students nearby and or other potential customers, the food is definitely not something to die for but it is also adequate if other restaurants are not as accessible (long waits, far distances etc). 

All I want to advise you from this review is to be conscious that the food may not be as hygienic as other restaurants. (You would think that a hairnet would maybe help prevent situations like this). 

Overall, 2/5 for a comfy seats and luminous ceilings. Otherwise, was not too fond of the occurrences from tonight and will not visit again anytime soon. 

(Maybe I'm too petty? I'm sure some of you don't mind a little hair in your food..)"}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of sushi but one afternoon while exploring the china town area I decided to give it a try - was the $12 lunch time buffet that got me thinking 'ooooh'

So the place is not massive they were not mega busy but busy enough for the two waitresses and two guys doing the cooking. 

I was given a seat and needed some clarification on what the buffet includes and how i should order but anyway long story short I love it, the variety of food on the buffet menu was great and I am no sushi expert but the presentation and tastes of the different rolls was amazing. 

They do serve you some sort of tea, which you will also get charged for but I think its a unlimited top up if you do have it for about $1.50 and it does go down nice with the sushi

Turns out that I was such a fan that I made my friends who were visiting last week also go there and try it out with the majority of having positive reviews.

The only bad point is that on the first occasion someone else's food was bought to my table but I advised the waitress, and the second time I went someone else's food was again bought to our table but because there was a few of us we did not realise and suspiciously ate it and it was only when we were getting ready to leave and the actual dish we did order arrived but we declined it as we were pretty stuffed. In hindsight the late dish did look great and i wish I did eat it just did not want to be the only pig putting my hand up.

Would definitely go here again I think for the good value, speed of service (odd minor hiccup between) and quality of food.

Unfamiliar with the china town area so maybe there are other places people can recommend so please do."}
{"text":"After two visits at this Japanese restaurant on Baldwin, I can definitely say I'll go visit other Japanese places in the area before going back.  The lunch hour is probably busier than dinner time, but AYCE doesn't start until later in the afternoon.  So, my first experience, I was starving and wanted to eat a lot, but didn't get a chance. Second time back, I was told the whole table has to do AYCE or none of you get it. That doesn't work for several of my friends- we had a pregnant woman and a non fish-eater amongst us. Plus, I just wasn't hungry enough to eat $19 worth.  
I enjoyed the food I had, but the ambiance just killed it. The Simpsons were on in the background and students laughing loudly, but no alcohol to temper my mood!  I found it looks like an old restaurant turned Manga with rainbow lights and funny cut-outs in the ceiling.  
Kind of funky, but I much prefer zen music and dark lighting to savour my sushi. 
Service was 2 stars, too. Lots of green tea, no water."}
{"text":"The same restaurant have a location on Spadina, which I have always enjoyed going to for the AYCE options and I enjoy their food. 

Here the food does not stand out as much. It is not terrible but its not great either. I usually go for the maki but these filled me up pretty quick due to the amount of rice used. 

They also did not bring out any ginger with the wasabi, which was a first. 

Their squid teriyaki stands out as a must try dish and the service here is really good."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat sushi with a big group of colleagues. It came out to around $30 per person but the service didn't justify that price. They didn't bring us a lot of the food we ordered, and also brought us extra items that we didn't order. I didn't like their dragon rolls as much as at other places."}
{"text":"When you're a starving student and the sushi cravings hit, Kuni Sushi has been pretty good at satisfying that craving. What's good about it is that:

1.  It's super close to UofT campus so you don't feel like you're wasting too much time trekking to a far away restaurant just to get your fix.
2. The price point for all you can eat isn't expensive either (~$17); so as a starving and BROKE student, you can afford to treat yourself. 
3. Hot food arrives hot to the table and cold food arrives cold. (this can sometimes be a struggle for AYCE restaurants)

What it has in terms of location and price point, it lacks in both service and quality of food. The service is hit or miss at Kuni Sushi. Sometimes, there's multiple servers out and your food comes out pretty fast. Other times, only one server is out and the service is so slow and you're stuck between trying to decide whether to re-order your food or continue waiting and hope for the best. I've been to Kuni Sushi enough times to know that there are restaurants that can do way better for the same price, but unfortunately, they don't have the prime location that Kuni Sushi does, so it really depends on what your priorities are. 

From my experience, they aren't too strict on leftover sushi, we've left a couple pieces behind and they didn't say anything. They also have a vegetarian sushi section on their lunch and dinner menus which make it really easy when trying to find food to eat (for any vegetarians). 

Overall, try Kuni Sushi if you're in the area, wouldn't go out of my way for it.

P.S. Fried banana on top of any ice cream is bomb. Make sure to get some before you leave!"}
{"text":"shitty service, subpar food, cashier tried to short change me. never again. avoid if you care about yourself."}
{"text":"Service was quick, the food was good. What else can you ask for an AYCE place. Place is big compared to restaurants in the area and it was modern and clean. Only drawback is writing your order on a sheet of paper."}
{"text":"Like others mentioned, there isn't really anything spectacular about this place.

The food isn't terrible, but also not outstanding. For lunch, they have a small selection of specials, which include miso soup and salad. We ordered the sashimi lunch, which included 6 pieces of sashimi and 6 salmon (or California rolls). We also had the kento box with teriyaki, dumplings and California rolls. Each meal was $9.99.

The chicken teriyaki was pretty bad. In fact, I'm not sure where the pieces came from on the chicken...it was chewy and tough, so it got put aside.

Service was very fast - obviously, not a lunch hot spot - and waiters kept close attention to our green tea/water refills.

Price point is a bit high when compared to others and nothing really spectacular stands out about Kuni sushi - maybe will have to try it again for patio seating in the summer."}
{"text":"We had a party of 4 sitting on Kuni Sushi Ya's patio for their all you can eat menu. We were chilling after my friend's product launch across the street, in plain view of about 20 people. Lots of people at the product launch were considering coming to join us. One person who is Black came by and was asking how the food was. We told them it was yummy and offered them a bite of our sushi pizza. The waiter suddenly came out to patio and at the top of his lungs began saying \"Hey! Are you planning on paying for that?! If you aren't paying you can't eat here!\" We explained that he wanted to taste it and we were already paying for our share. We were just giving him a taste. He wasn't sitting down and eating for free. He acted like this kind Black man who was just tasting our food, which we offered ourselves, was a criminal. The waiter was so loud that everyone across the street could hear him berate and humiliate this man. We confronted the waiter after our meal was done and told him he should be ashamed of  his racist behaviour. He shrugged it off and with a grin said \"Sure. I am sorry for my behaviour.\" I will NEVER RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Everyone is so picky.

Anyways, this is another one of the sushi restaurants that I often visit. We always have gotten the AYCE so I cannot comment on anything else. The sashimi pieces they bring are pretty small but you can order as many as you want so it doesn't really matter that much. The other appertizer type items are very good and the service has always been good. Nothing really to complain about with this place.

From what I understand, the rule of the entire table having the AYCE option is standard at many places so I don't understand that complaint at all. It's the same rule at buffets and for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"ALL YOU CAN EAT LUNCH.  For $13.99 they are just begging you to do all you can eat.  The other lunch specials are $7.99-$8.99 and lacking in diversity.  AYCE felt like a whole new world of sushi options.

Service was not wowing but they were pretty good about getting our food out on time.  Like some other people have said, things came out separately or one at a time BUT that was fine because we happily shared.  We were promptly given hot green tea upon arrival. 

I found the food quality to be good.  It wasn't mind blowing like what you get at a more experimental sushi restaurant but it was solid.  We left happy and full and threw on green tea ice cream at the end to sweeten the deal!

The one thing I would do if I were them would be to legit create order sheets.  Something about writing on post-it note style pieces of paper just makes the whole thing seem less awesome."}
{"text":"This is pretty average for an AYCE sushi place. I used to work nearby and came here a few times during lunch for AYCE. I also ate here for dinner all you can eat once. It's amazing how some places I've been to 5-10 times never screwed up my orders but Kuni has managed to screw something up every single time. Aside from that, nothing really stood out. 

Like most places, they don't have sashimi for lunch but that's fine with me. The sushi is average. There's slightly more rice than I'd like in their sushi. The tempura dishes are decent. I always like places that have fish eggs sushi. They have fried banana which is a nice touch. I really like how they have grilled octopus. It's one of my favourite dishes. Not every AYCE has this. 

With average food and average prices, I of course will give this an average score of 3 stars. It's not terrible but if you want AYCE sushi, this is not a terrible choice."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi I've had and not the best by far on Baldwin. For the prices they charge here(which is not that steep but there are better options in the vicinity for price), the food should definitely be better. Their AYCE menu did not seem varied, but then again I don't have a whole lot of experience on the AYCE front so maybe most places is like that?

Service was not friendly and they get your order and might check in on you once between your food arriving and you trying desperately to get their attention for the bill. For e.g. my lunch special was supposed to have either salad or soup, they failed to ask what I preferred and never brought up either option (I only found this out when I read their chalkboard on the way out). 

The food is not bad though apart from the price. It's good for groups (probably the best on Baldwin if you have a very large group of 15 - 20 people). 

I'd give it just under 3 stars as it's not completely horrible and far better than dirt cheap sushi. But the overall atmosphere does not do it for me. Better service and slightly cheaper menu options would do this place a whole lot of good!"}
{"text":"Went there with my gf for All you can eat 14$ deal!
Everything was good and I can recommend the place!!
White tuna sashimi was the best of all!!
Love that they charge for leftovers is left uneaten.
Good spot and will be back for lunch!
Place was slammed btw on a Friday lunch, that says smth as well!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend after his softball practice for AYCE dinner. He was starving so we decided to splurge here. It is $20.99 per person, a striking difference compared to lunch but it's expected. We sat out in the patio which was very spacious.

FOOD: Honestly we were very disappointed by the food. The sashimi especially was definitely not fresh. It tasted like leftovers from lunch or even the day before. The tuna was weird tasting and I noticed that in the spicy tuna rolls. Their wakame salad was interesting and different, and their udon was average. After ordering only one round we decided to leave.

DRINKS: They do offer pop for $1, I'm assuming with refills. We didn't order any other drinks, just water.

SERVICE: Their service was decent, nothing to complain about.

All in all, we were disappointed and a bit disgusted by the food. Leaving after only one round of AYCE is very rare for us and we both are big eaters. It was definitely not worth the money we forked out. We didn't even have the appetite for ice cream, and opted to go to Kekou Gelato for dessert instead. Maybe this place is better and fresher for lunch but I would not recommend coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a 5 star for ambiance... in the SUMMER.  They have a large patio facing lovely Baldwin Street.  The perfect place to nosh on some sushi and people watch.  Love that the mature trees offer some shade and beauty.

During the winter however when dining inside, you may as well be sitting in their walk-in freezer.  It's quite a large space so they must have given up on paying the heating bill.  Instead, you are forced to warm yourself on your mugs of hot tea.

But it's OK!!! .... cuz Samuel L Jackson approves of the joint!  Apparently he's been here and there's a pic of him.  I just love eating at celebrity endorsed establishments.

Beyond that, the cost of the AYCE dinner buffet is at par with most other sushi restaurants in the area.

Sometimes their salmon and white tuna sashimi is served with a frozen middle and cut either way too thick/cubish or too thin and small in size.  

The one item that I've seen them have on their AYCE menu that other places don't is their Tobiko (flying fish roe) SASHIMI.  The little orange roe specks are served generously on a slice a cucumber.  I ordered 25 pcs last time I was there.  Just for myself."}
{"text":"I was going to go to Kinton but my partner told me he wanted sushi instead so we went to Kuni. 

The menu is small and has basic sushi stuff, nothing really special. Other than that the sushi was pretty good and the price was really cheap ($22.99 I believe). 

Service was nice and fast and the reason why they're missing a star is the fact that you have to WRITE what you want to order. Not even those check sheets but it was a blank piece of paper and you have to literally write out what you want. The other star is missing from how small their menu is, not much sashimi and very few appetizers. 

If they had a more updated way of ordering, I'd come back. But for cheap basic sushi, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Ordered some quick take out from here tonight.  Some sashimi and a tuna roll.  Arriving home to eat, I open the box and am greeted by GREEN FISH.  Which, would be ok if it were CANDY, and not tuna sashimi.  I was horrified.  Tossed it on the trash, which is something this restaurant should have done when it went bad.  I feel sorry for all the students who are getting food poisoning tonight.  I narrowly escaped, unlike the poor souls dining in that restaurant tonight.  Never.  Again."}
{"text":"For all-you-can-eat sushi, this place is alright. But on the continuum of sushi restaurants, you could do much better elsewhere in the area. It's comparable to what you'd find in a supermarket: big rice chunks, fairly thin slices of fish, and a pretty unimaginative selection. 

Bottom line: if you need to stuff your gullet with questionable sushi for cheap without breaking the bank, look no further than Kuni Sushi. Just keep your expectations really, really low."}
{"text":"I've visited here twice. The first time was a couple of years ago during the summer. Great food and service back then. When I came in yesterday, I found myself disappointed at the quality of food now. Overall, everything looked like it was prepared in a haste. The quality of the food wasn't great either. The salmon on the salmon pizza had a slightly rancid taste to it and the kalbi beef looked as though someone chewed up some cooked beef and spat it out. Although the service was okay, it did not make up for the mediocre food that we had. There are definitely much better AYCE restaurants here in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here craving some sushi with friends after a fun day. We came in on a Saturday around 8:00, which gave us 2 hours before they closed at 10. 

When we arrived, we noticed that many of the 7~ tables of guests, which accounted for more than half of the guests there at the time, were on the patio. We thought that this was because everyone wants a chill experience outside, but we soon learned that it was because the interior was insanely hot, despite a large portion of the front being open.

The food was surprisingly decent in some cases (for AYCE, anyway). The salmon was decent and the cooked food was acceptable. Their cooked salmon and tempura however, were clearly overcooked and tasted like rubber. Notably, they have wasabi tako, which attracted me to this location, and it was pretty good.

The service was questionable, rude, and usually late. The waitress usually ignored our calls, and she took orders as well as dishes with an aggressive attitude. The store may be understaffed as well, as the food took a very long time to arrive. We only ordered small dishes of around 15 pieces sushi tops, taking around 25 minutes after giving in the order, and the restaurant was not even 50% full - what gives?

Now, usually I think this deserves a 2*, but what I am about to tell you truly shows that this place is shady and not to be trusted. When we received our bills (separate) for $25.98 total, two of my friends paid that amount plus tip. When the machine came to me, I noticed it said \"29.88 - OK?\". Absolutely not OK. I checked the bill, which clearly wrote 25.98 for each person, and asked why. She said \"the manager looks for a 15% tip\". Well, for one, we had four people, and nowhere were we told or did it say that a gratuity would be automatically added. Even if it did, why did my two friends not receive one before? Even then, I wasn't planning to tip anyway, as their service was slow and they managed to miss our order of 10 pieces of salmon sashimi anyway.

In conclusion: STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"These guys offer an all you can eat sushi, but I've never tried it.

This is a decent sushi place located on the popular restaurant strip of Baldwin St.  Kuni Sushi is clean, and the staff I interacted with was very friendly.  The food came quickly, and the sushi itself wasn't very bad.  I have a friend who always opts for one of the bento boxes here, but I've never tried it.  It looks good, though.

The only other thing to really make note of for this place is that Samuel L Jackson has been here.  He's signed the wall, and a photo of him with (whom I presume to be) the owner is prominently on display.  I mostly bring attention to this because I think it's cute and funny, but unless  you're the chemically imbalanced kind of obsessed with Sam Jackson, I wouldn't cite it as a reason to try this place out."}
{"text":"Good tasting sushi and high quality food overall, but the service was very lacking. The waitress lost our first order sheet, so we had to write it again. All of the fried food came in incredibly large portions, so it was difficult to try a variety of food. Pretty expensive and tip was included in the cost. Would recommend different AYCE sushi places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good cheap all you can eat sushi. Not the best, but you get what you pay for. Decent selection of items and a nice patio. I'd recommend if you need that cheap ayce fix."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch on the weekend. Decent price for decent food, and our server was lovely! It was a bit ratchet to write out our orders completely by hand but no big hahah. Beware that the apps are HUGE - we got some teriyaki and katsu and stuffs before our sushi came out and they were entre portions. We ended up being too full to finish the sushi so I got my first infamous \"uneaten\" sushi charge (50 cents per piece, for 8 pieces). Overall, very satisfied. Next time we'll definitely be more mindful of portions!"}
{"text":"I rarely go on yelp but after eating here, I was so repulsed that I downloaded the mobile app just to review it. I should have known by the musky smell when I walked in that this place was not going to be top notch. Out of caution,  I ordered the veggie bento. I got it to go, which may have contributed to the messy, lukewarm mishmash I received. The iceberg salads are never awesome at sushi places,  but the one I got was wilty and warm, and smothered beyond recognition in peanut sauce. The tofu was barely warm and came with a single carrot and one piece of broccoli, both also smothered in sauce. Then there was the tempura. It was all fine until I bit into a piece of \"veggie \" tempura that was actually an unidentifiable piece of pink flesh. This was no vegetable. Kind of looked like a piece of pepperoni or ham. I could not believe it! Absolutely disgusting. Glad at least I didn't opt for fish! Vegetarians and those who value their gastrointestinal health have been warned."}
{"text":"I usually refrain from posting negative reviews of places, but the service at Kuni Sushi was so slow that I had to make an account. In fact, I'm sitting here right now writing this review, after having been here with NO FOOD for half an hour. The restaurant was so severely understaffed (2 servers for a packed restaurant ) that we had to 1) seat ourselves, 2) ask for menus 3) ask for water, and 4) THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE US PLATES! Multiple tables that came in after us were served long before we got any food. Kuni Sushi Ya was a disappointing experience, and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"You can't get better for $20.99 (not including tax) for ACYE on weekends! 

There used to be two locations; one on spadina and dundas and the other in Baldwin village. The one on spadina closed down. The Kuni in Baldwin village has patio sitting, which is awesome. Their domestic beers are 4 for $10 if you get the ACYE. A steal!

The menu selection isn't as extensive as other ACYE, but it does the job. The rolls are pretty good. The sashimi is in line with other ACYE places. They even have spider maki for this price and a whole selection of veggie sushi and cooked foods.

The service is so so. It took awhile to get our sushi, but our hot foods came quickly. We thought they forgot our order, but it turned out that it just took very long. They give us blank papers to write our orders down. I liked this better than someone taking our order, but less than having a paper with items on it and we just check off what we like and the quantity. 

Credit cards are accepted.

Overall, a good place to get a sashimi/sushi craving satisfied at a decent price!"}

{"text":"They used to be good many years ago, but something changed, and the quality of their food dropped below mediocre. Avoid."}
{"text":"The best AYCE in Toronto and my personal favourite restaurant in the city. Family run by a man who I consider my adoptive Asian Father. I never leave unsatisfied; the spicy salmon nigiri is a stand-out favourite - as is the Samuel Jackson signature."}
{"text":"Yelp reminded me that I have had 5 check-ins here. Really?! I wouldn't say that it is the first place I think of when someone suggests sushi in the downtown area. But the convenience of it being located on Baldwin, close to the hospitals and UofT might explain why I've frequented the establishment. What can I say? Your usual run-of-the-mill AYCE milieu, with a good selection of a number of different rolls, sashimi and grilled items. I will say that the teriyaki squid gets +++ for flavour and cooking style, and so does the philly roll but that's just because I'll take cream cheese on anything. Nice environment inside and in the summer, the patio makes for a nice touch to enjoy the great outdoors. Will be back again, but only because it is 8pm on a Tuesday, my friends and I are starving and we are too lazy to walk far from UofT."}
{"text":"i've been here a few times and only because my one friend loves the AYCE here, which is decently priced.  i've left overly-stuffed every time.

the AYCE lacks red tuna sashimi on it, i guess their worried that it'll cost them too much in the end.  red tuna is one of my favs, i can understand them leaving off yellowtail, but red tuna?!?  their fish could definitely be fresher as well.

i've had much better rolled maki at other places.  most of the maki was loaded with mayonnaise, i'm not even sure if they're using actual japanese mayo or if it's just hellman's.  the physical rolls and presentation were bland and nothing special.

the wait staff can be good and bad.  i've had the same waiter a couple of times and he seems kind of air-headish and un-enthusiastic.  the other staff are fine.

eating on the patio can be a nice experience as you get to watch all the hip people walking by.  their men's washroom could use more regular cleaning, as i semi-gagged when i walked in.

you can get better japanese food at other places, the only redeeming quality of this place are their semi-lower prices and good location, but i'd rather pay a few extra bucks for an overall better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me start with how confusing this place was, it's pretty funny to have a Japanese restaurant in Chinatown. Ordering food here took a while because you actually have to write down what you'd like from their menu and I was hungry... I wrote a lot. I know for sure I did not get everything I ordered. 

I'm certain they were trying to cut my consumption down. When I asked to see what I ordered on the little piece of scrap paper. They told me they threw it out...   (-__-). Typically AYCE (All You Can Eat) places would give you the convenience of allowing you to select quickly from a made menu but this was obviously not the case here.

The service was honestly very lack lustre considering I was sitting very next to the sushi bar and there were about only another 3 tables with less than 10 people in the restaurant. I had to raise my voice to get the waitress attention which I didn't like to do. I like to keep the peace, keeping common courtesy in mind. I let the waitress know the other customer was calling for help also after she returned behind the sushi bar. 

This place wasn't the greatest I've honestly been to many better sushi places then this but I got my sushi craving fixed. I don't know if it was me eating too much or the quality of food gave me a serious stomach ache afterwards."}
{"text":"My go to AYCE sushi restaurant, they have raw octopus sushi (Wasabi Tako on the menu), what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap all you can eat sushi.  It has more options than kyoto house and servers better kitchen food.  Their yaki tori is amazing, sushi is alright; what you would expect at this price point.  Also 4 selections of ice cream is huge."}
{"text":"i was craving for some sushi and living in chinatown i dont have many choices, so i decided to try kuni sushi ya.

 i took a take out, as soon as i enter i can say that the service was meh, no hello, the waitress gave me the menu ''hurry up and decide''. The menu as various choices as a typical sushi restaurant.

i took some dragon sushi and gyozas which was i think really expensive for what i get. but i know that generally sushi are expensive and verdict: so muuccch rice in the sushi, they are tasteless and you cannot taste the fish and for the gyozas they were so oily, it was a pain to finish it!
well i don't think i will come back any soon, too expensive and not really good!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and I've been here about 4 times before and really liked their AYCE sushi at lunch time, $13.99 for the variety they have is great but they don't offer sashimi for lunch. 
I went a little late for lunch today around 2pm and it was clear the sushi was not fresh at all. They only brought half of the things we ordered and then said their kitchen was closed. i understood but would have amended my order if they had told me ahead of time. Most of the stuff we got was clearly old and heavily fried which did not set well for me. 
I actually threw up on the street an hour later, and no I didn't overdo it! The food definitely was to blame and is very disappointing considering I loved the place but needless to say i won't be eating sushi again for a very very long time.

I'm gonna give it 2 stars just because the service was good otherwise, and the place is clean and has a nice atmosphere (I have seen the place before they did the renovations and it is a huge improvement!)."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here occasionally for AYCE.. I really don't know what brings us back here. We are suckers for shrimp tempura, dynamite rolls, spicy salmon rolls, and sashimi. All those are pretty average here. Sushi and sashimi selection is limited for AYCE, a lot of rolls.. a lot of crappy rolls too. If you order a lot of shit like we do, expect not to get 1/2 your order. 

10% of you pay cash! Samuel L Jackson signed their wall.. LOL"}
{"text":"Patio is amazing, otherwise it's very poorly lit inside the building. Came here a total of 4 times so far. 

Some of the foods you would not be able to find anywhere else (ayce lunch) it's very refreshing and nice. But service is relatively weak and taste is very average. 

Come here if it's close otherwise just settle with anywhere else."}
{"text":"Kuni Sushi Ya

His place has been here for years they offer both a la carte and all you can eat. After reading the reviews on Yelp, I had reservations on eating here. But this place is well worth it for the price you pay. 
 
Location: Large seating area with a patio for the summer season. On street parking there is a private and green p parking near by. This area gets busy, with university of Toronto down the street. 3/5
 
Atmosphere: A university students go to place, so it does get a little loud. Specially when they come in large groups. They do have tv playing the games or the news. 4/5 stars
 
Service: Unlike most AYCE restaurants, they don't use tablets to place your order. Old school pen and pad, handwritten orders. They are pretty quick with service. No need to ask for water or tea when your cup is empty, they are just around the corner giving to fill it up. 4/5 stars
 
Food: Both AYCE and a la carte is priced well. Good quality fish is used here, unlike other sushi places. It doesn't smell fishy, you can tell they use fresh products. Try their specialty rolls! They have your typical rolls, sashimi and cooked Japanese dishes. If you don't know what to have, why no try a little bit of everything with their bento boxes. 4/5 

Price: Cheaper/comparable to other all you can eat sushi bars. The a la carte location is reasonably price. Rolls prices range from $5 and up. Free soup and salad with your meal. 4/5 stars
 
Overall: Great Sushi place. Affordable for students to enjoy some delicious sushi. Lots of room in the dining room. 4/5 stars

{"text":"I am currently sitting at this restaurant writing this review, as I wait for the food that I ordered for AYCE very impatiently. The dishes come one plate at a time, my family and I have been sitting for 2 hours and our order still haven't all come. It was busy when we first sat down so we patiently waited for our food since we didn't want to push them. But as time went on and customers got less and less, our food still came at the same slow rate. Had to complain multiple times before we even got some miso soups and salads. It turned out they lost our whole order. The AYCE system is based on hand written notes that we write, no printed order sheet to check food items off. 

Their food quality is not bad, and this is the only reason why I am not giving them a one star review. Service was not good, the waitresses avoided eye contact and did not seem to notice us just sitting and eagerly looking at them. Never came to refill our teas until we asked. Need new management. 

."}
{"text":"Great for students. Probably the best all you can eat you can get. However based on other reviews it seems that the quality can be inconsistent sometimes. So watch out for that although I personally have enjoyed it every time I was there."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a lower score I would. 

Me and a group of friends (6 in total) came here for the AYCE. We first ordered sashimi and everything else immediately. It took 25 min for the first thing to come out. and another 15 min until the rest of the items were delivered. They did not bring out the Sashimi or even our salads. So we had to reorder what was missed and took about another 20-30 min until our sashimi came. With that plate we only got about 1 third of what we actually ordered.  we then ordered more sashimi and rolls, where it again took about 30 min to get our rolls. They didn't even bother bringing out our sashimi again until we asked about it 3 times. Then we ordered just sashimi this time and the waitress told us that they were sold out of Salmon??????:S While we could clearly see the a large amount of the fish in the display case where the chef was cutting pieces for other tables.

Don't waste your time here, They're extremely cheap on their quality of food and portions, terrible service, and rude employees. Our dinner took all together over 3 hours because of the wait times and we left still hungry."}
{"text":"The worst \"all you can eat\" sushi place in downtown. Seriously. If I can give zero stars, I would. 

Service was horrible. After the waitress took our order, we didn't get our food for 45 minutes. We were playing chase with the waiter. If you want to eat here, make sure to put aside 3 hours or go home with an empty stomach. 

Food was even worse. Salad was stale. Miso soup was salty. Sushi had 70% rice ratio. 

Last note worth mentioning is that the owner of the restaurant was combing her hair in the kitchen area right next to the raw fish. If anyone's looking for a disappointment, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 friends. 

Inside was really hot, I recommend anyone coming to sit on the patio, which was unfortunately full when we arrived. 

Service was completely horrible, the waiter NEVER came to our table, and I had to bring our order up to the waiter EVERYTIME and he would scoff at me. 

The food was ok, nothing special, and a lot of items we ordered were missing even after we reminded them multiple times (which was no easy task as it seemed like he was actively avoiding us). 

Were charged a service charge was it was clearly obvious that if they allowed people to tip on their own, they would get nothing 9 times out of 10. 

Price is meh, 20.99$, I've paid less for better.

2/5 would not come again."}
{"text":"Yep, you guessed it - the All You Can Eat Sushi.

They've got a huge menu (at least compared to another AYCE sushi joint we hit up the next day) of sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, appetizers, noodle dishes, etc.

If you select the AYCE menu, you're given a few scraps of paper and pencils.  You write down what you want and the waiters come by continuously to pick up your order(s).

Everything on the menu is pretty great.  The sashimi pieces are very small, but after eating plate after plate, I was pretty thankful for the bite size salmon.  It was delicious - smooth as butter.  Skip the veggie tempura, it isn't anything to rave about.  Save room for green tea ice cream & banana tempura (it's literally \"one piece\" of banana - so order a few!).

Ignore any of the meat dishes.  Obviously you're not coming to a sushi joint to eat meat, but the guys I was with were pretty gung-ho about trying everything, and didn't leave a single item spared.  The ribs looked pretty sad, and apparently tasted as bad as they looked, so definitely stay away from those.

All-you-can-eaters beware: for every left over piece, you'll be charged 50 cents.... so only order what you can eat."}
{"text":"While it's a bit over priced, they have the art of AYCE down, especially for a large group. 

For about $20, you can have their \"sushi buffet\" which is a small-ish, two sided menu. They have your typical soups, salads, and some udon dishes (which are good!), as well as sushi, rolls, and sashimi. The fish is always fresh, which makes for great sashimi! 

What's best about this place though is how well they can organize the AYCE orders - they don't get confused about who ordered what! Their order system involves sheets of paper, but even in a large group they don't get them confused - even though multiple servers are bringing out the food. The only downside is that sometimes one group gets their food before the other - but since it's AYCE, you can just share and then order more!

Another big perk is their beer special with the sushi buffet - 4 bottles for $10! Can't go wrong. 

This place is definitely good for group AYCE - might be spending a bit more, but they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"The decor was decent but with the patio doors open it was warm AF here today on a sweltering July day. Plus they had CP24 blaring which was a real minus. The lunch specials run you $9.99 to $14.99. We did not do the all you can eat. The sushi I had was decent, but fairly basic and the rice was warm. Our server was okay but seemed too busy to care that much. The crusty oyster ladies eating the all you can eat sitting beside us kept bitching because our server dumped their orders without announcing what the dish are. I enjoyed that the most. All in all, it was a servicable lunch, but I won't likely go back."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for AYCE.
Menu is somewhat extensive and you get a good variety of Teriyaki, sashimi, maki, etc. The speed of the service varies based on how long you have been there and this was a problem for our group of 7! It seemed that the waiters did not want to bother with us after two or three orders and this was the disappointment of an otherwise above average AYCE sushi experience. 

If the service improves, this would be a choice get together spot on the otherwise tiny Baldwin"}
{"text":"Given that it's on Baldwin, a street full of restaurants, this would probably be at the bottom of my list of places to eat on that street. It was extremely quiet on a Wednesday night. Maybe 6 people other than my party dining the entire time we were there - and this isn't a small restaurant. One of my biggest complaints about AYCE Japanese places is how inconsistent their food delivery is and this one is no exception. The cooked stuff comes out at a reasonable pace, but the sushi took forever. Unless they were running out to buy it from the market right after we ordered it, I can't understand how it could have taken that long given that there were only 4 tables total to service! Of course you can't expect the best quality sushi from an AYCE, but even then this place manages to disappoint. Unless you really love AYCE and don't care about quality, I would steer clear of here."}
{"text":"AYCE Lunch sushi is $13.99 and they have some really good options!

The wakame salad is VERY good, tasty dressing!

Gyoza, generic but I love them...

Standard vegetable tempura.

Ordered a bunch of different types of sushi and all were quite good, especially dynamite rolls that were topped with salmon!

Everything was average and a definite cheap AYCE sushi spot when you've got a craving."}
{"text":"Good: decent sushi
Bad: Slightly higher prices compared to other sushi places around
Ugly: SLOW service. Expect to finish your meal in about 1.5 hours minimum."}
{"text":"My favourite All You Can Eat(AYCE)  Sushi :D 
The food is really good for AYCE. Unless they are packed busy, their service is really really fast. They have a lot of items on their lunch and dinner AYCE."}
{"text":"The food is terrible and the order they serve the food is also terrible. We got all the kitchen food before they start serving sushi and maki rolls.
Its a terrible place to go to"}
{"text":"As someone pointed out, the quality of food has gone down over the years. I went in 2014 and the food was excellent. Fast forward to mid 2016, the food became mediocre yet the prices are still the same I believe (note: the prices are similar to good sushi joints, which would be considered expensive with the quality the customers is getting). On top of that, I went to Kuni on different times - lunch, dinner, weekdays, weekends - and there are always 2 waiters only. Plus, the customers have to write down our orders (not even the tick boxes). From the looks of it, this place is cutting down the costs on the expense of food and service quality. The only reason I'm still eating here is due to proximity to my residence :/"}
{"text":"$20 All You Can Eat Sushi. 
This place was deliciously amazing. 
It was freezing so the restaurant was empty=Exceptional service. I was with a group of 6 friends and we ate and ate and ate! 

All the seafood was perfectly fresh, the sake was a little strong, but the miso soup, rolls, maki, tempura, everything was good. 
Clean bathrooms, just freezing cold. 

Great value, good time."}
{"text":"bad cooked meals. soft shell cra b was good but sashimi was frozen. overall this place sucks lol I'm harsh"}
{"text":"The Sushi is usually fresh. The service is good. The patio is great on a nice day. Ice cream and banana tempura for desert is excellent. It's a family owned business, but they can accommodate large parties as they have a very large venue."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed!! I took my dad and my uncle there when they visited Toronto since every single time we went there the food and service were good but OMG they really let me down! We arrived a Sunday afternoon around 4 pm, we got seated right away as the restaurant was almost empty and we wrote our order. We waited about 10 minutes for them to come take the order. We ordered drinks, water, tea and the food. They brought the beers right away for my dad and hubby but nothing else. 10 minutes later, no food, we asked again for water, tea and drinks (pop), 10 more minutes past, still no food or drinks. I get up to see if they can bring the salads and the water, tea, and drinks... we can wait but we needed something.  They bring the water and tea right away, we ordered pop again. Finally, they brought the salads and some of the dishes from the order. We ordered 6 of something so we could have 1 each, they brought 2 only. we were starving so we shared it and thought they were bringing the rest later.  in short, I ended up ordering 3 times, we were having the AYCE and yet the order never came complete. In fact we ordered noodles all 3 times and after a frustrating 2-hour visit we asked someone who seemed to be the owner if the noodles were going to come and she answered: Do you still want them? We said yes and she answered it would take 15 minutes to be ready! WTF, honestly! This was the first time I have seen this lady there, I think they changed owners because every single time we have been there, this young couple made sure that the service and the food are perfect! They even handled well a 22 people bday dinner we had there! I know is an AYCE restaurant and that the service is already expected not to be the best but they lost me as a client for now."}
{"text":"We ate at this place yesterday 9/16/2012 and had a terrific time. We were visiting from Chicago and didn't know anything about the place beforehand. All I can say is that we were pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by a very attentive waitress, seated and served rather quickly.  Our refil orders were taken at a quick pace and we never had to wait or look for the waitress, she seemed to be circling the room constantly refilling our cups with tea and water. Excellent service better than I can remember in a really long time. 

Now as far as food and specifically SASHIMI goes, because that is why I picked this place was very very FRESH.  The menu for the most part has all the classics miso soup seaweed salad, noodles rice dishes tempura selection a wide variety of specialty maki rolls and a large selection of vegetarian maki.  

The food tasted very very fresh and fresh fish seemed to have been placed on the table directly from the sea. Pieces of fish were reasonable with small portions of rice on sushi which is hard to find in chicago. Usually at AYCE buffets they serve you a big chunk of rice with  a very thin see through piece of fish. They do that to fill you up on rice which is cheap and not fresh fish which is rather expensive. Here at kuni sushi ya the opposite is true. Nice large chunks of fish with small bits of rice LOVED IT. 

The portions are on the small size but like I said they refill often and quickly.  Also watch out if you leave food on the plate, you will be charged for any leftovers."}
