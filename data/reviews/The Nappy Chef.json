{"text":"Placed an order over the phone. They confirmed  my order. I went to go pick it up and they said b/c I didn't give them my card info they didn't put the order in...ummm I'm not a mind reader that is something you tell the customer  B4 confirming  their order!!! And I couldn't order when I arrived b/c they said they were closed...HORRIBLE Customer Service"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken Mac was just ok. Nothing to rave about. Wasn't much \"jerk\".
The lady that answered the phone had a little attitude in her tone. In addition to that, i tried to call in the order and she said I would need a card to do that. I've NEVER heard of that policy anywhere. I was right down the street anyways so it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"i ordered the mac...sooo delicious!
order came quick. food was seasoned well. i definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Hubby found this on Yelp. It was a good choice. We loved it the food was excellent and the service was warm and friendly. We had wings, tacos and the Mac and cheese which was everything. I felt like I was at home with the atmosphere here. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I got wings and this salmon burger omg I was like I should've got a real burger until I took a bite out of it and my my goodness I was a full and happy camper afterwards and wanted another salmon burger. I will be returning. Wings was great too wish they was bigger but hey."}
{"text":"I'm back at The Nappy Chef restaurant because I heard they had chicken and waffles and I decided to give them a try and I must say it is a great Choice for brunch. The chicken was hot and fresh, and fried to perfection.... The Waffles were very soft, buttery, and packed with great vanilla flavoring all throughout. I seriously recommend everyone to try this it's a great choice and a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been stalking, well watching, him on Instagram and Facebook. I had friends come in town so I thought why not. I was disapointed that his catering menu was different than the store but the shrimp and grits were amazing. Looked beyond creamy and were elegantly placed midst this awesome sauce. They were customizable as they did include a pork sausage which you can have removed. The dish was heavenly."}
{"text":"I've visited Nappy chef several times and each time it was great ! The Honey BBQ  wings are sweet and cooked to perfection, The burgers and fries are banging and the jerk Mac is crazy!  I was greeted upon  reaching the counter and my food came out in a timely manner ! This is what the East Side was missing, I will be back regularly!"}
