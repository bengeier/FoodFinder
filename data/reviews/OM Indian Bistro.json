{"text":"Bought a cake for new year celebration. It was so expensive and not fresh. It was waste of Money. The service needs to improve. Food is ok, not bad."}
{"text":"It's a pure vegetarian restaurant with lot of items to eat at nominal price.  They are giving discount if we pay using cash.  Customer service also very good."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch box to go, OMG the food was sooooo delicious. This has got to be the best Indian food restaurant in Phoenix. They had two entrees, eggplant and kofta. Both of them were mind blowingly awesome. The rice wasn't plain rice either it was some type of veg biryani. Wow! It also came with naan, raita, small kuchumber and a gulab jamun. All that for $5.99! Mind blown!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pathetic place. Don't even plan to give a try.  I ordered a dosa, and all I received was half cooked batter. Also, it is impossible to deal with the morons standing at the counter.  You will be disappointed for sure."}
{"text":"Average at best - I have been going here for a year now as it is really close to my residence, it started with a bang, the food quality was good, the quantity was appropriate and there were some good weekly offers to lure the crowd in, BUT in past 3 months every visit has been going south at-least for me, the food quality is on decline, the portion size is shrinking, usual condiments served with the dishes have vanished - I know that the restaurant is trying to expand but the management should understand that the penny pinching route by compromising on the quality and service is going to bite it back. I am going to think twice now before going again and the sentiment is same among my circle. Somehow this has been the common trend with Indian restaurants in the valley, they start well then loose their sight and ultimately shut down and this may soon join the list if it doesn't get back on track..."}
{"text":"They will provide you variety of food but not the quality! I ordered for Pav Bhaji, Delhi Chaat & khasta Kachauri - all straight out of refrigerator and stale. They did not bother to heat the food before giving it to customer. And an extra pav (bread) was $3 which is way too expensive.  Not worth spending your time or money. Won't go back again!"}
{"text":"Something is wrong with the food! Most spicy food I ever had in my life. I was in there with my family and we all left the food & walked away! It's crazy! I would not recommend this place to anyone for Indian food."}
{"text":"Rip off roti. Good part of this restaurant for me is that this is s vegetarian only that I prefer. Also the set up is contemporary. Visited this place twice and had similar experience. All platers other than Undhiyo costs $4:99. Need to buy separate rotis for these that costs $1:99 for a very small roti, that is a rip off. You need 4 rotis at a minimum for an average eater like me that brings the price for one set of roti/curry to $13 + tax which is not worth. Also on both the visits, though I was fine, both my wife and children did complain about stomach upsets. Happened twice and that is something I will have to take it seriously"}
{"text":"Worst food ever!  This place is not even worthy of one star. Stale/Frozen/Tasteless food."}
{"text":"I ordered masala  dosa  dosa is excellent  but masala  was spoiled .how thay are maintained  thay food .bad management  thay have to check  the quality"}
{"text":"Very poor service, said they were too busy to even make us tea or take an order. Walked out unserved, there was only one other table. If you can't both fill a catering order and serve people, lock the door."}
{"text":"Place is cool but the taste of food isn't to my liking."}
{"text":"So apparently very mismanaged. Not enough staff to manage the order and prepare. The food quality is not as good and tasty as it was when new. Ordered jalebi, and it turned out to be stale."}
{"text":"Ordered dahi poori and bhel poori - both of them had stale chana, making them stale as well !! Masala dosa - was so okay !!"}
{"text":"Got the Weekend lunch thali ($9.99) which was probably the worst Indian thali I ever had.  No curries, two soups both were just boiled salt water."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a bad experience for us.We ordered Paneer Chilli ,Pav Bhaji and Jalebi.Nothing turned out nice.Pav bhaji was too spicy to eat.Paneer Chilli was hard and tasteless and Jalebi had some smell as if the oil was reused.We left the food as is and came back."}
{"text":"I can say the ambience is good but quality of food is very poor. I had visited twice and had Masala dosa,  paneer butter Masala and once their lunch box. On all times I was disappointed as either the item was too creamy or salt less. The rates are ok but at $10 for a dosa they can give definitely better quality.  I am sure slowly it will lose the initial response and fade away unless they improve the food quality."}
{"text":"Authetic indian food, wide choice of sweets, owner was helpful, definitely recommend coming here!  MR patel is amazing to serve the food himself being a owner and be a part of business. It crowded but he keep his patience and difuse the situation very nicely... amazing leadship and food quality"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed a lot of indian food, both home made and from neighborhood restaurants. I would rank this right up there with the best. Owner accommodated my request for a side of tamarind chutney as I am used to having it with my papadum. I ordered the lunch box to go which includes two Veggie curries (varies daily), raita, naan, daily dessert and rice. I felt the size was more than sufficient and the taste was on point. I can't wait to try her matar paneer and paneer tikka masala!"}
{"text":"Nice food , amazing Indian fast food , loved dosa and vada pav. I will visit it again to taste great fast Indian food"}
{"text":"I am not saying the food is bad but service is a important part of it. I ordered 2 dosa today . The website said that the 2 nd dosa is free on Tues and wed. Well the person on the phone says no I am wrong . And then after checking they have to change the website. So in short guys please don't have false advertisements. It reflects badly on the brand. Now I guess I will to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have Gujarati dish in the menu and trust me the taste is not even close to any Gujarati dish.  Namaste veg is 100 times better when it comes to veg food.  The quantity at OM is pretty less compared to the amount paid.  Since it's close to my place, I tried close to 20 items   So far from their menu thinking one of their dish will taste better. The only dish I liked is spicy dosa. Sambhar is disappointing."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this new restaurant in the neighborhood and ordered take away for dinner. Now we regret. WORST FOOD EVER! Ordered veg kothu parota, Hakka noodles and fried rice.  Kothu parota quantity was very less for the price and was not fresh. Looked like it was made out of frozen parotas. Fried rice looked like left over rice mixed with some sauce and carrot. Highlight was the Hakka noodles( !!) .  No GOOD words to describe what we got . None of the food was edible. Tasted so weird that we ended up thrashing them all.We ordered these as we know how delicious they taste back in India. We didn't expect it to be good like that but atleast it should show some justice to the name. I don't think we would ever go back there.  Wish Yelp had negative rating!!"}
{"text":"some dishes are really good. others are nowhere near real. Staff is arrogant. As soon as they see you tip, their behavior totally changes."}
{"text":"Just far too many items on the menu which makes them lose track on quality. This is the problem with most Indian restaurants in Phoenix. Dahi vada is probably less popular so the vadas were not cooked fully. It was doughy. Rest everything was just meh!"}
{"text":"Went to buy samosas today Not only I ordered way in advance by telephone they never would bring my food . They kept feeding everyone else . Just because I'm a white girl doesn't mean I should get bad service. I ask for my money back and they wanted my table #. Why hell need a table # for a take out item to get my money back and I'm not gonna stand three argue for $3.79 . So I left without food or money back. Going back to Tandoori Times tomarrow for paneer and vegi biryani and they treat me better and food is consistent and yummy ."}
{"text":"Worst ordering system and management, I ordered Thai Basil Fried rice and I got triple schezwan instead Of Thai basil, these happened second time with me. Either improve your service or stop serving the people"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite vegetarian restaurant in town but since last 3 times I had South Indian and Gujarati Thali and it was all disaster. What kind of vegetables they used! Pathetic ! I never had such weird subji in my life. Some standard subji they should provide in thali like spinach , garbanzo etc. I don't think I will ever go again now to this place."}
{"text":"Heard great things about their masala dosa and dahi puri and both things were awesome thought a bit on the pricy side. Taste wise food was great just one suggestion please wear gloves when preparing food and paan especially"}
{"text":"Will list out the pros and cons for this much overrated and expensive place: PROS: - Clean/Nice ambiance  - Variety of Dishes - Bakery/Ice Cream section - Location is convenient (probably why this place is running still) - I had their Chaat, Curries, and Dosa (Dosa and Chaat was good)  Neutral: - Staff is ok.  The person at the register didn't really seem to want to be there  CONS: - Prices are very high for the Phx area (and i'm from SF area) - Food quality is ok.  The Curries are mediocre and the Naan was not that great either (don't go there for their north Indian Cuisine) - there are many other places much better - They use paper/foam/plastic products. Way too much trash and considering their prices they should be able to afford real silverware/dishes/cups   I wouldn't go there again due to the prices and what you get for it.  There are many other better restaurants in the valley that are a nicer, with better food quality, sit down with real silverware and a more attentive staff."}
{"text":"Worst service on the front counter. Very rude and arrogant and they are not even responding to customer  for long time ."}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience and decor. Hopefully they'll maintain it. Pan flavoured ice cream was the best. Almost everything we ordered was pretty tasty. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"They make amazing curries like kofta curry and the paneer butter masala. Then naans are great and soft. Jeera rice was good and quantity was great for 3.5$!  Manchurian was lil sweet for my taste but one of the good ones I found here!  The South Indian and chat dishes are just average but do try the curries, value combos and appetizers! Will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered several items from the menu. It seems like they heat up the frozen food in microwave and served us. Everything except idli (maybe they ran out of frozen ldli!) looks stale and tasted very bad. On top of it ,the prices are not reasonable compare to other Indian chaat restaurant in the valley.  I felt like my hard earned dollars went straight into the drain. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"Been here couple of times now. Consistently good (vegetarian only) food - Rava Onion Masala Dosa, Paneer Tikka, Mattar Paneer, Veg Puff were our to-go orders. I even like the quantity - just right. Sneak Peek at the kitchen & it does look neat. Of course it's a brand new place so that is something I'll check back after a year. Above all I found the gentlemen extremely courteous and humble even to some really unhappy/angry/impatient customers. Good job guys! Hope the service continues this way & maybe, even better :)"}
{"text":"Not worth it, please don't go, this is my honest review  ***SMELL IT BEFORE YOU EAT***  We came and ordered South Indian thali, they gave spoiled subjee and  has bad smell, it's clearly smell like it's gone, but the reply from them this recipe is like that.  Another family also ordered and they also suspected but the reply is the same   They are not accepting their mistake and they are defending, this was the worst experience I had This is not that old OM"}
{"text":"Horrible stale food..... never ever going back again. Ordered a south-indian thali and a gujarati thali, every single item except the poori was stale"}
{"text":"We have been to om bistro a couple times since the opening. Everytime the quality of food has been degraded. Just a regular place with no food taste. It really upsets me that Indian restaurants can't maintain their standards."}
{"text":"We ordered Indian food from Om Bistro for our baby shower event. Food: Although we never eaten at this place before, on our friend's recommendation we ordered the food from here and I am not disappointed at all. We ordered chilli paneer, veg spring roll, kadhai paneer and jeera aloo. All the dishes were decently spiced and well prepared. The star of the event was Kadhai Paneer(many of our friends loved it), the spice level was outstanding and it tasted delicious. Spring Roll (were very soggy)and Jeera aloo (very blend, no taste)was a letdown though.  Pricing: Very decently priced and good for catering and events. Communication: I called them 15 days before the event and told them the order. They called me back 5 days before the event for confirmation. They even increased the order 2 hours before the delivery(I was impressed). Recommend: Definitely yes. They have a limited vegetarian curries for special events though)."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious south Indian and Gujrati food. Dosa and dhokla are their best. Good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty new which is a sister concern of Chennai Chettinad. Has lot many options to choose from. I ordered plain paratha and mini idli which tasted just OK. The paratha had oily smell and mini idli was too dry for my kid. So the taste is just OK and not that great.The food is served with small plastic plates which is not comfortable. The price is reasonable.  Would give it a second thought to visit again"}
{"text":"Please DO NOT expect a good meal here.  All the appetizers are way too oily. If you want to come here for lunch, please expect to wait at least one hour for your food. The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. We ordered to go and ended up waiting for an hour. When we went to ask what the delay was, we were told they forgot to write down the order. I ordered bisi bele bath to go and was given just half the quantity of what they usually serve. This is just a horrible place to eat in phoenix"}
{"text":"This being my second visit here I can pretty much conclude my experience here with 2 stars.  Let me start off with the positives.  The place has a really huge dining area with great Indian music and really courteous staff.  On my first visit here we ordered paneer puff(3/5) mushroom puff (3/5), pani puri-(what the heck?!?) and chole batura (decent). We weren't sure if we'd come back as the food did not knock our socks off(really good Indian food usually does) plus it's an all vegetarian restaurant.  My second visit here today was because I happened to be here in the area during the lunch hour. I decided to take the special lunch box which comprises of 2 curries, naan bread, rice, raita (yogurt) and a dessert.  Today they had palak dal and paneer masala, naan bread, raita, rice and gulab jamun.   I KID YOU NOT WHEN I SAY THE QUANTITY OF EACH WAS MUCH LESS THAN IF YOU WERE TO RECEIVE A SAMPLE OF EACH ITEM!    Did not even have enough gravy to finish my meal and I was still so hungry by the end of it I ended up ordering Hakka noodles and chilli gobi.  The Hakka noodles was mediocre at best, the chilli gobi tasted good though not really of the authentic chilli gobi. But it tasted pretty good.   The place has average vegetarian Indian food and may have more items on the menu which could be good, but I don't think I can stress enough about the quantity of food you receive for the prices. Especially the accompaniments. And when there are better Indian restaurants serving better food around. The lunch box is a total rip off, more like a snack box. This maybe my last visit here as neither the quantity can be justified nor the food is punch-you-in-the-face-fantastic."}
{"text":"The sorriest looking and tasting Dosa's in town. We ordered the Mysore masala and Mysore plain Dosas  on our visit last week. The dosas were so thin that you can't even taste the flavor and the the red paste that makes a Mysore dosa a Mysore dosa was virtually non existent! They skimp on the batter so much no wonder the dosa was so thin. We have tried their Punjabi food which is not bad, but the dosas were a big disappointment! On top of that we decided to have their ice cream which was another disappointment, clearly stale looking and dry.  Ambience = good combined with styrofoam cups Price= over priced Food= below average"}
{"text":"Was amazed at the service and care everyone gave me. Food was awesome too. Will be back with veggie wifey for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered chole bathura and dosa.everything is oily and taste is also not great.even we ordered some chocolate rolling ice cream which is also not good.will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"Overall good experience !! dahi puri and Chole bature were tasty . Veg manchurian was very sweet and non cooked.Dahi wada was ok ok if curd have been little bit sweet and cold  then It would tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I wish there was something less than a star to give and I would definitely give that to this place.I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Staff and the owner is very unprofessional.  They have no knowledge of what Customer Service is.  I will never dine in  or cater from them."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the staff was so rude.  Especially the guy taking orders - Chandrakanth .   Food was okay and not great.  Making food oily and spicy is their recipe to all dishes.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Had the aapam and iddiaapam both with the vegetable stew . Both were awesome. Quick service and the Mysore coffee was on the mark."}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IF YOU'RE NOT INDIAN. My mom and I just left the place. Guy asks us what can I get you, then talks to another customer instead and then talks to another employee and ignores us. So we walked out, and three employees weren't doing anything. They lost good tipping customers."}
{"text":"Stale paav bhaji bread. Didn't even have expiry date on the pack.  Soggy samosa and kachori.  I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"been a regular there - their preparation needs to be consistent; telling this since i was given a spoiled pav bhaji - however they immediately replaced it"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. price was also reasonable. I had Paneer and Naan, it was delicious. Place was also nice and clean. Food was served fresh and hot.  It did take a while to get my order. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"Well not sure wre to start .. Today i went out with my wife for snacks there and little i did no wat was awaiting me there.. We ordered chole bhature and dahi vada . Chole bhature was good but dahi vada was equally bad . Yogurt was tasting awful and vada had no taste. Notified the staff and he immediately asked for an item replacement. I intentionally avoided dahi items and went for the safe khasta kachori . And this was also a big dissapointment , the kachori was getting stuck to mouth and with NO expected crispiness at all .. And it is not at all near to traditional khasta kachuri we are aware of..Unfortunalely i took a tiramusu mousse for to go and it was also just ok , not worth the money.. However the ambience is good .."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the complaints are about this place. I was skeptical reading all the reviews. However, a co-worker highly recommended the place and my wife saw one of her favorite chat items on the menu, so I had to cave in and we decided to eat here. Their chat items are great. Customer support is certainly a hit or or miss. Our first visit the cashier was not at all helpful and didn't even smile. But he wasn't rude at all. We ordered for a desert to go during our meal. He was nice enough and suggesting holding in the cooler till we finished eating so that it stayed cool and fresh.   Our second visit had a different guy at the cash register. This guy was really cheerful, repeated the items on the thalis when I got confused. Answered all questions with a smile. Halfway through my meal I realized I didn't get a papad in my thali and I checked with him if it was included. He apologized and went back in. In a few minutes he called my name again and had the papad and extra Puris in the plate.   The dabeli is really good. I also enjoyed the South Indian thali, dahi vada and rasmalai. The falooda was a little too watery.  Service isn't the best. Yes, they call you one by one for every item you order and it's frustrating. But this is not new with eateries in India and even in the Bay area. So, I'm not sure what's the big deal people are making about it. The two times I was there the place wasn't so busy so I'm not sure if it gets worse when it's crowded.   I do agree $3 for  white rice when you're paying so much for a curry is rare but this is not the only place that charges you for the same."}
{"text":"-Excellent food. -This past Saturday was my first time at the restaurant and it is worthy of placing it on my regular \"take out\" list. -The other reviews were pretty mixed; however, we tried it based on a friend's reference and I am glad we did.  -Ambiance is Quick Serve Indian -Nice Interior -We chose take out but eating in would be fine.  The only negative would be room noise but it is similar to a Chipotle -The order was 100% correct -The portion size was large -Fresh and lighter tasting. Was not heavy like we have had at other Indian restaurants. -We asked for mild and it was a definite medium.  We will make sure to ask for Extra Mild next time :-)  -They have buy one get one and half off specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays  Yum."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. They had not problems with us asking questions and taking our time with the menus. The selection is huge! On top of all main course chooses, they have deserts on display that are gorgeous. You can even choose between egg and non egg made for those that don't eat them. There is an ice cream bar and more treats on the other side. The samosa were amazing! Plus the strawberry mouse was heavenly!!! The inside is clean and has bright colored paintings that could make this a really trendy place."}
{"text":"Price: high, most dishes are $9. Food for that price: Descent, some are dishes are below average. Ambience: good - good lighting and decor; fast casual type - order and wait for your table number to be called to pick up your food. Service: very poor. Went there on Sunday afternoon. Around 1 pm. Ordered 5 dishes and each came at different times several ins apart, last 2 were 15 mins apart. Desert came before food. Many folks were getting mad at the manager for same reason."}
{"text":"The quantity is very less and highly priced. Food quality is also very bad especially South Indian Thali & Gujarati Thali."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, best masala I have had in the valley and the dosai are incredible. The bakery is amazing.  Decore is cool.  Staff are friendly.  Prices are a little high but the quality makes it worth paying.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian street food kind eatery. It reminds me of eating taste food in India. Servers all kind of food including south indian, Gujarati and punjabi. I have eaten 4 time in 5 days. I highly recommend this eatery.  Must try your self."}
{"text":"Hi I would like to share my experience Last week I had my son's birthday party here in restaurant  It was awesome experience  More than 35+ guests came and very one was very happy  Satisfying 35+ people in one floor is big task but this guys did it We had 7 items in the menu that too in the biggest tray size. All food was empty  Highlights of menu is Mutter paneer, Mango Kulfi, veg Manchurian and spring roll I need to tell about cake Oh my goodness, it was so delicious  We made 2 theme cake with Indian flavor, we personally feel like the cake was brought from India it was that much taste Overall the party gives us the feel that we had function in India  I have more to talk about but I think this is good enough  I recommend everyone to taste and experience by yourself Pls don't bang on with my or others taste and experience"}
{"text":"I like the thali on the weekend. They have a very good choice of food, sweets and cake."}
{"text":"Best place dosai. Service was great and cleanest Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Will definitely be back!  Sambarwas a tad oily."}
{"text":"Bunch of cheats. Went there Sunday evening and ordered a couple of items upto 15$. After reaching home realized that at the store they forgot to include one of the items I had ordered for. Will never go back here again and neither to their sister property Chettinaad something. A real bunch of Indian cheats. Being Indian myself I feel he just tried to rip me off and succeeded. Do I need to open the packet and check everything that I ordered? Bunch of scoundrels."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place with excellent food. The taste of the food is as close as it can get  to the food in India.  A lot of places in the states - who carry Indian food - are not anywhere close to what the actual dish taste like. This place is NOT one of them. Some of the things we tried here are - veg cutlet, dosa, rava dosa, Hakka noodles, paneer tikka masala, naan and papdums. All these were simply delicious. The only thing I didn't like was gobi manchurian. They made this way too sweet. (For those who don't know- gobi manchurian is an Indian Chinese dish - cauliflower florets are dipped in a flour batter, then deep fried, and then stir fried with onion, green chilies, lots of garlic, sauce soy and more, while still keeping the crunch of the florets intact)  The ambience is casual and welcoming. The place is well lit with white lighting (yellow lighting changes the color of the food we see)   Here you need to self serve - we place the order at the counter, pay and then collect the food when called out. This sometimes seems troublesome, if one has ordered many dishes and needs to go every now n then to collect the food.  Also if you need to order more, you need to go back to the counter - if there is a line - tough luck ! Regardless of the above troubles - the food being  amazing,  I would definately give a big thumbs up to this place.  I have not tried however - They also serve custom cakes, pastries, desserts etc"}
{"text":"Last time I ordered simple masala papad and they give me the papad with all frozen onion,tomato and cilantro ,so you can imagine how much fresh food these stupids are serving."}
{"text":"I tired papdi no lot and sev usual! Papdi no lot was awesome, reminded me of my hometown in India! Definitely going back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"These place has the biggest menu choice I seen on Indian food .Everything I had was good going back fur sure with friends ."}
{"text":"When this restaurant opened near my house, I was so excited. I frequent a few of the Indian restaurants nearby, and I was pretty thrilled for one in walking distance. Sadly, I'm going to keep driving further away.   1. The food just isn't very fresh-tasting, and the portions are tiny (for the same price) in comparison with their nearby competitors.  2. They have a huge menu of bizarre choices that combine Italian, Mexican, and Indian flavored for no discernible reason. I don't want Mexican cheese and Chinese noodles in my dosai.  3. Service is very slow.   I love that the restaurant is close by, but it's not good enough to bother coming back."}
{"text":"It's way to spicy even for mild. I've gone twice and it's way to hot. I could not eat mild curry and I've got ten years experience with Indian food and I would like it if it wasn't so hot. Rose lassi is good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is not that great inside so we don't like to eat in, but luckily we live across the street so we can eat in the comfort of our own home. The curry options are pretty good, the veg samosas are good as well, as is the garlic naan. The main issue is that the food is made at one heat level (mouth burning but not unbearable). They ask you for a heat preference but mild is the same as hot. We ordered a dish and specified it was for a kid and even after the cashier made a  note the dish still came out spicy. I am not a wimp when it comes to heat either, but it will make you sweat for sure.  It just makes me think they are not cooking fresh but in bulk."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for such a restaurant in Phoenix area. After passing by several times, I finally went inside this time. I was amazed to see the ambient inside. They have huge space for dining. Being a vegetarian, I believe that they have the best and longest menu than any other restaurant in town. A quick lunch costed me about $6 that was incredibly tasty and nutritious at such a price. Above all, they have a wide variety of ready to pick fresh Indian snack and sweets item that were never available in shops.  I will be updating my review after visiting there several times. Definitely recommending to try, you would love it!!"}
{"text":"So I love dining out and would love eating outside almost at most of the places. Sometimes the thing I don't like about some of the Indian restaurants(and I'm not generalizing anything here) is that they just take it for granted that Indians will visit a restaurant like this and it does affect in a way how they provide service thereby.   I was told that they can't split the bill as there are a lot of people waiting in the queue. I mean, what? Ofcourse I didn't act right then but didn't feel happy at all. The food overall was okay there are a lot of factors which determine a restaurant's quality."}
{"text":"Short version: pathetic service, pathetic ambiance, value for money is okay and taste is good. Overall a negative experience. My suggestion, get takeouts. Never make the mistake of dining in.  Long version: There are no suppliers. They give out table numbers and announce the orders over a mic (like a karaoke mic). The mike often picks up static and ends any possible ongoing conversation. Once your table is called over the mic ( which could be multiple times depending on your order) and you have to clumsily walk through a line of waiting people and pick up your food, to be called back again in 2 minutes.  The quantity of food is pretty bad. For a masala dosa they gave me about 20ml chutney ( I wish I was kidding). When you ask any staff for a refill, they curtly point you to the same pickup area, to go ask the staff there. As if asking them for a refill is a blunder and providing service to you is repulsive to them.   The food itself is not bad. It is in fact better than most if the Indian restaurants I've tried in Phoenix.  Advice: Never dine in. Get take out."}
{"text":"Good Indian food, very polite reception. We ordered a masala dosa, pav-bhaji and a bombay sandwich. Everything was good and had the correct spice level. The pav-bhaji was a bit bland, but it was fresh and tasted good. Also, they sell freshly baked pav breads for $1.99 (6 in 1 loaf) which I think is a pretty good deal considering they make it fresh once you order. All in all, a good place for fast-food and chats."}
{"text":"Service was okay for a Sunday night. It got really busy toward 8pm. The mango lassi was awesome 4.5/5 ( not too sweet nor too sour) just perfect   Amongst other snacks we orders :pav bhaji ( I believe?) 1/5 NO TASTE , I can make this at home with a better and finger licking taste !!  Pani puri has this tamarind and cilantro paste taste to it and I hadn't taste it anywhere else so this was new for me for me , so it is a 5/5  Chai  5/5 as well!  Your pav bhaji lacked taste and we expected much more taste"}
{"text":"Bad worst. Gave spoiled tomato chutney for dosa. Never go this place. Earlier gave spoiled sambar. Worst service"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends who recommended OM, they loved it but I was skeptical after reading a few negative reviews.  I learned a valuable lesson-reviews are subjective and may not tell the whole story, well except mine of course tee hee.  Well all be told, I was pleasantly surprised and apologize for my snootiness.    The good:  ~The spice level was on par with authentic Indian food, hot but not to the level that the flavors were masked. ~CLEAN!!! Nice bright space, very casual order at counter and pick up when they call your number. We sat for a couple of hours eating and chatting very comfortably and undisturbed. ~Staff were all pleasant and very helpful. ~Starters were tasty. We sampled Veg and Paneer Pakora's and the Quesadilla, thats right, I said Quesadilla and I am still reviewing and Indian joint!  Eastern spin on the cheesy south of the border staple, well done fusion. ~Masala Chai was temperature hot the way it's supposed to be and the masala spices are a nice blend with an emphasis on cardamom - a personal fave. ~Jalebi is really the only Indian sweet for me which I must confess I often crave.  OM makes one of the best I have tried in the valley.  The medium:   ~Aloo Gobi Curry was not what I am used to being a first generation American child of Delhi Dwellers and Pahari's. I am assuming this is a South Indian version?  Not sure but it was just OK.  ~not a fan of the popular Dosa so I will refrain from opinionating on OM's version yet our friends really love them.  I must say they are very large, fed our party of four sufficiently.  No Bad!  Very solid establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible food, avoid this place if you have an option.  Ordered a special thali on Diwali day and all the items are so terrible."}
{"text":"Very good food , very delicious,  very clean , the best Indian food so far , great job , keep going"}
{"text":"Please train your staff to talk politely to customers. We are paying for our food, you are not giving it for free!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I really did. But sadly I highly disliked them.  The place is cute but not very inviting. Whatever I can get over that. The guy who took my order barely even talked to me. I wonder what he was so miserable about...anyway I ordered 2 orders of chana masala. I asked if it came with rice or naan and it didn't so I had to get that separately. Not to mention, the Chana masala was $10 bucks already by itself. A little pricey if you ask me.  I asked for low spice..mild. I am not a big fan of spicy and neither is my stomach. My total was a little less than $30. Again, that's a little much for my dish. If it was meat it would make more sense. I went ahead and paid and I remembered that I wanted somosas after the fact I paid. So I went back up the guy and ordered them separately and he looked at me like I just peed in his Cheerios.  Now for the best part...there is none. The Chana masala  was inedible. It was too spicy. WAY TOO Spicy. My friend and her mom love spicy food and they couldn't even eat it. The flavor would have been good but you couldn't taste much because  your mouth was on fire. Same thing for the somosas. Those weren't that great and they were way too spicy. We ended up eating just the rice.   Won't be back here. No siree bob."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We had 3 orders and did not receive one. Waited over an hour and still did not receive our third order after asking the employee several times about it and being told \"they will check it out\". The food did not taste that great either. We highly recommend Chennai Chettinaad Palace not too far just off of Bell and the I-17."}
{"text":"The Dabeli was tasty. Spicy. Service was the only downer. So many options a little help for the uninitiated would be good."}
{"text":"More than what I had expected, place is very clean and it's a pure vegetarian restaurant... Loved the place, will be coming frequently from now on...."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit too high for what they are offering. Let's be clear, the flavors were pretty good for a vegetable curry. What wasn't good was the service. Eating food from some of the most depressing looking and acting people takes a lot of effort. I felt like I should have been paid instead. My only solace was when a woman emerged from the kitchen and smiled at me. Deep down I hoped she made my food, because the front of the house service was bland and soulless. If they are going to continue with that kind of service, they need to lower their prices dramatically."}
{"text":"Food is very very(everything) sweet..not tasty..no proper response from the staff..not recommended.."}
{"text":"Practically hostile service, and plates are tiny for the expense. Sit-down restaurant prices, but disagreeable fast-food atmosphere with a large but confusing, all-vegetarian menu. And they yelled at us for not bussing our own table!"}
{"text":"Being Indian I love to try out local Indian restaurants.  I just moved to Arizona.  OM Indian Bistro is located very close to my work.  I saw it one day and decided to walk in a take a look on my weekday lunch break.  The restaurant offers a vegan an vegetarian menu.  Being a vegetarian, I prefer eating at establishments that do not cook meat products.  OM is a casual place.  The seating wasn't fancy, but it was neat and clean. Their desserts are all displayed at the counter.  They have eggless cakes and also have options without onion and garlic, which is great to know.  My grandmother does not eat onion and garlic. I tried the lunch special of masala dosa.  Service was quick.  You order, take your number and they call it out when ready.  The guy taking the order was patient and polite.  Water cooler is available for water.  The masala dosa was great.  For $5.99, it hit the spot.  Came with masala dosa, sambhar, chutney and dessert.  I expected a lot less, but got more.  Always a plus.  I've got back a few times and had the same dish.  Consistency has been great; different desserts were included each time.  I have subsequently eaten there with my family.  They have tried out the lunch thali, bhel puri and samosa.  They were happy.  The paneer dish in the thali was ok, but definately not what you eat if you are craving punjabi dishes.  I will go back to eat here again.  I am hoping that they do not reduce their quantities or increase their prices, as restaurants tend to do after they become busy and famous.  They have a really really big menu.  This always concerns me because no restaurant can make so many dishes without preparing gravies and partially cooking beforehand.  I recommend this place for quick lunches, street food and taste satisfaction.   Something there for everyone!"}
{"text":"This review is ONLY based on Dosa that I had. I have been in the valley for close to eight years now and have not seen a restaurant that can serve a good Dosa. Have been to udupi cafe, woodlands, Chennai fusion. Although these restaurant s have south Indian names they do not have a good south Indian item. They have good Dosa but the sambar and chutney are the one where every body lose their credibility as an authentic south Indian place.  Here I was not disappointed. I ordered ghee roast masala Dosa and it was very good. Sambar was awesome, chutney was awesome. I literally emptied the whole sambar. Some people have complained about the quantity. That is true but you can always ask for a refill. I am pretty confident that their other Dosa s will also be good as well."}
{"text":"I loved the cup cake and pineapple pastry super yum. Dahi sev poori is a must try. I was surprised to find undhiyo poori which is a Gujrati speciality my husband loved it. It was crowded but it felt like India ( home away from home ) will definitely recommend to my friends    Veg puff for 1.99$ is a great snack with chai"}
{"text":"I have been visiting Om for the last 18 months. I used to frequent this place pretty often as it was one of favs for tasty Indian food.. but in the past 3-4 months, I have seen it's quality dropping down significantly! Not to mention, I have tried a range of things and that too on different days - busy days, not so busy days, rush hour, blaah blaah  Couple of months back, I ordered Gujarathi Thali, and I told myself may be they do everything else better and aren't really good with Thali's  Last month, it was a Punjabi veg curry - it was super hot and oily - even for my Indian taste buds.  Last week, I ordered Dosas and Pani Puri. Dosas were decent and I regretted ordering Pani Puri. Guess they took the word \"Pani\" too seriously and it was literally Pani (meaning Water). Yes, it was just mint flavored water - may be some chutney leftover mixed with water and served. I didn't go an complain as it was their dosa day and dosa was still good..so I just regretted buying Pani Puri and decided to never order it again.  Yesterday, when I went there, I simply ordered a Dosa. The white coconut chutney was pretty stale and had slightly rancid odor - it's so not what Om used to be like..and perhaps this was the last time went there.  Note to the owner: I hope you take feedback seriously and make some serious improvements! This is a common sentiment that I have come across lately."}
{"text":"Amazing vada pav, kachori and chaat :) I will come back sure to taste other things as well."}
{"text":"Great place for good vegetarian Indian food. Good place to have some chaats in the evening along with some chai."}
{"text":"they should rename the restaurant as \"OM FROZEN Indian Bistro\"...all the appetizers are straight out of the freezer and taste really bad!!! n they don't have to charge me so much for frozen food...I can find it myself in a Indian grocery store for half the price....even their Veg curries taste stale...This place is surviving  only because this is the only Indian restaurant in the nearby area and it's proximity to Big offices and apartment communities....Avoid and go somewhere else if u can drive a few miles....  The cherry on the cake goes to the rude unattentive staff...they don't care customer complaints n feedback...  My review is based on multiple visits to this place and every time I had the same experience...I should have taken yelp reviews seriously!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Veggie samosas were good. Also got the palak paneer which was so processed it was like eating soup. Wish they wouldn't blend the spinach so much. It was like a thick smoothie. The Chana masala was good but I asked for mild spice which there was NO WAY that was mild. I couldn't take more than a few bites bc it so spicy which is too bad bc it was actually really good. Also I didn't like that for the price of a small container of veggie curry, none of it comes with rice. They sell separate containers of rice for eight dollars! Eight dollars for a bowl of plain white rice? That's crazy! I have never been to an Indian restaurant that doesn't serve rice with their curry. The fact that you have to pay separately for a bowl of rice almost the same cost as the dish itself is a huge turn off. For that reason alone I probably would not consider coming back to this restaurant. Which is too bad because some of the stuff I tried was actually pretty tasty. But there's a ton of Indian restaurants close by that are just as good if not better. And their curry actually comes with rice! Almost $20 for a container of curry and a bowl of rice? You can go to other restaurants and get both for the same price!"}
