{"text":"Definitely a local's place.  Unlike pretty much every other bar in Kent, you probably won't find a single KSU student here.  The crowd is very diverse in age and in personality.  This seems to be the place the Kent locals come to unwind in peace.

Prices are fairly cheap, depending on what you order.  Two Great Lakes Christmas Ales and one Vodka Tonic ran us $1.

The staff members were super friendly.  As far as I know, they only employ two female bartenders, both of whom are quite attentive.  Even on a fairly busy night, there was never much of a wait for a drink.

They run happy hour Mon-Sat 4:00-7:00 with $2.25 well drinks and 75 cents off al beers.  They also have a limited food menu.

They have karaoke Thursday through Saturday, so it can get quite noisy."}
{"text":"Great dance area. You can make this place yours to sing dance or visit at back table. Not gonna wait long for food or drinks. Never had to push through a crowd waiting for service. It's a big open area long bar. I've been there maybe once a month for awhile when in the area from my travels and Tom always has a great variety of IPA's. Menu looks good I've always had the wings that are great."}
{"text":"Best karaoke in town. Great dive bar atmosphere, but no dive bar filth. Despite being located in Kent, it's definitely not like a college bar, most people are older. Staff is friendly, prices are great."}
