{"text":"Best gyros in Phoenix period. The hummus is really good, too.  I love greek food and these are the best gyros out here.  The pitas and the meat are the best I've tasted out here.  Some places give you the preccoked presliced no tasting meat, and others load their sandwiches with tons of lettuce and tomatoes with no meat.  This place piles on the meat.  Special note: If the wife makes your gyro be prepared for biggest meat gyro you've ever seen, but the husband makes a better gyro giving you a better balance of meat and toppings.  
Unfortunately, I can't review the rest of their meals because I can't get past ordering the perfect gyro.  If it's not broke, don't fix it."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places where food is good, owner who works the kitchen and they know what is good food. Olympic Gyros is one of those spots that i make sure to stop by once or twice every week for lunch. Few places where you can have a full meal for under $10. 

Tonight I was working late so went their during closing time and Steve the owner was cooking. He is a Chicago native who knows about food and we ended up talking a lot about food in phoenix, small business, what is good food etc etc.

PS: They have also introduced chicken wings so try them."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Gyros and Yelp reminded me of this place just down the street. This place didn't disappoint! HUGE portions, delish food, (especially the pita), and super friendly people. Will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"Steve is a great guy but the gyros and fries fall short of OK let alone great.  First off the gyros always sliced so thin that it quickly burns and curls on spit when cut. That Would put you out of business in Chicago. Next the toppings are weak and need to be improved. The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.  I wish I could have a gyros like central gyros or costas gyros back home. Your sauce is good but that's just not enough to earn more stars.  I will submit this to the AZ papers as well maybe just selling the business would be best.  The gyros here should be free.  Come Steve better gyros for all is needed.  I mean dry and burnt just doesn't work man. I will be watching this place and informing others if things improve.  Peace."}
{"text":"Friendly service, and consistently good food. This is a small little Gyro place next to a liquor store that you'll miss if you blink.

If it was a bar it would be a dive. Could the inside use some painting, and the floors a good steam cleaning? Sure, those things are definitely needed, but the kitchen area looks clean to me. I always get my food to go anyway, so I'm OK with it. The service is always friendly here. They make your food to order, and it is really good. They have no problem with special requests either. Hooray for flexibility! I've had the Gyro sandwich, and the rice here. Both were great.

The other day on my way out an older man in front of the liquor store asked how my service was. I assume he owns both the businesses? Anyway, it is nice to be asked about service in a tiny, independent business. I was happy to tell him the service was great, as usual."}
{"text":"They raised the price of the gyro up almost a buck.  It wasnt that great to begin with.  The pita bread is nothing special and the toppings are often non exsistent.  If you are craving a gyro drive a couple blocks east to Z's Greek or Chicago Gyros.  They are much better and actually put massive amounts of toppings on it unlike this spot.  Not only do they fill the gyros with more toppings that taste like better quality but they provide better service and have a better atmosphere.  For example, Z's has a flat screen with ESPN on and more tables.  The fries also taste better and have seasoning on them.  He also comes by and checks on you and provides that personal service most places dont.  At Chicago Gyros they also have a nice flat screen and a well decorated interior.  The reason for my comparison of these three restaurants is because they are in pretty close vicinity and offer the same product.  The other two shops just do it better.  Thats the reason for the two star review.  Meh...I've experienced better and its only right down the street."}
{"text":"oh my, these are huge gyros.  somewhat scary looking at first.  not pressed in their cellar but good enough to find on a food cart in nyc.  simply can not beat the value if you are hungry for lunch.  they do need some greek coffee though.

with all the i heart chicago wallpaper, you'd think they would have a plasma TV with my big fat greek wedding on repeat play,"}
{"text":"I think the owners changed..  The price is kind of high now and the gyro is not as good it seems.  Not enough sauce maybe?  The fries are ok, but the seasoning is not very even.  They have a frequent flyer's card - I think if you buy 10, you get 1 free.  Maybe I'll check in on them again because I think the husband and wife team was just starting out when I went."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros! Big portions. I definitely recommend Olympic if you like Gyros!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Gyro in Phoenix. Customer service is always great and the people that own it are super nice. The meat is piled high and its nice and thick and a little crispy. Perfect! Only downside is parking is a little bit of a pain and the 7 pm closing time."}
{"text":"I loved coming to this place for lunch when I worked down town. The gyros were good. The best in town? I think not - I much prefer Papa's Gyros which are more flavorful. I love their fries though! The service is quick and friendly. Parking can be a pain though."}
{"text":"The owner responded to this very quickly which is nice and shows he cares. He let me know he is not Greek but it just doesn't change my opinion of the food. Just wanted to let everyone know he did respond asking what he could do to make my experience better."}
{"text":"I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by these gyros. Savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly people, great food, LARGE portions make for fine lunchtime eats.  Call ahead and see what the special of the day is.  Also, the gyro special (gyro, fries, drink) is usually $5.99--and it will fill you up."}
{"text":"In my last update, I stated that the Italian Beef didn't quite do it for me.  

I just had one today and it was completely awesome.  Totally soaked, and they gave me extra juice to boot.

I've also had a pizza puff and a slider.  The pizza puff was dead on...its all the greasiness and crispiness and gooiness that I remember from the Chi.  The slider was tasty, but don't confuse this with any White Castle offerings.  Both of these are cheap and worth tacking onto any order.

What can I say?  I love this place."}
{"text":"Couldn't muster the energy to make myself dinner, so I gyroed it up. The gyro is still very good (the pita bread is perfect), and I also got hummus and dolmas. The hummus is fine, but the dolmas were the sleeper hit of the evening. I've always been kind of iffy on dolmas and have only recently started trying them at different restaurants, and these ones are high on my list. They have a perfect leaf:rice ratio (I hate having too much gummy rice to knock back) and there was a very lively tang to the dressing. 

And kudos to Steve, the owner, for keeping up with the Yelp reviews. Good to know a business owner cares what his customers think."}
{"text":"Their cheese pizza is so good we order it every Friday night for dinner, and trust me, my husband is some kind of cheese pizza connoisseur.  I think he would live off of it if he could.  Anyway, rain or shine he's calling them to get 2 cheese pizzas every single weekend.  They are cheap (like $6), hot, cheesy, the good kind of melty, salty, heavenly mozzarella deliciousness that comes off in big gooey strings.  The sauce is flavorful and the crust is DELICIOUS.  I am not a huge fan or pizza and I even like their cheese pizza.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful falafel sandwiches and they are always so nice. Definitely worth checking out."}
