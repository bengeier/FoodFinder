{"text":"In a city with mediocre sushi, Mikado is better than most. But NEVER, ever, ever order delivery service from them. Ever heard of a 3 hour delay in the delivery and absolutely no offer of comping or otherwise addressing this problem?"}
{"text":"Consistently the best sushi restaurant I have tried in Montreal. Admittedly I have tried only a half dozen, but from the top rated one. This one is weirdly out of favour, rarely full, but the food quality and the preparations are exceptional. The chefs at the bar are very welcoming, helpful, generous and masterful in their work. Ask for the specials that are not on the menu, like the lobster roll, the tuna katsu, or the latest maki, Miss Saigon. And do not, but absolutely not, miss the deserts! All are original and delicious, I have tried them all."}
{"text":"Le service est très bien, les serveurs aimables et bienveillants. Le cadre est aussi sympa avec les fleurs et les tables près de la fenête en mode terrasse. Mais, les sushis étaient décevants! J'ai pris un des assortiment de maki et ça manquait d'originalité. De plus, le riz avait un arrière goût bizarre... Je n'y reviendrai pas."}
{"text":"Bonne atmosphère, bon sushi."}
{"text":"Everything is very good. I was sad because Miyako had closed so I went there for my birthday. Their tempura is excellent. You should try the NDG and the Titanic maki, they're the best! Though, tatamis are for 5 persons or more, and we were 3 on a monday night and we were alone. They told us on the phone that we could get a tatami if we weren't a lot in the restaurant but they didn't give us one in the end because it's \"too much work\" for them."}
{"text":"Excellent sushis, nice staff. I never know what to order so they choose for me and it's always delicious with different specialties.   Comfy seats.  If you want to take out for a group, the 80$ platter for 4 is a very good choice. Makes about 25$ per person for high quality sushis!"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance : intime à Côté de la fenêtre ou plus d'actions au bar. Sushi délicieux et bon service"}
{"text":"Mikado adds an interesting and creative touch to their sushi, with various toppings and sauces that compliment its taste. The atmosphere is intimate, quiet and comfortable... BUT it's expensive.   I recommend the ebi gyoza, sashimi (salmon is my favourite), paradise roll, mikado roll, ndg roll, and titanic roll, along with a bottle of Hakutsuru sake served cold. The lychee and green tea ice creams are a great way to end the night too!"}
{"text":"I ate here over the holidays, my only sushi experience in Montreal and I was not disappointed! Sat at the sushi bar to watch the talented chefs create, from the presentation to the food itself I would definitely come back here! I am considered a sushi snob amongst those who know me and this earned my stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is extremely good and fresh. Very talented chefs! Service is sometimes a bit slow/sloppy but great restaurant overall"}
{"text":"Salty miso soup.  Disappointing sushi.  Likely due to the possibility that it looks like not a single Japanese person works here.  The waitress had no idea what Futomaki is...sigh.  Montreal.... Not one good Japanese restaurant?"}
{"text":"We choose to ring in the New Year with a January 1st dinner at Mikado.  Unfortunately our timing couldn't have been much worse, as we found the restaurant in a state of post-New Years chaos.  Apparently when the manager showed up in the morning, he found a burst pipe and a frozen flooded foyer.  What he didn't find was two of his chefs, who celebrated the New Year a little too hard and didn't show up to work.  Of course, we never would have known of all the dysfunction if we hadn't been told (in gory detail) on the phone when we made our reservation.  Then again, by the restaurant manager when we arrived.  And again, by the three servers who waited on us.  Honestly, I don't think I would have noticed much, if we hadn't been told.  What we did notice was that service was slow, and everyone seemed a little on edge.  The tasting menu wasn't available, and the kitchen declined our request for anything off the menu.  But regardless of the crisis management (or mismanagement), our meal went smoothly and pleasantly.  The fusion between French and Japanese cuisine as prepared at Mikado just excellent.  Tuna tartar with truffle oil, and a variation on a traditional French pastry with tuna (the name of which escapes me) were both excellent.  The traditional sashimi and nigiri was very good, the quality of the fish was top notch.  And the maki was very impressive; I particularly enjoyed the NGD (Rice paper, Tuna Dynamite, Tempura, Avocado, Green Apple, Spicy Sauce) and the Paradise (Tara-Sheet, Grilled Shrimps, Asparagus, Masago, Garlic & Lite Spicy Sauce).  The best treat was the desert, a painter's palette of ice creams and sorbets.  The lychee and green tea ice cream were exceptionally good.  I would, however, avoid the crème brulee plate, which was as much a failure as the palette was a triumph.  All in all, I'll give Mikado 4 stars for good food and a creative menu, and the benefit of the doubt that the restaurant runs more smoothly on a regular basis.  I'll definitely be back for the tasting menu, and to see if they can earn that 5th star."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place a few days ago, to get some lunch for take out. We came 5 min before they closed the kitchen but they still took our order, and the waitress there was really friendly and attentive. The restaurant has a very relaxing ambience. And for the food, excellent! Ordered the Sushi & Maki Deluxe and I loved it. Even my boyfriend, who never really tries new things, or sushi for that matter, had some and actually liked it. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Wonderful ambience, attentive service, fresh sushi/sashimi...everything just works. I will most definitely be coming back. It's not as expensive as I thought it would be too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We made a $200+ delivery order which included specifics for an allergy against seaweed which required that all (or most) rolls be wrapped in rice paper instead of seaweed. After two very clear-seeming conversations over the phone, only two of the eight or so rolls were wrapped in rice paper, which was quite disappointing. The delivery arrived on time, but without chopsticks. Overall, we were embarrassed to serve our guest food that they could not eat with forks instead of chopsticks. Otherwise: the fish was fresh but the rolls poorly wrapped and unimaginative. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here on a quiet, rainy Wednesday evening. The restaurant was relatively calm and yet for some reason, the food service was remarkably slow. For four men eating together, we thought that 6 rolls with two salads would be enough. Alas, it was not, and had to order 5 more. Perhaps, we would have been suggested by the waiting staff that we did not order enough. In the end, we waited a total of 2 hours, even though there weren't that many patrons left by the end of evening. We would have perhaps appreciated the staff checking up on us, but we rarely received any attention. In the end, they unexpectedly offered us an ice cream dessert to share for the time it took for everything to come. In summary, slow good delivery, pretty similar tasting rolls with no special tastes, and service at a lower level than what we would have expected for this kind of restaurant. Acceptable, but there are other amazing and more deserving places at which to go eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant japonais! J'ai essayé la boîte bento en table d'hôte du midi, composée de six choix du chef présentée dans une belle boîte en bois. En entrée, la soupe miso et la salade verte sont inclus dans le repas ainsi qu'un petit dessert ( un gâteau à la noix de coco ce jour--là. )Très bon rapport qualité--prix le midi! Le soir, c'est beaucoup plus cher, par contre. Nous avons essayé des sushis à la carte qui étaient excellent, mais un peu cher à mon goût!   La décoration est classique japonaise et l'ambiance est relaxe. Le restaurant semble plus grand que je ne l'imaginais!  Par contre, le serveurs étaient un peu confus (manque de communication?). Nous étions un groupe de sept personnes et avons demandé à plusieurs reprises du thé vert, servi dans une toute petite théière, trop peu de thé pour la quantité de convives que nous étions. Il fallait demander des cuillères pour le dessert, des baguettes pour le repas parce qu'il n'y en avait pas assez pour tout le monde! Un peu dommage :(   Je recommande surtout pour le repas le midi et la table d'hôte qui offre un bon choix."}
{"text":"Always always a bad customer service experience  This place does not care about you from management to hostesses to delivery drivers  Never again"}
{"text":"Meilleurs sushis que j'ai mangés! L'endroit est vraiment joli et on y trouve une belle ambiance calme, détendue et feutrée. Les plats que nous avons dégustés étaient tous meilleurs les uns que les autres, autant les salades que les sushis que les brochettes que les rouleaux. Pour une soirée où on veut se payer la traite avec des plats de grande qualité, c'est au Mikado que ça se passe!"}
{"text":"We always used to order here but today was extremely dissapointing service. We ordered for a delivery. We called about an hour and a half later and they said food is on its way. We live 10 minutes by car from the restaurant. 2 hours later, no food has arrived. We finally received the food. We talked to the driver. He said it's not his fault, he just took the order from the restaurant 5 minutes ago.  Think twice before asking for delivery, Also, we paid in advance (including tip we will never get back)Oh hey,  soy sauce and chopsticks NOT included with the delivery."}
{"text":"Wow...how fast they fall! We used to love Mikado but either they have new management or someone new coordinating in the kitchen. The salad was not fresh; it was also swimming in dressing. This is the second time within a month that our handrolls came out as maki. The waitress blamed it on the kitchen, but I doubt it. She circled, in black marker, what we ordered on the sushi menu. Although she apologized, instead of taking something off the bill, she just brought an ice cream of a flavour that I can't stand. If you want to make up for a messed up order, why not ask the client what he/she likes? Why not comp one or two of the dishes you screwed up? This just shows a total lack of professionalism and, our \"go to sushi\" place has not become our \"never return\" place. Too bad."}
