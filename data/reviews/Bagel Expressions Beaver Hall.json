{"text":"Always delicious and def worth the wait! It's quite busy in here but they do their best to please everyone! Thumb up"}
{"text":"It was a cool, yet lovely Sunday morning.   Workout complete, we headed out for breakfast.  Down the street from our hotel we had passed this place over the past few days and it looked cute

Thirty minutes into our visit, our party of five had one meal, and two drinks served.  Forty five minutes in, one more was served.  I had yet to see my coffee.  An hour in, I asked a server if we were on hidden camera and being pranked?   I really did

Eventually, one hour and fifteen minutes in.  We had all eaten our strangely staggered meal


Lessons learned:

The food was ok.  But so is Tim's
I'm sorry goes a long way.  We never heard the words
You can do better.  Move along.  There's nothing to see here folks"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has poor reviews.. Every time I visit Montreal I always go there. The food is excellent, service was fast, the crepes and omelette are the best. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great place to get a healthy, yummy brunch. Very good customer service. Love  the \"omelet quebecois\""}
{"text":"While at a conference at the Plais du Congress, I visited this spot three times in two days! Great authentic dishes of Montreal, and great service even during very busy times. Not the best decor, nor a \"fancy\" spot by any means, but if you're looking for a good meal or snack this is a great option."}
{"text":"Never again!!  Can't even blame the staff which is made up of young people trying their best without any direction from the bosses.  Waited for an hour just to get our food.  Ended up just grabbing our food once I saw it was completed and waiting to b delivered to our table. Food wasn't bad which makes it all the more shameful to give this place a bad review."}
{"text":"I almost feel terrible for saying such bad things about this place because our server, a girl who looked about 12, was so sweet, and the service issues could not be blamed on her as she seemed to be manning the entire place by herself.  That said, after sitting down my husband and I ordered after not having a server come to us for about 15 minutes.  Then we ordered coffee which didn't come until AFTER our food came.  When it came it was cold.  The food was average but I couldn't even enjoy it because I didn't have my drink with it!  How can you be at a restaurant for over a half hour with no drink!? Who serves the first order, drinks, AFTER the food!?  Then we had to wait for utensils.  When I finally got a diet coke that I ordered it didn't come with ice so I had to wait another 15 minutes for that, and also had to remind the waitress to get it once.  This place could have been decent but I literally had the worst service I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"We got this place reccomended  to us by our hotel concierge. I don't know how others did not like this place. The service was extremely quick and the good was amazing.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our meal.

The Moccachino's were excellent,  the wip cream on top was even better. They were very creative with breakfast,  my banana and strawberry crepe had a dolphin made out of banana. My boyfriend had the Western Omelet he said was also very good.

The bathroom could use a little TLC the only downer. Not dirty just run down.

Loved it!"}
{"text":"Good for breakfast, but nothing too extraordinary. Very decent service and rather average, yet tasty breakfast items. One thing I was not impressed was their crepes - too sweet and thick. Their omelettes and bagels sandwiches were very decent. 

It has an authentic feel to it and they have a very nice outside patio."}
{"text":"Okay, I am a tourist and this was our first stop.  We did go to a few other crepe joints and in hind sight, this was the best.  Chris, the owner was fantastic.  He was very engaging, asked questions, made recommendations.  The service was really awesome.  I will caveat by saying it was not rush our, so I don't know what happens in rush hour though.  But, for us, it was perfect.  

We had mixed berry crepe.  I forget the name but it was his specialty and a freshly made bagel  with cheese.  This was enough food for three of us.  It was really, really good.

As for being a tourist, I have spent several years in Europe, so I get the crepe scene.  We love them and I do have some knowledge.  Lastly, when going to a new city for the first time, it is wonderful to have a 'first experience' with someone like Chris."}
{"text":"Wow! what a waste of 80 minutes. Breakfast ordered within 5 minutes of walking in ( good ) and no coffee or water on the table for 35 minutes?! ( fail! ) and no food until almost 60 minutes?! ( fail! ) People around us waited for almost an hour. Very disappointed by the first breakfast place we went to in Montreal. Food was ok but the slow service killed what could have been an ok breakfast. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast salmon with egg (the deluxe) and it was awesome.  The service was incredibly fast even with just one person doing everything.  Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Well, I had high hopes. Its sometimes tricky finding  breakfast with gluten-free options. This place surfaced up several times.
It's the place you find hungover Americans. There is no ambience,  being on a highrise street.  You can,  however,  sit outside.  The server seemed harassed,  but pleasant nevertheless.  The omelettes are really good.  The gluten-free bagels are underwhelming.  Get the omelet.  Not great for vegans.  With so much awesomeness,  think we'll try something else."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I'm surprised it only has a 3.5 rating on Yelp, but I guess my 5-star rating is strictly for the food as I've never eaten at the restaurant. My work has been catering breakfast from here for almost 4 years now so I've tried a lot of items on their menu. My favorites are the Western paninis and crepes. Great quality and portion size!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has poor reviews. For a small cafe, it isn't going to be fine dining, it is what it is. The food was fantastic, the omelettes were great. We ended up going here 3 times during our stay at Le Westin. I recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place as they have crepes and when in Montreal..you know. From the outside patio the place looks a bit dirty but I was hungry & couldn't walk up hill anymore. Went inside & looks like your typical greasy spoon cafe. No frills joint. The floors could do with a sweeping/cleaning Very friendly service greets you. You seat yourself. 
Getting to the nitty gritty I ordered the \"la populaire\" crepe which is a large crepe filled with a variety of fruits & topped with nutella. It was yummy, the crepes were soft & good thickness to hold the stuffing inside. The other crepe we had was the savoury type; called \"sugar shack\" which is basically an omelette  & choice of meat inside- went with bacon. It was ok. The crepe batter on this one was dry on the outside, so I'm not sure what happened.The egg had no flavour. Barely any cheese inside. It was $11.99 for it.  You could share it depending on how hungry you are. For the way this place is kept I couldn't help feel my money would be better spent elsewhere cause I spent $35 for brunch. I'm come si come ca about this place. We had to wait a long time for our crepes(40 minutes) -long time for our drinks to come too. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. the guy made a crepe for me that was amazing !!! He was so great and nice and really extraordinary service !!!! The coffee was terrific !"}
{"text":"Sub-par overpriced diner food with incredibly slow service. Our meals came 10 minutes apart, so by the time I started to eat, my wife and son were finished. And the salade ni√ßoise was disgusting. I ate mine as I was really hungry, but another woman in there sent hers back refusing to pay. The lettuce tasted like it came out the same can as the tuna."}
{"text":"Good crepes. It took two times for them to make my wife's because they kept forgetting to leave the aioli off. Once they got it right it went down fast."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on my Saturday walk. I kept it simple and ordered a tuna sandwich which came with all this crazy stuff on it. I opted out of the crazy stuff. The one young lady working there was really friendly so I felt bad when I became rather annoyed with her for bringing me no napkins and cutlery when she had said she would be right back with them. Since they were right there, and that it's kind of stupid that there are servers there when most things can be picked up yourself, I walked over to the counter and got my own stuff. Totally oblivious, she sweetly asked \"is everything alright?\" It's mostly a breakfast/brunch place, so probably better to stop in for some eggs or an omelet. I bet the place fills up in the morning."}
{"text":"Simply the worst dining experience I have ever had. Waited an hour. They messed up our orders. Food came out at different times. Watched a waitress leave food in front of a customer and walk away, a few min later customer flagged her down to let her know it was not the right order... She picked it up and delivered the dish to another table. This place should be shut down!!!"}
{"text":"David Craig, Kiss My Ass

   The Mediterranean Crepe at Bagel Expressions is one of my favourite things to have for  breakfast on the face of the earth. I would eat here all the time, when I used to work across the street.

 The restaurant is a great spot to have a quiet coffee and a delicious brekky. The Cayenne sauce they puts on the Crepes may induce orgasms.
