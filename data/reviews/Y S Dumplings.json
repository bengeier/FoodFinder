{"text":"Decent food & reasonably cheap prices. Pot stickers, dumplings & wontons are excellent.  Spring Onion pancakes were a little on the thin side with loosely scattered greens. Would return again to satisfy some dumpling cravings."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered a bunch of items. As always, my eyes were bigger than my appetite. 

It was deceiving because price was so cheap that we ordered extra, thinking portions would be small but were we wrong.  Each dish was more than enough for two to share. We ordered spicy pigs ear, jelly fish, cabbage with sauce, steam (meat and seafood) dumpling, pan fried (lamb and carrot) dumpling, Beef offal noodle soup.
Dishes worth mentioning were panned fried (lamb and carrot) dumpling and spicy pig's ear.

Panned fried (lamb and carrot) dumpling's skin was not thick and filled with enough stuffing. It was flavourful and did not have a strong lamb smell.

Spicy pig's ear had all the right spices with a nice kick. This was the best dish. If you've never had this, it an acquired taste because it's considered a delicacy and has a crunchy texture.

Another item that is an acquired taste is Beef Offal Noodle soup because it had a strong smell due to beef offal.  The soup was perfect because it was not over salted like many restaurants (definitely home cooked) and noodles had a chewy texture with bounce.

Overall, this restaurant wouldn't be my first choice because there is \"Asian Legend\" and \"Dumpling King\" in the same plaza that serves Northern Chinese Cuisine. But out of the three, this wins in price. However, my girlfriend and I still prefer \"Dumpling King\" because they have a lot of winning dishes."}
{"text":"I love northern Chinese food! The price here is good and the food is delicious. My parents enjoy that they don't excessively use salt like many other restaurants. That isn't to say that the food isn't flavourful though! We got great service the couple of times I visited.  

I cannot read Chinese at all so I appreciate that their menu has English translation so I have no difficulty ordering at all!"}
{"text":"Y S Dumplings is a new Northern Chinese restaurant that specialized in dumplings just opened up on Midland just north of Finch.

What is Y S? That's the initial of the owner/cook... so she named the business after her name...

Here the menu is really simple, you have of course choices of pan fried dumplings and steamed dumplings... And for my vegetarian friend... there is a pumpkin version to choose from.

Bean Curd Brain? (Tofu pudding) $2.99
- a savoury, spicy and tart version and it sizable....
- a nice mixture of shallot, chili, cumin, soya sauce and some grounded peppercorn (maybe?)
- silky and smooth tofu.... 

Meat & Leek Pan Fried Dumpling $4.99
- crispy and chewy wrappings..when I eat dumplings I usually enjoy more the wrappings then the filling itself...
-filling is good..but the chives/leek taste is not as prominent as I usually like

Free Rice Congee to go with your dumplings, that's a nice gesture!

Waiter staff is really knowledgeable and eager help and give you suggestions....
