Great Tom Yum

{"text":"Incredible every time! The food speaks for itself and the service is always so welcoming! It's our go-to for Thai in the city!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday a little after 5pm. There were literally 2 tables occupied and one lone person at the bar. 
We took 10 minutes to look over the menu and decide what we wanted. And another 5-10 minutes for the waitress to come back to take the orders. 
Spring rolls came under 15 minutes as well and one ice tea. 
However, after that we had a dry spell wait for 40 minutes in which by that time the restaurant started filling up for dinner time. 
When I politely asked a server if our food was going to take any longer, he replied briskly, \"the mains usually take up to thirty minutes. This is not fast food.\" I felt it was unnecessarily rude of him to say that. I was not expecting it to be fast food at all but I also did not expect it to take a full two hours to have one meal. 

As for the food itself, it was pretty good. We had pad grapaow rice and boat noodle  they were delicious but definitely not worth the wait. We also ordered a couple of cocktails (tonglor and bangrak.) Both were good. 
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant. But the wait and service was not worth it. 

PS. I noticed that other people that came in after us got food much much fast in comparison to our table. 

TL;DR 
Good food, Unnecessarily mean fat man as an employee to tell us that it was not a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Walked out just as quickly as we walked in. Traveled from Cambridge to specially have dinner here and seeing as we arrived to an empty restaurant It would be ok to sit in the back (as it is our anniversary) but we rudely told we only had the choice between the two worst tables in the house. If we came in at a busy time we would understand but still would never understand how the owner would not want to accommodate the customer. Went down the st and was politely sat in minutes."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!!! We had the Khao soi with chicken, pad Thai, coconut rice, Vietnamese spring rolls, and tok yum soup. My absolute favourite was the Khao soi, followed by the Vietnamese spring rolls (fried), and then the Tom yum. Everything was very flavourful and the prices were decent for the sizes. 

The restaurant is very cramped and noisy (not my style), so that's why it loses a star for me. But otherwise, I would come back for the food!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Wait time on a Saturday night wasn't too bad (30-45 min), given this place is bumping and there's not too much table space. Loved the soups we ordered in the beginning, I highly recommend that. The fried chicken was a little salty for my taste, but the others at the table loved it. 
ALL the mains were outstanding. 
- Khao Soi
- Green curry
- Pad See Ew (my FAV)

Can't wait to come back and try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and liked it until the recent and probably my very last visit here.
Got seated right away which was amazing. The seats were pretty crammed since the restaurant is pretty small. But that's the usual anyways.

I ordered \"Somtam\" and \"Pad Thai\" and both were BAD.
Somtam was very salty. So salty that my tongue started burning. (was not spicy at all!)
then I got my Pad Thai which was VERY SWEET. I kept adding the chili flakes hoping to 
tone the sweetness down and it did nothing. the noodles were stuck together and I had to stop eating half way through.

Maybe it was just my lucky day but I don't think I will be testing my luck here ever again."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here 3 times.  The first two times the food was pretty decent - not like Khao San Road, but decent.  The last time the food (same order) was fairly inedible.  We picked at it a bit, but ultimately we gave up on it and found food elsewhere (which made it a waste of money)."}
{"text":"Pad Thai and curries are awesome. Service can be lacking sometimes though, with the occasional long wait, but it's not enough to overshadow the solid food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Similar to Sukho Thai and Sabai Sabai, but not as great.

The staff and the owner are attentive and make sure their customers are satisfied. I'm not a fan of communal tables but we were fortunate enough to get a 4-seater away from everyone (towards end of the night).
 
Khao Soi - had a nice twist, noodles served with fried chicken. It was a nice change from how the dish is usually prepared.

Yellow Curry - a little too salty for my liking but it was good overall."}
{"text":"Do you want to sit on tiny, red, plastic chairs that a five year old would balk at around a tiny table where another couple of strangers are forced to join you to eat tiny portions of mediocre Thai food?"}
{"text":"Been eating Thai food in GTA for years.  Decided to try it out despite the amount of negative reviews.  I was very disappointed with service and food quality.  Was hoping it would be similar to Khao San Road but was no where close.  I will never return to this establishment.  Bad food, bad service and way over priced for the quality.  Even complained about the food and the server didn't care to hear our feedback.  Maybe if they actually listened to some of the feedback they could improve.  Save your money and avoid this establishment."}
{"text":"Tried this place last week, being a huge fan of everything KSR has to offer. 

Started with the pork and crab spring rolls, which were delicious. They were crispy, and the meats combined together really well. The dipping sauce added the perfect amount of heat.

For the main dish, I had the Pad Thai. Overall, it was okay. There was too much fish sauce, overpowering the other flavours of the dish. Adding chili flakes helped improve the flavours tremendously.

It was busy when we arrived (group of three) but we did get a table to ourselves. It's a pretty small space, so the restaurant gets crowded and loud very quickly. 

Service was okay. Due to being packed, servers weren't as attentive as they could have been, but they can't be faulted for having a lot of people to serve. They were friendly, answered our questions and got the orders right.

All in all, it was a good meal."}
{"text":"Who gives a knife and fork for Thai food? No chopsticks for noodle soup?  Nothing special even the blood noodle soup, everything is very sweet...also ordered beers right away and had them come a while after the food, that's not right...also has anyone eaten at Khao San Road, same ownership...have you ordered the pad Thai? It's tiny!  Rice noodles aren't expensive man...you guys just seem miserly and cheap when you nickel and dime people...it's more expensive than other Thai places...doesn't mean it should have small portions...save your time and money and go to Pai nearby, no tiny pad Thai there..."}
{"text":"Enfin du vrai Thaï.
La salade de papaye était fantastique et le curry vert aussi.
Nous avons pris \"thai spicy\" et c'était une souffrance agréable.
Nous avons partagé une salade et un curry. Pour un total de 30$.
C'est un peu cher mais ça en vaut le prix."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Bartender is awesome, we loved the drinks. Food was just OK compared to Khao San Road. I would go back to try the rest of the menue."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, well-portioned, very authentic.The pretension it is served with seemed unnecessary. Two of us arrived to an empty restaurant, and the waitress refused to sit us in the table we preferred (away from the draft coming from the main door). Then, I requested to have my dish medium, not super-hot. The waitress lectured me on how that was attempting against the integrity of the recipe and \"at Nana we don't substitute or change anything\". I can understand not making considerable changes to the recipe, but toning back the amount of chilies thrown in doesn't seem like a disrespect tot he authenticity of the dish. Just my thought."}
{"text":"We ordered one Tom yum soup, beef noodle and green curry with chicken. Liked the Tom yum soup but wish there was more of a shrimp taste in it. The green curry was good but didn't quite like the beef noodle. Their Thai tea is not bad but a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Terrible, sticky food on the menu, talk about the menu having everything on it. 

Ran out of wine glasses.

Cancelled my meal."}
{"text":"Went here on sat night and it was quite busy. Shared the chicken pad thai, chicken fried rice, egg noodle soup. The food is quite good much better than your average thai restaurant.  food was prob 9/10. Atmosphere 6/10. very cramp and loud and busy.  Value 5/10. Service 8/10. 

Dont kid yourself, this place is very pricey. 80$ for 3 ppl. Portion is normal too fit for one person. One dish is the equalivent of two pad thai's at thai express and its marginally better quality. 

atmosphere is for hipsters. 70-80s music running in background. doesnt match the thai theme. chairs are uncomfortable. 

Overall good to try since its related to Khao san road restaurant but not a regular place to go repeatedly."}
{"text":"One of the really authentic Thai restaurants in town . The Khao soi curry dish in a kind of dry version is simply the closet food experience one can get compared to the food in Thailand . The dishes are not that filling in portion compared to the higher price tag for them. But surely most of the dishes are tasty and worth a try. This place is Khao Son Roads sister restaurant ."}
{"text":"While walking around Queen street with some friends we stopped into Nana. The restaurant is set up well with a window that opens onto the street which I love. We started with pork screwers which were really nice. Then my favourite the fried chicken with an amazing spice blend and green onions. I highly recommend this dish!! Then we finished up the meal with the pad thai. A very high quality pad thai I might add it was very nice. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would encourage anyone who is around the neighbourhood to try out this gem!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. For a restaurant going for a street food vibe, meals averaging to $20 after tax and tips is definitely not street food prices. Also a 18% tip was already added to the bill."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Khao San Road so I can't comment on whether Nana holds up to the hype of being an offshoot of such well respected Thai restaurant. But, I'm hoping it stands on its own two feet, popular parent or not. Because it was just that good. 

Yes, it's squashed, but they tell you that as you walk in, so you know what you are getting into! We had the pork and shrimp spring rolls which were very delicious, crispy and a salty balance of shaved pork and shrimp. I actually would have been completely satisfied with a few orders of these for my meal. But I was craving curry.

For mains, the Khao Soi with Chicken was scrumptious, complete with very creamy and decadent curry based sauce. We also had the Red Curry with veggie and tofu, which was all so fragrant but killer spicy. Good spicy. I could only handle small spoon dips into the sauce. If you only have a light tolerance for the heat (like me), stick with a milder dish. They mean it when they say this is the hottest dish!

Overall, we'll come back. It's worth the squeeze and probably worth the wait now that there are line ups."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had to get utensils, napkins and condiments for own group of people. Servers extremely rude and slow. Food came very slowly. Gratuity of 18% automatically put in place so it seemed like the servers just didn't care for providing service. Servers over charged my group and was rude about their mistake."}
{"text":"4/5! for those of you who like Khao San Road or similar restaurants, I definitely recommend this place. For starters, order the fresh pork rolls and the southern fried chicken laab. For mains, I recommend the pad mama with hot dog and boat noodle soup with beef. The papaya salad, khao soi and pad gra friend rice are all good BUT the same as other places (not unique to Nana). Overall, we really liked this place because it was good food, minimal wait time for a friday night (10 minutes) and reasonably priced :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try Khao San Road, however it's close on Victoria Weekend so found Nana instead, which is the sister restaurant. There was a bit of a line up when I arrived however only waited for around 5 mins. The place is quick packed and noisy but nice and colourful. 

Ordered a tom yum soup with shrimp, chicken Laab, Khao soi with fried chicken and a banana roti. 

The chicken Laab came first, it's like a fried chicken with a zesty taste. I liked it, however it's a bit salty for me. Then we waited for 20mins for the second dish to arrive which was the Khao soi with fried chicken. I really liked this dish it's like fried noodles, noodles and fried chicken in a soupy base. But our soup never came so we told the server and waited another 20mins for it to arrive. The Tom yum soup was okay, had a very strong coconut base. Then lastly we ordered the banana roti which was so yummy. Roti with banana fried in butter with condense milk, very satisfying! 

Overall I liked the food and atmosphere, however I think the service took too long. Our dinner took 2 hours but most of the time was waiting for something we already ordered long time ago, and for people to clean the table. So if you're not in a rush, then for sure give this a try. Check for photos I posted for dinner :) Cheers! QV"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with a group of friends tonight, thinking it would be a good meal. We've all been to the sister restaurant, Kao San Road, and thought Nana would be just as good. We ordered the curry, pad Thai, boat noodles and khao soi. We were all disappointed. Service was mediocre. If you're looking for a good Thai meal, don't go to Nana."}
{"text":"Overall experience was okay. We got there at 9pm on a Saturday and it was packed so we left our name and number with the host, who said it shouldn't be longer than 30 mins. After waiting 45 mins with no phone call we went back to Nana and saw tables open. The host said she had called us (not true) but there was no answer.

We ordered right away but were disappointed to find out that they were out of spring rolls, the khao soi AND the pad see ew. We ended up sharing the southern fried chicken laab (so delicious) and satay grilled chicken (decent) and I had the red Thai curry as my entree (also delicious). 

I probably won't be back. Would rather go to Khao San road or Sukho Thai."}
{"text":"After these negative reviews it seems like they have really stepped up their service game. 
We came in on a Friday night when the place was packed. Everything was quick and delicious from drinks to dinner. They ran out of chicken when we got there (around 8:30) but we're open to making those dishes with beef or pork instead."}
{"text":"We were 6 adults and a baby and the staff were amazing at accommodating our party and making sure that we were comfortable. Loved the ambiance, and the food was very, very good. The green curry is the best I have had outside of Thailand, and boat noodle soup was absolutely delish, complex and well balanced flavours. Not my favourite khao soi in the city, but reminiscent of the khao soi in local markets of Chiangmai. Dishes were a little small for the prices, but quality ingredients and cooking!"}
{"text":"Easily habit forming. Not sure what's in the sticky rice but it's so good!!"}
{"text":"In short: rude staff and overpriced. 

First time I went here I dined in, sat at the bar and it was awesome. But they weren't busy and was served by the manager.

Second time ordered pick up, was told to get there in 15. I said I could only get there in 20, as in \"can you delay placing the order so the food is fresh when I arrive.\" She said no lol

So I mad rush to get there, there are about five people waiting in the front and only one person is attending to this one guy who's fighting his bill or something. I the staff I'm here to do a quick pick up. He takes my name, and then I somehow find  myself waiting for another 20 minutes for my meal. No one following up, no one asking if I'm being helped. Just chaos.

So I asked one of the people behind the bar what's happening, and she gets angry with me and says she's attending to one of her customers at the bar. 

Turns out the food was waiting all along.

$35 for cold green curry, pad see ew, and being told off. No thanks."}
{"text":"Food:
Pad See Ew: very tasty. It had a very good balance between sweet and salty. I also loved the thick noodles. (Exactly the same dish as  Khao San Road) 
Banana Roti: not a fan of bananas but the roti it self was very good. Chewy but also crispy, very well balanced with the condensed milk.

Service:
Not super attentive and it did took a while for the food to come, but still acceptable and friendly for the most part."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try the Fare on offer at Nana. Arrived at 7pm and told the staff that we have a party of 4 with 3 present and 1 to follow. He gave us a wait time of 15 minutes, and we duly began to wait at the curb. 45 minutes later, after seeing numerous other parties being seated, we asked the staff person once again about our table. His response, verbatim - 'I will not seat you now until your fourth person is here'. When we stated that we are happy to be seated as a party of 3, his response was 'we don't seat groups of 3 since we are so busy'. Nana, good luck to you since you're already so busy that you don't need our business.  I will make sure that my entire network of friends (all young professionals) don't waste your time either."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The decor/environment is fun and corny. The place is full of young cool people indulging in Thai street food. 
I thought the food was good... But greasy and the flavors were kind of off. The red curry was a but too spicy (ordered a 6) and it lacked depth and richness. This is a good place to go with friends when you are in a budget!"}
{"text":"So Monte Wan had Yelp delete my review so I'm going to try to write another one where there is nothing he can complain about. 

First I came here when it first opened and the restaurant couldn't handle the crowd. I believe this is because everyone heard this place was affiliated with Khao San Road and they want to see what new items there would be. When I saw the menu, it was a big let down. Most of the items were the exact same as as KSR and the ones that weren't, were similar except with one or two ingredients different. This is not surprising to me because since Monte lost his partners at KSR, he hasn't been able to create any new dishes. He's been riding on the success of his partners recipes for quite some time. 

The second time I came here, it was just before the dinner rush. There was only one other table. After getting out appetizer it took 45 minutes to get our mains so we complained. Monte, himself, personally came over to address our complaint. How nice of him you would think. Not really. He came over to say \"this isn't fast food, you know?\"  Next was the Khao soi we ordered was luke warm at best. After bringing it to their attention they threw it in the microwave, I presume, because it came out 3 minutes later piping hot but clearly just reheated. 

So there you have it. Those were my TWO EXPERIENCES there. Indicative of exactly what the owner is like. If you enjoy it here. Keep coming. If not, there are better places in Toronto. 

And no, Monte, as much as you want to whine and cry to Yelp, I am NOT affiliated with Pai. It's not hard to see that when you simply Google me, you can see where I work. I'm not even in the food/drink industry."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Although older adults will cringe at the elbow-to-elbow seating and loud 90s music, the young and fun crowd will enjoy this little restaurant! 

Current faves:
Vietnamese-style spring rolls with pork & crab - perfect appetizer
Boat noodle soup with beef - reminiscent of a flavourful dinuguan (Pinoys know)
Mi ga ti with pork - perfect when you like a sweeter sauce

Tip: If you find their menu daunting because you don't know khao soi from pad prik king, don't worry-- flip the menu over and every dish is explained in detail. No need to bring a Thai phrasebook. ;)"}
{"text":"We visited Nana this Thursday at around 8:30 pm.

When we first arrived, the restaurant was about 50% full, but became completely full shortly after.  In terms of the restaurant design, I loved it.  The communal table sitting space was a bit cramped, but didn't bother me that much.  For us, the service was friendly and well-paced.

Now for the food...

It was really tough to figure out if I would rate this a 3-star or 4-star, but I just can't deny how great the food is at Khao San, which I would rate a 4-star.  So... I'm giving the little sister, Nana, 3 stars, but that isn't a bad thing as every single food item we ate was good.  

Here's a quick food review:

Tom yum soup:  really good balance of sweet/sour - loved it. Will order it every single time I come back.

Vietnamese spring rolls:  a different take on spring rolls. Tasted good, but perhaps a bit meat-heavy for me.

Chef's pad gra prao fried rice:   this was good.  I loved the chopped green beans, which added a nice texture to the dish.  The egg on top was a bit too decadent for me, but the rice was tasty. 

Banana roti:  how could you not love fried crepe wrapped banana??  

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Agree with Brendan C.'s review. Might as well pay the same $$ and have the same food in a much better atmosphere at Khao San Road, Sabai Sabai, or Suhko Thai."}
{"text":"Love Khao-San road.  The same smart owner does not just have the good look but also a smart brain to open Nana a sister restaurant on queen west

Went with two friends. It was busy. And we booked in advanced. Owner told me they don't really take reservations because it's not good for table turnover.  

Anyway. I love the beef and beef ball noodle soup. It's not Vietnamese soup. Not Chinese neither. It has some cinnamon and sweet taste to it.  Beef is slow cooked the beef ball tastes awesome. 

Owner and servers are friendly.   My friend said the food and atmosphere made her feel like eating in the night market in Thailand.   The plastic stools are brilliant so night market eatery setup.   Love the heat in the yellow curry.  Love the papaya salad.  If you like spicy food, need to order the milk tea. 
Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Well, the food tasted not bad, but the price was pretty high, which i think is definitely not worthy. And I found something weird. Why they just include the tips into the bill, like 18%? We cannot give tips as much as we wish, based on their service and food quality. That really makes us feel uncomfortable. And I think I will never return. The worst experience in Thai restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"Here's the gist of my experience here:
-Came at 5.30PM and it still looks deserted
-Finished ordering at 5.36PM
-Thai Ice Tea came at 5.37PM

After that it just went downhill...
-A guy came around 6PM got his order before me
-Finally got my Beef Noodle Soup at 6.39PM
-There was no sorry or anything. Servers mostly just ignored me. The owner chat with me for a couple of times.
-I asked the server who was helping me with the card machine. He didn't seem empathic and just said that one person didn't come
-His explanation was ridiculous. I came when it was still deserted and a guy who came 30 mins after me when it was crowded got his food before me?
-If they are missing a staff, why didn't they tell me that the food is going to come in an hour?
-Isn't it customary to tell customer that the food is going to be longer than 15 minutes?
-The experience of being ignored and not knowing whether I should leave or wait for my food was horrible

The food:
The Beef Noodle Soup was a bit too sour for me. Like it has too much tamarind and not warm at all. Tasted like it's been sitting there for hours. Then again, if you're made to wait for around an hour in limbo, anything will taste sour. I'm just gonna stick to Khao San and PAI for my thai food until they manage to train their staff here."}
{"text":"I didn't have a chance to try the food yet. We were declined to be seated because some of my friends hadn't arrived and they wouldn't seat an incomplete party. I absolutely understand if there's no unoccupied table and if there's a line up. In fact, it was a weeknight, there were obviously 2-3 unoccupied tables without reservations (as we asked the server), and no line up at all. But they insisted that we had to wait. That got me mad (well you know a hungry man is an angry man) because we could have had some snacks and drinks while waiting. After asking the server for 2-3 times if we could be seated and have some food first and being declined, I knew I would never come back again."}
{"text":"It was delicious and I was super pumped that I could have lunch with my vegan and everyone got to eat something they liked!"}
{"text":"You've never had fried chicken like this, it's a spicy, tangy and is a star on a menu of winners. I'm looking forward to trying the noodle soups. Everything on the menu is bold and adventurous without being ridiculous. The decor is simple and comfortable. The menus are stapled to the wall. Apparently they will have cocktails soon, not that I needed any more reasons to come back. Please take my word for it, save room for dessert. It is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing every time I go! Thai iced teas seemed to have gotten bigger. Food is extremely flavorful. We always get a seat around 530pm :)"}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 8/10

Although I'm giving 8's (and 80% in school was a stand-up grade), I still am giving 3/5 stars. Nana was a restaurant I hit when I was going through my Thai phase. 

I had the pad thai (I mean, when you're on a Thai kick, you really have to judge using this classic dish) and it was good. Good not great.

One thing I liked about the place was that they give you three types of hot sauce. They explain them in a great way - \"this one is more sweet spicy\", \"this one is hot balls\" - and I love variety when it comes to how spicy to make my dish. 

The interior is cute. Very trendy although the stools make it hard to put your purse down somewhere. Practical note for the ladies and select men. 

The bottom line: normal Thai food with a trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious pad siu, good service, good portions. The aesthetic of the small place has a cool feel too."}
{"text":"According to the Yelpers, this place is one of the best if not the best Thai restaurant in town. So couple of weeks ago, I decided to try out their chicken Pad See Ew, chicken Khao Soi and beef Pad Kee Mao. Everything was extremely oily. I could literally feel oil circulating in my stomach after digesting them. Pad See Ew was not only oily but also way too sweet. I'm not a chef by any means, nor am I a cooking expert but since I regularly cook for myself and thoroughly enjoy my meals, I know the fact that you don't need to pour the entire oyster sauce into one meal to add some flavor. Was the bottle of sauce getting close to the expiry date and whoever was behind the kitchen had to get rid of it immediately? After tasting their meals, I was flabbergasted of how Yelpers were raving about this place. Maybe it could be a decent meal while being tipsy. Maybe they just had a bad day on that particular evening.. or maybe... my expectations were just too high. I will never know unless I return to this place multiple times. Until then, bye bye."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after a hospital visit and ordered the Bangkok pad Thai and Kung paid chicken.  Food came quickly and was very tasty.  Ambience is lively and pleasant - music and decor inviting.  The place was full for the Saturday lunch crowd.  I'd rate the food perhaps 3.5 but the service was well worth the gamble and we'd stop in again."}
{"text":"Came in around dinner time on a Saturday.
Got seated at the bar right away, I didn't mind since I went alone. 

Quickly got a menu and water. Service was okay but my server could've been more friendly. Didn't get a thank you or bye on my way out. 

Food
Tom yum soup to start off was very good and had 2 large pieces of shrimps in it but I just wished the soup had less pieces of lemongrass in it. I don't mind chewing on a few small pieces but some of them were big pieces that I would rather not chew on. I enjoyed the flavour and liked that they had 4 types of chili or hot sauce to use in your food. I would come back for more Tom yum but I feel like $6 should get you a bowl that is a little bigger. 

I got Pad see ew with chicken as my main and it was pretty good. A little saltier than I'd like as well as sweet but the lime helped tone it down a little. I ate half my noodles since I felt full and got the rest to go. My mom tried the noodles and said it was authentic since she grew up in Thailand.

I would come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Mark Pupo , in the Toronto Life issue of April 2015, recommends 20 Toronto restaurants that he will \" visit again and again \". I follow Toronto Life recommendations selectively if not blindly. Mark's number one recommendation Buca of Yorkville was a disaster and my review appeared in Yelp almost a year ago before April 2015. 
Number 9 on the recommended list is Nana. Mark has classified it as \" Street Style Thai Worth Waiting For \" I would not go to the length of calling Nana's menu as street food of Thailand as I have been there a couple of times. How could it be without skewered meats and veggies? Nana's menu is limited which is good news and I will rate the dishes 7 on a scale of 10. The 4 chilli jars that arrive at the table gladdened my heart. 

I would have liked to spend more money at the restaurant but the 18\" stool height and the narrow base made  it difficult to enjoy the food in comfort. It is a place where you eat and get out. Extremely uncomfortable to sit on a stool. Nana should initiate cost/ value analysis of introducing comfortable chairs and incremental revenue per table versus the stool format and the loss of revenue due to discomfort of stools. No matter what, a restaurant is obligated to provide comfortable ambience to its customers and more importantly Toronto Life should highlight the criteria on the opening page as to how the restaurants were selected to attain the top 20 listing. For my guests who traveled 20 miles to visit the much touted Nana by Toronto Life was a disaster. By the way ignore the comment by Mark Pupo in his review that Monte Wan, the owner \" meets you at the door and becomes friends with everyone in the room \" No such luck for us. If Monte Wan was there to meet us at the door I would not have missed the opportunity to relay my views of the restaurant. Would I go to Nana again? Never. I will consider a take out or Delivery service from Nana. Lesson learnt, don't get carried away by reviews when the criteria of selection is vague. That is why I pay attention to Zagat reviews. Pity, to the best of my knowledge Zagat does not review Toronto restaurants.

{"text":"I visited Nana on a Sunday evening after work with four other friends. We had all traveled some way to get there and were appropriately cold and hungry. Unfortunately, one of our friends was stuck on a subway delay and we could not be seated until our entire party was present. I know a lot of places do this, but the guy in the front kept mentioning that there was a table reserved for us (which fit either four or five and certainly no more) but we weren't allowed to sit at it. Even though there was no one else waiting to be seated. Even though we were awkwardly hanging out by the front door. *shrugs* Rules are rules, I guess.

It's a small place with signage only in Thai (from what I could tell), so it's possible to walk by without realizing it. Once inside, it's a little bigger than expected, but not by much. The tables are set up quite close to one another with little stools instead of full-sized chairs. I mention this because if you are a person on the larger side, I can imagine you'd have a pretty hard time fitting yourself comfortably at a table on the seat. I ended up squeezing in behind another group of girls who decided to put all their stuff behind them (aka my only possible space to sit) and I was ok, but it was tight. I passive-aggressively eyeballed the blonde girl who stuck her entire LL Bean knapsack under my stool until she shoved it under her own.

Note to people like that: Nana's has an area with hooks to hang your jacket, scarves, ginormous camping equipment, etc so please USE IT. Your fellow diners will appreciate it greatly.

Ok, so the food. This is a fun little place to get pretty good Thai food. I've only been there once, so I can't speak for overall consistency, but all the meals we had at our table were delicious. We all started off with the Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp -- so good! It was exactly the thing you need coming in from the cold, and with a little kick of spice to get things started. It's also surprisingly satisfying despite coming in a small bowl.

I ordered the Khao Soi Chicken, which was an egg noodle dish with fried dark meat and crispy noodles and lemongrass on top in a delicious broth. It was a super filling dish and I probably could've taken home my leftovers to pour over plain rice for an additional meal. At our table, we also ordered the yellow curry chicken with rice, Pad See Ew with Beef, some kind of fried rice dish with chicken (can't recall the name, sorry!), and the Pad Thai with Pork. Be sure to note the spiciness of dishes you order - there are no take-backs if you're a wimp!

We ended with two desserts: a milk roti and a 'special' roti (it's got a secret ingredient...I'm sure you'll have a clue once you taste it, but it is totally delicious!) Both were very tasty, although I'd recommend the special roti slightly more. Both come with condensed milk which is basically all I needed to hear before slapping down the menu and salivating profusely.

The service was pretty decent. Our waitress was very kind and quick, and answered all our questions about ingredients, etc.

 

tldr; the food is good, the waitstaff are good, the seating is bad."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the service is atrocious. Last time I came it was for a quick early dinner and it was just before service begin. We were seated then told \"we're opening in 3 minutes\" totally unnecessary if they had just brought water instead. Our server never came by to ask how our meal was, and when she came for the bill, just plunked it Dow and walked away. At least  a different server was pretty diligent with water refills. One of the owners  (shorter gentlement with black plastic glasses) is always gracious at the end of the meal, but for the prices Nana charges they shouldn't cheep out on the day care centre style seating and they should invest in wireless debit machines.

The previous time we were seated then told we may have to be moved later, or have strangers join our table. Unheard of."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food. And Khao San Road is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. So, we decided to try Nana as it's their sister restaurant.
The food was okay. 
The seating arrangement was horrible. The tables were tiny, and you have to sit plastic stools. The cutlery is cheap too.
The portions are small and pretty expensive for the price.
Their menu is not as big/diverse as Khao San road either. If you need to make a trip to the washroom, you'll need to be very careful to walk sideways so not to bump people sitting in the way, the place is so cramped."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a decent Thai joint on Queen St. but this one wasn't for me. The food was meh and too oily (check pictures) and the service was slow and disengaged. I did appreciate the authentic decor and the buzzing energy of the casual restaurant, but it's not a place that will satisfy my Thai cravings."}
{"text":"Every time I walk by this place, it is always packed full of people, so one Sunday night I decided to try it out. It being late on a Sunday almost all of the appetizers were sold out (even spring rolls and fresh rolls) and a signature cocktail was sold out? I ordered a green curry and Tom yum soup. There was a ton of lemongrass (I think) and it was hard like wood chips, I had to pick though both dishes of what looked like hardened something, I couldn't finish my meal. Only positive I can say was that the server was very nice."}
{"text":"Simply put, there are much better options for Thai food in the neighborhood.  We ignored the blah reviews of the place and decided to chance it just because we were craving Thai and happen to be in the area.  I ordered their signature Pad Thai and the size of the dish was fairly small compared to all the other Thai places.  Now considering the fact that their Pad Thai dish is 20% more expensive than the others, it's clearly overpriced for the quantity and quality.  I should also point out that my date and I both got sick the next day with this meal as the only common element."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with 2 friends last night. Two of us are vegetarians. There's not a ton of veg options but still good selection - there's one veg app (king oyster mushroom salad) and several types of curry for mains. 

We started with cocktails, which were all fantastic. I had one with bourbon, egg white, tamarind and a few other ingredients that I now forget, but it was sweet and spicy and refreshing all at once. 

I had yellow curry fried rice, which was love at first bite. So flavorful with crunchy toasted coconut shavings. My other veg friend has the green curry, which was also a hit. We shared the coconut gelato and thai roti for dessert (kind of like a crepe, with condensed milk and chocolate). 

Everything was delicious and the servers were friendly without being overly intrusive. The owner came by at the end of the meal to see how everything was, and seemed genuinely interested to hear our feedback. 

The atmosphere is really fun and casual - you really do feel like you're transported to another place - colorful flags hanging from the ceiling, beautiful green painted shutters on the walls, adorable pastel plates. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent cooking skills!
Chicken laab is amazing, a must try.
I also had the pork and crab spring rolls which were great and then my favourite thai dish, pad thai.

The restaurant was busy when we got there at 7 they said it would be half an hour before a table opened, we left our number, went across the road for a drink and within 10 minutes she phoned us with an opening. It was busy all night though. We were one of the slowest tables, we didnt leave till 9.30 and every table was taken and people were still queueing to get in.

If your not a fan of small spaces get a seat at the bar, the tables are not very wide, but its supposed to be thai street food, which is why they just have little tables and stools. The kitchen is so fast you can be in and out in half an hour. We just took long finishing all the cocktails, i forget what mine was called, a jukata.... Something or other but it had gin, lime, lemon, agave, soda and thai basil. Delish!

Ive also done khao san road and they are just as good. The squash frites are to die for"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood, and this is a regular spot in my dining out rotation. 

I have never had anything here I didn't like. 

My favourite starts are the mushroom laab and green papaya salad. Both are super spicy, fresh, and DELICIOUS! 

Cocktails are pricey but well made and unique; for as often as I go, I prefer to keep it cheap & cheerful with a bottle of Singa Beer. 

I don't eat meat, but there's lots of vegetarian (vegan, pescetarian, etc) options. Pad See Ew is my favourite, but I love each curry they make, too. 

They're not into modifying a lot of the dishes. Love it or leave it. But they TOTALLY know what they're doing. And many people say this is some of the MOST authentic Thai food outside of Thailand. Not a bad claim. 

I can't totally speak to authenticity without ever having been to Thailand, but man this food has got heart. So if the kitchen needs to protect the integrity of their dishes by drawing a deep line in the 'modification' sand, so be it. It's the kind of plates that come out and these seemingly small bowls deliver what feels like a never ending portion of delicious layers, flavour, and textures that have clearly been made with so much love. 

Service is consistently good, the owner's often there asking people how they've enjoyed their meal, and you can't beat the classic 90's hip hop that adds a lot of fun to the whole vibe. Yes. It's communal seating. So if you don't like communal seating, then take out may be a better opportunity for you to truly appreciate the food. I've never been sat with terrible people - some chat, some don't, (just read the signs and take cues) - but I always imagine I'm in a night market in Thailand and the vibe feels fun and right. And delicious. Oh so, so, so delicious."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I echo Sean S.'s 2-star review (10/15/2015) on the tightness of the space, the loudness, the small portions, and the unreasonably high prices for what you get. We only went here because Nana appeared on Chris Nuttall-Smith's summary of best restaurants of the year. Oh, how I wish my husband hadn't read that! I should have known what to expect when making plans to go to an over-hyped restaurant on Queen West.

* The Food *
- tom yum soup with shrimp, $6: as expected--nothing special
- fresh rolls with pork, $8: just average, but not spectacular for $8! They were cut up, but I believe that was $8 for just 2 rolls.
- khao soi with chicken, $15: as someone else noted here, this was tasty, but a bit too salty.
- mi ga ti with pork, $15: the peanut flavour was too strong. No subtlety here.
- banana roti for dessert ($6): This was the one really good item from our dinner, with a nice, crisp roti and simple, not-too-sweet flavour. A good alternative to the fried banana that appears on Vietnamese menus. However, one shouldn't have to drop over $100 for two for a mediocre dinner and drinks, just to get to the dessert.

* The Service *
Nothing to complain about, but nothing spectacular either. Food came at a leisurely pace.

* The Ambience:
See above notes about crowded shared tables, tight space between tables, and overall loudness. Some reviewers may like the \"boisterous\" atmosphere akin to a Bangkok street. But I imagine that I wouldn't be spending this much to eat Thai street food, so I prefer a relatively calm dining experience for my $$$.

* The Value *
As other people here have noted, paying $15 for a main at a \"street food\" place should either be spectacular or be decently portioned (hey, I just had a thought: how about both?). I ended up snacking once we got home. I guess I should have had an idea of the profit margin of this place when reading the description of the pad mama sai sai kok (pad mama with hot dog, or the \"mac 'n cheese\" of Thailand). Kudos to the owner at least for not hiding the fact that this \"comforting dish\" consists of ***instant noodles, hot dog, and the seasoning pack***! Other Asian restaurants I know of that use *instant noodle packs* wouldn't think of charging $15. Sure, $7 or $8, because that's reasonable. Not at Nana.

Overall Experience:
If you enjoy rubbing elbows (literally) with the coolest kids of Queen West and paying a price for it, then congrats! You've found just the right place! Never again for us. If, however, you want to stay in the same neighbourhood and have very good, reasonably-priced Thai food, try Coco Rice at King & Bathurst. I really, really wish I had spoken up and expressed that desire to my husband when he told me that we'd be going to Nana. Live and learn."}
{"text":"The food at Nana is great, but when ordering take-away it's almost always not warm enough to the point of being cool. Microwaving it makes it soggy and unappetizing. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I adore the Thai street food style setup.  Brings you across the ocean to local Thailand.

Good wise is not bad, the Pad See Ew is a bit too salty.  Absolutely surprise with the authentic Tom Yum Soup.   Ordered the chicken satay and they are grilled perfectly, the meat are tender and juicy, only a bit over price.

I would come back and try their other food on the menu!  like!!!"}
{"text":"I had the mi ga ti with pork (red curry with vermicelli). In hindsight, my friend and I should have ordered small dishes from their appetizer menu.

Wins: great flavours; good portion of bean sprouts/pork/tofu; great decor/location

Things that could use improvement: $15 is the standard 'flat rate' for all their dishes, which I found a bit much for the portion of noodles given."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best food on West Queen West,  although our orders are typically weighted towards  the Khao San Road menu items that are offered."}
{"text":"The host and servers at Nana are some of the most patient people in the restaurant industry! 

On a friday night around 8 pm, three of us ventured to Nana. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table, which turned into us showing up 30 minutes after and they had held our table for us. We then promptly became more annoying by requesting a table for 4 as we had a friend who wanted to join us. At this point, if I were a hostess, I would have been mega annoyed but they were very kind and moved us when a table became available. 

While we were waiting for the 4th friend, I felt terribly bad that we hadn't ordered anything so I requested the laab kai tod - southern fried chicken salad - to start. Now this is my kind of salad! Small tender pieces of perfectly seasoned fried chicken served with shallots and chilli and lime - it was honestly delectable. 

I was intrigued by the pad mama sai sai kok - instant noodles with hot dogs, but our server discreetly told me to go with something else (she felt that the price wasn't worth being served instant noodles) pad prik king kai - chicken stir fried in a dry red curry paste. Very, very good with a wonderful heat to it!

Everyone loved their food and the service was impeccable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now and love the food. I've had the Phad Thai, Khao Soi and yellow curry fried rice, as well as both the fresh and spring rolls as starters. Every item was delicious. The spot is little, so I'd recommend keeping it to dinners for 2-4. Very nice and attentive staff too."}
{"text":"Nana is known to be the sister restaurant of Khao San Road (one of my downtown favs). But all in all, I wasn't too amazed by its food and service comparatively based on several reasons.

I came as a group of six without reservations on a Friday night. They apparently take reservations made 24 hours prior only. So our first time around, we waited for an hour and still no table available, part reason was the requirement that the entire party must be there to be seated. We gave up and went to a restaurant nearby instead. Second time around, the wait was still bearable and we ended up getting seated in an hour, again.

Based on size, Nana is much smaller than its sister yet more hipster. The have that ??? (dai pai dong) Asian layout where the chairs are colourful, round and plastic. The walls are also covered in retro posters and artworks, alongside their simple menu. Majority of us ordered the same main dishes including the khao soi kai, mi ga ti moo, and khao pad pong kra ree.

For myself, I tried the Khao Soi Kai. It's an egg noodle dish mixed in golden curry coconut broth, which also comes with crispy dark meat chicken cutlets on the side. It's topped with cilantro, bean sprouts, onion, and a slice of lime. I felt the bowl didn't have enough noodles to be entirely filling. Nevertheless, the sauce was just right - not too sweet nor too spicy. The soup base wasn't too thick and didn't make me too thirsty or bloated. I had some previously that could give a bad aftermath feeling.

As for the Mi Ga Ti Moo, the texture and visualization is similar to my Khao Soi but its soup base is much sweeter. This dish apparently uses thin rice noodles mixed with red curry, coconut, bean sprouts, tofu and sweet basil which perhaps gave it the sweeter flavour.

Service was mediocre as our water wasn't always refilled given the spicy dishes. I also find the seat spacing more squishy and it would be tough during winter to put everything down (coats, bags). Near the end of the meal, they were pretty quick to rush us with the bill as our table is cleared as well. Overall its not much of a service yet they charge an automatic 18% gratuity on top of your bill. I find the Nana's food is a bit too expensive for its value."}
{"text":"The food was very good- had the mi ga ti with pork for $15 and I would order it again. The banana roti desert was a disappointment. Skip the cocktails however; while decent, they do not compliment the meal at all. Get a Chang beer instead."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to come here, the food is amazing and the owners are always nice. This is the sister restaurant of Kaho San Road, what I believe to be the nexus of all this Thai Food hype in Toronto.

Must Try:

Thai Boat Noodles- Truly a provocative bowl of soup which introduced flavors my pallet has never tasted before. Dark rich and complex broth thickened with cows blood plus the abundance of 5 different types of beef really makes this dish unforgettable.

Chicken Grad Pao- There is a friend chicken frenzy in the Toronto food scene and these little nuggets of chicken are an explosion of flavor which will not cease to impress. 

The reason why I give it 4 stars is simply because the price you pay is a premium, and having been to Thailand the decor reminds one of street vendors and open markets, but the price does not."}
{"text":"So I booked a reservation here and was told it was confirmed. I went to see a movie before my reservation and when I got out I had four missed calls and several messages from the restaurant trying to get in touch with me. The final message stated that my reservation was to be canceled despite us walking there.

When I finally got a chance to call I was told there would be no problem, but when I arrived I was lectured by the man there who told me he tried to call and that I \"should've called back\". I explained the situation but he barely listened. They then seated us at a table with a couple who just sat down.

We left at that point so I have no comment on the food, just crappy service. Be aware that if you make a reservation here you're expected to answer their calls within hours of your reservation or it'll be canceled."}
{"text":"Well so after hearing that it's a sister restaurant of Khao Sao Road, I went here as I really like khao Sao road food..the seating is totally uncomfortable but the servers are amazing.:the food is mediocre at best but the portion size are good enough..it's not that pricey but compared to what food tastes like I would say you are better off going to Khao Sao Road or Sukho Thai.."}
{"text":"I think a great Thai place is hard to find and I was certainly impressed with Nana. They were serving their Khao San Road dinner menu and I ordered the penang beef (my measure of a good Thai place is the excellence of their curries). The penang was not quite as coconutty as other places however it was just as delicious. Good vibe and friendly service."}
{"text":"I thought the papaya salad was divinely blazing hot, great start. The Pad See Ew was warm and garlicky with perfectly cooked noodles and the Pad Thai was OK. 

You're probably going to eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers here...it's loud and cramped...I'd probably like it more if I was feeling rowdy."}
{"text":"i went there last sunday, it was my first time there. their tom yum soup was very delicious and the pad thai was great. it was better than i expected."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5

Arrived Friday night when they opened at 6pm and by 7pm, the restaurant was almost full but no line ups.
We ordered the green curry chicken and pad thai. I really enjoyed the pad thai, it was so fragrant and I loved how it came with a variety of hot sauces to choose from. The green curry was good too, but too much mint leaves for me. Definitely prefer Nana's pad thai, but khao san's green curry. (Pai still wins on the green curry out of the 3) The thai iced tea was good too, but tasted the same as khao san and pai.

Our service was mixed between a really sweet waitress and a not-too-pleasant one, but overall it was fine.

The decor and 'furniture' aka plastic stools brought me back to the streets of Thailand, so I loved it! But I can see how it could be uncomfortable for some.

Will be back for the pad thai!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic meal. I saw others complain about the set up, but I had no issues. Stools were comfortable, shared table didn't feel crowded at all. Place was packed and had a fun, lively vibe.

Chicken laab app - spectacular. Like, its been 3 days and I'm still thinking about it. It was sweet and salty and sour, but not saucy or greasy. Limey. Great.

Beef Red curry - comes with white rice, little cubes of butternut squash and the beef was tender. The whole thing was spectacular. 

Last dish was ordered by my dinner mate, and i missed the name, but it was noodles and chicken and peanut sauce and maybe shallots? So so good. 

Service was also excellent. Guy who I think was the manager super friendly and checked in with us a few times.

Will be back for sure. Wish they were open for lunch, I'd go every day."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Nana Saturday while shopping in the Queen West area and being a Thai-food lover, was surprised I haven't read about Khao San Road's sister restaurant.  There were two tables left at 6:30pm and we were asked if two of us minded sharing a communal table for four or sitting at the bar, we opted for the former.  No issues bumping elbows or anything, there was plenty of space for both parties.

The decor is full of colourful street art and service was prompt (15 minute wait for entrees and drink served within 5 minutes).  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea  (practically tastes the same as KSR and Sukho Thai), Pad Thai Bolan (means \"authentic\") and Yellow Curry with coconut.  While none of the dishes we ordered were spicy, they provide a spice rack of four different iterations of chilis/chili sauce for you to flavour dishes yourself.  I quite enjoyed this as it allowed you to blend as much or as little as you wanted.

The Pad Thai with Beef was a little salty for my liking but the portion size was spot on - I find at other Thai establishments I can never finish a Pad Thai but I was definitely perfectly satiated here.   The Yellow Curry with coconut had great flavour - the coconut milk underbase was not particularly overwhelming but just right, and both dishes with a bit of chili made for a great meal.  Didn't really have room for dessert but after reading promising things on Thai Iced Tea gelato, will definitely come back for it. 

Overall my experience was not plagued by service issues as others have noted, but the food here as compared to Sukho Thai or Khao San Road is not extraordinary enough to entice me to venture further west into this area.  If you're ever around after a day of shopping, give Nana a try!"}
{"text":"I came with a group where the menu was already pre-selected in advance in order to save time and we all shared family style in the end.  

We had a wide variety of dishes from papaya salad, 2 different kinds of noodles, fried rice, pork rolls, pork on rice, fried chicken and some I forget having and some I didn't even get to take photos of so I could remember.  The bottom line is the dishes aren't very large but they are very good.  The portions are not huge but they are flavorful.  

My absolute favorite dish was the fried chicken which was breaded and while spicy was amazingly flavorful.

I was told by somebody who I would never question that this was authentic Thai food.  Overall this was one of the best Thai experiences I can say I've had in recent memory.  On the table there is a carrying holder for 4 different kinds of chili to spice up your dishes if they aren't already hot enough for you.  I enjoyed the fresh finely chopped peppers while the other 3 were 2 different kinds of dry and a wet pepper sauce.

The place is very tight inside and tables are few but we saw seating at the bar at capacity.  There was a line to get in as well I suppose because the place is so popular.  Still, I was more than happy of the food we had all had a chance to try and the variety we were able to get with such a group.  

I'd come back here for the chicken alone considering I've been consuming copious quantities of Korean fried chicken lately this fried chicken here with Thai seasoning is VERY good."}
{"text":"Kudos to the street vibe of Thailand. Every bowl, table, waiters and waitresses feels like you were teleport to Thailand. We had high expectation as it's a sister restaurant to Khao San Road. Maybe that's unfair right from the start. 

The food though is where it fall short. The only stand out was 'pad thai mama', the flavours are comforting and interesting. Something you wish you have for any or all of your future drunk food. 
All the food had big bold flavours, and for the first 5 bites you will be in Thai heaven, however, it quickly becomes overbearing and lack lusting. 
Overall I would still recommend coming here if you want an interesting dining experience, just maybe once."}
{"text":"When I got to Nana just after 6 p.m., there were a few tables available.  I was the first one there and unfortunately the hostess wouldn't give me a table until all of my friends were there.  That was fine with me and I waited at the entrance for my friends.  

The interior decor of this restaurant deserves a lot of recognition!  It was definitely designed to resemble the streets of Bangkok.  There were colourful flags stretched across the restaurant, walls that had \"shuttered windows\", and tables and chairs that resembled the ones that you sit outside on the streets (a lot of Asian countries have these) -- the chairs were the plastic sort.  I really loved the feel of the restaurant.

I ordered the \"Pad Mama with Hot Dog\" (Pad Mama Sai Sai Kok).  According to their menu, it said that \"this is the 'mac 'n cheese' of Thailand, a comforting dish of tasty stir-fried instant noodles with vegetables, oyster sauce, sweet soy & hot dogs (the mama 'tom yum' seasoning pack is added back in for good pressure).\"

It didn't take too long for the dishes to arrive together.  On the table, there was a spread of four different types of spicy sauce and peppers in open containers too.  I tried these out for \"good measure\".

I really liked my Pad Mama with Hot Dog dish!  It was really just fried instant noodles (the mama brand) but it was fried with Thai spices and had a hint of tanginess to it (probably from the lime juice that I squeezed in).  It was really a unique dish made with common ingredients.  The spices were indeed \"authentic\" (as much as I could taste it anyway) and I really liked the noodles!  The hot dog was also nothing special -- plain hot dogs -- but they were cut up so that their ends split up like an octopus.  Again, this was definitely a comfort food dish. 

I tried a bite of the Pad Thai Bo Lan from T and that single bite was full of flavour and authentic tastes again.  I was impressed!

I tried the Yellow Curry Fried Rice with Coconut and liked the yellow curry in the rice.  It wasn't too spicy either.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Nana Restaurant and wish I could have tried more of their dishes.  This is the type of restaurant that you will want to come into with a group of four to five foodies and share all of the dishes because everything is so flavourful and authentic."}
{"text":"Really nice, lively crowd at Nana - plastic seats, very loud, but enjoyable (to us). The food is definitely not as good as Khao San's. Not much else to say - we had the tom yum soup and wished it had more flavour . The beef noodle soup was very interesting. Pad thai was my favourite. Chicken curry and beef skewers were good. 
I would not wait in a long line for this food, but I would go again if in the area.
Cannot wait for the new Khao San location to open!"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the food here at all.
The taste of the dishes were very underwhelming. 
The three of us couldn't even finish the mushroom salad it was so unappetizing, especially the crunchy bits of dirt that were left due to lack of washing the mushrooms properly. 
The Kao soi was disappointing as I felt it didn't have much flavour and the crispy bits on top tasted funny.
The massaman curry was unlike any massaman curry I've ever had. It resembled more of a sweet and sour/BBQ sauce flavour and texture to it rather than the yellow curry dish I am used to. 
The proportions vs. price are way off as well. All in all super disappointed :( We were all so excited to finally come and try this place."}
{"text":"After having spent months spoofing Torontonians with potential concepts such as God Bless 'Merica, Cakehole and New Delhi Burgers, this Queen West joint finally revealed itself to be Nana, Monte Wan (Khao San Road)'s newest venture.

Khao San Road, along with the Sukho Thai were the pioneers in elevating Thai cuisine beyond your ketchup-y, chain-quality pad thai.  So naturally, Wan is sticking to what he does best.

The decor is reminiscent of the streets of Bangkok, with the Thai flag and various bright-colored banners hanging above.  The restaurant seats about 30-35, mostly communal tables and a few seats at the bar.

The cocktail menu was crafted by Bevlab and are Thai-inspired versions of your classics like the Jatujjak \"jin & juice.\"  Most of the descriptions lead me to believe they would all be syrupy concoctions, of the Karaoke bar-variety so I ask the server for the least sugar-laced one.

He suggests the Bang Rak ($12), a star anise-infused vodka concoction with ginger syrup, lychee nectar and grapefruit bitters.  The drink arrives at the table and perhaps my alcohol tolerance is just higher than others, but it still errs on the side of sweet and if it's the strongest drink they've got - I'm going to need a few more.  Despite that, it's a delicious drink.  But the Chang lager is just as good a bet, and wonderfully refreshing.  Added bonus?  It's only $6.

Similar menu offerings from Khao San Road are seen, such as the khao soi, albeit the Nana iteration subs chicken for beef.  There's pad Thai bolan, and when prompted as to what bolan means, our server tells us it simply means \"authentic.\"

We order the Southern fried chicken laab ($12) to start, an offering straight out of KFC Thailand's books.  It's similar to Taiwanese popcorn chicken and I absolutely love the different combination of sweet and salty with citrus notes as well.

We then order the fresh rolls with pork ($8) which are not as refreshing as their Vietnamese counterpart.  The rice paper is double-layered, the presentation more sushi than fresh roll.  I preferred the rolls better sans dipping sauce as it allowed you to actually taste the spices in the pork.

For our mains we skip over the khao soi and red and yellow curries and opt for the Chef Top's fried rice ($16) with chicken, topped with a crispy fried egg and a side of fish sauce.  The addition of basil really does add a bit more oomph to an otherwise pedestrian plate of fried rice.

We also opt for the mi ga ti with pork ($15), a peanut and coconut milk based curry that reminds me of everything I don't like about restaurant Thai food - the broth is too sweet.  The coconut milk drowns out any potential peanut flavoring to be had and as I ladle spoonfuls of the curry into my mouth, I can't help but think of the che dau that my grandmother used to make at home (a Vietnamese dessert of glutinous rice and black eyed beans doused with a generous ladle of coconut cream).

The dishes we order aren't particular spicy, but there was a tray of chilies in all their different iterations available - fresh, dried, fried and in vinegar.

We ask the staff what the \"Special\"roti ($8) is, but are denied any explanation beyond \"I'm sworn to secrecy but I can promise you that it's good and that you'll like it.\"  He'll have to add this deception to his list of laundry items at his next confession as we are sorely disappointed.

The saltiness of the roti dominates and the little bit of condensed milk drizzle fails to save the day.  If only the seasoning of the mi ga ti pork and the dessert roti could've been reversed...  The server comes back to ask us if we liked his recommendation, we tell him \"unfortunately not.\"  Oh well, at least we know a portion of the proceeds will go to Meal Share.

The much better bet is to go for the Thai tea gelato ($5).  You get three scoops and its definitely not as sugary as the actual drink itself.  While I am normally disappointed by tea-based desserts as they seldom pack in enough tea flavor - this one did not let me down.

There were a few hits (mainly the chicken laab and the Thai tea gelato).  But I still prefer Khao San Road - even if it means having to wait in line."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great little spot with a fun, casual atmosphere. Also love that as long as you avoid the peak dinner hours there is very little wait for a table. Delicious Thai food. We love the pad thai bolen and the mi ga ti is also delicious. The portions are a big smaller than typical Thai fare, so be prepared to order an extra main or a few app's to share. Family friendly: Would be on okay spot for older kids but not toddlers as seating is stool seating. Tight downtown spot and carriers would be preferred to strollers."}
{"text":"It was busy, it was bustling, and it was Thai. That settled that -- we decided to go in and eat there. We had to wait for a few minutes and then were seated on a small table, crowded in on both sides.

Sold! In my mind, I imagine eating out in Thailand is similar. Busy street market restaurant. Squeeze in where you can. While I will say that the seats are a bit low and it's hard to avoid brushing against your new dining neighbours when getting to and from your seat, I did not mind so much. It's great for people watchers! However, not everyone is cool with this type of seating. Nor were some of our dining neighbours happy with the wait (from ordering to receiving their meals).

We didn't have such a bad time of it. We did have to wait a bit for our food to come out but I found the service to be friendly and helpful if not the most attentive. Naturally they are too busy to keep check up on you regularly, however, my partner has a crustacean allergy and they made sure nothing we ordered would be a problem for him. He found the chicken pad Thai to be okay, nothing too special. I did enjoy the southern fried chicken. It's an app, and I wasn't feeling hungry enough for a main. There's a sizable amount of chicken that comes in the dish. Although I do not fault the servers for being busy and less attentive than other places, I did dock a star because it took us forever to get the bill. Which is irregular, considering how packed they are.

Otherwise, I think this place is pretty cool. It sells the vibe well. The food is good. Neither dish was a standout for me, but still good. And it's in the stretch of Queen West that's pretty happening, especially in the warmer months. It def brings some variety to the street."}
{"text":"This place was ok but nothing to get excited about. I was really expecting more based on all the \"best of\" recommendations it has. My green curry was average. I've had way better at other restaurants. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything I'd feel I'd want to have more of, especially considering the price. The portion also seemed smaller than other restaurants' green curries. My partner and I both left still feeling hungry.  The seating is cramped and communal and because there are coat hooks behind certain seats I had to sit with some guy's puffy winter coat sitting pressed into my back. I needed to lean forward at a 40 degree angle the whole time, there was just no room to sit upright. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"For what you get (quantity and quality), it's darn expensive! 

First of all, I'm a stickler when in comes to a restaurant's profit margin. I'm all for everyone making a fair living, but the cost of Thai food is such that I felt fleeced paying in excess of $100 for our meal (4 entrées and one appetizer). 

Our chicken stick was luke warm. I'll tolerate that, but have a tough time accepting it as our table was second from the kitchen. The quantity was just lacking. Won't order again. 

The entrées were portion controlled. Unfortunately, the flavours were not to my standards. [I had to supplement this meal with another meal afterwards ] 

If you're out on a date, looking for a clean place with an interesting ambiance, and not adverse to paying, then you've found a place. I for one, will continue searching, and save my desire for Thai food when I visit Thailand."}
{"text":"Ordered Uber eats from khao San road, Yelp redirected to here. 
Hands down best Thai food I've had in Toronto!
Pad see ew was tasty and fresh even out of the plastic container. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my worst experience when it comes to Thai food. And trust me, I know Thai food. I lived in Bangkok for a year. We ordered pad see ew, Thai yellow curry fried rice and khao soi with chicken. All lousy! I would not return to this restaurant even they offered to give me a free meal!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations because of our great experiences at Khao San Road. Sadly, we were very disappointed. Our night started out with being crammed into very very tight uncomfortable seats at a shared table. There were 2 open tables at the back which we were told we weren't allowed to sit at - there was a person who looked like the manager or owner just hanging out on their laptop there...but there were about 8 open seats! Menus were old and crumply with food stains. Next our server forgot to bring our beer. Food was ok - for an appetizer we ordered the chicken laad which although was on the very salty side, ended up being the best part of our meal. We originally tried ordering spring rolls and fresh rolls which were both sold out. For our meals, I ordered the tofu pad gra prao and my boyfriend ordered the fried rice pad gra prao - both were so so, oily, relatively tasty, but nothing special - average at best.  Also all the dishes were served on plastic plates, which I thought was a bit tacky. Our bill was about $55, which was a lot in our opinions for so so food, plastic plates, and poor service. All in all, not a great experience and won't be back.  Save your $ and head to Khao San Road instead."}
{"text":"Pros:
Amazing authentic Thai food. I've been to several cities in Thailand and most of the restaurants in Toronto don't even come close :( HIGHLY recommend the pad see ew. ITS REALLY GOOD, order it if you like noodles!!

Cons:
Really crowded environment, not the most comfortable, kind of loud 

For a casual meal I'd highhhhly recommend this place, the food is honestly really good. But for a date or a relaxing environment, this is not the place"}
{"text":"Nana is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Toronto. Tables, plastic chairs, dishes, and utensils are exactly look alike what we use at street food stalls in Bangkok. The food tastes really Thai. Papaya salad (som tum) is the best of Thai salad in this city I have ever tried. Southern fried chicken (Laab Khai Tod) and Green curry are also excellent.Don't forget to ask for dessert despite no dessert menu. If you are lucky enough you can get special one ,sweet sticky rice with mango."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Nana and have eaten there a number of times. The restaurant is small and the vibe is loud which I enjoy. I have samples a few different dishes on the menu but always seem to end up getting the Khao Soi and adding a little bit of roasted chilli to bump up the spice level.

The Khao Soi is the perfect amount of food for me, but some of the other dishes are a little smaller. I would suggest getting an appetizer to share if you are very hungry."}
{"text":"Decent food, awful service. Won't be seated until your whole party arrives (table given away otherwise). 

Was told the reason for this is so food arrives at the same time. Only problem is that couldn't have been further from the truth....

3/4 beers arrived together, remaining 1 took an additional 10 mins before informing us they didn't have it in stock. Same thing for food, 2 mains arrived at the same time, next 10 minutes after. Last one only arrived after all other 3 diners were finished eating.

Cute ambiance, reminds me of Thailand. Having said that the plastic stools get pretty uncomfortable - however maybe this is the owner's cunning plan to increase customer turnover! :)"}
{"text":"I recently came back from Thailand and was craving some thai food, I decided on Nana after reading some positive reviews. 

I ordered the moo ping grilled pork skewers for appetizer, they were juicy and flavourful.

For the main course, I ordered the khao soi with chicken, so good, but a little too spicy for my liking. 

Lastly, my favourite course - dessert! I ordered the banana pancakes with condensed milk, and of course it was amazingggg. 

Overall the food is quite authentic, on par with what I ate in Thailand. Price - $30-$40/pp (literally 5x's more than what i paid for in Thailand, sigh) BUT I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I met 3 friends at Nana. The fourth was running late, but they seated us anyway. When the 4th person showed up 10 minutes later, they argued with her at the door about not allowing separate seating times and almost didn't let her in. 

They do NOT accommodate allergies or dietary restrictions like at khao san road because the chef refuses to alter any dishes. If you are a vegetarian, the chef will not leave out fish or oyster sauce from any of the dishes, so you have a single option on the menu, and it is really spicy. 

The decor is really cute. I feel like I'm in a trendy backpacker street booth in Thailand. However, I would prefer cushions on the chair. If my ass is going to hurt after my meal from sitting on plastic stools, I expect the cost of my meal to reflect that, and $15 mains and $12 cocktails just don't match up with those expectations. 

The food is delicious, however, which earned it two stars."}
{"text":"We decided to go check out Nana after receiving the devastating news that Khao San Road is temporarily closed. According to Khao San Road's website, Nana is their short term location for lunches Monday-Saturday and dinners Monday & Tuesday. We came on a Wednesday night, so the menu was Nana's.  

We got the vegan green curry and the vegan pad Thai. The curry was very rich and had a unique, strong lemongrass flavour which was delicious. The pad Thai noodles had the right amount of chew and the sauce was perfectly tart. However, when ordering, we were never asked how spicy we wanted our dishes. At Khao San Road (and most other Thai restaurants really), they always ask us for spice preference. So our dishes were too mild for our liking unfortunately.. But they do have 4 kinds of chilli pastes/flakes at the table for you to add to the dish. I do have to say the portions were a little small though.. For $15 a dish, I definitely didn't get my money's worth. For comparison, their pad Thai is equivalent to half of what you get at Salad King (which is only $10 by the way). So definitely not a bang for your buck, but pretty dang delicious (just remember to ask about spice level!). 

Where Nana falls short is on the service side. We ordered around 6:20 pm and didn't receive our food until 6:50 pm. It also didn't help that we were really freaking hungry.. the wait for our food took what felt like eons. Also, our water was not refilled when our glasses were empty. I felt like the mediocre service and long wait really spoiled my experience at Nana, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Was yum! We went to Nana recently when it was serving its Khao San Road dinner menu (as they are bunking in together while KSR moves to a new location). Overall the group I was with was very happy! We had the 3 flavour pad thai, panang beef, and massaman tofu. All very good flavour and you could let it was freshly made, and made with care. Prices reasonable and average.

I always debate rating places I really like a 4 or a 5 and 5 is quite steep, but I would definitely come back, I liked the interior colours and service, and I really liked the food! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before we decided to eat here.  Completely over priced for the amount of food.  The food is decent but it was portioned for a child.  It also took a long time for our food to come so don't come starving because you will probably pass out before you get your food.  So now we are heading to banhmi boys to actually get full."}
{"text":"Been coming to Nana for a few years, just feel like quality of food is going downhill. 
Ma Ga Ti - too salty & the noodles were so soft, it would just break when you work in it (probably boiled for too long)
Pad see ew - Salty. The chinese broccoli very bitter. Massaman Curry - Too sour. Didnt finish it. Only good dishes are the appetizers & fried rice. 
Pad Thai - mediocre. 
Expensive & small portions! 
Service is good."}
{"text":"I decided on Nana this evening because I wanted to show my boyfriend who recently moved to Toronto from England some really wonderful Thai food.  I had been to Khao San Road and Nana before and since we were early enough to avoid the huge rush and not so far from Nana I figured it was a pretty good opportunity regardless of it being a Friday night.  Needless to say, the food was delicious but our experience was more than enough to unsettle my (and my partner's) stomach.

Soon after arriving we were greeted by the most lovely staff.  Even though we arrived a bit after 7 the only intimate space available in the restaurant was at the bar, which in itself was great.  We conversed over a cocktail and beer and waited for our delicious food.

All that was great until I noticed one very large, glaring detail; while chatting happily to one another (and rather excitedly, as my partner was rather hungry and really enjoys a decent Thai meal) we noticed that the man who was managing the influx of customers at the door happened to be groping the female staff behind the bar counter whenever he walked by to grab any one of the several alcoholic drinks he consumed over the course of our single drinks and shared double plates.  

For a moment I filed his handsiness in the back of my mind thinking perhaps he was just a kinesthetic person and expressed his appreciation in a rather touchy-feely type way.  The female staff were rather uncomfortable with him grabbing them at their waist and buttocks and there was no argument about whether or not it was an abuse of power.

I made no qualms about expressing my unhappiness that this man was groping the wait staff behind the counter, making eye contact numerous times which made it clear I didn't find it appropriate, but he didn't seem to particularly care. 

As my partner and I were about to exit the restaurant I did ask the man to share his name with me, to which he replied happily and unapologetically with his name, [redacted due to Yelp reviewer policy guidelines].  In that moment I realized he was the owner of both Khao San Road and Nana and that in all likelihood, this is how he feels he should be allowed to treat his female wait staff.

Neither I nor my boyfriend will be returning to Nana or its parent restaurant, Khao San Road.  There isn't much I can do in regards to how the owner [redacted due to Yelp reviewer policy guidelines] chooses to behave towards his female employees but I do hope that despite the risk of losing their job, they do have an opportunity to address any potential discomfort they experience. Unfortunately, I don't think this is the case."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with both the food and the service. The server was very friendly, very attentive and made me feel very welcome right away. She answered my questions about the menu and was very knowledgeable.She asked if I had any allergies  which was thoughtful. She was prompt about bringing water, checked on me two minutes after my food arrived and refilled my glass . Very professional. 
I ordered the red curry with vegetables and tofu with steamed rice. It was lovely- spicy and warm and perfect on a cold winter day. The curry was rich and fragrant and the tofu was not overlooked. For $15 the portion was generous.
The vibe of the restaurant was pretty crowded and loud, but it was in a fun, vibrant , exciting way and not annoying.
Overall id definitely go back and try more 
menu items. The food that I saw other people eating looked so good! The pad see ew and the satay chicken looked really nice.
A very nice addition to the neighbourhood. Compared to Thai Elephant down the street, it is different, not necessarily better food , but definitely better, more attentive service."}
{"text":"I guess it was just over hyped, but Nana really fell short for me. 

The service was great, servers attentive and it was fairly a slow night. The choice of music was a little weird, it was a compilation of covers of popular songs, and it seemed disjointed...like someone's mp3 was playing on shuffle. So yeah...idk lol was a bit confused about the ambience.

My boyfriend and I both ordered Khao Soi (which we've have before at Pai, with beef, not chicken) and it just fell really short. The chicken was a bit on the salty side, I was expecting a heavier broth and a richer taste. It was mediocre at best. If you have the time, visit Pai."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times since it opened. The food keeps getting better.  I hareve tried many dishes which were excellent, still can't decide on the favourite.  Tom Yum soup is a must !   Secret desert."}
{"text":"If you have already tried Sukho Thai's food, this review would be useful

We ordered Shrimp Pad thai, Khao Soi and Masaman Curry:

Pad Thai:
The Pad Thai was not bad, it had a good flavour but it could have easily done with more spices. I didn't like how they used thin noodles instead of the thick ones. In short, it was good, but nowhere near Sukho Thai's Pad thai (which imo is the best i have tried yet)

Khao Soi:
I would have to disagree with other yelpers here, Khao Soi was relatively pretty bland. I am usually a person who finishes all his meal, but at the end curry was left and because there wasn't much taste to it, I didn't drink it (yes, i usually drink leftover curries (._. ))
Sukho Thai takes the cake here as well.

Masaman Curry:
Pretty good, the curry was thick and very flavourful. We chose the Spice level as \"Spicy\", and it could have easily done with more spices, so I think you'd be fine with \"Thai Spicy\" level if you're used to spices.
This is a little different than Sukho Thai, and i think it's better.

The service was great; we were seated promptly, and looked after by our server, she came by a few times while we were eating to check on us. The seating is totally STREET STYLE, you'd be sitting on uncomfortable wooden seats. I don't mind the seat and I think the environment was cozy and great.

We wanted to go to Khao San road, somehow ended up here. I am still not sure if this is the new Khao San road or what..."}
{"text":"The restaurant was small- on a weeknight, I waited about 20 minutes for a table for two. Once we got our table, we were actually sharing it with another couple, eating elbow-to-elbow... and were practically a part of their conversation. Everyone had to talk over each other because it was so busy and loud.

The food was good- tasted fresh and pricing was as expected.

I would give this place another try- hopefully it's not as packed next time."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I was here with a group of people to try this place out.  I believe most of us had not been here before so a new experience for the group.  It's tiny and the tables are close together but that doesn't detract from the super yummy delicious food they have here!  We ended up ordering several dishes and sharing family style (the portions for each dish are a bit on the smaller side in comparison to what we normally thing of a portion size but for me it's just perfect).  We had chicken skewers with peanut sauce which was delicious, this wonderful fried chicken pieces that were my favourite dish of the night - oh my it was a burst of flavour profiles it my mouth!   Spicy and breaded and so moist...oh man I'd go back for a plateful of that dish!  There was a chicken noodle dish and a shrimp dish and a noodle beef dish where it looked like beef hot dogs cut up in it.  Everything was amazing.  They even put 4 different types of chili sauces for you to try - careful some are HOT!  

Service was attentive and luckily we made reservations - there was a line up out the door when we were leaving!  It's a really small space to make reservations and try to make it for an off time - we had dinner at 5:30pm and were ok but an hour later it was getting packed.  

Definitely coming back to try this place again!  Yum and Yum!"}
{"text":"Maybe 4 stars if your a local and do take out. Interior is cramped, music way too loud. Helps drone out the awful/boring hipster 'chatter'.  A dinner with tax (minus tip) almost 20 bucks.  Great tasting meal, something with chicken and curry sauce, names confusing."}
{"text":"Nana is another popular Thai restaurant in the Trinity Bellwoods. The comparison to Pai and Khao San Road are founded and they are a popular spot for Thai lovers as well. The place is really trendy inside with a long bar and more seating than the outside would make you believe. 

I came with a group of 8 so we ordered a wide variety of dishes to taste and to get an idea of how good the food can be. We had a variety of appetizers like their chicken satay, papaya salad, fresh rolls with pork, viet spring rolls, and their southern fried chicken laab. The papaya salad is spicy so be ready for that. The rolls were good as well as the satay, but the big winner was the fried chicken laab. Nice chunks of boneless chicken deep fried and tossed in some nice little spices.

For mains, we tried kua gling pork ribs which were quickly cooked pork ribs tossed in a curry sauce and served over rice. The pad grao prao fried rice was good, but I thought a bit too oily and sticky. The Pada Mama with Hot Dog was mediocre. It's just instant noodle with chunks of hot dog. The pad prik king with Chicken was excellent. The chicken had a nice kick and the beans were done well too with a good crunch. The shrimp pad thai was probably my favorite as the shrimp were juicy and plump while the noodles were so damn good that it was a shame to share.

The place itself is very nice and the servers are even nicer! The food was very good and prices are right along many of the other places. With so many food options in the area, Nana really carves out its own place and based on how popular and packed it gets on nights (as soon as 6pm hits, the masses arrive). Make sure you make reservations ahead or you won't get a chance."}
{"text":"Compared to Khao San Road, the portions are smaller. Decor at Nana much more celebratory and fun compared to the relaxed atmosphere it was at Khao San. Price is reasonable for the food. More reflective of what it's like to eat on the streets of Thailand in terms of decor, furniture, vibe. Friendly service. Table turnover rate is average coupled with limited seating which justifies the long wait line. 

The Mi Ga Ti Moo, curry soup was phenomenal and created the right balance of heavy curry but a lighter flare to it. Texture of noodles and fresh bean sprouts made a nice balance. Would have taken the soup to go if we could! Tom yum soup was not overly sour and again provided a nice balance between hot and sour, with tastes not over powering one another. Could have been a bit spicier for my taste. Pad Thai I loved at Khao San Road. At nana it was good but not as tasty as it was back at the original location. The basil flavors and egg weren't as evident at Nana, still good and fair for its price, but not memorable. Would consider this more of a Fusion Thai restaurant than an authentic location. 

Relaxed dinner and good food at an affordable price. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Had the southern fried chicken laab......the best! Explosion of flavor! I would defiantly suggest this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go here, having had a great experience at Khao San Road. 

Walking into Nana, you realize how tight a place it is. Space is an issue. The area to put your name on a waitlist is small and cramped with people. The servers were constantly yelling at people to keep the door closed so not to let the cold in. It was a poor first impression of the place. It would be better if the wait line and the hostess were outside.

After 50 minutes, we were sat at the table closest to the door. The tables are communal, adjacent to the wall, and ours had 5 plastic red stools with one of them being at the head of the table. As we sat down, the server asked us not to sit across from each other, but rather one person at the head and the other at the side because this would make it easier for the servers.

I find it bizarre that you would cramp tables into your restaurant so that there's not enough space to serve people. Then, ask people to sit unconventionally because its easier for you.

The plastic stools felt cheap and uncomfortable. The cutlery had sharp handles and felt like it was cutting my hands as I ate. The couple beside us said they were modeling the restaurant off of street food places in Bangkok. Ok, I get that, but you can't charge queen st west prices for a cheap bangkok street food experience.

The food was good, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 but didn't really have to wait on a week day night. We seemed out Nana because of our Khao San Road cravings. Overall I did not have a great experience and don't think I will go back. The restaurant is very small and the tables are cramped. The chairs are of cheap plastic and extremely uncomfortable. The cutlery also looked like cheap plastic but perhaps that was the theme they were going for. Overall the food was mediocre and even though they had some Khao San Road features m, it was no where close. I also found the price for an entree to be pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Nana does amazing Thai food in a fun (but slightly kitschy) atomosphere. We've been to Thailand and found the food bang on in terms of flavour. Nana does the sweet, sour, spicy, hot combination that is so addictive in Thai food so well.

We made a reservation for 9 on Saturday night and hit our own table for a while, although ended up sharing after a while. The music is loud, the space is cramped but cute and the stools are uncomfortable plastic. They definitely went all out on the Bangkok street food scene and its a cool vibe. 

We ordered cocktails and Chang beers (two drinks each) plus two apps and two entrees: the fresh rolls, fried chicken, pork ribs and khao soi. The bill came to just over $100 with tip - reasonable for a full dinner for two. Everything we ate was fantastic - particularly the khao soi and the fried chicken,which was salty, sour and spicy and so addictive. All the flavour combos seemed both authentic and well thought out. Portions were a good size and we took home a doggy bag of the pork ribs - the flavour of the curry was great but the texture of the meat wasn't as tender as I hoped. 

The service was attentive and they asked our opinions of the various dishes - a nice touch. We'll be back to sample more of the menu and eat more fried chicken for sure."}
{"text":"Tasty thai joint. Casual atmosphere, boxes of chang beer chilling in the hallways. Nice.

The fried chicken laab appetizer is a MUST TRY. It's a bit pricy for the portion, but the taste is AMAZING. My friend advertised it as good fried chicken, but I said whatever (how good can fried chicken be, afterall?) Oh man, when I put it in my mouth, I was knocked back in surprise at how amazing it tasted. It's got some sort of a lemony pepper seasoning, with mint and shallots. Plate-licking good, even to just eat the seasonings. The chicken chunks themselves were juicy and tender. I couldn't get over how good it was and couldn't think about anything else until I finished it.

Pad gra prao was kinda unremarkable. The khao soi was one of the better ones in the city, but also just okay. (You can tell it's hard for me to judge these dishes after having that chicken laab...even if you're just passing by, you have to get it!)

Also, ran into Kiezsa in the restaurant, but decided not to bother her (whaaaat)."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait time, the food didn't come until 45 minutes later after we ordered - at different times! Food is way below average, barely warm. One of the dishes had cold meat in it."}
{"text":"First time here, big fan of Khao San road. A bit disappointed with the portions of food and drink for the price they were charging. Food wasn't as flavourful. Seating a bit off with plastic chairs. Servers didn't even ask is how the food was. Probably won't come back and go to Pai. Their portions are larger for the same price."}
{"text":"Fresh flavours with a slow burn! We enjoyed the papaya salad, Tom yum soup and the Khao soi.  Yum!  

Papaya salad:  crunchy, fresh, piquant, nice heat 

Tom yum:  perfect for a winters day.  Nice flavours but not too salty. Lemongrass flavours shine!

Khao soi: noodles bathed in creamy curry broth topped w succulent chicken.  Nice contrast of smooth vs crunchy!

Wish I had room for:  Thai iced tea and fried chicken...next time!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Nana for the longest time and only went in 'cause I stumbled upon it without meaning to one day.  The space is tiny, and the decor wanted you to think that you were on a street somewhere in Thailand.  It worked!  The food was a tad bit pricier than similar restaurants for smaller portions, but they were fantastic!  The best part of Nana was the Chang beers!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service, bad food. 

Atmosphere:
The atmosphere was great, local Thai vibe with nice wood decor. Makes it feel authentic and lively.

Service:
The service was great, knowledgeable servers can help provide clarity to the menu. They come occasionally to check up and fill water which was nice. Service was also prompt.

Food:
We tried hard to enjoy the food however the food wasn't good. It's disappointing because we had high expectations of the place since it's related to Khao San road. The spring rolls were crispy however we found them too savory. For mains we had the massaman curry and the boat noodles. The curry was sweet and sour, unlike any other massaman curry we've had before. It was way too sweet. The boat noodles we found to be overspiced which made the dish undesirable. The beef was extremely tough and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Acceptable, but definitely not the best. Colourful, community-life atmosphere. But, it's definitely a squeeze. Tables are very close together - if you come here in the winter, you may actually struggle trying to hang your jacket up on the hooks behind you (for fear of hitting the head of the person beside you with your heavy winter coat!). We also thought cleanliness was an issue here - cutlery needed to be wiped down a few times, as did the table. The atmosphere tries to be cute and chic, but there's still a hint of street and industrial (don't know if that was intentional or not).

My other half and I are big fans of Khao San Road, so we were hopeful that this place would meet its standards, but it doesn't (far from, in fact). Portions are a tad smaller, and the food just isn't as special or tasty. We ordered the fried chicken and chicken pad thai - it was alright. The fried chicken had good hints of earthiness that was nice and unique, but it was a little too chewy for my liking (more dark meat than white meat). The pad thai was okay - but it didn't taste authentic or as flavourful as I'd like. 

I'm sure you can find better Thai restaurants in the city with tastier dishes than the ones you can find here. Overall, acceptable, but nothing more than that."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but poor atmosphere/service. Good if you want a quick bite, but not the place if you want to have a relaxed dinner and not feel pressured to leave."}
{"text":"Yaaaassssss. Sister of khan san road and equally amazeballs.
I had the red curry at spice level 3. Once I bit down on the chills in the dish it was the spice level I desired. Delicious and full of flavour. Love it. Eat here already. 
Cute atmosphere, but stupid low stool chairs are the only option for sitting. Worth it t"}
{"text":"Was out strolling on Queen ST West last night looking for a bite to eat and we came across Nana. From the street it just looked so appealing , great fun decor  and very nice staff. The food was delicious, I had the green curry and my husband the Pad Thai  and we finished this off with coconut  gelato. A fun friendly place with great home cooked food. We sat at the bar  which was fun.
Great evening and we plan to go back with friends."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Thai street food experience, this is the place... Just stay near a bathroom afterwards to complete the evening. The food itself is tasty and spicy, but the meal left everyone in my group feeling upset later.

Even still, I wouldn't call it as well crafted and memorable as its sister Khao San Road. 

If you want an authentic Thai experience, without the upset stomach, stick to Khao San Road or Pi."}
{"text":"Very solid Thai food, not too pricy (but maybe a bit for Canadian standards). Nice selection of drinks."}
{"text":"I think it is safe to say that this is the best Thai food in the city.  While I have always enjoyed Khao San Road, Nana's food is even better.  Each dish feels like the perfect embodiment of what traditional Thai food is supposed to taste like (while dining in a fun atmosphere).  Everything here is perfectly spiced.  I would strongly recommend the Mushroom Laab (I'm not a meat-eater, but have been told the Chicken Laab is even better, if that is even possible) and their Red Curry.  The Papaya Salad is also a great starter and the \"Special\" Roti is a perfect end to the meal.  I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family on a busy Friday night . Of course we had reservations and were given a super tiny table. It wasn't very comfortable at all. The food made up for it big time. Chicken pad Thai and Khao soi was delicious. The green curry was spot on. The ambience was fun and lively and service was attentive. Sure I'll visit again, probably not with family"}
{"text":"We've tried the pad thai and green curry chicken here. Both are tasty enough but my husband and I both agreed that something was a bit off about the flavours. I think that I personally prefer Pai or Khao San Road's versions of these dishes and that might be why this place gets only 3 stars in my opinion...

Service was good - not amazing but also nothing to complain about. Prices were comparable to other Thai places downtown - it seems they all have the same pricing of about $15-$18 or so per dish. The portions seem a bit smaller here though.

Casual street food gathering place type of vibe to it and loud but serves its purpose if you're looking for somewhere low key and want Thai food. Might come back here but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Food and price is great! We had a wide variety of items. The papaya salad was great and I had the khao soi with chicken. The service was good, only complaint is the seats are too uncomfortable!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Thai restaurant by far in Toronto! The decor of it reminds me of street eats in Asia. The colourful plastic chairs is particularly nostalgic for me:)

It was pretty busy when we got there around 8:30pm, but we managed to get a shared table with two other people- which was fine, there was still plenty of room:)

I love that there were four different chilli spice on each table, some were pickled, dried or puréed ! I like how you can modify your dish according to your own taste!

The grilled oyster mushroom was very intriguing for my tastebuds! It's got sour, sweet, salty and spiciness all in one bite:), it also has a hint of fermented taste to it ( those of you that likes the stinky tofu smell in Taiwan will for sure enjoy this dish)

Ordered pad Thai for the main dish, I had it with veggie and tofu. I particularly enjoy the slightly more sweet taste to the sauce, and this was spot on!! Will definitely return for more!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Nana. This place is a great alternative to your standard Thai options in the city(not that I don't love those too). They offer deliciously unique dishes you can't really find anywhere else while keeping a few of the classics. Love the street vibe and good tunes. Would definitely recommend Nana as the number one Thai option west of Spadina. 5 STARS"}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to Khao San Road, but I don't think it is nearly as good.  The food is decent, and better then average thai in the city, but I have had a few misses too.  The seating is very casual, with plastic stools at the tables.  
I really like the fried rice with an egg on top.  However, I ordered it as take out once and it was not good at all.  The portion was really small and it was super oily.
That being said, we went for Song Kran, which is thai new years and it was suuuuuper fun!  They give you water guns to shoot each other and bring out the food in small courses that you eat as you run around.  If you get the opportunity I was recommend going for this.  You have to buy tickets in advance and they sell out fast."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming to this restaurant. Have been there before once but when I got there today, they were closed at 6pm even though they had advertised their Sunday hours to be opened 5pm to 10pm. Not only were they closed but there was no sign whatsoever to indicate why they were closed. Very inconvenient for their patrons!"}
{"text":"Nana was supposed to be a temporary business while Khao San Road near downtown moves a block east, but is now a permanent restaurant. When Khao San Road reopens in its new location there will be two of them for this owner.
Nana's food looks and feels home-made. It is delicious. I had the Kua Gling Pork Ribs and they were a good delicious choice. The food lacks spice here, but chili peppers are readily available on the tables. I tasted my friend's rice dish and while hers was another choice the feeling was similar. The prices are a little high for the portion and location, but we definitely forgive them for the taste and authenticity. This is not your fake Chinese food court pad thai!
The atmosphere and décor looks Thai and the colourful walls are a nice touch.

This is not Blogto so we will also be honest and discuss the negatives. What I did not like were the stools (an overdone long-in-the-tooth trend), the fact that the waiter bumped into me whenever he was serving or talking to the next table (comes out of his tip) and the other lame Toronto fad of sharing tables with others. Sorry, I am here to eat with my friend not with strangers who are talking about nonsense."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something new, and Nana provided. The food was delicious and both of our plates arrived at the same time. If you're in a group of two you'll have to share a table with another group of two (the place is small, if I had known that before hand I would not have gone). If/when I'm ever in Toronto again I will go back."}
{"text":"We were excited to find out that KSR had a sister restaurant that was its bolder version. We went right around 6 pm when it opens and the restaurant was beginning to fill up quickly on a saturday night. The tables are family style, if you come as a couple you will invariably end up sharing the table with another couple. The place gets loud as well. The plastic stools were uncomfortable but if you don't plan to spend a lot of time there, it works out reasonably fine. 

I had the Silom sour cocktail. Contrary to public opinion on yelp, I actually liked my cocktail. It had a hint of tamarind and chilli which gave it a nice kick. 

We shared the southern fried chicken laab. This was finger-licking delicious, tender nuggets of chicken with a tangy kick. The herbs and onions were a good accompaniment. I would order this dish any day. 

Next up we had the pad see ew with chicken (aka drunken noodles). This dish reminded us of the street food in bangkok. It didn't have a lot of spiciness to it but that worked out well since the red curry we ordered had a good deal of spice in it. 

Overall, the food quality was great. The couple next to us tried an entirely different set of dishes and they were gushing praises as well. 

Service was a bit off, our server kept passing our table only to be turned back. It needs a bit more work. 

Apparently they don't adjust the spice level in the dishes here, so be warned if you cannot handle spicy. 

The other oddity is that the table surface and the plates don't have any friction, so the plates keep slipping with slight movement. Watch out before your food flies to the table next to you :)

The coat stand was a bit weird since there was no lighting there and I had great difficulty in finding my coat. Apparently despite telling them, they did not bother to bring back my coat so I had to fetch it myself. Had to switch on the lights in the adjacent restrooms to get some light there. 

Next time, I would do a take out option instead. KSR has much more comfort in dining in compared to this place."}
{"text":"I asked for spicy panang curry but received a sweet curry. Complained about the sweetness of the curry and was given chilli flakes! Ordered the nasty and bland spring roll with pork and crab. Waste of your hard-earned dollars!"}
{"text":"Nana was a pleasant surprise. It was quite different than the run of the mill thai restaurants in town. The dishes were presented well and we're different in flavor. The fried chicken starter was lovely. Very tangy and spicy. The yellow curry fried rice was nice and so was the red curry. The satay was also good. The place is a bit of a tight fit. I guess space is a premium on Queen west...it's a solid choice. Go for it. ..."}
{"text":"It's the same old story with these guys, terrible service, poor staffing, incredibly frustrating seating. I like the fact that they moved to a more accessible neighborhood, but the same problems are still glaring directly at managements incompetence. Honestly, they just started using a reservation system after years of complaints and Khao San Road. At least now they'll would be able to turn a lot more covers given their lack of seating.

The only saving grace here is the food, forget the lousy atmosphere, useless wait staff and hipster scumbags and get your order to go."}
{"text":"Nana is doing a pop up of Khao San Road and we made a trek there to celebrate my birthday as I've enjoy all previous experiences. Super rubbish arrogant attitude this time. We had to share a table which is fine. We asked for the table by the window and the hostess refused saying its for four. Then we said the other table is also for four. So then she said it's hard for them to get to serve. So we said we'd still like to and its my birthday so could she accommodate. She says ' many birthday girls come here' so no we don't  have that table'. 
Sorry man. You've totally a lost  customer of three years. And ruined a few minutes if my birthday. No matter how big you get a rude attitude is unacceptable."}
{"text":"ok food. terrible service. menu is small, 1 vegetarian option, no flexibility. i was with a date, we walked in around 6pm (early for downtown Toronto), the place is about 1/3 full. he seats us at a 4-seater with another couple. i ask for our own table, and he says that they want to make room for others. there are no others!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 The taste of the food is authentic and on par with khao san road. Definitely a good place to go to learn about great thai food.

Service 4/5 Service was friendly, however the space is tight and dense, so I feel there's not enough staff or room to give adequate service to customers who are not low maintenance.

Atmosphere 3.5/5 Place is noisy and raucous, which is good if you're into party type atmospheres. If you like quiet places for conversations this is not the place for you. Unfortunately, I prefer quieter restaurant atmospheres.

Value 3/5 Food is quite expensive for what you get. If you want to stuff your face be prepared to pay around $35-$50 bucks easy. 

Drinks 4.5/5 Had a thai coconut mango rum cocktail. it was mind blowing."}
{"text":"If I were to judge this place on food alone, it would be a 4. The problem with Nana is the establishment's need to ensure every single seat is filled.  I get it...you have a business to run and you want to make money.  However, when it negatively impacts the overall experience of the diner to the point where they no longer come to your establishment, it's time to rethink your policies. The way they try to organize seating arrangements is like playing Tetris trying to fill in every hole.

Here's the scenario. I came here with a friend and we were waiting for another friend for a table of 3. Now, if you are a table of 3, your choices are either:
-Half of a small table of 4 with an extra stool stuck on the side
-Small table of 2 with an extra stool stuck on the side
All of these arrangements are incredibly uncomfortable. You don't have the option to wait for a table of 4...in their eyes, 3 people in a table of 4 equals an empty seat.

The restaurant wasn't even packed at the time when we came in...they just wanted to ensure that they optimized every single seating arrangement. So the waiter seats me and my friend down at a table for 2 and keeps asking when our friend would be arriving, constantly telling us that their policy is that they don't seat parties until they all arrive. I'm like I get it, if we were taking up a bigger table or if the restaurant was packed, I totally understand. But come on, even if my friend didn't show up, where would we be seated? At the exact same table for 2! So what difference does it make?

Like I said before, the food is great here. I would come back here over and over again if we had a comfortable dining experience.  I'm sure there are a ton of others that feel the same.  Rather than focussing on capitalizing on every seat in house, focus on the customers there and it will pay off in loyalty."}
{"text":"Came here to grab take out for dinner on a Saturday night. Called in advanced to order and within 1ins of pick up, the food was ready. Ordered the red curry, and grounded pork in rice noodles with curry. Can't remember the exact dish name. The food was flavourful and spiced to perfect. The spring rolls had a unique filling wit crab meat and pork. Definitely will go in for a sit down eat as the atmosphere looks cozy and invited. Overall, good Thai food resto worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Lunch portions of curry are very small though.  It's like a child's portion. I guess they expect you to round it out with soup or appetizers, but then things start to get too expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Went here again.. Had the green curry with shrimp and pad prik king. Awesome street-like atmosphere with red plastic stools, cheap Chang beers and 90s music. For the atmosphere and flavors of the food, it's worth visiting and waiting in line for!"}
{"text":"I had Pad See Ew and it was amazing. Big flat noodles in a somewhat sweet but very savoury brown sauce. Maybe like a teriyaki but much better. I also tried Khao Soi. It was in a big bowl in a curry-like broth with noodles. Amazing! 

They're doing Khao San Road lunch. I'm not sure how that differs from their regular lunch (if they even have lunch) but it was delicious and I'm in love with a new lunch spot even though this place has been here for a while. 

Best Thai I tried in the neighbourhood; it blows Thai Elephant out of the park. 

Highly recommended for Khao San Road lunch. Hopefully when that stops they're still open and equally delicious."}
{"text":"My partner brought me to have a second dinner at Nana after a first dinner elsewhere. I swear I was so bloated and would not have been able to pick up a fork, had the food not blow my damn mind.

Yes, I have frequented Khao San Road plenty of times.

We ordered the laab kai tod (southern fried chicken salad), chicken pad thai lo ban, and a thai iced tea. The pad thai was so homely and sweet and seriously made me want to hug the home-maker Thai mother that I didn't have. I didn't want to add lime to taste, as I thought no, no. This pad thai could not be made better. But then I did add lime and it was even better.

The fried chicken salad really won me over. Swoon, just thinking about it. It is cooked to perfection, balanced, and complex in flavour. You will try to guess each ingredient in hopes of recreating this masterpiece at home.

Lastly, I will never revisit a thai restaurant if their thai iced tea did not bode well with me. The thai iced tea here was so thick and unapologetically authentic that you will form an emotional connection with your drink. It was so hard to not order a second glass.

As much as I would love to explore the rest of the menu, I would absolutely return to reorder these menu items.

As for the service, the servers were always present, happy, informative, and attentive to the guests. My table had a seafood allergy - even after giving the thumbs up to the server to go ahead with a dish with oyster sauce, the chef sent her right back out for double assurance. I felt like my business was genuinely appreciated.

It is a lively, fast-paced restaurant with small tables and the right ambiance for a Queen St. West joint. I would recommend here to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff.
Their Pad-se-ew is definitely the best."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars. 

Good: the food was quite delicious. It was a little more saltier than I would like it, but the flavours were great! The atmosphere was fun, hipster and trying to replicate a Thailand scene. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and satay skewers. The service was okay and was able to get a seat after we put our name down on the waitlist (15mins wait)

Bad: i thought it was definitely pricey for what they were serving. A little cramped. I just couldn't justify paying that much for a thai meal when the food was good, and not amazing."}
{"text":"Nana Hack: How to Eat Bangkok-style Street Food on Queen West

1) Don't come famished: Like Sukho Thai (4*s) and Khao San Road (4*s), this hip, colourful Thai restaurant is busy at all hours of the day. Depending on your luck, you could wait up to an hour. But Sunday evening around 6-7 pm, there was no wait but the place was at capacity.

2) Thin is in: Squeeze in your tummy! If not you, you will see your servers doing vertical ab-crunches while they bring out your meals. Tables and chairs are so tightly juxtaposed that you'll wish you didn't have that extra scoop from Bang Bang.

3) A gentle hand to rule the land: Utensils are cheap = they have sharp edges. For an extra comfort, bring your own gloves to dine with. Pro tip: use both hands to eat your meal, hold your bowl with one hand and your utensil with the other or else the lightweight bowl will slip.

4) Pay it cool: They take cash, credit, and debit. Plastic card holders, pay at the ledge near the entrance where the two machines are located.

5) No patio, but the decor is a burst of fun. Bonus points for the hidden projector and movie screen. If you're a party of 2, ask to sit at the bar. If you're 4, you'll be seated at the lower tables, which will require you to dine street food style (plastic chairs and tiny tables). 

6) Skim their menus: Food suggestions include the fried chicken appetizer (perfect to share for two) and the Khao Soy (almost identical to Sukho Thai's, except the chicken is fried, plus the bean sprouts were a refreshing addition). Their drinks list is like a phone book.

An aromatic and spicy edge to Queen West, Nana is a solid 4/5 stars for food and atmosphere. A tad expensive for 2 meals, 1 starter, 1 drink + tax and tip, at around $62. Nana is your culinary passport to the streets of Bangkok. Go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been here three times. Every time has been super attentive service and the food is all delicious. I also enjoy their cocktails and their beer list! My favourite menu item has to be the chef's special fried rice, you don't want to miss out on that or the chicken wings. It's a casual place but a little cramped on stools, so only go if you're in the mood for that. If there are just two of you it's comfortable to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Khao soi, khao soi, khao soi. Filling, flavourful, warm, sensual, I could go on. As part of the Khao San Road chain of restaurants offering amazing Thai street food, Nana is my new local place when I get a khao soi craving and it never disappoints. Unlike KSR, you only have option of chicken here (no braised beef), but it's too delicious to care.

Recently I also decided to be adventurous and eat a non-khao-soi menu option. I went with the \"boat noodle soup with beef\". And my goodness, was I glad I did. Super flavourful broth and lots of beef (three types - braised, beef balls, strips). Add some chilli flakes for some extra punch and you've got yourself a perfect meal.

The decor is great. The window shutters almost make you feel like you're in a small alley somewhere. The plastic red stools are authentic, but not the most comfortable. Don't worry, you'll live. This place is worth the bum-discomfort. 

Oh and lastly, service is always on point in my experience. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food wise, my pad see ew, was ok.  Its essentially tastes like a Thai version of the Chinese fried rice noodle with beef dish.  The noodle itself is slightly different.  Looks like a pappardelle, but tastes like a chewier rice noodle (hor fun).  The sauce, is soy sauce and oyster sauce based and cooked with chicken, egg and gai lan.  I have to admit there was some good 'wok hay'.  Hubby's mi ga ti with pork started off with a good tasting red curry base with the addition of ground pork and tofu.  Reminded me of ma po tofu, but in a soupy curry sauce.  The noodles were the thin rice noodles, and super overcooked.  Overcooked to the point where if you tried to pick up the noodles with your fork the noodles would break.  You essentially needed to eat this dish with a spoon.  The dish also came out at borderline room temperature, too cold for my liking.  My dish came out piping hot, so not sure if my hubby's dish was cooked first and left sitting until my dish was done to bring both out at the same time."}
{"text":"I came with high expectations since it was the sister of Khao San Road, and it was hyped up to be one of Toronto Life's top best new restaurants of 2015. 

My initial impressions of the street-food-style set-up was that it was kind of cool, even if we were shoved into a tiny table with 2 strangers. But the novelty wore off an hour after we placed our orders and our food still had not arrived. The strangers whom we were sharing our personal bubbles with at the table ordered literally 5 minutes before us and finished their entire meal before we even received our drink orders. When we reminded our waitress that our food had not come yet, she was kind of like 'oh yeah....' (I seriously think she forgot about us, no joke). She was not apologetic, and our food pretty much came 5 minutes after asking. These are not complex dishes that take an hour to make, especially the Thai iced tea, there's absolutely no excuse for that.

In terms of the food, it's nothing spectacular that makes up for the poor service. I'd rather go to Pai or Sukothai (different owners now) that offer the same, if not better, tasting food, more comfortable seating, and quicker & more pleasant service. 

The best of it all, just when you think you can leave this place and stretch out your cramped up legs from hovering on cheap plastic stools, you have to fight a crowd to pay your bill with credit card at the front of the restaurant. I could have honestly walked out without paying and they probably wouldn't have noticed. There must be a better solution to this madness. When you have a fairly successful restaurant, how do you mess up your second one so badly? 

Here's a good tip: Ask twice for everything, you won't get it the first time (drinks, food, bill, takeout containers, your sanity)........"}
{"text":"After some incredible rumor milling to stir up the crowd and a killer popup that brought together nearly a dozen favorite restaurants and food initiatives from across Toronto, Monte Wan has finally delivered his new masterpiece - an ambitious restaurant aiming to shake up the Thai scene in Toronto.  Wan's the owner and face of the much-lauded Khao San Road, and while he's no stranger to success, he's well aware of the stagnation plaguing high-end Thai in this city.  Satanee Nana is Wan's ambitious attempt to inject innovation into the Toronto Thai scene.

And boy does it work!  Just four days after opening the cocktail program is waiting in the wings alongside an ice cream partnership with a Kensington standout.  But the food is here, and the menu's absolutely killer.  If you're a fan of any of the big Thai places in Toronto you simply NEED to eat here. 

Southern Fried Chicken Laab - $12 - Wan introduced this starter as likely becoming a signature dish for Nana, and my dining companion and I couldn't agree more.  Tender nuggets of chicken are fried to snacky perfection, then tossed in a dressing of roasted rice flour, green onion, chili, cilantro, red onion, and lime juice (amongst others).  The result is the biggest standout of the evening: every bite delivers the incredible tang, heat, salt, sweetness, and savory flavors that give Thai cuisine its appeal.  The dish unfolds in your mouth like a storybook: sweet and tart lime hits the tip of your tongue first, as the flavor of the chicken sets up shop on the center of your tongue.  Heat and saltiness build, and then the entire mouth is overwhelmed with tangy lime and chili, tempered by hints of cilantro and red onion.  It's insane; one of the best things I've eaten this year.

Vietnamese Style Spring Rolls - $9 - Crystalline fried rice wrappers are filled with flavorful pork, bolstered by the richness of crab.  While the Fried Chicken Laab was a bombastic dish exploding with flavors, the Spring Rolls are bold, but more subtle; the flavor of the crab enriches the pork, but then comes into its own on the back end of the tasting with a pleasant oceanic aroma that fills the nose and back of the throat.

Fresh Rolls With Pork - $8 - Perfectly tender rice rolls filled with what appears to be minced pork, mushroom, glass noodles, and leafy greens outshine their chicken sausage equivalent at KSR (a dish that's no slouch on its own; in fact, one of my favorites).  This was the least impressive of the three starters we had, but still excellent.  Be careful - they're open-ended, so dip them sideways and try to tackle each piece as a single bite.

Mi Ga Ti With Pork - $15 - We were split on which entree we felt to be the strongest, but this one was my favorite: a rich, peanut-buttery curry broth filled with minced pork, silken cubed tofu, and noodles for softness, matched with leek and bean sprouts for crunch.  The flavors of the pork and the curry are brilliantly mixed; the textures and contrast are outstanding; and the entire dish is a smooth amalgamation studded with variety between bites.  I loved this just as much as I love the Khao Soi at KSR.

Pad Mama With Hotdogs - $15 - Soft wispy noodles concealed florets of grilled hotdog in one of Toronto's few dishes that plays for whimsy and actually achieves deliciousness in the process.  Chinese broccoli and napa cabbage add contrast and crunch to the mix of textures, and their mild flavors play well in what's a surprisingly subtle dish.  As tasty as it is alarming, this was my dining companion's favored entree.

Milk Roti - $6 - An exceptional dessert, we remarked that we could eat another order immediately.  How little did we know...  Fried and lightly browned roti arrives steaming hot, covered in a drippy glaze of sweetened condensed milk.  It's sticky-sweet without being cloying or overpowering, the roti chewy, and crisp, and seductively buttery all at the same time.  This was delicious.  I won't eat here without ordering at least one of the rotis.

Ovaltine Roti - Off Menu - Described by Wan as part of an effort to create unique dishes for the Toronto Mealshare charity, we had no idea this existed until Wan came and asked us what we had for dessert.  When he mentioned there was an off-menu roti we unbuckled our belts one more notch and braced for impact.  The Ovaltine Roti is fried crispy and buttery like the Milk Roti, but melts with flavors of caramel and browned butter.  It's awesome!  Ask your server for availability. 

Satanee Nana's clearly playing to a more narrow and experienced demographic than the other big Thai places.  This is meant for people who've loved Khao San Road, along with its predecessors and spinoffs, but now crave something new.  It's either going to be a hit with diners or a complete and total implosion.  Is Toronto ready for this?  I certainly hope so, but in the meantime I'll be eating here every chance I can get just in case the ambitious effort is short-lived.

Go there.  So good."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out Nana for the longest time. And when my Yelp friend suggest that to be the \"N\" for my JEN 5K food crawl, I am IN!

Making a reservation via email was A-OK. At least they takes reservation, not like Khao San Road. Our party of 10 were given only 90 minute time frame for our dining experience, which I was ok with that. But then they called me 30 minute before my reservation and left me a message telling me we only have 60 minute for our reservation?!!! because they overbooked?! 
-5 star

Luckily we have our \"family style\" menu planned ahead and known exactly what to order. (Sorry to my friends as they have to eat whatever I ordered) and with $20 pp budget tax and tips incl as a pre dinner snack. For groups 18% gratuity mandatory.

We shared:

Satay Grilled Chicken with Peanut Sauce ($11)
Fresh Roll with Pork ($8)
Vietnamese Style Spring Rolls with Pork & Crab ($9)
Southern Fried Chicken Laab ($12)
Chef Top's Pad Gra Prao Fried Rice ($16)
Pad Prik King Chicken ($15)
Pad Mama with Hot Dog ($15)
Pad Thai Bolan with Shrimps ($15+$2)
Kua Gling Pork Ribs ($16)

I like the interesting flavours and the herbs/spices they used. Love all those chili options on the table! Price wise they are definitely on the pricey side with a small portion. 

Great fun as a night out with a group of friends. Service was fast and efficient. We were able to finish our meals in a hour or so. 

Will I be back? I doubt it but at least this is a good Thai food option if ever I have craving!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and got lucky to be seated right away since a table just finished up. Service was quick. Ordered the pad thai, masaman curry, and a thai iced tea. The good? The thai ice tea was thick, super sweet and flavourful. The pad thai tasted like Khao San Road so it was pretty good as well. Lots of chicken in the dish which was great. The bad? The masaman curry was pretty bad. It had an interesting flavour and was really sweet. I felt bad for my friend though, he had the beef noodle soup and said it was disgustingly sweet. For the price point, I'd suggest to go to other popular Thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I went to Nana during peak dinner time on a weekday and was so glad to get a table as Khao San Road almost always has a wait. 

The food was as expected, very delicious! We started with the fried chicken which was so good I was tempted to get a second order. I then got the pad thai which was perfect. The staff were wonderful, very kind, and attentive. 

The only reason this is a 4 star instead of 5 was the quality of a few thing. The cutlery might as well have been plastic, I'm not sure what it was made out of. The plates were all plastic, along with the chairs. I'm, by no means, heavier than the average person, but I felt that a leg could have easily broken off. I understand the whole \"street\" style but I do expect something a bit better when dining out. I also feel as though the hot sauces could have been presented in something other than large water glasses, it just felt cheap that they couldn't find something appropriate to use."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night and ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Laab with a Pad Thai bo lan. This place is okay, I can understand it's hard to compare to Pai or Khao San Road. 

Pros: We didn't have to wait in a line and the pad Thai tasted good! 

Cons: Service was slow (I noticed behind the counter that they were frantically packing UberEats orders). Is it just me or are the prices the same for pad thai but portions are smaller here compared to Khao San or Pai? The fried chicken didn't live up to the hype for me, it just tasted okay and was too salty for my liking. They were also out of chicken fresh rolls, which I wanted to try. Bathrooms weren't really clean."}
{"text":"The decoration ,table and chairs have a Thailand street vendor kind of feeling, which js pretty cool 
Servers are awesome, appetizer delicious . Maindish not bad but not particularly outstanding(curry fried rice and pad Thai is awesome!)  overall a nice place to have dinner with friends, will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The food was just ok but the service was bad: waited for 40 minutes after ordering and the food didn't come at the same time. The food was not hot. Overpriced. The only reason there's lineup is perhaps ppl are impressed by its hipster outlook."}
{"text":"i've tried pai, sabai sabai, and quite a few other thai places in the city and khao san road was always my favourite so i was looking forward to nana but unfortunately, i was extremely disappointed. i keep reading these fantastic reviews on yelp so my heart sank.

ordered three...wait, wait....two things - third dish was \"sold out\".

for a friday night before the long weekend, it was steady but we still had to wait 20 minutes and then another 10 minutes because of their \"mix-up\"

1. khao soi with chicken was DELICIOUS.
2. king oyster mushroom laab, wouldn't know. it was served to the couple sitting next to us. hell, i don't even think they knew what it was because it was just unceremoniously plopped down in front of them.

which leads me to the service...more or less non-existent. they seemed more interested in hanging out around the bar. i get it, i've been there as both a bartender/server; it's 9:30ish, the restaurant closes at 11. you have already mentally checked out and kind of just want to fuck off/start thinking about what to do after you get off work. but c'mon, NOT when you still have customers to serve. shit, even salad king has better service than the collective present tonight at nana.

2 stars from me for the khao soi, 0 from the girlfriend who was hangrier when we left than we walked in since she never got the food she ordered. aside from the khao soi, they played some good hip-hop."}
