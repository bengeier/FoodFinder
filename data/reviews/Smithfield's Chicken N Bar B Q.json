{"text":"Good \"Down East\" NC style BBQ. We've had better chicken but the pulled pork sandwich with slaw is hard to beat. The Brunswick Stew special, buy one and get another for $1, is a deal!"}
{"text":"Quick family friendly spot for BBQ or chicken and Brunswick Stew.  BBQ sandwich is full of juicy pulled pork, with sauce to add on that is either vinegar based or a red sauce.  Crispy thin fries, big serving. Interestingly they have popcorn shrimp too.  The shrimp was good with a light batter.  Only side challenge was a runny mustard potato salad, but in fairness mayo based is my fav.   The service is top knotch, once new factor wears off, hopefully attentive service remains."}
{"text":"Got the white chicken plate.  Chicken was ok but nothing amazing.  Baked beans were syrupy and overly sweet, like they popped a can of bush's and microwaved them.  I might come back to check the pulled pork but something tells me that if you can't impress me with your baked beans, your barbecue is going to just be blah.  Also, no smoke in sight so maybe they cook the que in a crockpot, who knows?"}
{"text":"The big box is perfect for a group of friends. Just enough to share with about 4. The chicken is good and always fresh. The lemonade is soooo good! The wait time for inside or drive thru isn't horrible but make sure you're clear on your needs for condiments or anything else because they will not ask you in the drivethru."}
{"text":"I will definitely try this place again when I visit Charlotte. The location is great, near the Premium Outlets. The visiting manager Bryan provided us with the best southern hospitality. The servers through management visited our table and asked if we needed refills etc. For $10 you definitely get a meal for two people. The chicken was fresh and the hush puppies were delicious. A place like this does not exist in S Florida."}
{"text":"Uh....don't get it. Barbeque was weak, where the heck is the sauce? Chicken tenders average, where are the dipping sauces? Wife's shrimp was pathetically small. Napkin container empty at table. Refills? Guess you have to go to counter, but plenty of time for staff to goof around. One time stop only, will stick to proven winners. Showmars at Rivergate pounds this place into the ground."}
{"text":"This place serves really good Eastern NC Barbecue. It is done in a fast food set up. I think the Barbecue is delivered from where it is cooked to the stores. It does not seem to suffer much. Not the best I have ever had but still very good."}
{"text":"My husband always complained about not having a Smithfield's in Charlotte so now that we have one we went to check it out.
The servers are ones of the bests that I've ever seen, so friendly and courteous!
The place is big, clean and nice. The food gets done fast and the price is great.
The food it is great and I love their options.
I had a hotdog and hush puppies and my husband had barbecue with slaw. He loved his food, I-really enjoyed mine, the only thing was that my hotdog had no cheese because they do have cheese there!? The hush puppies were amazing!
I can't forget the banana pudding that was really good too.
We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Well this place just opened, I say they get an A+ for service. Stopped by the first day they were opened, the drive through line moved smoothly, no long waits. Shoestring fries good. Hush puppies good. Fried chicken was a bit mushy, almost reminded me of KFCs original recipe. I'm more if an extra crispy kind of girl. Seems like just salt and pepper seasoning on the chicken. I may stop by again, but I'll have to see what else they offer besides fried chicken or pulled pork."}
{"text":"The Customer service was superb. The Manager greeted us and showed us out. We were also greeted by other employees with a smile on their face. This is one place that other restaurants need to take after when it comes to customer service. They are Awesome!"}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was okay at best the fries looks as if they where soaked in oil. Like the oil was cold when they where placed in the oil. My better have got the four piece chicken box, the hushpuppies where not that great and the chicken kinda tasted sour. The skin was good though. This is an okay place but we won't be back. The service is the only reason why they got two stars. Everyone was nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I no longer have to drive to Mebane or Fayetteville to get Smithfields! I'm so excited! Located right before you get to the Charlotte Premium Outlets in an area that is really growing and Im sure will be a good fit for the area. 
I rarely go to the Charlotte Premium Outlets but I was running an errand and quickly went through the drive through on a Saturday afternoon. There was no one in line so I did not have to wait. I always seem to order the same thing when I go to Smithfields even though I have heard there chicken and shrimp plates are really good.
The employee taking my order was prompt and extremely friendly. I ordered my usual, the bbq sandwich plate with fries and a sweet tea. I did not add a side of hushpuppies this time but definitely try them! The hushpuppies are great. I received my order quickly, everything was correct, the guy at the window was really nice and made sure I had all the condiments I wanted before I left. 
Smithfields bbq is my favorite, it is definitely the Eastern Carolina style bbq that is more vinegar based and a little spicy. The sandwich comes with slaw on it but you can get it on the side. Make sure to order their bbq sauce. Sauce does not come on the sandwich or given with the plate. The fries are always hot but ask for salt. Smithfields does not salt their fries which is probably appreciated to some but I need a little salt on mine. 
If you go in to eat, the staff is always super friendly and helpful. Even though its a \"fast food\" restaurant they definitely give great service to everyone dining in. Such as refilling drinks and disposing trash for you."}
{"text":"Ummm so I wasn't aware that they just throw your food on the table lol.. that I don't like but the service was good . The food was ok could use a little more seasoning..."}
{"text":"So if your in the mood for good fried chicken and don't feel like going to your mamas house or making it yourself this is defiantly a place for you! 
I love this place for several reason not only is that always pleasant and gracious the food is also really good.
I was really excited when Smithfield's opened up a Charlotte location.
I normally go here when I'm ready to pig out and that's what I do. I get the Combo White which include chicken breast a wing and chopped bbq. The fried chicken which is golden and crispy and seasoned to perfection has great flavor.  The chopped bbq is made eastern Carolina style which is a vinegar based sauce with the perfect amount of heat from the red pepper for those who have never had it. I normally get the fries  and a side of Brunswick stew which is kinda like a beef stew with a hint of bbq sauce. Defiantly have to try it. 
They also sale fried shrimp that you can also get with a combo of bbq or fried chicken. Potato salad, coleslaw and hush puppies are also very popular side items.
They have great sweet tea and lemonade which the staff is always happy to refill when you cup is getting low. If you are planning a family gathering or a bbq they have large sides packages to accommodate you crowd size. Can't wait for them to open more locations in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Visited the drive thru on opening night. Got a chicken combo white and a chicken combo dark. The chicken itself was good for fast food. To my surprise the combo comes with pulled pork (eastern style). The drive thru menu is very vague. You need to be an insider to know what you are gonna get due to the menu not showing what's included in each type of combo, platter, etc. Hush puppies were half undercooked, half over cooked. They appeared to have been frozen together when put in the fryer. Overall just your average chicken joint."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The hush puppies are bomb!! If you love vinegar bases bbq sauce then you will love the BBQ chicken it is amazing, i can eat that sauce on anything! They have 2 versions a thicker one on the bbq chicken and more vinegar base for the pulled pork!! I love the hotdogs as well!!  The service was good! I'll def be back!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were exceptional! Everyone was very friendly and attentive! We had the Brunswick stew (if you buy one you get one for $1!) so glad Charlotte finally opened up this Smithfield's! We are so excited it's here!!"}
{"text":"New place!  Don't bother it was horrible. 
The only thing that was good was the cole slaw.  I ordered the white meat chicken plate. It looked amazing but it had no seasoning whatsoever.  The potato salad was polluted  by sugar.  Who puts sugar in potato salad???  My son ordered the shrimp platter and it was ok but the hush puppies and fries also very bland(do they season anything). The kicker was the banana pudding...... OMG it was absolutely Horrible. It was fake flavored  jello pudding.  Not a banana in sight. Hate I wasted my money.   #Oneanddone"}
{"text":"The new location at Rivergate is very conveniently located.  The restaurant is extremely clean and well organized. They have absolutely FREE coffee. Yes I said free. The staff is mostly young and pleasingly professional and pleasant. 
The fried chicken is good. Crispy snd juicy. I suppose the reduce the seasoning on the chicken bc they intend for toy to dip the chicken. If you dip chicken the seasoning was spot on however without the dip the chicken lacks flavors. I was not overly impressed by the bbq. It reminds me of Cookout's bbq with a higher price tag. This is not a bad thing because I enjoy Cookout's bbq. I did expect more from a bbq restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Smithfield's as I felt it would be unfair to review after one visit. I ordered the BBQ plate with Pulled Chicken, Cole slaw & hush puppies. I also ordered some baked beans on the side. Although the customer service was excellent both times, the food just isn't good....(in our opinion). I think the sweet tea was the best thing we had both times."}
{"text":"This place opened up fairly recently right by where I live, so I decided to check it out. It's definitely better than most of the fast food in the area, but I wasn't overly impressed. 

I got a combo platter with dark meat chicken. There fried chicken was pretty good. I enjoyed it. The pulled pork on the other hand was just ok. I love vinegar BBQ sauces, but I wasn't a big fan of theirs. It comes with two sides and hushpuppies. Unfortunately, I am on a lot carb diet and all of their sides are filled with carbs, so I didn't get to try any of them. They also don't let you substitute for an upcharge. I tried just a tiny bit of the coleslaw and beans and both were very sweet. The tiny piece of hushpuppy was just ok as well. 

The service is really fast. You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table. It only took about 5 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered. 

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but since I live close, I might come back."}
{"text":"Yummy  shrimp are better than Showmars! Nicest service people ever... unbelievable as it's technically fast food. Great stop after the mall stop."}
{"text":"I'm from \"Eastern North Carolina\" so I know barbecue!

We couldn't wait for this location to open and we weren't disappointed. A favorite spot from my Henderson, NC hometown, Smithfield's has mastered vinegar-based 'cue and fried chicken. 

The location is new so it's as clean as a whistle. Staff members were very warm, friendly and helpful to friends we brought along with us. 

I usually choose between a sandwich combo and the shrimp platter. Yes, shrimp at a barbecue spot can be tasty. The fries are shoestring and are to die for right out of the grease. Yes, grease. Pretty much everything is fried so if you're watching your waist, sit this one out. Or at least save your weight watchers points all week! Hubby usually gets a platter which comes with a generous portion of golden fried chicken, chopped barbecue and two sides. If you have kiddos in tow with larger appetites, throw in an extra chicken leg or tender because kids' meals only come with one each. 

Grab some sweet tea to go. There is nothing like their finely crushed ice!"}
{"text":"I so badly wanted to give this place a 5 star but couldn't because i wasn't a fan of the food at all. But what i will say is the people here are overly nice, and very accommodating! I had the pulled bbq sandwhich with fries.One thing i feel like can be brought to attention is maybe bringing the food out on trays. I looked around and notice some did have paper plates but apparently the sandwich's are brought out in just the wrapping i feel it will be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and sanitary when it comes to the food. I will try to give this place one more shot just because they won me over with the great customer service !!!! One more shot may win me over i will try something else the next go round."}
