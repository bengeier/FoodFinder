{"text":"Went in today and overheard the conversation with the owner and another patron where the owner used a homosexual slur to make fun of the person. While the owner having fun and making jokes and cursing at her customers is a part of her charm this was way incredibly overboard. The owner knew quickly that she was out of line because she left the restaurant and did not return until after the customers left. I will not be returning to support this establishment."}
{"text":"For a little hole in the wall grill, this place has some really good food.  I think they have the best burgers and hotdogs in Charlotte.  The club sandwich is so simple but sends your brain into euphoria when you bite into.  Peggy the owner is a trip and will tell you how it is.  Just remember before you leave, put your stool back in place or you will incur her wrath.  LOL"}
{"text":"I love Dixie Grill! It's a fun little place tucked away from all the hustle and bustle of your work day. Family owned and has great atmosphere!  Peggy the owner is one of the funniest ladies that will have you rolling out of your chair. Great food, great people, quick to order and lots of fun. I recommend it any day of the week! You have to try the Italian sub.... yummy! If you can stay and play around, you can always grab it to go! Call ahead! (704) 392-8828"}
{"text":"Excelled food!  Awesome atmosphere, owner Peggy is a sharp-tongued Boston lady who firmly believes the customer is not always right. Don't be offended, it's all part of the charm. Try and burger with \"au jus\" treatment, the philly, or the Italian sandwich."}
{"text":"When here a couple of times with guys from work . Good place but I probably won't be back seen the lady that cooks drop a piece of toast on the floor picked it back up and butter it then put on the plate that went out to a customer. I said something she didn't care I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a million times and went in for the first time today.  It was fantastic!  One long table with stools so be prepared to sit near your neighbors.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I took some friends to the Dixie Grill & Grocery today and had to warn them before we got there that they were most likely going to be yelled at.  I was glad I did.  Peggy likes to make sure that her customers are taken care of - and that they know to follow the rules.  Put your stools back under the table, put your trays back in the pile and throw your garbage away.  She tried to chase down three kids that didn't follow the rules.  I've only ordered the cheesesteak & fries, but my friends had hot dogs, chicken parm, italian subs & burgers - all said they were good.  Service isn't speedy - but Peggy makes sure that it gets out in a timely fashion.  I wouldn't go grocery shopping here, although there is a beer cave, they don't really stock many groceries."}
{"text":"wonderful escape to the past is what it feels like - a diamond in the rough"}
{"text":"Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at, cursed at, watched ppl get punched, and had a very good cheeseburger at the same time. It was a lot of fun. The burger was really good for a grill & the homemade chips were off the charts! The grill was filled with men who enjoyed being yelled at by the female owner! Good times & good food! Don't take young kids"}
{"text":"I've been living in this neighborhood for over a year now. Every day I drive by this place to go to work but never stopped by to try them out. Well, it finally happened. They are like a small grocery store that you go when you don't feel like driving all the way to the grocery store. They also have snacks and drinks. Their menu is not extensive but it is enough if you are hungry and looking for something fast and cheap. I went with chicken wings and fried cheese sticks and my husband went with hamburger with fried pickles. My cheese sticks were not impressive, I would order them again, however my wings were pretty good, tasted just like home made wings. My husband enjoyed his meal. I feel like if you are in a hurry or don't feel like cooking this is a good place to have as an option."}
{"text":"Dixie Grill is a hidden gem that is the type of place featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Family owned makes it extra personable and special.  All the food is great.  I have never had anything bad and Donna makes the BEST BLT EVA!"}
{"text":"i got a text today asking if i wanted to do lunch. When i asked where, the reply was, \"it's a food place...I think...but we might turn around and leave once we get there.\" As we are driving down that road that goes by the new runway of the airport, i see a sign for Dixie's Grill to the right. It seemed to be directing us to a place where you would not expect an eating establishment, but there it was. It doesn't look like much and really it isn't much. But they have a grill and a nice little menu with friendly folks working. On Thursday they just happened to have the BBQ sandwich on special with fries and a tea for $4.95.  It was pretty good stuff.   The 'grocery' items are sparse and while i expected to see Pepsi cans with the old school packaging and not the throwback version, i was pleasantly surprised to find the new 1st degree Doritos. Of note, they do have a walk in beer cooler. From a glance, you will find little if any outside of the domestic standards.   Not so much a destination eatery, but if you live out in West Charlotte, they served a pretty good meal. With my expectations based on appearance and location, this place turned out to be a gem."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak was awesome. Owner Ms. Peggy came on a little strong at first for my liking but she is a character and a cool lady. This place is a total dive but the food is great and its cheap. It's out of the way and easy to miss but it's worth a trip to check it out."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest resturaunt ive ever been to & has great & delicious foods."}
{"text":"I've read the great yelp reviews and decided to try it for myself. Now this place is really out of the way. Winding back road near the airport. So you really gotta make an effort to come here if you don't work near the airport.  Walking in I kinda felt like I was going back in time. It really has that southern feel to it. I made sure to stay in plain sight, so that I wouldn't relive \"My cousin Vinny\"  My order was taken by a woman who I could tell was sizing me up right as i walked in. being that it was my first time here I asked who I assume is the owner what she would recommend.  She said \"burger\". So a burger it will be!  Took about 10 minutes to get my food. I didn't smell any fired beef which I thought was weird. When Place is known for a particular food, I think you should be able to smell that specialty even before walking in. So I got my food and ate in my car like I normally do. The onion rings were really good. Big thick slices.   I unwrapped my burger and it looked really good. Well put together. Side note, the wrapping was cool to the touch. Which I found strange. When I bit into it, I wasn't blown away. It was a nice burger, but I can't say it was a great burger. The temperature was warm, which I don't understand because they cooked it in front of me.  I've found a ton of great places on yelp because of great reviews, but I don't believe this was one of them. I do respect the small businessperson and recommend supporting them. So if you agree with that, skip the large chains and grab a burger from a mom and pop."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday and the lady, I guess Peggy was telling people they had to move for some of the regulars!    Seems to take care of people, told me she was sorry if she had scared me, the hot dogs were really good, and the regular customers were very sweet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We stopped here after arriving from the airport. The Philly and Shrimp Po' Boy were fantastic, and on really good, fresh bread. Mom got the Dixie Dog, smothered in chili, French fries, and cheese sauce. Onion rings are hand- battered. Sandwich, rings, and tea for $7.50."}
{"text":"Great place off the beaten path.  Food is fresh, staff is fun, and it is a neat historic family friendly facility.  This is not a chain nor a fancy joint.  It is a down to earth venue.  I've been going there for several years."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough! It's the kind of place where some people may overlook but they would be missing out. The star of the show here is the burger! My boyfriend loves the \"dip shit double\" which has two burgers, cheese and a fried egg. That's all he gets and says this is, by far, one of the best burgers he has ever had. He also loves the fried pickles. I like the burger also, but also like the buffalo chicken wrap. My favorite menu item is the homemade chips, which are always made fresh.   The people who work here are super friendly. The prices are beyond reasonable.   Tip: get your meal to go and drive a little down the road to the airport overlook."}
{"text":"Everything i've had here is good. I highly recommend the burgers! So Good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got introduced to this place by my co-worker... it's a street side old convenience store looking place by the airport, completed with the \"Pepsi\" store sign that says Dixie Grill & Grocery.  So it looks \"questionable,\" but let me assure you that they do serve food here.  We normally go on Wednesdays (um hum, today) for the cheeseburger lunch special... for $5.25 you get a cheeseburger (I get mine with chili & slaw), side and tea.  The other lunch specials through the week are: Monday 2 hot dogs, Tuesday chicken tenders, Wednesday cheeseburger, Thursday BBQ, Friday porkchop sandwich and Sunday Dixie dog (not sure what that consist of).  I normally get onion rings as my side, but the tater wedges are great too.  Personally the owner lady is the highlight of the visit.  She's this feisty older lady who sometimes has a different sense of hospitality (especially toward the male patrons).  But to me, she's always nice and sweet.  I like this place... for similar price, I would much rather enjoy my burger here than any fast food joint.  It has characters, make a great quick lunch place.  And that beer walk-in chest is very tempting during lunch :)"}
{"text":"The food and service were great.  We each got a cheeseburger, Wednesday special, with an order of onion rings and fries.  The burger was just a great down home burger.  The onion rings, I think beer battered, were awesome.  And the fries are think cut crinkle fries, almost a cross between steak fries and regular fries.  Everything was delicious."}
