{"text":"I have been to Jewish delis' in Montreal ,Toronto and New York and this place can't compare. Until you have been to a true Jewish Deli back east you will never know! No baby beef, no knishes? Sorry this place just doesn't compare. The smoked meat sandwich I got was soggy with way too much mustard. Not very good."}
{"text":"This one of the best smoke meat sandwich delis I found  in Calgary. Their sandwiches have the authentic Montreal style flavour you expect when you bite into a loaded sandwich. Just the right amount of meat &mustard on the right kind of rye bread.  
They have a reqular style poutine loaded with real cheese curds and a yummy gravy, also another loaded with chunks of smoke meat.
Atmosphere is great with friendly staff. A little  bit of Montréal away from home.
Check out their menu for more great options  available."}
{"text":"If you're craving montreal smoked meat in Calgary, this is the place to go. They serve authentic montreal smoked meat at Palace of Eats. Apparently, they source their meat from the same place as where Ben's in Montreal used to get it from. 

You can get either the traditional montreal smoked meat sandwich (steamed smoked meat on rye bread with a choice of mustard) or their reuben sandwiches (which includes sauerkraut and cheese on toasted rye bread in addition to the smoked meat, of course). I've had both versions of the sandwiches and both are great. The reuben is perfectly toasted and crispy on the outside.

They also serve smoked salmon lox and cream cheese on a bagel but this one I haven't tried so I have no comments on this one.

All sandwiches come with chips, a pickle and some coleslaw. This place can get quite busy during the lunch hour. They also offer a turkey sandwich and a grilled cheese sandwich as well for those that don't want smoked meat.

For beverages, they offer a variety of old-fashioned sodas. My favourite is the black cherry soda to go with montreal smoked meat. I kind of discovered this pairing accidentally while I was in Montreal at Schwartz's. 

If you want to buy just the smoked meat to take home, it is available for about $12 a pound, which is not too bad as I was paying around $10 a pound for the whole brisket in Montreal earlier this summer. You can buy the meat sliced or unsliced."}
{"text":"It's like being at a smoke meat restaurant in Montréal. The look and the smell...very nice.  And the taste!? Excellent!! They even have their own mustard blend as well as a few other mustard choices. The only thing missing was the dill pickle! 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Raised on Dunn's & Schwartz's smoked meat (and the odd La Belle Province Smoked Meat). As a self-professed expert on the subject (I once hauled a Schwartz's brisket on my lap on a flight to Calgary), I went in with low expectations. I shudder when recalling my boyfriend cooking me what he thought was 'Smoked Meat' and the various claims of \"Montreal Smoked Meat\" I encountered years ago when I arrived in Calgary. Palace of Eats (now Myhre's Deli) is the real deal. Eat here. This is the real thing. Also great place to meet Ex-pats from Montreal"}
{"text":"Agree with previous assessments that this is the best smoked meat sandwich in Calgary.  They offer a couple options with your sandwich with the choice of a pickle, cup of coleslaw or chips.  The dining room takes you back to a simpler time with cozy booths and a bar.  Current special is a sandwich and a beer for $10 which is great deal, considering how spectacular the contents between the bread is.  Super fast and friendly service. 

Just go, stop putting it off and you'll leave with a smile."}
{"text":"If u love real Montreal smoked meat myhre's is the only place besides Montreal that I have found the same delicious melt in mouth flavor amazing food amazing staff will be back"}
{"text":"A week into Stampede and I'm completely carbed-out!  Perfect time for a good smoked meat outing. As a Francophone Montrealer, my family & friends were not into the thinly shaved Schwartz type stuff so I asked the waitress for a thick cut boss, light on the dijon.  What came was a piled high salty, juicy, silky, delicious sandwich that would pump iron and protein back into the toughest Cowboy!! As good as back home :). Now, if the sandwiches came standard thick cut and my husband's ruben was cooked on a flat top rather than in a panini press, I'd probably give it five stars!"}
{"text":"Terrific montreal smoked meat sandwich. .......and NEW on the menu fries.......thought I was in montreal.......that's how good the food is at Myhre's Deli. 
The balance of the menu is typical montreal deli fare.....and I plan on trying all of it......"}
{"text":"i did enjoy this place and the sandwich was pretty tasty. the thing for me was that it took an extremely long time for our order to be ready. but i will visit again since i often do crave reuben sandwiches."}
{"text":"Small menu, but quality eats. I had the turkey sandwich and my date had a Reuben. I preferred the turkey sandwich, but that's because I don't really like Montreal Smoked meat. My main complaint is the price. Two sammys and drinks came to $32 for lunch - a little steep for a sammy lunch in my opinion. 

Also,  on a bit of a tangent - we went to another deli in Marda Loop a few months ago, that is exactly the same - I had the chicken pesto sandwich there and my date had the grilled cheese. While we were eating at Myrhe's Deli we were talking about how we had already had this before, hadn't we? But looking it up I think the place in Marda loop is called \"Avenue Deli\". Its exactly the same: same menu, same slaw, same pickle, same chips.... A quick look at Myrhe's website reveals that it must be. On the bottom of the page, there are links for: Belmont Diner, Avenue Deli ,Chuckwagon Cafe, Galaxie Diner and Island Cruising. I imagine that they are all connected/related!  Makes more sense now - also makes sense that Belmont diner is well known for their smoked meat breakfast dishes. Actually, their website is pretty awesome, you should take a peak. I also learned that the meat they use is supplied by Montreal-based Quebec Smoked Meats...and that concludes my trivia tangent!"}
{"text":"To be honest MD doesn't look like much outside. Through the window, I really couldn't tell if it was a diner, deli or restaurant. Throwing caution to the wind and seeing a sign for a $7 smoked meat special (that's what she said), I figured why not give it a try. Inside the diner/cafeteria confusion was still in play. At first I was not sure whether to sit down to be served or to go up to the register to order. Guess I should of asked. However, I don't think anybody really cares here so I sat down and the guy took my order. I ordered the smoked meat special with coleslaw and dijon mustard. Delicious. Meaty. Juicy. Vegetables. Mayo. Satisfied. Filled. Happy. Out the door.

It's a pretty cool place which has been in business for 7 years now, so they must be doing something right. Great sit down and go place. A little embarrassed that this was my first time here. After all I do live in the area."}
{"text":"WOW! Awesome staff, awesome location, awesome service and awesome food! If there was a sixth star...

I saw their sign on the way home from work on Friday and popped inside, but they were closing already. I wanted to try the poutine, as I consider myself a bit of a poutine connoisseur. Oh well right?

No, not \"oh well.\" Having me walk away was not good enough. I'm not sure if he was the manager or what but a gentleman chased me down on the side-walk with a gift certificate!

I popped in today (Saturday) and ate inside. The poutine is delicious. French fries are crisp, gravy is rich and actually suitable for poutine. It never fails to amaze me how many places can't pull off a poutine. Myhre's can pull off a poutine.

The inside looks like a classic diner. They have glass bottles of coke, and serve the food in little baskets to add to the ambiance. I was impressed with the décor. 

Well done!!"}
{"text":"Great taste and value. I'm from Montreal and think that this is one of the best places to get poutine or smoked meat in the city, and the prices are very reasonable.

I found the staff to be very friendly and sociable and enjoyed the time there."}
{"text":"Best Montreal smoked meat in Calgary that I'm aware of - nice and juicy.

The only downside is that they include a small paper cup of potato chips with the sandwich rather than a side of fresh-cut and crispy french fries. 

If you own Myhre's Deli, and are reading this of course, please rectify this situation ASAP.  Your reward will be placement on my list of best places to eat in Calgary."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm one of the few lucky Calgarians that gets to travel to Montreal for work a couple times a year and when that happens, what do I always think, GIDDIE UP TASTE BUDS.  of course when I first started traveling there, Montreal Smoked Meat, Bagels, and Poutine were what I I heard about and needed to find (trust me - Montreal offers so much more for food!!!!).   That being said my journey started with Schwartz's as it's on of the 'most notable'.   It was really good, but I had a long time workmate who lives and grew up in Montreal recommend the Main Deli across the street - I found it equally good without the wait.

Now introduce Calgary.  I first went to Myrhe's when it was called Palace of Eats, named after a diner on Calgary's Stephen Ave that lasted a long time.  Not sure why the name change but I preferred Palace of Eats as a name.  Regardless the smoked meat sandwiches are the same - quite a few options of mustards - and basically a really awesome sandwich.  I would like to know where they get their smoked meat from and plan to ask next time I'm there.

They also serve Nathan's Hot Dogs - I love a good dog now and then, haven't had one here but have had Nathan's in the States - plan to be trying one here soon!!!.

Add some pics of my latest lunch.

Happy Full Belly Everyone!

{"text":"If you want a taste of deliciousness  then head on down to MYHRE'S Deli!!! We tried the Montreal Smoked meat and the Reuben.. fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Great Montreal-smoked beef sandwiches that hearken back to the 70s when one could get such thick, delicious and moistly-delightful sandwiches almost anywhere where kosher and generosity prevailed!

You just can't lose with the Montreal smoked-meat sandwiches. Even for their medium-sized sandwich there's a good portion of tender really authentic meat. 
The breads could be definitely improved, but the rye is passable. 
Fries are very good and stacked higher than most of us can eat.
The guys running the place are casual, very accommodating and make a lasting impression for changing anything before the meal arrives at one's table. A large dill pickle on the side with more than one mustard sets your meal off most pleasantly.
If their pastrami and other meats are as good, can't lose!
As well, they are a sister company with Galaxi Diner next door, and so you can't lose at whichever venue you choose to dine in.
Go here for 'a best-of' Mtl smoked meat meal. 
And you will walk out stuffed."}
{"text":"This place ascribes to my motto, \" Whatever you do, do it well\". They dont do too much at the Palace of Eats except make damn good sandwiches.
In actual fact the real name of this place is Myhres Deli ( named after the owner), but most people just refer it to the Palace of Eats.  Apparently  the  wooden walls and booths were inspired by Wilensky's, a Montreal landmark immortalized in Mordecai Richler's novel, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz It is pretty small in here, so you may want to time your visit to ensure you get a table. 
.Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwiches are the star of this place, but they also have:

A Reuben Sandwich
Bagel with Lox
BC Smoked Salmon, Cream cheese, red onion, and capers
Roasted Turkey Sandwich
Pesto Chicken Sandwich
Grilled Cheese

The prices are reasonable and all the sandwiches come with a side of coleslaw and potato chips. I ordered the normal size and it was plenty big enough for me.    Its places like this that make a city have character and charm, simple hidden away gems. 
The young guys that work here are efficient and pleasant.  Parking can be tough, so if you can avoid the lunch rush you should. 

Next door is the Galaxie Diner, which also gets hopping. 
Check out this place if you are missing a good Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich.  
PS they have alot of great mustards!"}
{"text":"Unreal smoked meat. Love everything about this place. Easily one of my favourite lunch spots in the city. The sandwich cuts can be a ridiculously generous helping of smoked meat, topped off with a delicious root beer and poutine. This place is amazing. Don't forget to get a stick of double bubble after you eat!"}
{"text":"The Palace of Eats was good in its own right, but it was not comparable to Montreal Smoked Meat from Montreal.  For my full review, click here:

http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2037445/palace_of_eats_in_calgary_makes_a_good.html?cat=9"}
{"text":"whole bunch of guys, the house mustard was ok, nothing to write home about.  The meat was sliced proper and the sandwich was a bit of a ripoff for the size, off 17th ave prices.  if you can make it out to the NE king of subs does the same thing for cheap"}
{"text":"I just dined here for the first time. I am NOT a sandwich fan. I don't tend to go out of my way to have a sandwich. However I AM a fan of big meaty meals. This venue was recommended to me by various individuals. Upon entering the establishment I asked for the best thing on the menu. They recommended the Reuben. That's what I had. The only thing that identifies this meal as a sandwich is the two slices of bread stuffed with a mountain of Montreal Smoked Meat, cheese, sauerkraut and some fantastic mustard! The best Reuben that I've ever had! The slaw that came with it was pretty good too. Sit at the window if you can for maximum comfort and lots of natural light."}
{"text":"Good, but $11.75 +tax for just a turkey sandwich and half a pickle(no side)? $12.75 +tax for a montreal smoked meat poutine? Too overpriced,  so I wouldn't recommend.  There's a deli/bakery 2 blocks away with soup & sandwich for $10"}
{"text":"I had a craving for a really good Reuben Sandwich. After reading my fellow Yelper's opinions about  Myrhe's Deli I decided to give then a try. They did make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches I  have had. It was so good that I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat to have later, and even though it had been in the fridge for a few hours, it still was delicious, and I think this is due to the mustard and bread they have use."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here the other day.. Loved the atmosphere! Not too busy. Sort of a vintage Irish pub kind of decor?

Had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich (first time I've tried it!) with coleslaw. Mustard is made in-house and it's delicous! VERY picky when it comes to coleslaw, but I could have eaten a bucket full! I wonder if they would give me a tub to take home? Haha.

Fun, friendly and cute staff never hurts ;)"}
{"text":"I was yearning for a Schwartz Montreal smoked meat sandwich the other day and complaining that Calgary didn't have any.  But much to my surprise! I found a joint that not only serves it up but has it flown in briquettes directly from Montreal.

The Palace of Eats has some of the freshest Montreal smoked beef this side of Winnipeg, 10 to 14 dollars gives you 6 to 10 ounces of Montreal goodness. My 12 dollars sandwich was about 5 inches thick, served on fresh rye bread and with a house mustard mix dressing.

Here you can eat in but you can also take out too, I have heard good gossip that conferences have called in 20 to 50 sandwiches at a time for pick up here.

There are also other yummy options, salmon lox on a bagel, pesto chicken and six choices of mustard.

I was pretty happy, the only thing lacking are the crispy fries and large picked dills I am so used to when eating in Montreal."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about a smoked meat place. All they do is smoked meat and they do it very, VERY well.

I'm a native Montrealer and every few weeks I get a craving for a smoked meat sandwich.

At Myrhe's, they do it proper. The rye bread exists only to tell you where the meat begins and ends. By halfway through, the bread has disintegrated and you're in meant heaven.

With a selection of mustards (my favorite is the house flavour) to chose from, and a good selection of sizes, the food is delish, and everything a smoked meat sandwish should be.

The atmosphere is clean, and inviting, with either booths inside or a nice park across the street for summer time picnics. 

If you're a fan of good smoked meat and don't mind paying a bit of a premium for a sandwich, this is a fantastic place to try."}
{"text":"Two fistfuls of juice dripping Montreal smoked meat? YES
Fresh thick slices of bread to hold the monster together? YES
Awesome selection of mustard flavors? YES

So much meat. So much awesome. 
Then they even throw in chips, coleslaw, and slam it in a basket.
Nuff said."}
{"text":"Oh sandwiches, how do I love thee?

There isn't a great deal of selection at Myrhe's Deli, but man can they make a mean sandwich. Earlier this year, I stopped in for a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich and ordered it to go. It took a few minutes to make it, but then it was packed into a sturdy little box with the coleslaw, some chips and a pickle. I ate it in the park right across the street. It made for a lovely summer lunch!

More recently, I stopped in for a Pesto Chicken sandwich. Also delicious, and also served with coleslaw, some chips and a pickle. There's no messing around with the coleslaw either. It's crisp, it's fresh, it's sprinkled with pepper and not slathered in creamy dressing, but rather in a delightful more Italian tasting dressing. Mmm!

Stop in for a sandwich, or order yourself a whole pound of Montreal Smoked Meat and make your own!"}
{"text":"In the quest for an excellent Reuben my wife and I have tried a number of places, but I think we've found our new favorite.

Tucked away opposite a park on 11th street is Myhre's Deli, which according to my wife is very reminiscent of traditional delis she visited in Montreal, lots of warm-tone woodworking and cozy benches.

We both ordered the large Reuben, which according to the waitress differs from the small in the amount meat and sauerkraut used. There's a choice of 7 mustards; my wife got Keens (hot) while I chose the house blend. Both of us are now of the opinion that the house blend has a better flavour and bite.

As for amount of food, just look at the picture; those coke bottles are the glass 355ml ones, to give it a frame of reference.

The meat? So very soft that it fell apart in our mouths, tender and juicy are barely enough to describe them.  The sauerkraut was crisp and flavorful without being overwhelming.

We will definitely be back the next time we crave a well-made Reuben."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that I LOVE sandwiches.  I would call myself a bit of a sandwich connoisseur and though I've heard of Myrhe's before I've never been.

I had the turkey sandwich (comes with havarti and a roasted red pepper mayo). This sandwich was pure comfort food - melty, meaty, grilled bread awesomeness.  It came packed in a little box with a pickle, coleslaw, and potato chips.  The pickle and the coleslaw were in their own little containers so as not to compromise the integrity of the toasting process and sog of the sandwich.  Nice touch.

The only drawback is the price - $12 is a bit high for a moderately sized sandwich.  I will definitely go back, but probably not as often due to the cost.  Oh, and I got my lunch to go, but if you're looking to meet dudes, this place is a sausage party, I was the only women in there....hehehe :)"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, good beer, and awesome employees! Thank you Aaron for the company while I was killing time! If I'm ever back in Calgary I'll be sure to stop back in."}
{"text":"Actually I like this place.  My rating for this place is actually 3.5 stars out of 4, but can't seem to get yelp to 1/2 star things.  The meat is tender, and they use a Montreal processor (not one of the superstar ones, but still good).  I find the meat a little too salted, but still, they add the nice touch of adding bubble gum and a pretty decent cole slaw with the sandwich.  If I closed my eyes and dined there, I would say it would be easily about as good as a late night Chenoy's sandwich, or a Dunn's one back in Montreal (for those in the know).  I get their $7 afternoon special every other month (as it's just down the street from me), and always come out more or less \"Montrealized\" for another while or so.  For the lunch crowd primarily, it's a great little place for a take out and a snack."}
{"text":"Amazing montreal smoked meat, hot dogs and poutine, including 7 types of mustard. Totally authentic with super friendly staff. A must try, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Myhre's on the suggestion of Yelp and was not disappointed. Had to work around the place for a week before I had time and it was TORTURE. Alas, Friday, and I dig into the Classic Cut. The meat is a little moist and will destroy the bread but it is fantastic meat. The joint is pretty casual, with a quasi-classic feel. It's also very small so don't bring the whole office unless your office is a party of 3 or your renting out the restaurant. Plenty of drinks from the fridge and beer behind the counter - that is if you aren't on the clock... Like I was. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of sides, some basic fries and MASSIVE pickles(!), but let's be clear here, Myhre's is all about the Montreal Smoked Meat and that's what you're going for. You will not be disappointed."}
