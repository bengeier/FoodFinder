{"text":"When a reservation was made on the fly by a colleague to try out the relatively new resto, I couldn't help but jump at the chance. The decor is beautiful and set a lovely ambiance right away and the front of house staff moves perfectly, like clockwork. Dishes were whisked away as soon as the food vanished from our plates and glasses were refilled before we realised they were empty. The wine selection is impeccable, but expect to shell out for a bottle-- there were few options under $50.00. 

We dined omakase (multi-course meal where dishes are chosen by the chef) and were given detailed descriptions of each course by the chef, himself, who was even so kind as to make separate versions of dishes for me, the only pescatarian of the group. We had the Jatoba salad with lobster pieces, spice-crusted beef carpaccio, a variety of sashimi from Albacore to Blue fin, another course of every type of dumplings, gigantic pieces of succulent shrimp tempura, seared scallops in browned butter, ginger lobster with grilled gai lan, and my coworkers even had the beef with grilled foie gras, while I opted for the buttery grilled king oyster mushrooms.  

Each dish was a marriage of fresh and interesting flavour profiles, with classic additions such as grilled shishito pepper and pickled daikon to dwarf peaches and cucumber mixed with the lovely texture of roe and the melt-in-your-mouth fish. Delicate flavours were preserved, yet paired with bold tastes which would please even the most discerning of palates.

Even the desserts were exquisite; although none of the eight of us has a particularly sweet tooth, we couldn't turn away the last course, which was plates of the mango curd tart with meringue brulé and green apple sorbet and a great take on the humble but delectable pouding chomeur topped with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberries. 

In all of my experience dining out, I can easily say this was one of the top three meals I've ever had. I tip my hat to chef Olivier Vigneault."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience (choose the bar seats!)L'environnement est particulièrement bien designé, à l'image des plats, aussi delicieux que bien presenté. Excellent service du début à la fin. La serveuse était vraiment sympatique et étonnament utile quant au choix de plats. Elle nous a très bien conseillé et nous a permis d'apprécier l'enchaînement des assiettes bien calculé et particulièrement bien agencé !
 A real must! I'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had lunch, the food was good but very pricey. The portions too small. My colleagues and I had to go for something else after as we were all still hungry."}
{"text":"being turned down right in front of the door, it was really unpleasant experience. you should make sure the NO KIDS sign in every of your restaurant advertisement even for tourists . some tourists walk and look for the direction hard enough and tired enough with hungry toddlers to find that you not accepting any kids. maybe it would nicer if you understand what our feeling at that time by recommending other place nearby so that we don't need to spend browsing a new place to eat!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in town. 
Amazing food from beginning to end.
Service is impeccable
The decor inside and out is unique to montreal."}
{"text":"Very nice japanese restaurant downtown Montreal. The space is gorgeous and they have an outdoor part as well. Service was excellent. I came here with some work colleagues. The atmosphere is kind of fancy, not too casual. We got the brussel sprouts chips and edamame as a starter, both delicious. I also ordered the roasted bass with zucchini and it was perfectly cooked and flavourful. Chocolate cake for dessert, which tasted really good as well. Price per person can come to 40-70$."}
{"text":"One of the best in MTL great atmosphere and the food is amazing always fresh fish and amazing drinks if you like Asian fusion check it out !! The chef is the nicest guy and he is so talented"}
{"text":"Not quite satisfied for the Price

My friend and I arrived promptly for our 7p reservation on Saturday. The decor is very pretty/sexy. Waitresses wear cute dresses with belt bags. 

We were told the menu was designed to share. However we were somewhat disappointed to see the portions were quite small and my friend and I were both still a little hungry after our meal but not excited enough to order more. 

We started with the dumplings. Mehhhh
Next up was the mango salad. Delish but really for one person. 
Tuna tataki which was crusted in Tempura and not much flavor. Tempura is not my favorite so maybe don't trust me if you love it. But the tuna was bland. 
And our entree was the Lamb dish. Tastes but they took our spoons and it is not a dish that you can eat with chopsticks. 
I think we needed rice or something but couldn't wrap our heads around the double digit price. The waitress assured us we had enough but it wasn't. 

It gets very crowded, loud and tight in space."}
{"text":"I had high expectations about this restaurant from the reviews , the starter of eggplant purée dampling was ok but the cresson that came with it was loaded to the max with salt so I stayed waiting for the sea bass my main dish , the main dish of sea bass  was full of salty tomatoes and the fish consisted of around 2 fingers of this sea monster which was also crunchy from salt ,, so I ended up enjoying the tomatoes which were not even marinated with olive oil but with some oil ! My friends had very tiny dishes of something called sea food like tuna slices portions cut for the birds not for humans !Then came my dessert it was supposed to be meringue but was instead of meringue like a white omelette for cholesterol dieters,  soft instead of crunchy and disgusting 
filled with some old fruits and topped with sorbet ,, I ate the sorbet only ! What a shame !!i came home to order a pizza!"}
{"text":"First day in Montreal and we went here on recommendation of concierge. Every dish was knockout. Our waitress was wonderful and she recommended excellent wines. We ordered the ultra dumplings, shrimp teriyaki, a maki roll, a side of Chinese eggplant, and veal. Each dish was phenomenal - we capped it off with a lemon dessert that was light and fresh and perfect way to end. The flavors were excellent, wonderful ambience, and lovely service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking this is some kind of hidden high end gem right downtown think again. I didn't necessarily have a bad experience here but it was also nothing special. The place is pretty big, between the front room and the terrace, and seems setup more like a \"pack in the lawyers at lunch and charge 'em an arm and a leg\" place rather than a fine dining establishment. The dumplings were disappointing, and the sashimi and maki were passable. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I must say, if it wasn't for the absolutely arrogant and classless manager, I wouldn't even bother writing a post. If there is one thing I know about... Its food. I've been to the best restaurants all over the world, but I have never seen such an unprofessional person in my life! We were 5 people and our bill was around 650$ with tip. I can agree that most of the food was good... But their raw fish is absolutely discusting. It tasted soooooo fishy and when i brought this to their attention i was told that this manager was going to come and speak to us but he never did because he was too lazy to get up and do his job properly. And when i saw that they didnt remove these items that didnt even add up to 45$ off the insane bill I was shocked. They didnt even appologize. In fact, the manager argued with me and told me that I didnt know what I was talking about... Even when 5 other people agreed that the fish was DISCUSTING AND FISHY. He also told us he didnt care if we come back or not. Clearly this guy has no idea how to treat his clients and doesnt value his customers. Ive been to hundreds if restaurants and I am not one to complain or even write a review, but This was inevitable. Even at cheap restaurants if you dont likee something they take it off the bill because they want you to be happy or at least they offer you a drink or dessert. This guy is so money hugry he was more worried about removing 45$ than thinking of what great clients we could be in the long run. I eat sushi almost 3-4 times a week at places such as ryu, park, etc... So I know what fresh fish tastes like. They will never see me there again!! And someone wrote a comment saying that this place makes u feel like youre not in montreal... I live in Toronto where they actually have good food and service... And trust me this place made me feel exactly like I was in montreal, because only in montreal are they oblivious to the good service required in a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Jatoba is a tremendous addition to the downtown dining scene, which is dire need of variety beyond the chain restaurants. Very fresh and tasty plates, very good price-to-quality ratio - the lunch menu is well-worth it for those not looking to splash out too much. 

I've enjoyed the pan-seared tuna, salmon sashimi and beef teriyaki, all done to perfection. The dumplings could be among the best in Montreal. Chef Olivier Vigneault is raising the bar.

The desserts - by pastry chef Kimberly Estrada of Some Kind of Wonderful - are unique: From the Suki blondie bar to the Japanese cotton cheesecake, you can't go wrong! I just wish they had kept the mango tart on the menu, it was incredible. 

My only criticism is that lunch service could be a little faster. But the decor and stylish remodelling of the interior makes it a location worth hanging out in..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Excellent service, thank you Audrey for a great night. I would highly recommend Jatoba to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Fancy Asian fusion spot. Pricey but definitely worth it. Menu is special, diverse and food is of the highest quality. Good place for a date, a dinner with friends or even business lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles, and this restaurant was fabulous and by far the best restaurant I tried in Montreal, yet they were all great. Everything from this restaurant was great. The entrance the vibe and the style of it. The food was marvelous and the service was great, Matt was our service and recommended amazing dishes especially the caramel dessert."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday for lunch. Overall, a very enjoyable experience!
First off, the decoration of the place matched my dream condo : wood, bricks, and green plants. It was beautiful, very modern! Loved it!
The crowd there was all business people, seeing as we were there for lunch and it is located downtown.
The service was excellent; we didn't wait too long for our plates, compared to other restaurants in the area that have a very slow service during lunch hours because of the rush. The waiters were very friendly, with smiles on their faces the whole time. We were thanked by three different waiters when we left!
The lunch menu has nice options at an reasonable price and they come with a bowl of salad and a bowl of noodles to start. I took the Jatoba salad which was very good; the salmon sashimi in it was very tasty. My boyfriend had the beef teriyaki on rice and veggies; it was really good and cooked perfectly. I have to say that I preferred my boyfriend's dish, but it might've been because I was very hungry and wanted some meat. Anyway, we exchanged our plates with each other halfway through, so in the end, I was satisfied!
The dessert menu looked really good and creative, but it was too pricey for a lunch so we skipped that part of the meal (anyway, I had already planned a dessert for the birthday boy!).
I will definitely come back for supper to try different dishes and all the desserts! 
PS: This is a good place for business suppers."}
{"text":"Great decor, friendly staff but slow service. Everything was well presented but unfortunately the food itself was only mediocre. The portion is also very small. The bill came out to about $100/person and most of our guests would have been more satisfied dining elsewhere. All in all, it's a nice trendy place to hang out, but don't except much from the food."}
{"text":"Woah! Been in MtL for 3 years and had no idea this place existed! How is that possible?!? I'm always googling around for nice restaurants in downtown. How I passed this place up is beyond me.

FYI - this place is quite bougey. But I love it. Great people watching and fantastic decor and ambiance! We sat in the terrasse area. 

The food was amazing. Best dumplings and dessert I ever had. Can't wait to go back!!! Cocktail menu on point!!"}
{"text":"Jatoba is the much hyped addition to downtown Montreal. Located inside a large building without an obvious signs, the restaurant is vast with a beautiful terrace out back.  The decor and ambiance are very nice and welcoming.  The service is excellent with no less than 3 people waiting on your table.  I would give it 5 stars just for the service and decor.  

The food is what brings this place down.  We ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings to start.  They were mediocre at best. There are better, more authentic dumplings anywhere in Chinatown but again, you won't get the nice terrace or a server wiping down your table mid meal.

The brussell sprout chips were my favorite. They were light an crispy but fell short of anything more than a snack.  Finally, out starters ended with a very very disappointing seaweed salad.  The dressing was bland and lacked the traditional seaweed salad found in almost all of the Japanese restaurants in the area.  

I ordered the chicken and my colleague ordered the sea bass as our mains.  My chicken was 2 skewers of dry chunks of chicken in a mysterious brown sauce.  For $24, I would expect an actual piece of chicken with crispy skin (as described in the menu).  This was almost inedible.  The bass was good with large chunks of tomato. The vegetable fried rice was disgusting.  Broken grains of rice in what looked like a mixture of rice and frozen peas.  There was no flavor and the rice was dry.  

I'm not sure what this place is aiming for because it's not quite Asian.  The venue is gorgeous but the food is terrible.  There are many other options for fine Asian fusion in MTL and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Le menu dégustation nous a permis de découvrir plusieurs éléments du menu. La morue est un must  & n'oublier pas de prendre un dessert! 
Excellent service!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Japanese restaurant in town!
What could you ask for more : Nothing! Great service, wine list, food is perfect!
The gyozas, salads are amazing. Fish? The best and freshest you can find outside of an ocean village. 

Nice open setting. Could get a bit loud, but ok if not too busy. 

Only little culprit is the price, very high, with few option on the low side. 


But at this high level of quality, it's worth it if you can afford."}
{"text":"My colleagues in Montreal were gushing about the quality of the sushi here. We came for a business lunch. We had them order for us, and they brought an assortment of apps and sushi. The food was all decent, but the fish quality wasn't where it could be. Had much better sushi elsewhere, although in Montreal I have not, so maybe I am being too harsh on them.

The service was great, and the ambiance was decent, but slightly dated."}
{"text":"What a wonderful night on the terrace at Jatoba.  We started off with drinks recommended by our waiter and they were a hit. I got the Spicy Foo Pim's cup with wasabi, lime juice, ginger beer and lemon grass and hubby got a bourbon Ewa Warhawk drink that was to die for.  

We started off with the sashimi platter.  The Chef brought it to our table and describe the platter and told us that everything was edible. We ate it all and it was the freshest we have had in a long time.  Lovely.  We also shared the gyoza dumplings which were good.  

My meal was the black cod, melt in your mouth emigrant fish paired with a recommended red wine from the waiter.  
Just delightful! Hubby filled up mainly on the sashimi so he had a Riz (rice) bowl with shrimp at the end.  

All in all a lovely meal in a great atmosphere and easy metro ride back to our AirBNB."}
{"text":"The beef was very good, but the portion was quite small and not very filling. The matcha flavour of the crêpes was too strong."}
{"text":"Not just a pretty face. The food at Jatoba was outstanding. These are the must-haves dishes in my opinion:

- eggplant dumplings
- brussel chips
- king oyster mushrooms and miso gratin
- spicy crispy tofu
- sauteed sweet and sour eggplant
- sesame steamed rice
- cheesecake 

Great place for vegetarians. Pricey but worth it. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience... Delicious food and great customer service!!!! I highly recommend this place, it worths every single penny!"}
{"text":"Le Jatoba est sans contredit, un des meilleurs restaurants en son genre à Montréal. Le décor est sublime et les plats sont délicieux. 

En fait, il n'y a rien à dire de négatif contre ce restaurant. Les assiettes sont idéales pour être partager avec vos amis et très variées ce qui permet de goûter à plusieurs choses différentes durant votre soirée. Les gyozas et le riz frit au canard confit sont des incontournables. 

Un excellent resto pour aller entre amis ou pour une petite soirée romantique avec une bonne bouteille de vin dans un décor magnifique sera une réussite sur toute la ligne."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Nice decor. Very expensive and poor service. 

The dishes were all fantastic. Favorites were the scallops, beef tataki and yellowtail but the portions are very small (you would need at least 2 entrees per person) and quite expensive. The ingredients were very fresh but definitely not the best Japanese I've ever had. 

They have limited options of wine by the glass and there are not enough employees in the dining room to accommodate their guests. My wine glass was empty most of the meal and we would have purchased at least one more, if not two more bottles had the waiter been on task with refilling glasses. 

I'd go if you're not in a hurry and budget is no issue. Otherwise, I'm sure there are better options."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jatoba pretty regularly for lunch over the summer. This restaurant has one of the nicest terraces in the downtown area. In fact the decor and atmosphere of the entire restaurant, both inside and out, is A+. Whether it is for a quick business lunch or to chill out on the terrace in the afternoon you can't go wrong here.

Everything on the menu is pretty solid and the presentation is great. If I had to pick out one standout main dish it would certainly be the cod. It is excellently prepared and melts in your mouth. However, the real highlights on their menu are the desserts. Oh my god each one that I have seen or tasted is amazing. The portions are enormous so plan to share and they are rich and just out of this world. Take the chocolate bomb for example, someone has posted a video of this. Yes, this menu item is so amazing and interactive it requires a video.  Upon arrival at your table the server will pour hot chocolate melting a chocolate sphere containing more chocolate and fruity goodness. Forget the main course just go straight for the dessert, you won't be disappointed. 

In all honesty, even if it wasn't for the desserts I would comeback just for the terrace, there is nowhere else downtown with such a nice outdoor space."}
{"text":"I've yet to write a yelp review for a restaurant within a couple of hours after eating there takeout.  Well here it is...

I ordered the Brussels Sprouts crisps and the King Oyster Mushrooms.  I've been eating Brussels Sprouts since I was a child and this is by far the best way I've ever had them prepared.  Crispy, savory, and seasoned perfectly, this is one of the best dishes I've experienced here in Canada.
 
The mushrooms were lightly seasoned and grilled perfectly.  They tasted delicious alone but they included a little cheese dip that took it to an unexpected level.

Every time I come to Montreal I will go to Jatoba.  Truly a gem."}
{"text":"There's nothing else like it downtown Montreal. The greatest food, drinks and ambiance."}
{"text":"Décor/ambiance : C'est très très très très beau! Les tables en bois, les lumières qui pendent, le bar en marbre, etc. Il y a de l'espace, c'est très aéré. Le décor vaut 5 étoiles. 

Menu: On est allé sur le diner et le menu était limité, mais très alléchant. On a pris de la morue, un tataki de thon et des dumplings. On était tous très satisfaits de nos plats. Mon thon était par contre mal tranché et il y avait beaucoup de filaments blancs. J'aurai assaisonné un peu plus le thon, mais il était pas mal. Ce sont de petites assiettes, mais assez pour un diner. Les gyozas sont parfaits avec un côté croustillant. L'offre de vins est assez variée. Ils ont aussi des cocktails et de la bière commerciale et importée. En dessert, on a pris un dessert au caramel et un autre au thé vert. Celui au caramel ressemblait à un s'mores, c'était succulent. Celui au thé vert était amer, avec une glace à la pamplemousse, nous avons quand même apprécié l'originalité de ce dessert, mais sans plus.   

Prix: Pour un diner, le prix est raisonnable, leur menu table d'hôte du midi varie entre 25-35$ environ. Avec la bouteille de vin et les desserts, ça l'a couté 200$ pour trois. C'est parfait pour le midi pour un diner d'affaires. Je ne sais pas si le soir, ils augmentent leur portion avec le prix, car c'est quand même des petites portions sur le midi. 

On a hâte d'essayer la terrasse l'été."}
{"text":"Exceptional food that is light and very balanced. Hands down the best gyoza and black cod that I've ever had and the service was excellent (there for lunch). I'll be dreaming of the food until I come back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Been twice to Jatoba, once with business guests and once with my partner, and the entire experience was impeccable: amazing seafood (enjoyed the shrimp dumplings and bio sucre salmon), drinks (the Shoreleave is great) and staff. Bonus: the restaurant is beautiful with great ambience."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Jatoba, I was glad to finally check it out. The menu is enormous and the ideia is to share so you get to taste many different options. I strongly suggest their cocktails. My friends and I each had a different one and all were amazing! Super creative and delicious. The food was very good, although in general I would say it was not extraordinary. For all the hype and being that pricy, I have to say I expected a little more. Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave great tips about what to order. But the only part of the meal I can call unforgettable was the dessert: a caramel tarte that was unbelievably good!"}
{"text":"If you like japanese food and suddenly feel fancy, this is the place for you. The food is fresh and the combination of the ingredients is nicely done. The best dishes i've had is the black cod and i've never had any other black cod like this elsewhere. It melts in your mouth as soon as you eat it and it has this nice subtile miso flavor. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful in choosing on what to order. The ambience is nice. The chef personally came to our table to explain the different kinds of fish on our sashimi platter. Althought it is quite pricey, every dish is definitely worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly and attentive and the room/ambiance are nice. The food is decent, not outstanding. Prices are somewhat inflated. 'Had the brussel sprout chips, crab dumplings, blue fin tataki (really nothing special there), duck bao (tasty, but Satay bros have better buns for a fraction of the price), the lobster (the one standout dish---lovely presentation and came with a tasty side of bok choy), and a caramel marshmallow dessert (it was good---Jatoba does good sweets). This was our second visit since the place opened, and we'll be back, but not soon. It's not the kind of place that leaves you dying for more of any particular dish and, for the price (around $400 for two people, including some drinks and sake), there are better dining experiences in town,  such as Joe Beef or Club Chasse et Pêche."}
{"text":"I come to Jatoba lots for lunch as its close to my workplace and has a great ambiance + food. I highly recommend the wok duck confit, the chirashi (basically a big bowl of sashimi!). Most recently I had one of their new items on their menu- the 5 spice chicken bao. The chicken was good but they haven't completely nailed the bao bun yet; it was thinner than it should be IMO!

Also keep it mind that the prices are pretty high for the portions you're getting! I brought my boyfriend here once and after 3 dishes he still needed a second dinner!

Overall, very good asian fusion with a beautiful interior."}
{"text":"Food was good so does the restaurant atmosphere.
People are looking for fusion fine cuisine can have it try. 

Dessert we ordered mille crepes, a bit disappointed. For the price of dessert, i expected something more delicate than what i tasted.

Overall experience i rated 4 out of 5, will visit again probably in summer for the beautiful terrace area."}
{"text":"I still can't believe where I was yesterday night. I think I was in Montreal, I think so... 

The second after the portal sucked me out of extremely cold mtl streets and into this L.A like wet dream of a resto, I froze. I excitedly began talking over the hostess who barely had time to finish greeting me: \"Where the hell am I? Are you guys joking? This is possibly the most important resto in MTL!'' and I hadn't even been close to knowing the menu or eating the food.

When I ask myself what kind of cuisine I love the most, Japanese and South American always come up and jab at my soft spot... Jatoba confirms this.

So how was the food you ask? On very few occasions, I like to use the words: Existentially Puzzling"}
{"text":"Elevated form of Japanese cuisine. Didn't have any of the gimmicks you usually find with fusion foods but gravitated towards a more elegant and contemporary taste that reflected all the traditional Japanese ingredients. 

Beef tataki and ox-tail dumplings are must haves."}
{"text":"I absolutely needed to write a review about this restaurant as it was, by far, one of the best Japanese restaurants in Montreal. My standards for Japanese food elevated in the past month as I just came back from Japan. The taste, texture, and presentation really took me back Kyoto where I ate the best sashimi.

The decor had a modern elegant flow to it, from the hardwood floors, the mouldings on the walls, to the light fixtures, and out to the terrace. And that terrace!!! B-E-A-utiful. Be sure to make reservation to get a spot outside. 

The service was on point, nothing bad to say. We were seated quickly, our waiter took our orders as soon as we put down the menus and filled water glasses as they reached near the end. 

The price can add up very quickly but it's really worth every hard earned dollars.

I highly recommend for a special night out. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Asian cuisine: Had the black cod with vegetables and rice dish, was very flavourful and cooked right. Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"This place has everything right. The decor is breathtaking & the food is incredible. We had great service and really enjoyed our dinner. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"It's a very fancy japanese restaurant. Expect to have to walk out of there with a bill of at least 50$ if you want to be full. At lunch, they have lunch \"specials\". Their sashimi platter is actually pretty decent ($$$).  For dinner, I tried many of their dishes and they are all on point (black cod,   scallops, etc.). Their cocktails are good."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this experience. Probably the worst \"high-end restaurant\" I've been to. 

The fish and meat were great. We had bluefin tataki, salmon tartare, filet mignon and sea bass; they were all fresh and delicious. However, the Alaskan crab was a too salty for my taste and the tempura shrimp had too much batter. We also had many types of dumplings, the only memorable one being the Hao Gao. You can find tastier dumplings for half the price in Chinatown though. The salads were okay, nothing to write home about. The vegetable sides often lacked seasoning and were bland. 
I had the Japanese cheesecake for dessert, which you should avoid. The cheesecake was dry and crumbly, nothing like the Japanese style. The accompanying wasabi ice cream was very out of place (and frankly, the taste was just off). Having pieces of maple toffee was nice though. Not sure how they fit in the plate, but at least they were good. 
Now you may be reading this and thinking, \"Wow, isn't she picky!\". But I think that when you're paying so much per plate (and keep in mind that the portions were tapa-sized), quality needs to follow suit. 

Now the service. For starters, our waiter left abruptly in the middle of taking our table's order, without excusing himself or anything. He did come back 5 minutes later, but this would be a preface to the overall rudeness of the service. Someone came over to take away our wine glasses without even asking us if we'd like anything to drink. Our plates were later taken away from the table even though they were clearly unfinished. Moreover, it was a rainy evening, and we were sitting in the veranda area; water was leaking through the roof and splashing on one end of the table, also bothering my friend in the process. The waiter came by, looked up to the ceiling with annoyance, and did absolutely *nothing*. No offer to move the table out of the dribbling water, and not even an apology. Seriously? We had to scoot over ourselves. 

Fix your roof, Jatoba."}
{"text":"Bar only after 22.00. The listing here is broken and very disappointing if you expect to EAT during the listed hours."}
{"text":"Jatoba is a beautiful restaurant with a really trendy and grand interiors. I've met Chef Olivier Vigneault when I used to work for an upscale sushi restaurant Kaizen, where I remembered how fantastic his cooking was. When I saw he's at Jatoba, I was sold.

Good: We've ordered the vegetarian gyoza (dumplings), the daikon with fresh herbs and spicy beef salad, and the 1855 beef tataki to share. The service was fantastic, and the food had totally exceeded my expectations. The complex flavours of each dish was simply amazing. I highly recommend the daikon salad, it's really light, filling and flavourful. You know the food is great when you can't decide which dish was your favourite because everything was so tasty.  Now, I had recently returned from a trip in Japan, so my expectations have been lowered for all Japanese restaurants in Canada (sorry), but having tried the sashimi at Jatoba, I was instantly reliving my Japan trip all over again. Each bite was so fresh with delicate flavours, you would slowly savour it. That's how good it was.

Bad: We didn't get a seat the terrace, but it was our fault we didn't reserve in advance.

Bottom line: This is among my top 5 picks in Montreal. I would recommend this place for anyone in a heart beat. If you still need more convincing to try this place, just look at Chef Olivier Vigneault's Instagram account."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have so much to say. First of all, the restaurant itself is gorgeous beyond words, the decoration and the overall atmosphere is very sophisticated and elegant. When it comes to the food, honestly beautiful presentation and elevated dishes. The king crab dumplings were amazing, however, I would say that considering the amount me and my friend had ordered, I was expecting to be full, but I was actually pleasantly surprised to feel pretty light and just the right amount of full. The red velvet dessert was jaw-dropping. 
The service was also extremely lovely and overall very caring to our needs. I would say though, that the table that we were placed in was uncomfortably close to the table next to us, so much so I could hear their conversation with utter clarity. 
Overall though, this is a spectacular restaurant."}
{"text":"Points positifs:
- Belle déco/ambiance: beaucoup de matériaux bruts comme le marbre , le bois,  le cuir, les métaux en plus de plusieurs plantes qui ornent le resto! Et on peut facilement s'entendre! Très agréable pour les yeux!!
- Emplacement très agréable et pratique au centre-ville
- Très bon service: serveurs attentionnés et souriants!

Points négatifs:
- Les plats que nous avons commandés ( chips de choux de bruxelles, dumplings végé, salade de papaye avec crevettes de roche, crabe a carapace molle 5 épices, thon bluefin , cocktails) n'ont pas été des coups de foudre pour nous. La qualité des ingrédients était impeccable mais les agencements faits dans les plats n'ont pas été mémorables. 
- La facture salée de la fin!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was delicious! And the presentation was pretty! We had: beef tataki, duck confit fried rice and shrimp dim sum (hagao). I was sceptical about the duck fried rice at the beginning (my friend wanted to order that so we went ahead), but wow, I was so impressed with it. The fried rice was so tasty! The beef tataki really melted in my mouth (my favourite of the night)! The combination of cider vinegar, sesame oil and sonomono sauce was amazing! Everything was light but so delicious.

I really enjoyed the ambiance too - it's trendy and somewhat fancy. I think it's a great place for a date or a small gathering. My waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the foods (I asked her quite a few questions). 

I will definitely be back to try more stuff on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh mazing. . Had eggplant dumpling. . I thought it may be an opportunity wasted as it was the veggie option,  but was suggested by the server .. don't regret it at all! Sooo good.  Had the lobster for dinner   another risk as its deep fried, also suggested. I thought it may be a way to ruin lobster. . First time I've had it deep fried.  But it was hardly battered. Super fresh and not greasy at all.  PS I got here by asking for recommendations. . Out of 30 ppl, 29 had this on their list ."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go to Jatoba because we'd read some concerning reviews about the service. We took a chance and went anyways and boy am I happy we did. The service was great. Kudos to the owners for reading the Yelp reviews and taking action!  The food was awesome. Great Asian fusion menu done family style. And the decor is great too."}
{"text":"From the warm decor, to friendly service, to the incredible food & drinks, this place is one of the best new spots in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The place is well hidden despite the fact that it is located in Place Philips downtown. We had the pork collar & the chirashi. The meat was so tender and tasteful! Since the terrace is covered, we can enjoy its ambiance whether is raining or not. I would recommend this place for 5à7 or big events."}
{"text":"Dined here on July 28. Overall, it was lovely and definitely would return! 

Food: 
Note that most of the items are very small. If you like to eat and have a hearty appetite like my husband and I do, be prepared to buy many different things. We got the GaI Gao dumplings ($16) to start which were very good. You only get 5, but if you are a party of two, they offer to give you a 6th which is great. However, we didn't know until we got the bill that they charge you $4 for the extra dumpling! I thought that was pricey. We then got Yaki Tori chicken ($24) - again, extremely tiny portions, only 4 small skewers which we ate in a heartbeat. Along with that, the steamed rice and vegetables with chopped pork were very good, both sizes were reasonable for two. After all of this, we were relatively full but had room for dessert. YOU MUST GET the dish with the marshmallow and ?blondie with ice cream. It's seriously one of the best desserts I have ever had !!!  What a great way to end the meal. 

Drinks: got two rounds of Aloha Jatobas. Very tasty and beautifully presented. However, the first round didn't taste like it had much booze in it which was a downer. The second round did, which made me question if there was any alcohol in the first drink at all. I wanted to get a third round because it was so refreshing, but at $14 a pop, it was getting expensive! 

Atmosphere: kinda has a retro vibe with plants and geometric figures on shelving. Very cozy and comfortable. We has hopes of sitting on the terrace but we were seated inside so I can't speak to the outside. 

Service: very good, attentive, sweet. 

TL;DR: pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Came here after some research into some great restaurants in Montreal and Jatoba did not disappoint! A great style of Japanese food with a North American flare!

The restaurant is located on a quite street just minutes away from Old Montreal. It look a bit of looking since the restaurant is slight hidden. The incredible decor reminds you of dining in someone's backyard. The slight upscale feel and the dim lighting sets the mood for the dining experience ahead.

Their five spice old fashion is really something else, a mix of bourbon and five spice mix gives the cocktail a unique flavor. The kumquat balances out the anise flavor to create a delicious mix.

The must have is the kampachi, a great blend of fresh kampachi fish with the spicy flavours of wasabi and jalapenos. A must try at the restaurant, my only complaint is the fact there wasn't more of it!

I'd definiately come back for sure next   time i'm in town!"}
{"text":"Jatoba is a new restaurant (6 months old). I came here tonight for a work dinner thinking it would likely be decent but it proved to be much more than that. All of my dinner companions agreed that had we been staying in Montreal an additional night we'd all come back again tomorrow for dinner just to try more menu items.  It was phenomenal! 
We shared dumplings as appetizers - the shrimp were good, the crab/avocado, outstanding. I had the black cod as my main course choosing that based on yelp reviews/photos. It was a standout meal! The cod was perfectly cooked and broke apart in huge, perfectly uniform flakes. It sat on a delicious veg puree with onion, zucchini, and some other green vegetable. We had a lovely chablis with our meal and stuck with that all evening. Because the meal was excellent we shared a few desserts. I can't recall every one of them but they were all excellent. One was the green tea maki and it was like a sponge cake had been soaked in green tea and then rolled around fresh berries and served with a side of tart sorbet. Perfect ending to a meal!  The service was good as well and the manager even came by to ask us if we were satisfied. The answer was a resounding \"Yes\". We sat inside but I noticed that they had a huge patio which I would opt for next time. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have discovered this place. We were seated in the beautiful covered terrasse. The ambiance was perfect - lights just right, music at ideal volume, plants & furniture were classy and comfortable. It's the kind of place you want to just linger and enjoy your meal. Which is exactly what we did! We had the 
group menu for $65 and the courses kept coming and coming. The first course was my favorite but they all had some outstanding dishes. The spicy salmon tartare and beef tataki were excellent, as was Jatoba's black cod. Would i try wasabe ice cream again? Probably not, but pairing it with the cheesecake was an interesting experience. I also enjoyed my Spicy Foo Pimm's Cup cocktail. The service was also first rate. An entirely charming experience!"}
{"text":"A very good choice for dinner. Hip decor, good vibe, nice service.  The Jatoba salad was awesome!  The ox ravioli was unique and very tasty. The mushroom side dish was amazing! Finally the sea bass and the short ribs (with lots of delicious veggies) were both very nicely prepared. If you are in central Montreal, worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here this week for lunch. The cod was divine! Flaky but not dry and had a very tasty and subtle taste. The bok choy was sautéed and cooked to perfection. Great ambience. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you want a hot restaurant experience with cool people then I highly recommend Jatoba.
You will dine in a newly decorated contemporary and spacious room. The place is buzzing with well healed 
MTL foodies and young professionals. So hats off to the owners because they definitely got the crowd in this difficult restaurant town. (Probably more restaurants per capita than anyplace on the planet).
Its the combination of location,eclectically good Asian inspired food and great space thats\" bringing them in\".
As for the menu its a sharing concept and we shared:
Apps of sautéed oyster mushrooms in a foamy cheese sauce, asparagus vinaigrette and gyosas; all were nicely plated but did not excel which is what you 
want in a place as nice as this.
The mains of Sautéed scallops, miso roasted octopus
 And a sushi roll were also well plated and for the most part good  except the octopus was  an overcooked misfire and the sushi roll was quite pedestrian. We had a side of duck fried rice which was super good.
This may sound like a of food for a table of four but the portions are fair but a bit petite.  So there was abdominal space left for desserts which just happened to be the highlight of the evening. A chocolate bombe
that  was the bomb;and a rendition of the ever popular red velvet cake which was more like a heavenly mousse than a gateaux. Bottom line: it looked and tasted sensational..ly. Hats off to the pastry chef.
Jatoba has a very extensive and pricey wine list from which we chose an excellent Oregon Pinot Noir(hard to find in Montreal where there is  a huge but understandable bias toward French wines. I would have  liked to see more bottles in the $40-60 range because the next steps up appeared @ $80 -$100 and way more$$$.
All in Jatoba is doing  most things right and its a great place for a fun , festive and may I add pricey
dinner.
5 stars are waiting if they kick they food up a notch or two."}
{"text":"FIRST, book a reservation. I went on Monday night with a party of 3. Thought the restaurant wont be busy. I was wrong. Had to sit in the nice courtyard. Service was attentative. 
Ordered scallops, salmon and dumplings. Really exquisite dishes. Small portion. asian fusion With emphasis on taste and presentation. Impeccable."}
{"text":"First of all, everything we had was un-effing-believable. Top 5 restaurant I've had in my life and I would travel to Montreal again to specifically eat at this restaurant each night. It ain't cheap but I would spend a G here without a care.

Top item that would make me spend a $500 plane ticket to travel back to Montreal...the fried vegetarian dumplings. Most unbelievable flavor combo in a vegetarian thing I've ever had. 5 others at my table agreed. We bought another without hesitation!

Service=impeccable. Shannon and her staff felt like they were only serving us while still being attentive to other patrons. Every recommendation Shannon made was on point! Girls knows her taste.

This should be a Viral review on every website. I don't usually yelp review but when I do I make sure it's for bad ass restaurants like Jatoba!"}
{"text":"Can I just say best service ever? Went there on Friday night with my family and everything was delicious. They loved the calamari (reminds you of popcorn shrimp), the filet minion (sliced thin when served with amazing sauce), beef tenderloin, Jatoba salad, dumplings, and to end the evening the chocolate bomb!!! We actually ordered two of them to watch the perfectly closed chocolate bomb melt from the hot chocolate sauce and open to show the inside of the dessert. It was gorgeous!! I am vegan and they accommodated me very well.

We will be back! Service extraordinaire."}
{"text":"My foodie group and I had the chance to dine at this establishment located in downtown Montreal on a Friday night and of course, we had reservations on the terrace. It was a dark day and raining hard when we arrived so we were so relieved when we noticed that the terrace is actually covered! The venue is very modern with exposed brick, dark wood tables, a slick bar and chandeliers, but the hanging lights and lots of greenery on the terrace really gave you the feel of the outdoors. The rooftop is actually clear and with all the windows, you'd get all the natural light in if it were a sunny evening; for sure, one of the most gorgeous terraces in Montreal!

We shared the tasting menu at 65$ per person and wow, was it well worth it! Four generous courses were served that left us full and content. Some dishes missed the mark like the sweet and sour chicken and the veal, mostly cause they were too dry and tasted more like smoke than anything else. The mango papaya salad and black cod dish were fabulous though, as were the cocktails. I had a spicy pimm's cocktail with wasabi and lemongrass which had the right combo of heat and sweet. Worth mentioning was the cheesecake dessert which came with a wasabi ice cream; the combo was good but not my thing although that cheesecake was fluffy heaven! 

The service was excellent as the staff was both personable and friendly, although there was a small wait between the second and third service. 

I'd totally return to the terrace on a sunny day to try some dishes from their a la carte menu and enjoy some of the lovely selections from the wine list; it was a memorable evening overall!"}
{"text":"In short,  I would say this restaurant is highly overpriced.  The portions are quite small and the recipes are nothing special.

We ordered the sashimi plate, rice with grilled shrimp and a gyoza vegetable.  The sashimi was good but the gyoza vegetable was chewy and fibrous.  Not worth $14! The rice was a very simple, unimpressive dish that was definitely not worth $18.

The service was mediocre at best. After the meal, our waiter disappeared. It took another wauter 20 minutes  to ask if we wanted a dessert. No one from the staff asked how our experience was.

Save yourself the expense and the disappointment and avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The covered terrace behind is absolutely gorgeous! However, it started raining strongly and it was so noisy! It was a very strong and unusual storm but i'm guessing even small rain might be bothersome.  
The food is a combination of japanese and fancy. Always very fresh and tasty. I love the dumplings and the bluefin tartare in crispy rolls were the perfect mix of creamy and crispy. 

My friend took the quail and it was a modest, small plate but so packed with flavor!. 
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is not only a beautifully-designed space, the food is creative, high quality, and super delicious. Do yourself a favor and ignore the caloric content of the caramel blondie homemade marshmallow dessert-- you will be thinking about it for days afterward. Jatoba is a Montreal must and the head chef is destined for greatness (he's also a very generous and lovely host)."}
{"text":"The place is not worth it.  The space is beautiful. Very well put together. 
However...
The food is sub par
The service is just ok
Never even a look over from the manger much less a visit. 
I've only spent a few days in Montreal, but Jatoba has left a bad taste in my mouth. 
Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible food. Food took 45 min after our appetizers . Came cold and over cooked and over salted . And by the end of it they still charged me for some of the orders"}
{"text":"Modern asian fusion Cuisine that is so friendly to our taste buds. So far this is our number one on the list of restaurants in our 11 nights here in Montreal. Super delicate yellow tail blends into the exotic flavor of clear soya. Cod was so delicious that I can't stop saying hmmmm. Will definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I came here with a friend for a catch up lunch so my comments only apply for the lunch service. 

The pros: Very nice setting for a business lunch if you work in the area. 
They have both indoor and a shaded outdoor setting options. 
Good option if you are looking for a healthy meal as more than half the menu boasts fresh fish in some variation. 

The cons: Service a bit on the slower side of you are in a hurry. It took almost 30 minutes between our salad and main course. This can be an issue if you have a restricted lunch timeframe. 
The food was very decent, good quality produce; definitely no complaints there. However it's rather on the pricier side. 36$ for 12 pieces of sashimi with some rather plain veggies is a bit on an overkill in my books. For the same price you could have gotten the sashimi omakase at Park sushi, which comes with 3 different serving sauces and a more generous portion of sashimi. Granted the location in core downtown comes with a price hike but price ratio still doesn't balance well once that factored in. 

If you can expense a 100$+ lunch meal on company tab than by all means this is a good place to get good quality food and impress a client. If it's just to catch up with a friend, I'd pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"No doubt, this is a beautiful spot... but I'd only go back for drinks. All show and no-go when it comes to food; everything is very average and overpriced. I typically have no problem spending a lot on food, but only if it's guaranteed to be delicious. I find a lot of these trending hotspots like Kampai and Jatoba are absolutely stunning, but the food is sub-par. It's more about the \"scene\" and not so much the culinary integrity."}
{"text":"My first love... no one ever forgets their first love! December 2015 was the first time I stepped foot at Jatoba; ever since, I've been back countless times (but to my lack of initiative, never took the time to review it). So... truth is, Jatoba is an extraordinary blend of culture, food, hand-crafted drinks, ambiance, and art. Chef Olivier Vigneault & his team present a truly unique Asian fusion concept (with a Montreal flair of course) whereby the freshness of each ingredient (especially the sashimi) hits your palate at about 120 km/hr. Whenever I have a guest visiting from out of town, this is my restaurant of choice. A truly experiential dining adventure worth the trek, but be sure to make a reservation. Genuine gratefulness to the Jatoba team for the hospitality, and we'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot based on so many positive reviews. Went here for a special occasion dinner, which my husband had mentioned while making the reservation. We showed up on time and the hostess showed us to our table. Nobody came to our table with even water. After 10 minutes, we asked for a server and menu. The entire time we were there, we were struggling to get our server's attention. It turned out he was a bartender, which explained why he wasn't very happy serving us. After 30 minutes, he finally took our order. We got our drinks in 15 minutes and first round of food in another 20 minutes. Then we had to wait for another 30 minutes to get our remaining order. The food was good. Drinks were good as well. Don't know what was up with so much wait because they were not busy. At this point I was getting restless and just wanted to finish eating and leave. It was quite late for a weeknight dinner. Finally finished eating and waited to ask for the bill. 15 minutes later, we managed to a get a server's attention and requested the bill. Got the bill in few minutes this time, paid and left. I had three restaurant options for that night but I decided to check this place out, which I believe was a mistake. It actually took us more than 2 hours here. Despite of mentioning that we were celebrating a special occasion, the service was horrible. Also, there was no apology whatsoever. I would like to check out their Terrasse  for drinks only but would not go here for food again because of the long wait."}
{"text":"Dinner menu: Minuscule portions that are good, not great. The lemongrass soup was delicious. The Sea Bass was good and a fair portion. Gai Gao dumplings which were ok, nothing special, and Hamachi which was portioned SMALLER than the palm of my hand, and good but not amazing. I saw decent portioned plates but ours were not. Presentation was beautiful. The ambience is pretty. Sound level loud. Tables very deep, creating a large distance between you and dinner partner - we had to speak in raised voices, adding to the loud din. 
Beautiful people. The saviour of the meal was the dessert. Caramel Dream was out of this world. I would return to sit at bar and have dessert only."}
{"text":"Sans hésiter l'un des meilleurs restaurants à Montréal ! 

C'est simple : tout est délicieux. Chaque plat est parfaitement travaillé et fait d'aliments de qualité et c'est du bonheur en bouche ! J'ai adoré le cabillaud et le filet mignon que je recommande tout particulièrement. 

En plus de la nourriture qui est exquise, le cadre est superbe (notamment le patio) et le service est de qualité. Seul petit bémol, les prix sont assez élevés (comptez $30 à $70 pour un plat) mais c'est tout à fait normal pour un service aussi superbe."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality of food... Maybe just this time but it was my first time so I'm just giving a review based on what I ate... The service and ambiance were great. Not the food.

I had the most expensive HaGao in my life and also the worst. Very little shrimp in it and the outer layer is way too thick. Doesn't taste  fresh at all. The sashimi bowl I order was expensive as well and not as fresh as I thought it would be. The fish is cut very thinly which is fine but they don't have the sashimi taste. The \"marinated\" vegetables that come with the sashimi was just shredded carrots and reddish.. I had way better sashimi bowl for a better price."}
{"text":"Cet endroit à tous les atouts pour un rendez-vous en tête à tête ou pour une sortie entre filles afin de se gâter un peu. Le décor est charmant, il y a de la verdure ici et là, durant la soirée les lumières sont tamisées pour une ambiance feutrée et plus intime. Je suppose que durant la journée l'ambiance doit être tout autre et la terrasse intérieure doit valoir le detour. Côté service, nous sommes accueillis rapidement par l'hôtesse qui prend nos manteaux, les range et nous indique notre table. Nous sommes rapidement servi par une dame qui nous explique le concept du restaurant. N'étant jamais venu, c'est vraiment l'idéal car on nous explique que les plats sont à partager. Cela signifie donc que les portions sont plus petites. On présume qu'en pregnant une entrée et un plat chacun nous serons rassasiés. Nous débutons avec les dumplings ultra avec crevettes et crabe. L'assiette se compose de 5 dumplings dans une sauce soya légère. A vue d'oeil le plat semble bon, les dumplings se décomposent facilement au contact des baguettes. Personnellement, le goût ne m'a pas impressionné. C'était raisonnablement bon, mais sans plus. Pour le prix soit 19$ pour les 5 morceaux je m'attendais a nettement mieux. Puis, nous avons continué avec le tataki de boeuf et le tartare de saumon épicé. Mon ami avait l'air dépité devant son assiette de tataki, la portion avait l'air si petite, de quoi vous laisser sur votre faim et légèrement insatisfait sachant que le plat est à 21$. Mon tartare de saumon quant à lui ne fut pas une décéption. J'adore quand le saumon est relevé et il l'était largement dans ce cas ci. Sur le dessus du tartare était disposé des jalapenos marinés, de la purée d'avocat (non mais quelle idée géniale de mettre de l'avocat yummy!!) et des flocons de tempura. Il s'agissait d'une portion de 200g assez pour une personne et à un prix raisonnable de 23$. Donc en gros j'ai vécu une expérience assez agréable, je recommanderais l'endroit mais en avisant que les prix sont trop élevés à mon avis et donc le rapport qualité prix est inadéquat. Je ne pense pas que leurs plats méritent un tel coût. Je n'ai même pas pu terminer avec un dessert (scandale à mon avis!) comme ils étaient tous à 16 ou 18$ ce que je juge totalement déraisonnable."}
{"text":"First night in Montreal with my wife and if this is the standard of eateries it should be an epic few days.  Buzzing with fast moving servers and bright eyed guests the reviews of previous Yelpers lived up to the reality.  Delicate sushi with inspired cocktails to wash them down had us tapping our feet with happiness.  The citrus soup with red curry avoided the overpowering side of the spice while delivering a good chili kick. The oxtail dumplings wth green apple and jalapeño were wonderful and the swordfish seared with a homemade Yuzu and mango shavings took a different slant from the usual approach.  In the end we were too full to take on the ultra rare beef tatake with truffles.....but we've decided to go back tonight and have it as a bar appetizer instead!"}
{"text":"It is been a while I have a very very pleasant experience at a restaurant. The ambiance was very well designed from the lighting to the the music and decor. It has a trendy modern feel to it. The waiter was on point, he almost knew what we want before we order. Gave us advice on what to pick and his choices didn't disappoint. We had the shrimp dumpling, they were pretty good, the spicy salmon tartare was really really good, i am not too sure about the avocado cream they put on it but it wasn't overwhelming, I could almost avoid it. The egg plans were amazing, the coconut shrimp  was a bit bland, though the shrimp was well done. 
The caramel dessert they have was to the best way to end the dinner. 
This place is perfect for business, romantic or casual dinner with friends"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible, we had to send our food back three times last because it was cold. To the people who say this was a good Restaurant, you have no right to be posting on yelp. Complete shit restaurant, and I've eaten them all."}
{"text":"I usually do not leave comments but I am so hungry after dining here after $ 159 bill for two person, but I do not feel like ordering more because the bill will go higher. They do have a good environment tho. Just do not go there if you are hungry. Enough said, running home for instant noodle=D"}
{"text":"Desapointing experiance, if your going to try to compete in the iskaya business your ramen has to be good so does your sushi and none of the 2 were good, also it was pricy and small portions we were still hungry after 3 rolls, a ramen et fried chicken."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy. Had been meaning to try this resto since it opened. Everything on the menu is really well thought out. The black cod was the best I have ever had. Period. It just melted in my mouth. And even just simple edamame was done right; seasoning was on point, although it might be considered spicy for certain palates.   
Def worth a try."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the drinks. Don't know who was the mastermind behind the drinks but good job!!! I took 2 drinks, both delish and with a nice amount of alcohol! Now for the food, loved the dumplings and tartare. Salad was ok and served with eel which I didn't see on the menu. Sashimi was excellent. Great option for a celebration or if u have a good amount of money to spend!!!  enjoy!"}
{"text":"When one talks about dining in Montreal, we rarely talk about the downtown core as a big part of that. There are definitely places worth checking out that are more than simply overpriced fare for the business crowd. One of these is Jatoba. Located in Phillips Square, Jatoba is a project headed by chef Olivier Vigneault, previously a sous-chef for Antonio Park.

The space, conceived by La Chambre Design, is a beautiful combination of the old brownstone structure with some more modern touches. I love how they incorporate the brick facades all around the different rooms and make them focal points. The lighting is ample but slightly dimmed to create a nice intimate feel. Lots of wood warms up the space and the kitchen is exposed in the big backroom. The other big element is the use of tons of plant life to incorporate some nature into the space. The whole of the restaurant feels very warm and cozy.

Jatoba has a pretty good cocktail menu and wine list. I started with a Lavender May - Lot 40, lavender and calico syrup, fresh lime juice, egg white, rhubarb bitters. I love egg white cocktails so this was an easy sell for me. Not too floral with a nice touch of both sweet and sour. The frothy texture of the egg white added some body to it as well. As for the wine, for the purpose of full disclosure, I know the sommelier of Jatoba - an old high school friend - so with his advice, we were treated to a lovely French Patrimonio that we had never heard of. Just the fact he got my parents to like a French wine is worth very high praise. Thanks Marc-Andre!

Food-wise, given the pedigree of the chef, you can imagine that the menu is Asian-inspired fusion fare. As a group of 5, we were able to share numerous items. First up, I can never say no to a bowl of edamame with yusuf powder, nanami togarashi and fleur de sel. Always love that salty kick.

We also tried the Brussel sprout chips with spices. Very thinly sliced and fried up, I personally loved the slightly bitter notes from the sprouts and the crunch that came from frying them.

Next up, we went for some dumplings. We tried three varieties - the Gyoza (pork, shrimp, chinese chives, spicy samba oelek soy and chinese vinegar), the Tori (chicken, napa cabbage, braised shiitakes, leek and sonomono sauce) and the Ha Gao (shrimp, green onion and red wine tobiko). All excellent - very flavourful with the subtle hints of the extra ingredients above the primary proteins. Kind of made me crave some true Dim Sum at that point....

My girlfriend and I felt like a soup so we shared the lemongrass soup - lemongrass and coconut cream, shrimp, lobster, tomatoes, thai basil, green onions and bamboo. A lovely well balanced soup. The lemongrass was strong but the sweetness of the coconut cream softened it slightly and created a super silky texture. The addition of shrimp and lobster gave it some more heft and the tomatoes brought some freshness and tanginess. One of the best soups I've had in a while.

As a rice dish, we went with the fried rice with duck confit which included an egg, vegetable medley, yukon gold chips, green onions, micro coriander and enoki mushrooms. Very generous portion of rice and lovely flavours all around. The rice had the crunch of a fried rice with some earthy notes. The addition of the duck confit provided a nice rich and fatty contrast to the rest of the rice dish.

Next up was sushi time. We went with The Roll - atlantic salmon, spicy hamachi, avocado, cucumber, tempura flakes, sweet soy and yusuf yogourt. A more upscale version of a classic \"Kamikaze\" roll and excellent all around. Key differentiation was the use of less of the binding elements like the tempura and more emphasis of the freshness of the salmon. The fish was beautiful and came through clearly within the roll. No hiding of the fish here. The tempura brought a touch of crunch and I liked the touch of sweet creaminess coming from the yogourt.

The final savoury dish we tried was the 1855 Beef Tataki seared with sesame oil, mini green beans with cider vinegar, dwarf truffle peaches, black quinoa soufflé and sonomono sauce. Beautiful elegant dish - the beef was sliced beautifully thin and super tender. The addition elements simply play to augment the natural flavours of the beef.

For dessert, we got the Chocolate Bomb and the Japanese cheesecake. The bomb - a combination of black and white triple chocolate brownie with hazelnut praline, dark chocolate and hazelnut truffle, dark chocolate mousse, marbled chocolate sphere and milk chocolate sauce - was a chocolate overload in all the best ways possible. I loved the different uses of texture and flavours within all the chocolate. The cheesecake served with maple spongy candy and black sesame ice cream was excellent texture-wise. Nice and creamy. The black sesame ice cream was not my thing but a cool pairing to the inherent richness and creaminess of the cake.

Jatoba was a lovely night out - wonderful drinks, awesome service and good food."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in the neighborhood. Jotoba is a high-end Japanese/Asian Fusion restaurant. The fish was impeccable and they have a decent selection of sakes. Many items on the menu worth exploring. I will definitely be back. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"I should have given it a 4.5 star because it is almost as good as it could get for Asian fusion cuisine in Montreal, not to mention the amazing decor and beautiful terrace (perfect for fancy office party/networking event). The only reason i removed 1 star was probably due to the portion. My husband left a business lunch there hungry and didn't wanna go back until i insisted- then we were both pleasantly surprised at dinner: the Lobster dish comes with a complimentary shanghai bok choy and it reminds me of some top Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong (price was even higher). The gratin with king oyster mushroom is creative and tasty - a must-have! The other dishes like fried rice (only filling dish you could order), crispy tofu, salmon tartare are a bit less memorable but definitely still good. 
tips: do 2 plates per person+dessert or 3 plates/person if you have light items like salad/tofu.
It's pricy but totally worth it . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"J'y vais à l'occasion pour le lunch et le bento box est toujours différent et... intéressant.  L'ambiance est bonne et le restaurant pas trop bruyant.

J'ai tenté l'expérience au souper et je ne l'ai pas regretté.  Le menu est légèrment plus évolué le soir.  Le seul bémol est qu'il est facile de s'emporter et on se met à commander une multitude de plats.  Ça peut s'avérer douloureux pour le portefeuille."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, beautiful presentation of the food, great service, very good quality ingredients, not super authentic (not that it matters as long as the food is good), and very, very pricey. 

The menu is eclectic, more Asian fusion than actually Japanese. We had the sashimi platter daily special and the coconut rice with grilled shrimp. We had about three glasses of wine and a mixed drink between us, and we shared a dessert. All of this came to $202ish before gratuity. 

The sashimi was fresh and served with all kinds of interesting, pretty, and edible herbs/flowers/plants. It was exquisitely arranged on a bed of ice, very fresh and tasty. A good variety of fish I might not have otherwise chosen, because when I order à la carte I tend to stick to my usual faves. Interestingly, it was served with a sweet soy sauce as opposed to the type you'd normally get with sashimi/sushi. In fact, it tasted almost like Chinese clay pot rice (???) soy sauce, because it was sweetish. 

The coconut rice was delicious and fragrant but overcooked (or rather, cooked with too much liquid). My grandpa would probably rave about it. The shrimp was decent but probably brined in baking soda to make the meat springier - I'd prefer untreated shrimp. The rice was a little bland, to be honest. 

Drinks were good. 

The highlight was the dessert for sure. My dining companion told me they had an amazing dessert chef and he was right!!! I'm glad it was so good too, because the desserts were on average $18 each before tax and gratuity. We had this caramel concoction - two tender, fragrant, thin layers of warm cake with some warm caramel stuff in the middle, topped with The Best Vanilla Ice Cream I'd Ever Had. The ice cream was HEAVENLY. It was generously dotted with vanilla beans and the flavour was so pure and vanilla-y, just the right amount of sweetness, and the difference in temperature went so perfectly with the warm cake under it. We were told it's one of their bestsellers and I can see why - I will be fantasizing about it for a long time!"}

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful very elegant but our reservation was at the terrace ... which to our surprise it was covered  with clear roof and lots of green ... with beautiful globe shaped lamps .... it was perfect as it was a rainy day ... with summer being so short in Quebec .. we want to maximize our outside seating as much as we can...

Now food
We had the 65$ tasting menu ...  and boy we were not disappointed... it was lots of food!!!
Some dishes hit my palate some missed it ... but overall it was great .!!!
The cocktails were very interesting and very originals .. 
the service was very attentive and professional 
So given the money that we paid, the amount of food we got .. the originality of the dishes ...the amazing cocktails ... the excellent service .. the beauty of the terrace 
This place is a must ... to any and every foodie out there .!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big of Asian fusion but this restaurant exceeded my expectations. All the dishes we tried were jam packed with flavours that complemented each other. Service was excellent, staff members were very attentive and friendly. Highlights of the night: hamachi, king oysters, uni (so good)."}
{"text":"Very nice trendy restaurant. Nice decor especially in the back room where we sat. They have valet for $15. 
Water refills were decent. 
The food is Asian fusion . 
I tried a few appetizers: Eggplant, Mushrooms, Veggie dumplings, chicken dumplings. Mushrooms were the best. I would get that one again. 
For the main I got the sweet and sour chicken. It was incredible. I would get it again. Although I also wouldn't mind trying other things on the menu. 
My hubby got the cod. It was good but the chicken was better. 
Caramel cake was a good dessert."}
