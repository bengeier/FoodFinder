{"text":"There are far better Souvlaki Hut's in the area. The food was sloppy and was not made with care. Salad was soggy, the pita was soggy, the garlic bread was a wet hot dog bun, the honey sticks were stale, the rice was watery and tasteless. For the price you're paying take the five extra minutes and drive to the Souvlaki Hut at Winston Churchill it is worth it."}
{"text":"Do not order from here!  We have ordered multiple times every week for the past 6 months. Yes that sounds crazy but we are busy professionals living in the Beach and we love Greek food. Almost every time we order we are charged for items that are not delivered correctly. We call to notify the error and they tell us they will make the correction next time. Each subsequent order goes along with a description of past issues. They (owners) tell us they don't recall the conversation. Today was the last opportunity for them. Same thing happened again. Apologies were offered. Really for us it's not the fact we lose  money and essentially are overcharged for every order but there is a lack of accountability and they do not care!  Order from any other Greek delivery.   do not order here they will overcharge and most assuredly and under deliver !"}
{"text":"I live out of the way from this location. However, the owner is excellent, the food is great and the service is terrific so I always stop by for a meal....  For the past year...I've been going to this location once a week... have never had a bad experience. Especially when the owner is there, he's on the ball... he knows how to run a restaurant. (excellent service and communication with clients)  I mean if you want authentic greek food, go to the select few on the danforth, but for fast greek food... this place hits the spot for sure.  The potions are generous, the prices very reasonable... and the flavors are great.  Good job to the owner of this franchise. i've tried others, not a huge fan, but you maintain your business well and I will continue to head to your location for the quality of food and service.   Next stop is to try the new souvlaki hut that just opened in bloor west village!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would this place is garbage the food sucks the service is trash and rude, how hard is it to understand a fucking simple gyro order I'm never ever coming here again what a waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. A little small inside; it will accommodate something like 12 persons at any time. Staff is attentive. The small souvlaki gyro dinner isn't."}
{"text":"This place is a nice combination of fast food and a sit-down restaurant. The food is exactly what I was hoping for and for a place that has fast food tendencies (quickly prepared, inexpensive) it delivers better than several restaurants I've been to on the Danforth that have lacked flavour. This place is comfortable, affordable and completely delicious. The service is also excellent. You order and pay upfront but they bring the order to your table. They also use real plates and cutlery, no plastic or tinfoil here. The staff are also very friendly and seem to genuinely appreciate your business. The food is delicious and the portions are huge! As a bonus there is a large screen broadcasting CP24 in the back, which is great if you're grabbing lunch by yourself. Alternatively, you can sit at the front and people watch over a souvlaki.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service! Ordered for delivery and was told it would be delivered in 45 minutes. An hour later, I called to see what was going on and was told that it would be there soon. The delivery finally arrived 30 minutes later but freezing cold (thats an hour and a half later). I called the store back to complain that it was extremely late and came cold but was told that it was too busy for someone to talk to me and that the manager would call back in 15 minutes. Not surprisingly, nobody called me back and I was forced to call back 30 minutes later to see if I could speak to a manger and was told by a rude employee that it was still busy and that they could not speak to me then. Not giving up I tried for a third time to speak to the manager and finally spoke to a rude employee who claimed their name was Nadia who told me that it was rush hour and that's why the meal was so late. Needless to say, I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE!!"}
{"text":"Avoid the Bloor West location. Go to the Etobicoke one instead.  When they first opened, everything was great. I would usually go out of my way to Dundas West location in Etobicoke, until this location opened. After a few months, they changed owners. Ever since, I have given these guys so many \"breaks\" they have screwed up my order 100% of the time.   We call in our order, usually dinner for 4-6 people. Either they miss the pita bread, leave out a salad, forget one of the sides or give us brown/old salad. Its really disappointing, the last 2 orders were the last draw. Both times, called in the order, confirmed the order 3 times with them, said to come in 20 mins, we showed up in 25 mins and still had to wait another 20 mins for them to start the order. No only that, i confirm the order and they mixed up the meats and what sides went with that order.  These people do not know how to run a business. Its frustrating that you give a business so many chances and they just keep screwing up. It's the people running the place, disorganized and i doubt this place will last.  My advice, take the extra 10 mins drive and go to the location in Etobicoke. They have never, ever messed up my order in the 3+ years I've been going there."}
{"text":"Staff is great. Food is always fresh/hot and ready to go when I pre-call my order. They never screw up my order like the Bloor West location. Owner is friendly and knows how to run his business properly."}
{"text":"Best souvlaki in the beach!  Clean, fresh and quick.   Eat in or take out, one of the best places in the beach.  Family run and very friendly.  Good for kids and peanut free!"}
{"text":"$10 for 2 Gyros are delicious. Chicken dinner is also really nice. The restaurant is clean. The owner is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Had pork souvlaki dinner, came to around $11. Comes with pork souvlaki, choice of fries, greek fries (fries topped with olives and feta cheese), potatoes or rice & potatoes. Also comes with garlic bread, greek salad, and honey sticks (3 sticks of cut pita bread smothered and pan fried with fat and sugar and cinnamon).  THE GOOD: Their pork souvlaki is THE moistest. I didn't expect this from a chain. I rarely eat souvlaki, because they are usually decrepit, dry little pieces of cheap meat. I only decided to take a leap of faith because of the high yelp rating, and this was a pleasant surprise. Also, inside decor and ambiance is actually quite nice, I wouldn't mind eating in. Salad was good.  THE BAD: Complaints are that they gave me just pita bread instead of garlic bread...why? I saw them making garlic bread for other people who ordered pork souvlaki dinner plates, so WHY? Did you run out of bread?  Also, their potato is very very very salty. TOO salty. Will never pick that as a side order again.  NEXT TIME? : Yes, I will be back. They have fries as a side option, and I was like, why fries at a souvlaki place? Ew. But their fries looked amazing...thick cut and golden brown. Not puny, thin McDonald's fries. I will try this next time."}
{"text":"This Souvlaki place doesn't stand up to its promise, the chicken Souvlaki is not filling enough and over priced for its size. The service is alright and at times wait times for something fast are too long."}
{"text":"Had an amazing Gyros from here which tasted fresh and flavourful. The owner could have cracked a smile instead of looking depressed but outside of that I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to get takeout from here all the time and it was delicious. Lately it has been going downhill. The food has become bland and the tsatziki is not consistent - sometimes very good sometimes very bland. On top of that, when we called to order tonight, the lady on the phone was so quick to hang up that we had to call back and finish our order. When my boyfriend went to pick up the order and asked how many sauces were in the bag (we get two) she was very adamant that there were two. When we got home, we realized that a) there was only one sauce and b) our food was cold. Very disappointed and won't be going back there anymore."}
{"text":"They sometimes open for two hours of the day. It is run by children it seems, never have I seen such awful management in a restaurant.  This is the worst run business I have seen in Toronto, stay clear."}
{"text":"Love this place (and I'm Greek, so I  believe I have a pretty good grasp of Greek food). I've had the gyro and souvlaki dinners. For a quick fast-food style spot, it's excellent."}
{"text":"This place is bad bad not good. They ran out of rice, only telling us after we had waited 20 minutes. They give us fries as substitute, yet neglected to give us the rest of what the dinner included. Fries weren't even good. Slow service, long wait. Not great.  Also meat was over cooked. C'mon now  Go to Krazzy Gyro further west on Dundas. They had rice and were very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is good, flavourful and fresh. I usually order the small chicken souvlaki dinner or the chicken souvlaki on a pita combo, both are a great value with really generous portions. They also throw in an order of honey sticks, which is really the reason I keep coming back! I love the simple, sweet treat.  I usually order to go, but there is a decent eat-in area, especially considering this location used to be a Mr. Sub. The parking in front is limited, and the lot can be tricky to get in and out of since it is right on the corner of the intersection."}
{"text":"We ordered one Chicken Souvlaki Dinner Combo and one Gyros Combo. Combo come with salad, pop, and honey stick. When we got home, we noticed that salad, pops and honey sticks were missing. I called them and complained about this. They said \"only three people are working in this tiny store. You came here at busy time\". That's what she said. Even though it was busy time, how can you forget so many things? In the entire conversation over phone, she didn't apologize at all. First thing you have to do is to APOLOGIZE to a customer, isn't it? We were so tired today so we decided to pick up....Everything was disappointed. we will NEVER order food from here."}
{"text":"Food was good and prepared fresh. I had a craving for Greek and it satisfied it. Price was average."}
{"text":"Disappointing, and the quality has droppen off. There have been at least 3 different ownerships that I've ate at this location under. Previously, things had been great, and then quite decent. The recent is now at a point where things have fallen off, and is either at a point of not being able to survive, or simply not caring. There was once a sign up that used to say 'we apologize for the wait, as we make everything made to order' ... that sign is now gone. Instead, you get gyros meat re-heated from a warmer/slow cooker. However, today I was charged a different price than what was on the menu. I questioned it to the girl working there, who I realized was just a regular employee -- she seemed embarassed for her having to respond that the owner had changed the prices, but had not yet got the updated sign. In this case, should I not be charged what is on the board until it is updated? Knowing that she wasn't the reason for it, I just asked she relay the concern to their owner. Meat was ok. You could taste it being dried out, but I guess at this point, that shouldn't be a surprise going forward.  Edit: 4 months later. Some prices have been adjusted. Decided to get something that wasn't one of the most popular orders. Price? $1 more expensive on the till, vs what is on the menu. Is this even legal? Walked out, after seeing that. No reason to give business to an owner that doesn't care about his own store."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once but I've been meaning to go back ever since. The food was delicious and the service was great! I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and the bf had the gyros dinner. We will be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Nice warm pita with upfront salad.  Would have liked to receive the tzaziki upfront too. Nice ambiance with fireplace, quick service, friendly staff. Ordered chicken souvlaki. Loved the Honey Pita sticks for dessert. Will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, well priced and amazing service. I had the gyro sandwich, best I've had to date. The dinner platter even comes with Dessert!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb souvlaki dinner, that cost more than restaurant prices, just to try and was I disappointed  .. meat was tough and horrible, no taste of lamb nor flavour of marination.. tough to chew and very unpleasant to the eye.. even the tatziki sauce was god knows what .. gave it to my dog and he wouldn't eat it? Wow! What a waste of $$$"}
{"text":"Awful greek food. I'm a vegetarian so I can only speak for the rice, potatoes and salad. I figured since I didn't get meat that they would compensate with extra rice/potatoes.. the container was half full. Everything was extremely bland. The rice felt like it was minute rice cooked in the microwave. The salad needs cucumbers. The \"tzatziki\" literally tasted like sour cream. My bfs chicken was dry (and it's $5 for an extra skewer, way overpriced). They gave us one piece of bread for the two of us and 3 pieces of honey sticks... portioning a little off there. It's edible just not tasty. Very underwhelming overall, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. I always go back for the chicken souvlaki and gyros. The Greek fries are delish as well!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've ever been served. Ordered the lamb souvlaki on a Greek salad. Meat was tough and full of gristle. Super gross. Service was gruff. Expensive too! This place has little going for it."}
{"text":"Good consistent food, the guy who is always working there is super friendly and funny, unfortunately they raised their prices and are no longer as competitive to the rest of the choices in the area."}
{"text":"This place portion is huge!! I ordered the chicken small souvlaki dinner, my wife got the gyro small dinner. I have to say this is the best meat I had at a Greek restaurant. It was moist and juicy.  The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the salad was fresh. They also gave you a plate of pitas. Only downfall was the rice, It was undercooked or something and it was super hard. Other than that this place is pretty good. I will def come back next time to try the lamb which was sold out when I went."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I thought I was getting your average fast food pita. I was wrong. It was amazing. I eat pittas all the time and this was one of the best. I got it with extra tzatziki and hot sauce. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic alternative food option in the neighbourhood! This location was opened a few months ago and am happy to see it thriving.   The food is really tasty (especially any of the chicken dishes) and affordable.   Staff is super friendly and the owners are really nice. I haven't eaten at the restaurant yet so I'm reviewing based on my experiences for pick up and delivery."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very reasonable price. The small dinners are more than enough and I'm a big guy with a big appetite. I usually get the chicken or the pork souvlaki dinner."}
{"text":"I kid you not, this was one of the best fast-food Greek places I've ever been to.  The place opened recently, and it's actually quite nice inside, with a big TV at the back, and a fake fireplace. It's got a nice cozy feel for what seems like a fast-food joint.  Me and my partner went here for dinner the other night, and the food was friggen delicious! For under $10 a plate, we ordered the \"small\" chicken or pork soulvaki dinner, which came with salad (tonnes of feta!), rice (to die for), and potatoes (melted in your mouth). Both orders came with tsaziki on the side as well as warm grilled pita. I'm not sure how they make money at this rate. Incredible value. Both platters, along with a can of coke, came to $22. The guy even brought the dishes to our table for us, so we threw in an extra few bux for a tip.  I think this'll be my go-to quick meal option whenever I'm near Yonge and Dav."}
{"text":"PUBES! Do not eat here. I'm writing this review before my call to main office. I work by this restaurant and frequently visit, satisfied... With a side of PUBES.   It was clear to both me my coworkers and the waitress that the hair in my food was a PUBE. I asked her to come over to my table, and asked her what it looked like to her, a sure face of shame and guilt fell over her stare. She would not answer me.   This is atrocious...I intend to let the head office know. Hoping to stop her from working there at least but she runs the restaurant full time. Discusting."}
{"text":"Good size souvlaki. Great service. This is where I get off my bus and do my 10 minute walk to work 5 days a week.   Looks like a small joint from the outside but plenty of seating inside.  Friendly staff. Sandwich was awesome. Full review once I visit the place one more time."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Greek and the Food was good! Nice staff! They have a patio where you can eat outside. I had the souvlaki dinner ($14) not bad for an awesome taste. You can also have an option if you like garlic bread or pita."}
{"text":"For a franchise chain, I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to a few Greek restaurants in Greektown a few times and I also frequent Messini at Eglinton from time to time. In my opinion, Messini and Souvlaki Hut are hands down the best choices for Greek food in Toronto.   One problem I have with many sit down Greek restaurants is that they are severely overpriced. Souvlaki Hut is just a little more expensive than the food court variants like Mr Souvlaki but in exchange, the quality is amazing! Portions are good too. We had Chicken Souvlaki Dinner and a sandwich combo. Despite being modestly called \"small\", it looks pretty large to me. It came with tons of salads and feta cheese and lots of rice. I'd say it's at least 50% more than what I'd normally get from a fancy Greek restaurant on the Danforth. The sandwich combo comes with a pop and also with rice.   Quality wise, I find the greens in the salad to be fresh. The pita bread was nice and soft. The Tzitziki sauce (spelling?) is a bit lighter than other places and it suits my preference perfectly. The rice is not completely swimming in oil in some other places I've tried. Most importantly, the meat didn't taste like a load of msg. Often after eating greek food, I'd feel thirsty and tired due to the msg. But not at Souvlaki Hut.   Messini still has the best gyros wrap in my opinion but Souvlaki Hut's is significantly healthier. Messini's is cheaper and super delicious but it's a little greasy and they stuff it with fries. Messini's wrap is something worth getting fat for. Souvlaki Hut's wrap was ok. Delicious pork and fresh vegetables inside. Significantly less greasy than other places I've tried.   While it's a franchise, it sould not be confused with the food court variants. This location has tables at the back and a TV. We sat down and they even brought the food to our table. Heck they even gave me water. I feel like I should have paid tips. Of course, it doesn't have the same atmosphere as some of the restaurants in the Danforth but if you're primarily concerned about food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great Greek family oriented restaurant. Fresh ingredients and tasty food. It is an affordable option around the neighborhood. I tried the chicken souvlaki sandwich and dinner. Both were really good."}
{"text":"I had the small chicken souvlaki dinner, which came with Greek salad, garlic bread, tzatziki, rice, potatoes, and honey sticks. Needless to say, I did not go hungry that night and for $12 it was quite a bargain!   While I had to wait quite a while for my order to be ready, all of it was freshly prepared, except for the honey sticks, which I did not have any room for anyway. While I waited, I watched the news on their big screen tv. The chicken was juicy and tender and everything was scrumptious.  The establishment is very clean and service was amazing. For a chain restaurant, I'm impressed and would return again."}
{"text":"Tasteless with cheap portions/ also iceberg lettuce squeezed into a little container with no dressing on it. What ever not going back!!!"}
{"text":"Good Greek food despite the cooks aren't greek. I would know I'm Greek.    Anyways I had pork Souvlaki, meat was nice and tender.... the pita is what you expect. The cucumbers threw me off, not a typical topping and should have been chop up a bit  All and all a good meal"}
{"text":"This establishment is truly disappointing. For a place that has the words \"Fresh everyday\" written in bold all over the menu, I was to surprised to find out that not one of the 5 items that comprised my meal were anything but fresh.  The chicken was dry and the portion was laughable for how much it cost (~6.75 for a single skewer holding less than a 1/4lb of meat). The potatoes and rice were mushy and tasted old... I could not get myself to finish either despite them being 75% of the whole meal. The tzatziki was the icing on the cake though. It had no cucumber, dill, or whatever else is usually in it, rather it was just condensed yogurt. The price for the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner was 12.95 + tax, though the quality of the food was clearly of the lowest order.  All in all it is too obvious that the owners of this establishment care only for maximizing profit, at the cost of quality, taste, service and most of all, decency. Would not even recommend to my dog."}
{"text":"When tonight called ahead for takeout ready as promised Large chicken souvlaki salad huge came with pita and honey sticks great Greek fries rosemary and feta not great Service friendly have been many times  Small parking lot more in back Hugh portions also liked gyros"}
{"text":"This was my last try with the new owners. The service was painfully slow.  They substituted plain sour cream for tzikiki sauce and the pork was over cooked.   So disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting my parents. I was in the mood for something new, and I saw this place on yelp. I wanted to have good things to about this place, but the honest truth is that it's really lackluster. I ordered souvlaki pita. It didn't come with much garnish, the food was ok not great and I didn't really like the tsatziki. I honest think that you would be better off going to jimmy the greek or mr greek , both of which aren't terribly far away."}
{"text":"Go to the other souvlaki hut - this one is awful! Everything about the food is better at the other souvlaki hut - it SUCKs here! Rude and forgetful staff, small portions compared to other souvlaki huts"}
{"text":"It's been a few decades since I had real souvlaki in Greece, but I remember with not a small amount of nostalgia how the tiny cuts of meat melted in my mouth, the fresh and bold seasoning, the guy playing the guitar in my face waiting for me to toss him some Drachmas ...  The Souvlaki Hut is in a small-ish space nestled next to a Subway and across from a respectable Thai restaurant.  It is decked out with a fast food ambiance that is only half accurate: yes they have gyros and other American takes on Greek, but the Souvlaki is where they shine, it takes several minutes to prepare, and it is why I'd like to see a more elegant restaurant come out in a remodel.  The cuts of meat in the souvlaki are large, and seem to be quality meat although I did come across some tough parts.  The seasoning was about what I expected.  All the tasty sides they include are fun also; the Greek-style fries (sprinkled with finely crumbled feta) were fun, the rice and potato were a bit more authentic.  Check out the side salad: there is more going on under there than meets the eye.  And the glazed bananas were of course nice.  I came here twice, on the second visit correcting my first mistake and ordering the REGULAR sized lamb souvlaki dinner, and both times went away fat and happy."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  I ordered a small pork souvlaki dinner for $9.95 and it was anything but small.    For $9.95, you get: -A large skewer of pork souvlaki -Salad -Two carb sides (your choice of rice, fries, potatoes)  -Pita bread -A nice big scoop of tiziki for your meat/salad/bread.    The Greek salad was very fresh and the lettuce was very crispy.  The pork souvlaki was slightly on the tough side, but it was very tasty.    Overall, while this place is casual fast food, it is much better than Jimmy the Greek or Mr. Souvlaki as they cook it fresh for you.  I'd go back again when I'm very hungry. :-)  Yumm."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and let's say that the experience was different this time. The chicken was dry, the fries were soggy (but I guess that's what happens when you put them in a takeout container) and best of all, the \"tzatsiki\" was just straight up sour cream. Not sure what happened there, if they forgot to put the other ingredients but it was just straight up sour cream... Not sure we'll be ordering from this place again to be honest. The only thing that was still good was the chocolate baklava."}
{"text":"My first time visiting and ordered a Gyro sandwich (mix of beef and lamb... amazing!)on a pita.    Brought it home and it was delicious! Decent portioning, but the tzatziki sauce was a little too generous and tasted a little like sour cream I dont know why but the sandwich was good nonetheless.    My mom would like to mention that the 'garlic bread' (which is light garlic flavour put straight on a hot dog bun) is a little questionable. I tried it and it wasn't that garlic-y (I know that's not a word) but it was weird."}
{"text":"Had no expectations when I came here as it looks like a little hole in the wall selling greek food so I was a bit cautious with the food we got but I must say that it was pretty good.  We shared a chicken breast and It was a good portion with delicious sides.  Bottom line, great place to grab a gyro or a quick bite"}
{"text":"It's new and close to the beach! Friendly staff. Fresh salad with good feta cheese. Tasty chicken souvlaki. Too much onion and salt."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch and have a pita pork souvlaki & side salad. The food has always been fresh & tasty. Their service has been fast, courteous & friendly.  The cook takes a professional pride in his product and service.  A good local Greek eatery for eating in or take out service."}
{"text":"Very tasty Pork Souvlaki on a pita but extremely messy to eat.  Would be better if they offered it on a long bun.  I'm not sure how busy they get because the gyro machine wasn't even on and the meat was still uncooked.  Would never want to try that.  Once in a blue moon visit would be enough.  Not worth rushing back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places when I have a Greek food craving. The souvlaki dinners are the BEST deals around!  You get an authentic Greek salad with flatbread as a starter. The main comes 2-3 large potatoes and a rice - seasoned to perfection. My all time favorite is the pork souvlaki. Perfectly grilled over open flame, and never dry. And for dessert crispy honey cinnamon flatbread sticks.   The best of all, all of this for under $15!"}
{"text":"Not a bad deal for a sandwich.   Filing for a decent price. Not the best quality around but was satisfied with my meal"}
{"text":"We ate here when it was the weekend and all of the restaurants were busy except this and it was a nice experience. The portions are huge and I had a hard time finishing it. Or so I thought. Haha. But I was really full (not disgusting full, but healthy full) by the end of my meal and I dont regret finishing it off. Really recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Service is diabolical, wraps and pita are sloppy, too much sauce and onions on everything. Avoid."}
{"text":"Nice place, good sized portions, tasty food. Staff is nice and you don't have to wait a lot to be served. It is, though, on the pricey side. The Greek place at Cloverdale Mall is more affordable."}
{"text":"this is my third review for this establishment. We have spent hundreds of dollars with this establishment, and have been disappointed with their lack of accountability with the errors. Its one thing to say you are sorry and promise to fix it next time, however forgetting to correct it is very frustrating. Many times we have received missing items from our delivery orders we have been charged for them, however they never arrive. We are never offered a refund, however promised that the missing items would tbe added to our next order, which for the last 2 times has never happened, even after reminding them. We will not be ordering from them again and would advise other also."}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins to get my to-go order while I watched dine-in diners who ordered the same order after me get theirs in less than 10 mins, finish, and leave.  I got the lamb souvlaki dinner. The rice is super salty. Everything was super salty. However the potato did have a nice soft and creamy texture. It was still very salty. For almost $20, this was definitely not worth the price or wait. The family running this place wasn't even Greek. I'd rather eat Falafel Hut food again than this place.  This street is full of other better-looking food options, most likely with better service."}
{"text":"We dropped by on our way home Toronto and went to rouge Hill Park after.  This was the icing on the cake to an amazing day out.  The owner was very kind and inviting.  He let us try some of the rice and potatoes since we weren't too familiar with Greek food.  It was really delicious though.  Close to the highway and also you can go for a stroll along the lakeside after.  Really good experience and yummy food. We had the pork souvlaki and gyro sandwiches with Greek fries and rice and potatoes.  Really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Small, very welcoming place. Amazing food and LOTS of it!  I had the Large Gyro dinner and couldn't finish it.  They work very hard behind the counter and do a lot of take-out.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and BEST chicken souvlaki!  Tasty, moist, fresh and light. The place is super clean, so are the washrooms.  The soap smells divine. The employees were happy and having fun.   Service was quick although they made everything to order. Price is what you would expect. 12$ for a trio with salad.  I will be back"}
{"text":"You notice the great service from the second you walk in. A very nice and welcoming greeting. Ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner but wanted mostly salad with a tiny bit of rice so she recommended that I get the chicken salad because it was cheaper and that she'd throw in some rice at no cost. Bonus! The food arrived. Salad was perfect. Chicken was delicious but as the other reviewers mentioned, the portion was kind of small. Tried some of my girlfriends potatoes and gyros as well and they were really good as well. Ordinarily I would give 4 stars due to the portion size but the abundance of salad, the free rice and the complimentary dessert made up for it."}
{"text":"The worst service. I ordered a chicken souvlaki to go and after a half hour of waiting it still wasn't ready. They only had one other customer so it's not like they were busy. After 40 minutes we got our food from the owner. No sorry about the wait...."}
{"text":"We went here last Friday evening. Placed our order (2 sandwiches) and were told it will be ready shortly. It took them 25 minutes to do it. They kept saying yours is next every 5 minutes, which turned out to be just a lie. They had no problem lying in stead of being honest and saying there's a long wait, to give us, the customers, the chances to decide if we want to be held hostage for 30 minutes or go elsewhere. At the end the food was not even great. They have no Air Condition either and the place was really hot. The older woman behind the country lacks decorum and is in dire need of customer service!"}
{"text":"Really, I wanted to like this place so much.  I really really did.    Since our move to West Rouge 3 years ago, hubby and I have been on a hunt for a good group of restaurants to frequent.  When we saw the sign for Souvlaki Hut go up in this local plaza, we were thrilled because we are both huge gyro lovers and this place would be walking distance en route to a park we frequent nearby.  After many months of waiting, they finally opened their doors and we excitedly went over to check it out.  The small restaurant was crowded by one family hoarding the only available table and a few other patrons waiting to place their order.  There were 2 people working behind the counter, both double dutying as a cook and a cashier.  Very inefficient but maybe expected at a place that's only been open for a day or two.  The first time, we ordered small gyro dinner and a chicken souvlaki dinner.  We were told that it would take 15 - 20 min so after placing our takeout order, we walked over to the Shopper's next door to kill time and get out of the stuffy restaurant.  When we returned 20 minutes later, our order was nowhere to be seen and the 2 people behind the counter kept on with filling out other orders and taking new ones.    Finally after 45 min (from ordering), one of the cooks/cashier asks what we were waiting for.  I was pretty irritated at this point since she's been taking new orders and filling out other orders all the while we've been standing there with our receipt in hand.    An hour after the order was placed, we finally got our dinner and came home.  To add insult to injury, we were missing garlic bread (not that I really wanted it but if the menu says it comes with the meal, it should come with the meal.)  I was surprised that both the dinner portions were tiny (small 5 inch round containers) and the gyro was all dried out.  Ugh.  Nothing worse than rubbery gyro.  The chicken souvlaki, on the other hand, was decent.  However, with a price tag of $26+ for 2 small dinners seemed excessive for the quality of food.    Our second visit was for lunch and we decided to order their gyro pita special (2 gyro pita wraps for $10).  The service was much faster since there was no one else in there and the owner was nice enough to offer us a free brownie as well.  We took the wraps to the park and when we started eating it, yup, the same ol' dry gyro shavings.  Whew....    I'm not sure if I'm ready to boycott this place yet (like I did their neighboring Thai resto) but it's certainly been less than satisfactory so far."}
{"text":"This place is dynamite, the best Greek food in PC.  I get the Souvlaki salad about once (or twice) a week.  I want to try the other things on the menu, but I've already found perfection, haha.  I'm not sure about the service the reviews below are talking about, I've never waited terribly long, and I've always been super happy with my food!"}
{"text":"Honestly, a decent souvlaki is a good way too start off your movie night. The potatoes and rice are tasty and the sandwiches are nice & filling."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek for a quick lunch.  Hummus was how made and super tasty.  Love the desert ... pita lightly fried with honey and cinnamon.   I'd return"}
{"text":"I went to get lunch around 3PM after finishing a business call outside. The manager/owner saw me waiting at the cash register and came up and told me that he's not taking orders -- he's on break. I asked if there was somebody else that could take my order and he said no. Another potential customer came in and he refused to serve him too. I told him that he should have locked up and posted a sign that he was closed for the time being. Instead of taking my feedback and apologizing for the lack of service, he pointed out that I was standing out front on the phone -- implying that it's my own fault that he was not willing to serve me. His employees in the past have been amazing, which goes to show that all it takes is one bad experience..."}
{"text":"Tried the small Chicken Souvlaki dinner for pickup. Everything was wrapped neatly and still hot once I got home.   Rice - Cooked well typical Greek rice flavor. Good portion size you will definitely have leftovers.   Potatoes - Soft, nice herb seasoning no complaints here but I feel was kind of skimpy.   Chicken - Cooked over the flame thoroughly well seasoned.   Salad - Crisp veggies topped with Greek dressing and feta.   Tzatziki Sauce - Nothing new but tasted like it was in the fridge for a long time   Pita Bread - Bread.....   Honey Sticks - Yeah they advertise on their flyers, online, and menus but was told is not included when I went in -_-   Overall the food is okay nothing make its special. I was disappointed with certain portions such as the potatoes, the tzatziki sauce, and its kind of priced high for what you ultimately get. For the once in a while Greek food craving I guess it would suffice but that's about it in my opinion. 3.5"}
{"text":"Rip-off artists ... this joint used to be community-based, friendly and provided great service. Owners have changed - prices are now up, and the food and service have gone down. Once you get home you realize that not only has the order-taker gotten your phone-in order wrong (despite repeating it 3 times!) they've also neglected to give you the promised pop and honey stick! I'm done giving them second chances!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food, and this afternoon I was babysitting and decided to get food delivered from Souvlaki Hut. I went online to JUST-EAT and ordered 2 children meals and 1 adult meal.   The good:  1) The prices were decent. 2) I received a call from the restaurant asking me if I wanted Tzatziki for the children's meals since the meals technically do not come with Tzatziki--news to me, but great. 3) I asked for no onions, and there were no onions in the meals.  The bad:  1) Online it said that the meals come with honey pita sticks and we did not receive them. 2) The salad had absolutely no feta. Not a single smidgen of it. 3) All the meals were the exact same size! Yet, I paid $12 for the adult dinner and $9 for the kids dinner--we only got one salad so I am guessing I paid $3 for lettuce and 2 slices of tomatoes--with no feta! 4) Delivery took one hour and 15 minutes--and they are 3 blocks away! 5) When I asked about the missing items, they stated that it is JUST-EAT's fault because they should have removed the honey sticks from the menu. In other words, did not care about service.   So what now?  1) I have two upset children because they did not get their dessert. 2) I have deleted my account with JUST-EAT because their customer service was horrendous (I told them about the missing items and they did not give a damn!) 3) Not gonna buy food from this place again. All the drama and hassle is not worth it. I should have just ordered pizza!"}
{"text":"Honestly extremely poor greek food, the quality is very subpar. Look elsewhere for quality food as this place is really not good.    The service is also terrible, been here multiple times to \"give it a chance\" and consistently experienced unfriendly poor service. The owner seems cheap, if you order food that is not part of a dinner/meal he often times refuses to serve you.   Really not worth your money or time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to souvlaki hut. The first time was amazing! The portion Was huge- had the chicken souvlaki dinner with Greek salad. So much feta on new salad. It was fresh and so tasty. Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to get the large dinner and split it, seeing how the individual was so super big last time. Definitely  not impressed this time. Food was so bland, tazikiki had no taste ( just tasted like sour cream) and the salad was brown And oily.  I would have given a one star review, but the first time was so good. I was very disappointed, I love greek food."}

{"text":"I got takeout here tonight for the first time.  I called ahead and ordered a large chicken souvlaki dinner (wasn't sure of size but I figured why not). When I had arrived the total came to over 19$ which was a little bit of a shock but I paid and left anyways. Well now I know why. The large chicken souvlaki included a small salad (so much feta. Not complaining; just saying), a HUGE container of rice, potatoes and two chicken skewers, with a garlic bun and honey drizzled pita. This meal was massive. I could not come close to finishing even half. This could definitely feed two people which makes it like $9.50ish per person which is pretty average for quick Greek food. The food was not only huge, but it tastes amazing. Hot and fresh; probably some of the best Greek takeout I've had.   Would definitely recommend to try. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! It's a go-to for my family when we don't feel like cooking dinner. They never disappoint, everything is always fresh and delicious, their salads are amazing - they never skimp on the feta! And the gyros are just so damn satisfying. And the owners are so nice and friendly! Great place all around in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not too sure why there's so many negative reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food here! A little pricey, but the hummus & falafel were amazing. They also have their liquor license, and the wine goes very well with the food. Never been to the other location, but this one is great!"}
{"text":"great food, fast and polite workers :) recently I have a feeling prices have gone up so for a souvlaki sandwich it's about $10 incl tax. I still buy it whenever I pass nearby and haven't eaten anything :)"}
{"text":"Despite the other reviews, this is my go to Greek place in Port Credit. When you eat in, depending on what you order.. They first bring you the Salad and Pita Bread. I wish they brought the Pita Bread with the food though. The food does take a bit to come, but they cook the meat fresh on the grill. It is a bit pricey, but you get decent size portions. You get big pieces of meat, good portion of rice with tomato sauce and a few pieces of potatoes with the tomato sauce as well. They also bring you out warm honey pita sticks with cinnamon for dessert. It's delicious. The staff they have are actually very polite.. I've eaten here quite a bit and never had any issues."}
{"text":"Wow, I was really amazed when I walked in. It looked like a small take out Greek restaurant but what I didn't know was inside had ample seating for parties of 2 or 4. I would not recommend bringing a group bigger then that.   We ordered the special which were two gyros wraps that came with fresh veggies like cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce. The best part was the amount of meat that was in the wrap. Neither my partner nor I could finish the wrap because of all the amount of meat.   We also ordered a side of Greek fries which was heavenly and to die for. It had feta and oregano that made it very delicious!   Overall, I had a great experience for lunch. I would definitely go there again for a light snack."}
{"text":"Run by a really really nice family, the wife's name is Zaida. She has a great memory for repeat customers knows us by name. Everything is fresh, no complaints the meat is crispy and juicy. Best cheap eats in the neighborhood. I recommend you call ahead during peak hours they get really busy."}
{"text":"Wow! I was not expecting this place to be 5 star. I don't give many 5 stars out.   It was a snowy evening and all I wanted was greek food. I was too lazy to go anywhere further so I found myself going to souvlaki hut. I was greeted by a very nice older lady who was sweet as pie! She was lovely! The food was just what I had wanted and for the price -- totally worth it. I had it there but asked for to-go containers incase I didn't eat it. They brought all my food up to me half in to-go containers half on real plates because they knew I would eat the stuff on the plates. Very great food and so much of it! I really enjoyed the added honey pretzels? I don't know what you call them -- they were great!   I'll be back here, next time to bring my boyfriend. It was like I was eating at a fine dining restaurant in this little chain. Great - great. Great."}
{"text":"Hmm what to give this place?  Service alright but that doesn't fill my tummy, let's talk food!  The Pork and Chicken Souvlaki in a pita are the same price? Any place i've gone to pork always is a bit cheaper.   $10 for either? Most expensive pita i've seen and it's a standard size, nothing huge.   I've gone 3 times and same result. I've ordered the pork Souvlaki and 1/2 the meat is always burned. I wondered what the food would like if I asked for \"well done\"? I won't dare tread in those waters asking for such a request. Where is the Tzatziki? So little.   I've seen the place packed on Saturdays after people come out of that lounge so at 2:30 am almost anything tastes good. So it is expensive drunk food.  The food is edible to a point but for an averaged sized $10 Souvlaki wrap that is 1/2 burnt isn't impressive."}
{"text":"I'm a regular.  2 gyros for $10 cannot be beat.  Excellent fresh prepared food.  I've never been disappointed.  The owner is extremely friendly.My only criticism is that sometimes it can get very busy and you might have to wait a few minutes for your food. Great place!"}
{"text":"I used to get take out from here all the time because I worked next door and it was a 10 second walk.  I love Greek food, and eating healthy so I would only order the chicken greek salad.  The first time I ordered it I got a large and it was around 17 bucks which is a little much for takeout, but it was way too big. Too much chicken and lettuce!  From then on I ordered the small. Still a little overpriced in my opinion (around $12-15) but very generous portion size.  They also always threw in garlic bread and honey sticks which was delicious but I always felt so guilty for eating!  Overall delicious food, slightly overpriced but great service, ready within minutes and the staff are super friendly."}
