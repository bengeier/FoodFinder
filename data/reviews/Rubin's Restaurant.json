{"text":"I was at the Riddell football helmet plant. I saw Rubins yelped strong so I decided to pop in for breakfast. The corned beef omelette was great. The hash browns are the real deal. Crunchy on the outside. The large OJ is 12 ounces. I'm stuffed and have food left over. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This used to be a fabulous place for breakfast! Their French toast was the best around and I'd recommend it to everyone I brought there. Over the past year, the quality of food has steadily declined, as has the service. We've spoken to the manager several times, who said they changed cooks, and that they were working to improve. But today, I was served raw French toast (for the third time in a row), had ordered a side of home fries, which did not come out with my meal, but 6 minutes later after I reminded the server. Service was lousy - it's your job as a server to know what I've ordered and to not bring incomplete meals to the table - and I NEVER want to see the bottom of my coffee cup. No more chances, Rubin's."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Only 6 occupied tables at any time. Waitress seemed lost. It took 3 tries just to get drink orders correct then they were out of half the items we ordered. They certainly weren't busy so it makes you wonder why they were out of so many things?"}
{"text":"Dishonest employees. Terrible food and terrible service. They'd rather lie and steal from a disabled retired veteran than tell the truth."}
{"text":"my parents eat here weekly.. The service and the food during breakfast is good. Prices are average.  My dad goes here every Wednesday morning with the group of old guys to sit and talk. Lunch and dinner are less than average experiences. I would recommend this place only for breakfast. I know it doesn't make sense that my parents eat here weekly, but it is close to their house."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, good atmosphere, quick service all for relatively cheap.   Except for the cake that shit is expensive.... BUT GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad, but not one to rave about either - there are quite a few lackluster things that factor into just an average place. It is clean and cordial (decorated and furnished with nice style and is comfortable, inviting). Most of the food items I've eaten lack flavor and seems rather dry. The portions are average and the presentation of the food varies. The wait staff experience is also variable - I have had less than desirable experiences and very pleasant, with everything in between. If you like coffee, espresso and sweets, then there is a little extra offering and incentive for someone to come for just a piece of cake or pastry with many selections of hot drinks, coffees and teas. Average at best; though it could really be so much better."}
{"text":"Food is always good but service is lacking... waitress was very friendly but need a different hostess, young girl, very rude and not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Deja Vu.  Menu reminds me of Joe's Deli in Rocky River, but cheaper. 

Rubin's was a positive surprise.   Clean and comfortable.   Portions are not as heaping as Joe's,  but very  satisfying.  I'm totally OK with that. 

This was my first visit and definitely not my last.  I enjoyed my wrap and the fries were hot.  Brittany provided great service even though she had a few tables.   She was in the back and kept peeking at her tables to make sure everything was good. 

I kept driving past this place thinking it was a dinky dump.   What a pleasant surprise !  

Next time I take my mom to the Cleveland Clinic,  I'll treat her to lunch.   The deserts behind the glass look good,  too.

{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the wife. From the outside, I thought we were walking in to a small, older diner. Turns out it was bigger,cleaner, and more modern looking than I would have guessed.

Service was good. Hostess and waitress were pleasant. I ordered a half pound burger ($8) and cole slaw ($2). Wife had a stir fry wrap sandwich ($8). Food seems fresh and tasty. I ordered the burger well done, but still had a little pink. The wrap my wife felt was a little strong tasting of soy sauce and said it would have been better if it was served over rice instead of the wrap. Both sandwiches came with a small bag of chips. 

Over, things were good and we will go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with co-workers and was initially confused about where we were because right when you walk in, it looks like a coffee shop with a coffee menu a large case with cakes but the tables are actually located on the sides of the restaurant.

The menu was large and had a lot of options. I ordered a garden salad with olives, tomatoes, and feta cheese. The salad was large enough that I was satisfied and the food came out fairly quickly. The waitress was very friendly and fast. 

Overall a good place for lunch"}
{"text":"This used to be my fav take out place when I lived in Elyria. Chicken wraps are super delicious. Fries are crispy. Reasonably priced. Open super late. People rave about the Rubens, they have a ton of meat."}
{"text":"Just as good as the flagship restaurant on Leona Street. Food is excellent and there is even an Arabica coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Terrible food,  ive should have known by no one else in the restaurant. You wont be seeing me again"}
{"text":"This is a tale of two restaurants. The original, by Midway Mall, is great. Never had any problems in all the times I have been there.
This location, at Chestnut Commons, is a completely different story. I usually have some sort of unnecessary and utterly avoidable problem when I come here. Service is incredibly slow for no apparent reason, the order is wrong, bill is wrong, waiting to be seated when nobody is there, etc. It's why I stopped coming.
I finally came back today, and since it is pretty cold, I ordered the matzoh ball soup.  I was amazed to find that the matzoh ball was cold. Not just room temp, but actually cold in the center, like it had come out of the fridge or freezer. The broth itself was lukewarm. The server was very good, and the rest of my meal was fine, but it is yet another problem that just shouldn't happen.
I hate to post negative reviews of local businesses, because I strongly believe in and support the local economy. However, there just seems to be a chronic issue with details at this place. I will continue to go to the Midway location,  but I am done with the frustration of the Chestnut Commons restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick soup and salad on wed night. A few tables were occupied. Ordered a glass of Merlot and the soup of the day and a salad. The soup was warm and very salty   Bottom of the pot maybe. The salad was great fresh crisp greens nice lemon and EVO dressing fresh tomato and cucumber   Service was prompt sand attentive   I'll try this place again"}
{"text":"Lol...as far as corned beef sandwiches go, Rubin's is so stingy with the meat!! I'll gladly pay for a well stocked corned beef sandwich! Please.... Be generous! :(      Visit Superior deli in Cleveland!!! Then you'll know how a REAL corned beef sandwich is made. Just a tip..
Also, check out Ontario bar, on Ontario, in Cleve. omg....great corned beef sandwich. It's definitely a hole in the wall, but this chef knows what he's doing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once, but i had a good time. The food was good and came out quick and the waiting staff was nice and problem free. I'd definitely come back again if given the chance."}
{"text":"The neighborhood, like the strip mall Rubin's calls home, is a bit beat up and showing its wear. This, coupled with the dingy and dare I say tacky decor, led us initially to call into question our choice to jump 10 minutes off the turnpike based on the great reviews Rubin's receives on this site. However, the friendly staff and mouthwatering desserts in the cooler quickly helped turn the tide in Rubin's favor before the food helped keep it moving in the right direction. 

The menu selections offer something for everyone, and our table took full advantage: Lake Erie perch sandwich (Fri. lunch special), kids' pasta and sauce, Philadelphian sandwich and a ham & cheese omelet. 

The perch, while somewhat overcooked, had a tasty breading, and the fries that accompanied it were crispy, hot and not too salty. The omelet was fluffy and to expectations, but the potatoes served with it stole the show -- thinly sliced, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Phiadelphian's juicy pastrami and just-right right amount of coleslaw and dressing, was just as good as the rye slices between which it was sandwiched. The cheap bag of chips served on the side didn't do it justice. The pasta and sauce were OK, but save that order for an Italian place. 

Overall, a pretty good place for breakfast or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Really great food, service!  The menu is pretty big; there's a separate breakfast menu from the lunch/dinner menu.
I ordered a coffee and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and wheat toast.  Everything was perfect and nothing was greasy.  The dining room was very neat and clean, and the server refilled coffee in a timely way and was friendly and efficient.  This is a great place if you're in Elyria and need a quick coffee or a bite to eat.  
Also, know that it's joined up with an arabica, so if you need your daily coffee fix, you can just pop in."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. The corned beef hash and poached eggs were very tasty. Wish the breakfast menu was a little more extensive.  The oj was not fresh squeezed. Decor was very plain; typical of northern Ohio....Amish contemporary.  I really wanted some healthier options, but since there wasn't many, I went all out with the unhealthiest."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this place is amazing, but it's a nice little quaint place. The Chicken Teriyaki Wrap tends to be soggy, and eventually tears the pita bread. It tasted good I must say though. Their cold wraps are pretty descent, but I kinda feel the price is a little high (not too bad though) for what you get. I would definitely come here again though. It's got pretty descent food."}
{"text":"I've only been to Rubin's twice, but it has really stood out. The first time I went there for dinner with my parents because we were out and about and heading to Nancy's in Grafton, but they were closed and I had heard of Rubin's and knew it was close so there we went. 

The atmosphere was just fine; the quaint dining room. I got the fish sandwich (can't remember if it was perch) and I don't remember what my parents ordered, but we all were very happy with the service, prices, and of course the food. The second time I went there with a buddy while we were about town near there and I was overwhelmed with the deli sandwich options; that's a good thing. I knew I wanted corned beef, but they offer many appetizing sandwiches that incorporate it. I ended up with a monster of a sandwich that was piled high with turkey, corned beef, lettuce, and tomato. Again, the service was great. My buddy's Italian sausage sandwich was pretty good too.

It doesn't hurt I met the owner before when I attended a wine tasting at Midway Liquors, which he also owns (not sure if each Rubin's location has a different owner) but he's a very nice guy and of course Rubin's food was featured at this wine tasting and the selection there, although basic, was good.

I'd recommend Rubin's to anyone and definitely will go again when I'm in the area or want a good sandwich. Kudos, my friends."}
