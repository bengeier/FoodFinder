{"text":"Sunny Side Up is a cute new little cafe/boutique that opened a couple of months ago. A friend came into town so I thought this was a good opportunity to check out this place. There might be a table or 2 inside, but sitting under the shade at 7am was very comfortable. Our meals were brought out promptly: my friend go the signature sandwich, which he liked, and I got the Artisan (brie/bacon/egg/spinach) sandwich, which was quite tasty. Each breakfast sandwich came on a toasted english muffin and was accompanied by a side of fresh fruit (pineapple, orange, grape, honeydew and watermelon!). What I liked most was that the portion wasn't oversized and it did not feel greasy. At $6-7 for a breakfast sandwich, it's not super cheap, but the quality and the service were great.

I did not go through the gallery as we had limited time, but I will definitely peruse this store on a later day."}
{"text":"So, on one of my many walks, I happened to pass what seemed to be another interesting gallery on Murray Hill road in Little Italy. However, little did I know there was more than good taste in art waiting inside.

Sunny Side Up is a combo mini-gallery and breakfast nook full of tastes for the soul and the eyes, with jewelry and knick-nacks as well as some really interesting wall art. I, myself, had their \"artisan breakfast sandwich\", which was a tasty egg/spinach/brie combo on a whole grain English muffin with a side of fruit. With coffee, it was certainly refreshing. Other items on the menu include Their \"egg in a pepper\" and their \"Bumblebee\", a combo of chunky peanut butter, sliced bananas and honey on oat nut bread. Inside the boutique gallery there is a section for bakery, made, I would guess, on premises, and looking very appetizing and, if I wasn't watching my weight, I'd have taken a bit home. One of the drawbacks is, at least right now, the only seating is outdoors with sidewalk cafe-style sit down. There are some parking spots along the back as well as the street, but you might want to make this a little walking stop on your morning jaunt like I did.

The owner is a cordial, king gent who was very attentive and I have to say, Sunny Side Up certainly did make my day a little more sunny, and it might do the same for you:)"}

{"text":"Just got back from having a great little breakfast at Sunny Side Up.  I'd been stalking this place since it opened, but had waited to check it out until it was reviewed here on Yelp.  But now I'm kind of kicking myself for waiting so long.  This place is so neat!

You'd think that an art gallery/cafe might be an odd mix, but Sunny Side Up makes it work.  There are two large storefront rooms filled with everything from glassware, to jewelry, to wall art, and and all kind of things in between, all crafted by artists here in the CLE.  This is definitely the kind of place to check out if you're looking for a thoughtful and unique gift for someone.  

Tucked in a far corner of the gallery space is a counter where you can pick up a menu and place your order.  I interacted with the man George S. referred to (he's not the owner, for the record, but if I were an owner, I'd want an employee like him.)  The man behind the counter was serving double duty as shop-keep and food maker from what I could tell.  But he was super friendly and told us a little bit about the store and how their baked goods are sourced locally, too.  (I didn't have a chance to try and baked goods but everything looked amazing)

Not sure where you'd sit in inclement weather (there aren't any tables inside) but my friend and I sat in a shady corner of the front patio area.  Our food was ready in a jiffy and was fresh and flavorful.  I got the peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich.  It came with a nice side of fruit.  All for $5!  My friend got one of the many egg dishes on the menu.  She said she really enjoyed it.  But what we  really enjoyed was getting to enjoy a nice chat over breakfast at such a neat little place.

I highly recommend checking out Sunny Side Up if you happen to be in Little Italy or are looking for a nice little laid back spot to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is an awesome out of the way little place for breakfast/lunch.
It is an art gallery/coffee/breakfast/lunch place. I know its a lot. It is on a quiet little street and has some nice cafe style table out front. Someone else mentioned I am not sure where you would sit inside as there are no tables, but I am sure they will figure that out as the summer rolls away. 

I love getting the delicious peanut butter banana and honey sandwich and having some nice quiet time at lunch outside. 

I love secret little places and thats exactly what this feels like."}
