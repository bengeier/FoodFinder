{"text":"Bomb.com so juicy and fresh tasting, I absolutely would recommend eating here. I love Philly cheese steak sandwichs and this place has them on point, if you haven't been here I don't know what you are waiting for!"}
{"text":"Wasn't acknowledge waiting at the counter so I had no idea what i was to do. I then saw my food sitting on a cold shelf for 10 minutes (who knows how long before I got there) sitting there at the counter while everyone else was serviced. I know it was mine because when someone finally decided to ask me what I'm waiting for they searched before handing me that bag. Then it gets worse. I ask for no onions or peppers yet I still find them scattered through my sandwich. The final straw is when I bit into whatever it is I have attached a picture of. I'm assuming it's a huge hunk of fat but it was like biting into a plastic chew toy. I threw the sandwich away immediately, disgusting"}
{"text":"Best Philly with Pastrami ever! I was in a few days ago and forgot to post. Very quick and friendly. I had my order in minutes and let me order technically before they even opened for the day. If you're ever downtown  and looking for something filling this is a great stop. Multiple restaurants in same location. So if someone with you is a bit pickier there is a ton to  choose from. Honestly though for you philly cheese stake lovers check it out!"}
