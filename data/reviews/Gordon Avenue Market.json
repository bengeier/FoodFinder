{"text":"Really bad quality food that's way overpriced. There were cases of E. coil a few months back that they tried to hide but students were hospitalized. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If there's one word to describe it, it is complacent. A cafeteria style location that is focused more on productivity than quality. If you aren't in college, don't come here too often, fresh market is a few blocks away and you can make many a delicious meal with the goods they have to offer."}
