{"text":"The chicken was very delicious the price  was great. It was 18 dollars for a 15 piece chicken all carbon  tortillas and salsa and onions  so good"}
{"text":"All the way from Stockton, California we give Pollo Corretiado 5 star rating. Food was delicious sides perfect and service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum. Coworker insisted on going here and so off we went. Very skeptical from the outside and was completely blown away by how good this chicken was. I didn't know chicken could be this good! Tiny hole in the wall place, handful of selections, very reasonable. We got the $5 lunch special. 3 pieces of chicken, tortillas (which are beyond amazing), salsa and a can soda. It was amazing. I stopped the next day and took a whole chicken home for dinner. And now I am writing this review and my mouth is watering and I am craving the chicken again and will stop Monday and bring home dinner again! Only 3 small boots and some stools to sit at but at lunch we crammed on in and really enjoyed our meals. No one was disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is great but a huge   \"BUT\"

When you order the special of 10 pieces for 11 bucks plus tax on the window.  To cut the thigh pieces in half, I am sorry but that is complete fucking bullshit.  I don't know if they do that shit in Latin America to up the numbers.  But that was the most deceptive fucking horseshit I have ever witnessed at any restaurant my entire life.  Some of those thighs might have been split into 3rds.  no joke.   Came out in my estimate to about 6 or 7 pieces.  Legs weren't split.  So the deal is 6 or 7 pieces for 12 bucks out the door.  Now is it that great of a deal?  Not really.

How about the food.   Only thing that saved this place is the food is great.  Good solid El Pollo Loco chicken flavor, but actually tasted better grilled over actual mesquite wood.  You get corn torillas.  A bunch.   Also get a good salsa that has a hint of carrot flavor that beat El Pollo Loco, and a couple jalapenos that were deep fried and had a type of soy sauce flavor on them, some lemons and pickled onions.  Honestly it was a great change of pace from El Pollo Loco.

But and I mean a huge BUT.  Cutting pieces in half is in a way false advertising and stealing from the customer.   Will I ever go back.  Maybe or maybe not.   I haven't decided yet."}
{"text":"This place has probably the best grilled chicken in town. Your mouth will be watering at the moment you park your car here because of the smell of grilled chicken.
The price is fairly cheap.
People are also very nice and friendly.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Come here very often and today they tried to charge me $1 for each SMALL salsa. I've never paid for them."}
{"text":"I love this place their pollo asado is the best in town. The flavor is very unique and their customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is delicious. I have been going here for the past 3-4 years from time to time and the food is always great. I definitely recommend you try them out!"}
{"text":"Awesome  chicken. I buy at least two to three chicken deals when I visit. It still never lasts very long.  So good."}
{"text":"El Pollo Correteado is a small bare bones casual fast food shack that serves mesquite charcoal cooked chicken. Inside is only three tables but they also offer some bench seating outside. You walk up to the counter and order either a half chicken ($6.57 April 2018 pricing). or a whole chicken. We ordered half chickens. Our chicken came with pickled onions, hot chili peppers, lemon, salsa and a stack of seven tortillas each. 

I received a delicious but funny looking half chicken. My half chicken had three legs and two thighs. My husband's half chicken also had three legs, two thighs and part of a breast. The chicken was delicious and moist by it's self.....But you have to squirt it with lemon and try it in the fresh corn tortillas with all the toppings to get the full experience. 

Besides the chicken they sell a few sides such as beans, macaroni salad and mashed potatoes. I saw a sign for a ten piece special too.

This isn't a fancy place. I don't think anyone would ever take a date here but the Chicken is delicious and our meals were only $6.57 each!"}
{"text":"Best chicken in town! Went yesterday for the first time and the customer services was top notch, tons of food for a great price, I personally think the half chicken can feed 2 people. Comes with tortillas and salsa, onions chiles toreados, and limes. You can also get beans pasta or mash potatoes on the side that they warm up for you. Over all great experience. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled chicken, fresh tortillas, good sides and salsas....decent prices and family specials as well. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Omg. This chicken is freaking delicious. The flavor is so good and the pricing isn't too bad but i definitely recommend this place if you're looking for grilled chicken
  Tastes so authentic"}
{"text":"Food is simple and delicious! Get ready to get your hands dirty. There's no forks necessary here.  Rotiserie chicken, a simple salsa, warm tortillas, and canned/bottled drink. Love it!
The salsa is simple and tangy. It can hardly be called spicy, but quite tasty. They also have roasted jalapenos, pickled purple onion, and go at it. 
When you order your options are a whole chicken or 1/2 chicken. The cook will chop it into pieces for you.  
The place is covered with the color orange, casual, indoor and outdoor dinning with a small tv for a spanish soap opera."}
{"text":"This definitely is the spot for great roasted  chicken. Reminds me of chicken back in the Philippines, tasty and juicy! This won't hit your wallets either as the prices are more than reasonable. Im always the only asian that will come and eat there chicken as the owner isn't very fluent in English. lol. If in Phoenix definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Went there earlier this week for my first time. Co-worker and I went for lunch so we got the full chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and two drinks; it came out to $24. Chicken was flavorful but not worth what we paid. Something else that was bothersome was that they charge you if you pay with a card and prices listed on menu & windows are not accurate. Definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sinaloa-style grilled chicken at a good price. You're not going to get many frills here but that's ok. It's just grilled half ($6.50) or whole ($13) chicken that comes with tortillas, limes/lemons, salsa, roasted peppers, and pickled onions. And that's about it. Be prepared to habla a little espanol, but it's not too intimidating if you don't. The chicken is well marinated and has crispy, smoky skin. It might be a little on the small side by our giant steroid-pumped american chicken standards but it's authentic and delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, clean, just remember to take a knife and fork. 
First time customer and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a gut feeling blindly. looked on yelp earlier in the day but this place didn't pop up for whatever reason.  While I was driving to the place I was going to go to... I  saw all these people there so gave it a shot and glad that I did. Six tortillas a half roasted chicken and all kinds of condiments like lemon, onion, jalapenos,salsa,ect. for $7.00 Delicious, Cheep, and Quick I will definitely be hitting this little spot next time on this side of town. I should have ordered a whole chicken it was so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"This was THE best chicken that I've ever had!!! Very simple menu and amazingly delicious! It was so good that we took food to go home for later!! It's so worth the drive from anywhere. Bonus is that it was so very clean! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm back to a mostly low carb diet.  There aren't a ton of options while eating out (that taste good, anyways!) on a low carb diet.  Back in San Diego, when I was trying to lose some pounds, my go to low carb meal was grilled chicken.  There were a handful of REALLY GOOD spots where I could get my chicken fix.  So far, here in Phoenix, I found one real good spot and a few ok spots.  Decided to try my hand at El Pollo Correteado.  Driving down McDowell, you can't miss the bright orange spot...right off 29th.

I walked in and placed my order for a half chicken and a bottle of water.  Total was around $9.50.  The guy grabbed my condiments (lemons, pickled onions, jalapenos and salsa), my bag of corn tortillas and then put my styrofoam container of chicken on the tray.  Here is how it was............

Half Chicken-  When I opened my container, I noticed that this 1/2 bird was a little bit skimp.  It almost seemed like half of a half of a chicken.  Taste was fine...good grilled crispy skin, citrus marinated flavors and the chicken was moist.  The condiments were great too.  I loved the pickled onions and their salsa (reminded me of Titos salsa...a bit runny but very fresh).  I loved the fact that they give you about 8 corn tortillas, too.  I'm not supposed to be eating carbs, but I couldn't resist and had a few of the tortillas.  I made myself some mini tacos.  Anyways....I finished my meal and was out.

Overall, I thought everyhing was ok.  The chicken was a tad skimp for the price though and this place is pretty deep away from where I live/work so I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.  If you live in the area though, and want some good tasting grilled pollo, this is a good spot to come to.  Good for Phoenix, but my spots in San Diego are much better!"}
{"text":"I admit it looks a little sketchy from the outside, but in my experience that just means it's good. I love trying new spots in the valley.  This place is basic simple and damn good. We had the whole chicken with beans and tortillas. Limes an hot sauce perfect"}
{"text":"Heard about Pollo Correteado through some friends on the 4th of July. Of course, I had to go about the next day to try it. I'm always searching for the next great foodie venture. We call to place an order, but there were about to close. They were kind enough to way an additional 15 minutes for us to drive over for our Take out order. We paid (there's a sign that says Cash only) and when we got back into the car, the smell of the food was AMAZING. Note, I'm not sure if this a Mexican or Peruvian food, but it is AMAZING! We got home and opened up that delicious meal! The chicken was rotiserie, the tortillas might have been home made, the onions were amazing, the salsa was fresh with the perfect amount of heat, they used white beans, and their Mash potatoes were not what you would expect... THEY WERE BOMB.com

You're welcome in advance if you used my review to lead you to this tiny little jewel!"}
