{"text":"What happened? This used to be my favourite place for felafel but how things change. The open tables are gone, replaced by booths and the prices have increased as well. Since a simple felafel wrap was over 5 bucks, I thought I'd get better value with the felafel plate. Wrong. I got four dry felafel balls on rice with undressed lettuce and the usual sides. Thank god I got the hummous, tzatziki and garlic sauce because they masked the dryness and high sodium content. And this cost me over $8.00.  Oh, and the current staff, while polite, can't hold a candle to the cute Turkish men who used to work there.  I need to find a new spot. Any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Been on a quest for a Montreal-comparable \"shish taouk\" / shawarma place, and thus far, this place takes the cake. Their turnips are perfectly marinated, the chicken is pretty flavourful, the sauces are yummy, and the service was extremely friendly (perhaps too much so - got a couple of winks at the cash). My one complaint is that the pita totally fell apart - i wish it had been wrapped in aluminium and that they hadn't stuffed it so much with lettuce. One thing they are missing is legit Amir garlic mayo and perfectly marinated chicken. 

All in all though, it was a yummy, tasty experience. Highly suggest it to all you ex-Montrealer's out there!"}
{"text":"Sorry A La Turque. I kept my 4-star review up as long as possible, but I'm done with you now. You can keep my Mariah Carey CD, but please don't call me anymore. We're through and there's nothing you can do about it.

Every time I go to A La Turque these days the chicken has been pre-cut and is waiting in a heating tray. The veggies are still decent, but not as fresh as when it first opened. The staff never leave the kebab on the grill for long enough. The prices have been increased. Everything is a lot more lax than it used to be.

It's really a shame because there aren't any good doner/shawarma places in the area anymore. If you of you know about one, then let me know!

I miss you...."}
{"text":"I haven't given a review this poor before however this place was hugely disapointing. The food was so bad and i would never ever return here! 

I had a chicken shawarma plate which was so bad - the meat was stale, the rice was stale and the whole thing was flavourless. And it was quite pricey for the quality of the food. I am surprised they are in business with such great middle eastern options in the area and city!"}
{"text":"I will not eat there again. I won't bother to complain about how long I waited for my lunch order, considering there was only one person working at the time, but said person prepared the shawarma, handled my cash, and touched the revoltingly dirty register using the same pair of gloves. Disgusting! He didn't bother to change gloves in between orders either. The chicken swawarma itself was forgettable. I was starving and had waited a long time for it, so I still ate it anyway..."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing until new owners. The chicken for the shawarma has gone from delicious to dry. Or oily and greasy. My roommate got half the amount of chicken the man behind us in line got and it was tough and unpleasant. Will give it one more try myself but really don't think it's worth it anymore. Also atmosphere is dead and awkward. Owner and multiple workers all standing and sitting around watching the one or two people in line order. Very dead air and awkward atmosphere."}
{"text":"A bit of a doner downer...

Hunting for new lunch spots, we wanted to give A La Turque a try.
I had the beef doner kebob...
* Way too many pickles
* Flavorless meat  :(
* It wasn't grilled nearly enough
* Overpriced

The zucchini and eggplant sides were sitting there cold, didn't look all that appetizing...
They give you one super useless napkin..
They brought us one styrofoam cup of water even though there was two of us...

I ordered the feta-spinach roll for 80 cents.
It was the smallest roll I've ever seen.
I mean for 80 cents, I didn't expect it to be a monster.
...hey, size matters when you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here cause I was craving shawarma. I was looking for the garlic sauce I craved so bad but they don't have it. Aside from that the veggies kinda tasted funny to me. Overall my craving wasn't satisfied plus they only accept cash so I had to run to td to get some even when it was poring rain outside."}
{"text":"been here a few times, since Im a local, but I dont think its that good. Their sandwiches fall apart, not super flavourful, not great value. I returned here recently to do a comparison, and I prefer Ghazale a block away.  Only had shawarma sandwiches from here"}
{"text":"Very average Middle Eastern cuisine.  This place honestly just depresses me a little bit.  It could be the guy behind the counter who might be the proprietor.  He often engages customers in conversation which ranges from just fine to depressing complaints about business to tetchy political topics.  I just want a falafel, thank you!

The FOOD: The falafel are not made fresh.  They use the prepare early in the day and microwave method.  The shawarma, which has recently been limited to the chicken variety seems to alternate between dry and greasy...I'm sure there's a happy medium in here.  They seem to have trouble timing when to cut bits off the roasting spit...my chicken has been pretty cold when I get it.   I'm with Steph L, this is a bit of a DÃ¶ner Downer ;) 

I don't feel like they're very careful with food hygiene here.  They seem to re-use gloves often going back and forth between the cash register and the food prep area.  Unfortunately, they've just handled money and are now touching the outside of the gloves in the process.  No handwashing in between.  I don't think that's a best practice.

OVERALL, not my favorite place.  From now on, I recommend Ghazale for their lentil soup or Ali Baba for their falafel.  If you want to walk a bit further, go to Paramount."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but it looks like a year ago or so they got new management. The portions are smaller, the chicken shawarma is fatty. It never used to be like this. Before they used to toast/fry the chicken a little and it gave it an added texture that made it different than other shawarma places, and the portions also used to be bigger. So I went from visiting them a couple of times a week, to 0. I have no immediate plans to return.

**I believe it is still cash only. Also, today I saw a sign stating that they are getting new management. Again? If you are constantly changing management, that draws suspicion."}
{"text":"I had heard that this place makes a decent shawarma, so I went out of my way to check it out. I walked in at 1:17 on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was empty. I noticed a man sitting at a table, with his back to me, filling out paperwork, and there was also a woman farther back, also filling out paperwork and also with her back to me.

I stood there for five minutes hoping that one of these idiots would notice me but alas, they were too wrapped up in their seemingly fascinating paperwork. I walked out and vowed never to return."}
