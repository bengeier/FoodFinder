{"text":"I was never really a NY style pizza fan, until we tried this place. My husband works nearby and decided to pick up a pizza on the way home one night- needless to say, we haven't ordered crappy chain delivery pizza since!

The pies are huge and loaded with toppings. Delicious! Their garlic knots aren't bad either."}
{"text":"This is pretty good, and reasonably priced, NY style pizza.  The atmosphere is low key and cool, and the staff is friendly.  The cheese they use on the pizza seems to be of a quite bad quality -- not stringy at all, and a bit lumpy.  If they improved the cheese, this would definitely be a four star pizza place.  For now, as far as I'm concerned, it ties with Fuel and comes in a little behind Hawthorne's, which remains Charlotte's best NY pizza."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time today on a whim after reading all the good reviews. The pizza is amazing  we're new to the area and hadn't had good pizza in a while. Luigi's definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Crust too thick. I had the personal pizza. Not horrible Pizza but a little bland. I needed tons of Parmesan and pepper. Parmesan cheese isn't on every table so I had to hunt down the container from another table."}
{"text":"All great food! top notch New York style pizzeria...i was a little skeptical when my brother told me about this place i was like \"good pizza in the Charlotte?...HA!\" but i was definitely impressed... having had the chance to have different pizza all over the world i have to say that NY style pizza is the best and Luigis is worthy of checking out. the owners are originally from Brooklyn NY and brought there pizza making skills with them. they have multiple locations in the charlotte area steele creek has the most classic NY pizzeria feel while the East blvd location has more of a trendy urban feel- either way the food is great, check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  This is now one of my favorite pizza places on the east coast!  Pavone's in Syracuse is still king though!!"}
{"text":"Im from out of town and was looking for a good place to eat pasta. I had the best spaghetti and meatballs from this restaurant, the sauce was a delicious. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the chance to recently sneak over to Luigi's pizza on a Friday night with my family for a quick bite. I had never been here, but heard very good things about the  place as it's won some awards around Charlotte. We were not disappointed.

Luigi was actually around brought out our food. Before ordering I had asked him what he recommended. He talked me into a steak and cheese sub and I was not disappointed. My wife, who is a fair weather vegetarian, had a bite and finished off half of my sandwich. It really was delicious. Luigi also brought us out a cheese and pepperoni pizza for the kids. It was great as well.

This place has a great atmosphere and feels like a NY pizzeria. Luigi is first-generation from Italy and has honed his pizza skills over the years. We certainly will return and recommend others to try to help."}
{"text":"Great Pizza... can't say enough about the SIZE of their single slices, holy cow.  My friends at work warned me, but still.  
Delicious pizza, just the way I like it

I'm not going to give it 5 stars only because I think 5 is reserved for something completely special and rare, but it doesn't take away from the taste of their pizza.  It's very good!"}
{"text":"Still the best pizza around but today I want to tell you my favorite thing about Luigi's. They make an awesome Veal Parmesan sub. Not to many people serve veal around here so it's a real treat to get a great veal parm sub and a slice for around 10 bucks. it's good veal too. Not that ground up crap other people call veal. Reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Fantastic New York Style Pizza!! Great little pizza joint."}
{"text":"Woo-hoo!  This is the best pizza that I have had in years.  The last time I had such good pizza was in San Diego at Ocean Beach where all the poor college students congregated for 99 cent slices.  The jumbo single cheese slices were out of this world... dripping with sauce and goodness... i love the crust too.  And this place remakes those memories with wonderful, tasty, delicious pizza slices.  The crust is simply to live for!  Chicago has great pizza too but for me nothing beats this pizza in CLT!"}
{"text":"Luigi's sells authentic NY style pizza.  I grew up in NY and spent years looking for good pizza in Charlotte, I finally found it when I went to Lugi's.

The crust has the right combination of crunchyness and chewyness that makes or breaks NY pizza.  The sauce has the right flavor and is always applied in the right quantity.  The cheese is the right style, and is not too greasy (NY pizza should have some greese).

The subs are also excellent.  The veal parm is real veal cutlets, not the pressed hockey pucks served by some other local shops.  The chicken parm is fresh breaded.  The sausage and peppers is excellent.

I have never had a bad experience at Lugi's, it is the best pizza shop in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best NY pizza and sandwiches/calzone etc. in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"For leaving me BEREFT, Luigi's, and without delicious pizza, I give you ONE STAR.

I hate you for closing."}
{"text":"About the closest to NY style pizza as you will get in Charlotte. Slices as big as your head. If you can eat 2 slices you are guaranteed to have a heart attack by 40.

Pepperoni pizza can be greasy. I like sausage. It tends not to be greasy and tastes awesome. I've had the best pizza in NYC's lower east side (Rosarios) and I can tell you that Luigi's will not disappoint. 

The line can get quite long during lunch time and seating is limited."}
{"text":"I've never had real NY pizza before but as a Charlottean, Luigis is it for me! I usually order by the slice, which are huuuge! I'm such a regular the pizzamen already know my order when I walk in the door. Talk about good customer service! This place is usually packed around lunch time due to the businesses in the area. I always say I'd like to try the Steak & Cheese sandwich but the pizza is just sooo good."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great calzones. When they get the order right. And when they have the ingredients to make what's on the menu. 

Last few several times I ordered they did not. Last week they didn't have dough! So, tonight they got it wrong.  But they offered to make another calzone for us, which was nice. So I drove down to pick a second one. After I get home the owner called to check up on it--but I think she really called because I ate part of the first one!  So they goofed up the order then give me grief about it? How can you know it's wrong unless you at least take a bite?

I'll try this place a couple more time--like I said, the pizza is really good. But they've got to get it together!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for New York style pizza! The prices are cheap and the slice is so big! I loveeeeee it!"}
{"text":"My exhausted family arrived at 6:15 after a long day of driving, ordered slices, and we were told it was too late to get slices - they close at 7:00. We ordered a whole pizza instead, and as we waited, I was just irritated. Hungry, tired, and conned into spending way more money? Irritated. And then the pizza came. Great crust, great sauce, lots of cheese, and FRESH basil. No longer irritated. I hated having leftovers we couldn't save, but We all really enjoyed the food. We are huge NY pizza snobs - loved their pie!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte, nobody else is even close!  These guys do it right; everything from the bread the ship in for their subs to the perfect, thin, NY style pizza.  I would eat here everyday, but I would be as big as a house...  I love this place!  Really nice people as well.  You can tell they are a family business the moment you want through the door."}
{"text":"This place is great. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and the cost was very reasonable. The size was huge. But most importantly, the taste was fantastic. I'm from Brooklyn, NY and this pizza is as close to what I remember as pizza gets. The service is good, and the employees were courteous."}
{"text":"They do a very good rendition of New York style pizza.... so if you like that, and are into it... this is a 5 star joint. It certainly reminds me of some of the pizza places I've visited in NYC: fast, no frills atmosphere... etc.

I guess I just don't get NY style pizza...  kinda greasy....

They have some sub/sandwiches on the menu... I want to go back and try those, as they looked quite good...."}
{"text":"Best NYC pizza you can find in charlotte. Good calzone I love their sauce. Slices are huge. 

This is the closest pizza I can find to what we have back home. I can't want to try the veal parmigiano next time."}
{"text":"take it from an italian american new yorker..... best pizza in charlotte"}
{"text":"Delicious New York style pizza and fast, friendly staff. They do a great job keeping the tables clean even when it's busy, but there's not a lot of seating and during the lunch rush hour you may have to wait for a table or be prepared to take your food to go. 

There is a decor on two of the walls that gives the impression of a pizza cafe in Italy. Pizza is great, price is very reasonable, and the garlic knots are fantastic. I visit Luigi's every couple weeks or so for lunch and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"NY style is my favorite type of pizza, but this place was disappointing. Fine if you are in a hurry and in the area, but I don't recommend going out of your way for this pizza."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Charlotte! From Charlotte to Mooresville for that matter! Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome NY style pizza, great tasting sauce and just enough of it, and good quality cheese (not the rubbery stuff).  Slices big enough you need to fold--perfect!  Salad was nice too, very generous amounts of meat and cheese, and presented nicely.  Will go back next time we are in Charlotte"}
{"text":"HUGE, delicious slices! The cannoli is great too! Only thing I would recommend is a shaker with garlic powder, but outside of that I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I didn't get the pizza, I got a cheese steak (i refuse to call anything not from George's in Philly a \"philly cheese steak).  The bread was soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside.  it's a pretty decent cheese steak.  I've had their pizza before and the slices are huge."}
{"text":"Good food, quality is excellent. I am a road warrior and appreciate hot food delivered in a reasonable time. These folks always beat the promise time"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing the hype about Luigi's for sometime and finally succumbed and checked it out. I've passed it plenty of times but establishments were the windows are so dark you can't see in have always skeeved me out. But the other night, I was on a mission for good quality NY style pizza and Luigi's came to mind. There was not a single person in there on a Wednesday night which I found a bit odd. This is the place that everyone has been telling me about yes? Regardless, I ordered a small pepperoni pizza to go and went to go get my Teet on next store while they made it. They made it in record time and when they handed me the box, I was shocked at how huge it was! The small pizza is huge and seeing that it's just me, this was going to last me for three to four meals for the next few days.

 The pizza was just as I expected---cheesy, yummy goodness that I had to fold in half just to eat with just the right amount of grease. I will definitely be going back to Luigi's when I am jonesing for a slice or a pie that will last me for days on end. I kinda want to walk in there decked out in Red Sox or Patriots gear just to get a reaction!"}
{"text":"A solid slice for Charlotte, definitely one of the better places in the city. The hero's are great as well. This is a good stop gap in between visits back home to New York. There is no reason to go to Fuel with Luigi's around

{"text":"This rating is a very sad but true reflection of the most recent experience at Luigis..my son absolutely LOVES Luigis Pizza..it is our tradition to stop in after many of his Saturday sporting events..we came in on Sat early eve..ordered our usual XL Single slice of pizza..was the place busy..well as it always is but a bit less than normal for Saturday..I picked up the order and took it to our table..I noticed a black crusting at the side and flipped part of pizza over to a completely black and burnt crust that was hard and not eatable..I took it back up and told them disappointment and we would like it redone..NO ONE spoke to me other than a man in the background with glasses that started hand gestures to me and cursing me in Italian...oops some people in America know other languages..my son witnessed the whole thing..food was remade and sat on counter for me to pickup after called name..when I went to pick it up the staff turned around and walked away..NOT 1 single apology or any kind of customer service..totally UNACCEPTABLE LUIGIS..and we are regulars...well we were..good luck on your visit there!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Big ol slices of NY style. Price wasn't too bad. The pizza is all I've had here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The slices here are New York style...huge! Hard to eat more than one. Came in hear for a late lunch and the place was empty. No worries, I grabbed a seat at the bar after I ordered I was content. If you want a slice they have cheese and pepporoni pre-made and you can get additional toppings for a small charge. I went with the cheese, then added sausage and mushroom. Came out after about 5 minutes. Looked great except for the canned mushrooms. Why can't pizza joints use real mushrooms. It would add so much to us mushroom lovers. Flavor was good and it's worth another try...just not with mushrooms this time.

They also have regular pasta dishes and sandwiches if pizza's not you thing."}
{"text":"Came in last night I was craving something quick and good and thats what they offer with their Ginormous slices!! So good still, I had a slice and a half with a garden salad that was piled up so high with mozzarella YUM! It really does resemble a NY pizza place so that's why I enjoy it so much!"}
{"text":"I placed a 40.00 order and while I was waiting, I asked for one of their cheap dixie cups to get some water from the soda fountain.  I was told \"that will be .30 cent\".  At first I thought it was a joke and the counter girl told me \"the owner charges for everything\".  

That is my last visit to this restaurant.   I work for a major chemical company and we supply many restaurants. I know the service industry very well. 

Greed is a terrible thing when you serve the public."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of NY-style pizza usually but I must say that I'm impressed with Luigi's.  The crust was thin but had a good bite to it.  The cheeses / sauce ratio was just right and the toppings were seasoned well and was plentiful.

The slices are pretty big.  I would say 1 - 2 slices should be plenty of most people."}
{"text":"I remember when Luigi's first opened. It was, hands down, the best pizza in town. Over time, the taste and quality has changed. The sauce has a lot mess taste and the texture of the crust has changed to a thinner cheaper tasting ingredient. 

For the size slice, the price is decent. But, I sure do miss those early days when the slices were superb!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, thin, cheesy pizza. Best in the area so far, the only downside is no delivery."}
{"text":"I can't believe I had not reviewed this place before!

I totally 100% agree with the previous reviews this is by far the BEST New York style pizza in town! 

It's thin, greasy, and just delicious! The slices are HUGE...so you don't have to worry about leaving hungry, they offer cheese and pepperoni, but if you want something else....no problem, just let them know and they will throw it on there for you! 

If pizza is not your thing, the chicken wings are delicious! It's crispy and the breading is outstanding! The subs are great too, my favorite is the Italian, loaded with fresh topping and served hot. 

Everyone is always nice, and the service is very fast! It's definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Average to slightly below average pizza.  Very little cheese.  Sauce was uninspiring.  That said, $2.50 for a *huge* slice is a good deal.  The service was very warm and friendly, too, hence the three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"After along and hot as hell day with family at Carowinds we were staving. I was ready to eat road kill along side road; like a faded memory I recalled Luigi's Pizza. As we pulled up I felt like I dream; 1940's New York City and I was getting ready to be shipped off to Great War.  
Ok, now the pizza, it was best thin crest pizza I ever had. The cheese and pepperoni was to die for. My daughter wanted  spaghetti and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pizza I've had. Their salads and other dishes are great, too. Always friendly service!"}
{"text":"Average pizza based on my first trip. I will try them again now that I know what to order. 

Great crust, which met my expectations but the toppings were surprisingly awful. Bland sausage, canned mushrooms, spinach that came from the frozen chopped block (I was expecting spinach leaves), and garlic from a jar. 

Also I wouldn't recommend the pizza by he slice except maybe for lunch. The pizza just isn't the same when it's pre-made. 

I saw someone's freshly made pepperoni pizza come straight out from the oven and it looked like a phenomenal NY/Brooklyn pie. I'll go that route next time."}
{"text":"Yummy thin pizza by the slice!  We were going to the movies tonight and we had an hour to kill so I gave my husband a choice of pizza  or cocktail.  Do you know how good this pizza must be???  Not much on atmosphere but a great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Closest thing to a true NYC pizza! Great staff and great food! Can't ask for anything else."}
{"text":"I'm just shocked that I was one of the only people in here eating lunch....finally a really really good pizza place.  Just the kind of pizza I like huge, greasy, cheesy, delicious.  Also had a side salad to justify that huge piece of pizza I was about to devour...everything was fresh the guys behind the counter were friendly  - and it was a great place overall for a cheap lunch.  I'll be back hopefully picking up a whole pizza to take home with me - that could be dangerous."}
{"text":"So this place is very GOOD! They have the best garlic knots I have ever had in my life!  Plus their subs and stromboli is great too!  Would definetly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'm from New Jersey and this definitely reminds me of NY style pizza. Huge slices of pizza with tangy tomato sauce and melty cheese and a thin hot crust. If you like garlic I suggest getting fresh garlic as a topping. I love this pizza and the Cheesesteaks are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone has their particulars about pizza, but we just moved from NYC and Luigi's is literally a 'LARGE' slice of home for us. 

We ordered two basic slices - cheese and pepperoni and they hit the mark. Thin, crispy base and the crust was perfection. The folks behind the counter were very friendly and the crowd was down to earth. While my husband's homemade pizza is still number one in my books, we can't wait to revisit this little joint again, it's the best NYC style Pizza in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I had a Philly Cheesesteak from here last night and the steak tasted bad and old. My sons kept telling me this place had good sandwiches. I had the bread which was pretty good with waffle fries for dinner last night. Woke up this morning and threw the remaining half of the sandwich away and it smelled bad. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Thin crust...nice and crispy!  Walk-up counter, order by the slice or a whole pie!  Also have Sicilian pies and other Italian dishes."}
{"text":"The closest thing to delicious, NY style pizza in Charlotte!!  Love the Giants memorabilia in here, too!! Worth the trip across town :)"}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in our area. The only improvement I can suggest is their forks and knives really stink. The pizza melts the gangs of the forks and you cannot cut the pizza without sawing a lot. Best to eat it there but it reheats well too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from New Jersey, and I was really missing home and New York style pizza. I love about a mile away from Luigi's pizza and I heard good things about them so i decided to try it out!! I do NOT regret my decision!! This was the closest I've tasted to NYC style pizza since I've moved here!! The slices were HUGE as well!! I got a slice with sliced sausage (the only pizzeria down here who does sliced sausage) and broccoli and my boyfriend got a pepperoni slice. We also got an order of garlic knots, which were just ok, a little too oily for me. My boyfriend loved them, but that was his first time ever having knots so he had nothing to compare them to. Even the atmosphere was New York style with the man in the back twirling pizza dough in the air!! If you're looking for a good, hot, large slice of pizza, Luigi's is the way to go!!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach and cheese calzone. 
It was good except for the drop that fell on my shirt.
The pizza looked very good.
The garlic knots looked awesome all bathing in the garlic and butter. 
Someone had a cheese steak and he said he always gets them here. Looked very good. 
I will return if in the area."}
{"text":"Best cheese steak I have ever ate! Want to try pizza next. Will be going back to this place. Authentic. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"A lot of my coworkers really enjoy the NY style pizza and I will admit, it's pretty good.  I ventured off the main path and ordered the lasagna. I should have followed the crowd.  Their photo of the lasagna was everything I would want, multiple layers of melted cheese, seasoned meat, dripping with sauce...  what I got was the worst kind of dissapointment.  I took 2 bites and that was more than enough.  Luckily the meal came with garlic knots so I wasn't starving.  My surprise came when I took the lasagna with 2 bites missing back to the counter.  I told them this was not at all what I was expecting.   The guys response, \"sorry\".  

That was the last time I will eat at Luigi's."}
{"text":"A slice of pizza was bigger than my head! When I think of a pizza joint, Luigi's is exactly what I imagine. 

You walk up to order and they have everything from slices to whole regular or Sicilian pizzas, hot sandwiches, pasta or other Italian specialties, salads, and a bunch of appetizers. You can get a variety of beers in a bottle or on tap. They also have 3 big screen tvs so you can always keep an eye out on your favorite sporting event. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. For instance, a couple entered and didn't want to watch football, so they asked to change the channel to basketball and they got their request without hesitation and with a smile. Great customer service! 

This location draws a friendly crowd and brings families together. It was pretty steady on a Sunday night, but still never overcrowded. It looks like that they will have a patio section when it gets warmer. The place was clean, efficient, and an overall great atmosphere. The staff always seemed on the go and happy to be there. 

One slice of cheese pizza was plenty. I also ordered a side salad (tip - if you do not like onions, make sure you request no onions. I forgot and those little buggers were all over the salad. They definitely pile them on). My husband ordered the spaghetti and it was great. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I work in Ayrsley and occasionally the office orders pizza. This is the offices first choice if they can get it. We have some folks from NY and they are very touchy about pizza. It's NY style or bust and this place passes muster. For myself I really like their pizza. It's not too greasy like some other nearby places when it comes to their slices. I will say though I don't like their Sicilian pizza at all. It's really dry and doughy and just not to my taste. The fried ravioli was really good the one time I tried it out. So if you're looking for NY style pizza in the Ayrsley area head over to Luigi's!!"}
{"text":"I'm NY born and raised, so my pizza expectations are very high. Luigis is by far the best pizza in town. Huge slices, great flavor, perfect thin crusts. It brings a bit of home to the Carolina's."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty dang solid.  Another place that gets the Northeastern star of approval for pizza down here. I will def be back to try what else they have to offer"}
{"text":"By far the best NY style pizza I've had in Charlotte! The hot sandwiches are good too. Nothing else has come close. I am glad that I found Luigi's."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, but prices are ridiculous! I ordered a veggie pizza not realizing that it was going to cost $1.45 for each veggie of their choosing.  So it was a 16\" with onions $1.45, mushrooms $1.45, black olives $1.45 and green peppers $1.45, seriously, those are inexpensive veggies $1.45 each? I think that's a bit crazy! Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Recommended by friends who are recent transplants from NYC and they said that was the closest to NY style they have been able to find.  I have to agree this is arguably the best slice in Charlotte.  Crust is phenomenal. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Luigi's Pizza is decent but far from the best.  There are some issues I have with it.  First, the slices are too thin, even by \"NYC style\" standards.  They may have large pies, but they really aren't that big going by weight.  I've been to NYC and had pizza at different places, and it's all thicker than Luigi's.  Next is the lack of cheee - it's a pretty thin layer that usually doesn't completely cover the sauce.  The next issue is that the sauce could be a little better altough it is ok.  The last issue, and the one I really have a problem with, is the slimy, cheap canned mushrooms.  They are disgusting.  If franchise pizza places can use fresh mushrooms, then Luigi's can too.  So Luigi's pizza is ok, but far from the perfect and far from the best in Charlotte.  I will take Libretto;s any day over it."}
{"text":"Pizza slices as big as your face!! No joke. Had the chicken parm sub and a slice of pepperoni and sausage. I was really impressed with both. The pizza slice came out perfectly crisp and the sausage was excellent. It had a nice bite of fennel to it. The chicken parm sub was good but could have used a little more sauce."}
{"text":"The menu says 18 inch pizza is 14.99 and each topping 1.75 each.   So they tell me a 2 topping 18 inch pizza is $23 dollars 

This place is a rip off. Don't go and if you do. Get a break down of the bill"}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza. Huge slices, huge salads but not huge prices! Plus any place that has NY Giants memorabilia on the walls is okay in my book!! I am curious to try some of their other stuff, like anything parmigiana or pastas. But I am always weary of those things because the sauce always ends up disappointing.  So for now I will stick with the delicious, super thin crust pizza!!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  I have been here for lunch a few times and each time the pizza was so greasy that the cheese slides off the slice of pizza.  I always fold my pizza in half to eat it and each time the sauce was greasy and the cheese came off.  The slices are huge, but I don't plan to go back for pizza."}
{"text":"This is a really good New York Style Pie.  Their crust needs a bit more salt and probably more time to develop but the texture was spot on.  Really nice tomato sauce and good cheese.  The pizza filled the box and then some.  I'm always trying to find the absolute best pizzas in the Charlotte area.  For a stone cooked New York style pie I place this pizza up there with just a few others doing this style really well in this area."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever in Charlotte!!!! Calzones are amazing, sandwiches are great! We eat there twice a month. Prices are very reasonable. I would rather drive there and pick up our order and bring it home than order a delivered pizza. Any large delivery pizza is smaller and costs more than a small pizza from Louigis. Seriously $12.00 for a 16\" pie ! Their sizes are 16\",18\" & 20\". And they even have a jumbo! If you order by the slice you won't be disappointed. $2.50 a slice. And they are jumbo slices, HUGE!!! Great place for a quick lunch, or a Friday pizza night with the family. You can stand at the window and watch your pizza being tossed in the air and prepared while you wait,( a favorite of my son). Only thing that would make it better would be if the restaurant was a little bigger. I've had to eat in my car a few times during lunch because of how crowded it was. But still very worth it !"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Luigis's Pizza since they opened their doors.  They absolutely have the best pizza anywhere in the area."}
{"text":"NY style pizza - done right. Simple, inexpensive and just how pizza was meant to be. Nice staff and great food all around. For me - standard slice of cheese. Less than $5 for my typical simple lunch"}
{"text":"Delicious NY pizza!  Cannolis are a can't miss!  I would just get it to go, unless you just want a hard booth with nothing fancy."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to Luigi's Pizza, all I can say is wow!  The slices of pizza are HUGE and very yummy!  I wish I worked closer so I could go there every day for lunch, it's that good!"}
{"text":"We order an 18\" regular (thin crust) and a Sicilian, both with 2 toppings and it was $44 with a $4 coupon.  Ouch.  Both had very little, flavorless sauce.  The Sicilian was 3/4\" of white bread with scant toppings.  Unimpressed.  I've had good NY pizza in NY and this is not it."}
{"text":"It's a me a Mario!!  This is the best pizza I have had in Charlotte!  It's authentic NY pizza.  Some friends brought over a pie a few weeks ago and I pretty much ate the entire thing.  I have had a hard time finding good Italian food here in Charlotte being from upstate New York, but Luigi's hit the spot!  Grazie mille!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Brooklyn pizza in the area. Can't understand why anybody would go to a chain when they can support local.

Service can be a little spotty when the boss isn't there, and the strip shopping center ambiance leaves a little to be desired.

If the cops eat there, that says a lot."}
{"text":"Great place pizzas are massive, perhaps a limited selection of pizzas, of course you can build your own but would be good to have meat, veggie, options"}
{"text":"Get the pizza by the slice, it's quick , easy and pretty delicious as long as it's been heated up long enough. I love the fact that it's usually pretty crispy enough to wear it doesn't go limp when you pick it up (get your mind out of the gutter). The pies aren't really worth it, they end up being pretty expensive when you add on toppings of your choice. I'm just glad they got rid of their previous female employee that worked the counter..she was obnoxious and so rude. The people working there are almost all hispanic but who cares, the slices are good!"}
{"text":"Great service! I had a slice of pizza and a salad for six bucks, my pizza slice was huge! I mean like it could cover my face! That's a great size for price. The menu is pretty big so you should be able to find what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"Good all the way to the crust!!! I'm always skeptical when NY style pizza is advertised but I must say it's was delicious and authentic. Wonderful sized slices I could have had only one, but I had two!! I've had fuel, pizza peel, and mama's pizza and his beats them hands down! Probably the best in charlotte."}
{"text":"ate here about a week ago.  pizza was good and service was fast.  I order 2 slices and almost didn't finish them.  I would come here again"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but awesome Philly cheesesteaks!  Kinda small place so it gets crowded when busy.  I would check it out if in area."}
{"text":"If you're missing New York Style Pizza, then head over to Luigi's Pizza.  Having lived in NYC for 10 years, this place definitely reminded me of NYC. 

I ordered the Mushroom slice and a coworker ordered Buffalo Chicken.  The slices were fairly large in portion size. 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Nice little pizza joint.  Pizza sizes are 16 18 or 20.  They offer pizza by the slice. Seem to be mostly a take out location but do have tables.  Crust was great, topings were good, cheese is just ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for NY style pizza in town.  Been living here all my life and just tried it a couple weeks ago... Two days in a row it was so good lol.  If you are the type to complain about \"greasy\" pizza, this place ain't for you.  I mean really what you expect cheese to do when it melts?? But anyways, try this place out if you like real NY style pies!"}
{"text":"I've never been to New York, but I've got to believe this is the closest thing to authentic NY pizza you're going to find this far south. Giant slices! If you're going for lunch, plan on take out. The place isn't very big and the seats fill up quickly!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Charlotte for New York pizza. Hands down. Reading some of these reviews.... if you don't like New York pizza, don't go on Yelp to complain that you wanted/expected something else!

Anywho.....

The slices are huge! They are the biggest I've seen in Charlotte. One slice alone usually fills me up just fine.

The joint is small. I've never had any problems with crowds or wait time, but I haven't been there at peak lunch hour either.

I wish this was a little closer to my place (branch out some new locations!) but if I ever find myself in the Steele Creek area, you know for sure I'm going here."}
{"text":"Best NY pizza in town..hands down! I've been eating here and the steelecroft location for years, and I have never had a bad experience.  The staff and owners are very friendly (yes the owners are usually there everyday), food is always great and reasonably priced.  This place gets crowded at lunch time especially during Mon-Fri business hours.  If your a New Yorker (like me) and looking for a good slice, you must check Luigi's out!!"}
{"text":"It is probably the best NY pizza I ever had in the Charlotte area. The first time I tried I was overwhelmed by the size of the slices. The ingredients are fresh. My family and I love to have pizza once a week if possible. I only wish they could deliver as well or perhaps open a new store in Pineville. 

My coworkers also love this place. It's great for a movie night with the family or friends."}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation by a security guard where we were on business for 2 weeks.  A security guard from NYC so I had high hopes!  I was not leat down in the least!   This pizza is top notch!  The rule was no repeat restaurants while in Charlotte but this place deserved a repeat.  In fact i thought about it every day. The slices are huge and a bang for the buck!  But we still managed to get 2 down each.  1 plain and 1 roni.   I wish there was one closer to us!    This pizza is one  of the best i have ever had. Right up there with Lorenzo's on South St in Philly! 
Wish I got to try the cheese steak.   The owner states its' as good as Philly!"}
{"text":"When we do get pizza it's here... The staff are fast and friendly and the kids love it ... We don't eat a lot of pizza but when we do its \"Luigis\""}
{"text":"Not much to say here other than it's a middle of the road pizza joint.  It's certainly NY style in its large slices and thin foldable crust, however the crust is just average at best!  The mozzarella cheese is a very good quality, and the meatballs that I got as the topping were fantastic as well!  Other than that, there wasn't a outstanding reason for me to return!"}
{"text":"Coming from  a Long Island native, Luigi's is the best pizza in Charlotte.  Good crust, good sauce, huge slices, and prices you would expect to pay in any NY pizza place.  One of the few places around here you can get a Sicilian pie and veal parm.  Been going here for years and look forward to going for many more."}
{"text":"Good food and normally that would earn high marks from me.  However, for people me size the booths are just too small."}
{"text":"We bought a 20\" pepperoni and it was phenomenal! Our first time eating at Luigi's, as we were in the area for my birthday, and we will definitely come back in the future! Pizza was hot and tasty despite the drive to get it back to the hotel and tasted exactly the same the next afternoon warmed in the microwave! Completely in love with Luigi's! Thank you for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"Best NY Style Pizza in Charlotte. Need I say more. Great price, great service. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I've had NYC Pizza in NYC and this was as close to it as I have ever found in the south Servers were awesome food was fresh and decently priced."}
{"text":"If this is great New York Pizza I'm not that impressed
no doubt its got a lot of things going for it 
1. its huge
2. lots of toppings on the combo
3. it does have flavor
Bad things 
1. kinda drippy
2. very thin crust
3. the store itself is kinda \"cheesy\"

big menu lots of things I would have liked to try
its a pretty good pizza"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte! 

If you're craving real NY style pizza this is your place! The inside of it even reminds me of a NY pizzeria,  limited tables and space. It's usually crowded during lunch. It's definitely a good idea to call your order in whether it be lunch or not because they usually make the pizza to order. Unless, you're getting a single slice which they still heat up in the oven. Do yourselves a favor a head over to Luigi's next time you're craving pizza."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  The problem is lunch hours get so jam packed that you have to wait 15 minutes for a table after you order.  People are hawking tables and staring at people to finish up and leave.  

But enough about the annoying customers.  The pizza is great - good sauce, good dough and just the right amount of toppings.  And the slices are huge!

Like Julia, I miss the Dilworth store but at least I work near this one so I can get it once in a while."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest pizza fan, so my review is a little biased because of this. But Luigi's still wouldn't impress me even if I loved pizza. It's located in a shopping center & isn't that large of a place. You can get a slice pretty quickly, so if you're in a hurry it's not a bad choice. To me, the pizza tastes just like any other average pizza chain pizza. It's a thin crust type of pizza that I just really don't care for.

Everyone in here is very nice & the service is great, something you won't find at your chain pizza joints. The inside seating reminds me of a cafeteria, but you can usually find a seat for you & a couple friends.

Don't let my biasness of pizza influence you too much, but if you don't prefer the thin crust, average slice of pizza, then there's no need to try out Luigi's. But if you like NY style, then this place must be doing something right, because everyone who's reviewed it has loved this place & its pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I just started working over here and I'm hooked. So far I've only had a few items here but I love it. 
I've ordered pizza here and the sizes seemed confusing but it's huge! The smallest pizza they have is 16' which is basically the Large everywhere else. The pizza is simple and great. 
I also order d the Stromboli. It's probably one of the best I've had anywhere. It comes with cheese, sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms. Its pretty inexpensive and huge! It's hard to finish the whole thing. 

I will continue coming here and bring other people with me."}
{"text":"I need to get to Luigi's to try some pizza but I am kind of hooked on their chicken parmesan sub...

Why it's a damn good parm sub: 

1) It has the perfect amount of sauce:  it's flavorful and plentiful but doesn't turn the bread into a soggy sad mess.
2) Speaking of bread, it's toasted perfectly: The  corners of your mouth do not feel like they had a date with a hack saw.
3) Hey there's chicken in there- and guess what it tastes like chicken: No rib meat or bright pink mash-up they serve at other places. 
4) The cheese oozes - you guessed it, perfectly. No oil slick flavor in the mouth but enough ooey gooey goodness to set your gym bells ringing. 

As soon as I can pull myself away from the deliciousness that is that sub I will surely try their pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza slices are huge!! I've had pepperoni, mushroom, ham, beef and sausage and they are all good. Sauce is so tasty. Not watery. And lots of flavor. Wings are good too. Nice and crispy and worth the wait. Hot and spicy! My favorite part about the slices of pizza is that it's not too crispy. I know some people like that but I don't. It's just right. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Same great pizza as the spot in Steele Creek. I'm glad they are consistent with each other. Love there pizza, wings and subs."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of this place when it was recommended to me. It didn't look like much from the outside and didn't look like much from the inside. Even seeing the pizza all I could think was, okay its big. Doesn't make it good.

But its good. Maybe one of my top 5 favortie pizzas ever. I don't really like pizza, but I can't stop thinking about this place. Its going to be a once a week ordeal now."}
{"text":"I was with Nicole B on the business trip.  This pizza was literally the most fantastic pizza I have ever tasted.  The slices were so huge, I really can't explain how we managed to eat 2 of them.  We just wanted to nap afterward!  We broke our no repeat rule to go back the following week, and swore we would not eat 2, but we just couldn't do it!  We HAD to eat 2 more!  The 3rd party in our group only had 1 slice but there were probably 7 lbs of toppings on it. I would drive back to Charlotte just to get that pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with mixed feelings. The first was the regular pizza which was not bad. Most recently we tried the Sicilian/deep crust pizza and couldn't finish it. As we got the smallest size, the 16, we are probably going to throw out most of it. The crust is not pizza dough, it's like bad white bread. If you want a regular slice of pizza, go for it. If you want thick crust go somewhere else."}
{"text":"NY style pizza, very well priced. Got half cheese, half pepperoni. Just the right amount of greasy. The staff didn't seem to happy to be there, but I don't blame them. The store was easy to find (out of towner, here) with convenient parking. Will definitely visit again the next time we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Picture this...a hungry lady sits at home waiting for her husband to bring home a delicious pizza from Luigi's. Little did she know how massive the 20\" pie was in real life...

Holy pizza pie! Now, I'm a big proponent of pizza leftovers but this was bordering on ridiculous. But I liked it. We ordered a 20\" pie with cheese, fresh tomatoes and green peppers. This mammoth only cost us about $17-$18 with tax! The most hilarious thing is that this gargantuan pie was cut into only 8 slices. Hahahah! Slices larger than my head!

I got through a slice and a half and I was well on my way to a 'za coma. The pizza was cheesy, not too floppy with a substantial crispy crust. This thin crust giant will most certainly be dined upon for the next few days. Naturally, I will absolutely be back for another huge pie in the semi-near future. Compared to the pizza chains, Luigi's is a slam dunk in size, quality and overall affordability. Plus, it only took them 15 minutes to whip up our take out order! 

My recommendation? Fold your slices, people, fold 'em and stuff 'em."}
{"text":"Pizza was greasy, but the yummy kind of greasy.  Possibly the best pizza in the area.  We fed a small army on a tight budget.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend who had a really nice lunch there. However, we tried the calzones at dinner time. It was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten. I cut it open, which was difficult because it was mostly burnt, with a plastic knife and fork,  and there was the largest amount of cheese I have ever seen. There were about 4 slices of the cheapest ham lunch meat sliced up inside. The lunch meat was slimed and rubbery, all at the same time. The sauce tasted nice, but it was so thin you could drink it easier than dip it. I hate to mention the doughy garlic knots, because I wanted to like something, but I had to think \"mind over matter\" to continue to swallow them. The drink machine needed syrup, and the tea tasted like nothing at all. The radio playing above our heads was just super loud static. And finally, it cost $30 for 2 people, that makes it so much more disappointing. I am new to Charlotte and have been looking for a nice pizza place, guess I'll keep looking !"}
{"text":"Cute, relaxing, free WiFi, and has an amazingly huge calzone!!  (They actually warned me as I was ordering it.)  The workers and owners were just down right fun and you could tell they love what they're doing.  

The calzone was amazing!  Perfect crust and OVER stuffed with meats, cheeses, and veggies.  If you're hungry and you want quality ... Luigi's delivers.  

I got to get back in to try the pizza ....."}
{"text":"This place has a great lunch slice of pizza! Would have got 5 stars but no napkins, no Cheese Shakers On Tables, needs a good cleaning. Clean but not spotless. The help is why I am giving 4 stars. If you want a group of employee's that want to make your lunch great, eat here every day! The guy taking your order, the guy making pies, all of the employee's here are awesome! I will be going here every time in the area! Best pizza in South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and was totally dissatisfied and couldn't even finish it - It cost $12 they threw it in a tin - with 2 tiny meatballs that I would have sworn were store brought - It was cold and you can tell it was sitting around and NOT FRESH - A total waste of my time and money - They are known for there Pizza which Ive had in the past, my husband ordered 2 huge slices tonight and they were cold and old - A true disgrace to Italian Food sorry to say....Get it together! Especially when your serving people from NY and NJ who know good authentic Italian Food."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 
Long time no type!!

Short review. My wife was out grabbing groceries & decided 2 order out. She arrived home with a back seat full of groceries and....... A BIG brown pizza box. \"Surprise\"


Opened the box and found a REAL NY style pepperoni & sausage pizza (she said it was about 15 bucks. 

\"I figured you would like this pizza. It's the kind u can fold like u like to RIGHT\"?  Yes indeedy sweety. 

Nice big slices. Not shabby on the toppings. Will definitely go again... And again... And again.

TTFN"}
{"text":"So far this is my fav pizza joint in town! Best NY style pizza in Charlotte. My fav: meatballs, onions, and tomatoes. The hubs sticks with the traditional pepperoni which he raves about. The fried raviolis are pretty delish too as an appetizer! Great pizza and always fast, friendly service. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"The crust has a nice texture, but very little flavor, the pepperoni and cheese were very good, it was cooked well, nice and crisp on the bottom but fold-able like NY pizza should be. My biggest gripe is the dining room. My wife and I went in to order a whole pizza, we were going to eat a slice or two and take the rest home. Well, I am a big guy and I wouldn't fit in the booths. They only have those cheap Formica table/booths with everything anchored to the floor, nothing is moveable except for two chairs that if you sat in you would literally be sitting halfway in the door. So we got a slice each and sat in the car and ate it. It's a shame because the Dilworth location had normal tables and chairs. I would give them a 3 1/2 for pizza but a 1 for the dining room, so I averaged it to 2 stars. Get smart Luigi and get some tables and chairs. I won't be back until you do."}
{"text":"I can't believe Luigi's is out of business. This was my favorite delivery place and it's closure has left a void which cannot be filled. 

In my opinion, dollar for dollar, this was the best New York style delivery place in my area. Other dishes were also good. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say something about my old friend in case someone else decides to reopen it."}
{"text":"God I miss the Dilworth outpost. Really, really miss it.

First thing I asked when walking in - you guys are reopening in CLT proper, right? When? Where?

Girl gives me a sad face, shakes her head. I drown my sorrows in two slices (that's right mofos - 2). Then almost doze off twice driving back to town, all pizza-hazed.

Sigh."}
{"text":"Key elements present:

Undercrust charred in spots, appx. 50% burn coverage: check
Chewy crust, lots of air pockets: check
Incredibly thin, floppy crust, still structurally stable: check
Salty, greasy, lumpy cheese that cannot possibly be referred to as Mozz but who cares: check
Microthin sauce coating, tart, tangy, slight herbiness: check
Consistency: check
Cheap: check

They've either honed in on the Perfect Slice or I've been away from NY too long. Thank Mary they don't deliver. (I only kinda mean that).

We'll miss you, Luigi! Let your loving, drooling customers know where you go so we can follow you into the greasy, salty, foldy, awesome sunset."}
{"text":"New York style Pizza at it's best. The calzones are great too. Great for Lunch or dinner for the family or if you want a great pizza."}
{"text":"This is one of the top pizza places in Charlotte. I lived right outside of New York and Luigi's could pass as a great New York pie. The crust was crispy, the cheese melts in your mouth and toppings were delicious. I highly recommend anybody looking for a great New York pie to visit Luigi's."}
{"text":"When I came here.... I was expected to be blown away.  This greasy pizza was not all of that.  It was good to try out a new spot, but if you are in the mood for pizza, then you should go to House of Pizza.  That's more up to New York's standard for pizza.  Or you should try Portfonios.   I'm just saying...."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why people go crazy over Luigi's Pizza.  Both locations are about the same in size and quality.  I heard so many great things about the pizza I thought it was going to be amazing.  It was OK.  

I've only had the pizza, so maybe I need to try a sandwich or something else but they've been voted best pizza.  The mushrooms were canned, not fresh and the sauce I asked for on the side for dipping had a different taste to it, maybe like it had chicken broth in it?  Maybe not, I just expected much better.  

When asked why they don't deliver, they say \"we don't have to\".  I don't plan to go out of my way to get pizza there...."}
{"text":"Okay... I'ma tell you why it's three stars, considering the pizza was actually pretty good... 

I went in a little while ago to pick up a quick slice because I've been running around today and didn't have time to eat...  I noticed all these awesome reviews and figured I'd give it a try... As soon as I walked in, I was greeted warmly and assisted... I ordered a slice of pepperoni to go since it was close to closing...

I was super excited when the guy pulled my pizza out of the oven... It was a huge slice and it looked great!  But here's my question:  What happens when you get actual NY pizza to go? Do they just take the paper plate it's on, fold it in half and shove it directly into a paper bag with no cover, container or anything?  Not trying to be funny, that's an actual question... Because if the answer to that is yes, then they are truly authentic...  Otherwise, what in the world is that about? lol

Look, I promise I am not a cray cray germaphobe or anything (regardless of what the boyfriend says), but look here... The dude shoving my pizza in the paper bag?  He used his BARE HAND to fold the tip of my pizza and my crust in place to fit inside said paper bag... Oh, sweetness... Nooooooooo... I'm sure he's an awesome guy... He was really nice to me and all...  But if you're working the front line that close to closing, you are very likely touching waaaaay more than just food and now you're going to stick your hand on the top and bottom of my food?  Ick.  Seriously... 

After I took the tip of my pizza off, the rest of the slice was awesome... Truly... I definitely am a fan and I'll be back... But next time, I will be dining in... lol"}
{"text":"Good as it gets for price AND NY style pizza in Charlotte.  

Libretto's in uptown is at the top of my list too for NY style pizza, but costs twice as much.  
If both places had the same price and location, I'd get Libretto's - but Luigi's gives a better bargain and more of the NY pizzeria feel.  Seriously big slices!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Charlotte! Owners are from Brooklyn and they know what they're doing.  I had the pizza, chicken parm, huge salad and cheesteak so far and it was awesome!  Big portions too. Definitely a must."}
{"text":"Huge slices and a great deal for lunch. The people are nice but let's face it, the pizza is nothing special. The subs are good but no meal deal with chips or drink."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Charlotte. I have been eating here for 7 years (give or take) and its always delishious. The pizza slices are huge and a great deal at around $2.50. Crust is always nice and crunch, sauce has excellent flavor and there is just enough cheese on it. The place is on the smaller side and they do get busy for lunch so there is a chance you wont get a seat... you can order out but not slices. If my some miracle I have leftover pizza from here its even better later cold :-) or for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Updating one of my first Charlotte Yelp reviews because Luigi's is still the best New York style pizza in the Charlotte area. Huge slices that are bigger than a standard paper plate, served fresh and hot. Yep, they have other great stuff too. I've bought home a massive calzone (spinach? yes, please) that my wife really enjoyed. As well, their chicken cordon bleu sandwich hits the spot.

But for me, it's the 'za and Luigi's sells it in massive pies or by the slice. Get some!

Note that there are now TWO Luigi's outlets in the area. This one is in the Wal-Mart shopping center. The other one is down in Steele Creek near Target."}
{"text":"This is a great place for take out, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is excellent, and I echo Dave S.'s sentiment about the size of the slices (although I did not try the pizza).

The downside, is the dinning area is small and they have crammed way too many tables in a small space, so unless you want to have a stranger sit on your lap I would get the food to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent! 

Like I said in my previous review, I want to give any restaurant I've enjoyed over the years the benefit of the doubt if quality turns south. Maybe someone there was listening.

Thought I'd give Luigi's and their stromboli (with peppers and onions) another try since it's been several months since the last. This time no raw uncooked bell peppers. That was one more good stromboli! The crust was cooked to perfection!

I hope the owners continue to strive to keep the quality up where their customers expect it to be."}
{"text":"Had their delicious NY Style Pizza delivered to my hotel along with some lasagna, all in all everything was very good and the delivery to my room was within 30 minutes. Next time I am in town I will order from them again."}
{"text":"So I just came back from NY and Philly and I can honestly say that umm...while Luigis gets honorable mention for effort, pizza is nothing like the pizza I had in NY. NY pizza crust, wow. Crisp, light, airy, damn it just can't be replicated. 

And the cheesesteak, was nothing like Pats, King of Cheesesteaks. Buuuuut, I like Luigi's cheesesteaks more! Pat's slices of beef are thick, and chewy - Too chewy for me. Luigis also uses better bread =)


1up for Luigis!"}
{"text":"Very good New York still pizza with fresh ingredients. If you need a break from delivery pizza, this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Being that I've moved here recently from NY, It's nice to find pizza that compares to back home. Nice thin crust, tasty cheese and the good kind of grease. Love it! And the wings are delicious too"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in town that I've found.

Let's keep this short and sweet.   If you know and love NY pizza you will not want to wait any longer than necessary to get some of this pie.

If you like crappy pizza with weird toppings go to California Pizza Kitchen, for me, keep it real, keep it simple, nothing beats a NY slice w/ pepperoni and extra cheese.

To put it simply I'm not ordering pizza from anywhere else.  

The first time I bit into one of their pies I simultaneously began crying and laughing. True Story.

Priced as it should be, I would even pay a bit more, but don't tell them that.  As for the service - they do their job, they take pizza orders and place the order quickly, you sit down and eat, or take it with you, I don't need my hand held at a pizza place, this is not my first rodeo.

If you are still reading this review you have wasted way too much valuable pizza-eating time.

Over and out."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I have never had a slice from this place!! 

Now, I admit I was skeptical because there are a lot of places out there that claim to have \"NY  Style Pizza\" and I've been disappointed before, but this place was good to my tummy. 

The prices by the slice are pretty reasonable since the slices are so large. I was full after having only 1 slice of cheese pizza. Also, I ordered and received my food in 7 minutes during the lunch rush (yes, I timed it)! 

Definitely coming back for another lunch visit!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and have had Luigi's on my bookmark list for a LONG time and it was lunch time so....  Two slices and a drink please!

About the slices.  Perhaps the thinnest crust I have ever had on a pizza with a fantastic crunch and nice chew.  Perfect?  Maybe not but darn close.  The rest of the two cheese slices were pretty basic with nothing special to write about but, the crust made the whole thing go.

The menu is varied with many more choices than just pizza.  I'd likely be a regular if Luigi's were up LKN way but, as it is, I will keep it on the list for when I'm hungry and nearby."}
