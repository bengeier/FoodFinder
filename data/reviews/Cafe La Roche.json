{"text":"A great place if you're into shisha. Although, it may not be the best shisha hangout Toronto has to offer.The food is expensive but the taste isn't anything special. Shisha is pretty cheap compared to other shisha bars but I must warn you, it is harsh. I went a couple times and within the 10 minutes, I was already light-headed and the smoke was already burning my throat. I thought it would be a nice place to lounge around while enjoying peach flavoured shisha for maybe a couple of hours but couldn't manage to stay anymore than a complete hour. Despite the harsh-tasting shisha, the only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because of the welcoming and friendly staff. Every time I visit La Roche, the staff came off as outgoing and patient when it came to my friends and I laughing and disturbing the quiet caf√©."}
{"text":"This place started out really good, because it was the only one in the area where you wouldn't find teenagers. Also the management when it first opened was way better than the current management. 

As of late, the lounge has become extremely outdated - the furniture is old and mismatched. The space doesn't feel cozy like a cafe should. It's change of management also changed the clientele to way older men mostly. It's not a place I'd ever go again in the current state it's in.

I have tried fries there, which were not very good and had the taste of being fried in old oil. I have tried their brownie dessert which was pretty good, but nothing special and not worth the price. Their shisha is okay, but again not worth the price. The only saving grace was the person serving us was very nice - and my sister knew him so that may have contributed. 

The space is very big and well ventilated, and there is a back room where there are pool tables and TV's. The pool tables are operated by coins so you would need change. 

All in all, it's not a place that I would go to again or recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for the first time on a Tuesday night,the place wasn't busy,but that was expected,I thought the decor was very nice,elegant and had comfortable chairs and sofas,the hookah was much better compared to the other shisha cafes in the same area,food took a while to get out but it was decent
I would absolutely go back there because when the girl found out it was my first time there,she gave me a 10% coupon for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great little \"secret\" cafe serving up tasty sandwiches right next to the Middle Eastern Stretch in Scarborough. I tried out their Beef Wraps it was heaven...I had to order another one, the juice was amazing home made and they... also sell Hookah or Shisha with all flavors, loved it, romantic corner that we enjoyed, the Manager very pro offered us some drinks on the house since it just opened, we usually drive farther down to meet friends but this place surely knows how to treat you. Try it , recommended."}
