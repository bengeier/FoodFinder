{"text":"Awesome gelato. Awesome pizza and pasta. I like the kiwi and pineapple best. The staff were really friendly. Clean atmosphere and short lines make it a great place to eat quick."}
{"text":"Casual and tasty, Villa Dolce wins big with me for their Euro-style pizza. The service is quick and friendly, although expect to wait a bit on the busy nights. Location is important as well, so calling in advance to get  one of the better tables is suggested also. They also have outside seating during the summer..."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the pizza scene in Madison. Even though it was crazy busy, the service was prompt and our pizza arrived in no time. If you like gourmet pizza, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Incredible place. One of the best restaurants I've been to while in Madison. The pasta farefalle dish  was unlike anything I have had before. The lemon saffron sauce just made it.  The restaurant felt like a little secret place. Beautiful simple decor. You can tell the owners of his place really thought about whole dining experience making sure the food was the focus. Sometimes you go to a restaurant and they invest so much in the decor and the ambiance you'd think they are trying to compensate for mediocre food.  Not this place. They in no way shy away from putting all the focus on their food.   The owner was there and walking around checking with customers at there tables. I can't remember the last time I was in restaurant.   Thank you for the memorable meal. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner with my family. Great atmosphere, casual and intimate. Wonderful appetizers (love the wild mushroom flatbread, great pizzas and dessert too good to miss. This was our first time here, but we WILL be back. The service was attentive, but not overly so. And the bill left a smile on my husband's face."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Best desserts in town!!! Flowerless chocolate tort is legendary. Beautiful bar tender made delicious martinis! Love the happy hour specials especially the truffle fries!!! Want to try all of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Very good pizzas and stromboli. Great place to go for either lunch or dinner. The pizza toppings are unique and delicious - I'd love to try all of their specialties."}
{"text":"Had the Momma Mia pizza and it was delicious... whatever the sauce is it is so subtle and brings out the other flavors so well. It looks so lack luster, but then just tastes so amazing. Too bad the place is so small."}
{"text":"a tasty and quick lunch in this new \"modern italian cafe\". they have plenty to cater to the vegetarians. the waitress even checked the ingredients of their gelato mix to ensure there were no animal products involved.  i had the amore sandwich, cold on ciabatta bread with artichoke hearts, olive tapenade, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, basil, and goat cheese. yummers.  the gelato was also very good, but this only being the second time in my life trying it; it didn't beat the first gelato taste-test (only one week prior)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and can happily say that they have excellent food and service. The atmosphere is perfect for quiet dinners."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good ambiance. Perfect place to dine when your super hungry. The dessert was delicious... you can't miss desserts if you crave for chocolates."}
{"text":"For a summer out door siting experience I give it 5 stars.  But the food is ok for the price, but if you're bringing NYC pizza prices to WI you better bring some serious pizza.  The one we had was ok, not terrible but not brilliant.  I'm sure the ingredients are fine but it just didn't blow our socks off.  I thought these were going to be a bit thinner crust as they are billed as \"euro\" style pizza's.  They are a cross between New York style and something with fun toppings.    If I want a thin crust pizza in the future and don't really care about sitting outside I'll look at Pizza Bruta first.    We also had the Caprese Salad which was ok.  To make a really good caprese salad you need three things.  A really fresh tomato, really fresh mozzarella and basil.  The tomato was clearly not fresh (probably from CA or Mexico) and it affected the taste.    The gelato we had was pretty good and we will probably come back to get gelato and walk around Middleton or sit outside and people watch.    Overall I wanted to love this place more than I did.  Pizza just ok, caprese was not with a ripe tomato (its late June, there are fresh and ripe tomatoes to be had) and the gelato was pretty good.  Loved the outdoor seating, waitress was just ok.  We will be back, but we're not running back."}
{"text":"the good: Tuesdays is half price bottle of wine night.  nice location in Middleton.  the bad: small portions, overpriced.  the \"side salad\"....one of the dinkiest I've ever seen....iceberg lettuce with a little spinach.  and I paid 5 or 6 bucks for this thing?  rip.  Mac and cheese....tasted good.  small portion, for like 15 bucks.  again, rip."}
{"text":"We visited Villa Dolce for a late-ish Friday dinner. I was somewhat surprised by how spacious the interior was from the look of the exterior. Our seating was a little strange with deep, wide, low chairs, which were comfortable but made for somewhat awkward eating for this short lady. The wine and drink selection was decent. The antipasto platter was heartier than expected, so we ended up with plenty of leftovers from the pizza we ordered, which was fairly good, though it seemed somewhat more expensive than similar pies elsewhere for equivalent quality."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizzas are great - I particularly love their arugula pie. Very good wine list for a small place and the servers are friendly. I have never had a bad meal there. Lastly, the desserts are very good as well."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars out of 5. My wife and I went here a few nights ago. The place was not busy and we were seated immediately. During the first 10 minutes of our wait, not one person stopped at our table; no water, no drink order, not even a menu. After 15 minutes and no service we got up and walked out. One of the staff actually said thank you as we walked by the front counter. Thanks for nothing. We then proceeded to Tutta Pasta several blocks away where we had drinks, salads and pizza all within 10-15 minutes.   The service at Villa Dolce was inexcusable. Had a waiter even stopped by to take our drink order or bring some water I would have been satisfied. Two thumbs way down on this poor exude for a restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an early dinner on a Saturday. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and prosciutto pizza, both were delicious. The portions were generous, the 14\" pizza was perfect for sharing for two or possibly three if you order salads and apps. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was comfortable. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free pasta. Amazing martinis! Service was superb too. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"After having lunch at Villa Dolce a couple of weeks ago, I decided to go there for dinner with my girlfriend.  I was surprised at the prices, but decided to stay.  My girlfriend is gluten intolerant and asked the waitress which dishes were gluten-free.  The waitress said they don't do gluten-free pizzas, but can make any of the other dishes gluten-free.  My girlfriend ordered Shrimp and Scallops and I ordered Pasta Farfalle.  We asked the waitress to make both dishes gluten-free so we could share.  Her dish was mostly pasta with a few shrimps and scallops.  Mine was pasta, as advertised, with a small amount of vegetables.  Her dish tasted pretty good, but mine was too sour (too much lemon sauce).  We did not order any wine or beer.  We had no starters and no dessert.  Just for the two bowls of medium-sized pasta (with a few shrimps and scallops thrown in), our bill came to $46, which meant that the total with tip was over $50.  (Our waitress did not inform us that there is a $1.50 surcharge for gluten-free dishes).   The bottom line is that we thought the food was pretty good, but to pay over $50 for two bowls of pasta was outrageous!  (Please note that the menu prices shown on Yelp.com are no longer current.  Check the restaurant's website for current prices.)"}
{"text":"I went to Villa Dolce last night with my mom and brother. I will start this review on a negative note and say that I found our experience to be unfortunate.   We chose Villa Dolce for dinner for four reasons:  1. It's within walking distance from my home 2. My mom likes Italian food a lot 3. I've never been there 4. People rave about Villa Dolce to me all the time--it's like the Betty White of restaurants in downtown Middleton  The restaurant's interior appearance was a bit \"meh\". The decorations are little tacky, and overall, the place felt a bit like an airport bar that is trying to be swanky. It was still kind of cute though.   I felt the menu lacked variety, unless you like pizza, in which case, there were about 20 types to choose from. This could be where we went wrong, but none of us is crazy about pizza, so we all ordered pasta dishes. We also had the Antipasto appetizer and some drinks.  The appetizer was nice, and certainly big enough for three people to share. I am going to upload the picture I took of it, because I thought it was attractive. It included a variety of Italian cheeses, olives, pesto, olive tapenade, and some basil/tomatoes. It also came with crostini toasts. It might have been my favorite part of the meal because it was pretty free form and you could come up with some yummy combos--my favorite was tomato, pesto, and fresh mozzarella on top of a toast. It was like a mini caprese salad! Yum.  My entree was the Wild Mushroom Ravioli, which according to Yelp, is their best pasta dish. It was ok. I wasn't blown away, but it was tasty. The marsala sauce it came with was really flavorful, but needed to be thickened a bit more, because it was really watery and I had to sop it up with a piece of bread.   My brother had a squash ravioli with a hazelnut, orange liqueur, and brown butter sauce. It was good, but it was very sweet. Almost too sweet for an entree. It needed more \"savory\", maybe some dry wine or lemon juice or something. Again, it was ok, but not mind blowing.  My mom had a pasta dish with farfalle, lots of vegetables, and a lemon-mascarpone sauce. Her entree was probably the worst (I tried all three) because it was very bland. However, the vegetables and pasta were cooked well.  Another annoying thing: I asked the waitress for fresh black pepper once my dish was served, assuming she would grind it on top of our dishes for us, as they do at nearly every Italian restaurant I've ever been too (including the Olive Garden, for Pete's sake) and instead was given a small and rather beat up plastic pepper grinder to use for myself. Maybe that's ok for some, but when I am paying close to $20 per (meatless) entree in a restaurant that is attempting to be fancy, well, they're going to need to step it up.  Overall, if Villa Dolce had more reasonable prices, I would rate it higher. The experience was acceptable, but not for the price. We did have drinks and an appetizer, which drove up the grand total of the bill, but for some perspective, just our three pasta dishes, none of which contained meat or any especially exotic ingredients, ran close to $60.   I am not cheap, and I am willing to pay inflated rates for an excellent dining experience, but Villa Dolce was not an excellent dining experience. The food and service was on par with a place like the Olive Garden, and the prices were on par with a place like Graze. It's not a good combination."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when we entered here. What look were they going for here? You enter, and it looks like a gawdy ice cream parlor, but then as you walk past that, you get to the dining area.  The server was pleasant, and the order seemed to arrive promptly enough. My butternut squash ravioli was delicious. This is a nice place to try if you're in the area, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"EVERYONE. STOP. AND GO TO VILLA DOLCE TO GET SOME GELATO! Seriously their gelato is AMAZING! I was honestly so impressed already by the price and the amount they give in a serving, but really what set the bar was the flavor and the gelato itself.  The flavors taste so real, and the gelato is smooth, creamy, and rich.  Probably the best gelato I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"A perfect cozy place for a girl's night out.  The pizza is my favorite ever - the bolognese pizza is just fabulous upscale comfort food, and the veggie pizza with balsamic glaze is just wonderful.  They have a nice gelato counter too!"}
{"text":"Friends and I ate here tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed our food.  I knocked it down a star for \"meh\" service.  We all ordered a variety of foods and cocktails and we enjoyed everything we had.  One had the black raspberry bellini, one had the Urbanpolitan, and one had the Pama Margarita.  We all really enjoyed our drinks.  We had the calamari and cheese plates for appetizers, mushroom ravioli, squash ravioli, and mac and cheese for dinner.  OMG, I wanted to lick my plate with the mushroom ravioli.  It had so much flavor and was perfectly cooked.  My friend who ordered the squash ravioli doesn't like even like squash (what gives with ordering this, then), but she loved this pasta.  She cleaned her plate it was so good.  My other friend loved her mac with four cheeses, although the cheese mixture was a little too pungent for my liking.  Each meal came with a homemade roll, which was amazing.  We also ordered a Margherita pizza to go, and that was very good, too.  Would definitely return.  Only reason for four stars is that service was slow.  Took 15 minutes on average to receive drinks after they were ordered (15 minutes for drinks!) and our server rarely checked up on us.  She also seemed confused on the drink menu, so she may have been newer.  She had to have us point out our drinks on the menu when we ordered them."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my dad and brother and sister in Wisconsin , I like to go to Villa Dolce! Indigo came with me this last time and we all went for some lunch and coffee. My dining companions had the salmon salad, pizza, and a sandwich  and they all looked (and I was told) tasted great!  Now, I can't for the life of me remember what I had for lunch. I do know what I had for dessert however, tiramisu! It was fantastic! And the mocha, was very good! Not overly sweet.   Only docked one star due to the fact that the salmon was requested on the side and not on the salad (it wasn't my salad but I am allergic to fish so it would have been very important if I had ordered it with the fish separate) and because you order your food at the counter. Ordering at the counter (which is characteristic of a grab and go quick lunch restaurant) seems awkward and counter intuitive for a place where you can linger and chat for awhile over fine food, coffee, and tiramisu.   Indigo gives this place 15 stars for the fabulous ambiance!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews.  We've been coming here occasionally since it opened, our last two times within the past 2 weeks.  The pizza is delicious -- thin crust with light toppings, definitely not your typical American pizza.  My favorite is the eggplant and ricotta one.   We've also had the prosciutto and arugula pizza, my daughters like the meat lovers (I don't care for that much meat on a pizza so it's a bit much for me), and I had one with asparagus and poblano peppers recently.   Service can admittedly be spot-on or spotty, and we haven't tried much beyond the pizzas though there are pastas and salads on the menu too.  Nice wine list and I believe a full bar.  The gelato is quite good.  We love the unique ambiance, kind of an old house with several small rooms so it feels really cozy and intimate.  Street parking only but after hours you can park behind the office building across the street, which is ample."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom on a Saturday night, and we were sat right away. Sitting down was actually a little tricky, because the tables are so close together, and the chairs are so large. We had to move the table so that I could slide into the large, oddly shaped chair, and I'm not a large person. The rest of the décor was a little strange too, but mostly nice. Once you pass the bar it gets better, but the bar area looks cheap (for lack of a better description).  It took a little while for someone to greet us at the table, and by the time she got there, we were ready to order. I ordered the eggplant parm and my mom got the bolognese. Both came out piping hot, and the pasta was fresh. The food tasted great, but it was nothing special. I also think it was slightly overpriced for the food we received. I got 2 1/2cm slices of eggplant for $18. When we were done, it again took quite some time for someone to bring us the check. When we got up to leave, my mom had to move the table again so I could get out of the awkward chair.  3 stars because everything was just mediocre, and somewhat annoying."}
{"text":"Delightful place with excellent cocktails, great salads, and friendly service.  This and Eno Vino are my go- to places on the west side for consistently good food."}
{"text":"We just made our first visit to this year old spot in Middleton, after a great recommendation from friends, and while mourning the loss of Casa Bianca, Madison's closest approximation of NY-style pizza. Madison is not a great pizza town --local Wisconsin cheese lacks the tang of Boston's Regina's or the great New Haven apizza spots, and the corporate Uno's lacks the distinctive pizazz of the Chicago original (we prefer Due's) and its best Chicago competitors (e.g., Lou Malnati's). Given all that, Villa Dolce was a very pleasant surprise. Crusts were excellent, and the imaginative toppings (we are veggie types on our pizza choices) were exceptionally fresh and tasty. In our view, Villa Dolce is a strong competitor for best (upscale) pizza in Madison. We'll make a few more visits before coming to a final decision on that... The gelato we sampled was superb--intense, delicious and distinctive taste and excellent consistency. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. We strongly disagree with another reviewer's comment on service. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic without being overly intrusive. Her recommendations were on the mark, and she suggested favorites we might try on future visits. The seating and environment were comfortable and very pleasant, with seasonal outdoor seating as well. More cafe -like than other pizza places in town. All in all, a winner. We'll reserve a fifth star pending additional visits."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here.  I schedule a lot of work lunches because it's a great, consistent place with friendly staff.  I've never had dinner, but lunch is always outstanding.  The waldorf salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING! Delicious homemade Italian...simply delicious. The service is great. I especially love their gelato and the multitude of flavors! Perfect for a casual date."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Stay next door at the Staybridge on business often. Came over 2 or 3 times with colleagues for dinner.  Food was just not good.  The bread they start out with is the most flavorless bread I've ever had.  The rest of the food is poorly seasoned and prepared.  Won't ever willingly go back."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant in Middleton. Since I was by myself I was seated at the bar; the bartender was cool, while it was slow he chatted with me and made my experience better.  For dinner I had the Mushroom Ravioli. This was good, not the best I had ever had but something I would get again. I didn't get a pizza since there was just me, but they looked good.  Overall, a nice spot to go to for a relaxed yet nice meal, but I would say make a reservation or get there early because they seem to fill up fast."}
{"text":"9/10/13 My wife and I stopped in at Villa Dolce for a drink.  We had no idea they had been in business for 7 years.  We initially sat at their cozy bar, but had to switch to their window seats because they had these really bright string lights blinding us.  We mentioned it to the bartender, but she didn't seem to understand the constructive criticism.  That said we enjoyed our drinks.  My wife had a negroni the size of a small pool.  I had a mixed berry gin lemonade (fresh blueberries & raspberries).  Why haven't I been making these at home?!?!  ;-)  The pizzas, salads, and desserts being served looked delicious."}
{"text":"Went here later in the evening hoping to find a local gem... and I did! The food quality was fantastic and the place is really cool... it's basically an old house, so it's very spread out and quiet. I would have given them 5 stars, but the service was really crappy! Hopefully next time it will be better, and I'll raise the stars!!"}
{"text":"We were at the ice arena in Middleton last night and wanted to eat Italian nearby, so we tried Villa Dolce. The desserts are in a case across from the hostess stand when you enter and they look amazing. There is both inside and outside seating. Several small rooms inside. The hostess greeted us and found us a table inside. Our waitress was friendly.  The menu consists of appetizers, pasta entrees, pizzas, salads, and calzones. Our group had the Shrimp and Scallops; Wild Mushroom Ravioli, Godfather Calzone, Milano Pizza, and calamari. The pasta dishes were perfectly prepared. Calamari and Calzone were both delicious. The crust on the outside of the pizza was crispy but it was flacid and oily in the middle. Our main complaint was that the prices seemed steep for the amount of food. It was tasty, but you can get tasty food at better prices elsewhere.  Although I would not make a special trip to just to get to Villa Dolce, it's fine if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Love love their pizza. One of the best I have had in Madison. I have been here several times, they have consistently been good. Love their service as well. It's always very welcoming and attentive. They have a very good selection of gelato as well.   We tried the wild mushroom pizza, Roma pizzette and Cesar salad today. The wild mushroom pizza was to die for. We all loved it. Will definitely order that again. The Roma was good and the salad was fresh!  If u crave pizza with a authentic thin crust and love an artistic ambience, this is a good pace to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here based on rave reviews from several people who in Middleton and we are so happy we came! This will definitely be a regular dining place for us. The food was so amazing and the outdoor seating just added to the atmosphere. Great place for date night!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple friends for restaurant week. The stromboli appetizer was pretty tasty, whereas the truffle fries were not anything special (small portion, not a lot of truffle flavor). The gnocchi alla vodka was delicious - would definitely try it again! As was the shrimp and goat cheese pizza. The desserts, on the other hand, were underwhelming- we tried the black forest cherry crepe and mini cannoli. They were super stale and flavorless (probably because they mass produced them for restaurant week). I would try this place again outside of restaurant week."}
{"text":"This place was a bit slow getting our dessert to go and it was a bit pricy.  That being said I had an awesome dessert with a chocolate covered strawberry and a fresh raspberry.  I also had the roasted red pepper, fresh mozzarella sandwich.  Very tasty.  A nice lunch with two desserts was about $40.  Without dessert about $20."}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner with friends on a summer Saturday evening after a day on canoes, and our experience was very nice.   Best parts: menu options, food taste/presentation, and atmosphere in their cute little outdoor patio area! Seriously, though... the food... soooo delicious. Vegetarian options were plentiful. Everyone at the table loved their meal from pasta to pizza to apps to salads. I had the waitress surprise me because I couldn't decide, and it didn't disappoint.   Two less than stellar parts about our experience were a very weird version of a strawberry margarita (had to send back and bartender admitted they didn't have the right ingredients for it) and average service. Timely and accurate, but zero charm or personality.   Overall a nice experience! We'll go back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pizza + I'm a big fan of dessert = I'm a big fan of Villa Dolce. This is my favorite cafe in the Madison area. It's got pretty neat decor and an alluring color scheme.  My favorite time to go to Villa Dolce is during lunch, where they serve the \"pizzette\", your own personal pizza with a very enticing price tag. I really dig the roma and the white cheese pizzettes. I'm also very happy with their stromboli of the day specials. Their regular pizzas are also quite tasty with a good variety of selections.   But what I look forward to the most at Villa Dolce is after my pizza consumption. Amazing dessert!! Their gelato is okay, but the tiramisu, chocolate mousse, and nutella crepes are to die for!  Please do yourself a favor and check out Villa Dolce."}
{"text":"I've always loved Villa Dolce but last night they exceeded themselves. We had a birthday surprise party for my boyfriend and they accommodated 12 people in such great style. The food was impeccable and the servers, as always, were a delight. The desserts menu was incredible, we were so comfortable after dinner but we could not say no to their sweets - gluttony at its best on our part. Super nice people. The drinks were so yummy and nothing took too long of a wait. Such a cozy venue, very beautiful interior decor. It was a perfect night, big success! We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Farfalle and mushroom in a sauce of deliciousness! Heard a lot of crunching down the end of the table with everyone's thin pizza crust smothered in gooey cheese deliciousness! Very pleased. Good wine selection and definitely not over priced at all! Good luck for our celebration!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, no soggy crust here. My office came here for a team lunch. We ordered pizza ahead of time and service was prompt for such a large group. Save room for gelato or dessert."}
{"text":"Villa Dolce is an okay restaurant with fairly good food.   The cauliflower soup appetizer was quite delicious. I ordered the seafood pasta for my entree. While the flavor was great and the pasta itself was cooked nicely, I received only four pieces of seafood in the whole pasta: two pieces of shrimp and two scallops. For the price Villa Dolce charged for the pasta, I really should have received more pieces of fish.  My husband ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert, but after his first bite he said to me, \"I like your chocolate mousse better.\"  I personally found the decor inside Villa Dolce confusing. It struck me as very airport-ish/business-office-ish decor. It did not strike me at all as decor suited for a quaint and cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Villa Dolce with their perfectly proportioned pizzas, salads, and soups has been my go to for lunch lately. I usually grab a soup and salad (which comes with a delicious warm breadstick) for a lighter carb lunch; however I do have to say that the pizzettas are delicious!  When in doubt go with the special of the day, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Finally got to return to this place and eat outside on a beautiful night. We had two small pizzas this time time and they were as good as it gets.  They were not salty like so many are and very full of flavor. I had one with a bolognese base and my partner had a margarita. Both were excellent. We shared a salad that was a big mix of stuff like swiss cheese, garbanzo beans, olives and two kinds of lettuce.  No iceberg and no onions which I hate in salads as well as everything else. Great dressing as well. I know this looks like an ice cream shop when you first walk in but it is much more. This is a serious restaurant with serious Italian food. Don't  miss it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really good traditional style Italian. Awesome quality and flavor. A real gem."}
{"text":"So, yet another Restaurant Week post.   Short answer: Don't go here.   I was incredibly disappointed in this place. I had the truffle fries, pizza, and crepe. The truffle fries were good but also had a cheese sauce on them I wasn't expecting. I received maybe 8 fries so the portion was very small.   The pizza was terrible. It was so bad I only ate one piece and I was gagging it down. I tried to mention it to the waiter but he just walked off and then didn't ask again for the rest of the night. I tried to talk to a manager but she was VERY rude and dismissive and just said \"nope, that's how it's supposed to be made\" and took it to box it up. Honestly, it was so bad I didn't even want to take it home and ended up just throwing it away before I even left. To think that it was $20 for a 12 inch pizza on the regular menu is disturbing because it was seriously the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. I will never go back. I understand if it comes out wrong, or just isn't good but in the very rare situation that it is actually so bad that I am willing to say something I expect that they will do SOMETHING to make up for it, either make it again or do a substitution. At the very least I expect to be listened to and not just blamed and then walked away from.   The crepe was a disaster. It was under cooked and very dough-y. On top of that it was cold and tasted like they had just premade a bunch in the morning and then let them sit.   This place is extremely overpriced and the quality doesn't even come close to making up for it. The staff is rude and acts like you are inconveniencing them."}
{"text":"The Linguini Pecorino is full of the  tangy earthy garlic flavor, offset by the umami of the balsamic drizzle. Fresh pasta makes it to die for!  The bread pudding was creamy, sugary decadence  done right, and the Tirimasu, with its rich coffee flavor on bottom, is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great authentic tasting Italian food. I ordered a classic margarita pizza and Caesar salad, I asked for the dressing on the side, which was forgotten. The desserts are delicious and I enjoyed a cannoli served with a chocolate dipped strawberry and other fresh berries and cream. Service is very slow and the restaurant becomes busy by 6:30. So I would make a reservation if you plan on eating around then or after. This is not a child friendly restaurant.. 2/5 dinning experience on a week night."}
{"text":"YUM. I had my margherita pizza delivered so I can't speak to the restaurant's atmosphere but the pizza was so good! The fresh mozzarella was soo good. The crust was thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. There was the perfect amount of sauce that was also very good."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group and was impressed with how well they handled the rather rowdy group of 11. I got prosciutto arugula pizza which is one of my favorites and thought they did it pretty well- I especially liked their addition of a balsamic sauce.  The crust was pretty good but there are better places for authentic pizza. We got a variety of desserts and I liked my tiramisu. The favorite of the table though was the lemon cake."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there today and it was so tasty!    I had the villa panini  which had salami, cappicola ham, brie cheese, mozzarella, dijon mayo, and roasted red peppers.  So tasty!    I also ordered the chocolate explosion and what an awesome dessert!  Chocolate cake with cheesecake pieces.  mmmmm!"}
{"text":"I was lost in little Italy for a while! The front is a small coffee shop where the gelato and all kinds of Italian dessert would take your breath away. Walking pass the dessert counter is a cozy yet charming dining area with comfy sofa chairs and beautiful yellow lighting.   We started with truffle fries for appetizer. It wasn't the best that I have had. Since they only used truffle oil, the rosemary over flavored the truffle flavor. A little bit more cheese would be better. But the portion was definitely very large for an appetizer.  The wild mushroom ravioli was amazing. The mushroom flavor stood out and the creamy sauce was very well seasoned. The beef bolognese was a bit like deconstructed lasagna. But the noodle was definitely hand made because it was very good and homie.   They have a wide variety of dessert and gelato flavors, which all looked so good. We tried the tiramisu and it was very decent. Of course it was coffee flavored but there was also a hint of alcohol in it, which made it so unique.   The restaurant was a nice place for a date night because of the cozy charming ambience. It is a bit pricey though but they do have happy hours on food and on drinks. Wednesday is also a date night special where it is 1/2 off some selected bottles of wine"}
{"text":"Visited Villa Dolce for a friend's birthday.  We had a group of approximately 20 people, and they were very accommodating and had a back room set aside for us.  The place is very intimate, with a variety of smaller dining areas, so it never feels over crowded.  Pizza and pasta were both excellent.  The pizza is a semi-thin chewy crust and the amount of cheese and toppings they use is just-right, not overkill as it is with some other pizza places.  Service was excellent, and our server allowed us to split the checks since some were leaving earlier than others.  Great place, and I would recommend it to others without hesitation."}
{"text":"Found this corner restaurant by chance and was extremely satisfied with the service and the quality of the food. The tables outside and the great weather made it very pleasant to enjoy a nice glass of wine and a really good pasta. Both the pappardelle Bolognese and the wild mushroom ravioli were great. Wrap it up with a nice gelato inside their restaurant. My favorite flavor is the stracciatella."}
{"text":"This is for sure one of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area. I really can't believe the negative comments on the staff and service - everytime I have went (~30+ times!) the staff has been super friendly - many of them recognizing us and commenting so. Service is always excellent. The couple that stopped by and didn't get served for 10 minutes - definitely a fluke mistake. And no clue how anyone could describe the entryway as a gawdy ice cream parlor. Ridiculous. We've hung out there many times eating dessert, drinking wine, and enjoying gelato. They've also just redone their outdoor seating area. Several times we've walked there with our dogs, and enjoyed an excellent meal outside.  We often pop in just for the gelato, which is excellent. Authentic flavors like pistachio (which the hubby gets every single time, cuz it reminds him of our vacay in Italy) and donatella (super rich chocolate - my fav, usually in combo with a fruit flavored one). Occasionally they'll mix in an Americanized flavor like oreo. Other desserts are really good as well, though we usually stick with the gelato because it is soooo yummy.   The pizza is fantastic. I have no qualms about saying that it is the best in Madison. A previous reviewer described the crust exactly as I would so here it is again: The crust here is perfect. it's that authentic chewy, elastic yet crunchy crust. The hubs is a meat eater, I am not, so we usually are at odds when sharing a pizza. Not so here. The Margherita every time. Soooo good. When we have gone with other peeps, we have also partaken of several other of their pizzas, which have all been delicious. My fav is the Misto.  Last time we were there, we shared the arugula and spinach salad which was really amazingly good! A must try, for sure. The balsamic marinated onions went so well on the salad! We've had them before on the antipasto tray (another winner, by the way!).  This is not your typical Americanized fast food restaurant. This is a cool, authentic Italian place. Simple, delicious food. Friendly, laid back staff. If you want deep dish pepperoni za, and cookie dough ice cream with candy in it, by all means, please stay far away from my favorite local joint."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at Villa Dolce.  We sat outside on this warm fall evening.  My wife ordered the beef bolognese, I got the Apolonia salad, my daughter got bowtie pasta with butter and parmesan followed by strawberry sorbet.  It was all delicious and the service was excellent.  We are already thinking of coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week to get a little taste of everything. Depending on what you choose for your main, 3 courses for $25 is a great deal! I love the set-up of this restaurant! It's so cozy with bright lighting. Beware of only 2 bathrooms though.   Truffle fries are always the safe choice to start although the restaurant week portion looked very small, would consider revise the plating for that. Entree favorites were the Gnocchi Alla Vodka (super generous portion size and the sauce is fantastic) and the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Pizza (very interesting combination, but nonetheless yummy). Italian Beef Stew was also generously portioned and tasted good, just not my favorite. I also appreciated bread slices with the stew and gnocchi so you can scoop up all the delicious sauce.   The only let down was dessert - we made the wrong choice! I've heard many good things about the gelato but it's cold outside so we ordered the Black Forest Cherry Crepe and it was a huge let down - premade and sitting in the display for a bit, not great. Stick with the gelato!"}
{"text":"Had a girls-day-out that started with lunch at Villa Dolce. It was the perfect place to sit back and chat while noshing on great food.   I tried the eggplant pizza, and she went for the farfalle pasta. My pizza was incredible. The crust here is perfect. it's that authentic chewy, elastic yet crunchy crust. The combo of the eggplant and ricotta was great. I was surprised and somewhat ashamed that I ate my whole pizza--even the lunch size was quite filling. She felt the same about the pasta. It looked creamy and delicious, with chicken and veggies in a lemony cheese sauce.  I just love the decor, it's fun and bright in that new-retro way(okayyy, it's trendy enough to make it bad, but I like it!)  As I said in my last review, though...skip the gelato. Although, they did have a few other desserts that looked nice."}
{"text":"We took my boyfriend's parents out for dinner here a few weekends ago. The only request was somewhere quiet, as his dad is hard of hearing and wears a hearing aid. My initial thought was Villa Dolce Cafe, given the small dining rooms and quaint atmosphere... not to mention the outstanding food. I tend to be a creature of habit, and once I eat a good meal somewhere I have a hard time ordering something else the next time I go. This restaurant is no different. The last three times I've been here I've ordered the same thing which was the Gorgonzola Pear pizza-- and the last four times I've been here I've been too hungry to take a picture of my food before I eat it! I did manage to snag some pictures of the desserts though (check out the flourless chocolate cake and cannoli below)!  The menu is primarily Italian-based and they offer gelato which is great for warm summer days when you're walking around downtown Middleton, and need a treat. They also have a small vegetarian section, which I always appreciate. Parking can be a little tricky at times however there is a big lot across the street where you can usually find a spot.  One of my Middleton favorites--check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch the other day.  They were understaffed for the crowd and it showed in the service both in quality and quantity (ex: tough to get a refill and then that \"I've got more important things to do\" look from our waiter when we did.)  Yet, the panini were excellent and I like the space.  Good lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite regular haunts. The steak pizza is amazing as is the bolognese pizza. The cocktails are well made and the service is good and consistent. Safe room for some gelato - there is always a good selection.   As a regular patrons, we are always greeted warmly when we arrive and feel like the staff are genuinely happy to see us. It's a local joint - skip the many chains in the area and come to this local joint and have a great pizza!"}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY we found this restaurant last night! We came from Chicago for the night and found Villa Dolce on Open Table. We were thankful to book a reservation because there weren't many available!  The staff is incredible friendly and accommodating, and demonstrated a high level of hospitality and service. We ordered a prosciutto pizza and beef bolognese and both dishes were AMAZING!! On the way out, even though we were so full, we couldn't leave without splurging on gelato, which is probably the best I've ever had. Everything we had was homemade and you can taste it!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once with my family and a couple of family friends, and once on a date night. This place is good for both, I would just recommend making a reservation, cause it can get pretty busy for dinners.   My sister and I shared a calzone the first time. Portions were big, and we were pretty full by the end of it. But of course, we had to order dessert. Now, at most restaurants, desserts end up tinier than you expect. Or maybe it's just me and my huge sweet tooth. So, everybody ordered a dessert for themselves. When the desserts got to our table, I'm sure all our eyes popped out of our heads; they were XL sized desserts! Because I was the only one in my family that lives in Madison, I got to take all the leftovers home. Dessert for breakfast is always okay in my opinion! The flourless chocolate cake was extremely dense, in a good way. But it was also very filling and would have been best shared between two or even three people. The nutella crepes were delicious, but then again, nutella on just about anything would have been delicious. The creme brulee was also really good.   The second time I went there, I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop pasta, and my boyfriend had the Butternut Squash Ravioli. Mine was really good, except I wish they would have seared the scallops, and been a little more generous with the seafood. I only had two pieces of medium-sized scallops, and 3 pieces of shrimp. The ravioli was delicious, albeit the portion size for this was also a little small. Or again, maybe I just have a big appetite and I like to \"share\" from our plates a lot. For the smaller portion sizes in my dish and his dish, I removed a star.   Overall, pretty good restaurant and I will be returning again for sure. Next time, maybe I'll try their pizzas, and I'm definitely coming back for the dessert. One for myself, of course."}
{"text":"Flatbread appetizer was good but that turned out to be the highlight of the meal. The ravioli in brown butter sauce was served in a pool of brown water because the pasta was not properly drained. Further, the angel hair with \"Ahi\" Tuna was an embarrassment and should never have been served. The pasta was in a one piece clump and the Tuna was 80% blood line, it was clearly not Ahi grade Tuna and when I pointed out the waitress she said \"sorry, I don't know anything about fish\". If you decide to eat here, I would advise you to stick with the pizza, the rest is far less then mediocre."}
{"text":"I have been to Villa Dolce a few times for dinner. Food is standard. It does not begin to compare in quality to other restaurants in the same price range I.e. Lombardinos.  Tonite the particularly slow service and lack of service recovery has cemented my decision not to return or recommend VD again. If you want great drinks, quality food and reliable service - do not go to Villa Dolce. Tip to VD- if drinks take 1/2 hour and an appetizer 45 minutes- comp one or the other- trying to justify being behind isn't acceptable"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with fresh ingredients and the service was top-notch.  Keep up the good work Villa Dolce!"}
{"text":"I had a small Misto pizza delivered to my hotel room while I was in town. It was awesome! Since I didn't eat in I can't say anything about the service or the restaurant itself. My food was great so I'll try them again; maybe I'll eat-in next time!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was delightful. I had a grilled chicken panini and a side of pasta salad. Both dishes were delicious and they were very accomadting on my lactose intolerance. They had no problem when I requested no cheese on my panini or in my salad.   In addition, the atmosphere was enjoyable and the service was friendly and efficient.   I recommend Villa Dolce and plan to come here again."}
{"text":"A perfect stop for me. Wanted a good quality glass of wine and a snack. Had both and to my surprise at happy hour prices ! Lamb sliders, think lamb patty bruschetta and very nice Italian wine. Under $30 for 2 glasses of wine and a \"appetizer\" that was more than adequate as dinner. Yummy, good service, nice decor ..... A reminder that locally owned wins every time!"}
{"text":"While Villa Dolce has its detractors, I've been pleased with my numerous meals at this Middleton eatery.  While prices are on the high side given the casual setting, I have found the food to be particularly well composed.  I'm a HUUUUUUGE fanboy of their Milano pizza (mild Italian sausage, tomato sauce, green peppers, mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh herbs, mixture of mozzarella, gorgonzola and parmesan cheese).  The thin crust offers a pleasing combination of exterior crunch and interior chew.  On its own, the sauce is not exceptional, but it effectively compliments the crust and toppings.  The toppings are the real star - I adore the interplay between the sweet caramelized onions, the perfectly seasoned Italian sausage and the three cheese topping of this pie.  This pizza also travels well, making it a great carryout choice.   My only qualm is the price, at $17.99 for a 12\" pizza is steep, especially when a person can go to Pizza Brutta, Lombardino's or Grampa's and get a great pizza for $5 less.  At lunch recently, I wandered off the Milano pizza reservation and tried the Italian Beef Panini accompanied by a bag of chips ($8.59).  The sandwich featured a thickly sliced crusty white bread that had a great sear from the grill.  Like the pizza, the well-composed flavor combinations of the sandwich won me over.  While it's a busy sandwich (roast beef, roasted red peppers, onions, mushrooms, basil pesto, smoked red pepper aioli and mozzarella), the components really complement one another.  Again, the price is on the high side at $8.59, but absolutely no complaints about the quality of the sandwich.  While the restaurant serves up a full dessert menu, including twelve types of gelatos, I usually find myself taking the short walk down the block to Bloom Bake Shop to grab a pastry on the way back to my car.  Partitioned into several dining areas, the interior of the restaurant allows you to have an intimate meal with your dining companion, even though the place is always packed with lunch time diners.  There also is a terrific outdoor seating area with the weather permits it.  A set of windows facing Parmenter Street illuminate the front of the restaurant with natural light, while the back of the restaurant can get a little dark.  The entryway into the restaurant features a chic looking full bar.    You order and pay for your meal at the front counter, and then a server will drink your food and drinks to your table, which seems out of place given the prices.  Service quality varies, but it's OK more times than not.  If it weren't for the prices, I would patronize Villa Dolce more often than I do since I am a huge fan of their pizzas and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm a big-time foodie and very active on yelp and I CANNOT BELIEVE this place only gets 3 stars.  I grew up in Madison and IMO, this is one of the only decent restaurants on the West Side.  It's THE restaurant I most look forward to when I come home, and THE Madison restaurant I wish would start a location in Boston, where I live.  The pizzas are awesome.   The pear-gorgonzola one is to die for, get it.  The salads are the best I've EVER had outside of a $30-entree type establishment.  Their Waldorf is the best apple/chicken type salad I've ever had, and their Apolonia (Greekish with marinated red peppers, olives, feta, caramelized onion) is amazing.  The Tagliatelle Bolognese is good but their Wild Mushroom Ravioli is to DIE for.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven't been that impressed with a few of their sandwiches, or their desserts (other than the Tiramisu, which is great).  Not bad, but not mind-blowing.  Don't get the sandwich with smoked salmon.  It sounds so good but the flavor combo is just off... I couldn't finish mine.  Still, if you order right this is the best place on the West side of Madison.  Give it a chance, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and pastas. They make an amazing margarita and other craft cocktails. Service was great, and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, delicious bruschetta.  Their pizza is the best in town, hands down.  No grease drippings, no cheap ingredients.  The prices are more than the average pizza place, but worth it.  The 5-star rating is relative; don't expect L'Etoile, but do expect friendly, neighborhood service from a wait staff who have been employed there for several years.  The place gets packed, especially on weekends, and since the it's comfortable the wait times can be long.  It's fun to sit outside in the summer, and to enjoy the half-price bottles of wine on Wednesday evenings."}
{"text":"A cute little gellato (Italian ice cream) and pizza parlor with interesting pizza toppings and lots of creative gellato flavors. Service is friendly but can be pretty slow, so don't come here if you're in a rush.  We sat at the outdoor tables on a beautiful evening. Our kids had a couple Italian sodas, we shared the wild mushroom flatbread appetizer (delicious) and a shrimp and goat cheese pizza -- all very good."}
{"text":"It's ok.  I wish there was better in Middleton. Don't get me wrong, the staff is super sweet, there's plenty of space to sprawl out for an afternoon work session or lunch with the ladies... I just abhor the interior. Not only does it feel like a cheap Vegas lounge (like REALLY cheap) but it's usually really dirty. The windows need some deep cleaning, floors too, then maybe I'd post up more often. The gelato is nice, would be nicer if they made it all in house."}
{"text":"This is a very unique atmosphere but trendy! The food was great. Wished the wait staff had been more attentive, we had to wait a long time to get things we asked for. But the food was very good."}
{"text":"Out for another week of new restaurants for Madison's Restaurant Week. Truly, I had hoped that this experience would have been far better. Very little was up to par, especially for a higher price locale like this.  So let down that I'm not fully sure where to begin, so I'll just go through each aspect.  SERVICE (0 of 5): It started out well. But during the 15+ minute wait between our appetizers and our food, things went downhill fast.  My girlfriend's soda was empty long before the main dish arrived, yet the server didn't offer any refills of it until after the dessert had came.  When the dessert did come, we were only halfway through our entree, leaving the desserts to sit at our table for 10 minutes, rushing us.  When we finally started on our desserts, the server came back to refill our waters. Without warning, she just reached over my girlfriend's plate and grabbed her glass while she was eating. In addition, our server's lack of attentiveness prevented us from trying to rectify many of the issues that we had.  FOOD (1 of 5): The Salmon Mousse and Butternut Squash soup were both incredibly good.  With a decent selection of wine, things started off very good. It made the lengthy wait between the appetizer and the entree more bearable.  However, when the main dish came (we both had the grilled Wild Salmon), things changed dramatically.  It was served with rice and asparagus, both completely cold, and then the salmon with a nice hollandaise sauce.  My salmon was also only half cooked, medium-rare by fish standards. For dessert, we had a Black Forest Crepe and a Flour-less Chocolate Torte. Both were very good. Though, after staring at them for ten minutes and having just had such a poor main course, their splendor was much less than I would have believed them to be.  MANAGEMENT (0 of 5): As our server was not attentive and could not simply just leave this, I found the MOD after our meal.  I explained the poor service, including the desserts being brought extremely early, and how our food was cold and not fully cooked.  Her response was a simple, \"Thanks for telling me.\"  Now, I had already paid, resolved to not go back, and as such, didn't seek anything free or a discount.  But I have to say, after working in food service for over 13 years, I was in awe that she did not even try to resolve the issue. Nothing so much as offering an apology.  That lack of customer service speaks volumes for the place as a whole. For if the leaders are not concerned with customer satisfaction, why should the rest of the staff be?   Overall, if you're just looking for a quick dessert, this could be great.  But any place that doesn't put the customer first is not a place that will inspire you to return. I know I won't be."}
{"text":"Food was average, but more what I'd expect from a cheap chain than a somewhat pricy local restaurant.  Focaccia appetizer was toasted until dry, not the light pillowy bread you expect.  Seafood pasta was OK - shrimp and small scallops were overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  The cannoli was a disgrace: pre-filled soggy shell and rubbery filling.  They had a great idea pairing some tables with armchair-like seats, but the fabric has seen better days and is now looking worn and dirty.  Service was fine.  I probably would have given them three stars if their prices were lower and more in line with the quality."}
{"text":"Truffle Fries - YUM! Spinach Artichoke Pizza - Mhmmmmm! Nutella Crepes - UM, YES PLEASE!  This was the best meal I've had in the last year. Let's start at the beginning.   My boyfriend and I ordered the truffle fries and a pizza to share. The truffle fries came out while my boyfriend was mid-story. He was talking, grabbed a fry, put in his mouth, and stopped talking. It was like he was mesmerized by them. Him and I both cared about nothing else in the world while we ate those darn fries.   Then, the pizza came. I had to convince my boyfriend to try something a little out there. We weren't disappointed! You'd guess a spinach artichoke pizza might be a little heavy and rich, due to the fonduta sauce. But, the toppings and sauce were? perfectly balanced. Because both our appetizer and main were so delicious, we opted for dessert too.   Let me tell you about this dessert. It was TO DIE FOR. I don't need to say more. Order it; bathe in it; enjoy it; thank me later."}
{"text":"So delicious.  We had the salmon & beet salad and a pear gorgonzola pizzette.  Both were divine.  The sidewalk seating was fantastic for this summer weather."}
{"text":"I've always heard that this place is a hidden gem in Middleton, and it definitely is. Tried pasta and pizza.  For their pasta, it was very flavorful but not too salty nor too oily. Mixed with a lot of ingredients and you can taste them in every single bite. Their pizza is thin-crusted and very crispy. It looks simple, but is so far the best Italian pizza I've had in town. I would suggest to come with a group of 4 so that you can order different food and share the dishes together. They're all in large portions. The desserts also looked pretty delicious but I was already too full after my pasta and pizza. Need to try next time."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to catch up over dinner at Villa Dolce.   Overall, the food was decent. We ordered a cheese board which came with three types of cubed cheese, almonds, a fig spread, and crackers that probably came from Costco. My seafood pasta only had two shrimp and two scallops. I guess was expecting a bit more after reading the description.   Anyway, staff was friendly until my friend and I were asked to leave after paying the check to accommodate other guests. The waitress said and I quote \"Ladies, would you mind?\" - gesturing for us to leave - and followed with \"we have other guests waiting to be seated.\" Since the dining room is tucked away behind the entrance, there was no way for us to know that they had such a wait. From a customer service perspective, I was super disappointed and left pretty displeased. There's not really a nice way to ask folks to leave, but she can certainly work on her tactfulness if this situation happens in the future.  To add another detail, there was another slightly older couple sitting right behind us who had been there longer and also finished paying the check.  To close, it's a cute place with good variety and gluten free options on the menu. Just try to avoid going on a busy night. You may be \"politely\" asked to leave/make room for others."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh made pasta including gluten free options. Love the three course tour if Italy for $25 (cocktail, starter and entree)."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened (There used to be a great breakfast/lunch diner located here, but the owner retired. I was so bummed!) Anyway, Villa Dolce has made the inside chic and cozy. The pizzas are fantastic! The unique cocktail choices exquisite! I walk my dog past almost every afternoon and always see the owner there cleaning and stocking. We may go downtown Madison to a fancy steakhouse, but this is where we stop for an after dinner drink. Word has gotten out about this place, so I'd recommend reservations for Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a Friday date night.  The food was delicious as were the cocktails, the service was great too.  My pasta had butternut squash in it and my husband got the Bolognese. I would highly recommend either.  The ambiance was cozy but nice.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Lunch today. Pizza was wonderful the crust is amazing. Side salad with balsamic vinegar être was good. Fairly large selection of wine. Great atmosphere and we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! It's in a home style setting so more unique and cozy but each room, like a home is separate so you don't feel you are on top of others. It's upbeat atmosphere and service is good- you feel like family. Nice place for adults but kids are welcome."}
{"text":"Very good food, but not as good as it should be for the price... -Tomato in the caprese salad was unripe and a bit mealy - this is totally unforgivable as tomato is 1/3 of this dish's ingredients. -'Sauce' on the ahi pasts dish was extremely oily and almost totally flavorless. -Wild mushroom ravioli was outstanding. -Gelato is almost as good as real Italian gelato, delicious.  -Servers are a bit pretentious, but not outright rude. -Good wine menu. -Dinner for two with a bottle of wine, no dessert, one appetizer: $95"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week which was our first time being here.  I really liked the interior, however I'm not sure if it's fitting for a restaurant.  It seems more like a happy hour kind of seating arrangement.  Either way, it's a nice change and something different.  We had the meatballs and the bolognese stromboli.  I was not impressed with the meatballs as they were soggy and the stromboli, while it was tasty was burnt on the bottom.  Next I had the crabcakes with arugula strawberry salad and my boyfriend had the beef brisket.  The crabcakes were decent as well as the strawberry salad that accompanied it, the orzo risotto however is nowhere close.  It was plain old orzo with too much non salted butter added to it.  There was absolutely no flavor, no resemblance of risotto and was slightly overcooked.  The beef brisket was no where near a tradition beef brisket, but rather a traditional pot roast.  However, the sauce was good and the vegetables were cooked correctly.    I think we will go back not during restaurant week and probably stick to pizza and see if they can master that."}
{"text":"I only come here in the summer because they have great outdoor seating and their food is OK.  Wine selection is good and prices are on the high side of reasonable but again if they didn't have such a great location with outdoor seating I wouldn't visit.  Service is ALWAYS slow....we sat outside the other night and waited 15 minutes after plates were cleared for our bill, which we finally went and got ourselves.  Pizza is your best bet...great variety of choices."}
