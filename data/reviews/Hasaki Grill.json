{"text":"It's a nice lunch spot in Uptown Charlotte. Has really good hibatchi at reasonable lunch prices. The sushi however is something to be desired. The prices are kinda high for the portion sizes and and are much smaller in comaparison to places like Sushi 101. Overall its a good spot for lunch to get in and out quickly. The decor is nice and the service is decent."}
{"text":"Great value and good food. A fairly healthy option nestled between burger joints and unaffordable high-end options. Shrimp sauce is mild and good on the beef!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for dinner last night and it was absolutely delicious. I got the stir fry udon noodles with shrimp and it was cooked exactly how I liked it. I'm still thinking about how good it was, so at least for me, it was a nearly perfect dish. She got a Spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll, and something else I don't remember but all 3 were great. We shared plates and both thoroughly enjoyed everything. The service was good and I thought prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and location. Very easy to walk off the meal afterwords because you're right in the city. Will definitely be revisiting this place un the future, especially with out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Star is for the very friendly server. DO NOT GO FOR SUSHI.  This is probably  a great lunch spot for warm Japanese food but not a dinner reseraunt. Food was ok, atmosphere  like a take out, friendly staff.  Harris Teeter has better sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food spot downtown. Get the hibachi chicken!"}
{"text":"Hasaki used to be great.  But the portion sizes have gotten smaller for the Habachi lunch specials."}
{"text":"Great spot - wonderful food and service, really a surprise neighborhood gem. We will definitely go there again. Randy was the best!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Only reasons it's getting 4 stars instead of 5: the calamari appetizer was very small, maybe 7 or 8 rings, and they don't have soda water. Otherwise the place is a great value. Nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive service and super tasty hibachi dinner for the price of lunch? Yes please!"}
{"text":"I work next door and really didn't give it a thought until a friend invited me for lunch. When I first walked in I was impressed, not with the ambiance but the crowd waiting to order. My impression was the food must be really, really good for all this mass hysteria. And there was a reason to this madness - the food is GOOD!

The ambiance, casual and a little noisy but who cares if the food is that good. The lunch crowd on week days makes seating limited so carryout maybe the way to go."}
{"text":"Great local spot for lunch. Quick and good. The workers are super nice as well! I had the steak and mushrooms and it was cooked perfect.  Took less than 5 min to get the food as well."}
{"text":"Our first time to this restaurant and it was spot on! We shared the spring rolls, cherry blossom sushi and it was excellent.  We got the filet and jumbo shrimp and the chicken and broccoli combo dinner and it was the best we have ever had! The filet melted in your mouth and the shrimp was a generous portion and delicious! The chicken was tender and the shrimp sauce so yummy! The food was so fresh! Our server, Kathy was the nicest server we have had since we moved uptown. We are so excited that we found this restaurant! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday for lunch. There weren't many places open uptown and my friend had mentioned this place just opened up. Decided to give it a try and I have to say it was pretty decent. 

First thing I noticed was that the decor was very nice. Although the menu sign needs some work. The wait staff was attentive and friendly, as they should be. I ordered the Hibachi Steak and Mushrooms and my friend ordered the Hibachi Chicken. I also ordered 3 pieces of Salmon Sashimi and the dragon roll. The steak was cooked pretty well. I tried a piece of my friends chicken, and it was a bit dry. The sashimi was fresh, and the dragon roll was very good. Surprisingly good actually. 

Overall I would rate this place 4 stars because pricing is very good. It's not as expensive as other hibachi restaurants, particularly since it's uptown. The hibachi is above average. The sushi is pretty exceptional. I would hit this place up again."}
{"text":"I really didn't like the mushy baked carrots.  Not only were they as soft as baby food, but they were almost candied from having cooked all day.i liked the rice."}
{"text":"Great sushi & hibachi spot! Food is reasonably priced! delicious! I recommend the angry bird roll and the coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"I'm new to working Uptown 5 days a week in the south/Wells Fargo/Duke Energy/Ally area. Coworker took me here today, and I was duly impressed!

The line gets long, but moves quickly. Tables were always available, but just barely, around the noon lunch hour. They do a lot of carry out business.

The food was a very, VERY tall step above what you get at Tintin, up north where BofA offices are located. If you dine-in, your meal is served on a nice plate with real silverware and sauce.

For lunch I got the steak and broccoli, substituting onions & zucchini for sweet carrots (.50 cents) and a soda.

The food arrived quickly and was delicious! It was honestly like eating at a Benihana without the drama of a table show. The steak was perfectly cooked, the meal was tasty and filling, and it was the best amount of food to avoid a full-on afternoon food coma. Great value for the money spent!

Added bonus: Huy Fong Sriracha at the table!

It was so delicious, I plan on going tomorrow for my weekly lunch with my husband! This is a gem. I foresee many more lunches spent here."}
{"text":"Great food here but I've been frustrated with their changes these past couple of months. In short, their prices rose and portions decreased. Not a place I'll be continuing to visit in the future."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but definitely only average. Their takeout is ready quickly but it's not anything to phone home about. Employees are always nice."}
{"text":"Scene - lunch visit. 
Order - miso soup, soft shell crab roll, tuna sashimi.

strike 1 - Bug in miso soup.
strike 2 - have me tuna nigiri than sashimi
strike 3 - tuna was million miles away from being sushi grade. Probably more suitable for a well-done tuna steak sandwich.
Epic Fail Bonus - shortchanged me on order of sashimi (gave 2pcs than 3pcs)

Ambience - does it matter at this point? But, casual, little loud. More like a fast food lunch joint than sushi place.

Judgement - 1 star."}
{"text":"I was driving around town...searching for something different, new to try before going to a jazz concert last night...and remembered seeing Hasaki after going to Knights Theater.  I quickly tuned into my reliable source for great reviews....Yelp and was excited to see the great reviews for Hasaki.  So...I made a few u-turns...and turned a corner or two...and found offstreet parking within a half block of the restaurant.  Entering...it was quiet....just a couple of patrons.  The ambience was very nice.  It had the comfortable feel of a nice place to eat.  So...my quest began for a simple meal...an d a nice vino or beer....and what started out as a 5 star rating...began to go down fairly quickly.  I took away a half star because the waiter had no knowledge of the specials...or what was the most popular items.  Also, no knowledge of how dishes were prepared or what was included.  So...had to wing it.  Started with the spring rolls...and found that they were processed items out of freezer box!  That meant another 1/2 star.  Down to 4....could it get worse?  I was hoping it would not.  So, I started on my second appetizer...the jumbo fried shrimp tempura...OK...that was good!  And as I searched for my pinot noir...it was not to be found.  Nearly 10 mins after ordering....there was a challenge uncorking the bottle.  OK...so the liquor license was just issued....aaaaaaahhhhh no excuses. (down to 3 stars)  OK...on to the main entree.... Hibachi chicken with mushrooms....no...I had to have brocolli...something green.  OK...the entree arrived.... and the chicken was very chewy...tough....and almost tasteless. I wish I could stay with 3...but down to 2 stars.   Had to season with soy and Tabasco.  It was quite a challenge getting through the meal.  Fortunately....the other entree ordered was filling.  The hibachi shrimp with rice!
OK....so maybe on a Friday night....it was just difficult to get it all right!  Perhaps I will try again.....sometime I will get back for sushi and add some stars back to this rating!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time today just to give it a second chance, what a terrible decision.  The quality of their steak is so low that they have to cook it med-rare to keep it soft, once it gets cold, the meat becomes hard again like chewing bubble gum. The first time I was here I ordered a chicken and scallop. The chicken is so dry and scallop was not cooked enough. Had to depend on the water down shrimp sauce to swallow the chicken. I would much rather go to Fuji Hibachi @ epicenter instead for much better quality of food for the same price."}
{"text":"I rolled in here at 6:00PM on a Monday night. The server met me quickly and brought me my water. I had looked at the menu before going so I knew what I wanted. They have a sheet to check off what sushi you want. I got a crunchy shrimp roll and it was fantastic. I also got the 'normal' California roll and a spicy tuna roll. Very good, well rolled and fresh. Would defintely come back."}
{"text":"the entrees are very reasonably priced for lunch and good portions as well. I got the hibachi chicken which was great and reminded me a lot of tin tin box noodles. 

line to order moved a little slow and then you get a number for the food to be delivered to your table.  Very clean and the staff was polite and helpful.  good lunch spot for those in that downtown area."}
{"text":"stopped in for dinner, this is a really casual place but the food is good.
I had the chicken teriyaki with broccoli, and it was very flavorful and the portion was large. And as mentioned before, the shrimp sauce is to die for. This is a great spot of an easy dinner and good habachi."}
{"text":"We came here before a Knights baseball game, great for the family. Friendly staff and really good food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, especially given the lack of alternatives in the uptown area. However, it's pricier than you might expect. A teriakyi salmon and veggies will set you back 11 bucks vs. maybe 7 bucks at a mall. Nonetheless, I am a regular customer because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service with entertainment on the side! The cashier who took my order broke into a song by Black Eyed Peas to impress me with his Tagalog(Philippine language) skills. He's from India by the way, so I was quite impressed! I didn't understand the song but it was still a treat! I had the dragon roll which was not only beautifully presented-its flavors were on point! The shrimp tempura was crispy and tender, the rice was cooked and seasoned well and the generous eel sauce made the sushi roll doubly delicious. I ordered edamame on the side and I enjoyed it as well. It was a great choice for my first lunch in Charlotte. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, CA and as a tourist in this city:

The Hasaki Grill and Sushi is located amidst a very nice metropolitan scenery. From where I come from this place is slightly expensive when it comes to their sushi and the selection in limited. However, that doesn't mean that their selections are terrible!!

I ordered the Philly Roll with avocado instead of cucumber. Simply because that is how Philly rolls are made back in LA, so just my preference. The Philly roll was okay to say the least; reason being was because it was made with smoked salmon instead of fresh salmon. The Panther roll and Yellowtail Nigiri Sushi were very tasty. I loved how the Yellowtail ever so gently melted away in my mouth and crumbled into small tasty/buttery bits. The panther roll excelled at giving me that crunch I wanted.

After all is said and done I am satisfied with the customer service and the taste of the food (minus the smoked salmon taste in the Philly). My four star rating is due to the fact that the price was more of a 2 rather than a 1. If I knew that coming in I'd probably give a 5. I rarely write reviews but when I travel I like to leave a little mark."}
{"text":"So yummy and fresh! Perfect addition to downtown :) a but small but what else do you expect in the area.  Spring rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time but we always get take out. So today was the first time I have actually dined in and you always forget how good food is when is right off the grill but I was definitely reminded today. Don't get me wrong their take out is great too! Fast service and good food. One of my favorite lunch spots uptown!!!"}
{"text":"literally everything about this place is to rave about. my friend and I split the teriyaki chicken and a roll of sushi (dragon maybe?) and it was all amazing. great service. comfortable seating. 10/10."}
{"text":"This was my first time here for dinner and not really knowing what to expect my I was excited to try a new place but for me this experience was just A-OK. 

We were seated immediately and given our menus. It's a mix of hibachi and sushi and you order at the table and they cook it behind the scenes and bring it out to you. Cool, enough. I'm definitely a bigger fan of the places that cook the food in front of you...but I digress. 

We started with the spring rolls. They were very tasty. They arrived hot and crispy and the dipping sauce was delish. For my meal I ordered the steak and shrimp and added the mushrooms and onions. The portion sizes were really good here and the food wasn't bad by any means. It was just A-OK. 

Sure, I'd go back if I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite. But I wouldn't make a special trip..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. This is one of my favorite Japanese places in Charlotte. They give you plenty of food, it comes out pretty quick, white sauce is a difference maker. Never big crowds or anything. Great for a quick bite or take out."}
{"text":"Amazing hibachi! My husband and I come here sometimes for lunch. Their prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food! I always order vegetable hibachi with teriyaki sauce and it is by far the best teriyaki sauce I have had anywhere in Charlotte. Also, their sweet carrots come with your meal and are delicious! My husband orders steak hibachi and he loves it too! Definitely a favorite lunch place in Uptown!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for Japanese food. I got the vegetable dish and Jacob got Filet and shrimp. He got a glass of cab did not like it and we are not snobby wine drinkers. He then tried the merlot and it was a little better but not much. We weren't expecting much for the alcohol at a place like this but he thinks box wine is great. Their house salad is a pretty good size, came with his meal. Mine I think was technically a lunch order so I had to add it. All the prices on the menu were very reasonable I would come back."}
{"text":"The Hasaki Grill is a typical fast casual style Japanese restaurant focused on Hibachi and Teriyaki style dishes.  It has the usual steak, chicken, shrimp, etc., so don't expect much originality here.  You have wait in line before giving your order and, depending if its there or to go, given a number.  The facilities are clean and very modern; though because of limited area, the tables are all joined together and could make for awkward company.

The prices for the dishes are slightly cheaper than other similar restaurants in the Uptown area.  The meal is served on actual plates, though portion size are smaller though than average.  All meals typically come with shrimp sauce and drinks are self serve.  Reasonable wait time.

In my visit, I ordered Hibachi steak with zucchini and onions instead of carrots, which was a small price addition.  Taste wise, it was okay... the sauce utilized was sweet, not expected for Hibachi.  I ate all and it was okay, but because the portion size is smaller, I was still kind of hungry.  Overall, I give it three out of five:  Very nice place and less expensive; but with lesser portions and sweet tasting Hibachi."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service, good fresh food. I had sushi, hubby had chicken teriyaki, and we split spring rolls; everything was excellent. Reasonable prices, too - our total was &18. An Uptown restaurant WITH free parking. We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I actually found Hasaki Grill through yelp! The delicious pictures plus the ridiculously affordable prices were what convinced me. About $6/$7 for hibachi/teriyaki grill? I'M DOWN! (That is if you just get a regular item, like teriyaki steak or chicken..etc)

The interior has a nice blend of a modern vibe with hints of asian accents. I love that the table has old chinese/japanese scriptures. The splashes of red in combination with dim lighting sets a very relaxed mood.

Most items on the menu are about $10 or less, unless you get a dinner plate. We ordered Beef Udon Noodles, Teriyaki Steak & Scallop Combination Plate and a Rainbow Roll. I'm a huge fan of udon noodles in general so I was curious how they would taste here. The dish was delicious, but I've had better. The teriyaki steak & scallop plate was my favorite. The meat was very tender and the dish was overall very flavorful. I will probably just get steak next time though. They didn't give much scallops anyways. Regardless, the portion sizes were relatively large. The sushi is the reason why I took away a star. Although the presentation was nice, the pieces fell apart every time I tried to pick up a piece. Plus, the overall roll was somewhat bland. 

I think with minor tweaks here and there, Hasaki would become a great go-to place in the future! OH btw.. they randomly threw in pho in their menu. It kinda took me by surprise, but I'm kinda curious how pho would taste here.. maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Um, I think I have found my new spot for my hibachi & sushi fix!

Service: A++! With a table of 11, service was fantastic! Quick ordering & a reasonable amount of time to have the food brought out.

And the food: OH MY. 

Sushi: Crunchy roll, panther roll, rainbow roll & Hasaki roll. Nice portions, full of flavor & taste. Nice presentation!

Entree: Seaweed salad & squid salad.  Both had a nice \"kick\" to them!  The squid wasn't chewy; it was perfect.
 
I had the hibachi steak & mushrooms, with zucchini & onions instead of carrots. It comes with fried rice. DELICIOUS! Good pieces of steak & they're not skimpy on the mushrooms, onions & zucchini. My boyfriend had the steak & scallops. WOW. The scallops were HUGE & very flavorful. AND...the entire entree coves the WHOLE plate, yes, THE WHOLE PLATE! Love it...
Fried ice cream & fried cheesecake to top off your meal. 

Pricing: Very reasonable. What I consider lunch prices is the price all the time!

Ambiance: upbeat dance music & lovely earth tones...& unique lighting fixtures.  Many tables & a few booths.

Additional details: Smiley faces on the ginger dressing on the salad & credit card / business card \"take with\" menus."}
{"text":"My colleague took me here for lunch, maybe because I'm Asian 

It gets pretty busy during lunch hours with all the business people. The atmosphere is busy, a sit-down-eat-and-go kind of place...at least for lunch. 

I ordered a steak with shrimp, and it comes with a mild mayonnaise. The ingredients are very fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Great spot for an uptown lunch. If you're going during the week be prepared to wait if you get there right at noon. It gets CROWDED. The prices are good and the food is always quality. The portion sizes fluctuate which can be frustrating. If you enjoy hibachi this is a great place to go for a lunch."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, love the way the take care of you quickly even when there is a crowd. Had one of the waiter insist on taking my food back because he needed to be sure it was hot and fresh!!! He told me, the cooks know he needs to see steam coming from that plate. They also give a nice sizeable portion too."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi I've ever had, including drive through places. It's edible, but that's about it. Food came out too quickly- there's no way it was made fresh. Rice dry, chicken overdone."}
{"text":"This little place just opened today, 8/29. I had the yellowtail nigiri, a spicy salmon handroll, and the dumplings (potstickers). First - day 1 opening pains were obvious - we came early to miss a crowd, and I'm glad we did. Line went to the door and a lot of folks walked out while waiting for the cashier to take orders. Give 'em time. 

The Yellowtail Nigiri was a mixed bag: fish was wonderfully fresh (1 point), the sushi chef did not use Wasabi (-1 point) and the rice was less than well cooked (-1 point). The handroll was similarly mixed: the ingredients were very tasty, but the seaweed wrap was stale and chewy. The thing that saved the day was the potstickers: I got the pork, and even though they were small, they were perfectly prepared and delicious. 

Servers were confused and a little lost, but that was opening day newness going on. They were extremely polite and checked on us frequently. Let's hope that stays the same over time 

I am being generous by giving 3 stars here. We'll go back in a few weeks and try again. I'm hoping they get it together, because I work in the building and it would be nice for this place not to suck. Updates to follow."}
{"text":"Had the chicken udon and spicy tuna roll. Both were good. Service was good. Mostly clean. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is close to my apartment and I frequently get take out sushi. It is good quality, nothing fancy but certainly does the job"}
{"text":"Decided to try for lunch today instead of my other usual place. I ordered the hibachi chicken with broccoli, fried rice and paid the extra .50 for zucchini and onions instead of sweet carrots. The food is bland. I've never had fried rice like this before, I wish I could've just ordered steamed brown rice. I had to add soy sauce to the rice to actually eat it and then added shrimp sauce to the entire meal for it to at least taste good. The shrimp sauce seemed a little more watered down than I'm use to. The service was good and place is well kept,  but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and it used to be a great value but they keep raising their prices for some strange reason and therefore I will no longer be a customer. I used to go twice a week but no more. Not a good business strategy."}
{"text":"I work in the bldg. and this is the go to place for lunch.  Teriyaki does not compare to West Coast.  There is like no teriyaki just some brown sauce.  The most flavorful items are the spray used so the fried rice doesn't stick to the grill and the sweet carrots.  The shrimp sauce is ok."}
{"text":"I ordered the Combination of Chicken and Beef with Mushroom and Broccoli. It was delish. I really enjoyed the cream sauce they provide with the meal. I also ordered a California role and it was about 1/2 the size that I was expecting but it still tasted good. I ordered over the phone and it was ready when I got there. Seamless."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Japanese STYLE Teppanyaki grills. OK, so this one is not your traditional \"chop chop\" restaurant where they cook it in front of you. But the result is just the same. DELICIOUS. Recently discovered this place as our original destination was the American Roadside Grill (see my review on that place). It's right next door on Church street. 

First and foremost. This is mainly a LUNCH place. I believe they serve dinner, but it is crazy crowded for lunch. And after dining here, I know why. Their food is quite simply DELICIOUS. Oops...I used that word again. But it applies! 

First time I had the steak and scallop combo. When I got it, I thought that this is as good as most full service Teppanyaki grills, and trust me, I've been to MANY in my lifetime....throughout North America! Flavor profiles are great. And the food portions are LARGE, at least for the combos. Not cheap (~$12) but WORTH it. Bear these things in mind if you order a combo....

Second time I had the lunch special. More reasonable size and only $8, and that included a spring roll (delicious too) and a drink!

They call it \"Shrimp Sauce,\" most call it \"Yum Yum\" sauce. It's that very yummy pink stuff that they serve at Teppanyaki grills.I don't know exacctly what's in it, but it would make shoe leather taste good! Seems EVERONE love it. I sure do!

The Watiers are very attentive, and willing to get you whatever you need. Of course they're pineing for tips, but hey, they need to make a living too. And they were very nice!

All in all, I LOVE this place! My workmates do too. Oh, it DOES get VERY crowded around lunch time, so best time to go is BEFORE 11:30 AM, IF you can.

Please bear in mind that my review is only for the Teppanyaki grill stuff....NOT the Sushi. I have not yet had that, so my 5 Stars is for the grilled food. Just wanted to make that clear.
 
By far the best Asian GRILL place in Uptown!"}
{"text":"now, to be honest, i have only tried the sushi.  and i have only done that at lunch time whilst standing on one foot, hopping up and down and rubbing my tummy.  plus it is in the building adjacent to the one i work in, so it seems like it would be easy to pop out for a quick sushi fix at lunch.

my first time, was with my high school girlfriend my senior year.  we were both nervous... i mean, i was having lunch with a friend and we decided to dine in.

the line was long since we got there right around noon and they don't really have ample seating to handle their lunch crowd.  so you are sort of left with one of those \"college cafeteria, put your jacket on your chair while you order\" type of situations.

i ordered a spicy tuna and a spider roll, i think.  for as busy as it was, i understood the ten to fifteen minute wait to get our food.  most of my first soda was gone by then.  the rolls, for roughly $8-10 a pop, are relatively small.  like the diameter of a quarter.  the flavor wasn't bad, but it was nothing i would write japan about.

since then, i have tried it on a strictly take-out basis.  when this occurs, you are left standing in front of the small sushi bar that they make your rolls.... waiting.
the first time, it was again, a slammed lunch time, so i understood the ten to fifteen minute wait.  but this last go round, the place was maybe half full with no more than three people in line at a time.  and other than the seated patrons, nobody at the counter was really ordering sushi.

i seriously waited fifteen minutes for a spicy tuna roll the diameter of a quarter in eight half inch pieces and two pieces of salmon nigiri that were the size of bait.  and i got out of there for about twelve bucks.  seriously disappointing."}
{"text":"What a nice find! 

Prices for sushi range between $3 to $4 and no more than $5 for sashimi, which comes with three pieces. The assortment of rolls also generally fall between about $6 and $8. 

But be forewarned: The sizes are relatively small. Still, the menu boasts a nice selection of main, hibachi dishes and sizes, like mixed veggies ($2) and calamari ($5).

The wine list is short, though the Sean Minor Chardonnay was quite nice and perfectly chilled. 

The place has a slight cafeteria feel to it, but the low lighting at night and dark mahogany colored furniture helps. 

The staff are both helpful and cordial. The server twice returned to question my order -- something I appreciated. It's nothing like placing an order and having the chef guess what you meant, then serving you the wrong dish or offering. 

For those dining in, do not get confused by the register and to go counter. Just seat yourself. Honestly, the only aggravation is the music. I did not enjoy listening to Lady Gaga and Rhianna while I was trying to enjoy my spicy scallops and Rainbow Roll. Just not my thing. 

And I was surprised to find that the scallops were served on a dollop of rice. No exaggeration. It was a round bed of rice roughly the size of a half dollar. I thought it would be served as nigiri. Still, the scallops were quite fresh, soft and delicious."}
{"text":"After passing Hasaki every single day at work, I decided to give it a try for lunch. Monday through Friday they offer a lunch special: hibachi or teriyaki chicken meal with a spring roll and soda for only $9.95. I opted for the hibachi chicken. 

I ordered to-go and the meal was huge. Easily could feed two people, but I was hangry and scarfed it all down. The chicken was cooked perfect and had enough Seasoning glaze on it so that you didn't need extra sauce, however it comes with a side of white shrimp sauce. Can you say heaven?! This sauce is the game changer!! If you're extra naughty ask for two sauces. Trust me. The chicken was served with fried rice, mushrooms and sweet carrots (which was surprising, but good!). I did wish they mixed in some broccoli though...maybe I'll ask for it next time. 

Overall, great experience and I would definitely return again. This place is always busy so you know it's a good spot. If you work in uptown Hasaki is a must try!"}
{"text":"If you're walking by and starving to death or work across the street you may want to try this place.
The servers were very nice and it looks like a typical fast food joint.
I had the Steak Teriyaki. Came with fried rice- broccoli- carrots- I paid extra to sub onions and zucchini for the carrots. 
The dish came out looking very nice. The beef was not what I would call quality. I forgot my rule for inexpensive restaurants. Don't order beef or veal. The difference in quality is way to far apart. I usually stick with chicken because chicken breast is basically all the same. The fried rice was ok as well as the onions and zucchini. I think the broccoli was thrown in cold. The plate was VERY  bland.
My wife had the Crispy Roll that she received about 15 minutes after I got my dinner. She loved the roll."}
{"text":"Someone in back really knows how to make pho. It's just what I needed after a hard day's work and a previous night's drinking. The broth was flavored well, and the accompanying green leafies, jalapeno, lime and sprouts were right on.

The hibachi-style dish my dining companion had was pretty average, but tasty overall.  Prices were reasonable, and service was quick and very friendly. Decor is basic but contemporary, and the location is central to many downtown spots."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today the place is pretty clean and the price is what you would expect for uptown about 11.00 for lunch and drink. I tried to order steak and broccoli but they wouldn't let me substitute mushroom for broccoli. Instead I ordered the shrimp and broccoli the food came out very quickly which was great but the broccoli and the shrimp or still cold in the middle so obviously it was not cooked fresh or read it thoroughly. The server never came back to ask out of food was so I never got an opportunity to complain. I will probably go back here again because the flavors were good but next time I will make them we eat the food if it is cold and give them another bad review."}
{"text":"Wow I feel like I just got robbed! Someone in the back must have eaten half of my food and then the cashier sold me the other half! Wish they would've at least given me a discount :(. I've gotten good take out from here in the past, but this visit and my last they really skimped on the portions. Cutting costs is great and all but now I'm about to eat my girlfriends dinner too to make up for it. She blames me, I blame Hasaki."}
{"text":"The service is great.  The food is great.  Shrimp sauce amazing.   With that being said, the spicy tuna roll was the absolute worst ive ever had, and I eat a lot of tuna rolls!!"}
{"text":"I must first start off that I am going to be a little biased due to someone I know who works here. However, that won't help much. I came here for a birthday dinner and at first glance I thought this place was neatly decorated. A very fusion-esque place with contemporary lights and dining space with small bar and a couple of TV's. This is under the Ally building in Charlotte so automatically I think of it as a lunch spot for those daily city workers.

Anyways, for the appetizer I decided to order and try out their fried calamari. I'm a calamari fan and I wanted to see what this place could cook up. What came out was a little disappointing. Yes, the calamari was fried, however there was absolutely no flavor. It did come with a sauce that just reminded me of some kind of duck sauce for spring rolls with a hint of spice. It was nothing special to me.

Then for the entree I ordered the hibachi chicken with mushrooms. Yet again, nothing special. I felt the shrimp sauce was a little watery, it didn't seem like normal shrimp sauce with the nice flavor coming out of it. The portions were very weird, as there wasn't enough rice nor chicken. But, I guess it's because it's cheap. (I had to order the calamari after eating the entree because I finished it so fast) 

On the plus side, they were very nice and helpful with everything. The birthday girl had her fun and that was all that matters. In the end, this place is definitely a lunch place. Quick, in and out kind of dining that will get you back at the office."}
{"text":"If you're anything like me, you LOVE Chinese/Japanese food. Since I work in uptown, I've been on the hunt for a go-to place that can satisfy my need for Chinese/Japanese food. I can safely say, after trying a number of restaurants, Hasaki is my absolute fav. Their Lunch Special is ~$12, which is relatively of expensive, but totally worth. You get enough rice for two people, a really good portion of protein, delicious sweet carrots and \"Shrimp Sauce\" (which is like a white Yum Yum sauce). Gave Hasaki a 4/5 because it is what it is: a cheaper option that really hits a homerun when you have a craving. I have not had the sushi, or really anything else other than the Lunch Special, so I can't speak to the other offerings. 

The desk service is always great. They have always been friendly and quick. Even at the lunch rush, you can get in and out in under 10 minutes. I've dined in and taken out numerous times and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was in need of some good ol' habachi and obligatory shrimp sauce since being without it for quite some time now living in LA. A good friend of mine took me here and everything we had was absolutely delicious! From the sushi rolls to the nigiri, to the chicken and shrimp habachi - you can't go wrong. Service was excellent as well. I so wish Hasaki was in LA - we'd be regulars for sure! ;)"}
{"text":"The server was so nice and helpful. She really made the restaurant. She kept watch over us while we waited for a table. She was so sweet. She made sure they hurried our food since she knew we were going to the game. (Yes, I'm sure everyone in the restaurant was going to the game but she was trying her hardest to make it happen.)
The sushi was good. I recommend the Crunchy roll. 
Tonight was the GT & Florida game & every restaurant was packed. We got seated & our food very quickly. 
The prices were normal. $10-$15 for a roll."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times, close to where I live.  The grill has always been good, never disappointed.  Tried the Sushi Bar just recently, the Sushi Chef very helpful gave me a couple of recomendations.  Thank God, I went from ordinary to great.  The white tuna melted in my mouth.  I am hooked."}
{"text":"Great hibachi in uptown! My favorite is the hibachi steak; add zucchini and onions for fifty cents. I usually go there for take out and they are always quick and very pleasant. I have dined in a couple times and I appreciate the nice dishes and real flatware; rarely the case with other places.  This has become a frequent visit for me."}
{"text":"We tried a little bit of everything and were very impressed! The portions were large and everything tasted fresh! Our server was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is solid, portion sizes are not.  Pretty small sizes for the price"}
{"text":"I found this gem through yelp and we tried it out for my birthday.  It wasn't busy when we arrived at 7 on a Saturday night.  Parking was difficult but there is a deck near by.  Their shrimp sauce is amazing and I could eat it on everything! Shrimp sauce for days! I ordered the 4 oz filet with scallops from the dinner menu. My typical go to at a Japanese restaurant. Steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare.  It came with a choice of miso soup or salad.  I opted for the salad with ginger dressing. Another personal fav of mine.!!the entree came with vegetables and rice and was all delicious. The steak was almost buttery and was divine. The 375ml bottle of sake was $20 which I thought was a little expensive  and wouldn't order it again. I really enjoyed this restaurant and would like to go back. Will probably order the filet and jumbo shrimp next time because I only got three very small scallops with my meal.  Someone else ordered the shrimp and their plate was overflowing with tasty looking shrimp. 
Downgraded the restaurant just because their bathroom is the equivalent of a gas station bathroom. Door didn't lock and it opened up right into the main dining area.  The waitress was super friendly, attentive, we answered all our questions about the menu. I will be back!!"}

Hasaki is a family favorite. We know exactly what to expect and we are always satisfied. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. Variety of sushi in the menu, along with many other food choices. There's also gluten free options."}
{"text":"Great prices and well maintained. Too many staff chilling in the dining room which makes it uncomfortable to eat. Got the Chicken Teriyaki, nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The food exceeded my expectations. Had the hibachi chicken w/ zucchini. Very good. Made to order and very inexpensive for uptown lunch. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their sushi was great! Would definitely recommend the rolls we got- spicy tuna, california, hornets, and spider. We had a tough time deciding because they all sounded good, so we will definitely be back go try other rolls!"}

Hibachi!
Teriyaki!
Pho! Noodles!
Sushi!
Sake!
Ice Cream!

One stop shop!!! ^_^"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always go here if I want Japanese. The food always comes quickly and the staff is GREAT! So welcoming and caring."}
{"text":"I love this place the food was great and the staff was friendly and full
Of jokes. I will be back"}
{"text":"I have treated myself to lunch at Hasaki at least a dozen times since I've been working uptown. It's reliable, tasty, filling, and affordable. The counter staff and servers are always kind and pleasant to interact with. Even better (for me) is that many of my friends and coworkers frequent Hasaki, so it's always filled with friendly faces.

I've tried a handful of things on the menu, but I always seem to come back to the hibachi shrimp and broccoli. I swap out the fried rice for brown rice to keep my meal gluten free, and once it arrives I cover the whole plate in shrimp sauce. My rice, my protein, my broccoli, my carrots -- everything is better with shrimp sauce.

I can't speak to the sushi. In fact, I'm not sure that many people can. Over all of my visits to Hasaki, I could count on one hand the amount of times I've seen sushi in the dining room.

Hasaki is always steady, but depending on the day, it can really get slammed around lunchtime. If you're in a rush, call ahead. Sometimes even ordering take-out can take awhile, so hedge your bets if you're on a tight schedule. I can say, though, that even when this spot is overflowing with people, you're served with a smile. It's consistently a positive experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of the pictures and reviews. I see how this place has potential and maybe it's just an of day but my grievance isn't with that. 

I got the house salad with ginger dressing. The ginger dressing is some of the best I've ever had. Ever!!! So I'll give them another star for that (initially one star). The salad itself was not fresh. My lettuce was browning on the edges and was not green. It was like older iceberg lettuce. I have no problem with iceberg, I love it just as much as spring mix, and it goes best with ginger dressing , but is best when it's fresh!

I chose the scallop hibachi with carrots and broccoli because I live sweet carrots. The hibachi is okay... Maybe I shouldve gotten chicken or shrimp. I was very disappointed when my plate came out with one scallop that was clearly cut into pieces. Sheesh they could have at least gave me two or three whole scallops, or serve baby scallops. After getting over the scallop ordeal, I started to eat my veggies only to find they were cold. At least they didn't give me a problem about asking for hot veggies. 

The other items may be good, and idk if I'll come back to find out. People seem to like this place for lunch so maybe it's just an isolated incident. Overall I was disappointed with a lunch I was looking forward to enjoying."}
{"text":"To put it plainly, If I had to pick a last meal, it would be from this place. No joke. Not only is the food out of this world, it is SUPER cheap. The sushi is the best I've had (try the panther roll!) and the hibachi chicken and steak will make you cry tears of happiness. Remember when you got married and you cried because you were so happy? Well this is a better feeling than that.."}
{"text":"Sushi was disappointing in flavor as well as size. If you like good sushi, I would not suggest going here. However, after the sushi we decided to get some hibachi and it was wonderful. Good service."}
{"text":"So it was a take out night one recent cold rainy night...

They were quick......affordable....friendly...and I had a cold beer while I waited.

Continues to be a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Using gps to find this place, it is the shop next to the revolving doors with red umbrellas. 

My very first impression of this restaurant:
It was extremely clean. Being a safe serve manager, I was disappointed my table was sticky, their lemons by their self serve soda machine you could tell have been sitting there for hours. I was disappointed to see it looked like owners young daughter running around the back with her hair not tied back sitting on counters. She appeared young, however, no one was telling her \"no\" or to wash her hands whenever she went behind the counters. 

Food wise: 
Above average for your typical Americanized Japanese style food. Fair portions to the price. And my hibachi style chicken was delish!
And presentation was simple. 

Service wise:
Excellent service, the young gentleman person at the register was kind and patient. Very formal. And the lady who delivered out food was kind."}
{"text":"Great for a quick hibachi lunch. They don't take Amex so that is a bummer for all the business travelers with corporate cards. Food is actually good also!"}
{"text":"The fucking guiltiest lunch pleasure a guy could ask for. So far from authentic Japanese, it's laughable; but, it's so freakin delicious I can't help but love it.

Here's the deal: you get hibachi or teriyaki style grilled meat and/or vegetables. Everything comes with a creamy shrimp sauce (one little container's probably 500 calories alone), rice, and these sweet carrot slices that are filled with ecstasy or some shit. Seriously, they're so damn good, you'd think you're at a rave making out with a blob of indigo that transforms itself into Scarlett Johansson.

Buyer be warned: this food's heavy, yo. If you eat everything on your plate, it's the equivalent of going to Chipotle. Try going back to work with that food baby. No, thanks. That's why I always order the fried veggies; with rice, carrots and shrimp sauce, it's the perfect amount of food.

Regarding the sushi: avoid that shit. Just don't.

Great service, family owned and run. Check it out for lunch; you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times for lunch. Not bad for under $10. Haven't tried the sushi yet. Teriyaki and hibachi chicken are good and comes with shrimp sauce that I tend to eat way to much of."}
{"text":"It still amazes me how much food these hibachi places turns out in the amount of time.  The Hasaki Grill is no exception.  Located right in uptown in the Ally Building, its a great lunch option if you work in the area.  I'm sure it's a solid option for dinner as well, but I am not sure about the parking situation since I walk everywhere during the day.

I usually get their Lunch Special since it includes a fountain drink and spring roll.  You can also get sushi here at a small sushi bar, but I have never tried it.

The dining room is large with high ceilings... a big space with lots of tables.  There are a couple of booths (that need a little TLC)... They are worn and some of the fabric is tearing - it's a good sign of the amount of people this restaurant services.

Staff is very efficient and friendly.  Once you order at the counter, they give you a number and will bring out your food to you with silverware.  They will also take/clear the table, so you are well taken care of."}
{"text":"I am new to Charlotte and a Sushi fanatic. Having gone to multiple sushi hotspots, I found that even though there are sushi restaurants everywhere, the quality and presentation for the most part were only so-so. THAT IS, UNTIL I FOUND HASAKI!! Every single roll I ordered, came out looking like a work of flawless art, even the sashimi!! Every single thing I've tasted has  been top notch! I have been going every week and sometimes multiple times a week and I love trying new rolls. The Panther and Bank Roll are my favorites!! The sushi Chef Lolo is so talented and passionate about his line of work. Don't see what you like? Ask him, he'll make it happen."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for \"authentic\" Japanese food....served fast, but not fast food. To be uptown, the prices a very reasonable....even the sushi! The \"all day\" menu rocks!!! Not just lunch prices that end at 4....all day!! I like to substitute onions and zucchini for the carrots....but whats good is you can swap out broccoli and mushrooms on the entrees as well. Whatever you like! The sushi is very good. I like Rock-N-Roll and the Volcano Roll. Never had a bad experience....well, except when I see all the receipts I have laying around...lol!!"}
{"text":"The Venue: This place definitely seems like more of a lunch spot to me than a restaurant. It was clean but very cold...my lips were actually turning bluish at the end of the meal. 

The Sushi:  All the sushi tasted good (we had the bobcat, cherry, crunchy, and rainbow). I enjoyed all but I didn't feel like the bobcat roll warranted the $2 extra as it wasn't any larger than the other rolls and didn't have more substance. The rolls are pretty small here, we were able to finish all four between the two of us without a problem. I would stick to the cheaper rolls $8 and under. They do not have any big specialty rolls, everything was pretty basic. The quality of the fish was fresh though slices were thin and I abhor chopped tuna. 

The Staff: The food took quite a long time to prepare despite the restaurant being empty. In fact we had it delivered to us in two different rounds which was a little odd. Our server was not knowledgeable and couldn't tell us what was on top of our roll (we figured out it was tuna...chopped and pressed together to look like a solid piece). We also sat drinkless for quite sometime...again, the place had perhaps 2 other tables seated. 

Verdict: For cheap sushi K.O is better  in my opinion though they don't have seating.If it's a special occasion or you want to be wowed I would try elsewhere. Overall though I would come back as it was fresh and a safe bet for inexpensive sushi, no unpleasant fishy flavors here!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a big lunch for a reasonable price. Typical hibachi-style lunch and the line moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Went during lunch and boy was it packed but the cashier was fast and efficient. She took our order right away. Got our food in like 10 minutes. I got the chicken hibachi and it was really good. It came with sweet carrots that I loved. Too bad you only got a few pieces of it. Next time I'll have to ask for more carrots. They gave you a good amount of shrimp sauce as well but the food didn't need any extra sauce or seasoning because I thought it was just right. They had great sweet tea. Had to take a cup to go. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Warning: this place gets crazy busy at lunch during the work week.  I recommend going earlier than 11:30 or calling it in to go!  

This is fast food Japanese at its finest!  The portions are generous.

I special order my food to have extra veggies and chicken (no rice) to make it healthier (see pic).  It's always fresh and delicious.  

They have a little patio outside if it's nice weather.  You could even get it to go and sit outside and eat."}
{"text":"Nice little place that is clean and fresh.  Had a fair market value menu that had the essentially. I ordered several different items and was pleased with each one.  So I challenged them to make my plain white sticky rice more interesting.  They responded by bringing me a platter of fresh cut and stir fried veggies in a delicate brown sauce.  Well played Asian Chef Master.  They offer sit down and take away counter ordering so meets demands of city workers and tourists looking for a quick quality meal."}
{"text":"Lunch go to, especially for take out. Quick delicious hibachi lunches with your choice of protein, steamed broccoli and sweet carrots. The sauce is the best on the rice. Steak has the most flavor but chicken is good too, especially with the dipping sauce. Order at the counter, get a number and sit down or wait for the to go package."}
{"text":"If I lived next door at the Catalyst, I would be in some serious trouble. Why? Well, I would probably come over here every day and get something covered in shrimp sauce. Shrimp sauce makes everything better.

My good friends Andrea and Jason have told me about this place for awhile. They are here pretty much every week. So, I finally ventured here with them on Saturday.

The all day menu seems like the no-brainer option here. I ordered hibachi shrimp and zucchini & onions for the sweet carrots. It's 50 cents to swap them. I also went with a tom yum soup since it was a special that day. Hibachi, soup and coke = $14. Not bad at all. I ended up eating part of it the next day for lunch. Hasaki also has a sushi menu, a couple noodle options and dessert. I have to come back and see what this fried ice cream is all about. 

Our served was really young, but she was super sweet and attentive. Hasaki seems to do a lot of take out orders. Several people were in and out during our meal to pick up food.

Parking options: the Catalyst has a pay garage. Check for street parking. It's free on the weekends and after 6pm on week nights.

I'll definitely back. This may be a new affordable hibachi go-to spot for me."}
{"text":"utterly the best Japanese hibachi place in uptown charlotte!  I have been here 3 times with my coworkers and we all love it! 

Reasons why you should indulge on this place:
1) super cheap and affordable! under $10 easily with tax and no tip needed
2) efficient service! super fast and nice wait staff!
3) the steak and scallop are so tender and enormous (scallops) this meal is about $12 but if u just get the steak meal is under $10
4) I hate carrots but the sweet carrots here are like candy so delicious! 

will definitely be back here.  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid spot on the lunch train, and unless I'm just a silly pants blind person, the only location with what I like to call \"Japanese Fast Food\".  You know, the kind of place where they just KNOW everyone's going to pour the \"shrimp sauce\" all over everything, so they give you a nice big plastic thing of it.  I did not partake in the hibachi menu, had some sushi and a garden salad (with that delicious sesame ginger dressing that really only tastes right from a place like this).  Sushi isn't the best in the world, but it's not grocery store quality either.  Salad was fresh and crunchy, and I like the challenge of eating salad with chopsticks.  A nice addition to the uptown lunch choices, and since I'm across the street, it's just the right amount of walking in the sun from one place to the next.  All in all, a solid spot.  Gets a bid loud at the peak of lunchtime though!  Bring a megaphone, or be a loudmouth like me."}
{"text":"This was by far the most disgusting sushi I have ever had. I ordered the volcano roll (somethings I order at every sushi restaurant because I always like it) and it was tiny and very rubbery. The guy at the table across from us found a hair in his fried rice. Ours was mostly pepper and no other seasonings. If you really want to try this place, only order the dumplings and edamame. They were the only edible things we had."}
{"text":"Panther roll is amazing and the staff is always very pleasant! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for sushi uptown."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Chicken hibachi I've ever eaten.  The chicken was amazingly tender and the carrots were sweet and perfect.  

We also had sushi, which was fresh and wrapped tightly.

Service was fast and kind.  This place is a new favorite1"}
{"text":"I'd eaten here for dinner in the past and decided to try them for lunch.  During lunch you order at the counter.  I was surprised that even though they were semi-busy, our food came out a lot faster than I expected.  The staff was very welcoming and kindly answered a couple of questions that I had about the menu.  

In our group we each ordered different plates and all really loved every bit of our food.  I ordered the chicken and mushrooms, the plate came with rice and the sweetest, best carrots that I've ever had.  The chicken breast was very juicy. Who can forget the amazing SHRIMP SAUCE !!

A  member in our group had the steak and shrimp, it too came with carrots and rice.  Another member of our group had the broccoli and shrimp, rice and carrots.  I felt that their pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food and service that you get.   

Side note - their sweet tea is SUPER, SUPER Sweet...be sure to half and half it.  

The staff checked on us multiple times but were not overbearing.  A lady, who I assume is the owner was so sweet.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"went today for a brief lunch date.

both had the Hibachi chicken w/ mushrooms... other had Hibachi chicken w/ broccolli.

only a few other ppl in there at the time. We walked up ordered and recieved the HOT food in about 7 mins. Maybe less. 

Food was ok. nothing special. 
I'll try something else different the next time, see if it gets better."}
{"text":"Food is good, a little expensive, particularly for lunch.  Very crowded during lunch and there is a very long wait (hence three stars) and no seating.  You're just sort of 'en masse' with a bunch of other business people waiting if you go for takeout.  I still go on occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place for quick hibachi! They are always so quick and the food has always been consistent!  Best hibachi in CLT."}
{"text":"Strong performance. Found this place by accident last week when going to Mellow Mushroom, which left much to be desired. I was much happier here. However, it wasn't a home run. As is the case with most restaurants, a lot will depend on what you order. So ... I hope I can be of some assistance. 

The Teriyaki Chicken Skewers on the Appetizers menu are awesome. Highly recommended! 

The Japanese Noodles on the Appetizers menu start out tasting a bit bland, but the taste grows on you as you eat. I'm not sure how or why this happened, but those are the facts. Therefore, I recommend the Japanese Noodles. 

The Teriyaki Steak was on the boring side. There wasn't much taste. This dish came with rice and carrots. The rice was good yet not exceptional; the carrots were excellent. 

This place is easy to find, and parking is easy and free if you visit Charlotte on the weekend. The dining area was also spotless. The \"Clean Score\" was 97.5, which means the kitchen is cleaner than most restaurants -- always a good sign. 

The service was friendly and reliable for the most part. The only negative was when we were done; the entire staff was on their phones and not looking up. I had to walk up to the register, but no big deal. This didn't impact the rating. The reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is the borderline tasteless Teriyaki Steak. If I had only gotten the Teriyaki Chicken Skewers and Japanese Noodles from the Appetizers menu, then it might have been a 5. Probably 4.5."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and affordable.   Great value for uptown. 

Try their $10 lunch includes spring roll and drink. 

Great sush. Great Hibach.   Check em out."}
{"text":"This place is great! A good deal on hibachi for lunch uptown. The sushi special is also awesome. My only gripe is that the line get super long during lunch on weekdays and it gets very loud also. Probably best to take out."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is like a place in the mall. It is good and affordable. 

You are not going to get some big glam taste that you would get at other places. 

It is tasty and good for a quick lunch or dinner. I can see how this place could be a local favorite."}
{"text":"I found it!!  Everybody, swarm swarm swarm!!  The best take out Uptown!!  Only after searching the streets of Charlotte for over a year, did I find Hasaki.  Well, to be honest they only opened like a month a go but you know what I'm saying.  Let me get right into it and I will get the only issue right out of the way.

Location/Decor - 4/5:  They are right down the street from the French Quarter going towards the BofA Stadium.  It would be better, for their sake, if they were on the Trade/Tryon Strip but whatever.  Right next door to the new American Grill (ironic huh?).  The sit down area is nice but not \"fancy restaurant\" style at all.  More like casual and comfy.  

Service - 5/5:  Do you want it in 5 minute or 30 minute.  It doesn't matter!  They are fast and good at what they do.  Also, the lady at the cash register speaks gooder english than me do so no problem (Sorry, just jokes).  She is so sweet and took the time to talk to me about the whole menu.  

Portion/Price - 6/5:  You read that right... 6 out of 5.  Huge portions.  I am a big eater (run triathlons) and I need my calories but oh lordy Lord.  The hibachi COMBO platter is enough food for two and is around $11.  But trust me when I say that you only need the single entree and you will be satisfied ($6-$8).

Shrimp Sauce - 5/5:  First let me say, that I hate HATE mayonnaise.  Having said that.... I love this shrimp sauce.  I got an extra one and used it the next day on some quinoa.  Hells yeah..  Something made out of mayo that counters my hatred for mayo is something special.  Trust me and give this place a try. 

Oh yeah... Only got the Shrimp Tempura roll once and it was scrumptious..  ENJOY!!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"I love this spot!! The whole staff is sweet and very accommodating!! Came in with a large party 40 minutes before they closed! Not only did they served us great tasting food they also stayed open an extra 30 minutes to let us eat our food in peace!! Now that's great customer service!! Their sushi is great, the udon soup is decent but the tempura is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Florida and a friend of mine recommended this place.  It was so good my wife and I ate lunch there and had a wonderful experience. Not over priced and the service was very pleasant. If I lived up here I would go back over and over."}
{"text":"Let me just say even though they don't promote their sushi like they should it is amazing !!!!!!!!! Sooo fresh ! You can deff taste the difference in quality! Try the Bobcats roll !"}
{"text":"Great service! Ben is such a hard worker, he made sure I had everything I needed. The food was phenomenal! I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews, I was not overly impressed by anything at Hasaki Grill on this quiet Friday evening.  The music was too loud and not because it was not my flavor.  The waiter, bless his heart, had no idea what to do or say.  He said too much but yet did not ask enough questions.  No water was offered, which I accept as the new \"thing\".  However, once he brought over the appetizers, he failed to bring plates, silverware, or napkins.  I applaud the business for creating jobs, but please know that you must provide minimal training.  It might help to send the staff to other establishments to see how it is or isn't done.  I am not going to knock him too bad for his lack of service because I am really happy he has a job, for now.  Moving on to the food, the shrimp appetizer was artfully arranged and the shrimp was tasty; however, we had to request silverware and ginger sauce to make use of the ample serving of lettuce and carrots that was served with the appetizer.  My entree, shrimp with broccoli (served with fried rice and sweet carrots) was nothing special.  The wine list is very limited and as expected, the waiter was unable to offer any suggestions as they had recently received their liquor license.  It is my guess that the Uptown lunch crowd may keep this restaurant in business as only two other tables were occupied in the tastefully decorated restaurant.  I will make another visit to Hasaki to check out the sushi - hopefully, it will not disappoint...and I will gladly update this review at that time."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Japanese food. Such good teriyaki chicken. Check it out if you are uptown. You won't be disappointed. Gets busy around noon during the week so go early or late. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Don't you love those cold rainy days? Convenience is worth the extra buck. When you work right upstairs, nothing like hopping on the elevator walking 25 ft and ordering some good cheap eats.

While it might seem high end from the exterior, Hasaki is a take out kinda place with dishes ranging in the $7 range. Quite affordable, great portions but what the hell are sweet carrots?

My only complaint is the lack of veggies. I wish these hibachi places would just offer a veggie medley. Is it too much to ask for broccoli, mushrooms and zucchini?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 specialty rolls for takeout: Panther and Cherry Blossom. The Panther roll was really delicious and was definitely the better of the two. The sauces were abundant and very flavorful.

On the other hand, I found the Cherry Blossom roll to be rather dull. The tuna on top was a nice touch and distinguished this roll from other cherry blossom rolls I've had elsewhere, but I felt it would have benefitted from drizzling a little sauce on top.

There weren't many unique specialty rolls to choose from, so I'm not really tempted to come back to try anything else. And as good as the Panther roll was, the Philly Melt roll at Fujo is very similar and comes with 12 pieces instead of just 10. I would give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Note to business travelers: they don't take AMEX.

I ordered chicken teriyaki with broccoli, spring rolls, and salad.

Found the chicken teriyaki bland, but broccoli was well cooked. The stewed carrots that came with were not appetizing.

I don't believe the spring rolls were fresh or made on site. Deep, deep fried.

The salad was good--as you'd expect. Iceberg lettuce but the ginger dressing was tasty.

Service was very good, attentive, fast, and they attempted to fix my order when they forgot to substitute brown rice."}
