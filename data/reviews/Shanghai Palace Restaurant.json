{"text":"\"Xie Xie\" Shanghai! - Soooo Gooood!!! Have been here several times and have never been disappointed. The portion size is good, prices are fair, and most importantly, the flavours are always tasty. When here with the Chan Clan, it was a huge meal comprised of double digit courses; from starter (Light Veggie Soup) to dessert (Fruit Tapioca), all good. Most recently, it was JuDo and her entourage, we had the Crispy Garlic Chicken, Peking Style Pork Chops, Garlic Pea Shoots, and S&P Squid; it was all yumma. Most importantly, however, no MSG headache-dry mouth/throat-lethargy after the meal. The room isn't huge, but it's spacious enough without feeling that the table next to you is actually dining with you. Of course, it being a Chinese resto, it's a bit noisy and animated, kind of like riding mass transit with the two super cute elderly Chinese ladies who talk to each other from opposite ends of the bus! There's lots of Chinese cuisine in the city, but not much in the way of quality and affordability, so don't get \"Shanghaied\" and check out this Shanghai surprise."}
{"text":"Not great. Food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold. Can't really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food.  Save your calories for something else."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here before. The food has been ok. My last order I ordered over $100 of takeout but was missing the salt and pepper squid. I phoned to to tell them. The lady who answered says her friend put it on top. I did not get the squid yet she is telling me her friend put it on top. Please check the order before you leave! I will never order from them again. I do not like liars and dishonest people. Very sad when that happens."}
{"text":"No more lunch buffet though the equipment is still there. New chairs and tablecloths. Maybe new owners?   The lunch specials were similar to mall Chinese food other than a huge serving of rice and a very good hot and sour soup.   Too bad."}
{"text":"Nice food, very friendly staff. We got the Peking duck combo. The duck was really good. The skin was crispy and meat was quite soft. Although in Beijing, the duck would be sliced much thinner, the overall quality is quite good. We had Peking duck a few years ago in Toronto. The taste is comparable."}
{"text":"Very disappointed . I explicitly ordered a wonton noodle soup and she even double checked with me but i still ended up with a chicken noodle soup. Doesnt sound like a big deal but their customer service is also terrible."}
{"text":"I have found some pretty good Singapore noodles in Calgary thus far but these may be the best I have had here.   Came in to try for the first time on a weeknight (Tues is Senior`s Day if that applies to you, save 10%!) and it was busy enough with take out orders in the early evening hours. The restaurant was clean and the ladies working there were smiley and very friendly. There is a lunch buffet that goes on daily until 3pm and the woman proudly boasted that their Singapore noodles were included in the buffet and was one of their best sellers! Sweet! Good to know. The food took your standard 10 minutes and you are welcome to have a seat in the restaurant at a table until the food comes out. Keeps well, ate it about 45 min later at home. We also got the wonton soup which is not overly seasoned as some places really manager to bugger it up with too much salt. The wontons were fresh tasting with a bite to them and not gummy whatsoever. Lots of parking in the lot. I like its location in the plaza, on the corner. If you are not sure where to find this place on Country Hills Blvd, look for the Superstore. THAT, you cannot miss. SO glad we found this  place in the NW and without having read any Yelp reviews on it prior, it was a fantastic gamble. Will be back again and again. They have a boxed lunch for $8.95 and a dinner for 1 we will get next time to share. Great value and reads as a ton of food for $16.95 with your choice of a few things."}
{"text":"We were told this place was pretty good. We ordered a couple dishes; sweet & sour pork, rice, garlic green beans, dumplings. All was good - nothing AMAZING - but it was good predictable Chinese food. Huge selections menu but my dinner partner did not like spicy so it did limit the selection. Staff very helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this place once or twice in the past 5-7 years.  This place never really left an impression on me.  I can here again, this time with my family for dinner.  The place is surprisingly packed with people...suprised because this is not one of my top choices for Chinese food in the area.  The food came quite fast and the portions were decent.  The quality of the food really depends on which one you get.  The sweet and sour pork was not great... there was a slightly odd taste in the fried pork that most likely due to the batter used.  As a result I only ate two pieces.   The rest of the dishes were ok.  The Gai Lan was cooked really well actually.  We were pretty full by the end the dinner.  Overall it is good value for the amount of food, but there are probably other slightly better options in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, everyone is so helpful with the menu. The food is fresh and delicious. The flavors are so unique for each dish. Not like some chinese joints where everything kind of tastes the same... We ordered a la carte so I cant comment on their daily lunch buffet, I'll be trying that next time."}
{"text":"Over the last few years we've ordered take out from here several time and have always been pleased. The service and delivery are always really quick, the food arrives nice and hot, the food is tasty, and the prices seem good, especially for the amount of food you get.  We usually get mushroom fried rice, spring rolls, mixed vegetable noodles, and stir fried mixed vegetables in garlic sauce, so I can't comment on anything else, but the things we get have always been good.  We definitely plan to order from here again...tomorrow night in fact!"}
{"text":"I am super stuffed; it is Chinese New Years and my cousin's restaurant of choice is the Shangai Palace.  Not an empty seat in the whole restaurant tonight, and our 13 person family table certainly didn't help matters.  But let me tell you, we had a feast, an absolutely amazing feast; the only thing lacking was if we had actually eaten this on a candlelit table under a clear night outside in Shangai!  We started with an amazing Peking duck which was so perfect.  It was sliced thinly with just enough crunchy skin to insert into our tortillas with that spicy sweet sauce.    Second course were two types of shrimp, one with some mayonnaise dressing, which I felt was too rich and a sweet and sour version. Course 3, sweet and sour pork, with fresh cucumber, sliced carrots, this was a huge portion, and in fact all plates were huge.  Course 4, a nice sour soup with crab, the remains of our duck and shitake mushrooms, by this point I was certainly getting full  Course 5, a whole fish, nicely steamed, with tons of herbs and lemon.  Course 6, a noodle dish, after all noodles in Phillipino represent long life.  Course 7, abalone and huge mushroom caps the size of my palm, these were amazing, so fresh and so succulent  Course 8, crab and lobster, this came with nut cracking thongs so you could really get yourself dirty.  Course 9 Cruncy tender chicken, this was just as good as the duck and super tasty.  According to my nephew rice is place on the table at the end of the meal so that the chef knows that he has done well, but we are a Filipino family and this was demanded around course 4.  Wait there is more, during the whole meal, our waters and Chinese teas were frequently filled, the wait staff was amazing, we rounded everything off with the desert buffet.  There was jello, and smiling fortune cookies and a mocha layered cake.  By this point, they had to roll me to my car, and I swear a couple of people mistook my tummy for Buddha's and rubbed it.  I did not know the total, my cousin is very discreet all I know is at the Shangai palace it is the next best thing to being in Shangai."}
{"text":"Went here for a special occasion. Service was terrible and the food was even worse. Ginger Beef had no taste, prawns rubbery and broccoli under cooked, the chow mein  was horrific. I don't even think it was really chicken in this dish, that's how bad it was.  We were totally disappointed. Then they had the nerve to ask if we were leaving a tip. Don't go here and waste your money and time."}
{"text":"I was pretty please with their food and services. My family and I went here for my dad's 60th b-day. We ordered honey garlic chicken, fried shrimp and fish with salty egg yolk, steam fish with scallion and ginger in soy sauce and a lot more, I forgot cuz I think we order too much. It all came out great. Also if I am not mistaken they have a little buffet session too for those who want Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Went here as a referral from a friend.  Walked in for take-out and the restaurant is busy for dinner service.  The menu has quite a selection and love the discounts given at take-out.  I couldn't believe it only took about 10 minutes for my order.  Quick and efficient!    I ordered the ginger beef, lemon chicken, cantonese chow mein and two orders of steamed rice.  Portions were nice and the food kept nice and hot while on the drive home.    Ginger beef could have used a bit more spice and sauce and I wanted the cantonese chow mein with crispy noodles but was still ok.  Will be back as it's one of the few good chinese places in the NW."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Steer clear if you want to be treated with any respect. She actually hung up on me after our few second \"conversation\". I didn't get a chance to have my question (which was simple and polite) answered. I phoned back and she again hung up on me. I promise I did nothing to deserve that treatment."}
{"text":"Here's my review of Shanghai Palace's lunch buffet.  They have a small salad bar, the hot food items include spring rolls, wonton soup, hot n sour soup,  fried chicken (lightly salted), potstickers, beef or chicken and long beans in black bean sauce, salt & pepper squid (one of the best I've ever had!), fried rice, 2 types of fried noodles, ginger beef (nicely cooked up!),  stir-fied vegetables, desserts include jello and Chinese cookies.    I really like this buffet as they cook in small portions and bring the food out and they always keep the containers filled.  The food is always freshly cooked.  The S&P squid is to die for!  The deep-fried chicken is not always on at the buffet but it's such a treat to find it in the buffet.  Shanghai Palace also has a dinner buffet."}
