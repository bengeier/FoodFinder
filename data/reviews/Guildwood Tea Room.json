{"text":"A very cozy, nice tearoom that is beautifully designed, I decided to go here on a whim with my boyfriend for lunch and tea. The food was absolutely splendid and they have a nice selection of high quality loose leaf teas.

I had the Shepard's pie, which was amazing and though the portion looked small, it was quite filling. Along with the pie I had the organic hojicha green tea. What can I say about the tea other than it was high quality loose leaf tea, imported from Japan. Truly splendid. My boyfriend had the cowboy quiche which was made with bacon and cheddar, I believe. It was his first time eating quiche and he enjoyed it very much.

For dessert I had the brownie, though I did not enjoy it as much as the Shepard's pie. It was not as moist as I'd expected and was much too heavy for me. I did not like the frosting they added on top of the brownie, it was too hard.

Service was good, though our server did not have a proper menu as the place has only been open for a couple of months. Our server did not know the specials of the day and had to keep looking at the board. Aside from that, everything was wonderful. I would definitely go back and I would definitely recommend my friends to come too."}
{"text":"We are so excited that the Guildwood Tea Room is finally open.  We went here for lunch (and tea) the other day, and had a great time!  They have a great selection of teas, and their bread was delicious.  They also have free Wifi and are \"baby friendly\"!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing little place hidden away! Our server Sarah was friendly, knowledgeable and a hoot! She made great recommendations and  knew what we needed before we asked. 

They had a great selection of teas to suit everybody. And delicious savoury and sweet treats to complement the selection.

The ambience was very old English. I felt transported to my grandma's tea room but in a good way. Loved that they try to make it feel authentic. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is a great little place close to the Scarborough bluffs.  We found it when looking for some place for a snack after a visit to the Guild Inn.  
There is definitely room for improvement, but I really liked this place and will go again.  Here's how they can improve:  better service, ie we sat too long with menus and no attention.  I think standards suggest a max 2 min wait after the menus arrive...at least to check in.  Ours was longer, and that suggests not enough service staff.
Also..a pet peeve of mine, is that staff in the back room do not come out wearing big honking headphones! Clearly they don't want to help customers.
Food- I had cream tea.  Scone was too small, but the tea was great, although their timing as terribly off. I basically ate the entire scone BEFORE the tea even came!
My partner had bangers and mash.  Very tasty
Try it..it is very nice,and I hope they read the review so they know how to improve their establishment.

I will update the review if I see improvements."}
{"text":"When I think of the perfect place for a special occasion, where I know we will be consistently delighted with food, service and decor, I think of the Guildwood Tearoom. The owners Janice and Richard know the true meaning of hospitality. Their wait staff Laura and Sarah are very efficient, yet absolutely personable. In addition to the regular menu, Richard creates seasonal soups, desserts, and other dishes that are exquisite and often gluten free. I love the eclectic assortment of beautiful tea cups, and dishes. The tea menu has a wonderful variety of high quality teas from around the world. I have tried most everything from the regular menu and without hesitation, would highly recommend The Guildwood Tearoom to anyone looking for a welcoming venue that embraces the highest of culinary standards."}
{"text":"This is a quiet and nice tea to located in guildwood in Scarborough. Great, friendly service and great tea and food. They serve crepes, pies, and desert along with other foods and several dozen choices of tea. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my time visiting there and I am sad to see it close down. If anyone has news of a reopening please post it and spread the word."}
{"text":"Small and out of the way, but well worth it to visit the Tea Room. My wife has been taking her friends their of months. Finally I got my chance to visit the restaurant. I was impressed with the menu. They offer a small, however interesting selection of items that will please most anyone. The food is made fresh and is tasty. 

Lunch time is busy, yet the service was exceptional. It's a good idea to make reservations"}
{"text":"I had the delight of going to this place by chance when I was brought along with some friends. Overall worth a visit. 

To start off they bring you a tea menu. 3 full pages on equating to if I recall correctly 56 different types of tea. Service was a little slow because their bakery chef was feeling ill so the co-owner (I believe) took her home personally. So I can't blame them at all. After we got our tea however everything was on track. 

They start you off with a small bowl of diced strawberries in some sauce topped with whipped cream, after which they bring you the standard 'tea time' sandwiches and scones which are:
-2 Cheddar and Pickle
-2 Egg Salad
-2 Chicken Salad 
-1 Cucumber and Dill
-1 Three Cheese Scone
-1 Blueberry scone.

All delicious and topped with a variety of filling deserts.

Lastly, I always check the bathrooms when I know I'll be leaving a review of the place. There are two bathrooms, one regular and one for the disabled. They are both shared and very, very clean. 

I would come here again it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Their website proudly announces, \"FINALLY WE'RE OPEN\", and I have to say that it was worth the wait! This tea room's olde, English interior was created from the ground up by 1 man with an obvious obsession for details--even the washroom was a treat to visit! Definitely worthy of a visit; the popularity with the Guildwood residents + limited seating = reservations recommended. We do dare declare, Downton Abbey-esque tea room in the heart of Guildwood...!

Chicken Pot Pie, Quiche ('mini-entrees' include bread & whipped butter), 2 sweets, and a pot of Buckingham Palace tea for two people came up to ~$28"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had tea and lunch here and loved it. Initially we went in for just for tea, not knowing they did lunch too. I had a lovely Brie-leek quiche with salad, and BF had the shepherds pie. Both were delicious.  The choice of teas is very impressive! Beautifully prepared and presented in the Traditional way.  Delightful English tea house yet has a friendly neighbourly vibe.  We will visit again and highly recommend it to those in the area, and those venturing off the beaten track."}
{"text":"I have been to the Guildwood Tea Room several times, 3 times for high tea and once to order off their regular menu. 
Last time I was there the service was not as good as the previous times. the owner had mixed up our reservations for high tea, but in the end everything worked out fine.
The food is always delicious and I particularly like Sarah as a server. She is very friendly and helpful. Well worth the price for high tea!"}
{"text":"It is NOT closed!  Oh this place!  Oh! Oh!  Oh!  I did not think I liked tea.  I did not think I like little sandwiches and such but this place changed all that!  The selection of teas is amazing!  I recommend the Herbs de Provence and the Lapsong (smoky flavour).  We have been a few times now and I recommend this place to friends.  It is not inexpensive but you get lovely service and quality treats.  It is quite filling too.   The setting is lovely and the owners have a lovely collection of tea cups and teapots so that you have a touch of elegance at your table.  They have a menu for those who do not want the high tea service.  It is all lovely.  Looking forward to our next visit.  Tip:  make a reservation!  This is a family run business so please keep it thriving by trying it out.  I want it to last a long time and therefore everyone must know about this hidden treasure!  Spread the word!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended me to try the Guildwood Tea Room. My mom and I went on a Thursday around 2pm, and it was quite busy. 
I did make reservations for \"high tea\" a few days beforehand. The server mentioned you do need a reservation for \"high tea\" and they only accept walk-ins if they wish to order off a menu. 
For high tea, there are a series of courses including, strawberries, scones, finger sandwiches and ends with a selection of desserts. the scones were flaky and made perfectly. High tea is approx. $27/person, but it is totally worth it.

Parking is accessible. 

My only hope is this business can expand more in order to accept more walk-in customers. 

Overall, good experience and I will like to come again to order off the menu."}
