Ukrainian delights, people! If you leave here hungry, the entire Ukrainian population will personally feel that it has failed you. Hunger is not an option. You must leave in a crippling state of fullness and discomfort, having eaten enough cabbage rolls and various deli meats to rival the quantity of food a championship sumo wrestler or Coney Island hot dog eating competitor would eat. 

Once you announce that you're full and have had enough, another course will be brought to you, and so forth until you've eaten so much you have to be hoisted out of the place on a stretcher. That's just the way Ukrainians roll.

So here's the deal with Baby Point: they're caterers, and they do up pretty much every Ukrainian event in the city. If you've ever been to Ukrainian Festival, a Ukie wedding, baby shower, wedding shower, christening, etc., in Toronto I guarantee you've tasted the ambrosia that is Baby Point. In my family there hasn't been a single life milestone that hasn't been celebrated with a meal catered by Baby Point. One of my cousins has so many Ukie friends getting married, having kids, etc. that he eats here on a weekly basis, sometimes twice in one weekend.

The venue itself is often used for these events and you can come by any time to order food to go as they're always slaving away in the kitchen anyway and there are shit tons of leftovers. The venue is nothing to get excited about; it's like a church basement with minimal decor, big buffet tables and an errant step outside the washroom that you will trip over every time despite the caution sign.

But the food.

MY LORD, THE FOOD!

Borscht served in clear \"Polish\" mugs. \"Patychky\" (meat on a stick), Chicken Kyiv, \"Holubtsi\" (cabbage rolls), \"Pyrohy\" (pierogies), meat and cheese cannelloni, \"Nalesnyky\" (a type of sweet or savory crepe, but thicker than a regular one), and more.

But the real stars here are these two unforgettable, bite-sized babies:
* \"Knyshi\" (I don't know how to say this in English): tiny little poppers of rice, gypsy meat that are breaded and deep-fried. I could eat 1000 of these.
* \"Baraboli\": tiny Parisian style roast potatoes in ball format that are seasoned with rosemary and thyme and perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Again, I could eat 1000 of these. 

Gorging is encouraged. 

They also have a badass reputation for making gorgeous fruit salad sculptures shaped like peacocks and boars n' stuff (see pics). And obviously the pastries are nothing short of thrilling."}
