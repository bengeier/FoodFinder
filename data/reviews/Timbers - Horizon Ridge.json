{"text":"It's our favorite bar! We come here for happy hour, brunch and everything in between! Our most favorite waitress ever works here - Ask for Kamie! Always keeps your drinks full & smiles on your face...Tell her J & V sent you....Her favorite lesbian couple. We love the chips & spinach & cheese dip...the breakfast is always amazing!! This is our place that we love so much!"}
{"text":"Pretty chill place to play video poker, pool or watch the game. Great food selection, prices are on an average of $10 a plate. Beer is $15 a pitcher. So it's a little pricey but the environment is nice. Staff was fairly pleasure and service was good."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place often, but the table-top machines are always full of non-gamers, management does not ask for them to move for people who want to play. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Screw this place did an order for pick up through grub hub and they never got it even though they confirmed it through grub hub over 45 min before I arrived and said and that they don't even allow a pick up option and that it has to be delivered. Everyone in there was helpful for the first two min until they realized that my order was missing. Not a pleasant experience. I will never go back."}
{"text":"If I could give zero or negative stars I would. Went in with my friend and the bartenders were so rude. There was hardly anyone in the bar and they were too busy talking with each other to take care of their customers. Once our order was finally taken, it took forever to get it and it was as if there was only juice/ice, nothing else. If you're going to play any games be prepared for the machines to not work once you finally get your money in. Then you will have to wait 20 minutes for them to bring your cash to you. Don't question the staff about anything because they will get a HUGE attitude and raise their voice. I will NEVER go back, HORRIBLE experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this bar and I always have a wonderful time! Tonight was the first time I had the pleasure in meeting the GM, Trevett, and he made us feel right at home! Not only is the food great, but the service is even better! Allen, out regular bartender, took great care of us, as well as our new friend Zelilah! We will definitely be back per usual"}
{"text":"Stopped in on New Year's Day and had the best service ever!!! Jason the bartender gave excellent and Professional Service when he went on a break Joe came out and was also very professional hadn't been there in years definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Great service by Christine! Good came out fast and hot! Drinks are very reasonable and food is very tasty. Great aT to grab dinner and watch some sports on the T.V."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to have a drink and shoot some pool. There are plenty of tv's for sports, comfy chairs or booths, and gaming at the bar.

The food is typical bar food affair.

The staff is courteous and accommodating. Never have they messed up of forgotten an order. Further, when there is a problem (such as a pool table eating your quarters) they're more than generous."}
{"text":"Friend and I ate there last night!  The service was good!  No wait for table as it was rather late but the food was tasty and the presentation was good!  I had the Hawaiian Burger  it was delish just a little messy with the Teriyaki sauce but 10 napkins later lol   And my friend had the Mushroom Swiss with onion rings and he said that was delish also was comparable with prices anywhere else.

Not sure if I would want to go there to eat when there is a sports event going on, probably would be way to loud!"}
{"text":"I came in to gamble and noticed a commotion at the bar.  There was an older gentleman at the bar with a \"service\" dog on a bar stool next to him.  It apparently is a normal occurrence due to all the staff petting and letting the dog lick them.  I began to watch more closely and saw the food servers petting the dog, then go either to a table or into kitchen and return promptly carrying food...which leads me to believe that no one was washing their hands.  A service dog is not supposed to be touched and be on the floor by the owners feet.  Observing all of this, I noticed a young woman confront the dog owner and ask him to put the dog on the floor off of the seat away from her food that she was eating.  The dog owner proceeded to say that his dog was cleaner than the patrons at the bar and that she was a fu*cki*ng c*nt and then went to a different area of the bar.  In summary: the staff was nice but not mindful enough to be sanitary after touching animals and then serving food.  Watching this take place, it was very disheartening. I heard something she said to a friend next to her.  \"that's why I come out to eat in a restaurant...so I don't have to eat next to my cat...which I would never allow at my table in the first place!\" Actually, that was a good point. I would never allow my dog or cat to sit next to me while I eat. I love my pets but they belong on floor away from my food. Isn't that why we feed our animals on the ground?  Just saying. She had a valid point and I wish I had the balls to say something to him or the bartender.  But the staff didn't have the audacity to tell him his dog is not a person and doesn't belong on a chair."}
{"text":"Ok. I stopped coming here for a while. It's now going to be permanent. Last time I was in here the bartender spent more time taking to a couple of females sitting at the bar rather than checking on me or my group. I guess it's more important for her to have conversation than make money. I suppose it's not a good idea to check on those who feed a lot if money into their machines. I will no longer come into this location, however there is a Timbers on Gibson Road that I will go to instead."}
{"text":"Best bar in Henderson! The whole staff is amazing, friendly and a whole lots of fun to hang out with. Karen, Joe, Allen, Delilah, Kory and Kendy are all Awesome!! Allen and Joe are twins and will crack you up! The best Blueberry Hef beer and food is delicious. It's just a fun place to chill after work and relax and they treat you like family. They introduce themselves right when you sit at the bar. We come here after work everyday just to unwind and relax. I highly recommend you to try out this place!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great!

The atmosphere is comfortable and fun. The staff is friendly and responsive (especially Allen). The menu has great variety and I haven't tried anything that wasn't delicious. On top of all that, the prices are low, making it a perfect place to hang out and watch football on the weekend."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Service is depends on who your waiter/waitress and food is pretty good for a bar. Its a chill bar that people often overlook. I got the Farm burger which was really good and perfectly cooked. I asked for medium rare and that is what I got.  If you can cook meat good, you got my vote!
Happy hour is cool, make some damn good margaritas."}
{"text":"Timbers is A+ pretty much all around. The service, food, drinks, gaming and cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent.  My family has lived here three years and we have gotten to know some of the good people who make this bar & grill one of my favorite places to eat, gamble and hangout.  Tammy, Kendy, Joe, Allen, Barbie, Karen, Cory & Nichol are a great team who make everyone feel welcome and appreciated as a customer and friend.  I have been going to restaurants and bars for over 50 years and this team of people including the kitchen people are one of the best I've ever seen.  To me it's a five star.  Try it for yourselves, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  Same thing every time.  I have to ask bartenders for attention when I want a drink.  They walk right by.  The machines have ashes all over them.  The machines seem really tight.  Then while I am playing $1.25 a spin they tell me I can only get one drink per $20 dollars I put in the Machine, that's infuriating.  It's really smoke filled.  Oh well, down the block I go."}
{"text":"My roommate and I got coupons in the mail for a free pitcher of beer and thats the reason we decided to go here in the first place.  This place is awesome!  The service was amazing, the food was great and the overall atmosphere was enjoyable!!!!!!  We liked it so much we decided to go back the next day without free beer coupons!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a few times after work with a co-worker who frequents here often. Cory (bartender) has waited on us before & a friendly, blonde bartender who's name neither one of us know? They both keep the drinks coming while we are putting money into the video poker machines. My friend has hit big twice & I've won a little one time but I can't say that the machines really pay out a lot to me....lol The last time I was in there was a regular who must of went to the ATM 4 times to keep taking money out. The last time he couldn't get any but he kept putting his money into the video poker machine & not winning. He should of quit a long time ago. 

I always end up getting hungry when I'm here & get the same thing because it's so yummy!!!! BBQ chicken pizza! If this is a kind you like then you must try it!!!!! It definitely tastes better hot out of the oven then left over. The onion rings are pretty good for not being hand made. They are frozen but still yummy! I also tried one of my friend's chicken tacos which wasn't bad either. So far the food is pretty good! 

It seems like there's a lot of locals that go here. The dinning room areas can get a little busy @ times. They also have pool tables (2 I believe). I'm going to host one of my Meetups here for a Happy Hour soon."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere , Cory bartender is super fun watching hockey play offs !! Super service and friendliest  staff in whole area ."}
{"text":"Timbers is a bar and grill that offers a bar atmosphere to watch sporting events on TV, while also giving customers a dining area if they aren't there to watch a game. My friend and I had a late dinner the other night about 11pm. I ordered the philly cheesesteak with fries and my friend got the sliders. Both were yummy!

They are open 24 hours so it's a good place to go when nothing else is open. They have typical bar food."}
{"text":"Ordered fiesta salad to go. Drove from Stephanie to home at end of Horizon Ridge Pkwy. Opened box to find rusty lettuce and not the usual amount of tortilla strips and garnishments. Afraid to eat it, I drove all the way back. They were apologetic. Offered to replace but my appetite is ruined. I won't be back. Wish I could include the video I took. It was gross. Like they made it in the same lighting as the bar.  Yeckkkkkkk!!!!!

I see the General Manager wants me to call him back. I don't ever feel like eating your food ever again. Thanks for trying though."}
{"text":"I hate to admit this, but I went here for Thanksgiving for 2 years in a row, at least.

With family out of town and not wanting to cook or have leftovers for weeks, we chose Timbers for Thanksgiving. They were nice, the decor is better than McDonalds.

This last time we went there for Thanksgiving I was disappointed, though. They put a bunch of tables together and had an employee feast. Right there in the middle of the customers. So here's this huge turkey and a bunch of other food on this huge, long table and the WAITERS are eating the whole time you're supposed to get served. I understand they're humans too and they're working on Thanksgiving, but the service was poor and I felt like a dog in a cage getting teased by their owner with a bone.

I love their food. It's all affordable and excellent. They're very clean. The red-skin mashed potatoes are awesome! Pretty much everything I've ordered here has been great.

Everyone else got it right with 4 stars.
And yes, the halibut fish sandwich is great."}
{"text":"The bartender Allen suggested the beef steak, which went perfect with the appletini ."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the Packers/ Giants game as I wasn't going to make it to my side of town before start time. The place was packed with one bartender, I was thinking it was going to be a dry game. Needless to say, Kory the bartender stepped up and nailed it. He was quick, professional and on top of the needs of all the patrons, especially the Giant fans that were crying in their beers. Great place, I'm going to stop in next time in Henderson."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends from school  for drinks on a Wednesday night. 

Bar/lounge review only:

The Good:
- cheap, tasty mixed drinks
- $4 for a glass of Blue Moon :) 
- laid-back vibe
- swanky and comfortable seats situated in the corner for those who are inebriated and therefore cannot stand (I am guilty).
- two pool tables
-plenty of seating
-the place was EMPTY, as it was a Wednesday night. 
-video blackjack/poker at the bar
-friendly and attentive bartenders

The So-So:
- It was empty, as it was a Wednesday night. Wait.. I said that already. 

The Bad:
- Nothing!  You can't really f*ck up a night (especially with good company) at the bar.

Overall, this was a great hang-out spot for drinks and for chillaxing.  I had fun and would come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a few beers and watch some football.  While sitting at a machine (not playing) the bartender asked if I would move for some players.  No sweat...I get it.  In return I received a free beer.  A very polite gesture and I would have no problems drinking here again."}
{"text":"We thought we found our new favorite spot to eat. We've been going in and looking forward to eating there. Today we went in and they changed the menu. No more of our favorite hash browns. And they raised the prices The girls are always really friendly and working hard but I think they were short staffed today. It wasn't their fault but service was slow. Get it together Timbers Management. Love your customers and your Staff by keeping your prices low and food tasty."}
{"text":"Since my review over a year ago, we have given this place a few more visits to give it a fair shot.  

Service had really improved since the first time.  The waitresses have been really friendly and attentive comparatively. 

I've come to realize that there are better items on the menu.  I was really impressed with the fish tacos made with grilled tilapia.  Great flavor with the Baja sauce and pico de gallo.  The sliders are ok.  The buns are still a little dry but the French fries are good! 

They often mail out coupons which make for a great deal for two people to enjoy a meal.   I was glad to see some improvements here!"}
{"text":"Service, price and food are excellent. But the to-go utensil quality needs some improvement...."}
{"text":"It's just ok here. I gave it 3 stars because they're open 24 hours and the drinks come fast. This was my first time at this location. I've been to other timbers in the past and never been impressed.

I tried the Southwest Burger. I asked for medium rare and it came out medium well. It was loaded with lettuce. It comes with chipotle mayo and that's the only ingredient with any flavor.

If I go back I'll try the wings."}
{"text":"This place is ok for a local spot to grab a quick drink but nothing else. Came with my hubby to pregame the night and grab a bite to eat. The bartender was very nice and attentive. The patrons are average no diversity. I ordered the beef nachos. First off my nachos were burnt and they overwhelm you with jalapeños and that was the main reason behind my 3 star review. Only good a place for you if you wanna get a drink and gambling a little bit nothing more"}
{"text":"A real big change. Was a great family stop. Arranged so that bar & pool table guests could enjoy Timbers food & drink too.
Redesign. Forget it now. Not comfy. Food is yum. Just not my place anymore. Sad. Been. Timbers girl since the doors opened"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit here, Korey definitely made us wanting to come back!! So entertaining and great service. Thank you Korey!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I work from home and anytime I want to get out of the house, I come here. The servers are always great and the food is the best bar food anywhere. It's pretty quiet during the day which is how I like it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Henderson. I've been going here for 4 years now and never been disappointed. I usually see Karen, Allen, or Joe and they are all amazing. Friendly, funny, and great sense of humor. The fingers and fries and turkey burger are amazing. I have never been disappointed with this place. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a relaxed night out for a few drinks"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with good service and food. Bartenders are on it and food comes out hot and fast. We typically go out late at night for better-than-pub food and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great for locals casual dining. Not pricey at all."}
{"text":"Used to be a great family spot. Now they have decided to cater to people who smoke.  The place reeks of stale cigarette smoke, and not a great environment to try to eat food in.  Sunday night and pretty much empty. Obviously I'm not the only one that thinks it's gone downhill."}
{"text":"Best Bar Food! Best Bartenders! Joe & Allen always make our visits fun! It has become our Friday nights out and our Saturday morning breakfast"}
{"text":"I was in on Monday night. My waitress was Nicole. She was so friendly and extremely knowledgable of the menu (I had a lot of questions). I will definitely be back to this establishment because of her. And the food was great too! I highly recommend this bar!"}
{"text":"I like the laid back atmosphere of this location. The food is good bar food, that comes out fast and the service is quick. My favorite reason to stop here is to see Kory the hilarious red-headed barman. He cracks me up and makes the best shots in the world."}
{"text":"We love going here but today 3/18/18 at 4:55 was terrible. Sat there for 10 minutes while wait staff went all around us served so broke who came in after us so we walked out. Don't go on on Sunday"}
{"text":"This place is like a cave. No windows, dim lighting, reeks of stale smoke. How anyone could sit and enjoy a meal is beyond me. No one to great you when you walk in. I don't even know what to say except just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This timbers is my go to bar, it's close, always clean, and the servers and bartenders are so friendly. Especially Barbie, she really is the best. So kind and friendly and on top of her stuff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer at the end of a very hot day. They have a decent selection of beers and the menu looks good, but I didn't try any of the food. Allen, he bartender, was super nice. Overall it looks like a nice neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Food was good bar food. Had the wings and the nachos. Service was horrible. The bartender had to pickup the slack for our worthless waitress."}
{"text":"We have been going here for many years. After our workout class yesterday 3 of us met here for breakfast . The bartender came to take our order and delivered our coffee. We waited 45 minutes for our food before walking out. (We all did pay for our coffee).  It's hit and miss here at this place. It could be an awesome place to go if only the service was more consistent."}
{"text":"I visited a friend in Henderson for two weeks. I that two weeks, we came here 3 times because of the awesome Happy Hour! I normally am a beer snob but a pitcher of Bud Light that pours 4 pints for $8 was hard to pass up. Every time I ate there, the food was delicious. My favorite was the pastrami sliders. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty chill. A bunch of us went on a weekday night to just hang out and relax. We played pool and had some drinks (none of us ate, though i want to return and try their food). Our server was very nice and speedy, the bartender I first interacted with upon arriving there was a little rude, but, nothing that obnoxious. Drinks were well priced and were decent in strength. Great selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from this particular location of the local chain.  I was newly single, in a new place, and really, the last thing I wanted to do some night was stay at home.  Well, my house wasn't exactly anything close to being central, and there weren't a lot of other options if I didn't want to make the trek 'into the city,' so I ended up  here a lot.

It's just a little restaurant and pub comparable to PT's and the like, but I always liked it a little better.  First of all, as a restaurant they serve up traditional American food and do it well.  It's not legendary fare, but their breakfasts are great and they do bar food (wings, nachos, fries, etc.) as well as can be asked.  Their barkeeps are quick and friendly and drinks are reasonably priced.  They've got a few different game options and a pool table, and the place is always comfortable and clean.

It's nothing to make a trek out for, but if you're in the area it's one of your better choices for food/drinks."}
{"text":"Pop into Timbers occasionally for a cocktail or a meal. Food is really good. Beware of the machines though, they are tight! Not much play, you are better off buying your drinks,"}
{"text":"drinks are cheap and depending on what shift you go on service can vary.  just a little local spot to get some gambling in."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! I have been going to timbers for almost 10 years, and this location for almost a year. The staff rocks and the food is great. If you're looking for affordable drinks and good burgers then this is the place for you! Best of luck if you decide to gamble :)"}
{"text":"So I haven't been on in awhile sorry.. 
yesterday we ventured into Timbers on Horizon and Stephanie ..  Great service by Sarah and James the Manager was great..I will return because they always do you right! Thank you Sarah my new favorite Food Server.. Ask for her!"}
{"text":"$50 in play and I had to pay full price for my 2 beers. Super lame. It sucks, because I actually like this place. You can't swing a dead cat in this town without hitting a local bar willing to comp for play.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and 12 wings, fries and a soda.  Wings were meaty and cooked great. Tammy was my waitress and was super friendly and gave me her favorites on the menu. Very attentive service and food out quick despite being busy for the lunch rush. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"i love love love this place!!! Its very spacious and has a rustic decor that reminds me of my home town! We have been here several times, my review will be for my latest visit for the Seahawks monday night game! 
as always you seat yourself and our regular area was wide open so we got our pick of seats. We showed up before kickoff so we also got $5 off coupons for our bill which was very nice!

our meals: i always have a margarita they are the best ive ever had! and during football they are only $3 (actually i had two) light and refreshing not a lot of mixer just enough!

we were going to have regular chip nachos but  my fiance wanted to try the potato nachos called irish nachos. we opted to have the wildfire chili to top them they were delish!

at half time we decided to share a burger and being my fiance was so overwhelmed with the seahawks awesomeness he didnt even look at the menu and said cheese burger! i was alittle upset i like to try different thinks but i was feeling good (due to margaritas?)   so i didnt complain. 
when it arrived it was thick and juciy and very flavorful you get to pick you bun and cheese for a basic burger i would order again and again! 

we will be regulars at timbers its our place!!!"}
{"text":"First time for lunch this past Friday. Ordered fish & chips. VERY good. Great service. Pleasant and friendly and fast. Sensitive to the fact that my lunch time was brief and I had to get back to work. Will return!"}
{"text":"The place was cute and homey.    We had a party of 5 and ordered lunch.    The server who took our order said she was not our server , our server was on break and she was just taking our order.     Most everyone got a burger and she asked coleslaw , French fries or onion rings.    Two took the onion rings and all took coleslaw.    One person ordered steak and eggs and asked if they could give him hash browns instead of the toast.    She said no.  He would have to pay for extra hash browns.      When the bill came we were charged extra for onion rings and coleslaw.     Real server explained we had ordered double sides.   Anyway thought the server was arguing with everything, wouldn't take any discount for sides we were never told were extra.     Bad customer service.      Food was decent but the surprise bill at the end ruined it"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while visiting the area. Friendly service.  Nice bar area.  Shared some angus sliders and buffalo fries. Both were good. Always enjoy a little video poker too."}
{"text":"Be careful with this place they send out a lot of coupons in the mail but when you try to use them the morning waitresses try to rip you off. Be sure to check your bill. The waitress also rounded up the change to her benefit this does not sit well with me because she rounded it up to$0.60 to her benefit. I like to be in charge of how much I tip. The food is good though. Also be careful because they charge for extra things like onions but they don't tell you until you get your bill. The waitress and bartender staff really need to be coached as to better customer service. Then they wouldn't have to steal from customers and would make good tips on their own."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips with French fries and a beer. Wife had the turkey burger. All the food was good and generous portions, $35 including tip for three dinners not bad. We get $10 off coupons. Always pleased with food and service at Timbers."}
{"text":"After a tough workout at the gym, I was craving for crispy chicken tenders *shrugs*.  Since Timbers was right around the corner, we decided to try out their bar food.  

So on the menu, it reads \"Voted Best Bar Food in Las Vegas,\" I was hopeful.  We ordered crispy chicken tenders and fries, and also a bowl of chili which comes w/flat bread.  We wanted clam chowder, but it was only on Fridays, and they ran out of soup.

When the food came out, the plate of chicken tenders was huge.  5 big pieces of tender, 2 carrot sticks, 2 celery sticks, and a pile of medium size, whitish fries.  There were 2 pcs of flat bread that accompanied the bowl of chili.  

Chicken tenders and fries:  NO BUENO.  They were heavily battered and kinda salty.  I can still taste the salt on my tongue as I am writing this review (bleh, MUST....DRINK...H2O).  The fries were undercooked.  I could taste the grittiness of the potatoes.  

Bowl of Chili:  Blah Blah Blah.  The flatbread was cold and hard.  Not worth a penny.

I will not come here for bar food...actually, I will not come back for anything! Eek!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football!! Happy hour deals are great and the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a sporting event. Good food, love a good burger and beer .  The service is great and location is good, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for YEARS!!!  The food is yummy bar food, a little salty but they have a great selection of beer on tap so it is okay.  The best part is the staff.  Even if it has been 6 months since I have been Karen there remembers my name, my drink and enough to ask me about my job search or new job.  She pays attention and treats me like an old friend.  I brought my mom and she treated her like a longtime customer.  There are bars everywhere, the people there are what makes me remember to go back.  The twins are awesome too! The last star is gone because of the salt in the food and the fact that they have pepsi.  What bar can't offer rum n' coke?  Rum and Pepsi doesn't exist."}
{"text":"Stick with hamburgers. The steak sandwich was full of gristle and they really didn't care. The fish was okay but the breeding was very thick. 
It's okay for burgers."}
{"text":"It's ok left once was hard to get anybody's attention. Average food, had breakfast once it was ok. Ok set up basic bar. Food was a little pricey."}
{"text":"This very well may be the best bar/pub/restaurant in Vegas/Henderson.  I am comparing Timbers with PT's (not so great) and the Village Pub (my favorite until I found Timbers).

My wife and I get breakfast here as well as take out in the evening.

The food is well above your bar/pub food and the Chicken Philly is sensational, the best I've had in the city.  The fries are crisp with just the right amount of salt and a few other spices.  Breakfast is great with the big bear and the little bear, more than enough with pancakes on the side. 

***The Spinach Dip*** incredible!!! Hard to find a good spinach dip anywhere in Henderson or Vegas for that matter. 

Unfortunately we don't eat red meat, so I can only imagine how good the regular philly would be along with the burgers.  However, I may cave one day and try a burger.  Ohhhh how I miss beef.

Tacos: chicken and fish are awesome!
Salads: super good, super fresh!

Everyone is friendly.  The staff and waitresses are some of the best in the valley.  Fast, courteous, and helpful.  I'm blanking on our waitresses name, but she is awesome, as we eat here about 3 times a week.

Look for the coupons in your mail, they are fantastic.

I'm yet to try the keno/poker machines and have drinks; one day soon.

It's above average; takeout is fast; the food quality and amount of food you get is impressive.

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent local bar to grab a quick drink and some grub. I like to play on the machines, usually video black jack or poker and the bartenders usually keep the drinks coming! I have an average ROI with these machines, so far so good.

I usually split a pizza with a friend or coworker whenever I'm here. Classic pepperoni tastes good and so does their bbq chicken pizza. I think their fries and onion rings are frozen, but still taste decent. Other options for food seem to have huge portions.

They have two pool tables, but those are usually occupied. It seems like this is a popular local spot, and it makes sense because the service is good and the food quality is decent. 

There are a lot of TV screens to watch different sporting events. Parking is ample, it's pretty easy to park in this parking lot."}
{"text":"Food is Great and Services is just as Good!! The prices are fair and reasonable, better than other bar/grill places in the area. The location near the freeway makes it very helpful and convenient."}
{"text":"This is a fun local's place. I was in town visiting my brother and he took me here for lunch. The food was great and huge portions. Even won enough money playing a poker machine at the bar that I left Vegas after 4 days without losing a penny of my own money.. The staff is wildly entertaining and friendly."}
{"text":"Corey and Christine were great!  The food service was timely and my food was delivered hot."}
{"text":"I'm just going to give this place 5 stars to negate all the dog haters who have left 1 star. Just because staff is friendly to a service dog doesn't mean you should go knocking down the establishment. If you want to control every aspect of your meal and how it's prepared and brought to you, why don't you stay home?"}
{"text":"This is my local pub and I go in to watch football every Sunday. It is exactly what you would expect when entering a bar/pub. There are TV's everywhere, a decent selection of bar food, pool tables, a few arcade games and plenty of seating for video poker. 

The main reason why I have ranked them with 4 stars is due to the staff. The bartenders and servers are all super nice and attentive. Most of them have worked there for a long time so they know a lot of the patrons. Overall this is a just a nice neighborhood hang out and I would recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This place pretty much sucks. I used to go there pretty often because it's close to where I live; but it's just not good. The food is gross. The only thing I ever had there that was good was a French dip sandwich. Everything else has been pretty awful. The breakfast food is alright I guess. They should have more beers on tap. And better food. Maybe just start all over, I dunno..."}
{"text":"I had heard from numerous people that the fish and fries were awesome here and they were right!! Amazing food!! I will definitely be back!! The service was okay, but they were also very busy."}
{"text":"I loved getting breakfast here previously. It was one of the few major bars in the valley that served hash browns instead of diced potatoes,  not only was it disappointing to not have the hash browns anymore but the potatoes just aren't good."}
{"text":"First off, the bar serves great drinks. Downside is my friend, myself and my husband wanted to go from some drinks, eat and play a little. The bar itself was completely full with no place to gamble. So we were sat at a booth which is fine. I could do without losing a few hundred dollars. We ordered our food, our waitress was nice. Coming around every few minutes to make sure all was okay. I ordered the turkey sliders. Which were great and my friend and my husband seemed to be enjoying their meal as well. As I was on my second to last slider (there were four) I took a bite and as I pulled the sandwich away from my mouth there was something still connecting me to the sandwich. My worse nightmare happened...I found a long black hair coming from my slider. My husband and friend instantly stopped eating. I alerted the waitress who was pretty shocked and let the manager know. Which later upset me. They offered just to take my food off the bill which to me almost consuming something that came from another human being which is DISGUSTING that offer was simply not ok. I wasn't expecting anything crazy I mean it was probably a mistake that a simple HAIR NET could've fixed but the manager never came by to apologize the accident. Instead he had the waitress take the blame. Which was unprofessional in my opinion. I expected of course not to pay for the meal but at least comp a portion of the drinks or something. Definitely was not happy to say the least. We still however left the waitress a good tip because like I said it wasn't her fault. I just expected the situation to have been felt with differently.





*******UPDATE********

The GM of the this location James has contacted me. Super nice guy and has thoroughly made me a happy customer. For that I will change my rating from 1 star to at least 3, because that was all I wished for the night it happened. So thank you Timbers & James and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the spin dip ! Tacos are great , sliders and breakfast 24/7! Not nearly as smokey as alot of places ! Love the gambler's bonus , no card needed . So open and nice atmosphere. Go see kory ! But all the bartenders are awesome , they wont disappoint."}
{"text":"So its been a minute since I came here.   I had some time to kill before meeting some people so I thought why not have a quick drink.   I walked in and it was not very busy.  Waited for a drink, and waited and waited.  I guess they thought I just came into to sit at this bar and walk people gamble.  So I finally put a 20 into a machine.  Then hit cash out.  It was the only way to get someone to do anything.  With all the other places to drink and hang out in this town I can check this joint off the \"Yea I don't go there\" list.  FAIL."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered take out and not good at all the western philly was dry and the fries were hard and cold no seasoning and the chilli to salty they won't be getting my business anymore!! Bad cooking skills. Don't see were the best bar food 8 years in a row came from!!"}
{"text":"Excellent club sandwich! My dad and sister meet here somewhat often for brunch on Sundays so, of course, I join them if I'm in town. (Yes, it's a little weird being at a pub at 10:30am on a Sunday, but hey-- it's Vegas, baby!) The service is usually good. I tried my dad's patty melt and it was really good. My mom was happy with her clubhouse omelette. My only complaint is that the bathroom is defunct. The sinks are barely a dribble when turned to full-power so it takes 10 minutes to wash your hands thoroughly. A decent bar-food venue.

Update 12/27/07: WooHOO! They fixed the sinks, they fixed the sinks! Now if only they would chill with the morning rap music blaring in the restroom..."}
{"text":"Great place for football. Good drink specials. Baby bear breakfast is amazing for a great price. The server on Sundays, Barbie, is awesome"}
{"text":"Karen is a lively and awesome bartender! Love how she interacts with the patrons and greets people when they walk in. I really do appreciate that she remembered what I wanted the first time I came in. I encourage anybody in Henderson to drop by and come see her, awesome service thank you."}
{"text":"Every week I make a trip down here with my best girlfriend and we always have a wonderful time! Tonight was exceptionally fun when we walked into their holiday Christmas party where we were greeted by tons of goodies and warm smiles! The general manager, Trevett, was awesome and made us feel right at home! Our regular bartenders never seem to fail us! We love you Zelilah & Allen!!!"}
{"text":"The food is BAD, even for bar food.  I'd rather go to any number of other Bars in the area to eat.  The service is Also BAD, another problem.  Dining area was almost empty and we had to constantly look for our waitress.  I wouldn't recommend it, too many other better options."}
{"text":"Eh, if you're looking for a cheap, greasy breakfast after a long night of drinking, this is the place for you.. Unfortunately for me I was stone cold sober or this place may have gotten 4 or 5 stars out of me! 

We tried this place mainly b/c it's right around the corner from us & after getting a late start, we didn't want to drive too far. Hubby & I both ordered just the basic breakfast.. 2 eggs, bacon & hasbrowns. The food was sitting in so much grease, especially under the hasbrowns which I barely touched b/c along with being too greasy, they tasted like they were made a day or two before & then reheated on the flat top. The bacon was more like beef jerky than bacon, really tough & also had a reheated taste to it as well. It certainly wasn't fresh bacon. My stomach started protesting about my meal as we were leaving. 

Service was fine but I'm not eating out just for good service, I prefer good food as well. Also, even though the sign at the front said it was a \"non-smoking establishment\" or something along those lines, the place reeked like ciggie smoke. Bleh!"}
{"text":"Live next door to the place and its a privilege. The food is really good, awesome service, a pool table is always open and everyones very friendly always."}
{"text":"breakfast for lunch.... had the french toast. Great service, and very tasty food!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

A strong option for when looking for a local place to drink and grab a bite!  I came here with coworkers in desperate need of some drinks and this place delivered.  The food is basic, but good.  Also, the cushy, comfortable chairs were awesome to sink into after a long day on my feet.  The decor is so much nicer here than the one on Gibson.  If I had to choose one it would be this one every time.  

But, of course, the smoke is such a killer.  My eyes were killing the whole next day.  And the service was almost TOO attentive.  I felt like they were coming over every 5 minutes to ask if we wanted anything else to drink.  

I'd come back here if it's where others wanted to go but probably won't choose it over other options because of the smoke."}
{"text":"Went to Timbers late night for some quick food, and was pleasantly surprised to get great service. Stacy was our bartender. We got fast, friendly service. The Bloody Mary's we ordered were great. Thank you Stacy!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I had given this location 5 stars in 2015.  But F that.  Sorry, but this place on food service has hit an all time low.  I have called on two separate occasions to place an order for pick up AND they put me on hold and NEVER pick the phone back up!!! I waited 30 minutes the first time and 15 minutes tonight.  It pisses me off!  Last time, I didn't return for months.  A couple of weeks ago we had the worst service and the place wasn't busy.  They took forever to take our order and never refilled our drinks!  I am a decent tipper and don't ask for anything special.  WTH!  (Entry angry face here).  I wish people would value customer service."}
{"text":"If you want a good steak sandwich you can't go wrong. That's all I can tell you about the food,but I promise the steak sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is good, but they need to update the menu. The wings are great! They are big, not tiny sparrow wings like most places serve. They also have killer cheesy artichoke dip! YUM.  I love Connie the grave bartender, she is always nice, and kind. Very attentive. Machines are tight, but go for the food."}
{"text":"Very good food had sliders done to perfection waitress was best had ever in long time in Vegas. Sydney S. Could not have been more polite and attentive to our needs"}
{"text":"Dropped in here around 545pm on a Wednesday night. Most of the bar was full, as it was happy hour. My friend and I did find a couple open machines so we sat down. This is a typical Timbers, lots of tables outside of the bar area. I didn't notice any pool tables like others, but that doesn't mean they don't have one. I mostly came to watch the basketball game while my friend gambled.

Service at this Timbers was very good. Unlike the one up in NW on Cheyenne/215...they were prompt with taking orders and delivering drinks, as well as the food. Even a manager came around to check up on us. 

My friend won $500 so I expect we will be coming back. I lost my $20."}
{"text":"I had an awesome server, her name was Jenifer and was super sweet and super fast!! I love that they have breakfast 24 hrs!!"}
{"text":"I love eating at this place. Great food . Unfortunately OUR WAITRESS AMBER WAS BLIND AND COULDN'T READ THE EXERTION OF OUR COUPON. So needless to say she got a small tip. Next time bust out a magnifier so you can read it right."}
{"text":"What a letdown. I remember the timbers I used to go to having some of the best bar food in town. Then it seemed they all started to close down. Just moved to this area of town and was excited to see there was a timbers. Visited twice to eat and have a few drinks and was pretty disappointed both times as quality seems to have gone down. On both visits my burger was ok I guess but ordered it medium and came out well done and it lacked flavor. I remember the burgers being excellent in the past. Fries were old and cold on both of our orders and my fiancée chicken wings were overcooked. Maybe it was the cook that day as another table had a breakfast order that looked terrible which they didn't even touch. I had a beer which was good but hard to screw that up. She ordered a Mai tai from the speciality drink menu and it was the worst drink I think I've ever tasted. It looked way too dark. Isn't a Mai tai supposed to be bright in color with the fruit juice? It was straight dark rum and a splash of pineapple. To top it off waitress was pretty rude and offended when we sent the drink back so I was not going to send the food back to have God knows what done to it. Won't be back. Shame cause as I said I used to love timbers."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is always great. It's a great local place to just chill and have a drink or to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner. The only negative thing is that they don't have dessert:("}
