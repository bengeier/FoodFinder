{"text":"This place is great! I'm mad because I've driven by numerous time and wish had stopped sooner. I had the winner chicken dinner and gumbo. Perfect! Anyone who doesn't like the food is a putz and probably doesn't like much of anything. I will go back again and again. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great place. Had the hot chicken and Cajun fried rice. Delicious. The sweet tea tasted like I used to drink in Memphis. The place is carryout so you probably want to call ahead."}
{"text":"The chicken deserves 5 stars but the other food... no! The mac and cheese is terrible. Kraft tastes better than what I got from here (I've eaten here 4 times now). The biscuits were terrible! It tastes like flour, too much salt and water baked into a circle that's called a biscuit. Not even bitter fixed the flavor. I'm a service member, so I've had some nasty food before but this tops even the worst biscuits I've ever had. I wish they would try baked mac and cheese and maybe try a new biscuit recipe. The chicken is so good. The service is always good too. 

In addition, the smoked peach tea tastes like bon fire ash with peaches, and the coleslaw is not good either. I'll keep trying new things there, hopefully it gets better."}
{"text":"Finally visited last night and let me tell you!!!  We are just so excited that Chow Chow is here!  

The food is seasoned to perfection and everything we had was amazing.  From the cool and attentive staff to the quality of food... This place is a new fave.  Always nervous when I get fried food because to many people fried means oily or greasy,not here.  Seriously some of the best fried catfish I've ever had.  Not to mention when we were there they were playing awesome punk music which made our dining experience even better!  Dead Kennedy's and soul food?  Yes, please.  The server said it was the \"chef's choice\"... Another awesome win for the chef!

The Fried Pierogis are a must!!!  Can't wait to try more goodies off the menu... Already thinking about our next visit."}
{"text":"Fast service and very good food. Im had my share of soul food over the years and I was pretty impressed with the winner dinner. Very tasty, but not overly fattening or greasy. I'll definitely be visiting here often."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS and affordable!! Just what my husband and I were looking for when we decided to order takeout on a rainy Saturday! We got winner dinner, bbq smoked pork poboy, and the chicken fried sausage... I would definitely recommend this place! Everything was very good and would absolutely eat here again! 

We got a busy signal the first few times we dialed but keep trying I promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Not really a sit down restaurant. More of order to go. There's a couple chairs and tables but they're not particularly comfortable. The food is good and I've gone a few times."}
{"text":"Wha wha whaaaat? Southern food in Lakewood? After a long distance love affair with Tennessee hot chicken, I spied this little gem on my way into work a few streets down. \"Hot chicken?\" I wondered. One look at the simple menu and the divine goddess of Paula Deen came down from Clogged Artery Heaven and blessed me. Us. Blessed all of us.
Ten minutes later I'm rolling my blubbery ass down the street to pick up my chicken, sides and charred peach sweet tea. Food coma for less than $15.
Honey child lemme tell you, I've had chicken. I've had some chicken, m'hmmmm. This is the best fried chicken in Cleveland, and I've been around.
Since that fateful day I've been back, say, around a dozen times and I've had just about everything, I send out of towers who visit my place of work to Chow Chow. I pride myself on giving good food recommendations to folks and Chow Chow is just about my favorite one to give."}
{"text":"Really friendly, welcoming service, amazing food and portion size, good prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Winner Dinner, the fried chicken is the obvious star of the dish, very nicely fried without being soaked in grease.

The sides fall short of the chicken though. I just think they could do a better job on the biscuit/mac & cheese. The biscuit was very average and dry. The mac and cheese was salty and bordering on watery. I ate both but wouldn't brag about them.

Bottom line, the chicken was good enough to go back for. I'm just hoping the sides can be improved over time."}
{"text":"Hot fried chicken and smoked peach tea are killer. Counter guy is super friendly and helpful. Will be back"}
{"text":"If you've never had soul food before, you might like this place. However, if you've ever had true soul food, do not waste your money here. My boyfriend ordered the Winner Dinner, got a measly piece of fried chicken that was more fat than meat with a sorry excuse for breading, lackluster mashed potatoes and a biscuit. I got the mac and cheese that was not even a distant relative to actual mac and cheese, as well as jojo potatoes that were an embarrassment to real jojos everywhere. One dish doesn't have enough seasoning, the other has so much cayenne your tongue incinerates. We waited forty minutes for this food to be cooked ... I'd have been better off taking a $20 and burning it."}
{"text":"I tried Chow Chow Kitchen for the first time today and was very happy with the experience.  Everything on the menu looked great, so it was a hard choice. I finally decided on half a smoked pork po'boy with a bowl of gumbo soup.  The pork was tender and well seasoned, and although it was half a sandwich, it was a very generous portion.  The gumbo soup was delicious - nicely spiced and full of andouille sausage, okra, and rice. It was also a very generous portion.  And all that for $7.50 - quite a good deal!  My only slight disappointment was the caramel apple & cake hash that I had for dessert - $4. I expected more of a baked apple, but it was a raw apple coated in caramelized brown sugar and a crumb topping. Although it was very tasty, it was also hard to eat.  The thin stick that served as the handle broke immediately.  It could become a really great dessert if it was a soft, baked apple with that same coating.  One final thing to add - I think the word is getting out about the place already so they were quite slammed with walk-ins while I was there.  I wish I had ordered ahead because I had to wait 40 minutes for my order."}
{"text":"It's great when a restaurant fully develops their concept. Chow Chow not only has great food, but also has great signage and a cohesive interior."}
{"text":":(    I am one disappointed cajun...but I guess it's fine for those who don't live on this food as a regular meal. The gumbo made me so sad...oh well. Off to another one."}
{"text":"Awesome food, cheap. The Bangers & Beans Po' Boy, Hot Fries, and Pulled Ham & Bean Soup are fantastic."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped here for lunch! It's mostly a takeout place (only 4 tables for dining in) and has a rustic vibe. The food is delicious! I ordered the Fried \"Cowpoke\" Pierogies and Winner Dinner-- both came out hot and battered in a flavorful, crispy batter. I love this take on pierogies! Potato, beans, and pork in a fried shell? Yes please! I even ordered some to go for my family! The fried chicken was also great--the chicken was juicy and again, that batter! Yum yum! And the waffles were great too-- not dry like other places. If you want some good fried chicken-- stop by Chow Chows!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery a few months back and was very disappointed with the food.  I was super excited to try their menu and was let down by the quality.  I ordered the Andouille sausage corn dogs, which were pretty good.  However, the fried chicken was not.  If you are going to have a southern food focus, the fried chicken has got to be killer.  It was too fatty and the breading was bland and not fried crisp.  The mash potatoes and gravy were not bad, I would say average.  Last was the mac and cheese, definitely not cheesy or creamy enough and lacking in flavor.  I know they were relatively new when we ordered and I see a lot of great reviews now.  So, I am planning on giving them another try and I will update if there has been some improvement."}
{"text":"Good, but I wish I had been carrying hot sauce in my bag. Against my better judgement, I went with my friend's suggestion of the winner dinner since she had been there many times. It was just a little bland for me. I'll be back again to order something a little more flavorful, like the spicy chicken with waffles or a po boy."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good buttermilk fried chicken. Moist, with a thick nicely seasoned crust. The mashed potatoes were OK, but the gravy kind of bland. The cole slaw was also bland. But the biscuit -- wow, it was amazing! So buttery! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Soul food on Madison! Two things before we get started: 1) Yup, the main character looks like Orlando Bloom. Husbands, keep your wives in the car when you pick up your grub -- or you'll be trading some mac and cheese for the love of your life! 2) not enough mashed potatoes (they call them \"mashed taters\", which is troublesome on so many levels). 

This is not a restaurant. It is a take-out kitchen like those soul food joints on the east side. It is, if you'll excuse some racial insensitivity, black soul food for the white hipster. There ain't no down-home sweat in these recipes, though, no sir; only tattoo grease and hair gel, cigarette ash and beanie fuzz. Joshin' about the ash and fuzz, but you get the point; this was no place for an old timer like me (ha, I'm only 53). 

We called ahead because another Yelp reviewer (shout out!) took a blurry image of the menu. We saw \"Winner Dinner\" -- fried chicken, mashed \"taters\", and a biscuit -- and gave the place a call right away. I could taste the biscuit on my tongue. 

\"Chow Chow,\" he answered, and the rest of the phone call was your typical food-ordering phone call. It was quite boring to talk to him, but they can't all be big talkers like me, I s'pose. \"25 minutes,\" he told me. \"Fast food...\" I mumbled to myself ironically. I knew it wasn't gonna be fast food, but I was still pretty excited about how quickly the food was going to be ready since I was so hungry. It was just so exciting that food was going to be ready simply 25 minutes after I left the house. My wife decided to join me on the drive so that we could look at the progress of the construction nearby, and so that she could tell me about her difficult day at work (oh, brother). She can be a little much at times, but driving helps take my mind off things.

I walked into the big empty room that is \"Chow Chow Kitchen,\" and I gulped. I'm not gonna lie, it was a big room and I was intimidated. There was nobody in there. Nobody. Not even workers. Yelp is right! But I understand that not every restaurant is going to be Outback Steakhouse in its opening month. I get it. So anyway, the fella comes up, gives me some styrofoam containers, and says, \"Go to town, Phil.\" So we pulled up to the Metroparks, sat at a picnic table, ate chicken, then threw the bones into the woods. Was wonderful.

But, yum. The chicken was moist-ish, with a cracker-like layer of fried goodiness all around it. The mashed potatoes were very small in portion, which made me mournful; I like to slather my chicken in taters, folks. Slather. The biscuit was dry and awful, but so are all biscuits. It met my low expectations for biscuits, and I was quite pleased about that.

Now, we took our dog with us. Now, our dog is getting pretty old. We're gonna have to put the old gal down soon. She's very tame and no longer needs a leash, so we let her sniff around the park while we ate. But of course, the boys in blue pull up right next to our picnic table and write my crying wife a ticket for having an unleashed dog. I think I might send the bill to Chow Chow.

I went home and had some potty troubles, but I think that was just from stress about the dog. Ah, well. Check out Chow Chow -- was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"12/16/2015 tried the hot chix - I'm not familiar with southern hot chix so I can't compare it - but flabby fried chix skin that can't be right - me no likey - the gumbo was all broth & rice was OK  but was anything else exposed to be in it.kinda Campbells lame. two strikes & your . . . now wait a minute we ain't out just yet people I gotta smoked pulled pork po-boy holy friggin' moley it was de-lic-ous . you have got to try it ! ! ! 2nd best pulled pork I've ever had (I'm 54) only Interstate in Memphis IS better. But son was it close,damn was that good pork - Chow Chow you got some'in here."}
{"text":"I went to chow with the supper club. It's so nice meeting fun people who enjoy trying new restaurants& socializing . As an appetizer to share I had popcorn cheddar curds.  They were light & crispy& very tasty.  It came with a carrot spiced dipping sauce on the side (yum) nice and spicy. I also had the fish & chips.  It was cat fish with panko breading & fresh lightly spiced chips.  The fish portion was plentiful but I wish I had more chips!  Tatar sauce was really good  and it comes with good coleslaw.  I'm definitely coming back for the fish & chips on Friday."}
{"text":"I live in the south for many years and have missed the cuisine. The friendliness reminds me of that down home spirit. If you like spice they have it if you'd like mild they have it.  Mack and cheese are to die for. The dining room is small so if you have a large party consider takeout. I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"It is fantastic that this place has opened on my way home! The ham and bean soup is spicy and delicious, and the chicken is moist and flavorful. I've never had Nashville hot chicken so can't compare, but even if they're different I would be happy to get the hot chicken, as it's spicy and the hilarious white bread makes a great counterpoint. I wish them the best and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Had the regular fried chicken winner dinner this time. Easily some of the best fried chicken I've had. These guys know what they're doing. Mac and cheese was pretty ok. But the chicken is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been to Chow Chow at least 6 times if not more since they opened. I've tried numerous things from each of their seasonal menus and I haven't been disappointed once.  

I've had the fried chicken, po boys, sides, pulled pork, soups, and desserts. 

I believe my favorite item would be the fried rice, pickles and pulled pork.  

I love the fact that the menu changes and I can try new items every few months. I will keep coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Lakewood, Chow Chow! We have been waiting for some southern/soul food here on the West Side. Chow Chow had all the southern comfort foods on the menu. As mentioned before, it'd be wise to call at least 20 minutes ahead. I called before I got off work and swiftly picked up 25 minutes later. There were about a handful of folks waiting to pick up their order. 

I couldn't decide between the Winner Dinner fried chicken or one of the Po'boys. After a coin flip I went with the Po'boys. Then another coin flip between the two Po'boys that sounded the best to me. I ordered the bangers and beans w/ chips. The Po'boy came on a nice roll with a sliced down the middle andouille sausage tipped with coleslaw and surrounded on BBQ baked beans. There wasn't much coleslaw to cool, but still a nice compliment. The beans got a bit messy, but it came with a fork so all is well. 

What I was pleasantly surprised with was the chips that came as a side. I was expecting just regular chips, but they were homemade!!! Excitement level = 10!

The sausage and a really good spice to it and the beans did as well. It was definitely a comfort meal after a long day at work! I cannot wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I don't start off reviews like this but this place was ridiculously good. I had the Winner Dinner with an extra side of hush puppies. The total bill was $11.50 ($7.50 for the Winner Dinner and $4.00 for the hush puppies) which was pretty cheap for the amount of food you get. The dinner is a jumbo fried chicken breast, mac and cheese, and a biscuit with gravy. All of the for $7.50 is pretty cheap. The fried chicken was overall the best fried chicken I've eaten, the mac and cheese & biscuit were also really good. The hush puppies were really good in the lemon aioli. My only gripe is that you only get 3 (jumbo) hush puppies for $4.00. Overall I really really enjoyed this place and   will definitely grab some food here again. Keep in mind that this place is take-out only and calling ahead for takeout is a good idea."}
{"text":"I'm glad I got to fit this place in before their move next month.  Hopefully they keep their food the same because it is delicious, greasy, cheesy comfort food.  I got to enjoy their biscuits with peppery gravy, cheese drenched mac and cheese, and super tasty chicken fried pierogies.  The next place will start off with an instant upgrade: a restroom.  Good luck in your new place!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious and we will definitely be back again. Special tip: they do not have a public restroom, so wash your hands before you come or get take out. We will definitely be back for more hot chicken and fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot chicken for Nashville style in Ohio . It was hot n spicy and good flavor. Very friendly mate working. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"If you like southern cooking, of any kind.  I highly recommend you stop by this place.  They have most of the greatest hits of southern cooking, such as gumbo, buttermilk fried chicken, fried shaved catfish, Nashville hot chicken, etc.

We went opening night (I believe just an hour after their initial open) I got the hot chicken with a side of gumbo and my girlfriend got the buttermilk chicken and they were amazing.  My girlfriend claims it's some of the best fried chicken she has ever had, though I still think that claim still lays with Mahall's.  But it's definitely up there as a possible 2nd.

Only complaint was that we had a wait a while for our food.  But it was all made fresh to order (and fried chicken takes a while, which everyone there was ordering).  And the fact it was their opening night, I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they will work the kinks out over time.  Also the prices are very very reasonable for the quality of food you get back.  Well worth it.

Also note there are only 2 tables as it is meant to be a place you order and then take back home or to work, so I recommend maybe ordering ahead.  

I can easily seeing this becoming a staple of Lakewood's food scene."}
{"text":"Loved how many veg options there are. The cheese curds were delicious. The smoked peach iced tea was too. The tofu po boy was good but I didn't love the BBQ sauce. The guys working could not have been nicer."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I came across this place: a hand painted sign of a chicken that was breathing fire adorned the front sidewalk advertising hot chicken. Upon entering, my hungry and eager stomach waiting to be filled couldn't believe it's \"eyes\" as I looked at the menu filled with tantalizing spins on classic soul food items...listing everything from smoked salmon deviled eggs to hush puppies. I wanted it all, but I sufficed with a hot chicken dinner for me, a fish and chip dinner for the man, and mac and cheese, gumbo, and hot fries to share. 

Unfortunately, my excitement went away as I was left unimpressed with the whole meal. Most of my contention was that everything from the hot chicken to the hot fries to the mac and cheese was bland. There was little to no salt or flavor on any of these items. The mac and cheese was not cheesy or velvety in texture, and I suspect too much flour was added to the roux, leaving it with a very pasty texture. Secondly, the hot chicken dinner consisted of a bone in thigh and a drumstick, in addition to a slice of white bread and approximately a four ounce cup of average, run-of-the-mill coleslaw. The amount of meat I managed to pick off of the chicken was approximately five ounces of edible meat...all for $9. My boyfriend was pleased with the gumbo and his fish and chip dinner, which I agreed to after I sampled a few of his bites.

My consensus is that I may try Chow Chow again one day, but I'm not so sure as I was left really unimpressed with the execution of the dishes and flavors. 

*They are moving to a new location in the Gordon Square district and will be open there at the end of April, according to a very friendly employee. *"}
{"text":"I had the succotash and it is delicious. The menu is fairly simple. It does have a nice Louisiana lean to the food without adhering strictly to tradition. The young lady that took care of me was very nice and knowledgeable. One turn off is eating out of a box when I'm dining in. Over all a very good experience."}
{"text":"We got the winner dinner. Good breading and juicy. The gravy was a little off, but maybe it was just a bad batch or that was the way it was supposed to taste. Can't wait to try out more items. Also the Mac and cheese side dish is on point."}
{"text":"I typically review really good or really bad experiences.

Chow Chow was a really good experience- check them out!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!
Grabbed takeout for the wife and I and it was fantastic!
She had the Hot Chicken and was prepared exactly like it is in Nashville. I ordered the Popcorn Pork (I think it's called West City Pork), and that was great too. 

My only issue is I couldn't find the menu online, I used the pic someone posted on here. 

They really could use a website/Facebook page to help get the word out."}
{"text":"This just ranked as one of our Top 5 favorite places in NEO! Our first experience at ChowChow was exceptional! Katie greeted us and kindly walked us through all the items on the menu and just what made them so unique and added to their signature flavor. Then after we ordered, the tastes and quality of our meal even exceeded the quality customer service. Still raving about the fried rice (with a perfectly fried egg on top),the poboy, and the fish dinner - as foodies we will be back soon to savor and try many more me items. A must try for any Clevelander!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I tried the winner dinner and smoked pork po'boy.  Both were bangin!  The staff was super nice and friendly.  I'm going back for more!"}
{"text":"This place has moved into the kitchen at the Parkview Tavern located on W 58th! Oh happy day! I was so bummed when they closed.... Now I can get my hot chicken and cheddar curds again!!

On with the review. I am no soul food critic, but this place speaks to your inner self, and fluently at that! We ordered The Pulled Pork PoBoy, Winner Dinner, Cheddar Curds, Gumbo, and Salmon Hush Puppies.  Every item came out cooked perfectly.

The cheddar cheese curds are subtle and perfectly battered. The Winner Chicken dinner was flavorful and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   
The pulled pork PoBoy came with fresh made thick cut chips. Ohhhhhhh yeahhhhhh!!!!!! (I could just order these for the rest of my life!)
The Salmon hush puppies were simply the best hush puppies I have ever enjoyed. Just the right hint of salmon without losing their identity.

The BBQ sauce on the PoBoy was a little zippy if you prefer a milder sauce, but had plenty of flavor to mesh with the heat.

This place gets 4.6 stars if only for their shortage of blander fare for my less adventurous companions."}
{"text":"Here's a first good sign. When the menu is  so inviting that you order more food than humanly possible to eat. That is exactly what happened to us at Chow Chow...and then we added one more dish.

Despite the box of food that went home with us, we sampled everything and found everything great. Gumbo, catfish, fried chicken, Mac & Cheese, chicken fried sausage(!) Here's the real kicker. Each of us still has a wish list from the menu equally long!

A few moments after the food is handed over, you'll forget your eating out of a styrofoam box with plastic utensils and imagine yourself in a little roadside diner someplace in Alabama. Go and transport yourself south. You'll enjoy the trip!"}
{"text":"Review is based only on the hot chicken.  It had absolutely zero flavor. The chicken was not seasoned at all, the hot oil added no flavor either.  Chicken had a decent crunch, but,  that's about the only positive part of that order. 
Staff is super nice and the reason for the third star."}
{"text":"Came with my wife and 2 teen kids. Hip, small place. In a part of town where authentic southern style food is hard to find, this place is a gem. Had the MC pig boi and loved every finger licking bite. Sampled the winner dinner and it was just as good.

Highly recommend. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I don't eat meat so my options are limited. Almost everything I have got either the food had an odd after taste or it was too spicy to eat. There is no real way of finding s current menu."}
{"text":"the hot chicken is good, the mac n cheese, hushpuppies and cole slaw are very bland and i wasn't a big fan of the bread crumbs on top.  im not sure if \"soul food\" is the category of food they offer, but i was a bit underwhelmed.  may give it another try w different items..."}
{"text":"So, I'm probably gonna get some hate mail for this review seeing as how everyone seems to be loving all over the fried chicken here. I'll take my chances. In a nutshell, Chow Chow was a somewhat disappointing experience with a few highlights and a menu with other options that just might have us returning.

Gripes of Note: 
No bathroom. None. Drain that bladder before you arrive if you're planning to dine in.

They only offer sweetened teas and damn, the one we had (the smokey peach, which had a wonderful flavor) was super sweet. You could taste the beetus in it.

Plastic utensils that couldn't cut their way out of a greasy paper bag. How about an upgrade for folks dining in?

Styrofoam containers? Really? In 2016/nearly 2017?

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, shall we get on with it?

The Grub: A Cleveland-area take on soul food, i.e. Southern comfort food. Not sure what soul food is? It's basically the reason the south leads the nation in obesity and diabetes and it tastes damn good.

Setting the scene - 5:30ish, Thursday, a rather unseasonably warm late December in Lakewood. We opted to dine in. We were unaware that everything was made to order. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready. Bring something to do or someone to talk to if you plan to wait.

We parked across the street, that was free and convenient, and ambled out way over to Chow Chow. No other customers in site. The place smells amazing, smoky, meaty, a hint of fryer grease. It's really a take-out joint first, as evidenced by the rather sparse accommodations, but there are a couple tables for seated noshing. We were immediately greeted by one of the two guys working that night. Friendly, attentive. So far so good.

We took a few minutes to look over the wall-hangings before making our selections - Winner Dinner for me, mac and cheese as the side of choice. Fried catfish dinner for the wife. We shared an order of hush puppies.

The biggest disappointment for me was the fried chicken. I'm no fried chicken snob, really. But with everyone else raving about the stuff, I had my expectations heightened. The breading on this chicken was very thick and tough to bite through. It also came off of the pieces of chicken in large, solid chunks that still retained the shape of the chicken they once enrobed. Seriously, I think it was about a quarter inch thick. It also didn't really stick to the skin, so it separated and left behind the rather unappetizing, rubbery dermis (that visual is free). The seasoning on the breading was tasty and had a nice level of salt (I prefer more cayenne), it just didn't work execution wise. The meat was good, so that's positive. It was tender, juicy, greasy (I got a thigh and drumstick in my dinner) and everything it should be. As for the side, the mac and cheese side was yummy and cheesy but also very salty. It was also pretty mushy. Could have used some crunch is all I'm sayin'. The pickles served on top of the chicken were tasty, mildly acidic, and a bit sweet.

Probably the highlight of the meal, my wife loved her fish and chips. Two large, crispy, golden, fried fillets of catfish served atop a bed of thin and crispy house-made tater chips and a side of creamy slaw. Damn was this some good fish. Flaky, tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. The slaw wasn't really all that creamy, kind of dry actually, and, be warned, it packs some heat. The scorched dill tartar was also delicious.

The hushpuppies, well, not much to say about them really. Three golf-ball sized cornbread pups fried a perfect golden brown and served with a side of the charred lemon tartar sauce. They were crunchy outside with moist and flavorful innards. Just get 'em.

So there you have it. We were looking forward to some soul food and because other Yelpers were so hot on this place, we were expecting a great deal. Just didn't quite hit all those high notes that everyone else heard. There are some other things on the menu that I really wanna try, like the smoked pork po boy, gumbo and chicken fried sausage, so we'll probably be back at some point. Probably won't go for the chicken again, though."}
{"text":"First time at Chow Chow Kitchen after a suggestion from a friend. It is a take out kind of place with a few table to sit. The owner was very friendly / helpful and walked me through fan favorite menu items. I chose the Salmon Hash Po'Boy with chips and a peach sweet tea. The Po'Boy was delicious and huge! In could had a giant bowl of just that hash and been so satisfied. The house made chips also fantastic... I wanted more! It is a messy meal but amazing. The owner was attentive and made sure I was happy with my meal. I will defiantly suggestion Chow Chow to my friends and look forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Was really excited to see this type of place pop up in Lakewood.  Had the hot chicken, mac and cheese, and gumbo.  All 3 were awesome and I can't wait to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food at a pretty good price. It's kind of small on the inside so you're better off taking it to go or taking it to Bottlehouse down the street. You can obviously eat there but the seats are rather uncomfortable. The hot fries are amazing and somehow they're still crunchy the next day even if you refrigerate them"}
{"text":"Alright, as I am sitting here in a food coma with my pants unbuttoned, I have to update my review for Chow Chow. I think if you go to a place so frequently that you've had most of the menu and the employees know your name, then you should upgrade them to five stars cause there's obviously something about their food that keeps bringing you back. Sure there are a couple things I could nitpick about, but for the most part I really dig this place and look forward to what they'll come up with in the seasonal menus.

{"text":"Nashville Hot Chicken dinner for $7.50.  As far as dining deals go, this place is near the top.

As for the food, it's not terribly fancy.  The chicken is cooked to order (and good), the mac & cheese is better than it looks, but the biscuit and gravy are bleh.  I would like to try some of the other items on the menu to see if these guys are a one-trick pony or not.

Just another cool spot in Lakewood worth checking out."}
{"text":"Chow Chow is a cool Southern food takeout place on Madison Avenue in Lakewood.  Walk in and there is a cool kind of older Southern vibe from the dark wood, the large menu board and the decorations.  There are 4 tables, but its primarily takeout.  Once you make your decision you place your order at the large window, pay and wait for the food to come out.

I had the Fish and Chips.  I got a very large portion of perfectly fried catfish; the fish was tender and sweet with a crunchy coating.  They manage to make this still feel light and completely free of any excess oil.  The generous portion of homemade potato chips were crisp and slightly salty, very nice.  I was expecting something tangy from the charred lemon tarter sauce, while a nice rendition of tarter sauce, I failed to find anything unique in the flavor profile.  The slaw was also nice, but nothing unique or special.

Overall the main items were perfected versions of fried catfish and chips; the side items were OK, but nothing special; the portion size was very generous and could easily be shared by two people.

I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Way disappointed. :(  First off, sodium overload on everything we ordered.  and we love salt.  To the point it makes you cringe while eating.  Second, they nickel and dime you for everything and no substitutions of sides. We ordered: catfish dinner, Winner Chicken, Gumbo and salmon appetizer and a side of cajun rice with an egg on top($1.50 for a fricken egg?)  In addition to the sodium, the catfish was very bottom feed tasting.  What this means is, fresh catfish tastes fresh, catfish that is going bad or gone bad has a terrible taste, like the bottom of an ocean and tastes dirty.  That is what this catfish tasted like.  When we asked for an extra side of sauce, everything is an extra 50 cents.  That's fine when the addition is filled.  We checked and it was less than a tablespoon.  Their response for every NO we can't: \"We make everything in house\".  fine; great. but don't fight with the customer.  We don't mind paying extra, but you should get what you pay for.

Onto the \"Winner Chicken\".  It's 1 piece of chicken mashers, very little gravy and a dry biscuit.  the dinner calls for gravy and there was little.  Again asking for extra will cost you and a 50 cent portion is supposed to be a 2 oz side but actually, less than half that.  Total attitude when I questioned.

OMG, the salt level in everything is insanely too much, even the gravy.  Cringeworthy.  Normally, with an experience such as this I'd call the restaurant to discuss with the manager.  However not here as they gave us such attitude, making us feel like they are doing us a favor.  whatever!  will not go back; just hope we don't keel over from sodium bombs tomorrow.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.  I tried Winner Dinner (Chicken was what dreams are made of.  Really crispy and juicy.  I was craving my next helping before I finished the first.  The Mac, which has some questionable reviews, was really good I thought!  More of a creamy sauce, rather than stringy cheese, but good flavor and a good portion in the dinner.)  I tried the Number 1 Fried Rice.  It has some spice and really great flavor!  And the portion was enough for 2.  There was a lot going on in a great way.  Also tried the house fries which are spicy jojos.  Those were great too but really spicy!  But also I'm a wimp.  In conclsion, I will definitely be back for more chicken and mac.  I heard the pierogies are the best thing on the menu.  It's pretty small inside, but still a few tables if you want to dine in. They deliver too!  This is a solid restaurant and I wish them nothing but success!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try yet another recommended Fried Chicken spot in Lakewood while on my Staycation & driving over from the Eastside. Here's a picture of the uniquely horrible Mac & Cheese & piece of breast that was microwaved for 3 minutes then cut. (My wife ate the leg) I unknowingly cut a small piece & immediately tasted the rawness  before looking at it. If I get sick I want full reimbursement for this & the gumbo I refuse to eat. INFUGGINGEDIBLE (hope I don't get sick)

Update: Neither of us got sick & the owner contacted me via fb IM to apologize & offer me a free meal upon my next visit."}
{"text":"My son suggested we finally try this new place. We ordered a lil bit of everything...Winner Dinner, Hot chicken, ham & bean soup, fried perogies, mac & cheese. All were great. The hot chicken was defintely HOT! And for those who like spicy fried chicken, they have an even hotter hot chicken! Best items we both agreed on were: mac & cheese, mashed taters & gravy, coleslaw, and the ham & bean soup. We will defintely be back to try their po boys and fish."}
{"text":"Highly, highly recommend. My BF got the Hot Chicken Dinner, and I got the Chicken Winner Dinner - both were superb. I suggest getting the smoked peach sweet tea too - everything was delicious. Only downside was that it's not really a sit down place like I thought - you go up, order, and then they bring it out to you. It did not affect my willingness to return though! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pig,Potato,Pickles... on the new winter menu, my lord... GOLDMINE!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:15 pm to place a takeout order and was met with friendly service. I ended up getting the hot chicken because I love spicy food, and subbed the coleslaw for the jojos with cheese (I ended up regretting this a bit later). I ate some gumbo while I waited for my chicken and very much enjoyed it. Nice heat level, I had to take breaks between bites. The roux was dark and deeply flavored, and the serving size is great for the price.

Once I got the rest of my order and hurried out to my car so I could take a peek at my chicken - the breast was HUGE and absolutely beautiful. I munched on my jojos on my way home (they were delicious, both dipped in the cheese and standalone), and then decided to break a piece of the breading off my chicken and give it a try. It was wonderfully crispy and I loved the mixture of spices, it tasted slightly sweet even... then about 30 seconds later my mouth started to burn. And I mean BURN. Water didn't help but luckily I had a banana in my car, so I half-peeled it and stuck it in my mouth while I was driving. Not a great look but the burning subsided after a couple minutes. Now I get why you need the coleslaw.

Once I got home, I was able to more carefully dismantle my chicken and hone in on the meat to breading ratio so my mouth wasn't crying. The chicken was super moist and tender on the inside, perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back to try more, but I doubt I'll be able to keep myself from that torturous hot chicken. So worth the pain."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after a friend raved. Ordered the tofu po boy. Was still hot when I brought it home too Parma so that's a plus. It was good but I'll get a side of sauce next time. Hot fries were spicy!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan option for a place you wouldn't expect a vegan option. Portions vs price were generous! The hand painted menu and signs all over the shop were a great touch. The others in my group enjoyed their dinners as well, we shall return! TIP: everything is super spicy even for people who like spicy food, word of caution"}
{"text":"This is the second time we ate here, both have been via take-out. Working a later shift, it was much appreciated when they were super nice about us placing a call-in order 20 minutes before close. 
Tried the hot chicken this time with waffles & syrup. Delicious!! The skin was spicy with a hint of sweet. 
According to the boyfriend, the mashed potatoes are what complete the meal. 

Definitely recommend eating here, especially if you don't mind spice.
And yes, the smores taco is what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Lakewood with an awesome Southern style offering. Went with the pork po boy and was not let down. House chips are crisp and well seasoned. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Lakewood that is already vibrant in the food scene. Basically a takeout place for those who want to dine in though. They do have tables, but you basically get takeout containers and plastic forks. 

I'm not normally a fan of sweet tea, but they are very very good. Fresh and bold full body taste. We got a few things to sample - salmon hush puppies, mashed potato, pork sandwich, and gumbo. All very good. Do agreed with the other reviewer that some more bbq sauce on the sandwich would be great. Portion of the items we got is not generous as the other reviewer has mentioned. Thought it might be only the case for dinner plates. Definitely would go back for the friend chicken which are supposed to be the signature. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars but that isn't an option, so 4 stars it is. I had the smoky pulled pork po' boy which came with homemade chips. The meat was smoky deliciousness but I think I would've liked a tiny bit of BBQ sauce on it. No biggie; it still made my taste buds dance! The chips were perfectly cooked and seasoned. So good. So very, very good. I also got a side of hot fries. The serving size looked a little paltry in the takeout container, but there were six of them, and really, that's more than enough if you're also getting a sandwich or dinner. They were cooked perfectly: seasoned crunchy scrumptiousness on the outside and potato-y soft goodness on the inside. The s'more taco, while looked small, really, is more than enough for one,  or even to share with someone if you just want a little taste of dessert après dinner.
Small and very clean interior, with a few tables if you're eating in. Super friendly cashier/order taker. For sure call ahead and order if you can, because it takes awhile to get your order, but that's not from lack of efficient workers; you can see them in the back, non-stop hustling, preparing the orders.
Looking forward to more visits and tasting more menu items!! Everything on the menu looks so, so good.
Great addition to Lakewood!! Best of luck to you, Chow Chow!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE supporting local businesses but CHOW CHOW missed the mark. After reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this place. I ended up being quite disappointed though.. 

1) My chicken was pretty bland. Both meat & batter (tasted like basic salt&pepper seasoning) My bisquit was fine, pretty moist but small. The gravy was too salty but lacked additional seasoning. The Mac 'N Cheese was bland (and not baked by the way if some people prefer baked)
2) Hot Chicken sub Waffles - it only comes with 2 pieces of waffles. And the chicken was also bland. 

For $7.50 each, Its sad to say I would rather get a chicken dinner from Popeye's instead. I really wanted to like this place.."}
{"text":"Had the MC Pig Boi. (Emcee, not Mick).  The Mac and cheese was amazing, the pulled pork was some of the best I have ever had, but for the love of Lakewood, ditch the toasted piece of Wonder bread and go down the street and get me a nice thick slice of some Breadsmith!   That would have added the final touch of home made deliciousness that would make this dish perfect!"}
{"text":"Chow Chow was \"awesome, awesome\"! Has someone made that joke already?
Regardless....what's not to like? Fried chicken? Good. Mac n' Cheese? Good. Mashed potatoes? GOOOOD!

First I would like to say, how much I love the \"order up\" counter and menu signs. It gives you the feel of ordering from a stand off the side of a dirt country road but with all the comforts of an actual restaurant. We did manage to snag a table but I can imagine it gets really busy and take-out is the way to go. 

The BBQ pulled pork with mac n' cheese was to die for. Literally, so much cheese it probably took a couple months off my life....which I'm totally fine with. The portion was too much for me to finish but I wouldn't say it was overly huge. I think for most people it would be a perfect styrofoam container full. Also on the list of things Teej tried at this establishment...coleslaw and succotash hash! The coleslaw had a spicy kick to it, very tasty. Never having tried succotash before, I have nothing to compare this to. As far as I'm concerned though, it was delicious!

My only complaint was the pricing. It seemed a little high for a place that is primarily take-out and only uses plastic/styrophoam."}
{"text":"Seeing as they won't be around much longer a review may not be that influential, but they are taking their menu to one of my favorite bars, Parkview in late April. We thought we were going to take our food to go but ended up eating in the small Lakewood store front. We had Mac and cheese, fried pierogis and biscuits and gravy. The Mac and cheese wasn't bad, super cheesy almost velvetta like but I enjoyed it. The pierogis were good, they were like mashed potatoes covered in a fried chicken battered pierogi shell. The biscuits and gravy were a disappointment, three biscuits with a small cup of watery gravy that was super meaty. It want bad for a quick bite I will be interested to see how they do at Parkview and what changes they might bring to their menu."}
{"text":"Everything is great. I love the fish n chips dinner, salmon hash poboy and soft pretzel with nacho cheese. Owner and staff are very friendly. They are really passionate about good food. Eat here always."}
{"text":"If not for the tea, 3 stars. The charred lemon iced tea is easily in my top 5 menu items in the city. I don't even like sweet tea. Repeat I do not like sweet tea and yet I LOVE this damn tea! I'll call it sweetened iced tea, as opposed to traditional southern-style rot-your-teeth-out sweet tea which is WAY too sweet for me. One of my coworkers who has joined us a couple of times also now will not shut up about the lemon tea! Seriously it is SO GOOD. 

We've had take out several times from Chow Chow and have overall been happy. We have also had groups over and gotten take out for the crowd a couple of times recently. Everyone has been pretty happy with their meals each time and it's very reasonably priced in my opinion. 

Great things: 
1. Cheese curds (trust me I'm a cheesehead). Good portion of fried curds and with the hot oil they are very tasty. 
2. Wet fries - pretty spicy for my taste but people in our group raved about them. 
3. Charred lemon sweet tea - perhaps you've heard me mention this elsewhere. Get it, you will not regret it. The smoked peach flavor is also good but not in the same league as the lemon. 
4. Po boys are all great. Some unique things here too - not just your usual shrimp. Last time I had the fried chicken po boy with hot oil and it was delicious. 
5.  Overall the menu is pretty spicy - not ridiculously so but if you like really mild things you won't have a ton of options here. That's just right for us so we really like the menu overall.

Not outstanding due to a couple of factors: 
1. Sides are small for the price - $3 each
2. Mac and cheese had decent flavor but the noodles were very mushy - definitely had been sitting around for a long time. 
3. I just don't love the fried chicken dinner  - yes I know it's fried chicken but it shouldn't be that greasy.
4. We've ordered at 8pm on a Saturday night and they have been out of a few items. Once even out of the tea! :( 

Overall I'd definitely recommend Chow Chow. There are some unique items on the menu that you can't get at many places around here and which are quite tasty. I would recommend you try those items rather than the more common ones (mac and cheese, fried chicken) as those are done better elsewhere."}
{"text":"OMG! The food at this place is amazing! Such good quality of ingredients and taste. Definitely well prepared food. The staff is awesome and super friendly. The only thing I wish is that you can eat there and set of only doing takeout."}
{"text":"What a terrific find this was! I'd seen a review in the Cleveland magazine. Decided to give it a try. The chicken was great! Real fried chicken. Very simple place, not many eat in seats, no frills, just amazing chicken. Would love to see them add greens...we would then be bordering on perfection. 
Most definitely a do over and over!!"}
{"text":"Wife was in the mood for some fried chicken, so here we are. 

I had the Hot Chicken, Nashville style. Holy hell, it was one of the spiciest things I've eaten! But, delicious spicy. Even though I was crying as I ate, I couldn't stop. It was absolutely delicious. One minor downside was the chicken itself was a little dry - but it moistened right up from my tears. 

I also had a side of the Cajun rice which was incredible. It, too, was on the spicy side but I couldn't tell exactly how spicy since I was already sobbing from the Hot Chicken. 

My wife enjoyed her Winner Dinner, but felt the cheese curds were a bit too battered for her liking. 

My only suggestion is that they need a website (or at least a page) that shows their menu. I ordered by phone and was only able to find the menu on a photo on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mac and cheese I have had for its price. Really good fried chicken Po Boy. I will definitely be a returning customer when I am in the area.  Just tried the Winner Dinner on 1/2/16. Really good."}
{"text":"Chow Chow is amazing. Joe is a food wizard. The pickles are the best pickles you'll ever have. The grilled cheese is an explosion of delicliousness with the most perfectly cooked fried egg on it waiting to yolk it up when you take a bite. I dream about the coleslaw. I want a vat of deviled egg filling. If I'm having a long day and just feel overworked, this is the first place I think of when I need food. The best part of it is that they deliver too! Every item I have tried has been perfection."}
{"text":"It was a long path for me to arrive before a plate of Nashville style hot chicken. Whatever path you take in life to get here enjoy the destination.

I grew up eating Southern food prepared by my grandmother in the style of the Ozark mountains. I moved around a lot and lived in Washington, D.C., New York, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Chicago, and most recently Los Angeles. It was in a recent L.A. Weekly article that I learned such a thing as Nashville Hot Chicken existed. I immediately craved it and begin hatching a plan to get to Nashville. Imagine my surprise when my first plate of Nashville style hot chicken presented itself to me in Cleveland thanks to an article on the top hottest restaurants in Cleveland published in December 2015 that said Chow Chow was worth it's hog fat in Southern cuisine.

I boldly ordered the dish extra hot clarifying that I like my Indian and Thai food spicy. I demurred and deferred to accepting it hot after being warned that a couple recently made a similar claim and then after trying the regular hot said if what they meant by spicy was a 5 on a 10 point scale, this hot chicken was a 7. I also ordered the hot, not extra hot, and heartily agree.

It was delicious and unique, but I had to pace bites 60 seconds apart to let my mouth cool off before the next assault. It was intense, but still flavorful. It did not devolve into the tongue numbing Scoville Scorcher torture of your irreverent Ghost Pepper hot sauces.

You'll want the sweet tea to help soothe your lips and mouth after each bite as you work your way through the plump bone in chicken breast.  

Chow Chow doesn't serve alcohol as they want to focus on the food. However they will refer you to Richland Bar down the block which allows outside food. So you can get your Nashville style hot chicken on white bread with coleslaw in one styrofoam container and your hush puppies in another and walk your way to your watering hole which exactly what I did.

Let me warn you that beer only makes the flames rise higher, so bring a cup of sweet tea with you to protect your mouth."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with the supper club.  Ordered the pinto bean and ham soup and the catfish dinner.  The bean soup was thick, tasty and had quite a spicy kick to it.  I sure wish I had cornbread to go with it to balance out the heat.  The catfish dinner included several very thin & crispy pieces of deep fried catfish, homemade chips, & coleslaw.  The dinners are made to order and served hot.  The fish and chips were not greasy at all, which is a big plus. The catfish was very thinly sliced so you did not get as much fish flavor as the breading taste. It still was good though.  Coleslaw was a little spicy, but really tasty.  I think they may have put horseradish in it?
This is a to-go restaurant, but they allowed us to sit at the tables to eat.  
The steady traffic of customers kept the staff busy, so the kitchen got a little backed up.  The two person staff was working hard. Ordered a to-go winner chicken dinner and it took approx. 40 minutes to get.  
NOTE:  If you are looking to make healthy eating choices, this place is not for you.  Almost everything on the menu is deep fried. 
Overall a good solid choice when you are craving some homemade comfort fried food.  I give it a 3.5 star rating, rounded to 4.
Update:  Hubby gave feedback on his winner dinner.  He loved the mac n cheese and said the chicken was good too.  He is not a white meat chicken guy usually, but said this one was very moist.  Also, commented that the ham & bean soup was \"wild\".  Translation, spicy but good.  He is a fan!"}
{"text":"If deep fried comfort food is what you seek, Chow Chow is where to find it. Now I'll admit that for me more than anyone, it's really difficult to disappoint when it comes to anything deep friend. However I will say, this place puts a creative spin on southern food which I think anyone that has a keen love of hot sauce will appreciate. It's not necessarily the most traditional, but the fusion aspect is done quite well here, only incorporating ingredients that have a place and purpose. While items like the fish and chips are pretty straightforward, albeit well done, others like the bbq pork po-boys and hush puppies with a charred lemon tartar sauce are done a little differently, but with an interesting twist. 
A few things to note, in general, this place is pretty much take-out only, BUT they do have a few tables and chairs for folks to sit and eat if they wanted to. I came with the Yelp supper club, there were about 8 or 9 of us and we were able to all sit with space left over for other guests. If you plan on coming and sitting in with a group though, I would definitely call ahead. Also to note, it seemed to me that they did get quite backed up with take-out orders, to the point where some of the people in our group had to wait 40 minutes for their chicken dinner. Now normally their Winner Dinner takes 20 minutes to cook, but they were short staffed that evening, so it could have been a combination of that plus having a limited number of fryers. Either way, don't be surprised if your take-out order takes longer than you would normally expect for a take-out place. It slightly bothers me that they only serve food in styrofoam containers with plastic cutlery, but again, given that this place is take-out only, I really can't expect much more. 
Service was excellent; despite the fact that the front was slammed and they were short staffed, the girl at the counter was still extremely patient and kind with us, and took great care of our group, especially considering it really isn't a sit down place. 
All in all, I'm eager to come back here. The food really is quite delicious, although it's probably not something you'd want to eat on the regular due to the fact that they don't really have any healthy options, it does make for a nice treat!"}
