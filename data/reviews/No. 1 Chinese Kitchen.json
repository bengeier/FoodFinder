{"text":"Not the best Chinese in the world but best place around that is fast food Chinese. My wife and i have tried several places around and this one is the best. This is our place to go."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  We sat down and no one was in the restaurant and waited for the waitress to come to the table for about 10 minutes.  So I went to the counter and she very rudely told us we  were to oder at counter. Then I tried to ask a couple of questions regarding the menu and she laughed at me and in a very condescending demeaning way and answered me while laughing.  She then was talking about me to the other people working their about me like I was a stupid person. I have never been so humiliated and they should not be in business working with the general public in a customer service business. I highly recommend that no one ever go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Unlike other Chinese restaurant, it's not over seasoning. We tried the wonton soup and General Tsao's chicken. It was very delicious."}
{"text":"Best chinese in the kent area. I have been going here for over a year. The food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese place in the area (and we have tried them all). Only drawback is the staff is incredibly rude, but who cares once you get the food. You get a lot for what you pay for and it's pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout when I first moved here 3 years ago and needed a moving break for some lunch. My dad is kind of a Chinese takeout professional so when he was raving about it, I knew it was good. I had orange chicken then. I probably get takeout from here once a month now. I switch it up between orange chicken, sesame chicken, Szechuan chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Sometimes I add in the delicious hot and sour soup or the crab Rangoon. Everything is always hot and delicious, and I'm happy to say I've never encountered any mystery meat bites like you sometimes get with Chinese takeout. Highly recommend #1."}
{"text":"Still pretty solid food. But not always as jaw dropping as that first review.   The consistency can be odd here. Sometimes the breaded chicken bits taste a little overdone... I don't know a better way to describe it. It's generally fine but when that quality dip hits, it hits hard.  Still a decent go to for a quick dinner but if I want something a little more consistent I'll venture out more."}
{"text":"Great food! Always hot and fresh! Much better than your run of the mill mini-mall Chinese food!"}
{"text":"They have the best fried rice that I've had around the Akron area. Their egg rolls are really good too."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving... this is not as cookie cutter as the clip art menu / wall display leads one to believe.  Located in the shopping center across from the Super Walmart this small end unit crams rather nice high backed chairs into the front and 2 drink coolers next to the ordering counter. Not the best place to take a large group, but comfortable for couples and families of 4.  When I called they gave me the standard \"10 to 15 min\" and I was not surprised that it took closer to 45 for them to finish... unfortunately they were still giving out the same \"10 to 15 min\" line while I was waiting... bit that turned out to be the only thing wrong with a really unique meal.  Fried Dumplings... not your standard commercially prepared dumpling... much more ginger, lighter / looser filling with a nice thin dough.  General Tso's Chicken... very lightly breaded... nice garlic flavor to a sauce that wasn't overly sweet... mostly thigh meat... really moist  Kung Bao Chicken... lots of celery and peanuts... almost no breading... really interesting sauce... I could taste some hoisin, oyster and I think plum... mostly thigh meat... diced to match the cut of the celery and about the size of the peanuts... really moist and flavorful.  All of the hot red peppers in the entrees were large enough to fish out.  Fried Rice - small pieces of onion, sprouts, English peas and carrot cubes... but even the clearly processed peas and carrots were tasty and were not mushy.  Lunch Special portion size was big enough for 2 meals easily and came in microwaveable bowls."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese takeout. Even on busy nights they have our order done in 10-15 min max. Very reasonably priced for the portions. We have tried a few things that were very bland, but overall this is our go-to when we want Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you live in the Kent area, this is definitely the place to go for Chinese take out. I've seen people eating inside before, but the place is so small I can image you'll most likely feel very on display to all the customers coming to pick up their orders.  The food is always super fresh and they have good vegetarian options as well. Most notably, the General Tso's tofu is very good! Even my non-vegetarian friend has been ordering it every time after having a taste of mine. Their egg rolls are so good too, you can't just get one.  One thing that bothers me is every time I go there, the lady at the front desk is on the phone with headphones in the whole time while completing my transaction and doesn't say a word to me. She often just takes my money, hands me my food, then turns to go back into the kitchen to continue her conversation. No thank you or have a nice day. Definitely needs to work on customer service!"}
{"text":"This is our preferred Chinese in this area. We order take out from here at least once a month. Food is great, yeah the kid at the register is not the friendliest but would you be working all the time at his age, LOL. The food is normally great, we got some old (rubbery) chicken once but it's not the norm. It's usually always good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here and it was so yummy! Everything was on point! Customer service was not the greatest, but from my experience, its not good at any Asian style Restaurant, I think it's a cultural thing and they can come across as rude, but really aren't!"}
{"text":"If this was 2012 I would have given all 5 stars. Now,  im not sure if 1 star is even worth it. The taste of food has gone down hill tremendously!! Customer Service is terrible as well, I don't appreciate getting attitude when I'm asking about a dish. .especially when there is no one else in the restaurant. Sweeping the floor right next to our table was disgusting too! I don't appreciate dust in my food. Then they start screaming at each other in Chinese extremely loudly.  Lastly, we were in the middle of our meal and the middle of a TV show when they decided to change it to the news.....will NOT be going back!!!"}
{"text":"We won't go anywhere else for Chinese take out in the area. The food is always fresh and delicious! The staff isn't that polite but honestly I don't care as long as they get everything right"}
{"text":"Most Chinese restaurants have similar menus and similar food.  This place serves all the classic Cantonese take out items we are accustomed to, but at a much better, much fresher and authentic version.  Everything I've had is consistent and delicious. I feel fortunate to have this place so close"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I love the egg rolls. The place is more take out than eat in.If you plan on a sit down restaurant don't go here. Take out food is delicious. Not the prettiest place but the staff is nice and the food is good tasting and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I live not too far from here. It's like the only Chinese take-out around without having to drive to campus area restaurants. I like that the food is fresh when I get it and not re-heated or fried (yeah, places do this), and that even if you call 20-30 minutes before closing, you can get a great meal, not crappy stuff they are going to throw away anyway when they close. I would say that the 4 stars is generous as it sucks that they are open until 10pm! And then only 11pm on Saturday and Sunday? That's unheard of for Chinese food restaurants. It's like wtf?? They do compensate for it with generous portions that last 2 days. I don't like the fried rice that they have, especially for the lunch menu, which is a good deal, but it is not really fried rice. I'm not a white rice person, so for dinner, I'll usually go for the chicken fried rice and mix it with the sauce of the entree. It's definitely a different flavored fried rice. Overall, it is good food. Two people can have dinner for under $25. But as far as late night munchies? Forget about coming here. Go toward campus."}
