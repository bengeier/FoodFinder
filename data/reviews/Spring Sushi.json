{"text":"I'm a big fan of ayce sushi was excited to go here. Service was great, water was always full. I did find it annoying that the server did have to confirm our order before it got sent in, I've been to others places with iPad ordering, they never had to do that. but the food still came fast. The sushi was warm and not evenly cut & the las vegas roll tasted like it was canned salmon. we got dishes we didn't order & I was disappointed with there menu ( not alot of options ). there décor was nice. didn't like there table layout. had to share a table with other people, couldn't get a single table even tho there was multiple empty ones and a wait for a booth was 20 mins or more. I probably won't come back to this ayce, there better."}
{"text":"Ok.  All you can't eat sushi. Well... It's as bad as you think it would be. The fish selection is limited, no yellowtail, no octopus. And when you do get a piece of fish it's sliced very thin. But my favorite part of the evening was when I asked if my hand roll could contain less rice than normal, I was told... \"That's not how the machine makes it\".  Somehow every bite I tried became the new worst thing I ever tasted.   The coconut shrimp just made me sad. I tried to find the shrimp. The octopus balls had 2 pieces of octopus that were the size of half a pea.  To end on a positive note - the sesame balls were good, and the tiramisu was akin to tiramisu, yet good."}
{"text":"3.5/5!  I was hesitant to try this location due to all the negative reviews I saw but it really wasn't as bad as I had expected it to be.   I think something I've always hated about sushi places is how emotionless employees are, in the sense that they might as well be robots. They're efficient and quick but show zero emotion. We were asked to wait for our table cause we wanted one by the window as it overlooked Dundas Square but we were seated maybe 2 minutes later. You get to order via an iPad and once you're done, your server comes to your table and confirms the order.   Our miso soups came quite quick and everything followed suit accordingly. I'm not a fan of food invasions so I really liked that plates were brought out a few minutes apart. We only had to wait a while for some plates but definitely not the majority.   So, in terms of the quality. I thought the soups and sashimi were better than most, but their sushi was pretty mediocre, nothing special. Their teriyaki was good and deep fried items were good as well. We tried takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and beef tataki (lightly seared thinly sliced beef) and they were delicious. I ordered a seafood udon soup and it was very well done but I wasn't a fan of the calamari or crab meat. I know it's evident that these types of foods are prepared earlier but they looked almost plastic so that was unappealing. A very loud fire alarm was going off a long time and we weren't getting any straight answers from any of the servers (some said they didn't know, some said it was just a test but the announcement said the alarm had been pulled and is undergoing investigation) so that was a bit annoying.    All U Can Eat dinner on weekends after tax is $30. Not too bad, I would recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 4 / 5 Cooking speed: 4 / 5 Food Quality: 3 / 5 Food Quantity: 4 / 5 Price: 3 / 5 (It is more expensive than other AYCE) Cleanness: 4.5 / 5  Repeat: Yes for M-F Lunch only  I had tried Japanese Buffet all over the city, I have to say I like the idea of ordering on an ipad. I don't have to worry the waitress pretending to take my order and end up less than half of the food. And I can track the number of items I am waiting for. But Spring Sushi's ipad ordering implementation had a major flaw - the waitress had to come to the table and and approve the order before it can be finalized! If the waitress is slow, you will have to wait much long for your food.  But at least we get 95%+ of our ordered food. Some AYCE Japanese restaurant skips 30% of my order.  I would advise to arrive before noon (on M-F) and place most of the food on the 1st order, otherwise when it's full, you may have to wait a while.  Once the order is placed, the food arrives quickly, and the quality is decent. The selection is big enough and we were able to accommodate a colleague who is vegetarian and have nuts and seafood allergies."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and despite the 45 minute wait, we weren't disappointed. The Las Vegas roll and the bbq eel hand roll were probably my favorite. The only downside was we found the place a little difficult to find other than that, decent ayce."}
{"text":"Yikes, it's expensive and the food is shit. The sushi is not fresh and it's overstuffed with rice. Please don't waste your tastebuds trying this garbage."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto with the most variety and I'm a great sushi fan. They've got everything from the simple sushi, nigiris and makis to the extremely creative and well presented rolls.   Among the standard fare one finds at sushi restaurants I found it missing gyozas (they only have vegetarian ones), and red bean ice cream. But they certainly make up for that with many other options. They also have several hot meals and thai food for people in your party that may not be sushi fans.  Refrain from ordering any kind of cocktail though, they are seriously the worst. With just a faint hint of any alcohol and lacking in any taste the drink claims to be. Worse yet those things cost 7$ a pop. Also don't expect any interaction with your servers other than bringing all your orders to the table.  I usually end up going on weekends which is 25$ per person which is not bad given its variety, presentation and location. All in all, a happy customer."}
{"text":"Think of eating AYCE chinese, thai, japanese, korean food in a club. That's this place. Order is done on an iPad, then the server will come and approve, wait a little, then food is served. Very busy from Friday night to the weekend, the queue can get to the stairs. Love the interior and ambience, but it can be very noisy when it's packed up, and expect lots of groups during the weekends (and their happy birthday songs LOL). They only accept Cash and CC, no debits."}
{"text":"Went here last week with a friend last Friday night for dinner. It was surprisingly half full only while the surrounding resturants  were packed with people waiting in line.  My friend and I were debating about choosing to eat buffet at $25 or à la carte. We opted for the menu instead and were very glad we did. The food was mediocre and the portions were decent, but not huge.  If you're looking for good sushi, I woud skip this place.  The service was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"Huge sushi restaurant that has a very corporate/McDonald's type of feel to it. The menu is huge and the sushi is actually quite good. AYCE here is great value. You normally have to wait 10-20 minutes to get a table if you visit during peak hours but it's worth it. Like other AYCE you can't get sashimi during lunch times. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrific ordering experience, great views and friendly staff. Location hard to beat. The place still feels very new. Larger variety than a typical AYCE with good meat and Thai dishes in addition to creative sushi staples. We went for a dinner ($25 pp with discounts for students, seniors and kids) and didn't regret."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the AYCE dinner. I like the variety of sushi and food this place offers. I love that everything can be ordered through iPad  - it's less hassle than writing it down or ordering with a server. I noticed they now have torched sushi rolls as well and it was quite good.   There is usually a long wait for this place so be prepared to wait for a good 30 mins for a table. The price is pretty on par with most AYCE dinner places in Downtown $22.99 which I think is pretty reasonable.   My only issue with this place has been the lack of service. I get that it's a busy place but the servers are pretty rude and they don't ever crack a smile. Also, I've found that most of our orders just didn't come through and even when we ordered again, it still didn't come. So, I found that kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Table smells stinky server Forgot my order, ask four times for the tempura sauce because it didn't come with tempura. You can tell food are not fresh,tempura are refried, beef is tough as rubber etc.for this quality of food AYCE is overpriced"}
{"text":"Not easy to find. It's on the 2nd floor (one above the fast food counters Very impersonal. Order on an iPad. Server comes to confirm.  WARNING... It's also all you can eat, which usually means below standard sushi. And it is below standard. The rolls have a funny plastic taste. Sashimi was so small!!! I order 2 orders of sashimi, and they bring me 2 plates. Therefore, it's made in advance.  And to finish it off, THEY DON'T TAKE DEBIT CARDS.  Last time I'll go to that sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Food is good service meh. Dirty seats, chairs, tables. The food court at the eatons center has a similar ambience.  All methods of payment are accepted, except for DEBIT.  They have an atm but service charges are taken."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.  The menu and selection is huge for an all you can eat.  The portions were not skimpy at all--not even for items ordered a la carte.  The people we came with all thought it was good value for the money and we would've paid more if they charged us.  Edited to add:  A group of us went for lunch.  I would recommend going a little early as we did (around 11:45am) as we got better service because the lunch crowd wasn't in yet.  A 1/2 hour later the place was packed and there was a line up out the door to get in.  It was quite busy.  The staff handled themselves well considering how busy it was that day."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place randomly with a friend. One of the worst sushi I've ever had in Toronto. Even for an AYCE standard, the quality of the fish was incredibly disappointing and food was overall bland.  Snapper sashimi tasted spoiled the Friday night we went and had a really unhealthy yellow appearance. I'm sorry, but any sushi place that makes me spit out sashimi due to a foul taste is an instant no for me.   Goodluck trying to get any service as well, couldn't get my water refilled or an extra tissue the whole night.  The mango pudding was great though, so if anything grab that. At least it's not watered down like other AYCE places. Sadly it's only limited to one per person (lol wut).  tl;dr, I will not be coming back nor recommending any friends."}
{"text":"Muito bem localizado adorei a forma de pedir pelo tablet com agente funcionou super bem!  Ó atendimento foi rápido  A comida e vem gostosa e o valor é bem razoável"}
{"text":"Ok...  So my husband described his sushi as, \"Ok. Nothing special. The rice and the salmon were fresh. So, that's something.\" My pad Thai, on the other hand, was inedible. I'm not sure what needs to happen to ruin pad Thai, but they found a way. The chicken was clearly microwaved. Recently. The rice noodles were bright with some sauce. But said sauce contained nothing that one looks for in pad Thai - no heat, no sweet, no salt, no sour. Think orange noodles, overcooked, and without any appeal. That's it. I didn't see egg. There were a smattering of peanuts in the corner of the container. No lime. No bean sprouts. Very disappointing.  I will say the delivery bag was adorbs."}
{"text":"5  stars for the food. Really a great selection and a good price for all you can eat. The service is a little bit cold, though.   The location is great, of course. There is always food being brought to your table. It's good to stay away from the actual sushi, as that stuff tends to fill your stomach quicker."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Toronto, great selection and yummy food, location is perfect and service is great. I always go for lunch and dinner is real expensive but honestly the food is great guys :) they have so much is amazing"}
{"text":"Good AYCE sushi joint. It is slightly over priced compared to the other AYCE. Service is ok, tempuras are soggy. Maki Rolls are average. However, selection is great and ice cream/desserts are good. Would expect more for the price."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like an actual human being then stay as far away from spring sushi as possible. Our meal was okay, but then our experience went from bad to worse when we were accused of trying to walk out on our cheque. We had told our waitress we'd left the money on the table and were putting on our coats at the table when we were surrounded by five waitresses and the manager yelling that we never paid our cheque and that they were going to call security. An employee had our money in his hands while all this was happening as he was clearing the table. After seeing this they did nothing, not even apologize for the accusation and humiliation they caused us. My boyfriend used to do tons of business lunches here, and we used to bring friends. NEVER AGAIN. there are plenty of better places that treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars because the food is actually ok. But the service is always atrocious. Made a reservation and was told we have a 20 min wait. Why bother taking reservations if they can control the flow of people. Plus, when I looked around there were plenty of available tables. This city lacks for decent sushi places, so here we wait..."}
{"text":"I rarely go and post reviews of restaurants here but my experience last night was a disaster at Spring Sushi. I got there around 7 pm last night for a Saturday dinner - it was busy considering that its downtown and the place is new. The first thing I noticed that something was off was that nobody cared to explain how to use the iPad ordering gadget they use on each table when we were seated. I know thatt we live in 21 st century and most of us have smart phones/gadgets - it will be wise to explain even for 30 secs how it works etch but no one did so I just had to learn it with my group and it was fun - no problem. However, here's the worst part of the experience, the food takes forever to come. Each dish comes in average between 20 to 30 minutes. We were like hungry hyenas fighting for food - service was also subpar - waiters are quite few and some have attitude. I remember even a waiter giving an irritating gesture with his hand for me to wait.  In short, I will never come back to this place. It's up to you if you wish to spend your hard earned money on this place but my two cents is to stay away from this place. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! And probably have been eating here six times this month. The food is great. The portion is perfect, A La Carte or All You Can Eat. Pricing suits it as well. I liked the fact you have an iPad to make your order on and can see what each food item looks like before ordering. The service was always fast, efficient & extremely friendly.  Suggestions: Spicy Salmon Roll & the Seafood Fried Rice  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This happened yesterday, Thursday October 22nd 2015. My sister made a reservation for 8pm. My aunts and my cousin arrived at 7:55pm. The hostess, a petite young woman in a black pencil skirt and a lacy cropped tank top told them, \"We're just waiting for a table to clear.\" There was a table nearby and no one was sitting there. It just hasn't been cleared or wiped yet. A few moments later, I arrive. My aunts tell me to ask the hostess what's going on. I approach her and she tells me, \"We're just waiting for someone to clear the table.\" Two men arrive at the table and clear it. My sister arrives and we all sit in the waiting area, waiting to be seated. At this point, the table still hasn't been wiped and we haven't been seated. I look at my watch and its 8:14pm. What's the point of having a reservation if it's not going to be honored at its scheduled time? We approach the hostess and tell her we're leaving because we have been kept waiting too long. The hostess stares blankly and looks at the desk. She doesn't apologize. We're all pretty unimpressed by her behavior and leave.  I have worked in the food service industry for 14 years. Perhaps the hostess was having a bad day, is new or maybe she just didn't care. She's human, she's allowed to have weaknesses but then I beg the question, is that the kind of employee you want representing your restaurant? Your restaurant lost a bill for 5 people yesterday and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. Maybe that will inspire your employee to be a bit more empathetic and helpful to the next customers she serves. I hope no one else receives the lack of service we did last night."}
{"text":"You get an iPad to order your food. It's so easy and the food comes quick. I love their selection and each item has a picture so you can see what you are in for. I've taken plenty of people here and they all loved it!"}
{"text":"We came here for a large birthday dinner. The service in the beginning was a bit weird - they wouldn't let us sit down even though they had our reserved table ready, and the waiter was trying to tell us where to sit based on who was having AYCE. But the food was very good and fresh and it arrived promptly when ordered, so on the whole we enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"The iPad was fun and modern to order on. The sushi itself was not very good. The best thing I ordered was the curry chicken. The white tuna was also good. The salmon and rolls were not very good at all. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since it first opened, sadly, food and customer services have both deteriorated to a point that I will not come back personally.  I like how the menu updates with new things, but the core menu (traditional sushi and sashimi) is definitely not as good as it used to be, I remember back then, the salmon on the salmon sushi is long and well-cut, rice is small and warm, comparable to a nice Japanese sushi house. Now, food is just average (taro chips still very good though).  Customer service is very poor, the staffs all appeared to have Bieber attitude. On average 10% of what you ordered would go wrong, either missing or you got someone else's food.   Over-priced food must be justified by either 1) food, 2) service, 3) atmosphere, in this case 1) average, 2) bad, 3) it's gets boring after going once or twice."}
{"text":"So today I ate at the buffet restaurant. It has a nice patio view, however there are limited seats and we didn't get placed there since it was so busy. The food was mediocre, it was okay. The taro bubble tea I bought was watery and disgusting. It was probably rushed. Took forever to get my drink, and sometimes I wouldn't get the right order. The pricing was good and affordable, It was 20 dollars for sushi and a drink. Some of the employees looked upset and didn't look like they wanted to be there. The atmosphere just felt awkward and I didn't feel wanted. The main server that I got was nice so I left them a tip.  Wouldn't go there again.. Rather travel far for good and fast service than go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Sushi was great . Charge extra if you waste food. iPads were a great way to order! Seems pretty clean and classy too"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants in the city! The sushi is fresh and comes to the table within minutes of ordering. For the amount of people that can dine in this restaurant, the food and service is pretty quick.   The one thing that keeps me from frequenting more is that it does cost about 10 dollars more for the dinner/lunch than most AYCE sushi restaurants. The view from the windows over y&d square is also a sight to see, making the dining experience that much more enjoyable if you do get to sit there."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. Pro-tip: no matter what, make a reservation for lunch or dinner. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Well well the place is typical. Nothing special. Don't worth gong for.  I like the ordering system. I didn't need to talk with the waiter directly and the pics made things straightforward. But the thing was it was hard for us to figure out what had been served and what had not. The service is slow. We had to ask several times for certain dishes. The menu is quite limited, especially for the dessert. The food is ok overall. I love crispy avocado tofu sushi and tofu sushi. The eel rice was really really disappointing."}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food was great! I went on a Saturday night and it was very busy. It took us about 30 minutes to get seated but it was understandable. While my guest and I were waiting we were entertained by the ipads available to customers waiting to get seated. The service was great considering how many people there were. First off, the servers were very friendly and frequently came to ask how we were doing and when we ordered something on the iPad a server came in under a minute. It took a little longer than usual to get our food but again, considering how many people there were my guest and I were pretty impressed by how fast everything was going. The food was delicious and I absolutely love how they have many things to chose from. My favorite was the salmon rose, I don't know if it's because of the taste or because of how cute it looked. The way the food was displayed when it got to out table was very eye pleasing. The reason why I'm giving this place a 4 is because of the sashimi. I found that it was too thin but this is something minor.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood yeh am a fannnnnnnnnn"}
{"text":"This is just another average AYCE joint with one exception: you order though an iPad. They have all the regular rolls and appetizers that you would find at other sushi restaurants with the exception of a few things... such as the bean curd sushi and other specialty rolls. They also have tiramisu although I didn't try it.  I'm not a big fan of tempura but their shrimp tempura surprised me. I was strangely tasty with just the right amount of batter on it, so give it a try!  Come with a big group and be prepared to eat!"}
{"text":"Asian friends say \"This is crap! Not Asian food at all !!\"  Went with them last night, sushi were WARM. Other food item taste awful.   Totally NOT authentic, just a rip off !"}
{"text":"Spring Sushi never disappoints with their AYCE. It's one of the best AYCE in Toronto! I really like their taro chips, their rolls are better quality than most AYCE. Also, they are very quick with the orders, and provide great service."}
{"text":"Man so many bads with this place. Their rice was old when we had their sushi. The fried sushi roll wasn't even sushi anymore. The rice was gelatinized into a dense block of who knows what meaning they reuse food from days ago. Their pad thai and fried rice was soggy. Everything is bland.   The servers are pissed off and threw our food onto the table. One of them had plating issues where she just put everything at the edge of the table even though the middle of the table was empty. They're bored and angry!  It was 5pm on a Saturday and the restuarant only had 4 tables filled. Over priced. It's mainly a convenient location for tourists to try out. Don't go."}
{"text":"I went to Spring Sushi on a Friday night and was mildly impress by it. The only selling point I see was the fact that you could order on an iPad and get descriptions on items that you weren't familiar with. To me, this is a great concept if you were to come with a big group.  The food itself was alright. Nothing to really complaint or comment about if you have been to enough AYCE places. I did enjoy the crispy bean curd avocado roll. The sashimi was good but the portion itself was a little small compare to other places I've been to. I tried the BBQ Beef Rib which was small and majority of it was fat (not what I anticipated) and the teppanyaki sirloin steak with garlic was disappointing.  One of my favourite things to get is spider rolls when I go for sushi and the one from Spring Sushi was way too salty!!! I was quite disappointed.  Overall, the place was alright. The food itself was typical and nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The food here isn't too bad, but it also isn't excellent. When I ate here I had by far some of the WORST service I've ever had. To start off, I am really against the idea of ordering off iPads. Especially when we had a larger group who had to pass around one iPad to order. It took forever to place our orders because of the size of the group (over 30 minutes). I see the iPads being good for one or two people, or if everyone in your party was going to order all-you-can-eat. But it all became very confusing, very quickly. Our food was coming at the most random times and they ended up giving me the wrong food. It was all very confusing. To top off all the frustration and confusion, our waiter spilt hot soup on someone at our table. I get it, mistakes happen...but with everything that was happening we were not impressed. When it came time to get our bills it took ages to sort everything out. We were already running behind from the slow service and we didn't have time to wait another 20 minutes for them to sort the bills out. We were finally able to pay and get out of there. I was not happy with the price I had to pay for the mediocre food I had eaten. I will NEVER be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a number of times and thoroughly enjoyed it. I made a reservation for a luncheon meeting and was informed less then an hour beforehand that my reservation had been cancelled. I was already in route. This created a real problem of waiting for my guests. One of my guests went into the Spring Sushi anyway and was informed that it was a private party. Highly irresponsible behaviour. I was also informed via email that my reservations had been cancelled 12 hours after the fact!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here in Yelp, I have given this place a try  and I would say I am frustrated with the level of service I got. I was completely dismissed by a waiter when I asked for water and I had to wait between 35 minutes for each order to come. I don't normally post reviews here but it was so terrible that it would be a disservice not to inform the community. Also I had to pay $65.00 for two people for a lousy dinner pfft."}
{"text":"Meh.  It isn't the best AYCE sushi place that I've been to.  It isn't even second of third best.  It not terrible, but it doesn't have a lot of flavour.  My mom and I were downtown to see a show so we decided to come here because of the tablet ordering idea, which is cool.  It was empty when we got there and the seater asked us to sit to the side for a minute, which is fine.  Then two more couples came in and they were seated right away.  When she came back from seating the second couple she noticed us and realized that she hadn't attended to us yet, which was annoying.  We ordered a pineapple fried rice that was so oily and completely flavourless.  The best thing that we had was the coconut shrimp and the purple rice pudding.  The sushi and the other dishes were basic and quite plain.  I've had so many AYCE places that take the time to make their food taste wonderful and not just push it out as fast as possible, so that is not an excuse.  The view is gorgeous, and the place is great, but they need to work on the taste."}
{"text":"I had the AYCE menu here. The sushi quality is typical of an AYCE sushi place which means edible but not great, and the cooked food from the \"thai\" sections were all super salty! I guess they are adding salt to compensate for the bland food? Tempura was batter heavy and greasy."}
{"text":"Sushi Sundays are kind of a big deal! I really like this place, try and get seating by the window - it has a great view. Service is fast and friendly, and the food is amazing. It is forever busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst sushi experiences I've had. The fish was not fresh and the food tasted very bad. Most of the dishes were not seasoned and the sushi was mushy. The rolls were also disgusting, tasted like paste. Definitely not worth the price for lunch."}
{"text":"Good Evening: I trust that all reading my post are well. Thank you for reading. I feel compelled to write that Spring Sushi is low quality sushi for the masses. I had great expectations that the restaurant would be a pleasant and  an excellent quality Sushi restaurant.  It was not. The room, although decorated well, did not help to negate the low quality offerings from the establishment. I am aware that the price point is not very expensive, but the establishment should provide a few descent offerings, they did not. I have enjoyed Sushi from corner stores  that have been more palatable. I am not going to dwell on specific items, it all was very poor. Govern Yourself Accordingly and Happy New Year."}
{"text":"Amazing quality for AYCE menu, lots to choose from and the pace is set well (2-3 plates served each time). There's a 20 item order limit (order more as you eat or split into 2 orders) and 1 slice of each sashimi per order only. Still beats most other AYCE places in terms of quality and selection and I was definitely able to \"eat back\" my money's worth for the slightly pricier bill."}
{"text":"the main selling point is the fact that they have ipad to order on! other than that, it's all pretty standard, they had a good amount of food but i do wish they had more dessert options, like those at tenichi. but the desserts here are just ice cream. howeverrr, the sushi rolls are creative and the sashimi is fresh so that's the main point. and also, if you get seats by the window, you can look out across dundas square which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant when I haven't had sushi in a while. It's fast, it's easy, and there's good variety. The servers don't hover but are always there when you need more drinks or to have the table bused. The location is fantastic since my husband and I usually head to the theater on the same floor for date night.   The iPads make ordering really easy and not embarrassing when going hard on the sushi, but occasionally orders get missed or delayed. The last time I went, we thought my husband's order of sashimi had been missed so we ordered another round. We ended up being served with both the original order and the new order in the next 5 or so minutes. Luckily when we left some uneaten sushi on our plates we weren't charged additionally for \"wasted\" food."}
{"text":"For AYCE sushi, this is the best place I can think of.   Their white tuna quality is very comparable or even better than many A La Cart places. Salmon sashimi is as good as any other place that I've been to. I think as long as there is a good amount of client flow, how can the sashimi taste bad? That's why white tuna is a good indicator that this place has a huge client flow, because it does not taste like it's been sitting in water defrosted like most other AYCE places.  If you ever ordered their alcohol drinks, you'd be shocked at how good it is. Love the lime gin and tonic with the slightest hint of cucumber in it. If you prefer sweeter drinks, Lychee is a good choice.  I like the Banana Avocado Shrimp roll, very intricate flavouring. Many places make sushi and smack a ton of mayonaise on it. This is not that kind of place. There is definitely thoughts in making this new combination. Make sure you get the sauce with it. Sometimes the chef forgets and it makes a big difference in taste.  I like to bring my friends here because everyone gets what they want. Even if they don't eat raw fish or fish for that matter, there is a ton of cooked selections that would please the crowd.  The sheer amount of people that goes through this place really keeps the sashimi taste fresh.  Did I mention, extremely SPEEDY service? I have no patience. Every time I've been here, after we order, food arrives under 5min. That's a 5 star in my book any day."}
{"text":"Basically my favourite sushi restaurant. I'm super picky with sushi and the stuff here tastes really fresh!"}
{"text":"Management and host/seating staff TERRIBLE.  Ambiance like a cheap cafeteria with low budget decor.  Waiters running around like headless chickens.  No organization.  Low quality food!"}
{"text":"We were the first to be seated as soon as the restaurant opened.  We placed our order on the Ipads and the waiter came over to take our drink orders.   The restaurant filled up quickly and other tables were getting their food.  After 20 minutes and no food for us we called the waiter over.  He said that he thought we wanted to wait for our drinks before our food, yet after 20 minutes, no drinks.  The food finally came.  We asked for water all around and after 10 minutes saw our waiter with a water jug re-filling other tables water.  Only after he finished that did he bring us our first round of water.   Terrible Service."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner reservation and requested a window because we were celebrating 2 birthdays.  Alas, I was starving so no pictures.  Edamame and seaweed salad to start.  Took us a while to figure out how to order but once we got going it was great.    Everything salmon was fresh, the white tuna was interesting as I've never heard of it. A quick google search and I won't order it again.  The sushi was all good.  My friend ordered the fried rice, shrimp stir fry and pad Thai.  All were poor.   Our last orders, just to try things at that point, Korean ribs and Taro chips.  Taro chips were excellent and the ribs were okay.  Best dishes for me were the torched sushi, salmon rose, unagi nigiri, seaweed salad and Taro chips.  All the rolls looked excellent too.  We had the rainbow roll, so good.  If I were to eat as much at my regular sushi haunts, I'd be paying twice as much so I'm okay with an occasional lesser quality meal if only for the novelty."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Spring Sushi today to check out their rooftop patio and am I ever happy we did. What a wonderful patio! We had such a great time. Originally we had planned to go to the Jack Astors patio but the wait was over an hour so we thought we would try Spring Sushi. The service was great, sushi was very fresh and delicious and the atmosphere was amazing. Really impressed with the iPad menus they have, made it really easy to order and you can keep track of how much your tab is. There is no AYCE on the patio, but the prices are great, we didn't need to do the AYCE option. Definitely hitting up this hot spot again and telling everyone about it."}
{"text":"Was totally went downhill in a few short months.  Waiters are extremely busy and have terrible service. One guy spilt hot water all over my side and didnt even do anything."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is STELLAR! Everything is fresh, and so delicious! The service is quick, even when the place is packed. I'm actually not a sushi fan AT ALL. I don't order it here. There are enough \"other items\" on the menu, spring rolls, pad thai, dumplings, cooked food, that I forget I'm even in a sushi restaurant.   My favourite item to order is the chicken \"sushi\" roll. It's rolled in seaweed and filled with rice and cucumber, but the chicken is cooked. It is topped with a teriyaki sauce that it so good! It's what keeps me coming back to this place.   It can be pretty noisy when it's busy, but it's a great atmosphere. It's a little on the expensive side, but for the quality of food, and also the fact that it's a buffet, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"No better than any other AYCE sushi along Yonge St, which is to say not great. If AYCE is what you're looking for, save a few dollars and find another in the area or better yet, avoid AYCE altogether and visit an à la carte sushi establishment where quality beats quantity. For the price you're paying, a clean bathroom and finished dining area (the wallpaper covered half the dining area with the other half featuring walls that formerly had wallpaper, which was clearly peeling in the middle of the room's ceiling) would've been nice. Not worth the price or the wait."}
{"text":"I don't even like sushi, or buffets per se. Spring Sushi however, is truly an experience. More than a novelty, ordering on tablets throughout your meal serves both the diner and staff efficiency. As someone who doesn't care much for seafood, I loved the steak wrapped green onion, chicken fried rice and appetizer options - I was kept well fed with a panorama of flavourful east asian dishes. Fair warning, most items are more on the greasy side so expect to throw health caution out the door when you walk in."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for AYCE lunch. My table took a while to be set up because they had to clean it, but when I got to the table, there were still rice and food on the seats/table... which was a pretty unappetizing start to be honest. I felt the fish was not fresh and had the \"fishy\" taste. The nigiri had too much rice that was warm and too loosely packed that it constantly broke apart. The fish was pretty thin too. The LA rolls were the worst (for me).  I enjoyed the sweet potato tempura and the rainbow rolls... and the ice cream. But I wouldn't go ever again because there are cheaper and better AYCE sushi places. It's not worth the price."}
{"text":"The food have the Worst quality. Fish is not fresh at all. The fish and the rice are even not combined together. And the rice is so warm. Slow service. Not worth the money. They don't serve as many kinds of food as other sushi all you can eat. We ordered 5 kinds of sushi, they only gave us 2 of them, and let us reordered after  30 mins. What they have are the good location and iPads. As I see they waste them."}
{"text":"Went there to satisfy a craving for Sushi while at the Eaton Centre. The method of ordering from a tablet was new and helped our service which was polite and very fast. The food was excellent and had a wide selection. All in all I greatly enjoyed my meal and would love to go again."}
{"text":"We were told the wait was 20mins. We waited 1hr20mins before being seated. Groups were seated ahead of us despite asking three times to be seated.   We only had a party of THREE so it's not as if it was rocket science.  I walked around a number of times and saw lots of free tables.  Once seated it was overpriced and underwhelming food. All in all you can have a far better sushi experience in  Toronto for much less hassle and cost.  SIMPLY TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars for this place.  Came here a few times for the AYCE dinner, and while I don't have any complaints about the service (pretty standard for AYCE), I don't have any compliments about it either.  We are usually seated pretty quickly (within 5 minutes) and get to ordering right away on our ipad.  My favourite part about this restaurant is the ipad ordering system as it just makes everything faster + easier than having to fill a sheet of paper and/or flagging down the server to take our order manually each time.  Once your order is submitted on the ipad, it takes about 5-15 minutes for your orders to arrive, depending on the order.  They bring things in close intervals, so you won't be bombarded with food but won't find yourself waiting for half an hour before the next wave of what you originally ordered arrives.  The sashimi is fine, not the freshest or best I've had but definitely not the worst. The rolls are typical as well, nothing stands out in particular so you are safe with ordering the usual rolls you like at AYCEs.  The mushrooms stir fried in butter tastes great due to the copious amount of butter used but why not indulge while there?  I do love ordering the lotus chips, they are a nice side snack to chew on while sipping on your miso soup and waiting for your orders to arrive.    Price for AYCE comes up to about $30/person if you are going for dinner on a weekend, so it's a little more pricier than uptown AYCE but you are paying for the trendy Yonge/Dundas location along with the food.  I do recommend you try it out if you are in downtown Toronto around Eaton Centre and want to try a 'fun' place for AYCE since the ipad ordering system will be a novelty. While there are other delicious sushi places around, this restaurant is physically larger than many of the small sushi spots, so you won't have a difficult time getting seated if you are with a group."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Spring Sushi Cuisine: Japanese/AYCE Location: Downtown Address: 10 Dundas St E Price Range: $15~25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 3  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Located inside Dundas Square Building * Open for lunch, dinner and late night  What do you do when you are bored? I play on my iphone....check twitter, email, facebook....all that and I check out new and hot restaurants opening up. I stumbled upon a review for Spring Sushi and realized it was a newly opened AYCE sushi place that replaced where Woo used to be in the Dundas Square building.  Well, that's an awesome place for a new AYCE restaurant- I thought to myself. Yes, there are couple around downtown but not too many that's so popular that I can name on top of my head...and Dundas Square!? that's like Times Square of Toronto, right? (uhhhhh NOPE)  Anyways, so I decided to check it out one day for lunch-  Spring Sushi is just like any other AYCE joints but one cool thing that's different is that they have iPad menu! You scroll through everything they have (photo of dishes shown) and order on it instead of having someone stand there for 5 minutes writing down your order for 30 pieces of rolls and teriyaki this and that. So once you put the orders through, all the servers carry a iPhone which gets push notification for the order which they then put the orders through at the kitchen.  How awesome is that? one thing I did notice is that the iPad menu stand takes a little too much room on the table and I was scared I would knock it over (although it is covered with a case).  Also, the old fashioned person I am- couldn't trust the system so I flagged down the server twice to see if my order went through. Well, good thing I was being anal because the second time I checked- it didn't go through! You can't entirely depend on technology you see (as I type away on my computer and listen to songs on my iphone)  Anyways, here are few of the things I specifically liked from everything I tried from Spring Sushi.  Salmon Tataki Salad, Spicy salmon roll, Tempura spicy salmon hand roll and eel fried rice. I would just avoid ordering stir fried noodle dish and chicken skewer with curry sauce.  Summary: Overall it was alright for AYCE sushi considering the price and the location. Of course it's not the best quality because if you want that, you wouldn't go to AYCE. But if you want a decent AYCE spot that doesn't charge you too much and prefer to stay in Downtown of Toronto- I would recommend Spring Sushi. Still, my favorite AYCE spot is 168 sushi (Check out my review here) but Spring Sushi will do if I don't want to drive. If you decide to drop by....I hope you know how to use iPad :D"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend. Very nice space, love ordering off iPad. The food is good, the fish was fresh. Service was quick and the restaurant was busy, as well the servers were very friendly.   Some items we ordered were not amazing, but that was more of a personal taste matter. Everything was hot and fresh.   A little expensive but tons and tons of options so it's worth it. Definitely worth a visit, and for sure a fun place to come with a group of friends."}
{"text":"meh...I mean the price is right but the quality reflects the price...it is what it is, meh"}
{"text":"We went to spring sushi for launch and it was an okay experience. I have been to similar restaurants before where they give you an iPad to order and stuff which is probably the cool part about the restaurant. We decided to go for an all you can eat kind of menu and unfortunately I was disappointed. The menu had very few options compared to many other similar restaurants and the service was eh. I remember we ordered the mango ice cream and waited for almost 15 mins even tho it came out to different tables. We weren't able to choose one of the tables close to the bar because of the fact that they didn't allow anyone to sit there during launch and all the tables near by the windows were taken which forced us to sit in the middle. It was okay because of the comfy seats. When it comes to all you can eat restaurants people usually want to sit, eat and talk, but I noticed that the servers were kind of forcing the tables to finish quickly and leave kinda of early which happened with us too. Also the restaurant is way too expensive for the quality represented and the food options compared to Mandarin, or Wind restaurants.   Would I recommend it? For a one time kind of thing sure, if you can get a table beside the window do it cause the view is worth it."}
{"text":"Honestly I only came here because my girl works at this restaurant but surprisingly I would've expected more from a place like this. It's placed right in the middle of downtown and yet I feel like it's such a rip off for the price you pay. To eat here on a weekday is around $60 for 2 people and they don't even have a lot of good sushi rolls.. Only one that's good is the Las Vegas roll. The takoyaki is okay and the sashimi was average. Their dessert menu is very limited as well... Mango, green tea and I think there was one more flavor. From a place that makes so much money seriously? I'm disappointed because it makes the restaurant look cheap."}
{"text":"This is less than mediocre sushi place. I guess it's good for a quick fix but there's nothing exceptional. Variety of selections. Although, I ordered a sirloin steak dish and it was so red that I was scared to get  sick from it so I didn't eat it. A sushi roll with salmon on top was a browner color, showing it wasn't fresh... and I went for lunch. Service is pretty good, especially for a sushi place. Overall, I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"++WHY? I went here for my birthday a couple of weeks ago with my friends. We randomly decided to go here not planning where to go. Everyone wanted sushi, so I said, hey. Why not give it a try?  ++FOOD? The cooked food was good. I liked the tempuras, the grilled meats, and fried things.  The sushi however, especially the maki's were not that great. The filling to rice ratio is just wow. Skimpage on the fillings of the sushi much! I liked the dragon rolls though, and the sashimi. Spring Rolls makes their sushi lie as if you're ordering ala carte, but here... no. The sushi definitely could've been better. Typical All you can eat sushi... Quality is crap, but plenty of food.  ++SERVICE? The whole iPad thing was cute and very interactive. I loved it and thought it was real fun having to order that way. It prevents any confusion and possible verbal communication issues. The servers were somewhat attentive and catered to us fine.   ++ATMOSPHERE? It looks great, modern, sleek. The view of touristy Dundas Square at night looks great.  ++BONUS? It was my birthday that night and I did not know that they give free birthday cakes to tables celebrating birthdays, AHHHH they did a great job surprising me with that MANGO MOOSE cake, it definitely was one of those fun moments that I wish were caught on tape. The memories were definitely what made this place good. The food? Not so much. I didn't have to pay for my bill since it was my birthday, which made it even better.  I would've given this restaurant and my dining experience here 2 STARS**, but I'll give the place 3 STARS*** instead. The iPad, the Birthday cake, and the memories that I will remember forever definitely earned them that extra star.  xoxoxoxo  ps. if you want a free cake on your birthday, come here with four or more of your friends. It's about $25 per person, but if you're looking for a slightly better quality and do not care so much about the free cake, go to Springrolls instead. It's much better IMHO."}
{"text":"Interiors are okay, and the concept is great. However, the some of the food was really bad and I meant smelt bad. Some of the sushi tasted okay, but I ended up getting food poisoning and called Toronto health. I paid $30 for a buffet and spent the next 24 hours of my life being sick in the bathroom? I expected high standards and quality of food from this place. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came here several times and always had really good food and service. Yes, you do have to wait 30 min to be seated. They are packed because their food is amazing. Their wine, cocktails and bubble tea was excellent. The food is always fresh and cooked perfectly. I always get a seat facing the Yonge and Dundas square while I enjoy my dinner.   It is overpriced for ayce because of the location but it's definitely worth it. It's approximately $35-$40 per person with tax."}
{"text":"1. This one is in Yonge Dundas, the busiest corner of whole Canada 2. Above it is cineplex Toronto downtown.  3. Price acceptable. An all-you-can eat style similar to BC sushi in Vancouver"}
{"text":"**3.5**  This place is packed on the weekend but don't worry, their service is fast and you'll get a table soon enough. I like the whole iPad menu concept (I like to see pictures of what I'm going to eat) and I tried the crystal bento box. Mr. H has two rolls, crunchy salmon and tuna. The bento box was ok, I was not a big fan of the tempura or the teriyaki (basically I've had better and I prefer the bento box at Spring Rolls). The quantity however was a lot! The sushi rolls were better than my bento box, so I'll probably go again to try that.   Will try the AYCE once for sure..."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCA sushi place downtown. One of the few places I have found that you can get a couple options of red tuna. They add allot more rice to a normal roll."}
{"text":"tbh, the food here were very delicious! but the service is so bad! that's a big problem.. show your respect!! n plz be patient with your customers!"}
{"text":"Love ordering from the iPad. Made it so much easier a tnd enjoyable to order the food, since every selection had a photo with it.   The food was great. the mango pudding is a must if you're going there. The ambience of the place is also very nice.  Although it took forever to be seated, the service was great. It can't be helped to wait for seating when it's a busy night, but we always got our food fairly quickly, and a nice server too.   The only thing is you have to pay cash or credit, no debit. It'd be nice to have the debit option but it's not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"Good services and fun to order with iPad but the food are so bad. The worst thing in the menu are chicken skewer, takoyaki ,and grilled salmon, it tasted so bad compared to other all u can eat places. Final conclusion never going back again."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time yesterday. The service is great. The food is fresh and delicious and the price is very reasonable. I went with my fiancé and we decided not to go with the all you can eat. We ordered everything we wanted and the bill came up to $30 (better than the $26 per person for all-u -can eat).  I would consider this option, if you're not the biggest eater."}
{"text":"I went to Spring Sushi today for lunch and greatly enjoyed my meal. The sushi was fresh and tasty. The kitchen items were excellent. The kitchen in Spring Sushi uses excellent sauces. The servers were very good and quite helpful. I also noticed that the restaurant was decorated for Halloween. That was a nice touch.   Spring Sushi is in a large well designed space on the 5th floor of a building. The outdoor balcony seats were closed for the season. It overlooks Yonge-Dundas Square. It was busy for lunch and is deservedly popular.  When, Spring Sushi first opened, I went there a couple of times and quite enjoyed the food. I had not been back, because I had no reason to be in downtown Toronto. I am quite glad that I returned today. It is one of the best AYCE restaurants in the GTA. I also want to point out that Spring Sushi was one of the first restaurants to use an Ipad menu. Ipad menus are now becoming common, but Spring Sushi was a leader and many of the others copied Spring Sushi."}
{"text":"April 2014 Dinner. $24.99 (weekday). Overall food quality 6/10, good presentation 7/10, restaurant environment and cleanliness 8/10, variety 6/10.   Overall not amazed by anything in particular from this restaurant. Not a big selection on food and could tastes better. View is good if you sit by the window.  Garlic shrimp was okay but not enough garlic. Steak, garlic mushroom barely flavourful and soaked in sauce. Sashimi wasn't that awesome.  Arctic roll was hard, probably sat in fridge. Taro chips were fresh and good Lad vegas roll is really just Philadelphia roll. Deep fried shrimp tastes like dim sum ones. Black dragon roll comes in 8 pieces, beware. Beef tataki is a bit over cooked for tataki.  Not impressed, wouldn't purposely come and definitely wouldn't pay weekend price for this. But they've got full bar with beer, wine, sake and cocktails (check weekly specials gor $4.99 cocktails)"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the \"meh\" reviews are about but I loved Spring Sushi! Their portions were good, not over-stuffed like some places, their presentation always consistent and on point every time. Their sashimi collection, although not very varied, tasted fresh and amazing!  The fried/grilled shrimp anything was off-the-hook. The yam tempura was tasty and amazing. Overall we had a fantastic dinner and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As far as AYCE sushi restaurants go, this one just doesn't compare to all the other ones I have tried. We were a group of 5 and were given two iPads for ordering which was more convenient than having one between all of us. The sushi rolls were nothing special and didn't have us wanting more. I would have liked the Las Vegas roll if it wasn't deep fried because I find the texture of these types of rolls is unappealing. The coconut shrimp, however was good. I don't eat sashimi so I can't comment on that. After our meal we went outside to enjoy some drinks on the patio. At least it has a great location and view, but food wise, needs some work. I won't be going back unless someone makes me and if I do I would probably order a la carte because there weren't enough good food items to justify the AYCE price."}
{"text":"My favourite all you can eat sushi place downtown Toronto. I've been to dozens of spots before finding this one and I absolutely love it. I come every Sunday around noon. I never wait for longer than 5 minutes. You order off and iPad and the food comes out almost instantly."}
{"text":"Good and reasonable for the price ... service need to improve ... noodles are not so good and there is no taste. The crab sushi is excellent. Will back for sure"}
{"text":"Great location for an ayce sushi the menu has a wide variety the price is reasonable the service is good especially for an Asian restaurant is above average"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday and it was really good. Sushi was amazing, and for the AYCE price i think it's a good deal on sushi. Sevice took a bit but other than that it was a nice place, and I even got seated pretty much instantly."}
{"text":"The all u can eat foods taste so bad! I ordered sushi and rolls has took one hour to serve to us when we already feel full and going to pay. Don't recommend to try it, although it has sex and pretty waitress, it nothing when the food not good enough."}
{"text":"wow this place is the epitome of garbage sushi! i can't believe i gave this \"sushi thai\" ayce a chance because this toronto IG blogger posted some \"nice pictures\" and said it was \"good\" let me tell you this... i unfollowed her on an instant!  Their mission of \"fresh\" sushi... BS!  NO ONE goes to a sushi thai place... it's not fusion... it just means it's disgusting!  Here's my word of advice... go anywhere else but here! I'm not even sure how this place even averages 3 yelp stars!"}
{"text":"After a major disappointment at the go to AYCE in downtown I swore off going to an AYCE places at least  in downtown core.  Ah well one has to give in to peer pressure once in a while. My buddy and I decided to try this place out after catching a movie. The place is right opposite the movie theater so that made it easy. The location is prime IMO and is right on the main hub of activity.  The setup is high tech if that makes sense to you (read a lot of neon and modern interior) We were seated promptly and got the most ridiculously over sized table that could seat 6 easy for the 2 of us. Oh goodie more places to put the dishes I guess. Ordering is high tech going with the theme here as one gets an iPad with a custom app and one gets to order from it (though a server needs to validate the order for submission)  High marks for putting tech to good use. Now for the main attraction IMO the food there is your regular AYCE Japanese items and they even have Thai food that's not so Thai IMO (more on that later) We ordered a medley of AYCE favs like some Tempura, Sushi Rolls, Salad, Teriyaki, Teppanyaki, Sushi and Sashimi in the first round. The food started to arrive promptly nothing really stood out as it was just the filler stuff. Some of the meat items were actually sub par.  We ordered some Thai items such as Satay stuff as well and they were not Thai IMO. Just some hot sauce that had no hint peanut. On to the dessert my ordered his ice cream medley and I went for tiramisu. Ice cream was OK according to my friend tiramisu was just average. For food I would say 2-2.5 stars as it is a place to fill up. Service was very efficient so half star bump for that."}
{"text":"Saw a white hair with oil follicle in my food. Told the waiter and he didn't do anything.   Overpriced mediocre food. Fast service and a host that just keeps fixing her hair instead of being attentive."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else. I had the most unpleasant dining experience at this place. I understand that generally sushi ayce places have below par customer service but this place is by far the worst I've experienced. Our waiter kept dropping by and asking us if we were done (not in a polite way) even though we had only been seated for less than 45 minutes. In the end we got so annoyed we just left without having any deserts. Not to mention that the food was not good either. For the money we spent we could've had much better sushi."}
{"text":"Initially I meant to go to the Jack Astors next door, but after my encounter with terribly rude hostesses, I decided to go to Spring Sushi where I actually got decent customer service. Although the quality of the food here is mediocre, I think the ipad idea is pure genius! I get to have fun choosing what to eat, and unlike other AYCE places, I don't have to memorize all the items I want to order. The ipad also takes away any ambiguity about portions and ingredients, and also made everything more efficient, in that as soon as our order was received by our server, we started getting our food after like 3 minutes. Now food wise, I think that for what you get it is a good deal if you go on weekdays, but I don't think the quality is worth the weekend/holiday pricing. They have a large variety of options, but some are better than others. They also have daily drink specials where you can get a cocktail for around $4.50 if i remember correctly, which I think is a terribly good deal. Overall, I enjoyed my time here a lot, environment is great, no long waits for food, awesome ipad system, will happily return in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been to many AYCE Japanese restaurants. Spring sushi is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying that I, as a whole, go into AYCE sushi restaurants lower standards than other sushi places. I almost strictly prefer to order a la cart, as I find it has the highest chance of having the freshest fish used, properly vinegared rice with a good ratio of rice to filling. My forays into AYCE places are often not of my own volition - going for the sake of good company rather than mind-blowing food!  Me and five friends went in for a Friday reservation, for 1:00 in the afternoon. Stepping in, I thought the restaraunt was pretty big - especially considering it's on the fourth floor of a building. Walking to our table, I realized that there was another section of seats around a wall! I felt sorry for the kitchen staff - AYCE sounds bad enough to keep up with orders, but when you have dozens and dozens of tables to stay on top of, there better be a huge kitchen! getting seated and being handed an iPad with a glossy white cover, I began my foray into one of the better AYCE establishments in Toronto.  Prior to coming in to the restaurant, my only knowledge of it coming in was \"That AYCE Sushi place with the iPads\". The former made me think of subpar food, and the latter made me think of a gimmick that was mostly to make the restaurant stand out. Seeing iPads chained to stands with games like \"Candy Crush Saga\" and \"Flappy Bird\" available to play started to reinforce the latter assumption of mine.  When I was seated and saw the iPad menu in action, I was actually quite impressed with the innovation of sorts that came from the iPad. Pictures of each item, quantities of how much of each item per order and a list of ingredients presented itself. This is very beneficial both to those who are new to the food (knowing the differences of different rolls, etc), and those who are battle hardened sushi eating veterans (knowing whether or not you get 1 per order or 6 per order).   I had the silly misconception that the kitchen had a live feed of what we input onto the iPad. While dilly-dallying for 5 or 10 minutes, a friend of mine informed me that you have to press a button to call a server. Oops?  With the slick and shimmer of the iPad menu away from my hands, I came back to the realization that, Yes, Spring Sushi indeed is an AYCE establishment. With it, comes many things to expect (which indeed came into fruition that very afternoon). Here's my laundry list of AYCE annoyances:  - Missing orders: though they had the iPad to help them, it still didn't save them from falling prey to this classic problem. One HUGE plus that I have to give to the place was that our waitress went out of her way to check up on us, see if we got all of our orders, et cetera. Sure, it still took a bit of time on our sweet potato tempura even after our second round came through, but with a huge space like this, I'd imagine the fryer would be frying non-stop.   - Odd amounts: 6 orders of Shrimp Tempura (which the iPad states give you 2 per order) should not lead us to getting 8 pieces, with two of them being fought over a la roshambo!  - Inconsistent Food: I will admit that Spring Sushi is, in my opinion, the most consistently acceptable AYCE place in terms of food quality. Though in the end you're paying for quantity and not quality (the large amount of rice in each roll), the food was still mostly pleasant. My issue was that some of the rice was warm, some if it was cool, a lot of it was underseasoned. Some sushi were well formed, others fell apart, others had too much rice, others had a good amount. With the huge volume of people to serve and even larger amount of orders being made, there's just a limit as to how good the food can be. Also, they're not going to spend the time remaking a roll that is normally subpar due to the work they have in front of them, comparing to when one orders a la cart.  As a general rule specific to Spring Sushi, the cooked items (especially the grilled/fried) were much more satisfying than the raw ones, and the ramen was salty with bland noodles, though I'm a sucker for Char siu and pork in general.  When we reached the point where we ended up wanting to keel over and rot away at some desolate corner of the world, we ordered dessert for one last hurrah. My friends were exclaiming how the Mango Ice Cream was so much more creamier/flavorful than other Japanese restaraunts, but I don't partake in mango ice cream myself and cannot substantiate these claims. My Green Tea wasn't cloyingly sweet, which I found great. When it came time to get the bill, the total came to around $20 after taxes.  That brings me to question: what is the value of a bloated stomach, a somewhat happy palette and the visceral joy of playing around with an iPad menu? Honestly, without the great company, I myself wouldn't choose to come back to Spring Sushi. However, with the right people, and if I'm particularly famished, I would quite possibly come back to Spring Sushi.  3.5/5 - closer to a 3 than a 4."}
{"text":"I hate to do this - I'm downgrading to 4 stars! I still really like this place but the service has slowed down somewhat. Still a great deal for downtown AYCE and still way way better than the Woo's that used to occupy the space!  Great menu, plenty of selection, and pretty solid quality, certainly better than I'd expect from a downtown Toronto AYCE place. At $8.99 including soup, salad, and dessert, the lunch special is a particular treat; come early for the patio which is fairly quiet and absolutely perfect for summertime. There's also an AYCE lunch for $15 that I tried today - very nice menu selection though it'd be nice to have an option to pay a bit extra for sashimi.  Dinner is something like $25 for a solid AYCE menu; the seafood fried rice is to die for, the sashimi is fresh, and they've even got some innovative rolls (their signature spring sushi roll was particularly good) and a fair selection of Thai food which is all quite tasty.  Grabbing a sapporo on the patio is a fabulous thing in the summertime too.  All that being said, for its value, solid menu, and great service (with a few very rare slips) this place still gets a strong recommendation as my top choice AYCE sushi in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Fast service but food used to be better quality (and value). Nice they take reservations online. Oddly our area smelled like bleach which made part of the unappetizing experience."}
{"text":"This is going to be the best sushi ever you have had in your life.... Luxury place, fast and respectfull attitude from staff, awesome sushiiiiiii and steak and......."}
{"text":"I have gone to Spring Sushi on multiple occasions and its overall a good AYCE option. Sushi rolls tend to have a lot of rice . Service is consistently fast and orders come very quickly even during busy times. Price is a bit on the higher side but I'd imagine you're paying for the view and the prime location. Would recommend if you're in the area, especially as a pre-movie lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"This is in an amazing location near the Eaton centre at Yonge-Dundas Square. All you can eat sushi is priced reasonably given their excellent quality. They have a wide selection, which includes soup and dessert. Everything tastes fresh and it keeps you full for the entire day. I love to come here for sushi because their service is excellent (they allow customers to use their iPads to order, and food is served fast). However, it is the wide selection that keeps me coming."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great. Kitchen food is amazing (especially the rice and beef dishes). They have a cute waiting area with iPads for entertainment. Lots of seating and always fresh. The only reason it lost a few stars is because there's better sushi out there close by and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Came here twice over the Christmas break, first with a friend and later with my girlfriend.   Between the two visits, I feel like I managed to sample most of the dishes in the place except for the Rice, The Udon and the Ramen. We had most of the sushi, 10 pieces of tuna sashimi, salmon, mackerel , rare beef, mango chicken, Coconut Shrimp and lots of other things. The only sour note were the rice roll arctic rolls.   The whole Ipad thing is a bit gimmicky and the service is hit and miss but its a decent spot for all you can eat."}
{"text":"I came here with a ton of friends a couple weeks ago both on a Monday and on a Thursday night! In comparison to other AYCE places I've been to, this one blew the others away. The restaurant is in a beautiful location and is really well decorated. As far as the service goes I would rate it a solid 7/10 only because I feel there were dishes brought to us we didn't order and also some we never got. We also ran out of water quite a few times and had to ask to have them refilled. The food quality for AYCE is far above others I've had before. I feel like everything was really flavorful and tasted fresh. Also it was a bit more expensive than other AYCE places I've been to. On one of the nights my friend shattered a glass in her hand and they rushed over to be sure she was alright. They made it a big priority to be sure she was okay and also to clean the glass and water off of our table. Overall I'm really impressed! (Which is why I requested to come back a second time my last night in Toronto) I'll definitely be back when I visit again!"}
{"text":"I came here for Ayce sushi and it was a great experience. The service was extremely quick and the sushi was scrumptious. The servers didn't forget to bring us anything like most restaurants do when you order Ayce sushi. I was really impressed.   On another occasion I ordered the mojito Soju  and it was phenomenal. My friend and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this restaurant. :-)  I'm giving them four stars because I just discovered the best sushi restaurant in Thornhill where all of the rolls are gourmet."}
{"text":"The place was alright for AYCE, the variety is ok (it has Thai food too), but somehow to me it feels like the sushis were not made...attentively, might because too much rice wrapped outside.  My friend likes the waiter who served us haha."}
{"text":"Still the best option for AYCE sushi downtown toronto. Can't beat the variety and the view overlooking Dundas Square.   Good spot and very central to everything - Eaton Centre, Cineplex, shopping and right off the subway line.  Service is super fast and I do admit sometimes the food doesn't come out as you ordered - being nice to the servers can really do the trick.  I've been in the restaurant service industry before and service hundreds of starving people for lunch or dinner rush is draining. It doesn't hurt for you to smile and thank them. You could make their day.  Been hooked on the torched sushi and they make a mean Lychee mojito.  So give those a try!   I like it here also because of a full bar and it's more chill - beer on tap, sake, mixed drinks and you can order a-la-carte sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay. It wasn't the best for AYCE Lunch. I thought the salmon wasn't that fresh and had a really fishy after taste. The dessert was just simple ice cream.   Overall 3 stars because it was edible and didn't get me sick"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for AYCE at lunchtime on a weekday. I have come here many times before but the food has never been as bad as it was for AYCE. For $17, you would expect the food to be decent but it was terrible. We found ourselves forcing the leftover rolls down our throats because of their policy that you must pay for the dishes you don't eat. The sushi was bland, the Thai food was weirdly coloured and unpleasant, the fried appetizers like spring rolls were even a let down. The only good food we had was a chicken skewer and the ice cream for desert. If you come here, I would HIGHLY recommend eating a la carte because the food quality is dramatically better. If you are in the neighbourhood and in the mood for sushi though, don't come here. Go to Spring Rolls just down the street or better yet, Kyoto, a small little sushi place 5 minutes down Dundas."}
{"text":"Loved eating here! I found the sushi to be very fresh and tasty and the service is super quick even though it was busy and very crowded. The have a wide variety of different sushi and soups and many things that I haven't heard of before and everything tasted great! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"My first visit was a Saturday night got a table right away. Service was great. The staff was friendly. I like the idea of pictures of the menu, so i loved the whole ordering off the ipad.The acye menu is huge and many to chose from.  The hostess showed us how to order and work the ipad. The food was great it came pretty fast. Great location and love the decor. One of my favorite restaurants !"}
{"text":"More on the expensive side. Average sushi. I guess you pay for the location.  Average customer service. Always busy."}
{"text":"Not a bad selection for all you can eat sushi but I have been to better with others when placing orders with an iPad. Restaurant was busy for lunch and they did bring out our food fast which was an added bonus. Wish they had more tofu options on the menu but it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I know we're all living in the digital age and blah blah blah, but the iPad menus were really rubbing me the wrong way.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my friend (a resident Ram), and apparently all the Ryerson kids go crazy over this sh*t. Now, we opted not to go for the AYCE menu, but we did grab a couple bento boxes. One thing that I've got to say, is that the iPad menus make things a little more difficult than it has to be. My bento box came with some sushi and sashimi. I'm the type of person that doesn't like certain sushi selections, so at a place where you order via waitress, there is no problem with make substitutions. At a place like Spring Sushi, you can't do this because there isn't a waitress to take your order.   For the price I paid, I could have gone to a cleaner, better serviced sushi joint on the Danforth, where I also get ice cream for free... and I pay about $2 less for the same items- if not more in my box. Crowd here was loud and obnoxious since it draws in the crazies and youngins that are enjoying the day downtown.   Take the subway to the Danforth or over to Spadina- you'll find better and cheaper sushi places there."}
{"text":"Great food... friendly staff, and great idea to let the customer use an iPad to place the orders. Food came quickly after being ordered, but some of the things we ordered never arrived... however, the waiters, waitresses and even the manager, tried as hard as they could to please the customer, and they did a great job. I'll be returning for sure, to try many more different dishes that I couldn't order because  I was already full."}
{"text":"Location: 10 Dundas Street E (replaced Woo restaurant) Price: $$-$$$ Server: Alright  Sushi has became so mainstream for the pass few years and it's rare to find a good sushi place- it's no longer just for hipsters...haha just kidding but seriously where do I go for a great sushi place?!  Spring sushi has replace Woo Restaurant and according to my friend it looks much brighter. It was my first time ever at Spring sushi and their furniture were quite modern and clean cut. This is my experience for their lunch all you can eat. They only take credit card or cash; there is a ATM machine for debit users.This restaurant has Ipads to order... It is becoming a trend where restaurants use Ipads for customers to order food. The bright side to this for sushi restaurant is that customers don't have to guess what kind of sushi they are ordering- especially for first timers. Which I think is a great.   I personally didn't enjoy their sushi much. It tasted a little weird to me; I think they had too much vinegar in their rice. The proportion small- which isn't a bad thing because they have quite a variety. Their mango ice cream was delicious though. Overall, the sushi itself wasn't the best or that great to be honest. I've had better sushi- I feel like a lot of people raved about this place is because of how polished it looks. The service was alright nothing particularly odd or exceptional.  Verdict: Try it out if you just want to go there for the environment."}
{"text":"Had a particularly awful experience here last weekend and I thought I would share.  It was my boyfriend's birthday and he wanted to have sushi, so three of us came to Spring Sushi for a late all-you-can-eat sushi lunch. We came in and were told to sit while our table was prepared. We arrived right before they switched over from lunch service, but we were still charged the extra $10 a person for dinner. We weren't about to leave over something like that, so we stayed and ordered.  You order via an iPad, which is great if you're alone or ordering for the table, but not so great when three people are trying to add things family-style and mistakenly being double- or triple-ordered. I can't imagine doing it with a large group, so congrats if you're able to get through it without pulling your hair out. Our app also crashed midway through and we had to get someone to reset it. After 20 minutes of fiddling and confirming what we all wanted, we submitted our first order.   The waiter came by and asked us for our beer order. We told him we had already ordered one (large Asahi) on the screen, and he walked away without taking our tea order, since you can't order plain green tea on the iPad - if it's there, it's not under the tea section. We had to flag down another waiter for our tea order, and everything else during the course of our meal, since that was the last time we saw our waiter.  I would rate the food itself at around 2.5 stars. The sashimi was good; everything else was below average. There was no tuna on the all-you-can-eat menu, which was extremely disappointing. Several of our items were never delivered, and we didn't receive any food other than appetizers until about 50 minutes from sitting down (20 minutes fiddling with the iPad and 30 minutes for the food to get there).   I called for a manager after about an hour and 15 minutes, due to the missing orders and the long waits for food (we had ordered a second round at this point and were still waiting). He apologized and offered us 20% off our meal, which was fine. He had someone come over and fill our tea, and we got our missing orders. When the bill came (we had to flag down yet another server to bring it), our meal was not discounted. We had to actually walk to the other side of the restaurant to remind the manager we were supposed to get a discount, which was very embarrassing. The manager brought us our correct bill, and after waiting for someone to pick up my credit card, I eventually had to get up again to chase down someone who would take it.  Total time, from walking in to walking out: 2 hours and 10 minutes, and still hungry.  I was totally unimpressed with this experience. The only saving grace was the fact that the Zombie Walk was happening and we had a window view, so we had something to look while we waited for our food.  I would recommend this place to people who only care about the novelty of ordering food on an iPad. The food was below average and the service was abysmal.  One more note: there were about 3 families waiting to be sat when we left. There were plenty of tables open, but apparently they do not have enough iPads for every table so these people actually had to wait until we were done so they could get our iPad. There is no alternative way of ordering. Completely backwards."}
{"text":"I've been to a fair share of ayce sushi places and besides the atmosphere, this place isn't really that exceptional. I thought it was cool that we got to use ipads but every time you want to send an order you have to get a waiter to come and do it. That doesn't feel so classy and high tech anymore. The sushi was average, which is good but not anything to make me want to return there specifically unless I'm already in the building."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I have been here dozens of times. I'm not a fan of the customer service, but I thought , \"hey, I'll give it another try, (then another, then another, maybe they're just super busy and maybe they've had a long day\"   The service here is probably the worst in Toronto.   First off I believe they're homophobic. They made My partner and I feel very uncomfortable. we were told there was no wait time but had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Please note that they seated people before us.We asked if we could not sit beside the entrance seeing as they get very busy and people crowd around and push up against your table. The girl huffed and let out an inappropriate sigh. any time we asked for something they rolled their eyes and made a big deal about it. Very unprofessional. They finally sat us at a table, brought us water and the device to start our order. We selected a bunch of food and then the same rude woman came up to us, told us we had to move tables because it was reserved for someone else. She then picked up the menu device and erased everything we were about to order.  The food is not fresh - what so ever. I had to soak my fish in soya to get rid of the fishy taste. We waited for bout 30 minutes for our first round and only brought half the amount we ordered. I think the best thing about the restaurant is the lemon water...   Over all, don't come here. You'll probably get food poisoning. (Maybe not) but you'll definitely get terrible service.  Oh also I found hair in my food. After that we were done, we didn't finish our food.  It was very busy and the one server was nice and could see our frustration so we still tipped well (just because the food is bad and most of the service was terrible the one server still deserves a tip) but we will not be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I come here a lot. Service is fast, the inside is pretty lively during lunch, patio is usually quite empty because they don't do AYCE on the patio.   The patio overlooks Yonge and has a decent view; it's high enough that there's a good breeze going all the time.   The food, however, is mediocre. On my most recent visit I ordered a torched roll and spicy salmon roll a la carte. While the torched roll was delicious, the spicy salmon roll was dry and tasted old. Still, I would probably come back because of the location and service."}
{"text":"For the best value come at lunch time on a week day. Ryerson students get discount but make sure to bring your student id!  Great place for large groups.  Super quick service, and there are tons of options on the menu.  Make sure to order a little at a time, some orders include several pieces."}
{"text":"I love eating sushi here, it is jus the best. The menu is huge, and everything is so so good! If you are ready to eat a lot, the best thing to do is to go for the \"All you can eat\", amazing deal! Service is fast.  My favourite sushi restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"Spring sushi used to be my favourite AYCE sushi. Restaurant in dt ... about two to three years ago. Now their AYCE sucks because their maki rolls are massive ! I came here with my girlfriend and she was full off just one make set because they were so gigantic.  In addition, it is the most expensive AYCE in Toronto. That is probably due to its prime location and amazing selection of food. A few years ago , Spring would have been a 4.5 because of its quality and selection. Now it's a 2 because even though it's selection is good ... it's quality sucks"}
{"text":"Ugh ordered a spicy salmon handroll and they gave me a handroll with only rice and tempura bits. Service was slow. Food kinda sucks."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical to try this place because of the reviews I read. Despite the negative comments my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. We went on a Saturday for lunch, they weren't overly busy so we got seated right away. (OpenTable reservation recommended) The hostess that sat us was unable to answer many of our \"first-timer\" questions, thankfully our server came quickly to help us figure out the tablet ordering system. We did the all you can eat sushi lunch which was an amazing deal for the price we paid. The portions here for the all you can eat are similar to what you would receive at a tapas restaurant which made it easier to try more of the menu. They brought the plates to our table as they came up so there was always something new to try after each bite. There are so many different types of food to try even the pickiest person should be able to find something they will enjoy. Don't let a couple sushi snobs ruin this place for you, go make that decision yourself. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience ever. Food was absolutely horrendous. I have never left an all you can eat sushi bar still hungry, but me and the party of 4 that I came with all did. The food was absolutely dreadful. Flavorless. The service was also nearly non-existant when we came. Someone at the table also ordered the pad thai (I know its a sushi place, but i wasnt the one who ordered it! :P) and it was also just totaly flavourless. I came here maybe a month ago? so I don't remember everything we ordered, but we all did AYCE. All of us found the whole experience and food dreadful. The one thing out of all the food we tried that was bearable/decent was the grilled salmon.  Like I said, we all left very disappointed and feeling like we got jipped. The decor was quite nice and we were expecting that we would have a good experience, but all of us left still hungry/not full... even though we got AYCE.... we just couldn't deal with the horrid quality of the food.  OH, and to top it all off, when I went to the washroom before leaving, there was this smell in the air....... yes.. its a washroom.. but no... it was worse.... I walked into the stall .. what do I find? Oh there's just poop sitting on the floor. Nope, not the floor of the toilet, the FLOOR FLOOR. (I cant really blame the business for this necessarily. They aren't monitoring where their clientele poop! [For all I know it may have happened seconds before i walked in] But it just ended up reflecting the overall experience haha. Oh, what an end to a dinner...)"}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE sushi options in the city. They have a few special items like torched salmon sushi, and a relatively robust selection of cooked items like coconut shrimp. They can do a little better on their sashimi selection but that's ok. I'm personally getting sick of eating sashimi.   I have no idea why we had to wait about 10 mins when there were tables available. Another pair of patrons before us also got the same waiting treatment. Service is more or less what you expect from a Chinese owned place. The staff are prettier and dress better than your typical AYCE but I don't really care. You use an ipad to order which I suppose removes a lot of potential mistakes. It's more for style than function. I'm here for the food. If I have to flag you down to order each time, I don't mind. Being able to visualize the item is a nice touch though but I'm already very familiar with AYCE sushi options.  The food itself was good. No complaints about anything I tried. I was impressed by their shrimps in general. Very large meaty shrimps. I ordered several shrimp dishes and was very happy. Seasoning is what I expected the food to taste. Nothing revolutionary. Just done well. The special \"rectangular sushi\" selection were very good and innovative. Sushi were just standard AYCE fish to rice ratio. Rolls were pretty good and decent stuff to rice ratio.   Decor is definitely on the upscale side for an AYCE place.  As expected, prices are higher here. But IMO it's worth it. I will come back on a special occasion. A regular AYCE place is enough to satisfy my regular cravings. The special items here are nice not enough enough incentive to keep me coming here to pay the premium."}
{"text":"Good sushi, a bit pricey but expected it to be since its in the heart of the downtown core. They have AYCE and bentos, and my friends and I opted for the bento box. It's spacious and it has an urban and classy aesthetic. Noise level is moderate, so you can carry good conversation there and the space is very inviting. Located on the 3rd floor of the AMC."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but I've had better. I probably wouldn't come back. It was pricy for what it was."}
{"text":"Over priced food not worth the price. Wait staff too busy trying to look like they're modeling to look at u. No traditional feel to the restaurant at all. Only good thing was the shrimp tempura. Tried it cuz of the ipad hype but realized some things should just be done the old fashioned way.. this isnt the jetsons"}
{"text":"The food is okay. When I went there with my boyfriend, I found that my friend is working there. So the service is so good. I might go back just because my friend is there, but not because of the food."}
{"text":"Bleh... I came here two years ago and thought it was the best ayce sushi and was happy to pay their higher prices compared to other ayce nearby. I returned recently with a friend and it was a very disappointing experience. While ordering on the iPad is a fun and convenient method for ayce... the food was just very sub par. I don't know what it was but everything we ordered from tempura, to sushi, to edamame and the BBQ ribs, even dessert just had the same bland, oily flavour. Halfway through my friend and I looked at each other and said \" we shouldn't have come here for sushi\".   It's disappointing, but at all ayce sushi locations in toronto always end up sacrificing quality over quantity. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The menu looks amazing, but the sushi was old. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and it looked like beef it was so brown I couldn't eat it. I sent everything back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst part of my experience in Toronto! The food was cold, staff was unfriendly, food was tasteless and dirty. When we first arrived the table was cleared but the napkins on the table had spot of spattered food. Sure fine, i could ask for different napkin. We ordered food and it came out within 2 minutes! Okay it could be that fast sure. But it was COLD! It was already made food that just brought out to our table. We ordered noodle and we waited for a while. Then we asked the waiter and he said it was sold out!!!!! Okay VINCENT, you should tell us it was sold out BEFORE we order the food, not after we waited 30 minutes. Oh yeah by the way this place charge almost $20 for this shitty stuff!! Please do not make sure yourself of victim of this tasteless, dirty, and unfriendly place."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is that you can order it electronically,the drinks, the food and the service are HORRIBLE. I've been to many all you can eatbplaces, and this place is probably the worst, the servers were extremely rude and the overall experience was rushed and unpleasant, made me wish I had eaten at home instead. I guess this place is so appealing due to the location and the electronic ordering, but the quality of it is horrible, if you're looking for decent sushi and a half decent experience DO NOT go here, it is loud and unpleasant the sushi tastes industrialized somehow?   Bottom line I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was really fun to eat at! I enjoyed their selection & everything that was fed to me. The ambiance was nice & the iPad made the ordering process very easy. I've gone as part of a large group & with just one other person. All of the times, the restaurant was accommodating & the waiters were nice. Even during extremely busy times, the food came out at considerable times.  The only down side is that the AYCE is a bit pricey, but I mean it is right next to Eaton Center! So it's super convenient to eat at when you're hanging out around Dundas Square :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for AYCE sushi. Everything is fresh, delicious and your food comes out at lightning speed. Being able to order off the ipad is very convenient.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the girls who work here are stuck up. I think they're forgetting that they work at a sushi joint, not a designer boutique."}
{"text":"The location of this place would make the restaurant craaazy busy during lunchtime. Despite the lunch rush, there was always a server promptly at our table. They're great at their jobs! So many different servers served us, we weren't sure who would get the tip. I loved the IPad ordering system but the lunch menu was very limited. I've been to other AYCE sushi places during lunch with more variety. However the quality and presentation of the food made up for that."}
{"text":"I am kind of food lover i love to try different foods but sushibis my all time love & this is one of the tastier sushi i have tried so far."}
{"text":"I feel like Spring Sushi used to have a reputation for being one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in downtown Toronto, but I feel like instead of upholding that standard they just rely on this reputation for business.   We were a party of four (January 2018) and were seated quickly. We were handed an iPad and started to order. The food was mediocre and all of the things we ordered did not come to the table. My boyfriend had to inform the waiter and then all of sudden the previous orders came rushing in. The quality of the food was bad and paying such a premium I definitely expected more. However, our waiter was attentive and I felt bad because he had zero control over what the kitchen decided to cook or not to cook.   So, don't come here unless you really have to."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were treated to spring sushi by her mother and godmother as they visited from Chile. This was a self order sushi place by iPad, the sushi was so fresh and delicious with many options, I can't wait for my return."}
{"text":"I came here as a group of eight on Nuit Blanche 2013. As expected, it was very busy when we arrived at 7 PM. As we did not have a reservation, we were told that we'd have to wait. Cool, that's what we get for not reserving on a busy night. But why were we forced to stand in the hottest, worst ventilated area of the whole restaurant? Everyone who was waiting for a table was crammed into an area with a few iPads for entertainment. It was extremely stuffy with no seating and no airflow. It felt really gross, despite it being cold outside, so it wasn't like their air conditioning wasn't working or something. We ended up waiting in that small, hot area for over an hour. By this point we were all desperate for food and really wanted to get \"all we could eat\".   We were seated at a table near the kitchen and shown how to order using the iPads at the table. That was pretty cool because I had never eaten at a place that used an iPad to order food. We proceeded to choose a bunch of different items on the menu, like we always do at any other all-you-can-eat sushi place. A few minutes later, a server came to our table and reviewed the choices we made on the iPad (I thought the purpose of using iPads at restaurants is to eliminate the time waiting for the server to take the order?), then told us to take 2/3 of the items off our order because we wanted to get \"too much\" and the kitchen wouldn't be able to handle it. Really?? We didn't expect all of our food to come out immediately (it wouldn't fit on the small table anyway) - the kitchen can't handle staggering a large order over a long period of time? Pretty ridiculous. Anyway, we cut our order in half and it got sent to the kitchen.  By the time our food started arriving, it was around 8:45, so we started stuffing our faces. The food was pretty good for an all-you-can-eat place, except for the \"Crispy Spicy Roll\". Wow, that thing is gross. There are no item descriptions on the iPad menu, so we figured it would be something interesting and tasty. Nope. It was rice, seaweed and a ton of tempura batter in the middle. The sashimi we got was alright, definitely nothing to rave about, but none of us got sick, so I can't complain too much.   The food came out in staggered bursts, until it finally stopped arriving around 9:30. A bunch of the items we ordered were skipped, so we reordered them, along with the other half of the order that we were forced to cancel an hour earlier. After placing the new order, items from our old order started coming to the table. Whoops, we assumed those dishes were lost because it took so long. Well, believe it or not, the second order took EVEN LONGER. While waiting for the food, we were waiting for someone to notice that all of our cups of water were empty. After at least twenty minutes of waiting, we finally flagged someone down to refill our glasses.  Only a few items arrived before we decided to take off at 10:30 because we were missing Nuit Blanche, which was the whole reason we went downtown. I really wanted the udon soup that I ordered TWICE, but it never came. We paid the bill and left unsatisfied. Pathetic.  The girls that were at my table all made note of the fact that there was no toilet paper in THREE of the stalls in the women's restroom. I'm not sure if the situation was any better in the men's washroom, but seriously, if three stalls have no toilet paper, I think that's a sign that nobody's on restroom duty.   The price was more than I'd usually pay for AYCE, but this place is in the heart of Downtown Toronto, so you pay for the location...and the iPads. There is an outdoor patio area that seems to offer a great view, so that might interest those who want something to look at while waiting for their food.  Based on the poor service, slow kitchen, stuffy atmosphere and high price, I would not come back here again unless I was invited to a birthday dinner or found a really great Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Spring Sushi used to be my favourite AYCE sushi place, but the food quality has gone down so much compared to when they first opened. I used to think it was worth it, but honestly it really isn't anymore.   A few good things that have not changed, is that the interior very modern, they use an iPad menu, the washrooms are clean, and they do have a 10% student discount (you have to ask for it, because they don't normally advertise it).  Based on my many visits, here are some things that I have experienced:  They don't accept debit.  Sometimes, they bring me my order, twice. As well, sometimes I would order, a certain quantity of the single-order items, and they would bring me more than I ordered (I order according to how much I know I can finish).  They put so much rice in the rolls, with a pinch of fish. Honestly, the ratio was ridiculous.  The service can be very slow, which is understandable when they're super busy.  A few times, I've been seated at a table where it was still wet from being wiped down by a towel, with the smell of dirty towel lingering.   Sometimes the iPad has nasty, sticky finger marks on them.  And usually, when I'm ordering my last order, I include my dessert as well, and most of the time, they bring my dessert before the other rolls or entrees. Or, they would bring me my ice cream, and finally the deep fried banana after the ice cream melts.  That is all I have to say, unfortunately I will not be returning after that last visit."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Monday and paid $25.99 which I find was a bit expensive considering it was a Monday and there was a lack of choices. Also I wasn't informed that they do not accept debit until I was seated which was a bummer because I was planning on paying by debit.   The service was okay; they were kind but nothing special.   The food was below par in my opinion. The sushi rolls had a lot of rice (especially the salmon rolls) which made it chewy and hard to eat. The rice had an onion overload. Honestly out of everything I ordered I really only liked the salmon teriyaki. Overall there was a lack of options (I.e 2 ice cream flavours; green tea and mango) and the food was below average compared to other AYCE places.   I would not recommend nor would I go back"}
{"text":"Tried Spring Sushi yesterday. Extremely pricey for mediocre food. Service is perhaps the worst I ever seen in Toronto - reservation for our table was given away and the hostess made us wait for over an hour and kept leading us on by saying that there will be a table avaliable shortly (we could have just left if we know there will be a long wait). Talked with two managers, the younger one is a douche and basically tell us to fuck off when we complained. The other one at least offer us a discount and show that he care about the customers. Overall, a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Nice upscale restaurant, rocks the ipad menu but the food just lacks good quality.  Service is slow on busy days lunch hours. staff are nice. To be honest, this place has gone down hill since it opened. Quality is very bad now and I did not have a good time.  don't believe me , try it yourself, if you dont like it, open up a yelp account and share my opinion."}
{"text":"4.0 everything was quite good.  quality wise on the better side than most sushi restsurants.  however food and beers took a while to come out. setvice seemed a bit sparse."}
{"text":"All you can eat is completely worth. The salmon sashimi is really fresh! Great location too."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure if Spring Sushi is a huge upgrade from it's predecessor Woo. The space is bright and modern but reminds me much of a Japanese cafeteria lacking in much personality and real ambiance. It's stark, sterile, and very fast food-ish like. The idea of ordering off iPads lost it's appeal fairly quickly to me when I realized that the item descriptions are often vague, assuming you know Japanese food already. An improvement on the information provided would be helpful, especially when they are equipped with such a functional tool.  The food here is pretty decent, it's all your basic Japanese fare, and some more interesting dishes were listed in the menu but I didn't try them. The speed each item was made and delivered was quick when I went both times. And I found the service pleasant and fast enough. Both the times I went, once during lunch and the other during dinner the restaurant hardly had any guests in it. Seems like they're pretty slow. I personally think their AYCE dinner price is steep for what you're getting up there. It's $25.99/person. Which I'd happily pay for if the place was posh and shiny and had tons of atmosphere along with the good service and decent menu. The lunch price is much more fair at $16 I believe.  All in all, I don't think I'll go back if I don't have to. A good place to drop in if you're around the area and need a quick decision on where to go. But don't bust your hump to try out this new place, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"I go here often as it is one of my fave AYCE Sushi Restaurants. Lots of options besides Sushi and the smaller portions allow you to have better control over how much you eat so you if you overdo it, it's deliberate. Service is always great and fast. Food is fresh (nothing more uncomfortable than extra chewy salmon). It is AYCE so if you're expecting fine dining then go somewhere else. The only annoyance is the fact that they only accept Cash or Credit as payment. Also I would avoid the spicy rolls are there is usually way too much tempura and rice in there."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in downtown. Service is fast, sushi is always great and service is always kind to make changes if needed.   I understand the quality of fish may not be the most (authentic) as some customers prefer however, in my opinion, i do enjoy the fish farmed quality of seafood for sushi over the higher quality wild seafood.   Main reason i love their sushi is because of their spicy Mayo. Make sure you explicitly ask for it. Good luck"}
{"text":"O melhor All You Can Eat (AYCE) da região. Cardápio do jantar com mais variedades que no almoço, porém mais caro. De qualquer forma é um excelente local para ir a qualquer horário. Comida boa e serviço excelente."}
{"text":"Whenever I go it's always extremely busy, so I recommend getting a reservation. However, everything else is great! Service is friendly and fast. I went with 3 friends once and we got AYCE for lunch. It is a bit on the more expensive side but for the quality of the food it's totally worth it. I'd rather pay more and have better food for sure. The raw fish is very fresh and everything else is very flavourful and well presented. The restaurant itself has a lovely modern interior and it feels very well kept. Definitely check out this restaurant if you are contemplating it!"}
{"text":"It's average. For the location, price is decent especially for an AYCE.  But for menu wise, there isn't too much that really sets it apart from other AYCE Japanese Restaurants. Rather limited menu options (~60 or so?) whereas other places like Matsuda have over 100 for the same price.  Good part is that food comes quick - but this also questions how the food is made and when it was made. Submitted the food orders when arrived and food came within a minute - this include hot orders like pan fried items, or grilled items. Needless to say these items were dry and sorta stale.  Would I return? Probably not. Was it worth the money? Maybe $15-20 at most.  Save yourself the money and come during lunch when it's about $11 cheaper than dinner for the same menu items."}
{"text":"This was one of the first few AYCE sushi locations in Toronto where you can order on an iPad. The selection and variety of sushi is huge! Unfortunately, the food itself is mediocre. You're paying for the atmosphere (great view of Yonge and Dundas) and the iPad technology. With tax and tip, AYCE lunch is around $20 on a weekday. And there was no ice cream one time when I went!"}
{"text":"-food is OK; it's reasonably priced considering it's located at the heart of the city  -service is atrocious--not that they're rude, but rather super slow. the iPad ordering system is unique, but faulty, especially for a big party.   -food didn't come out at one point; staff blamed it on the iPad system. turns out it wasn't faulty after all; their kitchen was just slow.  -never return again--not worth the hr+ wait"}
{"text":"This place is seriously bomb dot com!  Came here with my boyfriend's cousin and group of friends for an AYCE experience that surprised and changed my outlook on AYCE.    This is a cool restaurant, the service is pretty fast here, lovely view of the center, and your food comes out fairly quick too!  For $25 you can have all the sushi, thai, grilled meat, udon, ramen, fried rice, dessert and more!! That to me was the biggest deal I've ever seen and was the best!  You get to try everything and this is a great spot for big groups, I mean the way the tables were designed it looked like it was for big parties.    Ordering food was a cool concept, it was on an ipad and man was it hard to decide what to order.  Don't eat with your eyes!! haha.  The pictures are great and trust me, it'll be very tempting to tap multiple orders of certain dishes.  The food comes out in small portions which is a good thing, because then you'll have more space to try out other things on the menu, and you'll need that space! ;)  Some of my favorite dishes were the:  -Grilled beef wrapped with Enoki -Mango Salad -Salmon Rose -Ramen -Spicy Handroll -Pad Thai -Tom Yum Soup -Shrimp with Garlic Sauce -Eggplant -Green Tea IceCream  There were a lot of other dishes, but I can't remember them all.  I just know that everything that everyone ordered did not disappoint and was well worth it for sure!  I forgot about some of the things I had ordered in the beginning and got them at the end, and some that I think were given to us when we didn't even order it.  Oh well, no biggie. haha ;)   Overall this restaurant was really good and I would love to come back here whenever I visit Toronto again! :)"}
{"text":"I came not sure exactly what to expect, but as the evening went I became pleasantly surprised. This AYCE is set atop as a rooftop restaurant on Dundas Square and I was overlooking the main square.  The food is ordered on tablets with many choices, very friendly staff, and the food was served amazingly fast.  With all the choice and speed of the food, I am happy to say - quality did not suffer. The dishes are tasty and presentation nicely done.  A place I will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I'd like to bump it up after my visit here yesterday.  We stopped by here before going to a concert.  I'd just like to note:  1. The Octopus balls were amazing. 2. The Kalbi was 100000 times better. Thick cut, and delicious. 3. The Tiramisu was out :("}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday dinner. We were 16 people and there was space for all of us. They separated us into three groups with an iPad each for ordering but failed to tell us that the orders weren't linked to each other. Our reservation was for 8PM and we had to wait for the previous diners to finish up their meal before seating us. Goes to show that convenience and popularity gets this place visits.   Food was alright - ample selection of hot, cold foods, appetizer and sushi ~ the cuts could be a higher grade and service could have been better. You order on the iPad and it's verified by one of the staff members. They served everything on one side of the table out of convenience and the orders took long to come out   Come here if you enjoy variety. Go someplace else if you want a higher grade of sushi. Won't come back unfortunately.. price point and mediocre sushi detract me"}
{"text":"Although this AYCE sushi isn't that authentic, you can't beat the price given its location. Their lunch buffet is only $15 and it includes as much sushi as you can stomach.  We visit the place regularly and even though the sushi quality is sub-par to say the least, you have a wide selection of rolls to try out. You can also try their tempura and other cooked dishes which are actually better than the sushi.  And another cool part is that every table is given an iPad where you make your order. You simply select the dishes you want, add them to your meal \"cart\", hit confirm, and it will arrive on your table shortly after! Very efficient which I like.  Overall, I enjoy coming here as you get amazing value for your money."}
{"text":"For a large chain expected more. Worse than  the sushi you get from Metro."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I have to say the food is below average. Well, I guess you just cannot expect better food from this place, considering its price and location."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 stars. Went there on Sunday evening around 6.30pm for AYCE dinner. Waited for less than 5mins for a table. They have an open patio with a view on the North West side of Yonge & Dundas. Everything is ordered through an iPad, which is quite convenient as we can modify our quantity as we'd like and we have an image of how each food looks like. They have a lot of variety food, including rice, udon, sashimi, sushi, rolls hand rolls, fried rice, appetizers, soups. Their AYCE dinner is $27.99 + $2 on Fridays/weekends/holidays, so we each paid $29.99 + tax + tips.  Food was good, except for their rolls, which contained more rice than filling, and each bite felt heavy. For our first and 2nd order, our foods came quite quick and accurate. When we were on our 3rd and 4th order, it took time for the server to come and send our order to the kitchen (waited like 10mins) and the food took more time to come too and we were missing some orders. We told the server about our missing food and waited, but nothing came. So we went on ordering out desserts. As soon as the desserts came, our missing orders came together, including chicken teriyaki.   Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Price: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Spring sushi is a Japanese/other Asian food restaurant that has both AYCE and a la carte options. The cool part is ordering food using iPads, so you can easily see what is ordered so far. The food was average, it's not the highest quality Japanese food. However, at $25.99/person for AYCE, it's not a bad place to try in downtown core. It's located at Yonge-Dundas square, so it's perfect for a dinner and movie date."}
{"text":"Spring Sushi is one of the best AYCE sushi places I've been to.  I came here on a date with my girlfriend for dinner and we both loved it.    The food is great for AYCE sushi.  You have a great variety and it's all on the iPad menu for you to see.  I had no complaints about the food at all.  I thought service was great.  A server would come within a minute of us setting our order on the iPad.  Food was delivered withing 5-15 minutes, which I thought was amazing.  The servers were very friendly as well.  I've read some reviews saying the service was horrible but I had no problems at all, and it was a relatively busy night.  I thought this place had a great atmosphere.  It was on the louder side (as all AYCE places are) but it wasn't that bad.  It's also situated very nicely on Yonge and Dundas, perfect for a movie or mall date.  Overall, I had a great time here and I'd like to go again sometime.  The price is slightly steep but it's not too bad.  I'd give my experience here an 8/10"}
{"text":"The place is okay, wouldn't class it the best. When you first walk in it feels really fancy but the quality of maki rolls isn't that great and not much selection as other ones I've been too. The salmon sushi was good, very thin cut and I like that. It was super hot in here that we were sweating which while On a date this wasn't ideal, however we have been togather for 6 years so doesn't matter much but I could see it being embarrassing for new couples or people just dating. Along with it being really hot inside it was nice outside there is a patio but you can't sit out there for the AYCE you can only order food your going to pay for. We waited a bit for spring rolls and tempura and never received them finally we just called the bill and the server felt so bad he gave us 10% off the server and manager we're extremely nice but the hostess didn't seem that happy."}
{"text":"Great concept and it works quite well. In the one time I have been here, I would definitely come back. I would like to see the restaurant when it's af peak hours, at lunch or prime dinner time. Ordering with the iPads makes everything pretty efficient and it's a great innovative concept. The portions are pretty small too, so it's no worry if you're trying to be attentive to portions or want to order multiple orders. Overall great experience and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! I never really had bad experience here at all but only thing I have to say is the place is a bit pricey and they could probably offer a little bit more menu items in terms of dessert and cook dishes but other than that I have nothing to complain about the taste of the sushi or cooked food :)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy this place. Over the past few years since they opened the prices have gone slightly up but I have noticed that the portion sizes have as well. As a picky person that isn't particularly into sushi at all, this place gives me a lot more options to choose from which keeps me and my sushi loving friends happy all at the same time. I probably would never go for dinner as the price does goes up for it and I don't like enough items to want to pay $26 dollars to go however, their tiramisu is pretty darn good and can only be found on their dinner menu options.   I love that you can order off the iPad, there are free refills (HELLO!) and the servers are really great with going to your table once your order is put and delivering your items in a timely manner.   Aside from that, I will continue stopping by this place for lunch here and there to get my garlic steak and tempura fix.   Keep it up Spring Sushi!"}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this place. You got to try LASVEGAS.  Vivaaaaaa lasvegassssssssss. Lol. Its warm,creamy and yummy."}
{"text":"A great all you can eat sushi place for the price with decent service. It's a nice place for groups although I've only been once but other friends have raved about it as well. Their shrimp was fresh and some of the waiters were very nice eye candy ;)  It's probably not a place to go everyday because there isn't a huge variety but treat yo' self once in a while to Spring Sushi!"}
{"text":"The place was packed when we got there for dinner. We waited quite awhile but it was worthwhile. It's basically your typical AYCE sushi place but the sashimi were quite fresh. It still isn't as good as compared to the other place we normally go to in Mississauga though. The menu selections are quite large. Food came pretty fast though even though the restaurant was bustling with people. The cooked food portion is decent. Environment wise, it was quite loud and noisy. We could barely hear each other talk even just across the table. So if you want to go to a restaurant where you can talk, this isn't the place. Also it was a bit on the pricier side for AYCE. All in all it was yummy, but if I have to compare it to my go to spot in Mississauga, the menu, price, how food was served are all comparable and very similar right down to the layout and app on the iPad menu with the only exception that the fish at Spring Sushi didn't match up to the freshness of the other restaurant."}
{"text":"Overpriced, noisy and far from intimate. Numerous items that we ordered never came. Surprise, they were their \"featured\" items and sashimi (the most costly for them I suppose). We mentioned it to the manager, and about an hour into our meal *some* of the missing items arrived. Nothing about this place makes me want to return. $75 for two people at dinner with one beer (I drank water). The sushi was mediocre at best. Way too much rice, and all of the rolls were drowning in mayo or was fried and greasy."}
{"text":"Great food and variety of items, however keep in mind if you are in the buffet menu the items you ordered will add up. So I recommend ordering all the food at once. Also, the iPad menu was kinda faulty in the sense that it would double the items or will not call the server to confirm it. Otherwise the food was great and loved the White Tuna and the salmon hand roll."}
{"text":"Came here on a fairly empty day. We ordered a bunch of things on the iPad. Conveniently, the fried food, soups, kitchen dishes came in one after another for 20 minutes. Took the sushi about 25 minutes to arrive. Classic AYCE buffet move.  The sushi was okay. I don't have much complaints for their quality. I did however order a crispy sushi roll thinking it had salmon in it. (Crispy Salmon Roll.) It was 95% tempura shreds and 5% spicy mayo. Not the most impressive sushi so I ate 4 pieces and  left two pieces on a tray to throw away. I stacked it up on top of the 4-5 other empty trays I had. The waitress came by and took the top tray off the stack and put it back on our table LOL. Seriously?  I'm a student and my girlfriend is too. She looked through her bag as the waitress waited. She said she couldn't find it and the waitress responds, \"No student ID? Ok.\" and walks off to get the bill. What an attitude. She was genuinely trying to find her ID and didn't bring it. Give the customer a break and give her the discount. Whose really winning in the end here?  For 17$, I would have expected way better customer service at Spring Sushi. I'd rather eat at Kyoto house where the price is 4$ cheaper for AYCE lunch. Their customer service isn't the greatest but at least they don't charge a premium for it."}
{"text":"MEEEEHHH.... I love me some Sushi 168 but this was a bit of a disappointment. I came here back when it was Woo, and the decor was much funkier. I don't like the lack of salad bar. YOU eat your own stupid seaweed salad when it comes in a Barbie sized bowl!!!!! We ended up coming for lunch and paid 16.99 per person, on a weekend, which is pricey but I get it since this is a pretty expensive chain.  All the rolls was good quality, fresh, not too much rice. Choices for lunch are pretty poor - not going to come back unless it's dinner.  iPad ordering like at 168 so a plus for that, very convenient.   REALLY liked the spicy salmon sushi.   They wouldn't let us do AYCE on the patio. PFT.  I wouldn't come back for lunch, dinner yes - if i was in the area and craving sushi. And lets be honest, when am I not craving sushi..."}
{"text":"1. They charged me 1 dollar extra to make my tempura dish set just all vegetables b/c I am a vegetarian. Which does not make any sense because meat ALWAYS cost more than vegetables anyways. But I let it go peacefully and said okay to that.  2. I was waiting so long for someone to get me steamed rice which came with my combo and NOPE took so long was done my food. They gave me the option to get 10% off my meal or the rice packed to go. I just said yes to the 10% off. But the fact that they charged me $1 to have all vegetarian just balanced the bill out and really got 40 cents off my meal.  3. My friends darn chicken was raw as hell!! Chicken so raw that it was clucking back at her!! She also cooks chicken at her job so she knows a raw chicken when she sees one. So the Manager came and was telling her it was not and mushed the raw chicken up with a fork to show her like it was about to get unraw or something like that. But he did offer her a new chicken but my friend was too full to enjoy it by the time it arrived.   Overall: We did not get AYCE and it was a Wed night. The servers didn't really check up on us. This place focuses more on quantity than quality. Not coming again, if we were to have tried AYCE we would have probably hated our experience still. Just happy our bill was not $30+ after what we experienced. Gonna just go to Milestone next door next time even if the wait is longer. People you have now been warned."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the worst sushi restaurants ever. Fish was wet and slippery, bad texture. Rolls were loose, too big and messy. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So, let me start out by saying that the service here was great - efficient, friendly, and accurate.  The technology of ordering on an iPad was great, and worked well.  But there's a reason I can always get a table here -without reservation or wait - at 7PM on a Thursday or Friday night.  Typical of all-you-can-eat places, the price is elevated for not so great sushi.  The eel smelled fishy, the white tuna sashimi was oily, and the salmon rolls tasted old.  The fried udon noodles were acceptable, but the sauteed vegetables that accompanied one dish were barely - if at all - cooked, and the beef that accompanied the other was overcooked.  The edamame were bland and completely tasteless (soybeans don't have much of a natural flavour, but fresh roasted and salted they can taste rather nice), and other dishes we ordered were rather forgettable.  A personal preference of mine is to use low-sodium soy sauce, which I was told this restaurant doesn't carry.  Bottom line: You can do better for the same (or lower) price."}
{"text":"I love spring sushi for its convenient location and great ambience. I love coming here during spring/summer to sit in their patio during lunch time when it's not so crowded. The service is fast and attentive, though you have to get past the fact that it can get very loud. It's a pretty trendy and chic establishment for an AYCE sushi place.  The food has been consistent. Nothing outstanding or innovative on their menu, but it does have all your basics and the latest popular things like torched/pressed sushi.  Make a reservation because the lines get very long during night time."}
{"text":"Woo buffet is dead. Good bye plates and tables with pubic hair. Spring sushi has arisen in its place. The iPad ordering system is a novelty although our iPad was really buggy. The service staff are friendly and hardworking although the place suffers from the same problem most ayce sushi places struggle with: what you order isn't away delivered to your table. Or items you've not ordered are delivered to your table.  The place gets super busy on weekends and seems to be popular with the under 30 set. I was the oldest person in the place. The sushi seems to suffer as they get busier. The sashimi gets cut smaller and thinner, the food delivery becomes more unpredictable.   The décor is nice. And the window side tables offer nice views."}
{"text":"Ambiance is lacking but if you stick to the Japanese courses, you will enjoy it. Service is very on the ball, great staff, friendly and  efficient. Great for low carb regime. Thai curry and Satay...yuck!!! Everything else was decent!!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. Friendly service. Usually gets a weekend lunch crowd.  Come here if on a budget and have an appetite and get the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Spring Sushi is a fantastic sushi place if you're looking for not just great food but ALSO an impressive view, easy ordering and have a little extra $$ to splurge on a dinner.   I made a reservation here for a Saturday at 7:30pm for a birthday dinner. The reservation was through opentable, which was quick and easy. They had no problems accommodating a party of 9 with a little bit of notice, although we didn't get a window seat because of our group size.   It's a BIT expensive here, dinner came to $36 (plus tip) per person, so make sure you come with an empty belly. The ipad ordering system is quick and easy and has LOTS of choices. Be careful to note which items on the menu are premium and have an extra charge, they're typically listed at the top.   High points on the menu for us included: General Tao chicken, pineapple rice, watermelon and pineapple slush, tiramisu, spicy crispy roll, tempura broccoli and the avocado and cucumber rolls.   The torched rolls LOOKED stunning but left me a touch 'meh' - the top was torched but the rest of the fish was still raw which felt weird heat and texture wise for me.   If you have anyone in your dining party who isn't the biggest fan of traditional sushi, Spring has more than enough sides and other dishes to keep pickier eaters happy. I would definitely take a group here again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the small mall across from the Eaton's Centre where the future shop is on the fourth floor. It was a little confusing to find at first. I like the convenience of how close it is to the Eaton's Centre! Why didn't I know about this place sooner?!  First impressions - the restaurant was crowded, amazing view, décor was really nice, the entrance before the stairs had a club like feel.  We had a reservation and were given a window seat. Beautiful view of Yonge and Dundas Square! I like the iPad ordering system, however it is similar to Kiku in Markham (I wonder if they have the same owner). Drinks are bottomless!!  First the bad - I didn't like the Vegas roll. The cream cheese didn't mix well with the sushi. And the diced beef with garlic tasted disgusting and I think it was microwaved. That's pretty much it though.   Now onto the good, the sashimi tasted pretty good, not the freshest I've ever had but they definitely care about how it's plated. Everything was plated nicely. The beef short ribs were amazing, the shrimp tempura was big and tasty, the green dragon roll was perfectly cut and tasted so good.  Service was amazing because of their iPad system. The iPad system allows for you to call for the server. One thing I found a little odd was that the server had to come to the table to send the order through. (At Kiku, with the same system, the customer can do this themselves) but maybe they've had problems in the past. The great thing about calling your server with the system is you don't have to wave your hands out, trying to flag down your server like at a baseball game or a football game trying to get the attention of a guy selling beers.   A plus was their bathrooms are kept clean!  Overall, there was nothing that blew me out of the water but it was a pretty good experience at an excellent location.   I will be returning whenever I'm downtown.  4/5!"}
{"text":"Bit into a piece of broken plastic (initially looked like glass, but seems to be hard plastic), staff was apologetic but wasn't able to determine how that ended up in the food. Otherwise great food for AYCE (would have given it 4 stars if not for the plastic). Just chew carefully"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant! Always went to the Hamilton location and now live in Toronto and the food and service is equally as good. Food almost always comes very fast and the iPad menu is much more convenient than other all you can eat sushi places with paper menus."}
{"text":"After convocation at UofT, my family and me ventured towards to the bustling city of Toronto. Eager for some delicious food to eat, we decided upon Spring Sushi, an upscale AYCE Japanese restaurant.   Arriving in our nicely tailored suits, we quickly received our table. The decor is infused with Japanese culture, and modern day technology. On the walls are paintings of art. The lights are modernized with neon   A waitress handed out an Ipad (used to order food items on the menu).  As I perused the menu, searching for items that would satisfy my hunger, I noticed the limited variety of dishes. The menu consisted of sushi, grilled items, and noodle soup (and fried noodle).  The grilled meats were a disappointment. The beef was tough, and stone rock. Every bite I struggled to bite and swallow the tiny piece.  The maki and sashimi tasted fresh. Each roll was nicely wrapped. Despite my praise, the sushi isn't innovating or mind blowing.   The Pad Thai was freshly cooked. The ingredients taste fresh. The noodles were nicely cooked.  Alas, Spring Sushi is a disappointment, The menu lacks in variety, the grilled meats were tough but the Pad Thai was great. If hunger besets your mind, venture here for a quick bite. But do not expect high quality sushi or fine dining."}
{"text":"New sushi place? Yep. I love the overall design of the place, once you get to the 4th floor of the AMC complex that it's in, you have to go up a few more steps until you reach it. The eating area was nicely designed. Comfortable seating (omg sofas!!!), the iPad menu was very different but quite innovative as it eliminates the use of paper and the waiter writing down what you ordered. The food came very very fast which is good.   Staff are very friendly and helpful, occasionally checking up on you to see if you need anything else. If you don't finished your order, do not worry about getting charged extra, ask for them to pack the rest into takeout boxes and you can take the rest of your food home for an extra $10. Added bonus, all of them speak fluent English unlike the other sushi places you go to that have Chinese dominant speakers.  When I came, the place was quite empty, the overall atmosphere was pleasant, I was more or less focusing on the design they had for the place, which was really cool. This was an awesome sushi place. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What used to be Woo Lounge is now Spring Sushi. I came here with a few friends for dinner one evening. Sushi quality was mediocre -- I can't really say too much about it. It was interesting to see a mix of sushi and thai food.  The winning point of Spring Sushi is the fact that they have iPads. It fixes the whole problem of \"wait, how many pieces do YOU want?\" Instead, just hand your friend the iPad and they can fill it in themselves. However, the UI of the program on the iPad kinda, sorta, sucks.  Otherwise, if you're looking for AYCE sushi with mediocre sushi, but with great service; I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"The food was always great, I love the torched sushi. The service is good, they constantly clear the table. It was my birthday and they brought me birthday cake which was delicious. They sang birthday song for other table that seemingly had birthdays, but just dropped off the cake on my table which made me feel less special, but it's not big deal."}
{"text":"One of my first time having AYCE sushi downtown and this place was disappointing. Service was very bad as they basically never showed up. The food was also really bad. Their sashimi wasn't amazing, but their presentation was nice.   In general, their sushi and sashimi were mediocre, but everything else was pretty bad. They have a really limited dessert menu and the iPad photos looked nothing like the actual dessert.   I've been to other sushi places with iPad's and this one is definitely one that I will not be coming back to."}
{"text":"This place is cool! I tried it with my sister after seeing positive reviews here, and I really appreciated the help from the yelpers! It's super quick, even if it's Saturday, it's really close to the Eaton centre and to the subway station. The food was good, try the sweet potato rolls :) just the udons were not so good. You can order from an ipad so you know what you order. I'm giving 3 stars because the service was ok, I mean.. A bit rude. But especially for the price : it's all you can eat, but we paid 65 $ (+tip) ; I think that's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"- blow torched sushi had a lot of rice and barely any fish - mussels had sand in them - sashimi pieces are of a good size - we ordered beef tataki multiple times in different orders -- sometimes the wrong amount came and sometimes they just never come - server mixed up another tables' order with ours but was quick and nice when fixing it - fast service and above average decor, room is kind of loud - you can get a nice view of Dundas square if you sit near the window - price on a weekday evening was $28.99 per person which is not worth it, especially when Kyoto sushi house is just down the road with slightly better service and cheaper prices"}
{"text":"2017.11.06. Our first day in Toronto. We arrived Toronto International Airport from Calgary Airport around 3 pm. By the time arrived downtown Toronto (Our Final Destination Hotel), It was already 5 pm. We were so hungry. We haven't eaten anything since the morning. After dropped off the suitcase, we began to seek food for our first dinner in Toronto now.  After we left hotel, my boyfriend took me to the Spring Sushi Restaurant, which is located nearby his company. The restaurant has so many locations in downtown Toronto. The one we've been in Yonge Dundas Square. Because of right at the dinner time, there were lots of people in this restaurant. Inside the restaurant is nice and clean. The waitresses and servers all wear the uniform. We had to wait outside for a few minutes, but it was very fast. About 5 -10 minutes waiting, a waitress led us to our table and passed an Ipad to us for food ordering. This is an all you can eat restaurant. The customers have to order their own food via Ipad menu. All the dishes on the digital menu have prices and images, which are very convenience for people to make their choice of the food.  A few minutes after we ordered food on the Ipad, Our orders came out from the kitchen. All food was fresh and well cooked with medium portions. The taste of the food was decent. Comparing with many other all you can eat sushi, this restaurant has a great food quality and very peaceful environment. The servers were nice and friendly. By accident, my boyfriend ordered too many same special rolls. The server helped us to return some of them back to the kitchen. The prices of the food are around average. $28.99 per Adults after 3 pm. In summary, It was a great experience at Spring Sushi. Highly Recommend !"}
{"text":"The best priced sushi place I have been to. They have a menu on ipads which makes it all exciting and modern! The ambience is good nad for $25 dinner - all you can eat sushi.. this place can never go wrong. The mango coconut pudding and the tiramisu are just out of this world. I always stuff myself whenever I go to this place but its worth it!!"}
{"text":"I loved the patio and the overall atmosphere of this place. The servers are also very polite and the food arrives on a timely basis.   Okay but the main reason why you come to a restaurant..the food though, was pretty nasty. Now I'm not a sushi expert or anything but given the price of this place (I didn't get AYCE), you'd expect the sushi to be just a tad bit better than the average, but it really wasn't. Actually, even if I did get AYCE, still not worth it. I got the shrimp tempura which was overly fried and kind of stale. The miso soup was slightly watered down, not to mention it was lukewarm when it arrived at my table. The green dragon roll lacked flavour. The salmon sashimi was mushy, likewise for the tuna sashimi. The barbecue ribs were probably the only redeeming factor of the meal.   Personally I was not a fan and despite the lovely patio, I won't be coming back. The iPad was cool and all, but not enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Food - not great. The sashimi did not taste fresh, particularly the salmon which was cut way too thich for my liking. The cooked foods were generally too salty or lacked flavor completely. If i were to describe the food in one word it would be: mush...  Service - ayce sushi places generally dont have good service and this was no different. They dont wait on you with the same friendliness or comfort of a family resturant. They generally toss the food at you quickly and move on to other customers.   Environment - the location and atomasphere is what earned 2+ stars. We sat by the window and the view was wonderfully looking at thr chaos that is dundas square and eaton center. The location is prime as it picks alot of mall shoppers or movie goers for customers."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi restaurant with a patio option that is also available. The restaurant can comfortably seat many individuals. There are large windows overlooking Yonge and Dundas square with a great view. The ordering is convenient- we ordered on a tablet (all tables have one) and the waiter immediately processed the order. The electronic system created for a restaurant experience that was very efficient. It was 18.99 (+ taxes/ person) for the lunch all you can eat and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Patio (5 stars) - My favourite patio in the city. I go all the time and have never had a bag experience when dinning on the patio. You can't have the all you can menu on the patio so it's not very busy. The view is fabulous, the atmosphere is nice and not over done.  The menu has a good selection and the food is always fresh & fantastic. Plus you can't beat the prices! The service has always been good. Attentive, fast and knowable. In the warmer months this is where I go 70% of the time. I have nothing and to say. If the whole restraint was like the patio it would be 5 stars for the review.   All you can eat (3 stars) - I have done the all you can eat inside a few times and it's ok. It's not horrible or anything & I will most likely do it again. I normally do all you can eat in the colder months because the patio isn't an option. It's loud, crowded and the service isn't has attentive. A few times the servers have brought the wrong food or there will be noodles mixed in with my edamame. Asking for the bill multiple times & having to get the manger in order to pay. Just a little to hectic for me. The food is still great thankfully.  Some other points about the place as a whole.  - THEY HAVE GLUTEN GREE SOY SAUCE! I'm always happy when that's an option. Most of the time the staff will tell me they don't have it but when I tell them they do they bring it over.   -They only take cash & credit. I'm guessing because they have an atm to profit off. Not my favourite.  -Pretty good drink menu too."}
{"text":"i'll be honest i go there mainly because of the tablet, i mean how cool is that?? yeah is it! and actually pretty convenient when you are not at ease with asian food and want to put an image on what you eating.   The food overall is ok and it comes fast. the sushi are pretty decent, i don't really like their meat, tasteless,  the dessert are bad but #teamgreenteaicecream, i still like to finish with a sweet touch after that i eat.  the service is a russian roulette, you can be with one the nicest waiter or be with the most unpleasant one. but the again you dont really have to have contact with them with the tablets.  this place gather a lot of young people it's fun and i recommend to come with your friend is not the best but you got what you want for an AYCE.  Good place to plan a food coma, don't stand up too fast after tho, your stomach will not handle it!  advice: DON'T ORDER RICE FIRST! this stuff with fill you like never!   did i say free cake when its your birthday?...just sayin"}
{"text":"Not really the best to be honest. Came here on easter 420 and it wasnt really that busy. There are alot of girls here for some reason but it wasnt crowded at lunch.  I notice they dont have my favourite original tuna fish.  The sushi wasnt the best. Lots of rice compared to fish so i guess they want you to leave with a belly full of rice. Price wasnt the best but I guess you get an ipad to play with while youre there.....thats about it. nothing special. Id find somewhere else to go for my money especially downtown."}
{"text":"I live in Ottawa but used to live in Toronto for 1.5 years. When I lived here, I would chuckle when I'd see people eat near Dundas Square (tourist trap). I come to Toronto a few times a year but this time, the group of guys I was travelling with told me that they usually go eat sushi in Dundas square. Again, I kind of laughed but went a long with it. Before I give my review of the food, I need to stress that I'm not a food snob. If it's good, I'll eat there. Well, we get to spring sushi and take 4 escalators to get there. We climb another set of stairs and behold, this oasis in the middle of a commercial desert. WHAT A VIEW of downtown. I mean, WOW!  The restaurant was clean and we were seated almost immediately. The moment you get to your table, you have an iPad and you order, and order, and order. Most all you can eat sushi places are decent but you'll eventually get the look of regret 4 hours later ;) The sushi here was fresh, delicious, and above all, perfect for what we wanted. We weren't too crazy with our order but we certainly got to try a lot and each piece that came out was consistently delicious. I now refuse to laugh when I hear people say they're eating in Dundas square. Spring Sushi, take a bow - you're awesome"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy ordering food on IPads because there is a less of a chance for orders to be missed, yet this place somehow missed a third of our orders the first time around.  Staff: They weren't really around for most of the meal, however if you call for someone on the IPad they come quickly. In addition, the food came faster than anywhere else I've been before. Definitely a great option if you are strapped for time but still want sushi. However, as I mentioned above, they missed stuff that we order. In my past experience, place with IPads just send their food off to the kitchen, but this place calls for a server to type who does something on the IPad. So maybe that's how it was missed.  Ambience: We made reservations and seated on a long bench table. I don't understand why bench tables exist in a restaurant. I like being able to lean back. Also there's nowhere to hang your coats and being on a bench things have a greater chance of falling off. They were also playing club music in the background, so it was a little odd to me but whatever.  Food: The food is not bad. Their tempura was pretty good. The sushi is a little haphazardly made (probably due to the speed it comes), so some fell apart once you grabbed them with chopsticks. They have a wide selection in some aspects (they had Thai dishes on their menu), but they were missing others (not a single ramen soup and they only had mango and green tea ice cream).  It was a good AYCE option, but definitely a quantity over quality place."}
{"text":"I got to say, I am a huge fan of that place. I had AYCE sushi here quite a few times and it was always a near perfect experience.   The service is always near perfection as well. You order through iPads and call your servers through it as well if you wish to add foods to your order. Servers are always friendly however, during my last visit, the service was slower than usual. This is why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5.   The restaurant location is great but parking around there is expensive and far from convenient. Great decor and excellent view. Very clean, futuristic look, which I appreciate.   The food is amazing for an AYCE. The rolls are great, sushi and sashimi are always fresh and delicious and the presentation is usually very beautiful for an AYCE. The other dishes are great as well. I personally recommend the seafood pad thai as well as the garlic shrimps.     Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Very good food for the price. Service is usually excellent (sometimes it falters when they are busy but that happens in most places), and of course it is in a very nice location where you can see the city. Everything is ordered off an iPad so you can see what and how many you are ordering. A very well designed place, and I have been many times already. Definitely a nice place to take a date."}
{"text":"Amei, tanto o sabor quanto o modo de atendimento, no rodízio é um tablet que fica na mesa, com o cardápio, com fotos, você seleciona e envia o seu pedido. Preço bem em conta, no almoço é mais barato ainda! Os garçons são meio lentos e com cara de tédio, mas paciência porque a comida é boa!  Não deixe comida demais na mesa caso você peça o rodízio, porque eles realmente cobram o desperdício!"}
{"text":"I always find this location lacking. I don't know what it is. The food is ok, service is subpar, and the atmosphere is always whacky. Maybe it's because it's a popular spot for tourist and students, I'm not sure, but I definitely prefer other locations to this one"}
{"text":"It's my go-to ayce sushi place downtown. I love ordering food from the iPad and that there's a picture for every item - makes it easier especially with groups. The food is good (for ayce) and the servers are good - I like how they work as a team to make things more efficient instead of only serving a specific area.  My only complaint is that they have gone a smidge downhill since when they first opened and they're not great at holding reservations as I had to wait more than half an hour for a table, even though we had a reservation."}
{"text":"I come here every time i'm in Toronto. It is a sushi machine!! For $30cad I can have all the sushi I can eat, and it is good sushi!! The torched selection is my favorite. The wait staff is efficient and I have not met any that were not pleasant to talk to, I go by myself and make a pig of myself privately. Only bummer is that there is not sushi bar to sit at and watch the sushi being made. The lunch and dinner prices are about $12 different in price, and the menu is slightly different. Go for dinner. It keeps the spending in check and the food is really good."}
{"text":"One of my favourite all-you-can-eat dinner menu here, would definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"This location is great - plenty of seating with nice views. Sashimi isn't included on the lunch menu and we were warned about eating the fish and leaving all the rice behind. Apparently their strategy is to fill you with the cheap ingredients - keep in mind that they bring things out bit by bit so you end up having to wait between servings. If you're with a larger group, it can feel more like snacking than eating a meal. Overall the place gives an impression of cleanliness and seems a bit better than some of the other AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"If you want your sushi cravings satisfied you will not be disappointed after dining at Spring Sushi. Not only is their service excellent their food is great as well. They have a loyalty card in which you get 15% off two of your 10 visits the 10th being a free lunch or half price dinner.   The selection they have for dinner and lunch is quite extensive with dinner having many more food options to select like torched sushi etc.  Their torched sushi is so much better than kaka sushi in Markham.   For the price you pay which isn't that high compared to some other AYCE resto's uptown it's a great deal. Mixed with friendly staff and excellent service you can't go wrong.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Spring Sushi is an all you can eat sushi restaurant. You place your orders using the iPad. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was friendly. The restaurant was not too crowded for Saturday lunch.  The food was okay. You can order sushi, Chinese food, Korean dishes. etc. The miso soup was too salty. Most of the sushi dishes were bland and tasteless and look alike. The fried rice dishes were very greasy.  Would we go back? I doubt it. There are many other restaurants in the area that is better."}
{"text":"I tried AYCE lunch menu on Saturday (17.50+tax) and thought it was not good. My first impression was that this place is overcrowded to the point that it lost a lot of the ambience.  Well, I guess I am here for the food anyway, but the food isn't worth coming for either. It is overpriced for what it is. Not much menu items available on the AYCE lunch menu (some rolls only reserved for dinner as is sashimi). All of my nigiri sushi arrived with semi dry yet mushed sushi rice...not fluffy at all...I have been to other AYCE sushi restaurants and have not experienced this.   Also, tried the pad thai with chicken... the chicken they used in this dish was seriously not edible. It had a very nasty chickeny odour like it was stale/old. It was so off putting. It was the same for when I tried their curry chicken skewer...it could turn me vegan. I decided to avoid all of their cooked chicken dishes.  The fried rice dishes never came.  Their ipad ordering system is sort of okay when it works (its the same interface as 168 Sushi Asian buffet) but many of our orders went missing and did not arrive to our table. We had to hail a server to check if our orders were still coming. Our items eventually came to our table, and our server checked up on us to make sure everything was fine. The service from our server was pretty good considering how busy this place is. But I am still not impressed that our orders went missing for a very long time.  Anyway, if you need to come here for a bite, come with your student ID for the 10% discount. Otherwise I would skip this place..."}
{"text":"Spring definitely doesn't have the best sushi ever, but it's not horrible. I do enjoy the AYCE option.   It's very modern inside and you order what you want off of iPads (lol @ our techie world). Plus, the view is saweet.   Some of my favourites include the seaweed salad, spicy tuna rolls and Las Vegas rolls. Nothing I tried was inedible, although, the deep fried scallops tasted scarily similar to a McDonald's fish fillet... lol wtf!"}
{"text":"Ok for dinner and lunch sushi AYCE.  dinner ayce was 26.99 with torched sushi, tataki and more options. I recommend checking their website for full list of food. Surprisingly their salmon in salmon salad was better than salmon sashimi. Overall I didn't really like their sashimi but it's ayce so didn't expect much anyways. Overall food is not bad, their rolls are pretty good considering that it's ayce. Just watch out for deep fried stuff... We ordered shrimp tempura, coconut shrimp, deep fried scallop, and croquet. Scallop and croquet was ok but shrimps were really bad.... And tempura seem like if it was made as a practice.... Way too much tempura batter and was not so crispy."}
{"text":"Went with a friend, loved the service. We were checked up on every 5 minutes. Sushi tasted fresh which is always a good sign. We decided to go because we drove downtown thinking another place was open at the time. Was impressed by quality of service and food."}
{"text":"My two stars is merely for the food as it is quite decent. The service is very slow and nonchalant. I usually order through ritual with my coworkers and they give us an estimate of when to expect the food to be ready. Normally, that is within half an hour and unlike other restaurants, Sushi Spring does not update you or warn you that the service is slower than normal. So when I arrived to pick up my order with my coworkers, we had to wait another 25 minutes (making the total wait time 45 minutes) to get our food."}
{"text":"Bad experience all around. Came here for lunch and had to wait 10 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables in the restaurant.  When we were finally seated, we were seated in a table that was already empty when we arrived.  Service was terrible, they were very disorganized.  Food we didn't order came and food we ordered never arrived.  For the price, $21.49 for lunch, there are much better options out there. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"great place where the food comes soooo amazingly fast.   sometimes though, they miss some things in your order, which kind of sucks. since you don't notice it until a long break when it seems they're done bringing things over. But that's okay because once you notice, you can just send another order WITH THE IPAD!  The IPads are seriously pretty cool.  but other than that I really like coming here if I want a huge load of sashimi and random other goodies :)"}
{"text":"Nope, just no. Not a place worth $30 + tax + tips for AYCE sushi dinner. Don't know how this place made it to the \"Best AYCE list\"; floor was sticky as hell, sushi rice was HOT/WARM, food doesn't even taste good, missed our orders couple times. Extremely disappointed, never coming back."}
{"text":"When I'm downtown and hungry after gym, AYCE sushi always do the trick. Altough nothing is too special, this place is very consistent. You know you can get some good protein and rice coming in and guaranteed full when you leave so I keep coming back. Staff is friendly. One problem about this type of place is you need to keep track of your order. They always tend to forget certain items like beef tataki"}
{"text":"For an All-You-Can-Eat place, Spring Sushi is actually not bad!  While the quality & variety of the sushi here is average, you really shouldn't expect top-notch quality fish and rolls in an AYCE unless you are paying premium dollar. For the $30 they are charging (as of Apr 2018, plus a few dollars extra on weekends/holidays), you can fill your tummy to your heart's desire at the busiest area of downtown Toronto. It is also a bit cheaper than another AYCE sushi place downtown, which I would not name here.  The decor is nice here with a casual yet modern/clean feel. They also have a huge patio overlooking Yonge & Dundas Square, which I am sure will be hugely popular in the summer.   I was pleased with their aburi sushi selection - it does take some prep work to make and it is nice to see that they offer it. While none of the items they offer will blow your mind, I found that it tastes quite decent for a restaurant of this caliber.  Ordering is all done through an iPad, though a server needs to come by to confirm it before it gets sent out which can be a bit time-consuming. Service for my visit on a weeknight was prompt, but I can imagine it can get quite busy here on weekends.  Overall, I would rate this just a bit under 4-stars for offering a good return on value with decent tasting food."}
{"text":"Fun place to be with a great atmosphere and great staff.  Food for the most part was above par.  Hand rolls were fresh and I especially enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp.  All you can eat option was such a bargain.  Where else can you stuff your face for 25 canadian??  Ipad ordering system was very innovative.  Terrace seating looking down at the street was uber cool! I know where I'm going next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Woo but the new name is a bit of an OK for me. They renovated it and the venue is much more non claustrophobic and brighter compared to the old setting. You could see the huge ads and buildings right in front of you. There is also a huge geisha wallpaper which you could stare at while munching your sushi/ salad. One thing people are so excited about this restaurant is their IPAD menu. You get to choose entrees/ appetizers/ drinks with your tablet and the server will just place it in front of you. Our server ( sorry i forgot your name) is very kind and polite but she only refilled our drinks once. The tablet has every entrees' photos so that you get to picture how each meal looks like. The food was OK, but not that satisfying at all. I ordered the salmon sashimi sushi and i found it dry. When i tried picking up the pinkish orange sushi, the rice were falling apart. The rainbow sushi and spicy salmon sushi were better. They gave us generous portions of avocado in the sushies. The takoyaki was soft and warm. I loved it cause the combination of the wasabi and mayonnaise were perfect. The seaweed salad tastes like the common japanese seaweed salad, salty, cold, and sesame in taste. I ordered their spring rolls but i gave it to my sister. She loved it because there was a fair amount of vegetables inside it. I was not amused with the steak with garlic because the flavour was too light. Overall, the garnishes and all other presentation of each entree are perfect but the taste and flavours need improvements. Courtesy and patience from the servers were A+. Spring sushi needs to be more attentive to their customers' orders because some of them are forgotten at all ( i never received my miso soup. I also forgot to follow up because i was so focused on entertaining my guests.)   The restaurant is in the perfect location (downtown core - dundas) but they need to improve their dishes. I'm still sticking to Maison du Japon at Markham but i'll try to come back here if the food court at eatons is really packed."}
{"text":"We walked in for AYCE lunch on an impulse, having never heard of it or read any reviews, and were pleasantly surprised. The eating area is spacious with high ceilings. There is enough room between tables to enjoy some privacy. It was our first electronic ordering experience so we thought it was fun. Our computer worked fine. The food arrived very quickly. Everything was attractively plated. Our 5 year old enjoyed the chicken skewers and deep fried items, while my husband and I chowed down on sushi, maki and other hot items.We thought the beef short ribs were tender and tasty and the house strawberry sauce that comes with the deep fried banana was nicely done. The place is well staffed so someone always took away our empty dishes promptly and refilled our drinks. We received exactly what we ordered which, when you consider the size of the place, the variety on the menu and the busy lunch hour, is no small feat. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"There's more variety compared to the other AYCE places I've been to. Vegas rolls are my favourite. I really like most of there vegetarian foods. Very fresh and tasty. Lots of sushi to choose from and there's a couple I like depending on the type of meat in it. The teriyaki stuff and skewers is good too. Dumplings and spring rolls are okay. Basically everything that isn't sushi isn't that much flavourful as it could be. As for dessert, I get either one of the ice cream flavours with fried banana. So good! Service is very quick. Tip: take the lemon out of your water to get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"To be honest, this is the first time I've been to an AYCE sushi, and the first item I've been to a restaurant which you could order with tablets. It was pretty cool experience tbh.  We ordered slowly, trying a few dishes at a time. Food wait was okay, it was a busy night so we waited around 5 minutes each time we ordered to receive our food. The staff were very friendly, and despite our many orders (making them come over like 7 times to complete the order), they didn't rage or spit in our food or anything. :P Great patience!  The food itself was excellent for us, we pretty much tried almost everything on the menu! Didn't really taste anything \"bad\", probably the worst thing I had was the steak which wasn't that bad but, then again what did I expect ordering steak from a sushi restaurant lol. However in the end, everything was  presented well which I found surprising, as I was expecting the food to be thrown messily on the plates!   One thing I disliked was the washrooms... Yeah, let's just say next time I'm going to wait until we're done eating and just use the one outside. I guess it was just my luck to witness what I saw that day. :  I certainly look forward to the next time I visit, so I can stuff myself into a ball again lol. Reasonable prices, fast and good food, friendly staff, there's not really anything I could nitpick, it being an AYCE and all. Solid place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Spring only has average ratings, this is by far the best sushi place I've been to in Toronto! Fast service, delicious and reasonably priced for the high quality of food you get! I would suggest going at lunch, because they have almost the same things as dinner, but at $20 instead of $30+."}
{"text":"For a pricy place like this, I expect to get at least average experience yet it failed. Food come with limit quantity especially Sashimi. It comes one piece per order when we have two people on the table. How should we divide it? We had to order time after time after time to get desired pieces. It's not about the quality as well. Roll is not tasty at all let alone the low quality grill. The mustard we got at first place was dry,who knows how long did they put here. iPad is not the way to get customers but the food. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Got a stomachache after eating here!   It's a low quality all you can eat. Just that it's at a prime location so attracted a lot of people.   Fish not fresh, sushi didn't taste good, not to expect much from the service."}
{"text":"Spring sushi presents itself as a classic AYCE sushi spot conveniently located in the heart of downtown Toronto.   On top of the usual sashimi and sushi rolls found on all AYCE sushi menus, their menu includes the house \"Torched Series\" which I found were quite delicious to eat. I also ordered a plate of sashimi as an appetizer. Some of the items I enjoyed on their menu include their baked mussels, takoyaki balls, beef ribs, and their melona bars.   The service was quick and friendly. It was an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sister today! We went there at 12 which is right when they open and we were surprised to see that there were already quite a few tables filled with people.  The food was pretty good for AYCE and the service was decent. The sushi wasn't anything special that tasted super good but it wasn't bad. I personally like their grilled foods and the beef wrapped onion was really tasty!  I like how they actually spend time to give their dishes a good presentation because most AYCE places (*ahem kiku ahem*) just throw food onto a plate and serve it. I notice all the little garnishes they add to the plates and it deserves some thumbs up!  Overall pretty good food for an AYCE but there are other better alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"First time visit to a place I've wanted to check out everytime I go see a movie at the Yonge/Dundas AMC. All I have to say is the place was really cool! You are given an iPad to order from at your table, which I felt made the process super easy and efficient. It really seemed to streamline the process. I've visited other AYCE sushi restaurants and at times, getting the wait staff's attention can be challenging, to say the least. The ordering process was made easy by being able to simply submit your order through the iPad which goes straight through to the kitchen and waitstaff.  Sure, at times, the wait times were a bit longer for your food, but the restaurant was packed, and you could see the sushi team working hard behind the bar. Understandably, there is a wait, but it wasn't anything exorbitant by any means! Come on, people... I've read some other reviews, but you're dining at a restaurant where the kitchen is non-stop cranking out food, that is of decent quality.   So in terms of wait time, for the quality of AYCE sushi, it wasn't bad at all. The vibe of the place was cool and fresh, the wait staff nice and the sushi was quite good (for a \"buffet\"). We also enjoyed the option of ordering some korean (although not necessarily authentic - but who goes to a sushi buffet for the authenticity of korean food?!) and some thai dishes. The curry was nice and spicy. Not the best I've had, but again, not bad for this type of restaurant. The variety of the menu was good and ample, and the quality of the sushi itself for a buffet, by far outshined other AYCE resto's I've dined at.  I thought the experience was good, the food was decent, and the atmosphere cool. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in the hood!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi place. It's much more pricier than most AYCE in Toronto but it's sure well worth it. The service is always amazing, the food always piping hot and delicious. Absolutely nothing to complain about.  The restaurant is always clean, every time we are seated, there's never a crumb on the table and they always have the plates and chopsticks ready. The servers are super quick to remove any unwanted dishes as well and top your water off.  My favorite dishes that I love to get is the spicy salmon sushi and spicy salmon maki. Takoyaki (AMAZING), croquettes, their bbq eel is okay. Their tempera shrimps are always good but sometimes I find that there's too much breading.   I love their new drink menu, they have amazing cocktails that start at 5.99 and up. I've tried their island icetea which is delicious but my new fave drink would have to be the Lychee Mojito.  TIP: They do not take debit, make sure you bring credit or cash!  Happy Eating fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Barely worth it for the price, after the novelty of ordering from an iPad wears off.  The hostesses were very courteous and nice as they were showing me to my group since I arrived late. But our waitress was almost nowhere to be seen during the times we needed her to be there. I feel the iPad system hinders the waitstaff from actually doing their jobs, as ours was often left for so long it sent the order through itself without interaction from our waitress.   The food came out quickly, but everything else took way too long.   And for all of that the food was just \"ok it's food, I'll eat it\". I think the best things were the takoyaki, the calamari and the banana shrimp rolls (try it if you're adventurous). But who would order only that for AYCE? They should  make everything just as good as those dishes. The eel on the eel pizza were tasteless, as was the salmon in the rolls. The tuna rolls almost tasted like canned tuna, which was weird.  Not worth the overall price and experience. I think I'd only come back if I was invited by someone else."}
{"text":"Situated right at Yonge and Dundas, it's convenient for anyone downtown that wants to grab some sushi. Other than its location and the convenience of ordering off iPads, nothing else is special about this place.    Although there is a great variety and wide selections of food, it taste pretty bland. The rolls aren't all that great especially when it's stuffed with so much rice. Sashimi doesn't taste fresh either. The dessert selection was also very limited and isn't that great (there was only ice cream, fried banana and sesame balls). Presentation is nice though.   The service was fast and good as our table was always cleared and water refilled. Food also came out really quick which is good for those on lunch break from work/in a rush to eat. Other than that, wouldn't really recommend this place for AYCE."}
{"text":"me and my bf love this place! everything is awesome, food, people, employees, the view, the music. Everything awesome :)"}
{"text":"Revisited this place after two years and I am impressed with their food. They definitely stepped up their food game!  Came here for a surprise birthday dinner for a good friend and I was quite blown away by the items they had to offer! First off, they do offer a birthday special and that is a free slice of cake! If one is not enough, they're willing to double it! They also make it festive by singing you happy birthday too!   So, yes... all orders are still made through an ipad. Have you ever heard of shrimp wrapped with bacon?! These bad boys were delicious and they do not cheap out on the shrimp. They were of a decent size and quite meaty! One thing that really stood out to me was their torched sushi. I was surprised by how tasty they were coming from an ACYE restaurant. I also appreciate the selection they have for their torched sushi. Definitely something that is recommended!!  Their beef tataki was another good item. The thing with beef tataki is that not every place makes it good esp. when it comes to AYCE. However, they nailed it here, BRAVO! The sushi rolls were okay. We ordered the black dragon and spicy salmon rolls and they pretty much taste like any black dragon/spicy salmon you'd get anywhere else. Sashimi wise... it was generous of them tl serve such thick pieces of salmon and butterfish but, not really fresh which is expected for AYCE. As for their cooked/stir-fry meats like the mushroom and steak... mushrooms were full of flavour however, I found that the steak was a bit overcooked. It was tough when bit into. Same goes for the enoki beef, beef was a bit too well-done.   Overall, service was attentive and quick. Once our order was submitted, food arrived almost immediately and our glasses were filled with water quite frequently. This experience was much better than my visit from two years ago."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now. All with reservations. As of Monday I will be contacting their head office.  Each and EVERY time we've been made to wait more than 30 minutes to be seated. Though the food is fantastic their customer service is horrendous. First time our visit was delayed by 45 minutes, I never got involved; 2nd visit, 35 minute then I got involved. Manger made it right AFTER I told her (the manager) I'd be calling head office. 3rd visit was tonight, 25 minutes and I asked to speak with the same manager from last two visits. She refused to speak to me and 32 minutes by the time we were seated. This time we were given free soft drinks. We don't want free stuff. Manage you restaurant properly. We want to be seated on time (5 minutes late is not a problem) 20 minutes is certainly unacceptable.  None of these visits were my choice but I'm not letting this go now."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends, and thought the place was nice! It was at a great location, the servers were nice, and the food was delicious! It all came very fast, and they have a great variety. Liked how we used iPads to order, and they served us the exact portions we ordered."}
{"text":"The worst Ramen I never tried. El peor sitio donde comí en Toronto, comida muy mala y servicio lento."}
{"text":"Located right in the center of Yonge and Dundas square, Spring Sushi is convenient and great for people who consider cucumber rolls as sushi. Like all AYCE sushi places in Toronto, Spring sushi is just as mediocre as everywhere else... the only novelty is you can order your sushi off an Ipad,.. ouuuuu.(FYI, i was being sarcastic)  Sashimi peices are well presented, though some taste like it's been previously thawed.  Sushi pieces were falling apart, usually stuffed with too much rice.  variety is good, thai food available.. which is why most people prefer ayce over a la carte anyway right??  Service is quick cus you need to order yoursel. But other than that, food quality is nothing more than an OK. For 25$ per person before tax and tips, that money could be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Interesting concept AYCE sushi, ramen, Thai dishes and other appetizers all ordered through an iPad. We came here with a party of 20 no reservations we were seated really quickly. Parties of 12 or more are split between 2 tables.   Buffet for $28 gives you all the sushi, handrolls, Sashimi, Thai food, udon and ramen. We placed orders of 10 items at a time and they came out in minutes. Everything from Katsu, tempura, sashimi, and steak dishes came out in minutes. We all really enjoyed the salmon sashimi tasted like butter. I think between 20 people we had over 100 pieces. The steak, galbi and skewers were really good and cooked medium rare. Sushi is really fresh here and the food is flavored really well.   Only complaint about this place is with a great ordering system you would think they wouldn't have issues. Our orders kept getting messed up and we wouldn't get our food. With a lot of waiters our plates still were getting piled up and we kept having to ask them to take our dirty plates. All in all if you like sushi or Asian food in general this an affordable buffet that offers quality and fresh food at a feasible price. You'll definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"All you can eat japanese restaurant. High variety of options to order. They have ipads with pictures to order, which make our life much easier. Price is fair. And the location is amazing. In the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"Nice patio right downtown at Dundas square. They have a novel iPad ordering system to order your food/drinks but it is a bit cumbersome to use (especially on the patio, the screen doesn't compete well against the sun).  The food is OK, not bad by any means, but not worth the higher prices. Service was fine. It is a convenient option if you are planning on hitting up a movie after a meal, but if getting good sushi in a nice environment is your goal I would pass on this location.  Getting seating was difficult as well, they don't have a good seat tacking reservation system. They were accurate in their time estimate but they require you to wait in the restaurant, no SMS or phone call to let you know when you're table is ready. They're in a mall! It would be nice to be able to do some shopping while you wait.  Prices are too high for the quality of food and environment, the value equation doesn't add up to me."}
{"text":"Took my sister here for her 13th birthday, she had a great time, service was very fast and the food was very fresh. Excellent AYCE!"}
{"text":"Spring Sushi   is hit or miss.  Have gone with groups and its always a hit. My recommendation buffet  and we always order the items that are only available during dinner  and sashimi.   When ordering go easy on the rolls , but dont avoid them either since sushi is all about the rolls and the sashimi . Try items you have not had before. If you are not adventurous it just ruins the experience for adventurous foodies  in the group.  Our servers  have been very helpful when showing us how to use the i pad. Another plus point  here is the window seats that overlook the square . I always request the window seat when dining here. Will be back and do remember to make a reservation  and Print  a copy to bring with you so that you get your spot quickly.  Great experiences are always planned and if you are strategic in   the process from  reserving to ordering you will have a nice seat, great food with your friends and a  great experience at Spring Sushi ."}
{"text":"Service was so slow! It took forever to receive my order and each plate took 15-20mins to bring to the table. The dishes that were suppose to be warm were cold. The quality was whatever there was nothing amazing or generally good about each dish.  Plus a couple dishes I ordered never made it to the table.   Won't be eating here again, disappointed and I'd discourage anyone from eating here."}
{"text":"the price is a little high but I love their sushi, also there is another sushi place, located in the same floor with Jack Astro restaurant in Dundas square. That's good as well."}
{"text":"Bad service, I call for one hour before for 10 people reservation, they said just walk in , when we get there , they told me wifi not working today , need wait for 10 more mins for order food , we wait for more then 20 mins , I try to talk to waiter , can we order and send order out ? He so rude and loudly said :\"I see \" , food just ok , when we paid , they charge extra 13% services on bills, we also paid extra tips on , I didn't paid attention when I was paid ,. Never come back again !"}
{"text":"Food is salty & buttery.  Everything kind of tasted the same.  The sushi was good though.  I love the way you order the AYCE on the iPads.  Great setup!  But food NOT so great.  And price is higher than others, while food quality is worse.  I won't be back.   Also, they are cash only (no debit or credit cards) which is a MAJOR hassle."}
{"text":"Lots of cooked meat on the menu for a carnivore such as myself! Beef wrapped enoki mushrooms are awesome"}
{"text":"After a lot of iffy reviews, my partner and I decided to try this place out. When going for all you can eat sushi, I don't necessarily expect the best quality in the world. The sushi was very nicely assembled, there was a very very big selection of not just sushi, but other familiar Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes.   The atmosphere was clean and trendy, if not a little loud. Between a happy hour beer and the sushi, I felt I got well over my money's worth."}
{"text":"This place sucks but unfortunately it's your closest ayce option near Eaton's Center. I'd suggest making the trek and walking to Aji Sai instead!  Spring Sushi is overpriced, coupled with mediocre sushi, and poor and slow service. There's empty tables all around but you can still expect to wait half hour to be seated. Their other offerings like rice or udon or any soups is extremely salty and doesn't really boast any true taste at all.   If you're looking to really delect in some true sushi, this isn't the place. You'd only go to Spring Sushi if you're too tired from shopping across the street. I would give them props for a clean location, spacious seating, and if you care about it, an iPad ordering system.    If I were you, I'd just spring away from Spring Sushi."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 Interesting and nice looking spot We decided to do the buffet which allowed us to order a variety food using an iPad ordering system, essentially you select the food you want to your cart on the iPad and it is then brought over to your table They have a nice assortment of Thai, Japanese and Chinese food items to choose from. I got to try the negamaki, raw beef, sushi pieces, rolls, pad Thai, fried rice, ice cream and a bunch of other things Everything was fresh and good, not the best quality I have ever had, but wasn't expecting an upscale experience to begin with.  Overall good food, good service and the iPad ordering does at a level of uniqueness to the place that I have yet to see elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE sushi places that are of a fair price are pretty hard to come by outside of Toronto. Even more rare is the iPad ordering that these guys have. I think it helps with keeping their operations efficient as a waiter/waitress only needs to approve your order after you've selected what you want. There are also other items aside from the sushi (grilled/teppanyaki items, miso soup, tempura, appetizers). The service is pretty quick as you get served pretty quickly after you order.   This place might be a little pricier due to its location, but overall I had a great experience.  17.99 Fri/Sat/Sun lunch. (16.99 on the weekdays).  90 minute time limit."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn't say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi."}
{"text":"Spring Sushi is my go-to place for AYCE sushi at lunch time.   The food comes out very quickly and has always been as fresh as can be when I've visited. The service is fantastic and I have always had servers that were very attentive, professional and kind.   Their sashimi slices are very thick and very tasty.  The only downside for me is that the two special rolls that I really liked here are only on the dinner menu which I find is way too expensive for only minor changes on the dinner menu vs the lunch menu. There isn't much other than those two rolls that I would order so it's not worth the extra money to go for dinner. (Banana Shrimp Roll, mmmmmmmm!!!)  Ordering off of the iPad is great and everything includes a photo so that you can see what you're getting. Try to order little by little though, as every roll and order comes on its own plate and your table can become full very quickly with minimal food.  Some of my favourite things to order:  Miso Soup Avocado & Cucumber Hand Roll Red Dragon Roll  Tempura Shrimp Roll Spicy Salmon Roll Avocado Roll Jumbo Shrimp Tempura Deep Fried Spring Roll B.B.Q Beef Rib Chicken Fried Rice Sweet and Sour Pork Deep Fried Cheese Wonton  Try the deep fried banana for desert! The raspberry sauce that comes with it is delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today for lunch with some friends and I thought it was kind of expensive. However, the waiters and waitresses are very nice people. But the food on the other hand was okay.... Some of the sashimi (and other fish products) on the sushi was not cold the way it should've been, and some of the orders we placed on the ipad was not given to us until we asked them about it. The actually restaurant itself was very clean and had a very friendly environment."}
{"text":"It was the worst AYCE sushi that I have ever been to. The sushi's were overly sized. The amount of rice used for each sushi or roll was too much making it extremely hard to eat and swallow. The quality of the rice was really bad. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Love the concept of the place and the all you can eat ipad buffet that includes sushi, soups, apps, noodles and a ton of other options. I wish there was more special sushi rolls though. Thumbs up to the fast service, would def be back!"}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi... order via Tablet.   Now... this place is definitely about volume.  Get folks in, get them fed, and get them out.   This is a pretty large restaurant, and you order everything via Tablet computer, which is very cool and was new for me.  I literally have to roll myself out of the door every time I come here.    This place is great for business lunches where everyone just pays the same price and you can completely pig out.  Neat that everyone can take turns ordering off of the tablet.  Service is fairly friendly, but they really are all about the speed.   I would not take a date to this restaurant, but I would come with work friends or buddies when we are in need of massive amounts of sustenance.   I will be back.  Don't expect the personal touch at this location if that is what you are looking for.  This is like a big box hardware store... but, sushi."}
