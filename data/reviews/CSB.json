{"text":"Best Bar Ever! I go to CSB any chance I get! Best service I've ever had in my life :) The food is to die for. Fried chicken is more then finger licking good!! The grilled cheese OH MY GAWD better them my mother's when I was a kid! And the cocktails.. I cant even find the words to explain how amazing they are!! At first I didn't know what to choose, then Mike (bartender) asked me a few questions and he created multiple cocktails throughout the night all of them different and delightful! The atmosphere is beautiful and the music is always on point best djs on the weekends that I've ever heard and Sundays band  bring the house down! I can't wait to go back!! Actually I think I'll be there this Sunday! ! YEA!!"}
{"text":"The owner of this bar was arrested for drugging and sexually assaulting a patron. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Went there for Mothers Day Brunch. Chef Lucas worked his magic once again. I was there with family and extended family and we ordered some of everything on the Moms Day fixed menu and shared it. OMG, Absolutely yummy: blueberry waffles and bacon, Croque Madam, and egg white frittata Florentine (sp.???). I sure hope they duplicate thIs on Fathers Day. BTW, best b√©chamel sauce EVER!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with an amazing menu! We ordered a variety of things from the menu and loved everything, especially the fried chicken. Told the bartender to surprise me with a cool cocktail and I ended up having 4 of them! Great vibe, great staff, great location! Would come back again!"}
{"text":"WOW! What an incredible transformation from what used to be a tired spot in need of a facelift in every sense of the word. The owner and staff have done an AMAZING JOB of re-injecting a cool hip vibe any night you show up. Staff are friendly, bartenders are skillful and make customers feel special - they know their cocktails that's for sure! The food is much improved and house made which is a really nice touch. Great job CSB, you're doing it right!"}
{"text":"I've had some good times at College Street Bar, but from now on, I think I'll be steering clear of it...

\"A few days ago at College Street Bar, an establishment located in the College and Manning neighborhood, Gavin MacMillan owner and Carasco Enzo Dejesus an employee, gave a 24-year-old woman illegal drugs and alcohol inside the bar.
She was forcibly confined in the bar and sexually assaulted. Both are charged with forcible confinement and sexual assault according to Police.\""}
{"text":"A nice small bar with a great atmosphere. 

I didn't have the chance to grab any food, but I did try their signature \"College Street Car\" cocktail. (Ingredients: rum, cointreau, cinnamon, lemon juice, and egg whites!) The drink is served with toasted cinnamon on top and the extra egg white-lemon juice mixture on the side. It's not out of this world or anything, but it is nice to sip on, plus any preparation that involves fire is A+ in my book.

Great service,
Pretty good DJ,
Cool space."}
{"text":"OMG! Please please don't go there. All there food are over price and doesn't worth it! More importantly I've been diarrhea since yesterday after I ate there!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh god, don't even know where to start.  Me and two friends happened upon this place for a few drinks.  The owner was there drunk and going on about his 'mixologists'. We were shocked at how unhygienic the bartender was.. Long scraggly beard with hairs falling out of it into the drinks and garnishes.  Not to mention he kept pulling on it and touching it while making our drinks.  Gross! Also, the owner was drunk and inappropriate with my male guest.  Both owner and bartender were super rude; drinks needed ice cubes (which we were told we couldn't have any) and the appetizer we had tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp for two hours.  Avoid this place like the plague!!!! (Probably won't be a problem as I predict it will be closed within a couple months)"}
{"text":"Every time I go to College Street Bar I have such a blast! The drinks are amazing, the food's delicious and they have the friendliest, most talented staff of any bar I've been to. 10/10 would go again! :D"}
{"text":"came here on a friday night for someones birthday. it was also a halloween themed night because it was oct 30th! shout out to the guy in the mr. incredible costume that dragged me to the dancefloor against my will. i mean is it really a complete halloween weekend unless u get kidnapped by someone in costume???

i didnt get any food and tbh didnt even think they offered any lmao. anyways I LOVE THIS PLACE. even though we came at 11 there was still a few tables empty to sit at-a few stools at the bar as well. the crowd was really lively and there was a small dancefloor that formed at the back of the bar near the dj booth. the dj that night was so good! it was hard to stop dancing-played a good mix of hip hop and top 40. it emptied out pretty fast when it came closer to last call but we didnt care we were having our own fun. 

the drinks were a tad pricey for a bar on college but overall i liked it here."}
