{"text":"Love this place! The food is awesome, they have great specials, and they have a mega touch, pool table, darts, a jukebox and more. It's a fun little neighborhood bar and they always give good service! :)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh corner bar done right. Good beers on drafts, affordably priced.
Good food specials as well. Two dollar cheese burgers on Tuesday is what drew me in. Pool table in the back, clean bathrooms.

Minus one star for the parking situation, it's a little confusing."}
{"text":"When I am visiting my friend who lives in the area I tend to come to this bar. For a neighborhood spot...food is great! Last time I visited, it was a Tuesday special $2 burgers and $2 captains. The regular burgers are big and filling. The ones on the special for Tuesday are not as big (but that's already the assumption I had coming in) but are really good for a $2 burger. Same size patty you would get at Wendy's. I would recommend this bar if you are in the area, or even if your not. They have a pretty full menus."}
{"text":"I pass this place every time I go to a Pens game and I've been wanting to stop. After looking them up on yelp and seeing everyone raving about these $2 cheeseburgers, then I really had to stop! My husband and I stopped in around 6 for dinner while on our way to Pens game. The building is a two story building, but I was surprised to see how small it was inside! There is no dining room, just a bar and some high top tables that seat 4. I was a little shocked, because the building is huge and the menu is pretty large. 
Anyways, we were instantly greeted by the bartender. I didn't catch her name, but she was SO nice! On Tuesdays, captain & cokes, Coronas, and cheeseburgers are all $2.25 each. Literally my three favorite things ever!! The captains were nicely poured, the Coronas were regular sized bottles (not pony bottles) and these cheeseburgers were a nice size as well! For 2 bucks, I was expecting sliders- but nope! We both ordered cheeseburgers. I got a slide of coleslaw (didn't love it) and a piece of cornbread that was so moist and sweet. My husband got the gravy cheese fries and he loved them so much, he didn't even offer to share! 
I docked a star because I wish there was a dining room and also the parking situation is confusing. But if you love the dive bar scene and good food, def check out Pittsburgerz!"}
{"text":"The worst food ever!!!!! My whole chicken wings where about the size of a pigeon leg they where so small!! And they advertise the best wings in town?? I think the need to rethink that a lot!! They where so over cooked that there was no meat on the bone ! $5.00 for 4 tiny wings really?? Then got provolone wedgies that where do greasy and u hot 3 for $9.00 what a rip off! The frys where so under cooked , then the bartender was making excuses after excuses for the food I mean come on .  Then some guy comes over to me drunk and says she's a good girl she means well I said who? He says the owner of this place is my daughter .... well enough said!!! Then they only take$6.00 off our bill really that's it ! Well enough said!. Never will go back lost my business"}
{"text":"Pittsburgerz is your run of the mill dive-ish bar with some things that make it a little unique. First, we went on $2 cheeseburger night, because WHY NOT?? The burgers are on kaiser roll buns that are toasted to perfection. The patties are a little small for the bun but not small by any other means. For an extra $0.50 you can add lettuce and tomato. Overall, it was probably the best burger I've ever had for $2. I'd ask for \"medium\" tho- I wasn't asked and it was very well done. 
We also got \"zucchini planks\" as an appetizer after I asked what their most popular appetizer was. This was served with marinara and \"gold sauce\" which I think was garlic butter. There was a little confusion about whether this was actually the gold sauce or not...but it was of that color and tasty.
One star lost for the parking. Who knows where you are even supposed to park at this place? A lot of that is the building position, but painting some lines for guidance would be helpful.
One star loss for bathroom condition. This is a newly renovated, family owned place. The bathrooms are really neat, but when I was there it was...we will say in poor condition. It's a pet peeve of mine when details like this are missed, especially when it was not busy at all at this time.
All in all, it was a good experience. A smaller but better selection of draft beers than most places like this, room for improvement, but I'd come back."}
{"text":"A delightful dive experience.  I loved my food and would certainly return. Tastey cold craft beers to wash down a really good burger on a soft, fresh bun.  Huge basket of real fries on the side.  Couldn't believe it when I hit half price burger night on a Mon.  I was initially worried as I approached the door and there was a thick cloud of cigarette smoke, but once I was inside the facility was smoke free. After my meal when I left, I again exited through a cloud of smoke.  This time the perpetrator was actively puffing away right at the main door.  Perhaps a designated smoking section away from the entryway would be useful.  Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"So we originally had plans to go to Alexions in Carnegie but the sign on the door said closed for Labor Day weekend... this place was right around the corner so we thought we would give it a chance... cute place... great burgers and wings!  My son had chicken and waffle sandwich and loved it... got a rib sampler... very meaty and good... both burgers were homemade and very tasty!   Who has happy hour on Saturday night?  They do! $2 domestics- ice cold!  Service was excellent.. we will be back!"}
