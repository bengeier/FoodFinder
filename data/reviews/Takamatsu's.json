{"text":"Great atmosphere & authentic Korean style food.  Haven't tried the sushi yet, but the Korean BBQ is awesome!  5 stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've only ever had the Daeji-Bulgogi; but it's so damn delicious, I don't want anything else!! Mmmmmmmm! Don't be fooled by the exterior!! It's clean, professional and always great service!"}
{"text":"First time to Takamatsu's and I was satisfied.   With such a limited selection of korean bbq in the valley, even more so in the west side, Takamatsu's does a pretty good job. I had their spicy pork bulgogi and it definitley hit the spot. Spicy enough to leave a burning tingle on your lips, but not so much that you don't want to eat anymore. Sides were ok, bean sprouts were my favorite out of the 4 they served today.   The staff is very nice, but the location looks a bit on the shady side, although it's right next to the airforce base.  Place is small with a sports bar in the middle. Wouldn't recommend this place for large parties, but it's cozy.  Give Takamatsu a shot."}
{"text":"I just went back and had the Kal Bi (marinated flanken style beef ribs) bento lunch box.  It was very good, so I'm upgrading my rating to four stars."}
{"text":"My wife use to work there, they don't wash their hands, they use expired sauces from a FEW years back and treat their staff like animals, the food tastes good but if you get a stomach ache after, you know why. Here's a tip, don't eat the salad"}
{"text":"Very average, but convenient Korean/sushi place. i am usually skeptical about the authenticity of restaurants that combine regional foods. This place is ok. Their bulgogi is very flavorful, but a little greasy. You get a TON of it which is good for tomorrow's lunch. It's also nice that it comes with soup. Salmon teriyaki, also decent but didn't wow me, nicely looked but not over cooked. Sushi is very standard but not unfresh like some places. Service is average, although they do split the checks up, awesome if you go with a group.   Recommended for fast, hearty Asian lunch."}
{"text":"The only thing that is ok here is the bulgogi.  I'm half-Korean and nothing here impressed me.  The sushi is not good at all.  The rice is gummy and the fish has no real flavor.  I heard so many people from Luke AFB saying this place was awesome, but I wouldn't try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic, the real Korean deal.  Spoken from someone who lived in Korea for a year, this places bulgoki is epic!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and am usually very pleased with everything about it. I had the opportunity to stop in again yesterday to get a take out order and noticed as I walked in the \"Help Wanted\" sign. I was greeted immediately and was given a menu to order off of. It was after I ordered that I noticed the problem. I sat at the bar for the next 30 minutes waiting for my order to be brought to me. I was given the bill and no one returned to take the payment until a different waitress brought me my food. I looked around the place and for being lunch time they weren't too bad. 3 of the 8 tables were being used. I am at loss as to why the chefs were unable to produce the food in a timely manner. I would recommend that if you are planning to do a \"to go order\" to call it in a head of time.   I will say though that the food was as good as I remembered. I had the great pleasure of living in Okinawa and have been to Japan several times and this does indeed remind me of the authentic Japanese food from when I was there. Just wish they could serve it sooner."}
{"text":"Takamatsu serves the best spicy bulgogi outside Korea- and I have been to Korea twice!!!  This place is a hit with the Luke AFB personnel and I have been a customer since they opened several years ago.  Sometimes they get real busy around lunch time so don't freak out.  Waiting for good food is worth it!  It's also has a nice atmosphere with a bar and flat screen tv's.  Friendly staff and always great Korean, Japanese, and sushi for us oriental food lovers!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this place, At first I was afraid to go there because of its location (stuffed between a couple run down stores) not the best looking on the outside, But my husband went for lunch one day and was raving about it so I had to go. We ordered the Bulgogi to share which come on a bed of onions with bowls of rice on the side and a couple california rolls, our check usually is in the $40 range with just soda to drink. also you get a bowl of miso soup after you arrive which is delicious! Ive also tried the \"fried tofu\" which is an app. and thats ehhh not bad but not a whole lot of flavor to it. there is another one that I love,cant think of the name but its pretty much chicken on a stick over a bed of cabbage with a wonderful sauce which is also an app. I would have given this place 5 stars but im cheap and I like a cheap meal! If you havent gone already you need to go :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant since I moved here from Okinawa, Japan. Really missed eating Japanese food and was so glad it's close to the base and where I live. I wasn't too crazy of the salads that came with some of the meals but everything I've ordered so far was delicious. Not only were the Japanese dishes good, but so were the Korean dishes. Sometimes I'd order to go for lunch and bring it back to my office, to which my coworker's would react \"Takamatsu's again?!\" I think I know what I'll be having for lunch tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"It was the best Asian restaurant I have ever tasted in a very long time.  I'm native Arizonan and always loved Asian restaurants.  I ordered a lunch entree - chicken.  I like trying new things.  Service good.  It had very small portions (maybe a few tablespoons) of different vegetables on the side.  I was afraid to try lymchee (I hope I spelled that right) because it looks very spicy, it wasn't.  Delish!  There were other delicious vegetables, too.  It had 3 sushi rolls too, also very good.  The chicken was grilled and served over cabbage.  M-m-m-m, good!  Served with sticky rice, excellent..  Price, just right!  By the way, it's on Dunlap and 43rd Ave crossstreet."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck! Not the highest quality sushi you'll get, but large portions and reasonable prices. The Korean fare is acceptable, but the selection is limited."}
{"text":"The outside is a little suspect but don't let that fool you. Inside, the dining area is small but very nice with a full bar and nice booths. Our waitress was very attentive and the food was fantastic... this is my new go-to spot for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food, be careful the place looks bad from the outside (but its in a safe area and on Luke Air Force base)  Place is very, very nice inside! and has the best sushi in Arizona."}
{"text":"So, you're new to town and you are in a really sketchy area and you see what appears to be a bar and you go inside for a quick drink.  Inside, there are stereotypically middle American types:  men with cowboy or baseball hats; there's country music playing in the background; there are some hot chicks walking around, but most of the women are as overweight and roughly dressed as their male companions.  You might  feel uncomfortable, especially with the guys, who look like they're with a motorcycle gang, with their bellies hanging over their belts and looking like they can tear you in half for not knowing the difference between a Harley Davidson and a Tonka.  You look at the bar, where everyone's belting down whiskey and bottled beer and instead of nuts or pretzels in the bowls in front of them, you see plates of ... sushi?!?  That's what Takamatsu's reminds me of.  It's a bar, that's not a bar (not open on Sundays and closing way too early during the week to be a \"real\" bar for anyone); and it's a restaurant that somehow found its way into a bar.  If you have any doubt this is REALLY a bar (or once was), you need only look at the dark colored interior with aptly placed soft lighting and lack of windows.  This is THE bar you remember from the middle of Nowheresville, where people came on a Saturday night to get drunk and get lucky.  But wait!  You can't have a cowboy bar without snacks ... so they attached a sushi bar and hired someone to serve Korean food with your Heineken and Jack Daniels.  Frankly, had Kim il Jong walked out of the bathroom (complete with advertisements inside for Ju Jitsu classes), I wouldn't have batted an eye:  it would have seemed completely normal.  I'm not inclined to say, that the dark colors and poor lighting actually induce an atmosphere of happy dining.  While the service is good and the food decent, I almost expected to hear the sound of slaves from the kitchen preparing rice and soup for the miners no doubt toiling behind the restaurant and guards in solid green uniforms with red armbands strolling into the place to let us know our meal was over and it was time to get back to work.  For those of you familiar with the Wendy's Soviet fashion show commercial of the 80s, the atmosphere was sorta liked that  (if you don't know the commercial, look it up on YouTube!).    The food itself tasted good; but the portions were far from large and the traditional appetizer plates they give you with Korean food skimpy.  Service was excellent, so I can't fault that.  But honestly, for the prices, there are better in the Valley ... and you can actually see what you're eating in most of them.  Sorry"}
{"text":"Seems like this sushi man almost give up the this restaurant business. fish,presantation,garnish,flavor,balance,menu composition...I can't feel any his effort."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!"}
{"text":"The beef bulgogi  is very good. Loved the ginger salad and daikon. We came in the evening and it was very slow so we had amazing service but I can imagine during the work week during lunch it would be crazy busy since its next to the base."}
{"text":"I come here often, I suppose that's a good endorsement all by itself.  I've only ever come here for lunch so I'm going to have to keep everything based on the lunch menu.  Always get a bento style box, I used to get the salmon teriyaki which was good.  These days I've been getting the spicy chicken bulgoki which is also good.  As for pricing, again lunch menu only review but 10$ pre tip if you're drinking water isn't bad at all.  Is it high brow?  No, not especially but they are consistent and the food has always been good.  Can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"I am starting to not trust yelp on others rating. My husband and I tried this place in hopes of finding our Yoshi (a sushi chef in CA). But no such luck. This place served frozen fish that was very noticeably not fresh with try to disguise it with spicy mayo sauce. The search continues."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. My sodas tasted  gross to carbonated or something. The sushi was decent for the price, the Korean food is great."}
{"text":"Drove all the way out here to eat lunch to find a sign that says \"Closed Indefinitely beginning August 15th\"."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, the outside and the area will fool you but it is just outside of an Air Force base."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back and try their sushi.    I did enjoy the dish I ordered (see pictures) and it was my first attempt of korean food outside of BBQ.  The Kimchee was spicy but I still want more.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I let her know it was my first time trying real korean food and helped me figure out what i would like best and tips on how to set up my plate.  So I had a beer, some soup, some dinner and watched football.  Too bad I was too full to order dessert."}
{"text":"We have lunch and dinner there and we have enjoyed it almost every time.  We have had two instances where we were truly unhappy with the food.  Once they forgot about us and we left with to go boxes of cold food.  The service has always been given with happy faces and good atitudes.  Over all it's a good place to eat!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, maybe because they only had one waitress for the whole restaurant. While the prices were not bad, the serving siseos left a lot to be desired.  The water and all sodas tasted like plastic tubes and was undrinkable.  All the food from the spicy pork to the be bim bop was overlooked. The automatic 18% tip for a family with four kids was exorpent, especially when you realize how bad the service was.  We did not try the sushi, so no comment regarding that part of the menu."}
{"text":"Honestly I was thrilled to find a place that had bulgogi, I read the reviews and they were outstanding!! So I called in and placed my order for pick up and wasn't told how much it was going to be which is fine.. I got there and there was nobody in the entire place... but I had a really pleasant and funny conversation with the woman who I picked my food up from. We spoke about how I knew how to make Korean food and how excited I was to try this and find a place within a mile of my house none the less! My order was 27 dollars which was kind of shocking for one person for dinner... but alright i was already there... I got home and it didn't look like anything I had ever seen before... it was just meat... no onions, no carrots, nothing just a HUGE thing of meat and then I had the rice.. and it was extremely dry. I like the juice that it has for my rice.. I took one bite and said nope.. so I put it in a pan and put onions in it and soy sauce with oyster sauce and dab of sesame seed oil and carrots and tried to spruce it up a little bit.. but it just wasn't working.. a waste of a big hunk of meat..I ended up eating my nice $27 rice. I may give them another try because the reviews are just so darn good but I was so incredibly sad and disappointed.. and not to mention hungry  and really craving bulgogi.. when you get that craving it doesn't go away!!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi experience ever. Left a tip out of pity for the one poor woman they had running the entire place. Last I checked the words for what I saw are \"slave driving\".   We ordered 2 basic sushi rolls and sashimi. We got our food about 50 minutes after we ordered. Once we finally got it, we found  that our sashimi was still frozen and bloody (definitely not cleaned properly). The rolls had zero structural integrity and fell apart the second we touched them, making it nearly impossible to eat. We would have had more success with a shovel."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Japanese Korean restaurants I've been to since living in those countries. Thank God there's finally good Korean in the far west valley!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 today, Saturday.  There was not one car outside and we thought it was closed.  We sat in the car deliberating.  My husband said that we should try it and if we didn't like the looks when we got inside, we could leave.  I am so glad that we stayed.  First, the place is spotless.  We were greeted immediately.  Yes, we were the only ones there, but the waitress was sweet and helpful.  My husband ordered iced tea which was very good and fresh brewed.  We asked questions of the menu and they were pleasantly answered.  After we ordered, we were brought steaming bowls of miso soup that was very good.  My husband ordered the shrimp tempura.  It was a huge plate.  There were some onion rings and sweet potatoes in the tempura batter.  The batter was very light and not overly done.  His came with a salad (very fresh and crispy) and rice.  I ordered a meal that came in a stone bowl and was sizzling throughout my meal.  I know that rice was on the bottom (that got crunchy, yum, from the hot stone bowl), zucchini, carrots, sprouts, meat, and a fried egg on top.  oh my   delicious!!!!   We also got kimchee, sprouts, zucchini rounds made like the kimchee.  When I asked for a box, I told her how delicious the zucchini was and she brought me a little container to bring home.   Both bathrooms were spotless. My husband said that he found his new favorite place.   I imagine that around lunchtime they are much busier since they are adjacent to Luke AFB."}
{"text":"Bomb.com like all the others. I'm not a fan of the WAYY west side but if your near Luke Air Force Base this is a great lunch/dinner spot. The Bul go ki, beef or pork and all the fixings is awesome and I could eat it all day everyday."}
{"text":"\"Were Back\"  100 mile round trip just to visit this small restaurant ... You Betcha!  This time we met our friend Mike there, solo at the Sushi Bar when we arrived. It's Wednesday and the pace is much slower, but not for Mimi & Kay as they are the only feet on the floor.   We ordered \"Omakasi\" (This means the chef decides)  Mimi paraded plate after plate of fresh Nigiri Sushi, most did not require any additional dipping. Nice! There is no doubt about it, the quality of the fish at this location is giant step above the other Takamatsu's and any of those \"all you can eat\" Sushi joints in town. Pricing is very reasonable.  We also ordered a Kalbi to share, very tasty, as were all the Banchan side dishes. Mimi informed us she works daily and besides running the Sushi Bar she is responsible for kitchen prep and yes she makes the Banchan. \"No time for a boyfriend.\"  Meanwhile Kay kept the Sake Bombers flowing, along with running the bar, tables & the \"to go\" orders. Damn these girls work hard. I noticed a \"servers wanted sign\" on the door. Good luck finding someone who can keep up with this lot.   I love this place, their even open for lunch, I would be in there weekly ... if only we lived closer."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review not based on the food but the customer service.  There is  a short little asian women here that never smiles and  just has a rude personality.  I have been going in this place almost everyday buying sushi in the evening because it's close to Luke AFB and convenient but not any more.  Customer service is a big part of dinning out...I mean really who wants to go to a restaurant that has bad customer service...it's a no brainer...this place has had half way good customer service except when this short little asian women is working who never smiles and just acts grumpy all the time.  Speaking clear understandable english is a must also if your dealing directly with the  public....who wants to go to a place that you can't understand what there saying and on top of that they have rude behavior.  I won't go into detail except to say I've never been treated like that in any restaurant in my life and needless to say I won't be going back to this place ever again.  Another thing I want to mention is one review on here says this place is \"packed 24/7\" is completely false .....I've never seen this place completely packed ever...B.S."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP...where do I begin with this horrible visit?? First, we walked in...a few people were sitting at tables and a few at the bar...there was NO ONE to be found anywhere as far as Takamatsu's employees go. We must have stood at the door waiting to be seated for at least 10 minutes before someone came out of nowhere to seat us.  As far as we saw, there was only ONE waitress.  She sat us and finally came back another 10 minutes later to get our drink order. It took her a little over 5 minutes to bring back 3 waters...she must have had to go out back and pump them out of the wells. That's the only explanation as to why it would take that long.  Another 20 minutes went by before she came back to take our food order. We ordered 2 orders of gyoza, 2 hot stone bowls and a chicken yakiudon bowl for my 3 year old daughter.  The food took 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out they never brought my daughters yakiudon bowl. After about 15 minutes of eating we realized that her bowl wasn't coming out. There was, again, no sign of the waitress anywhere so I had to wait to look for her and then finally flag her down. I asked her where my daughter's food was and if it was even ordered. She just looked at me completely confused. She claimed that yes she put in the order and that it was \"coming out soon\". I saw her run back to the kitchen...most likely because she lied and never put in her order in the first place. I don't understand how someone can assume they're not going to order food for their child and let them sit there and go hungry. My friend and I were finally done with our food another 15-20 minutes later and my daughters food had yet to come out. I had to yet again flag down the non existent waitress and told her we just wanted our check. When she did manage to bring the check she said \"your daughters food is done.\" I let her know not only did I not care but we didn't want it. And I didn't pay for it.  We paid the bill and as we were walking out, as if perfect timing by my daughter, my daughter asked out loud \"mommy, where is my food? Where are we going?\" And I made sure to loudly mention exactly where we were going...somewhere else so I can get her some food finally.  Such a sad excuse for a restaurant. And the food wasn't good at all either. We won't be back and I can only hope you don't waste your time and money there either."}
{"text":"Place is amazing! Parents use to take me there for years and now I'm continuing it on! There spicy pork dish was bomb!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has good sushi and dumplings.The waitresses are nice. Overall a good experience.I recommend this restaurant as a good place for seafood."}
{"text":"Having lived in Korea and Japan twice each I have tried a lot of authentic Korean and Japanese food. I have been to this place twice now to try it and haven't been impressed either time. The food is ok, but does not reflect the authenticity I expected from how they advertise."}
{"text":"The BEST Bimbimbap I ever had. Kim was our server and my husband and I frequented Takamatsu's (right outside the Luke Air Force Base main gate) nearly every Friday night for two years, until we moved away from that part of town.   The sushi was amazing, we became like family with chef and the staff and engaged with many many friends for an evening of sake bombers and sushi lasting until they closed. The restaurant is small, maybe holding 30 people, but it is always clean, always fresh, and always happy to have you visit.   We knew this locations, as it had been many restaurants prior to it becoming Takamatsu. However, Takamatsu has sustained itself over the many many years and we are happy to see a mom and pop place thrive.   Their Bulgogi is really tasty, along with their konkatsu chicken and monkey brains. Trust me on the monkey brains, they are so good. AND NO, they aren't real monkey brains. It is jalapeños stuffed with spicy crab, and friend in tempura, then drizzled with spicy mayo. Hope they are around a long long time."}
{"text":"Love the Bulgoki(sp). Wish I actually lived a little closer so I could eat as much as I wanted. Lunch specials are great, but there dinner menu is also very good."}
{"text":"This funny looking little hole in the wall  is in a deserted strip mall directly across from Luke AFB - I pulled into the parking lot feeling skeptical.  However, I walked into this place and was happily, pleasantly surprised by the welcoming staff and the smell of bbq'ing Korean food! YES! The menu offers some of the most popular Japanese favorites as well as a fair amount of Korean comfort dishes.  I had the salmon bento box lunch special, my mom had the spicy pork bento box.  The gyoza were tasty and crispy on the bottom while the accompanying california rolls were alright.  My salmon was quite yummy, but my mom complained that the pork was not spicy at all.  This place has an extensive bar menu and completely stocked bar.  I'll definitely be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very small lil hole in the wall right outside Luke afb.  I always get the beef bulgoki, I don't know how other menu items  compare but the bulgoki is phenomenal!  You get a lot of beef, 2 big scoop of rice, 4 sides...not sure what they are called. They are all veggies but I only eat one and make hubby eat the  rest w/o touching mine. They are really yummy almost pickled carrots?  Seems like I only go for dinner and that portion is about $13. Its poppin' for lunch though with uniforms all over the place.  They offer military discount and always tell me they deducted it, but I'm not so sure.  A must if you like tasty food!"}
{"text":"The first time I went into Takamatsu, I was unable to review it because the sushi chef had LEFT. That certainly did not make a good first impression, but life and emergencies happen so I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. The outside of Takamatsu is not much to look at. If not for generally positive reviews I'd seen, I would have been leery to even try it. The inside is clean, if a bit dark. There was one family inside dining - again, not a great sign at 6 PM.  I make my way to the sushi bar and am cordially greeted quickly by the chef. The server took my drink order and was professional if not overly pleasant. The prices seemed fair across the board except for the sashimi which was quite high. I ordered the salmon skin handroll and the tuna handroll.  After placing my order, I was promptly handed a cucumber and crab salad which was fresh and a pleasant surprise. Right as I pushed aside the salad, miso soup was presented by the server and was hot and delicious. I was impressed by how much you are given even with a small order. The handroll contained an adequate amount of fish, and the taste was very good. It didn't blow me away, but rated fresh and well put-together. One more surprise awaited me after I finished - an apple quarter to cleanse the palate.  I will be back and would not hesitate to bring friends and introduce them to the hole in the wall sushi joint that exceeds expectations. I just hope the sushi chef is there when I do."}
{"text":"After visiting the Wildlife World Zoo & Aquarium we found the nearest Korean restaurant.  We previously had lunch at Takamatsu in Phoenix so we were hoping this location would have the same type of food. Their lunch menu was not as extensive as other location.    Started off with fried calamari, which had good flavor.   We ordered spicy pork and Kalbi bento boxes.  Spicy pork was very tasty.  Kalbi had great flavor; however, a couple of pieces had a little too much fat on it.     Overall good service and good food."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are the best. Ben-to boxes for $7, teriyaki chicken for $5. Not a huge joint and can be pretty crowded during lunch time (next to Luke AFB) so you will see mostly military men and women taking a break from their everyday duties. Dinner prices are a bit more but the portions get bigger. Sushi is OK. I really only come here for the Korean food. Spicy chicken or pork bulgogi is best! They have different bar specials too depending on the day of the week."}
{"text":"It looks like it would be a hole-in-the-wall joint but it was quiet nice inside. Daeji-bulgoki lunch was yum!!! Will come back again when I return to LukeAFB."}
{"text":"I still can't believe this place isn't packed 24/7 - actually, I know why, their signage isn't very good and it's easy to overlook this restaurant.  DON'T!  They have some of the best Korean cuisine I've ever had.  Lunch is quick and easy, and fresh - you can tell care and quality is what this food is all about.    EXTREMELY WELL PACKAGED TAKE OUT FOR LUNCH - most places just dump your meal in a container and send you on your way.  Every time I have taken out from this restaurant the food is packed neatly, organized, and in a way that won't degrade or spill all over the bag/car on the way home/back to the office.  Great prices, great quality, a great meal.  But you really need to get some better signage, you'd be packed 24 hours a day if more people knew your restaurant was there."}
{"text":"Bulgogi was fantastic and the prices were very reasonable. However they had one server for eight tables and she couldn't handle it. Still food quality was enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Dol sot Bibimbap -absolutely delicious, banchan was good as well. Food was five stars; this place is in a small musky tavern (felt like being in a dark cave) next the the AFB so I wouldn't recommend it as a date night. However, it wasn't dirty. The lady who works here on Saturday was super sweet. Funny to me that a little tavern which looks like it's a drinking spot for military actually serves some damn good Korean food. Try it!"}
{"text":"Yummy place! Don't be fooled by the outside of the place. Great service. Excellent food. The kimchi was fresh, the beef and pork were magnificent. They serve all types of drinks and you will be surprised by the amount of food that you receive. I will definitely be back. Hidden diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"I've had Takamatsu's bookmarked since I moved to AZ a couple of months ago. Over the weekend, I finally got to try it out and boy was it an experienced.  We walked in for lunch on Saturday. It was pretty empty. The waitress was really friendly and took our order right away. We had the seaweed salad, spicy beef bulgogi and the pork katsu with two large Sapporo's to wash it down with.   The seaweed salad was fresh and tasty. A pretty good portion size too.  The pork katsu was good. It was a bit bland for my taste though. Another downside to the katsu, I found a plastic cap? in my dish . That was dissatisfying. The waitress said it must've accidentally come off the sauce jar. They apologized and didn't charge me for my liter Sapporo's though, so it wasn't that bad.   The spicy beef bulgogi is probably the best bulgogi I've ever had. It was the beau's dish, so I had to sneak in my bites. It was also a pretty large portion, so it could have been easily been shared.   Despite my plastic cap experience, I'd give Takamatsu another shot just for the bulgogi goodness alone."}
{"text":"For once, the rumors were true! This place has great lunch specials :) My total bill with drink included came to $11.00. I've paid more for 1 roll at other places!  I had the chicken breast teriyaki Bento box special for around $7. That included miso soup, teriyaki chicken, little bit of salad (I didn't need any more), rice, 2 California rolls (they were OK) & 2 other little goodies, maybe wontons. Oddly I can't remember what they were, but I do remember eating them, lol.   If you are more into thigh than breast meat you can get the same thing for $5!   The place was not at all crowded when I was there, but the seating approach was kind of spastic. Some people were greeted when they walked in & asked where they'd like to sit, and then others were not! Once I had my hiney on a chair, service was great. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! I come here at least once a month and its always consistently great. I spent a year in Korea and the bugolgi here is just as great!"}
{"text":"Bento boxes here are the best, the bi bim bap, but not the sushi.  But I will come here again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! The place looks promising, unfortunately the service needs serious attention. The server was not rude, he just needs training. Management has completely left this kid alone. The food is mediocre and I'm being kind, the potential is there, sadly nobody is paying attention."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside scare you, this place is the real deal. Being from out of town we didn't know the neighborhood at all so it was a surprise to pull up to this location. Once inside we were treated like royalty by the waitress, surrounded by military personnel and enjoyed a quiet conversation and a great meal. The Kalbi Ribs were amazing and the Bulgolgi was equal to any that I have had elsewhere. Fresh food and big portions. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best Korean food in the area.  Their Bibbimbap is my favorite dish to order.  The staff has always been nice and helpful every time I am in there.  Great place to get authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our top 5 restaurants in Goodyear.... After TWO bad experiences here, we will never be back. The first time I mistakenly placed a pickup order at the Dunlap location. When we went to pick up our (non existent) order at the Litchfield location, a minor argument ensued with a very unhelpful woman who spoke limited English and who even attempted to follow us out to the car after we abandoned the fruitless conversation.   Fast forward to today, we show up for dinner to find a group of two older couples sitting at the bar. They seemed to have finished their meal and were laughing and joking with who I could only guess was the only waitress in the joint. The waitress saw us sitting in the booth (knew we were there) and never came over to pour us water or even give us menus. We sat there for approximately 10 minutes without so much as acknowledgement.   This placed USED to have amazing Daeji Bulgogi (spicy pork), but service has all but disappeared."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food!!!  It has all three things that I'm looking for in a restaurant, cheap, good, and filling.  I ordered a regular bi bim bap (Didn't bother with the stone bowl), and everything about it was perfect.  They provided the perfect amount of vegetables and meat with the perfect amount of rice.  Furthermore, the bowl was huge, and provided dinner as well.  The bulgogi tasted wonderful and everything felt authentic.  Even the side dish vegetables were tasty.  There isn't any potatoes, but that's a small price to pay.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.  I will return to try their japanese katsu as well."}
{"text":"OK I live in Hawaii and ever other restaurant is a Japanese restaurant but it came to coming to Litch Frickin Field Park to find Takamatsu. Great lunch specials, great service and great AC. I had the bulgogi lunch special for a whopping $7 that included salad, soup and a huge portion of bulgogi on rice. My brother had the tempura lunch special which was HUGE for about $7. I don't know how they make any money here. The waitresses are the best and not hard on the eyes."}
{"text":"Takamatsu's may not look like much from the outside, but inside is just fine! The staff is always extremely friendly and competent. They even remember our favorite sushi and drink choices; maybe we go a little too often? :)  Sure, the sushi is more \"American,\" but most places that serve sushi are the same in this regard. However, Takamatsu's sushi is awesome! We took our friend, who was visiting from Japan, here and she said \"This is not sushi, but it's delicious!\"   Their Korean food is also very good, of course! The prices are great, the service is fast and excellent, and the drinks are also strong and tasty. The bonus to all of this is that it isn't usually very busy, so you almost have the place to yourself sometimes.  Awesome place! I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're in the area and looking for a relaxed atmosphere, good food, good sushi, and great customer service."}
{"text":"We're supposed to eat at ground control but they were close for a 3-hour private party, so we decided to eat here since it's close by. We had a great service today, they came a lot time to check on us. The food came out fresh & hot, I almost burn my finger with the sizzling plate. I get to try the spicy bulgogi and i fell in love, I have a new favorite entree now! Kamsahamnida... (polite way to say thank you in Korean)"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, the portions were HUGE.  I thought it tasted okay, I would come back.  I can't say too much else, It's very typical of a sushi place."}
{"text":"Its like i traveled to the 60's when i walked in. Korean food was good but the sushi was like supermarket quality."}
{"text":"I went here about 530 in the evening hoping to get some great food. I was highly disappointed in my experience at this place and will absolutely never go back.  The service was non existant, the place reaked of smoke, and when my food and my wife's food came out it was over cooked and cold.  I've wanted to go here for some time and finally did it, but will never return."}
{"text":"3 stars, I would give them 5 stars how EVER! We pulled up last night (new years eve) and we were greeted by locked doors it was only 7:15. I could see a couple eating at the bar. I called the store on 42ave and they said that the store I'm standing in front of would be open until 9:00 p.m.  I informed them that the store was locked, he said give him 5 minutes and he would call over.  Less then a minute a little asian lady opened the door and said \"sometimes the lock sticks\" (BULLSHIT).  [NEG HITS] 1. Locked doors trying to turn away people on new years so they could party. 2. Like so many other reviews about the Sushi chef going home...he was MIA last night as well.  They said he wasn't feeling well, so he went home. (BULLSHIT)  [POS HITS] I ordered the Bolgolgi (Beef).  I asked for them to make it HOT (SPICY) they spared no peppers for me, it was insanely hot, and I ate ever last bit of it and wanted to lick the plate, but she took it before I could.  The Miso soup was off the chain, i've never had it taste so good before, and they smacked it out of the park. The kimchii was cut to small, couldn't really wrap the kimchii around the rice, so I just ate it out right.  This was my first time hitting this store by the base, I ALWAYS go to the one on 42nd and Dunlap.  I will never go back to this store, I'll stick with the other store. food was great, but they are more interested in the night off."}
{"text":"Got the hot stone bi bim bop and the bugolgi beef. Everything was decent and the service was  good. Went at around 8PM and my husband and I were the only customers."}
{"text":"Bar and restaurant, so it was very dark.  Ribs were tough and fatty. Chicken Terri was ok.  Waitress opened the door so a cold breeze blew on me.  I'll not bo back"}
{"text":"Not the top place in the area, but certainly not the worst, either. I think this is the only place they have Japanese beer on tap. That right there is worth 4 stars, already. Servers are excellent: friendly, courteous and quick. We've been here at least 4 times. The first time we were there, we quickly learned to never order the sukiyaki. But, we greatly enjoyed their nigiri, sashimi and rolls. So, the other times we have been there to eat, we just stuck with the sushi menu and of course, Japanese draft beer. The service was always excellent, no complaints at all. Once we ordered a sushi boat and everything they gave us were very good. I would go back again."}
{"text":"this is our favorite sushi spot in the west valley. great happy hour! and my little sister tells me the quail eggs are delicious (she's braver than i am). i've had most of the sushi rolls (love the marilyn mon-roll), the tempura vegetables, udon noodles, stuffed jalepenos. they also have this amazing drink - the ultimate gin and tonic. it's gin, infused with rose petals and cucumber, and tonic and it's delicious. kid friendly, inexpensive, craving smashing, yummy sushi spot! never too busy, large patio - can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem in Glendale. Love this place, it's a great authentic hole in the wall place to have Korean food. The price is decent. They aren't open on Sunday though.  They close pretty early too, but still it's very delicious! It's our little spot that we like to share when we have company."}
{"text":"Not good - I normally LOVE Korean food, but not this place.  It's super underwhelming, smells vaguely of urine and the waitress was unfriendly.  Meat was ok, everything else was under seasoned, the sushi was awful.  The Takamatsu in Phoenix is WAAY better - save yourself the disappointment and go there instead!"}
{"text":"We went in about a month ago. There was like 2 couples there and we sat at a booth but didn't do the cooking ourselves. My GF and her parents used to frequent the place, but she hasn't been back in a long time. After perusing the menu, I just ordered some sushi and she ordered a large entree and a side entree, I don't even remember what they were and she probably doesn't either. I was disappointed because the sushi has the seaweed on the inside and rice on the outside. I prefer mine the other way, which is why I usually order sushi at the counter, not a table, but whatevs. I didn't think it was all that and I'm pretty sure her nostalgia for the place has waned since our visit. She hasn't mentioned it since."}
{"text":"Food here isn't the same as it was, different cook. Also their menu isn't the same as the Phoenix location. They have a smaller menu yet still good. Their spicy pork and bugogi is good."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good place, definitely a place for the LAFB people to go since it's across the street.  Wasn't a big fan of the beef bulgogi. If you're going to try one thing before you die, their VEGAS ROLL is it. I don't like sushi, fish, or sushi rolls, but this was amazing!! Good food, Great service"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday with my boyfriend for the first time. The reason I gave it three stars is:  A: They had a sign at the door that said no sushi for a week. I understand people need to go on vacations but hence the idea of a japanese sushi bar... sushi. B. So instead of fulfilling my craving for sushi, I resorted to the Teriyaki chicken. I've eaten tons of Teriyaki and having lived in Japan.. this tasted like they soaked it in some shoyu, ginger and maybe a hint of sugar.  I'm definitely not a big fan of this place, but I'm willing to give it another try for their sushi."}
{"text":"Made a point to drive out for Korean, and really glad we did. The Korean dishes were authentic and very well done. Prices were quite reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the Sushi is fresh and amazing!. My husband had the spicy yellowtail roll and I had the Las Vegas roll. Both were very good. Saki bombs. YUM! The beef bulgogi is also very good. Gyoza appetizer is Yummy! Love the decor in this place. Its calming. TV's inside. Nice big bar as you walk in. On my visits the staff was always friendly and service was good.   The only downer is ordering take-out on the phone from this place. (which Ive also done) Just a heads up; You really need to know exactly what you want before ordering and make sure you go over the order with them before heading down there. or better yet, just go in and sit down and eat.. :)"}
{"text":"Tried a couple items off their menu... Started with the seaweed salad which was flavored well. The udon was very yummy with the seafood, not too fishy and the noodles were cooked well, not too soft like I experience at most places.   We also had the Korean BBq which is definitely worth trying but as I recall it was a little pricey for the quantity. Didn't try the Sushi yet, maybe next time. We went on a Wednesday night and were the only ones in the whole restaurant :( It's a nice restaurant but I think its just a little hard to find, located in a poorly lit strip mall (we went at night).   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious place you would never know existed.  Hidden away, but so good!  Had the beef bulgogi...yumm!  Also the heart attack appetizer is amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved it! From the outside it doesn't look very promising but once you get inside it is very nice. Clean and somewhat fancy. It wasn't crowded and the service was great. Really enjoyed the food! It was a unique style of teriyaki food and we loved it. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Service- not great..: it took 10 minutes to get drinks and it took about 20 minutes to get food. The owner who appears to be a little drunk, was over talkative and a bit strange.  His wife was a sweetheart.  I wish we were only dealing with her.   Food.  The side dishes were poor.  It consisted of potatoes reddish yellow radish and Monday being sprouts , all of which were somewhat bland in overall I would call and describe as Americanized The kimchi was actually pretty good however.  We ordered the bib bib pop.  The portion was medium to small, an abundance of lettuce, it also contains some caviare which I found a bit unusual.  I asked the guy for some of the red pepper sauce and he looked at me like I was a space creature.  Yes we are referring to the guy that appeared drunk.  We also ordered the squid stirfry which was surprisingly very well done.  The squid was not the highest quality as it seems like it came from a bag of frozen squid parts versus someone getting a squid in preparing it inappropriately cutting it  If this was the only restaurant in the city I would probably keep going here.  But since there are much better options out there like Takamatsu that's where I will continue to go to from now on.    The restaurant also is a bit dirty has a strange smell"}
{"text":"Real Korean food made by Korean people!!! Note: This review is based solely on the Korean side of the menu and NOT the sushi or Japanese items.  Just need to put a disclaimer out there just in case.  With that: Its Korean food made by Korean people! My 2 comrades ordered bugogi lunch specials and I had dol sot bi bim bap (not listed on the lunch menu) The lunch special were a like Japanese teshoku (lunch boxes) it came with the selected meat, rice, salad and 2 mandoo. They were large enough make my comrades fat and happy.   The bi bim bap was on point with something you would get in The Motherland. The stoneware was über hot thus I was able to make lots of crunchy rice. The best part was they cracked a fresh egg on the rice. My #1 pet peeve when I order bi bim bap is that they fry the egg separately and dump it on the rice. Thank goodness this place prepares it how it should be. Kudos for that! I was a happy Pat with my dish."}
