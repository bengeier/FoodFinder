{"text":"We ordered wings here through uberEATS. Onion rings were burnt. We ordered 1/2 pound of sweet and spicy Thai wings and 1/2 pound of Forty Creek Whiskey wings. They were terrible. Scrawny wings with barely any meat that were completely burnt. Barely any sauce. Immensely disappointing.   When we tried calling the location they took no accountability saying they were unable to help as we ordered through uberEATS. Like they had no clue how to find the order. Even though we could provide them with the time the order was placed, the order number and the ITEMS ordered. I've lodged a complaint with uberEATS as well, but the terrible quality comes from this location. We will never order wings from here again. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The pizza was awful. Tasted like frozen pizza. That's not delivery, that's delissio. Cheddar was kraft singles and the parmesan extra topping was just a plastic container full of dehydrated parmesan. Unacceptable to serve people this and charge more than 4$ a pizza."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews, love the grilled wings and pizza (we like well done and this is the first place to cook well done) lots of toppings has always been hot.  No complaints!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first and hopefully last negative review. Bought a wagjag coupon for a $10 xl pizza with 4 toppings, thought it was a great deal. Couldn't call ahead and pre-order so I had to go there wait and pick it up, no big deal.  When I went in and presented my coupon, the owner said: \"you know I make no money off these things\" and proceeded to rant to me about how I should support local business and throw away the coupon and purchase regular priced items instead. This guilt trip did not work on me and instead I just told him that there was no obligation to promote his business through wagjag, and all I did was want the item I paid wagjag for. End result, definitely shorted me on toppings and quality as a result of the coupon. I'll never give this location business again, totally unreasonable management."}
{"text":"So I've been living in the Yonge and Eglinton area for about two years now. When I first moved in, I ordered a pizza from Gino's and was extremely disappointed by the quality. I figured maybe they were having an off night, so I didn't write them off completely.  Last night I finally decided to give them another shot, and the quality was just as bad (if not worse).  I ordered a large pie with bacon, sausage, onions, tomato, and mushroom. When I arrived to pick it up, it wasn't ready - which is fine; I'm happy to wait a bit if it means I get a fresh pizza. (I should note that the interior of the store is actually pretty filthy and gross. Don't they ever clean up in there?)  So I get the pizza home and excitedly take the first bite. It's terrible. The cheese and toppings are mediocre at best, but the real issue here is the sauce. Or the lack of sauce, I should say. There's so little on the pizza that it's basically non-existent. (This is the same issue I had the first time I ordered.)  It's hard to imagine something less appealing than a dry pizza. You're basically just eating subpar melted cheese on doughy bread. It hardly even *qualifies* as a pizza. And I'm no pizza snob, either. But this... I'm just at a loss for words. How do you mess something up something so simple to this degree? It really does take a special kind of incompetence."}
{"text":"Pizza was undercooked. Other than that it was very good. Their cheese is very good and they use a lot. I got ham because I like ham slices on pizza but they use little slivers instead, they should use slices.  Chicken wings were terrible. Dry and small. I got some hot and some suicide. Didn't care for the taste."}
{"text":"Just ordered from Wing machine at Yonge and Eglinton.   Just wanted delivery of something not pan-Asian for a change. Sushi'd out. I ordered:  1lb jerk wings $11.95 Blue cheese dip $0.85 Extreme Bacon cheese with fries  $8.45 Orange crush can $1.10  Pros:  -Open till midnight  -Delivery minimum is $12. Doable. -Different sides and additional toppings available (e.g. fries, wedges, onion rings) -Quick delivery (Ordered at 9:55. Arrived at 10:15)  Cons:  -The foooood. It's really blah. For lack of a worse word to describe blahness.  Nothing extreme about that burger except my disappointment- the blue cheese\" was not the crumble you might expect but the same runny sauce used as a dip.   The wings were so hot they were rendered tasteless. Nothing jerk about them except the chefs pretending to know a thing about jerk seasoning.  Only my can of pop didn't fail me.  More cons:  -$3 delivery fee. Muuur. -Charge for the yucky dips, one should be included with wings -No deals. No 3-drinks for leas or any kind of deal to drive sales. This place could use a repricing strategy.  I RECOMMEND- a&w burger or something   EXTRA TIP- As ordered on just-eat.ca"}
