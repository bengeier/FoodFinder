{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Toronto!! I'm from Vancouver so I'm used to cheap and tasty sushi and this place is right up there. Dinner for 2 for $18.99 is an awesome deal and the spicy salmon roll is out of this world. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Picked up sushi from New Concept last night.  I've picked up 3 times in total and each time, sushi is fresh and fast.  Service is great and prices are reasonable.  They have a great dinner for two, for dine-in, that's priced at $18.95."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi restaurant for your buck. The staff is super friendly and nice. The sushi always excellent and fresh. And honestly the price you pay is well below average for this neighbourhood in TO. We've been going to New Concept since we moved to this area 4 years ago. I've never been disappointed. Only the decor needs a serious redo."}
{"text":"We go to New Concept frequently, both for lunch and dinner.  We have a mixture of vegetarians and omnivores in our family and we are alway happy when we leave.  The prices here are REALLY reasonable, usually our family of 4 walks out full at a tab of $40. I would get the bento box dinner, which has good tempura (they give you some shrimp), some sushi rolls, tasty miso soup, salad, rice and whatever selection of protein (I usually have the chicken). That is under $10 and it's a lot of food.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the decor is SO boring. White walls and no art. If they bought a few cans of paint and did something on the walls it would be great.  I\"m not calling this a high-end place. It is just basic japanese but good value for money."}
{"text":"I have been going to New Concept Sushi for over a year. I love their spicy tuna hand rolls and their yam rolls are pretty good too. I'm from Vancouver where sushi is generally awesome and cheap. Not so here in Toronto; but at least they're somewhat reasonable, plus the service is very friendly. I just found out that they deliver.  Enjoy."}
