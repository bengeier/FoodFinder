{"text":"The food is really good here, the gluten free pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto this last weekend and I was lucky to have found a restaurant called Big Mamma's Boy. I live in Chicago who is known for its Pizza.  However, I have to say that the pizza at this restaurant is the best I have ever tasted.,and I have travelled extensively.   The decor is very unique and artsy.It is a very cozy and romantic place to bring a date. The service is excellent and the owners are a delight and very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with a dairy/gluten free eating person and had an outstanding dinner.  Prices were reasonable, giant menu with lots of choices for those annoying eaters out there - even what I chose ended up being without gluten and dairy.   It was a mashed potato and baked chicken breast (Rowe farms, none the less) which had a chickpea batter and a mushroom gravy. Total comfort food.   The space upstairs was also comfortable - but when you make your reservation call and ask for the bay window table - enjoy your meal while watching the derelicts of Parliment.   They made brunch sound pretty great - so will have to venture out again for that.   They have a large selection of pizzas, but aren't always able to accommodate gluten free for these apparently.  A good restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place - great decor, with a vibrant atmosphere and decent menu with lots of gluten-free options. Amazing pizza choices, whereas the entrées could stand a little more diversity.  Three of us shared the antipasto plate and it was more than enough, and quite delicious--of note was one particular type of cheese with a horseradish-flavour. Quite good!  Had the smothered chicken, which was quite tasty, with mashed potatoes and a green salad that had a little too much dressing but all in all a wonderful meal.  Our server was a bit standoffish and cold, not friendly at all, but he got the job done."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely front and back patio.  The pizza is DY-NO-MITE.  We had the Cabbagetown pizza, with sausage, garlic, basil, onions and mushrooms.  We also created our own pizza with sausage, beef, garlic, bacon and some tasty cheese. We loved our pizzas...lots of fresh toppings, perfectly cooked, and the right level of doughy-ness and crunchiness.  They also deliver...so that is wicked!  I'll definitely be back to try their much-raved-about brunch, and the delicious dinner menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Mamma's Boy three times now and for those of us who need to be g-free, this remains a great brunch place. No matter when you go, do NOT go in a hurry. Service here just might beat the record for being the slowest in town, and if the servers are feeling stressed they aren't above passing that stress on to you.  That said, I've never had a meal I didn't like here. The gluten free pizza is great, and it's nice to have a brunch with tasty gluten free options beyond asking for eggs benny without the muffin (and hoping they don't forget). So, I'll give the place an A- for the food and a D for the service. Just stay patient and it's a nice enough place."}
{"text":"This place is now called Caroline's!!!  Formerly known as Big Mama`s Boy, this has relaunched under the helm of it`s new owner and chief proprietor Caroline Murphy.  Same location, phone number and web address.  Hopefully, all the links they have available on their site will reflect the changes.   I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It`s charming and inviting with personable customer service to boot. Now, how is the food you ask?    For all you fine folks suffering from celiac disease and are on the hunt for having a gluten free dining experience - come here!  It will make you feel like you are just like everyone else.  You wanna know something? It`s such a simple thing but a great thing.  Here, you are not sacraficing flavour.  Almost the entire menu, I believe, with the exception of the spring rolls is gluten free.  I must say, I had the best pancakes!  I usually don`t like pancakes because they tend to be too heavy for  me to finish but these were light and flavourful - and yes, gluten free (go figure, eh?).  I would love to come back here and try their dinner menu which includes pizzas that have been rated the best in 2010!  Reasonably priced and plenty of choices. Check out their website for more information.  http://www.facebook.com/homewithCaro    or http://www.bigmammasboy.ca/index.html"}
{"text":"Their dinner is also amazing, and their patio is awesome-- really cozy. We had gluten free garlic bread (not amazing but still an indulgence) gluten free lasagna (awesome on a cool summer night), and gluten free pulled pork sandwiches. Then took a walk around beautiful Cabbagetown ."}
{"text":"I have been twice and made the mistake of ordering pizza each time because the rest of the short menu of homestyle options seems fairly uninspired despite the lure of ethically- and locally-sourced meats and veggies. (\"Catch of the day\" on this recent Thursday was pasta with marinara sauce and shrimp.) I should've saved my money and just got a slice from a certain ubiquitous pizza chain up the street. Big Mamma's Boy's crust is thick but not chewy enough, the tomato sauce is bland, and the toppings are meagre -- what little sausage I had tasted neither \"hot\" nor \"Italian\".  They specialize in gluten-free options here, which ought to have been exciting for my wife, who has celiac disease, but she too was disappointed. The first visit she had the ribs and they were just ho-hum. The most recent visit she ordered the burger which was scandalously tiny for the price and was served on some sad-looking sliced bread that was obviously from a packaged loaf. It came with a side of potato chips -- I guess fries are too complicated for this kitchen -- but she couldn't eat them because they were sour cream and onion flavour even though we told the waitress no dairy.  They have an overpriced wine list to match their overpriced food. There's also a poor selection of beer including one gluten-free option, La Messagère, priced as if it really were from France like it says on the menu. It's from Quebec though, and while I'd normally overlook such a silly mistake, it reflects the generally low attention to detail.  I can't imagine coming back here."}
{"text":"After the Yelp event at Laide, I wandered up this way to get some dinner to go with those delicious martinis - and Big Mamma's Boy was it!  We had the pulled pork sandwiches and a pizza with artichoke hearts, grilled chicken, sundried tomatos and goat cheese.  The good: - it was a very entertaining experience - pitchers of beer are called 'jugs' - they are open late  The bad: - everything else... the Food was pretty bad... - the Pizza crust was flavourless, the toppings were dry and didn't seem fresh, the pulled pork was actually okay.  The weird-and-scary: The woman who was running the show here... I swear to God that she asked me for money on Church one night, and I gave her $5 because it was raining.  Then she offered to walk me to the streetcar stop, which she did, while talking to me/herself about some conspiracy, and then suddenly... she was GONE, having disappeared into a dark parking lot/alley of some sorts.  I swear that it was her working here and I think she recognized me.   Will I go here again? No.  Just... No.  Well... maybe for psychic brunch."}
{"text":"THE MENU:  An almost exclusive gluten-free menu is not the only aspect that differentiates Big Mamma's Boy.  They also support local farmers by featuring naturally raised or organic meats, vegetables, and dairy as much as possible.  I've been searching for locavore and/or organic restaurants in Toronto and they are few and far between.   Big Mamma's is a one-shop stop offering the above PLUS gluten-free and dairy-free options for the diet restricted.  Although, the name might lead you to believe otherwise.     The menu includes a few appetizers ranging from $5 to $15.  The gluten-free mac & cheese was tempting (if you really like it you can go for the entree size.  Other mains offered include vegetarian and beef burgers (naturally raised of course) among other dishes, all priced between $13 to $25.  Then comes the pizza - the draw for us.  Big Mamma highlights 8 of their own creations but also gives you the flexibility to design your own.   A 6 slice signature pizza will run you $20.  If you opt for gluten-free crust, be prepared to fork out another $4.   THE ORDER:  We decided to go with 2 varieties of pizza and another Italian staple, lasagna.  Both pizzas were medium (6 decent sized slices) since they can't accommodate anything larger with gluten-free crust.  Not sure why that is.    Big Mamma Pizza ($20) -  I'll forgo the ranking out of 10 on this one. Read on to understand why.  Description read \"topped with grilled chicken, goat's cheese, pesto, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes\".   I wish I could say this pizza was everything I had hoped for and worth every single penny.   I hate to be the buzz killer but the reverse is more accurate.  The crust was rock hard likely because it was overcooked - burnt edges gave it away.  I had a similar experience with Pizza Pizza's gluten-free crust so it wasn't a complete surprise.   To my parents on the other hand, this was blasphemy!  My father was the first to try it.  He patiently and politely struggled his way through his first (and last) slice.  When he topped it with the lasagna I knew there was a problem.  I took a bite and was surprised my dad's teeth were still in tact.   Let's assume the crust was edible.  I still would have been a bit disappointed (just a bit).   I was anxious to try the pesto but as you can tell from the photo, there's not a spec of green on the pizza.  I'll chalk this up to a miscommunication on my end with all the modifications.   I tried to ignore the dense crust between my teeth to enjoy the flavours - I think this would have been tasty and deserves another try.  All that said, Big Mamma does deserve some credit.   I informed them that the pizza was inedible and given their response, this was a common occurrence.  They immediately offered us a complimentary pizza on our next order, no questions asked.  The manager encouraged us to ask for a slightly under-done crust in the future.  I recommend you do this as well.  The result is more pleasant...  Our own pizza creation ($20) -  Much better.  A 7 out of 10.  We went with my parent's suggestions which was tomato, mushroom, broccoli and anchovies on gluten-free crust (my only contribution).   Most people cringe at the sight and sound of anchovies (same reaction we had to brussels sprouts as kids).  Truth is, the saltiness is a desirable addition to pizza.  Try it.  The thin crust was topped with lots of sauce which I prefer.  This combination means that eating the pizza out of your hand held is a messy ordeal.  It's a little softer (some might say 'soggy') and is meant to be eaten with a fork and knife.  Given that the first pizza (with limited cheese) was a no go I 'had to' steal a few slices of this one douced with mozzarella.   I was kicking myself afterwards when I noticed rice milk mozzarella was an option.   Vegetarian Lasagna ($16) -  Gets a 6 out of 10.  This was the first gluten-free lasagna I'd come across in Toronto.  I was prepared to fall off the 'dairy-free' wagon to try it.  When the delivery arrived it took me a few seconds to decipher what I was staring at.  The photo captures the moment for you.  In fairness, it was probably shifting around in the back of the delivery guy's car.  I'm sure it is better presented at the restaurant.  Anyhow, taste is what really matters.   If you like cheese and sauce, you'd enjoy this.  My nonna (Italian grandma) would hit me with a wooden spoon for saying this, but the sauce reminded me of her sugo pomodoro (homemade tomato sauce).   Personally, I expected a bigger portion being from \"Big Mamma's\" and would have liked to see a few more veggies."}
{"text":"Little did I know when I set foot in Big Mamma's Boy for brunch this morning that not only would the place be packed for Pride Weekend, but that it was also the day of their monthly \"Psychic Brunch\". For $40 you get a psychic reading (tarot, fortune telling, etc.), brunch and a goody bag.   Throughout brunch I kept glancing over at this one table where a man was seated alone and kept accepting a new woman across the table from him every five minutes, occasionally holding her hand. My brother and I honestly thought it was speed dating or something (turns out it was a psychic). At other random tables throughout the restaurant there were tarot cards being shuffled and dealt and people looking deeply into one another's eyes and predicting the future.   Owner Heather is very friendly and always present, shimmying her way from the first to the second floor and also the back patio and essentially running the show. Everything they serve is organic, wholesome, modifiable and can be made gluten-free. As I've mentioned before this is a \"substitution\" diner's dream come true as they welcome requests to accommodate allergies and sensitivities.   Veggie Eggs Benedict ($10) was, as always, delicious and the hollandaise was creamy and thick, but not overly decadent. You don't feel like you're eating butter and egg yolks (what hollandaise is, in case you preferred not to know) on top of poached eggs here. It's got its own kick and it's very lemony and savoury. The wilted spinach is julienned and carefully arranged on the whole wheat english muffin that cradles the eggs, and it's served with a small potato pancake/hash brown of sorts that's topped with goat's milk yogurt.   Our German-accented server Kristine (I will take the liberty of assuming it's with a K and not a C as all Germans know the letter K is clearly superior -- ahem, Kat) was pleasant and accommodating, refilling our coffees and teas at a steady pace and checking in on us often.  NOTE: They are now only open for brunch on the last Sunday of each month. They're going to be focusing on hashing out kickass dinners instead, and I'm eager to sample them as I've only ever been for their brunch!"}
