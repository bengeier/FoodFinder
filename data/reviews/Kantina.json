{"text":"Delicious kosher food, reasonably priced, great service, in a simple & clean little cafe! LOVE IT! Thanks for a lovely birthday lunch,  Nathan!"}
{"text":"Finally, a nice place to get a good burger in Cleveland that's affordable. Close to Cleveland Heights and for those of us at the hospitals (UH, CCF) or Case a good lunch option. They will cater lunches etc.. Casual atmosphere, the menu is simple but good. The burgers are the way to go.. fresh and handmade, pulled beef was great and the bread fresh, my kids loved the lentil chili. All in all delicious. Table service was a bit challenged (probably better to do take out/ call in advance) but we have to give them time to sort things out.   I hope they last we need a good, clean, affordable  Kosher Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our family's absolute favorite place to grab a delicious burger. The food is fresh and delicious, the casual atmosphere is fun and friendly. We love the french fries, the fresh bread is amazing, and the salads are unique and innovative. Kantina is one of the only restaurants that satisfies everyone's specific tastes, even our vegetarian. It's a great spot and so convenient, right here on the Case campus :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. The burgers are amazing and i did a catering event with my office.  The service was awesome and the place is clean and inviting.  Can't wait to go back to kantina! Ask for Seth. The desserts and shakes are to die for!   They have a full on line Catering menu which is upscale and first class. Sheva brachas are amazing and they did my Kiddush too!    Burger chicken steak and salad by day and upscale Catering. Wow."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the greeter and waiter friendly. The BBQ beef sandwich came with coleslaw, fries and pickles. The beef and onion soup is hot and reminiscent of cholent. I would eat here every week if I lived in Cleveland. While, regretfully, I did not order it, a wiser patron than I got a burger topped with a fried egg. Looked so tempting, I might return to Cleveland just to try it."}
{"text":"Ate here for Sunday brunch. Food was DELICIOUS. They had a great selection. Had shakshuka for the first time and it was amazing.   I will say it was hard to find, we didn't really pay attention that it was a part of the Hillel. We also were expecting a restaurant type atmosphere and it appeared more like a cafeteria. Also, there wasn't a baby changing table in the bathroom, they did not have high chairs and no cups for kids.   It was clean and KOSHER which was awesome. Will definitely be coming back for brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dinner!  The restaurant was clean and well lit. Our server was extremely friendly and had a great personality.  I ordered the hummus platter and a vanilla shake. It was delicious. The falafel was fantastic! The shake was dairy free because its a kosher place. WINNING!!!  AWESOME!! I'd highly recommend this place for anyone who loves to eat."}
{"text":"Service slow.  Portion size was fine, but the order took so long to prepare that the crisp ff that were ordered came out cold.  I got the combo pulled bbq beef and hamburger.the bbq beer was ok but the burger was tasteless lacking any attempt at flavor."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a delicious burger restaurant for a long time. Having lived on the East Coast for a few years and eaten at tons of burger places I have to say that Kantina is great!  The Kantina burger was delicious and so was the soup of the day. The HAND MADE burger came with pulled beef on top of the meat and that was DELICIOUS. The meat was seasoned really well and burger assembly was spot on. The bread was super tasty and fresh. The service was good and the staff was friendly. The food came out in a timely fashion and the items are priced appropriately.   We're super excited that Kantina has chosen to make Cleveland her home!"}
{"text":"I just catered my second event from Kantina for my Office party.  Wow it was fabulous.  We only had a few kosher guests but the party of fifty couldn't have been more pleased.  Seth is a pleasure to work with and very accommodating to any needs.  His team is delightful and happy to help.  The food was great and they made me look like a fantastic host.   I barely had to do a thing !!!  Thank you Seth.  You and your team rock! And we will definitely keep you as our corporate caterer!! Jon Klineman Middleburg Heights Family Dentistry 440-888-6784"}
{"text":"Loving this place! Fresh bread is definitely a great way to separate yourselves from other Cleveland restaurants *mic drop*. Time to step up your game Cleveland restaurants - Kantina is on the scene."}
{"text":"Kantina is an excellent option if you are looking for a nice place to eat. They have a friendly staff and a good selection of food to choose from. I ordered the falafel sandwich and potato crisps. The falafel was well cooked but not dry although the bread on the sandwich could have been toasted a little bit. The potato crisps looked very nice but they could have benefited from some seasoning. Overall excellent meal and for 6.99 it is competitive with surrounding eateries."}

{"text":"I've heard good things and am so glad that I gave it a try.  When I think of Kantina, I thought it may be cafeteria or take-out style, which was wrong.  You're seated at a table and taken very well care of by a waiter.  We ended up ordering the Chef Salad and the Chimichuri Chicken.  On the side I got the lentil chili which was honestly, AMAZING!  I need to use lentils in my chili -it was phenomenal!  The chicken was juicy and well spiced.  The bread was just right and smeared with a tasty aoili style sauce.  My friend with the salad seemed equally pleased - noting a hint of wasabi and a great flavor profile.  Most meals were under or around $10, which I felt was a good price.  Great service.  Great food.  I'll be back!"}
