{"text":"Was looking to get a smoothie in this area...cute place inside, Columbian music playing..the lady wanted so bad to fix me something..but I couldn't get past her top which had hair, and other particles (that could fall in my drink).  I decided to not get anything.  I'm mad because I wanted to support her, and she has such nice fruits, and veggie to make a nice smoothie."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, Olivia is a darling.  The food is freshly made by Olivia and the ingredients she uses are good."}
{"text":"This coffee shop serves light breakfast and great lunch deals includes a drink and dessert.
We ordered a Cuban and a Spanish sandwich, both came with chips, dessert and a drink of your choice.
The white chocolate cake was heavenly.
The family owned business is so friendly and happy to please their customers.
I will always come back for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while out galavanting for the day. It looks like just a mini mart, but there is a hidden gem of Cuban fast food to go in there. There are 2 sweet ladies that work there and they have been helpful and kind. The slightly older lady reminds me of an aunt who just wants to feed you a home cooked meal when you visit her. The younger lady is always making sure the place is clean and in order, which it always is. There is a speaker by the small dining tables playing Cuban music as well. 

I had a sandwich with a meat filled flaky pastry with olives and tomatoes, pressed between a baguette drizzled with olive oil. What a delight! They have Cuban sandwiches as well and it is made fresh to order. I love the daily agua fresca she makes herself as well. She takes so much pride in her food and what she feeds you that it shows every time. I have had the plum agua fresca and guava one and both were refreshing, not too sweet and tasted like real fruit. As it should be! The prices are incredibly reasonable for the authenticity and quality you're getting.

Overall, this place hits the spot for me when I want a good sandwich with a tasty agua fresca. The place is clean, service is friendly, and prices are great. Lastly, if you're not sure about something you can always ask. The lady there is so patient and never made me felt awkward when I had a question. Will be coming back!"}
