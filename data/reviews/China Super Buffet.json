{"text":"The food was quite good at this buffet.  Veggies were cooked to my liking.  And lots of varities of goodies to feast on."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a good variety of Chinese dishes and a large number of seafood dishes (multiple shrimp dishes, fish, squid, fake lobster dish) was surprised to see pizza and kielbasa on the choices as well. The banner says Lunch is $5.99 on the outside, for the buffet so I decided to try it. 
I have had better buffets and better Chinese food but it was OK. The price I later learned does not include your drink, which I think in all fairness it should. They have a few deserts and soft serve ice cream but I passed on the sweets. My favorite was the fried butterfly shrimp, they were tender, meaty and tasty - had 5 of them. The chow mien was a little greasy but still tasty. Sampled some chicken dish that was also tasty but since nothing is labeled to tell you what it is called it's hard to know. 

Also thought the take out food situation was weird, they give you a Styrofoam clam shell thing, you fill it yourself with whatever and then you pay something like $3.65 a pound for your order. WTF, is with that? I'll pass on that. 

The staff is attentive. The place from what I saw was was clean. There were a few TVs in the place to watch, but one was a little to loud over the others but not to annoying. 

It's an okay buffet, but I have been to better and not paid much more, for better quality and bigger variety with the drink included. Doubt if I'll return with so many Chinese buffets to still choose from."}
{"text":"Service was BAD. I know you shouldn't expect great service at a buffet but is it to much to expect that when your not busy to show us to or seat within 5 minuets of us coming in instead of you watching an afternoon soap? Also would loved to have maybe gotten a refill or at least a few of the used plates moved away. Kept telling us they would get us a drink refill but then never would come back or would just go to the other end of the place and sit down.

Some of the food was alright.I liked the spicy chicken and the \"Kunf fu chicken\" but with service like this I really don't think I'll be back. Thanks...

Also thought it was strange that some dude was selling Porn DVD's in the parking lot on his bike."}
