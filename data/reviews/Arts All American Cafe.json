{"text":"I come here for breakfast! The food is soooo good... always cooked fresh! Today I ordered 1 biscuit & gravy with two eggs, bacon, and hash browns for $7.95 (4/13/17) Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about a great neighborhood restaurant. Friendly down home greetings from the owner and solid plates of great food. Nothing fancy here but it's very easy to feel like a local. Stop on in and sit a spell y'all. Mom and Pop diner/cafe/restaurant at its best."}
{"text":"Asked the nice guy at the Department of Revenue for a lunch recommendation, and he mentioned Art's Cafe.  Told us it was comfort food, clean. and all the DPS officers went there so it has to be good!  So off we trekked to find out for ourselves.
Patricia greeted us as we walked in the door.  She was so friendly and helpful the entire time we were there.  It felt more like we had stopped by her home than a diner.  She answered questions about the menu, made suggestions after listening to what we had to say.  Her suggestions were spot on and quite tasty.  Ordered the salad with the meatloaf special and she offered to let us try the soup as well.  Cream of Potato was pretty good, but  stayed with the salad.  
The bacon cheeseburger was nicely prepared, came with fries and a drink too for $5,99,  My meatloaf was served with a rich brown gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans for $7.99.  These were the daily specials for Tuesday, each day offers something different and I think we will be back to try it again soon.
I didnt eat very much of my meal and Patricia was worried that I didnt like it.  It was very good, I couldnt eat much and the serving size was generous.  It was nice to see her genuine concern that I might not have liked it.  We asked her about the breakfast meals and she let us know that breakfast was served all day.  
Asked her about the biscuits and gravy and she mentioned they also do it with Texas toast.  If I hadnt been so full I would have ordered it then and there.  Just finished my leftovers for dinner and Im even happier with my meatloaf choice.  
Yes we will be back.  Its good, its clean, its got great prices.  Its not fancy and you wont get the anonymous chain restaurant experience.  Thats even better in my book and I cant wait to try something else!"}
{"text":"what an amazing diner, all the comfort food, priced right, fast friendly service, clean restroom, I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"When I first visited this place, my only critique was the amount of time it took for me to get my food. But time after time, they have improved tremendously. I come to this place almost 3 to 4 times a week. Keep on doing your good work!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the outside is gross, there's nothing but transients outside , I kno the area is rough but there should be human Poop on the walls along with the smell of pee. Owners should hire security during business hours to escort these people off the property ."}
{"text":"Before I went to Art's, I used to question if there was a god. I lived a very miserable life with my own negative thoughts as my best friend. I remember that first day all too well. I was hungry so I stopped at Art's All American Cafe and it was then that my life was set on a new path. I looked over the menu and made my pick. I am surprised they didn't use a forklift to bring out my plate it was so huge. I took one mouth watering bite into my Green Chili Beef Omelet with extra cheese and my world suddenly started to spin, the ground shook and I was catapulted out of my seat so far I actually landed on cloud 9. I don't know how to explain the experience it was as if to see fireworks for the first time. After the life altering first bite I was scared to take another my negativity kicked back in and I thought there ain't no way that it could even be fathomable the second bite was going to be as good. So with much anticipation I sunk my teeth into the second bite and again I was lost in the world of avatar. I looked across the table to see that I was dining with the one true king and he had a smile and said ever so softly, you like that huh? I made you come in here Andrew. I wanted to show you that you were wrong for being so miserable and that their is way more to life then the usual negative days where you used to trudge through. I looked at god with a tear in my eye and then back down to my Green Chili Beef Omelet and then I knew now that there was a purpose to my life. My purpose at the moment was to finish my plate and then spread the word of Art's all american good food at a low price with big portions served by very good hearted people. It don't get any better. Arts gave my life knew meaning. I looked back up to say thank you to my lord for allowing me this experience and he was gone. He disappeared into thin air like all my negative thought's. To this day I go in there to dine quit frequently. Art's has become my home away from home and my second family."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Perfect little family cafe.  The prices are low and the food is fantastic!!!!!!!  My dad goes here everyday, sometimes twice a day!  I love this place."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place but it's a mom and pop shop. They have awesome fried fish on Fridays. It is not just a little piece of fish I swear they fry the whole entire fish and give it to you. The tartar sauce is homemade and really good.  The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Greatest fish we've found in Phoenix. We come twice a week for great food and wonderful service. Dotty is such a sweetheart. This had become our regular spot and I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"There's not much else open between 5 and 6 A.M. besides Denny's, IHOP and the 24 hour fast food outlets, but even so, Art's is gaining in my estimation with every visit.  The servings are radically generous and filling.  Forget your dinky little silver dollar pancakes and 8 oz coffee mug, you could see these pancakes from space, and the coffee mug is large enough to do laps in.  

Everything I have had at Art's has been good and of good quantity, if nothing particularly  outstanding.  I have had better than the ham, swiss & mushroom omelet,  but it may have suffered from lack of attention due to time spent trying to photograph my  %$@# food (You've done this to me, Yelp).  The generous 4 moderately thick slices of bacon quite the taste-bud gasm I was anticipating from their mouth-wateringly appealing look or smell, and I'm not much on Cajun toast, but overall it's still a good down home diner breakfast that fills you up, makes you feel good to start your day - and gives a good value for your dining dollar.  The food is \"A-OK\" but I'm mostly a fan of Art's  because of: 

1. Service and friendliness of the morning waitress who says \"Good morning\" as you enter, calls everyone \"Hon\" or similar, as every good diner waitress should do, and who checks on the status of your coffee cup and satisfaction regularly throughout your meal.  Service is fast out of the kitchen too.

2. That extra effort:  I asked our capable morning hostess/server/ cashier if she would convey my request for addition of grits to the menu, as to a Southerner there's no such thing as a proper diner (or breakfast) without grits - or at least the prospect thereof in the offerings.  I ended up coming in at the same ungodly hour the very next morning and was greeted with:  \"Would you like grits?\"  And lo, there were grits. In one day.  And done well.  There should be music.  

Side note: To get to the restroom, you exit the dining area and follow the walk around to the back.  There's a single restroom, with one toilet and sink, as well as a second door which leads to the kitchen. The toilet, counter, sink and floor were all clean  There was no trash on the floor, and it was well-stocked with paper towels, TP, and hand soap.  And you know you're in a working folk's diner when there's a big orange jug of GoJo on the counter across from the lavender hand soap.   

Meanwhile, I look forward to getting back to Art's to try out all those comfort food daily specials on the lunch menu, the meatloaf, the pork chop sandwich, the apple pie, and more, and to adding that 4th star!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great spot for eating in the downtown area. I have lived around here for 15 years and didn't find this great place until I was at the Capitol for redfored. I had a bacon cheeseburger and fries and it was great. The fries really weee super tasty...crinkle cut...crispy outside and yummy inside.  Coworkers had taco salad...loved it...tuna salad...great...and salad and minestrone soup...wonderful. I will be back for breakfast etc on the weekends. Fun and friendly service too."}
{"text":"This is not fancy place, but they have good comfort food and friendly warm service.

We came here for lunch during the #redfored teachers rallies at the Arizona State Capitol, it was very convenient.

They have basic all Americans food and it was good. I had spinach mushroom omelette generously came with some sort of hash brown and toast and it was under $10, loved it!

This place is kind of cute located in the corner of W. Van Buren St and N. 17th Dr. This neighborhood might be not the safest area, but during the day is pretty safe.

Will definitely comeback next time."}
{"text":"Great food and very nice people! Fried fish on Friday's is the best!Great tasting burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Rough neighborhood, lock your doors. Decent food at decent prices. Use side entrance next to the circle K. Location signage needs improved. The breakfast is their main dish, so the hours reflect. Family owned and ran business."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for a while now. There green chili beef amulet is delicious. My family from Texas was out visiting us and they loved it. They want to come out again in June. I have recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing
 The staff is friendly, the food is awesome and the price is great. This small hidden location is great. They make fresh buttermilf biscuits everymorning and i can not say enough about how great the food is !"}
{"text":"This is a really small diner on the corner of 17th Ave & Van Buren.  We went for breakfast about 10am on a weekday and it was not all crowded. However, I suspect it starts to get really busy at lunch since it's within walking distance of many of the state office buildings. 

The menu gives you a diverse choice of comfort foods and really was far more extensive than I expected for the restaurant's size. Signs were posted for the various daily specials and there were quite a few birder choices if you were looking for lunch. Best of all, prices were very reasonable. 

I look forward to going back to try more options."}
