{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  It's gritty and a little cold--but in a good way.  It fits with the industrial glow of the neighborhood which is very up-and-coming and also very old school. This tavern joins the old with the soon to come.  Outside and down the street, there is some pretty wild public art.  I loved it.

Beer offerings were great.  I loved everything I tried.  I highly recommend their  house \"Waterloo Brew\" and one that they bring in from Brooklyn called \"Resin\" (it tastes kind of like Great Lakes' \"Chillwave\") YUM!.  My husband is already trying to get me to bring him back for more cheesesteak.  He says it's the best he has had since we moved here.  I got the hummus--pretty good.  They put the pita bread on the grill to crisp up the edges which was delicious.

Downstairs are some bocce ball courts.  I wasn't aware that there was such a thing as an indoor bocce ball court, but there is.  My husband, my friend, and I had a blast throwing balls around.

Come here with some friends.  Enjoy a few good beers, eat a cheesesteak, and play  some bocce ball in a cool old building with very friendly service"}

{"text":"After having been here twice, once during a soft opening, and once on a weeknight, I feel like we've gotten a pretty good feel for the place. That said, I can't wait to come back! 

It's clear that there's a lot of history in this building and it's wonderful that the owners have held on to that history and culture rather than trying to turn the space into something that it isn't. The bar itself feels like a combo of something between your Eastern European grandma's basement and an old banquet space, which is really great in its own special way. This old school, blue collar/working man's bar vibe is something that fits in this area because of its history and its need for a bar like this. On top of that, the staff is wonderful--owned by the same folks that own both ABC locations and XYZ, you know that they'll pull together a competent and friendly staff.

Now for the food! The sandwiches here are MASSIVE. I had just gotten done with a training run and hadn't eaten much all day when we came here, so I was able to polish off all but a couple of bites of the bbq pulled chicken sandwich. The hunger wasn't the only reason I ate so much, though. The food itself was delicious and I can't wait to give some other items a shot (looking at you, Slovenian Klobasa and Kraut!)."}
{"text":"The neon sign saying \"Cleveland Cheesesteak\" was all I needed to want to go in this place. So me and the husband went in tonight. The music was actually at an appropriate volume, which I have never encountered in a bar my whole life. Anyhow I had the Cleveland Cheesesteak and asked them to hold the mushrooms. My husband had some concoction with Slovenian sausage, sauerkraut, and pulled pork. Draft beers and ciders were $6 straight down the line and each of our sandwiches were between $9-$9.50. Seems kinda steep for a sandwich but it was a BIG SANDWICH. The only thing I would have liked better was if they toasted the bun. But the bread was a good texture, not too crusty but not a hotdog bun like some places give you.  Husband's sandwich came with horseradish on the side, but creamy horseradish would have worked better. Boo hoo. He still loved it. The Cleveland Cheesesteak was brisket- not all greasy and chewy, thank God- with cheese sauce, onions, and something salsa-y on top. NOMS. The service was polite and timely but the employees weren't all up in our shizz. Good munchies. Will return."}
{"text":"A solid dive bar with a very friendly staff and the best TVs to watch a game in the area. I love their beer selection, especially the Neapolitan stout which is hard to find on draft. The jerk chicken was a little dry and I didn't taste the rub much so they just recommended the BBQ sauce which was a tangy goodness. Also gotta love the old school bowling game they have- overall a fun, low key place to drink and watch a game."}
{"text":"First, remember this is a tavern. They also serve food. While the beer offering is great (as it should be!) the food is ok. I Enjoyed my cheesesteak and pale ale. She thought the BBQ sauce was very good but the bread dried out. Remember why you're here and you'll do fine!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid joint. Very Divey, but unique with the bocce ball in the basement and a couple of their own brews which were ok.  Solid beer selection overall, and good pulled meat sandwhiches.  Just the location is the big issue."}
{"text":"Nice place, great beer, food is pretty good, but a little overpriced.  They have a bowling machine, which is fun, a jukebox, and several TVs showing sports.  The bar tender seemed overworked, and didn't really stop to chat much.  I've been here a couple times, and nothing really stands out about this place that draws me back again and again.  The interior is spacious and feels kind of empty, even on a busy friday night.  I'm not sure if the bocce courts are open yet, but if/when they are, I think that will add a lot of interest (I've been to them before this place opened, and they're awesome, clay courts, very unique).  This bar has some good elements, and I'm glad to see new businesses open in the Waterloo area, but IMO they need to do something to liven it up a little.  If you're reading this Alan Glazen (owner), I'm thinking something along the lines of live music, trivia nights, wing nights; you know, neighborhood bar stuff, because that's really what this place is trying to be."}
{"text":"Oh my lord... Could the food have been any worse. Artichoke dip arrived cold, asked for it to be warmed up. Watched the cook microwave it. Served again to me. Generous portion of an awful mess. Dilled toast for dipping were stale, dry and awful. The cheese steak.... Gray, greasy and yucky. The hoagie bun was cold and partially grilled...tough and stale. I saw more of the bartenders back than his face as was playing with an and a knife???   Place smells like a urinal cake. The good news?  The beer was pretty good..."}
{"text":"A wonderful toehold in the neighborhood. The lilliputian kitchen makes simple but delicious sandwiches using smoked meat (or tofu) from a sister restaurant. The taps are somewhat limited but the have some decent craft options. Overall, the place seems to be staying true to its blue collar and Easter European roots but nudging into modernity. The bocce courts are spectacular, and this place gets bonus points from me for the bar bowling. I'm not on this side of town often, but this place will be on my radar whenever I am."}
{"text":"This place is pure, old-school CLEVELAND. Waterloo Brew has managed to bring a brewpub to N. Collinwood in a way that honors, rather than white-washes, the flavor and heritage of the neighborhood.

This is a bar where you can imagine your grandpa drinking a Stroh's with Harvey Pekar after his shift at the GM plant. From the amazing, regulation-size Bocce Court in the basement - to the original 1940's bar fixtures - to the sense of grit: this is a 5 star ambiance. 

The house Beer tastes like a craft brew homage to PBR: delicious! 4 stars!

The house-made sausage and sauerkraut sandwich, though lacking in visual appeal, was tasty and surprisingly not greasy. I'd give the dining experience here 3 stars. Honestly, though, the so-so presentation contributed to the charm for me, and the friendly service made up for some of what was lacking in the food. 

You won't come for the food, though. Come to have a beer from their good-but-not-pretentiously-large beer menu and enjoy a real neighborhood dive bar in the best sense of the term."}
{"text":"We've been on a brewery kick and decided to check out a couple on a recent Saturday night.  Waterloo Brew was our last stop of the night.  

My rating of 3 stars needs to be clarified.  We ordered the Cleveland Cheesesteak sandwich and it was delicious.  It's big enough to share, and make sure you ask for the homemade barbecue sauce to put on top.  5 stars for the grub.

As for the place itself, I give it 2 stars.  The inside is dingy, dark, and has that \"old bar\" smell.  Not my kind of place to hang out.  For a Saturday night, this place was empty.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because they have a bowling machine.

Finally, the beer.  Or lack, thereof.  They only had one of their beers on tap and it's brewed in another location.  Needless to say, we were disappointed by the selection.  At least we had a really good sandwich!"}
