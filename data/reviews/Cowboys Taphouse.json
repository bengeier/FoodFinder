{"text":"Visited recently, to be honest I was not particularly impressed with the food nor the service. 

I understand they recently reopened? Their menu offer a \"power hour\" between 5pm and 6pm, unfortunately none of the staff knew what that consisted of. General questions weren't answered with confidence - more like she was guessing and hoping for the best. So staff definitely needs more training, otherwise somewhat friendly.

The booths are equipped with TVs at eye level which is somewhat distracting and a little annoying to be honest. If you sit 4 at the booths or even 3, the person sitting on the inside has the tv inches away from their head which is some what unpleasant. 
 
We started out with wings, I had bbq chipotle - was disappointed to find out that it meant bbq sauce wings with chipotle seasoning dumped on top. Otherwise, wings were cooked evenly which is a change from other wing spots in Airdrie. 

I followed with their Ruben, tasteless. The topping could have used seasoning. The people that was with me said their food was okay, nothing special. They both had the New York steak. The \"saut√©ed\" onions that covered the steaks were heavily undercooked, seemed more like an afterthought that anything. 

Generally not impressed, but they just opened so hopefully it gets better. The bar side seemed busy and loud."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the food here is priced right and quite good from what I have tried. I've eaten at plenty of places across the province so I have lots to compare to. Judge for yourself and give them a try. Wings are fresh to order unlike other places that re-fry previously cooked wings to speed up production. You may have to wait a bit longer tho because of this. I've been several times since they have reopened and will continue to go back. Give them a chance. You may be impressed."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a menu. 40 minutes for a beer and 1.5 hours for a burger. Lots of excuses. 
Gen manager apologized and took 25 percent off the bill. Which was actually 6.5 percent... not sure how that could have happened?
Was not impressed with the service at all. 
Food was hot and fresh. But not worth it for me to go back."}
{"text":"Went for wings after hearing its great only to be disappointed. The wings were super tiny compared to other places in Airdrie and we ordered poutine to share. It has more gravy and shredded cheese than fries and the gravy had a funky taste to it. That's just the food....the service was also horrible, we waited forever for drinks and forget about refills unless you ask for them. By the time we got refilled we were completely finished (what we ate and didn't throw away) and ready to leave. Will definitely not waste my time going back here again."}
