{"text":"After a couple of awful shawarmas around Toronto, I was off of it for a couple months.  Yesterday, though, I decided I should revisit, and grabbed a falafel sandwich from Pita Q. 

Verdict: so good!

The falafel were fresh fresh fresh.  Great combination of fresh ingredients.  Didn't overdue the hummus, which I find they often do around toronto...it was a good combination of hummus, mayo, hot sauce, and tahini.  

Also, cheap...the sandwich was under 4 bucks..shawarma sandwiches are under 5...and they had even cheaper combos.

I'll definitely go back and try the shawarma, it looked really good as well...none of the shawarma was sitting around..they were cutting it off fresh.  

They also have nargila (hookah) which I will have to try. I'm not exactly sure how that works with smoking licences...but I'm sure I will be checking it out."}
{"text":"Staff is really funny, the lounge for shisha is pretty outdated and needs some renovations done. However, it is very affordable. Not the cleanest place, and you'll see a lot of students hanging out around there."}
{"text":"This place definitely falls in the \"A-OK\" category for me - nothing to complain about but nothing to compel me to rush back either.

It is nicer inside than it looks (from outside it looks like a quick take out join, but there is a nicer area towards the back which looks like a proper restaurant)

I had a chicken shawarma salad, which was pretty much self-explanatory, for $5.99. The falafel and shawarma sandwiches looked pretty fresh & tasty. 

Service was good too!"}
