{"text":"Love this place for breakfast!  Courteous staff, great food.  Our entire family enjoys eating here."}
{"text":"They were able to setup an 8 person table in 10 minutes when I called from the road.   Excellent service and tasty food!!!  Very clean and fresh."}
{"text":"Meal here was okay but don't bother with the french toast.  Found it to be the worse version of french toast I have ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service!  Nice clean restaurant, including the washrooms. Tasty, freshly squeezed orange juice and a delicious breakfast menu.  Home fried potatoes were VERY tasty and eggs were perfectly done! Whenever I have sausages with breakfast, I want them to taste EXACTLY like the sausages at Sunnyside Grill. There are other breakfast and brunch options within walking distance on St. Clair, but this is the one we'll be going back to again and again."}
{"text":"Decided to go for Fathers Day breakfast with my wife and 7 month old son. First off food was undercooked the homefries were pretty much raw on the inside, bacon was awfully chewy. But that was not the biggest dissapointment during our visit when my wife asked  if they had a change table in the bathroom the waitress replied with \"you either have to go to starbucks down the street or you can use the floor in the bathroom\" so it is definatly not family friendly if you have small children. Definatly will never be going back."}
{"text":"Food quality has decreased considerably over the past year and half. Terrible reheated home fries and low quality boxed eggs used in the omelettes.  Service has improved though. But I'm looking forward to trying other places in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Love the liberal use of corned beef in a number of dishes. Just a great diner."}
{"text":"Its fine the breakfast was fine it wasnt anything I remembered that made me give this place a rating of fine there prices were.......fine"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Guests are happy and neighbourly. Delicious breakfast (ordered light breakfast, husband ordered peameal breakfast), tasty coffee. Very family friendly and casual. Atmosphere is fresh and clean - kitchen is open concept, you can see inside. Outside it doesn't stand out, we almost passed by, but it's a hidden jewel...with Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"As part of a special asked for all bacon instead of 2 bacon, 2 sausage and was told the dreaded \"no substitutions\" allowed. The restaurant was not busy, as it was early morning still, and the staff seemed forgetful. Asked for water, and didn't get it until the waitress was reminded.  The smoked meat was thin, and did not seem fresh at all.  Prices were a little exorbitant.   The design of the restaurant unfortunately makes sitting at any table near the door a cold experience.  Not recommended. Food was nothing special."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here and the pancakes! Always a pleasure eating here, friendly staff decent pricing!"}
{"text":"I dine here 1 or 2 times a week.  I enjoy getting there for the early bird breakfast on weekdays.  Traditional breakfast.  Service is friendly and knowledgable.  I have requested items not on the menu and they are accommodating (within reason).  The coffee is hot and plentiful.  As a vote of confidence I generally see 2 to 10 police enjoying breakfast."}
{"text":"Good place to go to get a great, cheap breakfast and avoid the line-ups at other breakfast places in the area. Friendly service, good food and great prices."}
{"text":"Completely mediocre. I was there on a Saturday at 12:30, it was fairly busy but we got a table right away. My major complaint with this place is the food is bland, under seasoned and just blah. I had the eggs Benny, English muffin was barely toasted so it became soggy. I requested soft poached, one was perfect and one was quite under, with a lot of the whites barely cooked. Hollandaise was ok, nothing exciting but not terrible. The potatoes were again just ok, but needed salt desperately. It looked like they had been cooked awhile ago, at some point they were crispy, but by the time the had got to me, they were steamed and soft. My son had scrambled eggs and sausage, the eggs were rubbery and the sausage had the same issue as the potatoes, crispy in another life, but soggy in this one.   If you're in the neighbourhood and you want a proper breakfast, just go to Emma's!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, good service, not too busy any time I've been there, very decent and no complaints."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Steak Benny! They layer in mushrooms, onion, and bacon bits between the steak and the sauce. Great clean place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get my Belgian Waffle fix! I'm quite picky about waffles and I'm happy to say this Sunnyside gets it right every time. What I like is that the waffle is perfectly fluffy and crispy on the outside without being overdone. They also have delicious fresh fruit options to choose from with a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side. I love that all the waffle extras are served separately so you can eat at leisure without the waffle getting soggy (pet peeve).  My second favourite breakfast item is pancakes and once again, this Sunnyside location doesn't disappoint! The pancakes are huge, old-school, fluffy and oh so satisfying. I usually get their black coffee, which is great and comes with free refills. Recently, I ordered a Nespresso and I have to say it elevated the breakfast experience for me and would be my choice henceforth.  On occasion I've sampled the eggs and savoury items from the menu and never been disappointed. The food is prepared with care and is not greasy at all unlike other diner food I've tasted.   The cafe itself is decorated beautifully - little touches such as the blackboard menu and seasonal window display set it apart from other typical franchise diners. The service is warm and inviting as well - it's a family run restaurant and you can tell that they have plenty of happy regulars (me included!). All in all, with the amazing service and great food at very reasonable prices it's no surprise that this is one of my favourite places for brunch!"}
{"text":"Nice , clean and friendly place to have breakfast .  The food is good .  I had the traditional breakfast..... 2 coffee.  All good.. will be back"}
{"text":"You gotta come here for the value and great service! The food is eggsellent and great portions for the price. The owner Angel lives up to her name, she is friendly and the staff is awesome too, highly recommend for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Casual.  Very clean. Friendly staff. Exceptional pancakes!! The eggs were good as well.  Didn't try any of the lunch items. Omelettes a little short on the ingredients. It's bright with lots of windows.  Easily missed given its location so look out for it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant and we will not go back. We did feel sorry for the server who was serving the entire place and her service was adequate given what she had to do.   One order was missing the sausages that were supposed to be there. The other order was supposed to have swiss cheese not cheddar on the sandwich which was a very disappointing Monte Cristo.  (Very little egg in the French toast). All the home fries were undercooked, tasteless and too cold to enjoy. The portion was large though but we left most of them on the plate.    Owner...you need to get more staff in the kitchen and serving. The place was busy for a weekday but they may not come back."}
{"text":"Just tried this breakfast joint, didn't want the same old from Boom. On the way to Tricolore but got sidetracked. Will come to Sunnyside again with the family for sure. Coffee good. Light breakfast was just right. My companion had the meat plate (aka the Super Sunnyside).  They even have a counter with stools, flashing back to our family's favourite the dear departed Tivoli. WiFi and all you can eat pancakes/French toast on certain days? Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Everything you look for in a great breakfast joint. Food is great, prices are too, and the staff are usually wonderful."}
{"text":"Eggs were served runny when asked for medium hard poched wfinaly when the waitress came to see if i wanted the bill I told her and she said she was sorry Maybe next time wow maybe next time I dont think so."}
{"text":"I love going here! I go for all the great occasions, like breakfast on prom day. I'll probably go for breakfast on my wedding day too.   This place has a cozy safe feel to it, for me. You'll have to sit for a few minutes to get the vibe because I am certainly not talking about the decor. It's the friendly servers who refill your coffee whenever you want, and the fresh tasting orange juice (I don't know if it's actually fresh squeezed).   They have all regular english breakfast fares, except the biscuit I think. Bacon, sausage, steak, eggs, home fries, toast. It's all good!   I usually get their home fries and egg combo with a fruit and yogurt on the side. It's the perfect breakfast to get a big day going. Plus, it's on lakeshore in downtown Oakville, cute place to have breakfast for sure.  During warm weather months, they have a couple of small tables outside; so you can have breakfast while people watching.    Great service, food and prices! :) Sunnyside is a gem; check it out."}
{"text":"Went for late Sunday breakfast. I love breakfast. For the prices and my personalizing the menu for a healthy option, they got it right on. So it was simple- eg. whites, fruit and toast. Fresh OJ is a plus. My friends seemed just as satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for brunch, and probably would've missed this place if it weren't for Yelp! Tucked away in a little plaza off of Yonge and Elgin Mills, Sunnyside delivers good food and good service!   This place has a bright and family oriented atmosphere that serves your classic breakfast dishes at very reasonable prices. We were very pleased with the food along with the the service.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love the place, the waiters are friendly   Excelente sitio!, desayuno rico y lugar agradable"}
{"text":"Definitely not going back to this place. Over priced, poor service, and terrible food.   This place was nothing like what some of these reviews say. We got a table right away but we had to ask that it be cleaned and set. Three tables around us had not been cleared the whole time we were there and were left with garbage and food.     We ordered coffee and water and our food arrived before our drinks. Had to remind the server we ordered drinks. It wasn't overly busy and the service was so slow. Not once did the server come back and ask if everything was ok or even refill our coffee and water.   As for the food. We both ordered the all day breakfast and it was horrible. The potatoes were not cooked and soaked in grease. The eggs were ok but so oily and greasy."}
{"text":"There's not a 4.5 star button or I would've used it on this place. First I've eaten here three time before I wrote this review. So here comes the real deal. This place is a very small franchise type of breakfast place they're popping up all over Ontario. This store number six. Doesn't matter who really cooks breakfast. It  matters if you have a great staff. This place is clean and does your typical breakfast with a Sunnyside twist. I've had three different types of breakfast to date. Bacon and eggs Peameal bacon and eggs. Also Ive had the best interpretation of cornbeef hash I do believe anywhere in Ontario.   This is a good place that serves A Solid Breakfast with a good staff and pretty damn good breakfast line cooks. They're one thing I didn't like. I felt the bacon was to over cooked for me and most and that's about it.  Presentation is pretty good everything I've seen come out of the kitchen looks pretty delicious.  So if you're in south Mississauga and looking for a great breakfast that doesn't kill your wallet then this is the place for you.    Ps lots of Tv's and I bet if you ask they would put your favorite sporting event on in the morning for you soccer fans. Plenty of Tv's  for a small place."}
{"text":"I went there just because I saw it is 4 stars in yelp. Service was really so so -- waitress totally forgot the drinks we ordered-- I think it is because only one waitress for 5-6 tables at that time. Compared with coral, service is really 2 stars. Food is ok, I am surprised to see chips is one of the options in kids menu. I also didn't see any vegetable and fruits in plates at all."}
{"text":"This place must cater to retired persons. I have only been able to try it once in over two years due to their strange business hours.   When I went in for a cure to heavy drinking, the service was surprisingly slow when there were only two other tables with 4 persons each.   Waiting to be acknowledged took about 10 minutes. We were given another ten minutes with menus closed until our orders were taken. Then another 20+ minutes elapsed before the food arrived. Very simple orders for a proper short order cook. Eggs, sausages, hollandaise.  As mentioned, it was a first and only visit on an odd weekday off work, but not a great experience from the service standpoint.   The food was decent, and nothing outstanding, but not terribly amazing.   I wouldn't wait 40+ minutes for a totally average meal ever again tho."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat breakfast. As someone that goes every Friday I can say that this place has excellent food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was exceptionally good. The new place to go for breakfast in newmarket with the girlfriend or family."}
{"text":"This was my first time here since we were looking for a quick Sunday brunch in Oakville. The storefront (and presumably the interior) had undergone a makeover which has freshened up the place from a local greasy spoon to a hipper looking brunch joint.   I had the eggs florentine which looked small on the plate but was actually quite tasty (although my all-time favourite eggs florentine is the one at Eggspectations). The potato side was decent and kind of bland. I tend to slather them in maple syrup to give it more flavour. The service was friendly (though a bit overwhelmed) and the place was packed both inside and outside which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Sandra our waiter was excellent! Our eggs benny was delicious! Thank you"}
{"text":"Small place only two people working. Coffee is not good very bland. Food is overpriced. Food is decent but paying $18 for an omelette and coffee is insane."}
{"text":"This is an attractive, clean restaurant that serves a good, greasy spoon style breakfast for cheap. The waiter was very attentive and efficient, and the coffee was above average. If you're in the 'hood, go!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, good quality and great prices. Everytime i go, the service is very good, huge portions and very fast from order to delivery. It's my fav new place for breakfast. Their menu is huge too with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken club sandwich with an egg and side order of fries. Nothing spectacular but no complaints either. Service was decent and pleasant.   I'd go there again but probably for breakfast this time around."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Fast basic breakfast. Good value. Very kid-friendly and cozy.  $4.99 early bird special from 7-10am.  Staff very attentive and friendly.    Had the \"Light & Lively\" bfast from the \"healthy\" menu. 1 egg, toasted bagel or english muffin & cup of yogurt with fruit.  The egg (easy over) was PERFECT and english muffin was toasted perfectly as well (crisp all around yet soft and chewy in the middle). Yogurt & fruit was surprisingly disappointing. Tasted like artificially sweetened fruity yogurt with too-sweet fruit in syrup ladled into it.  Did not eat.  Hubby had the french toast. Light and tasty but served with fake syrup (not real maple syrup).  Despite the yogurt and fake syrup would definitely go back again for a quick cheap early morning bfast."}
{"text":"New to the area and it was our first time coming here. Was not busy at all for a Sunday. Seated ourselves immediately and the waitress came and got our drink orders right away. Menu has lots of good looking options and everything is reasonably priced. Placed our order and they did not waste any time preparing the food. Food came out quick and everything was fresh. Potatoes might have been reheated which was the only downside but everything else was great. Good food and great service. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This Sunnyside Grill is amazing! Customer service is A+, the breakfast tastes amazing, and they're really quick with takeaway orders. I would definitely recommend the traditional breakfast with crispy home potatoes, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Does a reasonable job in terms of predictable diner food, but not earth shattering. Significantly better than Boom which is down the road and also offers a similar selection."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great price.  Was suspicious of reviews.  Typical greasy spoon.  Low in innovation.  High on taste.  Had the breakfast grilled cheese.  Added mayo for moisture and swapped for scrambled.   No problem with modifying.  Great non-formal service."}
{"text":"Wow! Wasn't expecting this from a strip mall. Staff was extremely friendly and courteous, served promptly, even though was one of the busiest times of the day/week. ... Coffee excellent! Above and beyond the expectations of a breakfast joint in the burbs!"}
{"text":"Meh, food was okay but NOT worth the price. Also, wait staff wasn't that great, most diners and breakfast places I've been to (breakfast is my favorite meal) have a cheery wait staff, however at sunny side grill everyone shows their frustration stress and morning grumpiness on the weekend we went. Wasn't that appealing to want to come back... Sad too because i wanted it to be my weekend spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for having breakfast with the family. Very kid friendly. Everyone there is cheerful and a perfect way to start your day."}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every other weekend when I lived in oakville. The interior is very cute and cozy. Friendly service and homey feel. Very fair pricing for a large portion of breakfast items. Convenient for people living in downtown area here to walk to. Only downfall is it can be quite crowded on mornings on weekends which is standard for any breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Decent breakfasty food. Decent eggs, toast and bacon."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. Had the Salmon sandwich, which was light but filling for a more than reasonable price. My cousin had the Oh so delicious traditional breakfast. All I can say is: Bring your appetite. Bon appétit!!!"}
{"text":"A super pleasant place for a delicious breakfast.  The Hubster and I came here Sunday at 1pm (peak time for the partier set) and were pleased to find no line up, no pretension and a tasty tasty breakfast at decent prices.  I'm not kidding when I say this place is pleasant. It's cozy, clean and yes.. sunny. The service is very friendly and their orange juice is fresh-squeezed. It's also quiet, which is great for those who may have overdone it the night before. A standard breakfast (2 eggs, bacon/sausage/ham, toast, homefries) is about $9. Their home fries are crispy on the outside, soft and nicely spiced.   Despite Boom being down the street, this is going to be our go-to breakfast spot in the neighbourhood. It's just as good without the high prices and the lineup."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time today. Nice little restaurant. Prices are reasonable, food was fantastic! Everything we ordered was perfect (even the bacon that I requested to be well done). Very friendly staff. We will definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here frequently because it's just a minute or two away from where we live. Every time I go I'm happy with the service and the food is always great. I also love a fresh cup of coffee and they're coffee is always fresh and really good. I've tried a lot of there menu items from the omelettes to peameal bacon (the peppercorn peameal bacon is delicious) fish and chips, and there basic breakfasts. I'm always impressed with food, it always tastes great, & I absolutely love the homefries!!!"}
{"text":"Well it was certainly worth a try.  Great food and the price is good too. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"We live in the hood and really like to support local businesses.  Having said that, our visits here are a mixed bag of neglect or amazing service.  The food is always always good it's just the service that can be annoying.  Once we waited 15 minutes to be noticed and actually walked out after that.  The last two times this one same server saved the day.  There is a weird mix of people who are quick and efficient and others who seem to move like they're in a sea of molasses.  Food is perfectly fine.  Just need some more consistency in service to make this a 5 star place."}
{"text":"There's an early bird special if you go before 930 (if I remember correctly) which gives you a handsome discount on the traditional breakfast (2 eggs, toast,  potatoes, choice of bacon or sausage etc) The server was friendly and attentive and was always available to top up my coffee.  If you want to reduce your carb intake they will replace your potatoes with tomatoes which go well with the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Super Sunnyside with pancakes instead of toast. The scrambled eggs were very unseasoned, but everything else tasted good. The potatoes had some type of seasoning salt that I enjoyed. Pancakes were a little over cooked for my liking. Overall it's a good place to eat, but certain foods need a little work."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I had the bacon burger with egg combo. It was delicious. One of the best burgers i've had. It came with a very generous portion of fries as well.   Staff was very friendly and sociable. The restaurant was also very clean. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this breakfast restaurant in the west end of the city.  Came here a few times and brought other immediate families here who all enjoyed their breakfast thoroughly.   The service is very warm and friendly which you really appreciate first thing in the morning.  We usually sit right by the entrance adjacent to the large patio door windows.  There is a very good selection for everybody, traditional breakfast, omelettes, salads, sandwiches, pancakes, cereal.  The best is their sausages, I went through a period of sausage craving during my pregnancy and this was the only breakfast joint where the sausage flavour hit the spot and brought back lots of childhood memories.  The bacon is always cooked to perfection (as per my hubby) and the portions are generous.    Our only thing is that the place gets quite smoky from the cooking and sometimes they got to open their patio doors a little to let some of the smoke out.  It's happened during the middle of winter but lucky it was a mild winter so despite the cold it wasn't too bad.  The waitress was very attentive and asked a few times if we were alright sitting right next to the cold and we appreciated her attentiveness in looking after us."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you go because you're hungry and because it's close by. I've been here twice because it's in the neighbourhood. Both times the food was average to put it kindly. They quite possibly have the worst potato hash I've seen - my plate of hash was only 3/4 cooked and my pancakes ridiculously thick and clunky. The eggs were thrown together with no seasoning it seems. I somehow ended up paying close to $20 for the I guess supreme special and a side of pancakes.   Overall - I was disappointed. The only redeeming quality was the waitstaff who were incredibly kind and attentive both during a sit down meal and take out order."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service by all. Nice, clean and relaxed environment. Lots of yummy food with each serving. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love brunch, but absolutely refuse to wait in line so I was very happy to find this place! It was constantly busy but there seemed to always be at least one available table. That's amazing for a Sunday morning. They also have a good size menu but not so big that it's overwhelming.  Like the open kitchen - gives it a great casual feeling. Coffee refills were constant.  Waffles, eggs and bacon for less than $15!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places you can have breakfast in the area. The portions are reasonable big and the price is good too. I've been there twice and the service is very good. Those two times that I went it was a Sunday morning and I had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated, so don't go over there if you are starving!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and in laws were in town and we wanted a central meeting point. My sister wanted more of a basic breakfast and we decided on here. We are so glad that we did. Great food, good service and good prices. They only have drip coffee (if you are a coffee snob) but I am told it is good. It is small, tables of 2 or 4. We had 5 so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was fine. We got to check out the food as it came out of the kitchen. The home fries were awesome, the eggs were cooked to order and I will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast before starting my journey back to Chicago. I got seated fairly quickly at a table for one. It was crowded, so of course I knew service wouldn't be the quickest, but I have to say, I had the most inattentive waitress ever. A guy that was seated a couple minutes before me had his food, ate and left before my waitress even remembered she took my order. The waitress was very apologetic, but still didn't even bother to refill my water or coffee.  All I had was an omelette; nothing complicated. So I'm pretty sure she just forgot to put in the order. The food was hot and delicious. The bus boy and seating host were kind enough to refill my coffee and water. The food, the bus boy and the seating host get 5 stars. My server...1...and only because she got my order right. I had to flag her down to pay, as she was having a friendly conversation with what seemed like regulars. She just put the amount into the credit card machine thing and left it at the table. Didn't even bring me a pen to sign my receipt. I didn't feel like flagging her down again. :-/ Worst. Server. Ever. I hope the bus boy took the tip I left..."}
{"text":"10 minutes to get seated. Waitress didn't wanna go check for an empty table, we seated ourselves. They casually left a dirty table with the cleaning solution and dirty rag in front of us, then 5 minutes later a waitress commenced to wipe the table while making sure to get as much of the sprayed solution and food falling to our laps. They seemed understaffed, but of their 3 waitresses, none seemed to want to serve us. Overall horrible service, food might be amazing, but it will not make up for our horrendous welcome and sitting at the restaurant. I suggest going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"When I first went had breakfast at this place, I didn't know what to expect! The service I received was great. Inside the restaurant is very spacious and open. In my opinion, the food tastes delicious! Try the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dip in here for breakfast all time, I love it, it's a classic little breakfast diner joint, service is always great and the food is good too.   What I don't understand is the renovation. It used to be this little retro old school themed diner in pale blues and yellows, it was adorable and perfect with a great atmosphere. After they renovated, we went to eat there and the decor was disappointing and confusing, it's like an uncomfortable mix of retro and modern. I'm super sad about it."}
{"text":"I try to come a few times a month for a great breakfast. We don't have many in the area that serve it all day.   There are great mixes of eggs/bacon/pancakes...so you can eat small or large...I usually get the super breakfast and it's just enough food. My only criticism would be the potatoes...if they had spices on them or would be better.    Service is amazing for a busy place. I have never seen any of the workers in A bad mood.   If you go in the morning you might have to wait 10-20 mins for a table but it's worth it. I like to go after 12pm and never usually wait"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We can't even review the food because, after waiting more than 45 minutes, and watching many tables who arrived after us eat, pay, and leave, we decided to leave too. We appreciated that their staff was new, but the manager was present and did nothing. And beyond the terrible service, the door kept opening and freezing everyone in the restaurant. Again the manager was right there and did nothing. This was the first, and definitely the last time we'll go here. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Sunnyside grill is sort of american diner sort of a place and a great place to go for brunch or for a quick bite. nothing fancy about it but it is good food at good prices. They have sort of egg with cheese and bacon in a english muffin thing + side of hush browns for $5.99. I had one of these and I loved it. My son had kids meal pancakes and they were great too. so yes, check it out for easy, reasonably priced brunch or diner sort of food. it's fair to say you gonna get good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"My breakfast joint?  You mean the one that serves up a decent breakfast special (under 7 buck) from 6 to 10 am Mon thru Fri? That place with all the specialty hot sauces? The one that's super clean, has a well maintained interior and super staff?     ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience at this place today! The waitress seemed to be on her deathbed, the atmosphere was terrible (the disco music they turned up didn't help either) and the hair my wife found in her salad didn't earn them any stars either. The food was average I suppose but another big minus for the salmon from a tin on the salad! If you're in the area I suggest either going next door to the croissant bakery or 3 doors down to Aroma Espresso Bar which has excellent food and coffee for roughly the same price."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place, waited over an hour for the food, actually the food hasn't even come yet.  It will ruin your day."}
{"text":"This turned out to be a great breakfast place. It has quite a bit of seating and lots of parking. I came at 9:30am on a Saturday and sat down right away no problem. Many other breakfast places in the GTA at that time would be lined up out the door and loud. I think the area it is in is probably why it isn't so populated and I am a-okay with that.  The service was quick and the staff is super friendly, you will never need to ask for a top up on coffee. I ordered the veggie omelette which came with potatoes and I chose dark rye bread for the side. The omelette was huge!!! And stuffed full of veggies and feta, it was fantastic. I actually am not much of an egg person but they did this with so many vegetables that I loved it. The potatoes were good too but I wish they were crispy. My dad got a pancake and bacon and the pancake was amazing. Old fashioned style pancake, slightly crispy outside and fluffy inside.  I ended up taking half my breakfast home and reheating it in the oven the next morning! It was just as good the next day. If you're sick of overcrowded places like Cora's I totally recommend coming here. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fabulous! Clean, bright and very friendly staff.  The home fries were delicious...pan fried crisp ( not deep fried or worse, soft like other breakfast places).  I ordered the florentine Benedict.  You can choose to have your spinach cooked or raw (I chose cooked). Hollandaise sauce was just ok.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and the pancakes were fluffy and huge.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Straight to the point breakfast, and a  very clean establishment. Service was friendly, and you can see into the kitchen which gives you piece of mind. My best friend and I had steak and eggs, with pancakes to start. We were very satisfied with everything, including the coffee they serve that was complimentary. I didn't give 5 stars only because there was nothing that really wow'd us, however for a good breakfast this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Another good breakfast and lunch restaurant opens in Newmarket.  Looking for a straight ahead eggs breakfast, I stopped in about a month after they opened.  The place is large, with limited acoustic treatments, so I would expect the place is loud when full of people.  The background music is also not what you would hear at other breakfast restaurants.  And they serve a Chocolate French Toast, so Sunnyside is definitely a different place.  The eggs were as good as any breakfast restaurant so you can't go wrong there.  The Chocolate French Toast was more of a plain French Toast drizzled with Hershey's Chocolate syrup. I guess that counts, but I would not make a Chocolate French Toast like that.  Prices are a bit on the higher side like Sunset Grill, compared to the specials at Donnelly's and Daybreak.  I'll be back to try more of the selection."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is hidden away on the edge of Mississauga and Oakville. It's your typical diner style breakfast but the quality is much better than your conventional diner style restaurant. The food was less greasy and full of flavor (home fries are usually my base line for quality.) I had the biggie Breakfast that came with a full platter of egg,s home friends, sausage, ham and bacon, rye toast and pancakes. Very delicious and the pancakes were cooked extremely well.   If you're looking for a good and reasonably priced breakfast restaurant in Oakville come check this place out."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place....fantastic food, great price, generous portions friendly staff"}
{"text":"I decided to come here after squash based on the positive Yelp reviews. Ordered the poached egg hollandaise for breakfast off the menu. It was very ordinary and plain, and came with a side of griddled potatoes. I've had a lot of poached eggs/egg Benedicts in my life, but I was rather disappointed when I took my first bite. It felt like I was eating completely raw eggs covered in sauce. It was a struggle to finish my food and I didn't experience my usual satisfaction eating breakfast. My expectations might've have went up, but it's really expensive paying for food that I can barely eat.   Our server was also kind of awkward. My friend and I would be eating our meals from across each other, and she would shove her hand to the middle of our table. Why? It was to move the menus like 1 cm away from our plates. It was awkward and disruptive to our dining experience. I much rather have her to provide me coffee refills when my mug gets empty."}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff and they are always on the ball. Prices are reasonable and a wide selection on the menu. My favourite part is that you can add one french toast or pancake to your breakfast order which I am always craving for. Their pancakes are not what you imagine to be thick and fluffy, but it's got a nice fluff and chewiness to them that they soak in just the right amount of syrup. Unfortunately they don't have an espresso machine - that is their only downfall. I would definitely visit more often if I could get a nice cup of latte with my breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was terrible. I got a turkey burger which was burnt to a crisp and tasted like freezer burn. The poutine had a weird taste."}
{"text":"Omg The best breakfast place I ever been to. I got something called the super. 3Eggs 3saugase 4 bacon stripes a big slice of cooked ham French fries never been fully in a breakfast place ever. Their O.j. and chocolate milk tasted great. So much cereals that I haven't even seen in stores to choice from.  Overall great place to come sit and hang out."}
{"text":"The staff wasn't friendly and it seems they just waited to close their morning shift..food was ok but not more than that! Not planning to revisit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot. Every weekend I take my family here for a big, friendly, reasonably priced breakfast. The service just can't be beat, and the food is great for traditional North American breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been living in this neighborhood all my life and this was the first time I stepped into Sunnyside; from start to finish I felt it was a great experience. The staff are very sociable and friendly, the food arrived in a very timely manner, so kudos to the back of the house staff, the portion would be more than enough to hold down a hungry fella. I'll be sure to make myself a regular here."}
{"text":"Not great. Ordered the eggs florentine with hollandaise on the side. The spinach was tossed on raw and half of it was black and mushy/wilted. I guess that would have normally been hidden by the hollandaise... but it wasn't. I couldn't believe they served it like that. The chef clearly doesn't care about the quality of food."}
{"text":"Visited for brunch at about 11 a.m. on June 12th. I ordered the eggs Florentine. I got an over buttered rendition of a Hollandaise sauce and raw spinach with a side of burnt \"home fries\". Eggs Florentine is traditionally made with blanched spinach. After complaining, the waitress said, \"that's how we make ours\". She offered to take it back but if I've learned anything from the media, it's don't send back your food! She then concluded with, let us know next time and we'll grill the spinach. Uhhh... there won't be a next time!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent but I can't stress enough how loud and grating this place is, easily the noisiest non bar I've ever been in, just a poorly designed building.    Combine this with the poor layout that has wait staff pushing past you as you try and get in and out and I still give it 4 stars...the food is that good!  Service was very friendly this visit but pretty slow...still 4 stars :-)  Parking can be challenging on Lakeshore too.  Hopefully the new, bigger Burlington location is just as good with 90% less noise & better parking.  I know it will be a better layout in the old pizza hut at New/Appleby."}
{"text":"My family was in town this weekend and wanted to go out for breakfast around 9 on Sunday morning. This is earlier than I would normally be up, but since my parents are early risers, I wasn't going to argue. After my Mom looked at the menus of a couple of places that had generally positive reviews (she's allergic to milk, so we like to make sure she has plenty of choices before going somewhere, more on that later), we settled on Sunnyside.  Our group of six was seated immediately upon entry, presumably due to the fact that it was still so early. It definitely got busier as time went on, although by the time we left (around 10:30), there were still some empty tables. The service was fast and friendly, and our coffee cups never sat empty for long. The food itself was delicious, and the portions were substantial - great value for the price! I ordered an omelette and I felt satisfied upon finishing it, a good sign considering my voracious appetite.  When my Mom notified our server about her allergy, she was told that they usually cook with some type of oil/grease that contains dairy (I can't remember the name of it), but the server indicated they'd have no trouble accommodating her restriction. When our food arrived, my Mom noticed that her meal wasn't as hot as she would've liked, presumably due to the fact that the cooks prepared her plate in advance of the rest of us. I also noticed that other people, who were seated and ordered after us, received their food before we did. I'm not sure if this is considered a faux pas, but when I worked in a restaurant, we made absolutely sure to avoid doing this. If it weren't for these two minor complaints (and moreso the first one), I might have given the place 5 stars, and if I could, I'd probably rate it 4.5 rather than 4.  I could definitely see myself returning, and won't hesitate to recommend this spot to anyone else!"}
{"text":"Stop looking at other reviews and go here.  Everything you want in a breakfast place!  Starting with the food - absolutely fantastic!!  Highly recommend the Poached Eggs California, the french toast, the pancakes (our kids loved them!) and the special Salmon Hollandaise was to die for!   Now the service.  The owner, Angel, could not have been sweeter, more friendly, and more attentive; an absolute delight!  :)    She recently traded in her corporate job to open Sunnyside Grill, and has amalgamated a tasty menu, charming decor, and service with true Canadian hospitality and charm into a place that should not be missed!!  (No we're not relatives - we just really had that good of a meal and experience so felt compelled to share!!)"}
{"text":"This was my brunch spot, meeting an old friend. Nice little place. I ordered the Original breakfast..2 eggs, 2 bacon, home fries (which were very salty) & dark rye toast. All the food was good but not great. I found the home fries were not as tasty as they looked but I can't put my finger on what the off-taste was for me?!  I also ordered a tuna salad to go which was disappointing as it was just lettuce & tuna. One hing I can say is the service was very good & our waitress was very pleasant. I WOULD eat here again."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and best lunch and breakfast I strongly recommend you should come and try the food"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends after a fun night of dancing, in desperate need of some greasy nourishment to fill my grumbling belly. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much more than just your run-of-the-mill greasy spoon, but I was wonderfully surprised. The place was fairly busy and there was a bit of a wait, however the host was well organized and attentive, keeping us continually updated. Once we did sit down, our server was friendly and efficient. I went with the delicious sounding tomato and feta omelette. The tomatoes were marinaded in a little bit of vinegar and some herbs, almost like bruschetta. It was delicious with the marinaded tomatoes balancing out the salty feta. Definitely keeping this idea in my back pocket! Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with my serve and food, and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant about two years ago. I loved them! Fresh food, friendly service, excellent coffee.  I went there today and was not impressed. We waited about five minutes for a table, which we were fine with. They cleaned it quickly and we sat down. However, I noticed ants crawling on the corner of my table. They were babies, so this isn't a serious problem in the restaurant, yet. I couldn't get the attention of the waiter to get the table cleaned, so I killed then with a sugar packet and let it be.   We ordered coffee, which came quickly. Our cups were dirty, with clear stains on the sides. We waited about ten minutes for refills, which I find is normal.   We placed our order. The food came quickly, and was okay. I came with my sister and my friend.   My friend chose to create his own meal, which came on separate plates.   My sisters eggs were over cooked.   My food was okay. It was not very presentable, but was delicious.   All in all, it was an okay experience, but I've had better at other restaurants. If I had the choice, I would go to any of the over breakfast places on St. Clair."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday while in Toronto just for a quick lunch. Sunny Side is just a good no frills place that serves good simple meals. I had a Greek salad with chicken because I was craving something fresh. Salad was crisp and the chicken was perfectly cooked and served warm. I have to give them props for not over cooking a simple chicken breast which so many restaurants do. I wish the Greek salad came with some pita bread or something- I mean I am trying to eat healthy but I need a little more than a plate of lettuce with chicken. I also think they should add a small side of tzatziki sauce to keep with the Greek theme and add some pop of flavor to the dish. However, I would come back here for breakfast or lunch  anytime. My waitress was very friendly and the service was quick. They also have a wall of cereal which I assume you can choose from if you just want a childhood favorite. Not much to complain about here, just add a little more to my salad and I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful place filled with nice staff and delicious  food. We enjoyed our breakfast meal."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast. Three of us got omelettes and Jessy got a benedict. They were all good, standard diner fare, generous portions. We also got excellent service, but that might be because the place was so empty. :)"}
{"text":"Place was clean and the menu looked good. Came here based on a recommendation.  We got there at 11:30am and was seated promptly (table of 5). It took our server about 10 mins to take our drink order. She played the game of trying to remember what we ordered by memory and circled back to ask us what we ordered again. Please just write it down.   When drinks arrived, the coffee was accompanied by those little milk cups. When one was opened and poured out, it was chunky and curdled. We asked the server and she said \"ewww that creeps me out!\". We didn't even know what to say to that. She brought a second batch of milk cups and the same thing (we also noticed they weren't cold). After that, she finally brought some fresh, cold milk.   Another 20 mins goes by and she came back to say \"has anyone taken your order?\" We responded with a \"No\" and looked at each other in awe. She's the one servicing our table - shouldn't she know?! She then played the game of trying to remember our orders by memory and then circled back later to try and confirm. Please just write it down. There's no shame in that.   When our food arrived it was overall good and tasty. Only complaint was that the poutine was extremely salty, almost inedible. By that time we didn't have any more energy to complain again.  Getting the bill was also an exercise of patience as it took almost another 15 mins to get it and pay with the terminal."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 3 star because the service was good and kind, the Egg Benedict was not good, the sauce especially was too sour, no specialty coffee brings the review automatically for me by 1 star. Probably will visit again and give one more chance just as its besides my home."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for breakfast. Me and my family go to Sunny Side a couple times a month and always leave happy and full.   Great good and amazing service. It's a great family run breakfast place. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. Nice setup with lots of seating (considering the place itself is pretty small).  Washrooms are downstairs.  Food was really good.  I ordered the Super Sunnyside (3 eggs, bacon, sausages, ham, potatoes) and it tasted like a home cooked meal. They were pretty busy and needed a couple reminders to bring me my toast, but otherwise service was fine (brought us coffee right when we arrived, refilled it quickly, etc.)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Biggie Breakfast on Uber eats and when I received my order, there were kind messages written on the containers. I was having a really bad day so the I expected messages really cheered me up and I really appreciated it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast! Good food, good service. Only complaint would be the music. Too loud and doesn't suit the place."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Order was wrong, waitress doesn't use a pen to take orders. Asked for the order three times and still got it wrong. We only had three people. Can you imagine a party of eight. The potatoes are frozen as are the breakfast sausage links. These are the cheapest type of sausage money can buy. Basically a smaller hotdog seiner packed with salt. Eggs were all supposed to be over easy but turned out over hard. How hard is it to make eggs. This restaurant cannot even get the most basic things right. How do you F up eggs? The restaurant at the time had at most 20 customers. Our order took 20 minutes. This goes from service all the way to the food. I believe you are better off at any one of the Eggsmart franchises than this monstrosity."}
{"text":"The food was very good! It wasn't extremely to die for I'm moving to Canada for this restaurant, but it was very good! The owner and waitress were really nice. They are very child friendly and I love their healthy options menu. Overall, 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My fiancé got the traditional breakfast and I got the Belgian waffle. Both meals were pretty good, but here is definitely room for improvement regarding the service. Our coffee cups were empty for a good 20 minutes. To be fair, it was busy. All things being equal, it's not a bad spot to grab a bite, but there are at least 3 better spots in the area."}
{"text":"My third time coming here and I remember why. The food is on point, classic breakfast spot. Service is great, even when they're slammed, they make it a point to pay attention. Good spot overall"}
{"text":"It's a very cost effective breakfast place.  Kid friendly and very attentive staff!  The bacon was cooked perfectly and the pancakes were delicious!   We never felt rushed during our meal, over all we had a great experience and would be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in toronto. I discovered this restaurant about a month ago and since that day i come almost everyday to try a new breakfast that they offer.  As soon as u walk through the entrance, u r welcomed with a big smile from the staff. The colours and the whole decoration theme are very vibrant and colourful which instantly elavate ur mood as soon as u walk in.   As for the food, it has a homemade taste to it which is something that a lot of restaurants lack here in toronto (at least in my opinion). The protions are huge in the breakfast menu. The prices are decent for the amount of food u get.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to start his day with a tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"Sunnyside Grill Is your typical brunch place.  Physically the place is bright and clean.  The spacing between some of the tables were a bit tight as the guy who sat behind me literally was rubbing his shoulders with mine. Good selections on the menu to choose from.  I ended up having the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausages, and griddled potatoes.  The potatoes were a bit dry.   My friend had to go up to the counter to get her coffee refilled as the server didn't come to check consistently. My cup of water smelled like eggs.  And we waited for a while for our bill but in the end decided to go to the counter to get our bill instead.  I noticed other diners had their bills brought to them.   Lots of other brunch restaurants to try.  Moving on......."}
{"text":"Two of us went for a late brunch and were not disappointed. Service was prompt; waitress was courteous. She brought rye toast instead of wholewheat but I kept it anyway; she offered to replace it.   A cook/chef came from the back to apologize to the guests at the table next to us who were waiting about 15mins; the staff had somehow lost the slip with their original order. I thought that was very good; usually the wait staff are the ones to do that kinda dirty work.   I'll certainly go back another day."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and it was good. The place isn't new anymore but it still looks brand new.   It's seat yourself, we were lucky to find a table tucked away by the glass. It was super busy on a Saturday around 12:30.   Ordered the traditional breakfast with a side pancake. Was a lot of food. Especially for only $11.99.   Food quality was nothing but average however, with my meal being comparable to one from Denny's. Again not amazing but edible. The side potatoes were real potatoes, those were probably my favourite.   Another thing to take from this visit was the prices. Most meals on the menu were priced fairly, they don't up charge you really or rip you off. But it depends on whether you add extras to your meal or not. I did notice some things on the \"extras\" portion of the menu like \"one egg\" @ $2.39 which is a tad ridiculous.     Will I be back. Yes. Serving size to price ratio for me will bring me back. Coras and Sunset Grill really have some GOOD competition in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place lives somewhere in between diner dive and fancy brunch spot, which for me is not the sweet spot. I much prefer it cheap and cheerful or gastro-fabulous, but these breakfast spots definitely have their place in society, and we were hungry.   Three of us went for breakfast, and got the traditional breakfast combos: two meats, two eggs, toast and potato things, waffles and coffee and one fresh OJ and it came to a little over $40. Too steep for what it was, but still pretty tasty.   Lovely waitstaff, exposed brick and some breakfast. This place is probably a lot of peoples' jam... and peanut butter. They have peanut butter in individual packets on the tables. Cool."}
{"text":"This place is just \"OK.\"  My Husband and I recently ate here for breakfast. I ordered the traditional breakfast with a piece of french toast, and my Husband had the Super Sunnyside.  \"Cheap Eats\" is exactly what this restaurant is, and that's exactly what you get. While everything was alright, the potatoes were terrible - cold and bland. I can always tell they aren't good when my Husband reaches for the salt.  We both ordered pop and were given cans with glasses of ice. The waitress neglected to tell us that they charged us for each can we got, so we ended up paying for 4 cans, which were $2.00 each. The bill came to $30.00 with tax and ended up being $36.00 with the tip.   While I feel that this restaurant is alright and I might come here again, there are many more breakfast type restaurants that I'd choose to go to first, like Ben and Florentine's, Cora or Denny's. It's just not remarkable, and that's OK, but when there are so many options for breakfast in Oakville, maybe you need to be."}
