{"text":"This is the one place i cant wait to come back to every time im in Montreal. Its comfort food at its finest kind of like your grandma giving u a big warm hug but even better.  Favourites: Fried chicken Mac and cheese Hush puppies Brisket(with their home made bbq sauce) Biscuit and gravy Arnold palmer(drink)"}
{"text":"service was fantastic, fried chicken was a little underwhelming. home made sauces were an interesting touch!"}
{"text":"YES YES AND YES! Amazing restaurant. Love everything about it-- the food, the vibe, the employees. My one major complaint is that they need to open their large dining room more often because they have such a high volume of clients, especially during the summertime when they do their whole picnic basket thing. The average wait time is likeeeeee an hour to an hour and a half. I've had to forego satisfying my pulled pork craving numerous times because I couldn't deal with it. During the winter, it's not so bad. The longest I ever waited was 15-20 mins at around 7:30pm on a Friday.   Anyway, as for the food... the meat and 3's is my favourite. I usually get the pork or chicken with hushpuppies, sweet potato and creamy coleslaw. Real comfort food made with fresh ingredients. The Big Nasty is also a must-have. It's insanely rich, but your tastebuds will go nuts.   If you like iced tea and lemonade, they make a good homemade Arnold Palmer (I get it spiked with some bourbon). A bit too sweet for my liking, but I still order it anyway."}
{"text":"Livraison ultra efficace!!!!! Bouffe réconfortante et très bonne. Ca vaut le détours."}
{"text":"Sweet potatos so far the best in my life. The pumpkin cake really reminded me of my school years. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favourite restaurant in Montreal. Simple Southern food that's fresh and well done. Their desserts are inventive and delicious. It is my go-to place for birthday and celebratory dinners."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a couple of days ago. How did I survive without their food?! This place easily ranks in my top five Montreal restaurants. Their chicken is so good, their sauce, even better. Everything here is a hit. Their mac and cheese is the best in Montreal. Simply delicious. I will be dining here whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best FRIED CHICKEN in the city. Great Southern drinks, too!  If you're into Southern cooking, then Triple Crown is definitely worth a visit. While the Fried Chicken is my favorite, the Brisket is pretty damn good, too. Both of these and the Pulled Pork (which I haven't yet tried) are available as \"Meat and Threes\" where you can pick 3 of several side dishes.   Of all the different side dishes, I'd recommend Biscuits (best in the city), beans (made with bacon), and greens. But they're all pretty tasty.  Another great dish is the Big Nasty, which is a fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit topped with gravy. Gawd, it hits the spot.  I'd also suggest trying one of their many bourbon drinks, as well as deserts -- it's kinda unfair just how good the bread pudding is."}
{"text":"The first time I went here with my new crush. He had been raving about it so much, that I had to try it. We wanted to do the take out picnic basket, but the weather was the deciding factor. The place was packed, so we ate at the counter. They have a full dining room next door, which is cozy as well.  We ordered all the things, and shared everything. Colin Perry sure knows how to comfort you with food, and a distinct southern hospitality. Really like their hush puppies and sweet potato sides. Probably the two I order consistently.   It's been two and a half years since that first visit, and the experience is exactly the same every time we go. I'm forever greatful to have been introduced to this excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Great music, great beer,great mac'n cheese great service. Chicken a little bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Really delicious juicy tender chicken with a well flavored crust! Super friendly service! Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for awesome fried chicken"}
{"text":"Unique. Pour les picnic dans le parc et le délicieux poulet frit! Miam!"}
{"text":"By now, you may be tired of reading all the love and praise for this place. You may even read our words and think it sounds too good to be true... But please, believe the hype and go to this place. Like now. I want to ensure it stays here a long time because while we sat on the bench outside waiting for our food, I knew that this place was special.   The service was so friendly- I felt like I'd been there a hundred times. There are only a few seats at a counter, so you need to be able to have a plan to take it to go if it's full (which it likely will be)... Luckily the park is awesome with a gazebo you can duck under in the rain. Pretty romantic, no?  I will say that it isn't the cheapest place in town BUT that may be a good thing as I don't know how often I should be eating fried chicken and salted caramel milkshakes...  What a city we live in!!"}
{"text":"My review is not necessary because everyone else nailed it. This place is simply awesome. The fried chicken is so delicious and not greasy at all. You will not feel bloated or disgusting after eating at the Triple Crown. I recommend the salted caramel shake :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, this place has a lot of heart. Terrific southern food! We tried the The Big Nasty (delicious fried chicken between moist biscuits covered in gravy) and the Brisket sandwich. Both were very flavorful, complimented by the array of homemade hot and BBQ sauces!  Excellent food, service and most of all- a charming old style atmosphere. A definite visit for those in Little Italy seeking terrific southern style food."}
{"text":"Legit southern food. Best in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went tonight and was pretty disappointed. I had the brisket sandwich and my friend had the fried chicken. We shared the creamy coleslaw and the sweet potato side. The brisket was really fatty and hard to bite through. The sauce and the bun were good though. The fried chicken was not crispy, pretty soggy. The creamy coleslaw was delicious. There were 4 sweet potato pieces, and the 2 smaller ones were good. However, the 2 larger pieces were pretty undercooked and not really edible. Sauce that went with them was good. Had the lemonade, that was good too. It was nice having a picnic, but for 41$, it wasn't worth it and I don't plan on going back. Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun, imo, is much better."}

{"text":"On m'a vanté les mérites de Triple Crown Dinette tellement de fois. J'avais mis mes attentes très hautes et lorsque le Lunch Break à la Yelp a eu lieu hier, ce fut l'occasion rêvée de tester enfin le poulet frit. Je suis arrivée et j'ai commandé du Mac and Cheese (évidemment), un pain au maïs et deux morceaux de poulet. Et j'ai attendu. J'ai attendu longtemps. Trop longtemps. À vrai dire, si j'avais une pause lunch, j'aurais passé 45 minutes de mon heure de pause en train d'attendre pour un lunch. Heureusement que je travaille à mon compte...  Parlons bouffe maintenant. Le pain au maïs est délicieux et le poulet frit est vraiment bon. Exactement à la bonne manière Southern: juteux, bien cuit et croustillant. Un plaisir pour papilles. Quant au mac and cheese... Le mac and cheese avait un gros problème de goût. Je ne sais pas ce qu'ils mettent dedans. De l'alcool style bourbon dans leur sauce ou encore du hickory liquide pour la saveur, mais il y en avait trop et ça monte au coeur rapidement. La première bouchée est correct, mais le reste... J'ai eu de la misère à finir tellement que le goût était fort.  Ceci dit leur limonade est délicieuse et le concept pique-nique est des plus parfaits pour profiter du Parc de la Petite Italie. C'est sûr que je vais y retourner, mais cette fois-ci j'espère que ça sera plus rapide!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a place like this in Montréal, it's totally unique and oh so fantastic in every way. The kind of place where you just want to keep coming back to try everything on the menu and you won't feel guilty about it because food this good is a sin not to indulge in. I had the mac and cheese with a side of braised sweet potatoes which were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese what everything you hope it would be, thick creamy and tasty. My friend had the fried chicken corn bread and sweet potatoes. Everything was so delicious that It blew my mind.   I look forward to returning to try their milkshakes.   The service was also friendly and welcoming. Although the place is small, you can take your food out in a basket and have a picnic in the parc across the street.  This place is a must for summer dining!"}
{"text":"Cute baskets to eat in the park. A bit greasy comfort food, but you cannot expect to be on a diet when you go to a dinner:) great date with hubby, bring a large blanket, you'll have a great pick nick!! Memorable!!"}
{"text":"Went there  because of the good reviews on yelp. First of all, the lady who greet us was moody and arrogant. Then we waited about 15 minutes for her to come and get our order, then after that we waited for another 30 min get our food wow, what a waste of time. About the food, ordered pulled pork, mac and cheese and cucumber salad. Food was horrible and tasteless. Pulled porc:rolled inside my mouth,they did not even put salt in there and the worst is that the cucumber salad was salty as hell.Mac & chesse no word to describe yark!!! not good at all. avoid this place.spend your money somewhere else than this place!! Bad food &bad service and too expensive!!"}
{"text":"Great food, ambience, service... I tried the fried chicken and sweet potatoes. Both very tasteful (not magical though). Lemonade was not the best. I do suggest this place for take-out as they will pack your order on a picnic ready basket with everything you need. I did not try the bar but it looks good. Next time I will call ahead for my order and enjoy it in the park across the street on a perfect picnic set."}
{"text":"Very good meal and a great idea.  This little Gem located in Little Italy is a perfect combination of southern food with a montreal twist. Their fried chicken is must, it has a nice light batter with a wonderful crunch. All meals come with sides, and I must say that their corn bread and mac and cheese are definitely 2 choices u have to get. The side we chose Were sweet potato, hush puppies, cole slaw and the pinto beans, the slaw was Ok, the other choices were delicious.  I highly recommend you try TCD, although a little pricey, especially a half portion of mac&cheese for 8$ this restaurant puts a lot of care in their food, not to mention the awesome concept of dining in the park. Great!!!!! Idea.  They offer you a pic-nik basket with all you need to enjoy your meal across the street in park petite Italy, its a great experience to go along with a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"They have great choices that are very can be considered \"custom\" to the customer. If you love to eat (or are just really hungry that night) then the MEAT AND THREES option will satisfy you! If not - well there are some great single options too.  The picnic basket is adorable and sturdy (thankfully). The food gives you that Southern Vacation feel (without the trip of course). It's definitely a place to try with visiting family or a night out with friends. If you're in a \"try something new\" mood, Dinette Triple Crown is certainly the place.   This place is definitely more about the concept than about the food itself. That being said, the food IS great, just not five star worthy...and aren't restaurants about the cuisine first? One more thing - be prepared to WAIT (a twenty minute wait for us just last night)..."}
{"text":"Spent a couple of summers visiting family in Mississippi so i know real Southern soul food. This place is hands down the best I've ever had in Montreal. It was as authentic as it gets. The  fried chicken was delicious and not overly breaded like most places. The mashed potatoes were so creamy... and the gravy... don't even get me started on the gravy, it took all my restraint not to guzzle it. Let me not forget to mention the bacon/caramel milkshake...I was really skeptical about what it would taste like but as soon as that liquid candy touched my lips I was a believer.  The two little things were it was really cramped (not a big issue just make sure you call in advance or just take your food to go) and the cornbread was a little on the white said (lacked that distinctive yellow color).  I highly recommend this restaurant to any soul food lover.  Truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome food, well worth the price.  Real good biscuit, okay fried chicken (moreso rubbed spice, than battered), surprising mac & cheese, nice and buttery mashed tatters, real good and sweet potatoes, nicely seasoned \"hush-puppies\".  My only regret is not asking for dark meat for the fried chicken pieces.  Everything I tried on the menu was exceptional and delicious. I will be cumming again."}
{"text":"Vintage dinner southern food... What's not to love.  I love that they serve drinks in mason jar (pot masson) and who wouldn't love their piknik option?? They give you your order in a basket and you go eat at the park in front of the restaurant. Expect long long wait when the weather is nice.   About the food: I took the fried chicken: good chicken great gravy. Let's be honest it's a little bit like eating KFC but without the guilt feeling ;) The biscuits are AMAZING    They have home made sauce on the table who blew us away. My boyfriend took the pulled pork and the food was super tasty.  Amazing food if you like southern friend food, a little expensive for what it is.  But taking your food to the park makes it worth it. The rustic feeling in the dinner is not as charming in the winter but I love the extension they done. It feels a little bit like a sugar shack.   It's comfort food at it's best. The southern version of our Cabane à sucre. A must try once but remember it's for the experience and the great gravy,(not as much for the chicken)!"}
{"text":"I M P R E S S I V E!!!   Can't believe Montreal has southern style BBQ done extremely well. The food is amazing and they don't just do the meats well, all sides were delicious! Amazing list of whiskeys. Too bad Costo doesn't carry Basil Hayden anymore cuz they were their supplier. Bring it back!  The concept is equally amazing! They parked their small store operation on the corner end of a park so you could eat in, take out or picnic in the park. Although it was slightly chilly outside, we couldn't resist. The waitress carefully packed our basket with our pulled pork, fried chicken and all our sides. They even pack a tablecloth, silverware, plates, water and mason jars for you. You know it's legit when the cook is from Kentucky. Love the open kitchen seeing all the guys running around prepping up awesome deliciousness. The ladies even had their hair in southern belle styles which I thought was a nice touch.  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with great fried chicken and waffles. The best I've ever tried! I would be back in a heartbeat. We also ordered the mac n cheese for our toddler and a johnny cake to try. All amazing. I got a wing for one of my pieces of chicken so I asked for another. They obliged for a small fee. Overall fab experience."}
{"text":"Big Nasty sandwich is amazing!  I like the places where the people is keeping the traditions what et how to cook. Nice southern food, \"home-sweet-home\" atmosphere and a little bit country style. I know only one place which can be competitive with Dinette but is so far for having a lunch... So, definitely, 5 stars for Dinette."}
{"text":"Good food! The picnic in the park across the street option is fantastic.  It's also very baby friendly which I am loving these days.  Perfect for summer!"}
{"text":"Coming from the South, I have eaten more than my fair share of hushpuppies.  I would give the Dinette Triple Crown a five-star rating based just on their hushpuppies alone because they are probably the best I have ever had.    Fortunately, I don't have to base my rating solely on hushpuppies because everything I've tried  on the menu has been impressive. What is especially unique about this place, though, is that these guys strive to use locally-available ingredients to creatively reinvent Southern-style food in a way that still feels authentic. For instance, in all my Southern dealings, I've never encountered a pumpkin-seed-based hot sauce, but the Triple Crown's in-house recipe has got the right combination of flavor and kick.   Basically, they just nailed it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but so disappointed once I did. Worst mac and cheese I had in a while. Chicken was very so-so. Nothing was on point. I don't get the hype over this place. Plus, it wasn't cheap."}
{"text":"Great service! Loved mostly all : Chicken was amazing perfect and I got a breast piece and a leg which is perfection to a lil gal like me.. Sweet potatoes and sauce or dressing was awsome crispy candied yum! I could have ate that mash and gravy all day , Mac n cheese was good but different , I still can't decide if I liked it. But the effort is there. Just one thing ; I felt like the cornbread looked better than it tasted.. And I wished I could have had dessert :0) Not cheap , but worth the treat. Definitely not low cal either ."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Pick a sunny afternoon and head over for a picnic basket!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is country cooking on a whole new level, I didn't know mac and cheese and fried chicken can be evaluated to such heights.   The restaurant is really small and hidden away, there's no sign for it except for a post of the daily menu outside its door. The decor is well curated and has a very refined feel to it, even tho it's supposedly a country dinner, this refinedness is reflected in the food as well.   Everything is made in house from scratch, that includes the bbq sauce and the condiments. The menu is really small (definitely not a bad thing) I ordered fried chicken, mac cheese, biscuit with gravy, and a (really delicious) old fashion cocktail. Each items were executed superbly and the favors of each dish really came thru without ever being greasy or too rich.   You can just tell everything is make with a lot of crafts and love. I will definitely come back and try their BBQ and other side dishes and cocktails next time!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to DTC, I leave a happy albeit poor camper.   Don't expect super crispy fried chicken but rather enjoy a flavourful well seasoned breaded delight.   In my opinion, the sides are where this place shines. The hush puppies are 100% worth it. They're like little nuggets of happiness. The biscuits are always warm and soft and do not miss out on the gravy. Do. Not.   I'm sort of glad that it's a bit of a splurge otherwise, I'd be there every other day.   Love this place."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and was overwhelmingly surprised at how lucky I was to have found it. There is no question that what they serve is heavy soul food, but they are able to do it without making the food feel greasy. The taste is clean, and the ingredients are of exceptional quality. Most importantly, though, is that the food is absolutely delicious. Their sauces are incredible, the fried chicken is juicy, and they serve the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Best Fried Chicken in Town!  Triple Crown does a very traditional southern fare menu that includes fried chicken, brisket, pulled pork, homemade biscuits, and all those other good things that represent everything that's good about southern home cooking.  Their \"Meat and Threes\" let's you choose from your preferred meat and 3 of 8 different side dishes, which helps keep it interested. They also have a three different sandwiches, of which The Big Nasty should be at the top of your list to try.  Although seating is limited, during the summer months you can have your order packed up in a picnic basket and take it to the park across the street. They'll even mix your cocktails in mason jars to take along, and their list of mostly bourbon cocktails is certainly worth some sampling.  And if, by chance, you have any room after filling up on biscuits, gravy, and other fixings, you might want to give the bread pudding a try -- it's actually the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Try the 'Le Big Nasty' and their hush puppies(best ever). Delicious and unpretentious. Very busy at peak house(lunch, supper)."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and it was very good. I like the idea of the picnic basket and you go at the park across the street."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! I had the three piece chicken, mash potatoes, hushpuppies and biscuit, all were tasty and fresh. Unreal service, great spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place!   Came here the first time with a large group of friends. We got a huge table in a clean, sunny, airy dining room. They also play good music there - all in all it's a great, relaxing atmosphere.   The selection for drinks is also fantastic. I had a sip of my friend's ginger beer and it's mind-blowing.   The menu is on the pricier side, but the portions are VERY generous, and more often than not it's more than enough food for one meal. I usually go for the classic Meats-and-3's, which means you get to choose 3 sides, on top of your choice of meat (fried chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket,etc.). I've only tried the fried chicken, and while it's decent it tends to be on the drier side, not so juicy. Definitely not the best fried chicken I've had.   I can't complain about the mashed potatoes and the gravy though - it's so deliciously creamy and buttery! Same for the biscuits. The creamy slaw, hushpuppies, red beans and rice are also some great choices for the sides.   My only gripe is that if you live downtown, this place is a bit far out and hard to reach by walk. The location and price is definitely what's stopping me from visiting more often. Other than that, it's a great place to bring a big group of friends and families."}
{"text":"Ma première fois à la petite Italie. J'ai été charmé par ce petit restaurant authentique. La collection de bourbon est extensive et les repas sont savoureux. J'ai préféré le poulet fris par rapport aux porc effiloché. A+"}
{"text":"Nice assortment of Comfort Food! Very friendly staff and nice explanation of their food and drinks . Very helpful for first time American visitors. Very small restaurant , almost just a take out establishment but an ingenious idea to make a picnic and go across the street and go into the lovely park! They were playing music and people were dancing and it was a lovely way to spend a Friday night! Mac and cheese was different but good. Very fresh and filling!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and Mac n cheese I ever had. Cozy ambience with great service you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"This spot is the jumpoff.  Seriously, the best fried chicken and pulled pork I've ever had.  The Mac n Cheese is off the chain.  The folks inside are so kind and helpful... really must be Canadians.  They hooked us up with a huge picnic basket, plates, real silverware, water and glasses (real glass!) and a tablecloth.  We ate outdoor on the picnic tables at Little Italy park across the street and had a straight-up feast!  We had some booze that they made for us... Kentucky Mule's and Old Fasioned's are out of this world from there.  The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must have for sweet potato enthusiasts like me.  The hushpuppies are deep fried cornbread and taste great too.  I was also a big fan of the collard greens... delish.  Very eclectic place inside... really feels like it is straight out of Kentucky or Tennessee.  The proprietor/chef is from Kentucky so you know this spot is legit.  I'm adding this place to my must hit spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"You don't bring your vegetarian friends here. This is the answer to comfort food. The braised brisket is melt in your mouth. The essence of a good fried chicken is moist meat and not greasy. The hushpuppies must be tried. Your tummy will be tickled and smiling bigger than the Buddha...well, almost."}
{"text":"Wow! That's a nice find (you must rely on the address to find it; no sign on the window). I nerve thought I could enjoy fried chicken so much! The pulled pork is also delicious. It is very well spiced and SO Yummy. It's a very small place, with very friendly service. Perfect for take out! The menu options are limited, but everything we tasted was fabulous (even the braised greens!). The Mac & cheese is outstanding. Good drinks options."}
{"text":"Second time visiting and it's even better than last time. The hush puppies get two thumbs up, really great and spiced so well. The chicken pieces are a bit small, if you ask me, but still delicious. I love southern fried chicken and this is delicious. Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Do you love comfort food and picnics? If the answer is yes, get a basket from the Triple Crown with all your favorite Southern treats such as mac 'n cheese, hush puppies, and pulled pork, and have a lunch in a park in Little Italy. Not a diet-friendly option for sure but a cheat-day-kinda thing to do on a sunny summer day. Very friendly staff, the drinks are served in cute and hipster-y mason jars. You cannot take the alcoholic cocktails outside which is a bit of a bummer but was not a deal breaker for us."}
{"text":"I loved the laid back vibe, the food was fantastic! The service while casual totally attentive. I loved the brisket, fried chicken, my 1st experience of hush puppies, the creamy Mexican corn salad, the potato salad, the Chess pie, the bourbon and the entire ambiance. I will be back. As I said to the server, I wish Dinette Triple Crown was around 20-30 years ago when I was really able to eat. I got a biscuit to go with my doggie bag for mom but didn't taste one myself. this event really brought to life my memories of New Orleans."}
{"text":"For some comfort southern food, I made the trek to Dinette Triple Crown for a satisfying dinner. The place is an old school diner, with around 10 bar stools that look onto the quiet street outside. There's black and white images of horses, perhaps a homage to their name. On a chilly night, this was a warm haven.   The menu had fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and lots of sides. Of course, I wanted everything. Sometimes though, what one wants and what the reality should be are quite different. So I settled on a 2 piece fried chicken plate, which gives me the options of 3 sides.  After some anticipation, my plate arrived. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside, without being overly oily, and the meat, although a bit dry, had lots of flavour. Now, the sides. It came with possibly one of the best biscuits I've ever had. Flaky and buttery, and warm. The other sides- a choice of vinegar or creamy coleslaw (I chose the vinegar), and sweet potatoes. The coleslaw was light, and the sweet potatoes were oven roasted to perfection.   As I savoured this delicious meal, I also got a sparkling lemonade to complement my meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and just a right amount of fizz.   Surely, I had to end my meal with a southern dessert. A pecan sugar pie with fresh whipped cream? I was sold. The pie crust was flaky and crispy, and it was filled with pecans.  There were lots of take out orders while I was there, and they also have a full dining room right next door. In the summer, this would make the perfect picnic to enjoy in the little pack across the street!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their fried chicken is great: very well seasoned and doesn't feel too greasy. The sides are delicious. I really like the hush puppies and the mash potatoes and gravy is incredibly delicious.  They should probably get a sign outside but seems like their reputation precedes them and they are quite busy. The option to take out in a picnic basket to eat the park across the street is very nice in summer."}
{"text":"My favorite place to cheat on a diet ! Best fried chicken and sauces. Their drinks are also totally worth it and the picnic kit is just the best idea ever. Staff is always nice and friendly. This little gem is just perfect and they should not change anything about it. Ask for the daily specials not on the menu and don't be scare to try something new there. I had once a vinegar / Mountain Dew pie (yes!) and it was amazing !"}
{"text":"I love Dinette Triple Crown! This is a go to spot for celebrations for me, or at least was. Their food and drinks are simply divine. They've expanded into a dining area, which has made for some good dining experiences. However, I can't give 5 stars because I've had some less than great experiences there too. You expect, when going out and throwing down a significant chunk of change, to have a pleasant dining experience where you can have a conversation, however this is not always the case at Dinette Triple Crown.  I've been in their dining room with large groups and the noise level has gotten to beyond irritating levels. Like the time we were seated next to a 25+ group of people... what was the point of eating in when we can't even hear each other? However I've also been there and it was wonderfully pleasant. I guess ultimately it's a fairly small spot so you should probably check with them ahead of time, and avoid going when they are hosting large groups, especially if you have a hearing impairment. Also, I wish gravy was a side option for the meat and threes menu item."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative, flavorful, fried chicken and mac'n cheese are my faves... Wait staff is amazing, owners and chefs and kind and welcoming. Very accommodating to allergies, which is much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Poulet/Pâtes aux fromages/ et les petites boules au pain de maïs sans oublier les drinks maison, tout est bon!  Une belle température, un panier de la dînette dans le parc et c'est le bonheur assuré!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I cannot wait to go back. It was the best southern food I ever had.  The place a bit hard to find because the sign is small and the front of the restaurant does not scream restaurant but it is worth the trouble I swear.   The second I walked in I wanted to try everything they had. I was not too sure how the menu worked but the waitress explained everything to us. She was amazingly friendly and super helpful. It was windy so didn't pick the picnic basket option so to walked one door down to sit in their new dinning room.   They have fried chicken and pork and tonnes of amazing and tasty side.  I had the chicken but I will be going soon to try the pork. The chicken was moist but I would of like it to have a little bit more flavor but turned out ok with the homestyle gravy and the different hot sauce on the table.  For the sides we tried the hush puppies and they are to die for. The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must try, the mac & cheese was the best so warm and tasty the only thing I was not crazy about was greens it was a bit watery.   They have a few fresh dessert of the day so never the same thing. That day they had an amazing blueberry pie with i cream and I had a chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whip cream and it was divine but extremely sweet.  They also have so many drinks with or without alcohol and to be able to try everything you need to go many times so for sure I will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a brilliant concept! This quaint American bbq diner allows its customer to place an order for takeout and take it to the park across the street. It comes in a picnic basket, with a red and white tablecloth so you can set up on the grass or on one of the numerous picnic tables. You can even order drinks, or bring your own if it's that type of day!   The food is pretty delicious too, especially the pulled pork. For 2, we had one meat+3 and a side of meat and it was plenty to make us full. If you are famished though, you should definitively indulge in your own plate.   Loved it, strongly recommend it, and will definitively return!"}
{"text":"Ça goute la vraie bouffe canadienne! Ce spot est définitivement un secret du quartier Rosemont-Petite Italie qui a beaucoup profiter du bouche à oreille et des blogueurs. Et avec raison! Un peu à l'écart des autres restos du quartier à son ouverture (moins maintenant car plusieurs autres options se trouvent autour) il vaut le détour pour le sandwich pulled pork, le poulet frit et surtout les Hushpuppies qui nous rendent addict! J'adore le décor à l'intérieur, mais il y a très peu de places. Une dizaine tout au plus. À essayer en après midi avant l'heure de rush si vous voulez manger sur place sinon prenez pour emporter car vers 17h le week-end ça se remplit en un claquement de doigt! J'ai moins aime le mac'n'cheese un peu trop crémeux et pas assez fromage mais le reste était très bon. Et c'est définitivement un must l'été pour les panier à piques-nique dans le parc à côté. C'est vraiment une belle expérience et impressionnant pour les gens qui ne viennent pas de Montréal. Si vous aimez le tango ou êtes un romantique né, optez pour les jeudis soirs car il y a des pratiques dans le gazebo du parc. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"On my way to another eatery, I was intrigued by the reviews and decided to override my initial choice. I ordered the 10 piece chicken, Mac and cheese, and the coleslaw. Because it was take out only, I was told it was about a 20 minute wait. I asked for the picnic basket so I could take it across the street and eat with my 3 children. 45 minutes later (!!!!) I ditched the picnic basket idea and went straight home. I now had big expectations for this much talked about fried chicken.  The big chunky pieces of chicken were fatty and undercooked. Unbelievable! The Mac and cheese lacked pep, and the coleslaw was actually the only saving grace of the whole meal and that's not great given my kids didn't get past the fatty chicken. Neither did I. It was frankly just gross. I really really really wanted to like this place as the people were friendly and the atmosphere lively.  Will keep looking for the best fried chicken because it's definitely not at this place."}
{"text":"Good but not great   I have been here a couple of times.  This is primarily a takeout restaurant, there are a few seats inside and a couple outside.  A vacant restaurant next door is being renovated to become a more permanent seating area later this year.  On really nice days, ask to borrow a picnic basket and take your munchies to the neighboring park.  On my last visit, I ordered two \"meat and threes\" plates:  one with fried chicken, one with pulled pork.  There was enough food for two meals each.  It was well packed in plastic containers, and was still warm even after a 40-minute trip home.  The chicken coating was unpleasantly soft; the pulled pork had not much sauce, and not too much flavor.  However I was disappointed with most of the sides:  soft fragile hush pupppies, extra-salty burnt cornbread, leathery sweet potatoes.  I didn't order any sauce, because it was extra -- on reflection, maybe a sauce would have livened things up a bit.  While I waited, the staff were very friendly and chatty.  The owner talked about the renovation plans for next door, the lack of air conditioning, and the possible locations for a second branch.  It was fun to watch the ginger beer and other drinks being made to order, shaken with ice in Mason jars.  I'd like to try a couple of other things on the menu, including their drinks.  But overall not very impressed."}
{"text":"while not fine dining, this is a supremely satisfying taste of american bbq.  Their fried chicken and mac and cheese are standouts, but i also love their duck gumbo and pulled pork.  this place doesn't disapoint."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!  If you're craving real southern US food then this is the place!  The corn bread is the only shortcoming to this place.  Otherwise the food and drinks are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ for Canada and a killer drink and beer menu.  Add to that a great 'hood and casual but competent servers and you have yourself a winner."}
{"text":"Fantastique soirée chez Dinette Triple Crown!  Vous allez attendre un petit peu avant d'être servi (parce que c'est toujours plein à craquer) mais les cocktails aideront à patienter sans effort! En parlant des cocktails, je vous recommande le Old Fashioned et le Kentucky Mule: une tuerie ! La cuisine est fabuleuse et sans prétention. Tout comme le décor.  Pour l'instant je n'ai testé que les morceaux de poulet frit et ses 3 à-côtés au choix: si vous y pensez, demandez le gravy and biscuit! Le personnel y est très sympathique.   Je recommande cet endroit 1000 fois. On y retournera certainement si le soleil se montre un jour, pour tenter le panier pique-nique que le restaurant propose ou encore pour une grande tablée entre amis!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants I miss from the years I lived in Montreal.  I recently moved back to the States (I'm a Virginia native) and the BBQ and other food here is fantastic.  The in-house lemonades and iced teas are also superb.  The basket idea that allows customers to walk across to the small park across the street is a great idea.  Friendly staff and often very busy, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"My experience here for some reason wasn't as good as i expected. The reviews looked great and even my boyfriend recommended Dinette Triple Crown. I did find their food delicious but the entire combo might have been too salty for my taste. The Macaroni tasted perfect but I would recommend not taking it with Hushpuppies. The fried chicken itself was mice but I wish they were crispier. I had better fried chicken in Montreal (re: Prohibition at NDG). I was not satisified with staff service as well, for some reason but maybe they were just having a bad day. Perhaps, I'll have to revisit again to sew if my experience is any different."}
{"text":"L'amour dès la première bouchée! Une cuisine originale du sud des États-Unis élaborée avec goût et créativité.  Idéale pour cette soirée de novembre en solo, la soupe au pois et jambon accompagnée de tartines de pâté de foie m'a toute suite fait sentir comme à la maison! Suivit de Brisket et rabioles aux bacons  Un menu parfait servi rapidement dans une ambiance décontractée que j'aurais pu savourer sur place ou en take-out! Un incontournable à une rue à l'ouest de la Petite Italie"}
{"text":"Pour tous les amateurs de poulet frit, rendez-vous au Dinette Triple Crown (Clark/St-Zotique). Pour emporter, sur place ou encore en pique-nique, leur poulet frit dans la sauce brune est délicieux !"}
{"text":"Came in for my first trip to Montreal....so many places to eat...yet we had no idea what to choose so we picked this place based on the review of having the best fried chicken in montreal....boy it did not disappoint!  We order 6 piece of chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens...delicious  cocktail list was impressive...order 2 shots and a beer"}
{"text":"I liked their mac n cheese. The fried chicken was also great. The portions are large. The place is situated right in front of a bus stop opposite to a park. The diner style restaurant is great for the summer. Me and my friend really enjoyed dinette triple crown."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have been to, for real. Their Mac and Cheese is so gooey and fresh. Each spoonful has cheese that hangs for a meter in length before it detaches from the rest of the Mac and Cheese. This is some seriously gooey fresh cheese! And their sides are also delicious and so is their brisket. Not only that the rum and coke was actually really well done too! The whole place is excellent and feels like you are eating a home cooked meal. Get in maaaa belly!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks, and a great concept with the picnic baskets. I'll definitely be back! Just be warned: you can't take the alcoholic drinks off the premises."}
{"text":"INCROYABLE !  J'ai adoré mon experience au Dinette ! Nous avons testé le concept de pique nique et c'etait vraiment tripant ! Le poulet frit etait sur la coche et les side dish etaient incroyable eux aussi !   Juste pour son mac n cheese ce restaurant vaut le deplacement ! Honnetement c'est mo  nouveau coup de coeur du moment   Wow"}
{"text":"If the weather is beautiful, definitely order your food to eaten outside. We can't stay away from here. We once came in 6 of us, and we're all big eaters, so we were able to order one of everything off the menu. We were completely satisfied with every single dish! The standout dishes were definitely the hush puppies, mac and cheese and pulled pork! And for the first time in my life, I had bread pudding. This is something I have never been interested in, cause the idea of bread in a pudding sounds gross. Well I happily eat my words, their bread pudding has turned me. I can never not order every time I walk in those doors. It's unfortunate how hard it is to find, and how tiny the place is considering how huge many people want to be eating there. everyone behind the counter was awesome, and the chef even lived in the south, which explains why everything tasted so authentic. definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a serious hole in the wall! You would not know it from looking at this restaurant or even ordering at the register that their food is glorious! You gotta eat here if you want a homecooked and simply splendid meal."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went here in search of biscuits. Having recently been in the US, my companions had their fill of biscuits and fried chicken and were hungry for more, but it's not a popular cuisine in Montreal. A quick Yelp search brought me to Triple Crown. We were not disappointed. Awesome service, great ambiance. Small dining room, tasty margaritas. The menu was simple, pick your meat, pick your sides. Generous portions. The chicken was crispy and delish. The mash creamy, the mac and cheese cheesy, gravy thick, and the biscuits... oh the biscuits. \"A cat's head\" she told us, in response to the \"how big are they\" question. The chef, an expert, makes hundreds and hundreds a week, by hand. Buttery to the smell and to the taste. So good one of my group put one in her purse to take home.  Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Un voyage direct vers le sud des Etats-Unis ! C'est simple, on s'y croirait ! Bien-sur on peut prendre son repas à emporter, mais je recommander d'aller s'y asseoir. Le service est vraiment au niveau. Les prix sont cohérents avec la qualité des mets.  Le buf est ultra tendre, le poulet mythique. Les sauces piquantes sont vraiment bonnes ! Les accompagnements laissent rêveur, on aimerait avoir encore de la place dans l'estomac pour goûter a davantage mais c'est déjà bien copieux !  A tester absolument !"}
{"text":"Their \"picnic basket in the park\" option is one of my favorite dining experiences in the city. Everything on their menu is delicious (don't skip dessert) and on par or better than Southern food I've had anywhere else, including the South. They get really busy at times (weekends), so it's best to call about an hour in advance. A must for anyone visiting Montreal during the summer."}
{"text":"The picnik idea is so original that it doesn't even matter what the food tastes like. This is the bees knees."}
{"text":"The food overall was really good.  Good fried chicken, good mac and cheese and ok brisket. The sides were good except for the biscuit which was just ok as well - greens, hush puppies, beans were all good.  The whiskeys were good.  Service was really good except for 1 server who was truly condescending.  She was so bad that this review went from a 4 start to a 3 star and overall left a bad taste so much so that I likely won't recommend people to go here in the future.  There is so much good food in Montreal you shouldn't have to deal with someone's attitude when you're trying to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Essayé par une froide journée automnale, j'ai redécouvers la signification de \"comfort food\". La minuscule place offre 6 places assises mais lorsqu'il fait chaud, on vous propose un panier pour aller manger dans le parc juste en face.  Mais bon, je crois qu'ils devront penser à agrandir car je prédis un grand succès à l'endroit.Le menu offre plusieurs items mais bon on y va pour le poulet frits. Croustillant,  pas du tout huileux, il se laisse déguster avec les doigts. La souper courge au cury était hallucinante et les à côtés: pains au babeurre, patates douces rissolées, salade de choux, patates pilées, tout à fait délicieux. On y sers aussi des sandwichs de porc effiloché ainsi que du brisket, mais bon, ce sera pour une autre fois. Maintenant, me reste plus qu'à essayer de reproduire leur recette de poulet car elle est disponible sur le web."}
{"text":"There are a few vegetarian option here, and they are delicious. The Mac and cheese wasn't the creamy kind Im used to but rather surprisingly and deliciously soupy; best to eat it with a spoon. The cornbread was browned on one side, which made it slightly crispy. The sweet potatoes were soft with a crunchy skin. The coke slaw was vinegary and added a nice tangy touch. Highly recommended as a place for both vegetarian and meat lovers."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling like indulging in the decadence that is Southern Cuisine, I go to Triple Crown.  You can't go wrong with the Meat & Threes. I've had just about every single combination possible and tasted every main meat dish and side dish.  My solid go to is the Brisket + hush puppies + Sweet potatoes + biscuit (although if I had a god damn spine and didn't care about being judged I would go 3x hush puppies, YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD)  The Big Nasty is also dear to my heart (but not my arteries) couple it with some hush puppies and you're golden.  Lastly, pay attention to the specials, if the meat loaf is available, DO NOT HESITATE AND TAKE IT!"}
{"text":"First off, be careful as the main restaurant isn't clearly marked.  There's a sign and an entrance into the take-out part of the restaurant that has a few counter seats, but if you go outside and enter in the door at the corner, that's where the main dining room is.  Anyway, the BBQ is really great.  I had the Brisket and it was cooked to perfection.  Yum.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was great! Rocks the taste buds! Come hear! Eat at reasonable prices! Love it!!"}
{"text":"It may be the best southern comfort food I've had. Everything we ate was delicious including the various house made sauces and non-alcoholic drinks. The fried chicken is instane."}
{"text":"We didn't stop in until our final day in Montreal, but that's probably for the best because I would've eaten ALL THE THINGS every day! I grew up in the south, and this soul food is 100% legit - truly some of the best I've ever had. I'd list off the highlights, but I wouldn't even know where to begin because everything was amazing. I ordered the 3 pc fried chicken (because I knew my bf would want a piece), which comes with 3 sides - I got collard greens, creamy cole slaw, and mashed potatoes w/ gravy. The hot sauce collection is on point. My cousin let me try a bite of her mac & cheese, and my bf let me try a bite of his brisket...all of it was pure heaven. Bloody Caesars are good and spicy, too. We stayed at an Airbnb about a block away, and I don't know how our hosts stay so skinny with this place so close. I'll be dreaming of Dinette for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is really hyped up as being amazing, so I had high expectation going in. Unfortunately, all I found it to be was just a regular meal and quite bland (except for an oddly spiced mac & cheese, which I did not like!). Perhaps the people who rave about this place have never had southern style food before and are simply experiencing something new. For anyone who is already accustomed to this type of food, the food just doesn't stack up to what true southern comfort food should be. Tried the sweet potatoes, hush puppies, mac & cheese and the fried chicken. Nothing stood out."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite experiences in Montreal was enjoying an adorable, tasty picnic lunch from Dinette Triple Crown in the park caddy-corner from their restaurant.  Highly recommend the fried chicken,"}
{"text":"This is Southern American comfort food at it's best! Perfect classic fried chicken and mac and cheese. Great for takeouts."}
{"text":"I had been hearing good reviews about this restaurant and have been wanting to check it out for a while. Luckily today, I had the chance to go.   At first, my friend and I couldn't find the place for there was no sign outside. We walked right by it. When I walked in I wasn't expecting the place to be so small. However, this made me happy. It gave it a real intimate feel. The place's decor has a 1960's diner vibe, really cool. The menus are made out of printer paper and cut out by hand. I loved it, it was simple and added authenticity to the place, along with the pickled goods and family photos on the wall. Malt shop music played in the background. It gave me such a cozy nostalgic feeling. This place is a hole in the wall and I wouldn't want it any other way. It's just a simple diner where you could grab exceptional food at a low price.  Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable regarding the menu. She explained everything in great detail, including all the sauces we had on our table; and gave us recommendations. It wasn't long before she served us their signature homemade iced tea, which was terrific.  The food is without a doubt, extraordinary. They serve original southern dishes and create flavour combinations that you will not find anywhere else in Montreal. My friend and I were getting full but were determined to finish everything on our plate, for we didn't want to waste such delicious food.  I can't wait to return and bring my boyfriend to this restaurant. There are so many other wonderful things on the menu to try. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in a heartbeat. Now, GO!"}
{"text":"A southern gem in my hometown of \"northern\" Montreal!  Fried chicken is great with kick ass home made gravy. I won't say it's the best southern fried chicken I've ever had, but hey, this is Montreal not the low country of the south or one of my faves Mrs. Wilkes in Savannah.   My kids love the Mac n' Cheese although it is a little smokey in flavour.   Biscuits are good but my absolute favourite go to are the hush puppies with ranch dressing. I'll say that I am typically not a ranch kind of guy but these are absolutely delicious.   They have some interesting mixed drinks that seem to change with the season and for those who don't drink alcohol... they have Diet Dr. Pepper!"}
{"text":"Went for Southern American comfort food on a rainy day during my Montreal vacation. The Big Nasty--an open-face sandwich with deboned fried chicken on a biscuit--was just the thing. All made more comforting by the list of Bourbon cocktails. It is a small spot. We were at the counter, though there was a communal table in the adjoining storefront. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food made from scratch and to die for!!! I felt like I was at home and well worth the wait. Great ambiance like I went back in good old souther times. Waitresses always with a smile and my belly too."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty, stuff. Heart attack inducing?  Probably, but worth it. Oh is it ever worth it.  I love the picnic baskets! What a great idea.  Pulled pork, fried chicken, hushpuppies, cornbread, so many great things. Go here."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for so long. Southern comfort food is my JAM. Fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, MAC AND CHEESE, biscuits, the menu is sublime, packed with so much goodness.   Service is really fast. I called for a pickup of five meals and the lady told me it would be ready in 15 minutes! That's hella quick! They're so nice and hospitable when they welcome you (oh that southern charm).  The food is AMAZING. Honestly, could not get any better. I loved everything I tried, and it was a lot! (mac and cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, hushpuppy)  I would order the mac and cheese without the green onions, but otherwise a very solid candidate for best mac and cheese in town."}
{"text":"I wonder if I would have given more stars if we got the picnic basket carryout? The waitress was super thorough and seemed to enjoy being there. The drinks were fantastic. The food was good but not memorable. I was only able to try a couple things because I don't eat meat. I had the mac and cheese and the cole slaw. I wouldn't make a trip back for these two items. My girlfriend enjoyed the taste of her chicken but was not used to the way it was cut. She also commented that the greens were a little bitter. I liked the selection of hot sauces and other sauces. Oh the biscuit was wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food was good. But it took nearly 25 minutes to be served, and there is no space to eat inside the restaurant. It is basically just a large space to order at the counter. But, it looks like most people who ordered there were heading out to the park across the street with the picnic baskets they give away. Pretty awesome"}
{"text":"So this was my third time here. Fried chicken always my favourite. My friend had the Big Nasty and loved it. I had the brisket. It was moist and tasty. The sides were fresh and original. Hush puppies were crunchy. The sweet potato fries had a great gravy. We also had the slaw and the bean salad. Everything was good, the chicken was awesome. The only hitch are the limited hours during week days and a little pricey. We'll go back for the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was unbelievably moist along with their homemade buns was unreal.  The chicken too is amazing."}
{"text":"Service, ambiance and great food. From us waiting for our table in the waiting area with friends drinking amazing mixed cocktails (hot butter rum drink ) to our pie at desert...could not have been better. Anyone dissing this place, comparing it to other places/experiences is just silly. It's well priced, great setting, run by professionals. People caring for their craft, loyal to their workplace. Chicken, drinks, sides, all spot on."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love their music, their seating arrangements,  their decor, the servers, and most of all their food! Love their \"Big Nasty\". Absolutely amazing,  each and every time I eat it is like the first time.  Can't get enough of it all. Also love their caramel milk shake. Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"things fried in oil can never be bad, but this place is pretty amazing. Me and my friends ordered 20 pieces of fried chicken, with a large mac and cheese, biscuits, green beans, cornbread and, fried sweet potatoes.   The Mac and cheese was quite cheesy, and had a good blend of cheese. It had an amazing umami flavour, and had an interesting profile, a delicious stink. The biscuit was crumbly, buttery goodness. The cornbread had a delicious crisp, and was packed with flavour. The fried potatoes was crunchy on the outside, soft and pack with sweetness in the inside. It was topped with a gravy.  The fried chicken was crispy, packed with flavor, and moist on the inside. Brown meat is always better than brown meat, albeit the white meat was also delicious. The gravy was a bit on the warmer side of things, but it was tasty nonetheless. Good delivery vehicle for cornbread and the biscuit.  Shoutout to the peach-Habanero hot sauce, best homemade hot sauce I've had in a while. It is quite spicy tho.  Beer's selection is short but great. They have a great cocktail selection too. I ordered a Beau's and my dining companions a bunch of Farnham's, both Canadian microbreweries."}
{"text":"Ah. I adore Dinette Triple Crown! First of all they will give you a picnic basket (yes, an actual basket) full of food and provisions so you can take your meal across the street to the park and eat there. That alone would win me over. But, the food! It is also so, so delicious.   I ordered a \"Meat and Threes\" with brisket, vinegar-based cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and corn bread. I would have never expected to get American Southern food this good so far north and in another country, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The shop itself is fairly small - just a few bar-like seats by the window. The workers are so, so nice though and they have a great-looking cocktail list, specifically the bourbon-based ones.  I'm so glad that I was able to have lunch at Dinette Triple Crown on a Sunday afternoon and partake in all this goodness with Risa."}
{"text":"Bouffe riche et délicieuse. Un service de haute qualité et chaleureux en plus. La meilleure c'est la formule pique-nique qu'il faudrait jamais abandonner.   Rich & flavourful food always. Excellent service. The picnic option must stay. A great overall experience each time.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"I love the picnic concept and i think it was adorable!  The Mcnasty: fried chicken served on a biscuit covered in their gravy. I had a bite and it was good, I enjoyed it. Mac and cheese was too watery, lacking seasoning and the cheeses they used were not the best combination. lemonade was alright, nothing worth going crazy for. mash potato was flavourless and the consistency of it was off. Not clumpy enough and not smooth enough, the gravy served with it was also bland, needs a lot more seasoning. The hush puppies came in 6, but that was 6 balls of meh. It was not good. It didnt taste like much, it was dry and needs a lot more filling because it was all bread. overall inconsistent and would not return."}
{"text":"One of the best Montreal restaurants.   If you're looking for southern comfort, this is it. Meat and threes with any of their side dishes is just delicious. Standouts are the hush puppies, buttermilk biscuits, Mac and cheese. The mains are all good but my favorite is the fried chicken. The milkshakes are all amazing and be sure to ask what the specials are. Their desserts seem to always change, but I have yet to have a bad one. Just go here. Go and eat your heart out."}
{"text":"Good option for a sunny day in Montreal! The picnic idea is very nice. Although we waited a long time to get our basket, food was tasty."}
{"text":"So this place has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and I've heard about it here and there. I was excited to try it because being from the south I love to try any southern resto in my area.   We walk in and see a tiny counter top, we are informed that we can walk outside and into the dining room. So we decide on that. The menu is a simple piece of paper with their limited options. They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.  This is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese.  3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.  At first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup.   The Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.  The fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw.   What impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their \"Derby Pie\" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it.   What didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the \"counter top\" part to pay.  I might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed."}
{"text":"Having recently been to South Carolina, home of some of the best southern food I've ever had, the food I ate tonight could have easily been at one of those restaurants. While not the best I've ever had, it was still up there. I got the three piece fried chicken, which comes with a choice of three sides. I got the mac and cheese, which counts as two, and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were very good! So buttery. Mac and cheese was different! Not your typical blander type of dish. It had a nice blend of spices. And the fried chicken was delish as well. I usually like a crispier crunchier batter, whereas this was more of a thinner batter, but it was still delicious. I got extra gravy to put on top. Yum! I will admit I loved my boy friend's pulled pork even more than the chicken, and his coleslaw was amazing! So next time I'd probably opt for the coleslaw over the mashed potatoes, and the pulled pork over the chicken. Otherwise, this meal was amazing, and I definitely recommend! Wear some stretchy pants"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation on a friend. We came here on the Saturday evening and the restaurant was quite busy so we put our name on the waiting list was told the wait would be roughly 30 minutes. We walked around and they finally gave us a call in which we waited for about 40 minutes- quite a wait for this place. When we initially arrived at the restaurant to put our name down, we found a little confusing as to where the actual restaurant was. The restaurant doesn't have a clear sign of the name of the restaurant but luckily we were able to find it. To our surprise, the place with the blue curtains with no signage was part of the restaurant. We found this out when they had our table ready for us and was directed by the staff at the main diner area to the other room.   Each of us chose the \"Meat and Threes\" which is choose one meat and three sides OR choose one meat, one Mac and cheese and one side.  My order was the brisket, Mac N Cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. Loved the mac and cheese as it was nice and creamy-cooked very nicely. Mashed potatoes was good with the gravy. For me, the brisket was a little bit underwhelming. It wasn't as tender and I felt it was cooked a tad too long as it was not moist nor juicy. The pulled pork that I had from my friend was much tastier and more flavourful- really enjoyed the tenderness and fatty pork meat. We all ordered different dishes and some different sides. Our group did communal sharing where we had a bite of everyone's food so that's the great plus on here being able to try different dishes. I also tried the fried chicken and thought it was a bit dry- it must have been overcooked as the juices seem non-existent in the chicken. I usually like my chicken more juicer and moist. If you have the chance, definitely get the Mac N Cheese which makes up for 2 sides. Overall, it was good dining experience despite some of the underwhelming dishes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and I adore their picnic concept.   During summer, you can get your food to go in a picnic basket and eat it in the park across the street and the basket, let me tell you, is absolutely adorable. It comes with a tablecloth, mason jars for water, napkins, squeeze bottles full of their homemade sauces (their BBQ sauce is out of this world, the richest BBQ sauce i've ever had).   We had two of the one meat three sides and therefore tried the fried chicken and the brisket as well as the greens, the hush puppies (they were my favourite, so flavourful and crispy), the mashed potato with gravy (so rich), the baked sweet potatoes, the corn bread and the biscuit (so flaky). We both preferred the fried chicken over the brisket, although that may be more due to personal preferences. The chicken was so crisp and very well seasoned with a nice pepper/paprika (i think) kick.   We must have eaten well over 1000 calories each but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Is it just me that doesn't have an undying appreciation of Dinette Triple Crown?  While their food is pretty good I just don't think their business model works all that well in the climate they're in.   When you head into Dinette you order for you and who you're with. You might be waiting a while to order, though.   Having the option to have three sides of your choice is a nice option but the sides are pretty scant.  Their chicken is decent but I've had much better elsewhere, and for more reasonable prices.   The food you order comes in a nice basket to eat in the park unless you're taking it to go.  There is a tiny bit of seating inside but I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't look particularly comfortable.  This is sort of where I run into some issues -- the weather in Montreal isn't always the greatest.  What do these folks do in the off season?  The gimmick extends beyond the comfort of its patrons.  TL;DR? Make sure the weather is nice before you wait in the line up."}
{"text":"Amazing place amazing service amazing food. Definitely coming back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love the concept! Get your delicious food in a picnic basket and head straight to the park across the road. Amazing sides! Only downside: It's pretty busy at certain times, especially weekends, I had to wait 40 minutes last time to get my basket."}
{"text":"OMG, this place was so good - who would guess that Montreal could do American Southern food better than most American restaurants?    I had the fried chicken dinner with collard greens, hush puppies, mac and cheese and biscuit - every single items was fantastic - the chicken was crispy yet, tender on the inside and perfectly seasoned...the hush puppies had the perfect amount of salty/sweet and the mac & cheese was very cheesy.  The place is tiny so arrive prepared or arrive early!  I really want to try the brisket next time..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cute picnic concept, and lovely staff.   The fried chicken is one of the best I've ever had. The seasoning is perfect, the skin in crisp, and the chicken is nice and juicy (except for one piece). Also, it doesn't leave you feeling greasy as fried chicken typically does for me.   The side dishes were also great and authentic. The mac and cheese was tangy and cheesy (and the serving was huge). The sweet potatoes were also perfectly caramelized and soft. My mom enjoyed the biscuits, collard greens, and green beans.   The day we went had the most amazing weather for a picnic, slight breeze and clear sky. That made eating the food even better, definitely recommend.   The cashier was one of the most friendly people I have met in Montreal, and explained the concept and food very well and in detail. He even chatted with us while we waited.   What made it even better was when we returned, there was a line out the door that we were able to miss!"}
{"text":"Despite my disdain for the South's more \"yikes\"-ish tendencies when it comes to basic socioeconomic issues (especially in light of recent events), the region's food always makes me able to at least halfway forgive them for a finite period of time (and that says a lot). Unlike most white American traditional home cooking, which I find to be quite bland for my tastes more often than not, Southern food delivers up some stick-to-your-ribs comfort that will always leave you longing for more. Given Montréal's track record of not being the best in American joies-de-vivre such as pizza, macaroni and cheese, barbecue, and bagels (fight me on this one); I was quite surprised and hopeful in stumbling upon this place. I'm pleased to say it wildly exceeded my expectations.  Immediately after walking in, I was surrounded by a cozy and rustic interior that made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside, especially coupled with the friendly and inviting waiters. After deciding to sit at the bar, I ordered a meat and three with pulled pork, mac and cheese (you can sub mac and cheese for two sides), and candied yams. I can honestly say that it was one of the most food-gasmic meals I've ever had. The pulled pork was fall-apart-in-your-mouth tender and a far cry from most of my experiences with Westerners cooking pork in a rather dry manner; plus it went well with the (actually decently spicy!) peach chile-something spicy sauce that I drizzled on every bite. It brought a somewhat tart and slightly citrus-y dimension to the meat. The candied yams could have been delightful just on their own as I am a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but the sweet sauce that carries notes of brown sugar made sweet and savory a dream made in heaven. And the mac and cheese was the most cheesy, naughty, and melty dish that I've had in a long time, with the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. It harbored a mix of different cheeses including cheddar and bleu, if I'm correct, and the breadcrumb crust on top that signalled the fact that it was baked sealed the deal for me.   Although I was full by the time I was done, I couldn't resist trying one of their desserts because of how well Southerners make them. The creamy Atlantic Beach Pie was on the menu for the day, and according to NPR, it originated on the North Carolina coast. Made with a combination of lemon and lime flavors with a sweet and salty crust and a whipped cream topping, it further justified my affinity for fruit-based desserts and how I could eat them for eternity. Overall, the entire meal was luscious but unpretentious, and I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone who wants homey comfort food or even for a cozy date night. I can't wait to come back and try some of their drinks and especially their famous fried chicken to see how it stacks up against my favorite international variant (Korean)!"}
{"text":"Mmm-mm! Southern comfort food and soul food!  I'm gonna start off with a pretty unpopular opinion: the fried chicken here isn't that great. I find it over-spiced and not that crispy, and the gravy does nothing for me, either. So while I love fried chicken and I certainly wouldn't turn this stuff down if it was offered, it's not what I'll spend money on here.  The quality of the rest of the food, however, more than makes up for it. The mac & cheese changed my life (a \"large\" serving is pretty large, too). The collard greens made me think I'd died and gone to heaven. The cornbread brought tears to my eyes and the hushpuppies (and the sauce they're served in) were positively orgasmic. The desserts and cocktails are amazing. Next on my \"to-try\" list is the pulled pork.  The size of the \"dining room\" is both a big pro and a big con at Triple Crown. There's only seating for about 3.5 people inside, and this space disappears when it gets crowded, which is every nice evening in the summer. Triple Crown offers an amazing take-away package of a wicker picnic basket, cutlery, checked table cloth, sauces, and your drinks sealed up in mason jars so that you can take it all to the lovely little park across the street, which is as awesome as it is picturesque in nice weather. However, there is a finite supply of these and if you come after 7pm on a nice summer's eve, you will not only be waiting in line for a long time, you will be forced to take your meal to-go, sans picnic basket or sauces. That being said, the line is probably worth it and you can always order for delivery."}
{"text":"Great food! Great location and atmosphere! There were great portion sizes! The only change I would make would be to update the furniture and restroom.  Do yourself a favour and order the hush puppies"}
{"text":"If you are looking for orgasmic-ally delicious food, DTC is the place. Everything about this place is great. Awesome food, Great cocktails, Friendly service &  Reasonable price.        This place looks like a family run diner from the 20's and they have classic 20's music playing in the background (How long blues - Anthony b, I dream of lilac time - Jeannine.....etc).       We ordered the Big Nasty, The daily special \"Pork belly\", Hushpuppies, Mac & Cheese and the fried chicken. We also ordered milkshakes, and couple cocktails. The milkshakes & the cocktails were really great. The big nasty is Deep fried chicken between biscuits topped with gravy. It hits the right spots instantly.The hushpuppies are delish...... Deep fried & crispy. The Mac and cheese....Oh Yeah. Its just perfectly done.  Can't wait to go back to this place next week to try other things on their menu.  Food - Awesome Service - Freindly Ambiance - Homely & Cozy Worth the money - Awwwww Yeeaaahh"}
{"text":"K. That was absolutely the most romantic hour of my day, of my, well, ...in a very long time. I am as shamelessly hopeful as they come. And though I am seriously working on jading up, I don't think I was the only one in the mid-day line-up for a picnic-basket-lunch feeling the power and camaraderie of Friday, of sun, of tree greenery spring, of warmth, and satiating healthy appetites with good food, drink, and lovingly crafted Bourbon!    It started with me not writing down the exact address for the Eastern Bloc on Clark, not easily spotting it while in the vicinity, realizing I was really hungry, winding up locking the bike aside the Parc du la Petite Italie, wholly focused on the quest for the 'right' nourishments, spotting several picnickers with baskets of food and drink on red & white checkered table cloths, asking about, then being pointed toward, the source.   And discreet it is. No indication, outwardly, that something really special is going on. Until you get closer.   No signage on the building nor in the window. But the height-of-lunch lineup and the buzz in DTC's small lunch takeout kitchen-side section was furious for the next 30 mins(?).  By the time I'd gotten to the counter, ordered, waited outside. waited inside, chatted with Nicole about the circa 1970's race horse photos (spent many a summers eve and weekend at Assiniboin Downs in the late 60's), about Victoria BC, MTL transplanting, and my chicken was cooked, (whew...still with me, it was a good wait! =D) the lunch frenzy had subsided and I had to get back to work. So I didn't eat in the park, and took my brown bagged (fried spicy chicken, roasted sweet potato, with a very interesting side of sauce) lunch home.   Half way through our conversation I learn Nicole is an owner of this biz. Jeez, she had the biggest smile the whole while she was co working it!  This is a sincere labour of big big love. So beautiful.   Lunch was excellent. I will go back.   Plan the time. This is not fast food fare.   Next time I will include both park time, and a beautiful bourbon elixir, or two.  And, perhaps, a friend.   Pretty special.  Do the DTC park picnic lunch in Little Italy thing and let yourself -eyes wide open- have this extraordinary robust moment of Montreal romance. =D  Cheers, Tammy M"}
{"text":"Iam a pro at making mac & cheese and my friends and relatives know that BUT ive never had mac & cheese as cheesy, flavourful like the one from dinette triple crown. Cant wait for warmer days so i can take advantage of their picnic baskets. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a fantastic dinner here. We couldn't get seating at the main restaurant and ended up sitting next door at the take out. We had the 3 piece chicken with hush puppies, mashed potato, biscuit and a small macaroni and cheese. Everything was delicious. The waitress and server were very friendly. We will definitely go back. Note: there is only permit parking in the area"}
{"text":"In the years before I moved to Montreal, I lived mostly in Kansas and Texas. One thing that drives me crazy about Montreal is that I can never find any decent Tex-Mex or southern dives (no, 3 Amigos doesn't count, nor does serving a melted block of cheese in a bowl and calling it \"chile con queso\"). This place exceeded expectations. I've had my fair share of Louisiana and South-east fare when I was in Texas, and this place encompasses both culinary traditions. Food: Triple Crown Dinette gives you the tapas option of ordering a bunch of sides and chowing down. My favorite option is the \"meat and three\" option - choose a meat (smoked brisket, pulled pork, fried chicken), and choose 3 sides (this includes a vast array of mouthwatering options, including buttermilk biscuits, cornbread, hushpuppies, collard greens, black eyed peas, cole slaw, and the most succulent fried sweet potatoes you've ever tasted). They also have quite a compelling beverage list - I chose a Bloody Caesar and was not disappointed. My friend ordered the brownie for dessert, and according to her, it was decadent. Sauce (yes, it needs its own category): I think the best thing about this place is the plate of jars and bottles that line the small dining area. I think there are 7 different sauces that you can use for your food - chile vinegar hot sauces, some sort of delicious BBQ sauce, and of course, the peach habañero salsa. The food is already delicious on its own, but this additional step to dressing the food really brings the dish to a whole new level. Atmosphere: With pickling vegetables in jars lining the wall cabinets of this cozy space, the restaurant is a casual yet warm and intimate setting. The kitchen is open to the dining area and you can smell the scents of foodstuffs wafting out while the chefs prepare your food. A word to the wise: this place is quite small, and the only tables are bar-style and lined along the walls. Make a reservation or get there early to get some good seats. As an alternative, I believe they also do carry-out orders. All in all, great place. I've been back a couple times with my friends (one who is from both Georgia and Alabama) and we are never disappointed. If you're a from the South and are feeling slightly jaded in this Northern city that offers little in the sense of Southern cuisine, give this place a visit."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended so we went for a group dinner. The prices came out to $30 a head just for the main meal, drinks and dessert were extra. For that price we really looked forward to some authentic southern bbq. The chicken and pulled pork were just \"alright\", the mash potatoes and coleslaw was sub par. Only the biscuits and salad were above average. The drinks were pretty good but $8 each. The pecan pie was great, but lemon mirangue was the worst I ever had. Oh and they have no coffee. In conclusion this place is overhyped and overpriced. It doesn't compete with BBQ in the southern US and for $120 for 2 people we could have gorged on the best sushi in town. So don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Enfin! C'est fait, j'ai goute a la cuisine du Tripple crown. Je dirais le concept est meilleur que le gout, ca reste bon! Les HushPuppies sont malade avec la petite sauce blanche, un incontournable! Le dessert etait incroyable: tarte au babeurre et citron, creme fouette et coulis de bleuet, wow! Le reste etait bien, mais sans plus.   Le service A1 et rapide, le panier Pic nik etait parfait et franchement j'ai adore le concept! Je vais y retourner pour essayer autre chose, comme le boeuf!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Walking in here is like stepping into the a old southern dinette! It's so cute, cozy and homey! They have jars of pickled veggies along the wall and the drinks menu is up on the wall behind the counter.   I came here with hubby and the kids. Although they were super friendly and nice it's not very kid friendly since the seating is tall swivel chairs at a counter.   But my kids love this place and fought over the last piece of fried chicken as well as the mashed potato and sweet potatoes. They liked the hush puppies too but loved the the other too.   The fries chicken was perfectly fries so tender and well spiced without being greasy! Hubby got the pulled pork which he refused to share it was so good.   The seating area is tiny but last time we were there they said they were expanding and would have a larger seating area soon woohoo!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wicked concept. You get a basket of food with all the provisions to picnic in the park. Hella cute.   They also have an indoor dining space that's super cool vibes and there's plenty of room for a big group.  It is American comfort food so don't expect anything light. Just don't even come if that's what you want.   Everything is good. My pick is the brisket. Give it to me, don't stop,.want more, can't get enough.   Greens can be better. Still love you but, real talk.   Mac and cheese was a crowd pleaser.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best part about my experience with Dinette Triple Crown was the picnic basket! What a great idea! During summer time, you can order your food to go in a picnic basket and eat in the park across the street. The basket is complete with picnic table cloth, sauces, mason jar water cups and utensils. Just return everything to the restaurant when you're finished.  My personal favorite is the brisket. But their fried chicken and pulled pork are amazing as well! The cider goes great with southern comfort food. :)"}
{"text":"Quel bonne idée pour manger bon et dehors avec le petit parc juste à coté ! En effet on vous propose de pouvoir prendre un panier avec tous le nécessaire (couvert, assiette, sauce, eau et verre). Au niveau de la carte nous avons vraiment aimé ce que nous avons commandé ! Le principe de prendre 3 à coté est un réel plus car on peut goûter à plusieurs choses, surtout si on partage à plusieurs ;-) Aussi bien la viande que les à coté sont bons. En plus nous étions venus avec des amis venant de France et ca nous à permit aussi de passer un repas typique d'Amérique du nord dans un parc sympa, que demander de plus :) Ca me donne envie de revenir pour tester cette fois ci les breuvages maisons et d'autres à coté qui donnaient aussi envie ! Je vous le conseille pour le concept !"}
{"text":"Once again my Yelp family came through. Each city I travel I always like to try their soul food to see how it varies from at home and luckily, DTC was a winner. I came on a Saturday afternoon and seen there was a line out the door. Not knowing this was for to-go orders only,  I waited and listened to what other people were ordering  (Lol). There is another door to the L for dine-in customers. Most people placing to-go orders were doing what's called a Picnic package where you order the foos, all the items are placed in to-go containers to include silverware, etc. and placed in a picnic basket. You can then walk across the street to find an open picnic table and enjoy your meal and drink outside at the park. I LOVED this idea. And actually more people were doing this than dining inside.    On the other side is the small-spaced dining area of picnic type tables that seats about 30-35 people. The waitress brought a food and cocktail menu. To drink I tried the Briar Patch which consisted of bourbon,  chile and some other ingredients. It had a spicy kick to it but surprisingly was pretty good. The food choices is one meat and 3 sides.  My mind was set on the brisket but the waitress recommended the fried chicken so I went with that instead. The sides I chose were braised greens and maac n cheese. FYI, mac n cheese counts as 2 sides. The food was brought out about 10 minutes later and looked delicious.   They have on each table 6 different sauces which consisted of a tomato-based, South Carolina mustard (tangy), Habanero, Jalapeno, Memphis BBQ and a yellow-ish one that was the hottest of them all. I tried all 6 and my favs were the SC mustard mixed with the jalapeno. So good. The food was one of the best meals I'd had in Montreal. I'm glad I went with the fried chicken because it was juicy,  flavorful and the outer part was very crisp. I literally ate down to the bone! The greens and mac were good as well but the chicken stole the show. The dessert options were blueberry pie and s chocolate walnut rum something. Both sounded good but I was too stuffed to eat another bite of anything. This is one place I will definitely come back to when I visit again. The staff were all nice and very attentive and the food again was really good!  Kudos"}
{"text":"Cozy place, awesome food. Can't wait to go back and bring family visiting town next month"}
{"text":"Un petit stop rapide que je ne regretta pas du tout malgré les constructions de la rue. J'ai eu du mal à voir le resto au début car il n'y a pas d'affiches ou de noms que j'ai remarqué.  La salle était pleine et le comptoir prêt à emporter aussi. Le comptoir est décoré de bouteilles et de pots massons de produits maisons. On a la vue directe sur la cuisine, les propriétaires n'ont rien à cacher et tout à montrer. Ça crée une ambiance conviviale, chaleureuse.  L'accueil, la nourriture, le décor et la musique te font sentir ailleurs. J'ai vite oublié le froid Montréalais et j'ai eu du plaisir à analyser les milles et unes décorations et installations sur les murs.  Le poulet frit et la purée de pommes de terre étaient un bon repas rapide."}
{"text":"Food are nice and creative. The way they run the restaurant is very smart. However, it is too chill to sit outside for me. So I chose to sit inside which is too crowded. The chicken was fin, i only eat the skin. The gravy was fine. Everything is normal"}
{"text":"I really liked it. The staff is available to help. If you wanna eat in the Park, you can ask for the picnic basket. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have found a better place to celebrate Thanksgiving in Montreal.  It is a bit off the beaten path if you are taking public transit, but well worth the journey!  Le big nasty was the best fried chicken sandwich I have ever eaten. The chicken was moist with crunchy and perfectly seasoned skin.  The biscuits were flaky and cooked to order and the gravy was to die for.  They do not hold back.  It is Enough to feed 2.   The sides and the sauces were delicious as well.  Loved the vinegar slaw and habanero BBQ sauce.  The other star of the show was the pumpkin bread pudding with fresh whip cream.  I am not a big dessert person and I battled my fiancé for the last bite."}
{"text":"I went to this place a couple of times.  They do picnic baskets that you could bring with you to the parc which is really cute. This place gets really good reviews, and I think it's mostly due to the picnic aspect of it.  The food is good, but nothing spectacular.  I've had the mac and cheese twice which is quite amazing, but other than that the fried chicken  is not the best I've had, unlike most reviews here, the hush puppies are just okay, and the biscuits were quite disappointing."}
{"text":"The service was awesome! The spicy drink was awesome! The food was awesome! I really enjoyed the bottles of sauces on the table, homemade and delicious. The set up of the eating areas were cool. The blues music playing in the background was on point. The price is what you expect from Montreal. Great experience and I will return."}
{"text":"Some pretty incredible southern food! It's kind of ironic that it's located up north! Go figure! It's really perhaps the best we've had anywhere, even in the south! The owners who are super sweet and friendly are from Kentucky however. One of the owners sister actually lives not too far from where I'm from which was kind of neat! Really such a small world, isn't it?   Everything is made from scratch including those sinful hush puppies drenched in creamy dill drizzle. O. M. G. Hubs said the double fried chicken was total perfection. Perfectly creamy mashed potatoes, baked mac and cheese, down home flavored cornbread, big, flaky homemade buttery biscuits and a variety of house made sauces to taste and play with. Wow. Don't come thinking about your waistline and you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself!   The drinks were fantastic as well. The \"Dark & Stormy\" was one of the best I've ever had. It was made with their house ginger beer and bitters which I think made all the difference. Delish! I loved the partially open kitchen and bar! Our bartender was also a gem of guy!   The immediate space isn't too large. Counter seating, but oh so cozy. Perfect southern notes such as burlap covered walls, chalkboard signage and Mason jars. There's also a big front window which we were able to catch a lovely, romantic pink sunset from! Bonus!   There is another large dining room next door actually, with communal farmhouse style table. (See my photo) The spot next door, just to the left of the main entrance is also where the restrooms are located, is candle lit and dark. Perfect really. Loved the vibes as well as the vintage racing horse photos. Probably a nod to their Kentucky (Derby) roots. Love it!   You can see the care and thought that went into, and continues to go into the menu, space and ingredients. For instance, the restaurant flew up candy roaster seeds which are indigenous to the south and grew the variety of squash here in Quebec just for their seasonal pies! That's speaks volumes to me.   After you've had your fill of poutine and other traditional Montreal  nosh, COME HERE!! I know it seems like kind of an odd place to eat while in this region, but seriously, don't miss it! Hubs does not give out 5 stars generously and this was without question, an absolute 5 star experience!   Fantastic service, taste, quality and all around feel.   Oh, and they pack their food in baskets for you to picnic across the street in the park! So sweet!"}
{"text":"Just an update because my old review had out of date info - Dinette has now extended into the room next door which gives them a bunch more tables, and they've got there liquor license and are serving up incredibly delicious cocktails.   You can and should order a picnic to go and if you do this, don't be ridiculous, please call in your order in advance. Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals."}
{"text":"It was Victoria Day weekend and the weather was hot so my boyfriend and I decided to come here as a recommendation from a local and get a basket and have a picnic. What an awesome concept this place has!   We ordered the beef brisket, fried chicken, hushpuppies, veggies and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is to DIE FOR. The cashier recommended it and said we would not regret it. The only thing I regret is not getting a bigger size or another tray! The basket came with everything needed: plates, cutlery, a jar of iced water, napkins and three types of sauces: sweet, mustard and vinegar flavoured. I loved the mustard and vinegary sauces.    The staff is quite lovely as well. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken.  I usually don't eat any deep fried stuffs, but today I decided to give this place a try. Best choice ever! I ordered the two pieces of chicken with Mac and cheese and slaw and a gravy. OMG the gravy is to die for!!! Absolutely the best! The chicken is tender and crisp.  The coleslaw was a good balance too  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The concept is very cool. You get a basket of food and then you go picnic in the adjacent park. Also the restaurant itself has some \"ambiance\" to it, and everyone working there is very nice.  Yet, I probably won't go there a second time because the food was not particularly of great quality, and quite expensive for what it was.   We were four, so we tried several dishes: The chicken, the pulled pork, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was already cold and hard when I opened the basket (3 minutes after receiving the basket). At 14$ (+tax +tip) the Mac and Cheese contained some really cheap cheese that I found didn't smell right. The pulled pork was just fine.  Now, maybe this is all just one instance of bad experience and/or maybe I don't like the southern food. But I came out from there pretty disappointed, and pretty disappointed about being pretty disappointed, because I had heard a lot of good things about Triple Crown and I was predisposed to love the place..."}
{"text":"Pros: - Easy to find street parking  - Restaurant side was cosy & well heated - Menu is simple to order from  - Plate sharing - Friendly wait staff  Cons:  - Tables quite high so a small kid would have his plate probably at the level of his mouth...which is not a bad thing given how good the food is, he could just shovel the food right in!  :p  We ordered the amers & soda, brisket, mac'n cheese, hushpuppies, fried sweet potatoes as a side and a custard pie and that was quite good for 2 people.    I think the fried sweet potatoes were the most wondrous thing that I've had in a while!   Sweet potato cubes fried on the outside with a crispy caramelized outer layer with a soft and sweet inside. Covered in a delightful savory sauce and sprinkled with green onions.  Then there's the hushpuppies, which is fried cornbread dough with onions inside and a nice fried dry exterior. It's prefect because is not loaded with grease. Served with a chive ranch sauce. It's slightly sweet flavor is balanced with the ranch.  These two sides are a MUST HAVE!!   TIP: If you get the brisket you have to eat it first because it dries out fast! When it's hot, it is juicy and tender.   Mac'n cheese was with Scooby Doos and cooked to al dente smothered with a thick cheese & beer sauce and gratiné. It's a little heavy so best to share.  Ok The pie had a very crispy crust, a lemony flavor in the custard and two slices of preserved peaches. It was yummy :)"}
{"text":"I love that this place does picnic baskets that you can take out to the park and eat then return the basket later - very creative, cute, and unique... Especially given the lovely parks that montreal has during summer.   This time we ate at the actual restaurant which was nice and rustic feeling. I found that the food was good, very clean, very good quality seeming ingredients, the fried chicken was tasty and not greasy at all- I didn't feel the way I do after eating KFC (even though I like the taste of KFC more flavour-wise) but this chicken was something that you could imagine being served in a country BnB.. I did find that the food was a bit dry, however we went in a huge group (20 people) and I would bet that it was likely only slightly dry because of the wait/prep time for handing the huge group.   I would definitely be down for trying out one of their adorable picnic basket lunches to take to a park one day."}
{"text":"KFC? Popeyes? Grocery store fried chicken? No. Nononono.  TRIPLE CROWN.   Tip my hat to that kitchen team because that was one mind blowing food experience. The fried chicken is flawless. It's a very flavorful batter - something very distinct about it, similar to KFC but more flavorful and more addicting.  I chose some elaborate sides which I think clashed against the chicken, aside from the sweet potatoes which were ace. I also tried the Mac and cheese, which was delicious. The biscuit was a little bit of a miss for me, but I didn't care.  It's the chicken and that sauce that matters."}
{"text":"On a adoré notre expérience ! Le concept est tout simplement génial! Comme l'endroit est surtout un comptoir pour commander et emporter à la maison, ils offrent la possibilité de commander des paniers de pique-nique que tu emportes dans le parc au coin de la rue et tu peux manger tout en étant dehors et en passant un bon moment! Ça vient même avec les couverture carreautée! JE CAPOTE !!  De plus, le poulet frit est DÉLICIEUX! Vraiment!! tous les à-côtés aussi d'ailleurs ! De plus, le prix (excluant la bière mettons..) est vraiment raisonnable pour la quantité de bouffe que tu as!  Je le suggère amplement surtout durant la saison estivale!"}
{"text":"While yelping places to eat in Montreal, I did not expect this one to be as highly rated as it was. I'm from Texas, and highly rated southern food from up north is not what I'd expect.  But I was so wrong. After we walked around for a little bit trying to find the place, we finally found a very busy, small storefront. We managed to grab two little seats at the bar where we and my boyfriend ate. Considering the place was so busy, service was very friendly and quick.  My boyfriend had the \"Big Nasty\" which was so big, he could not finish it. I had the Meat and threes with some fried chicken, fried sweet potatoes, and little mac and cheese. The chicken was not too greasy and the sides were heavenly. I had a ginger beer to wash it all down with, and I felt like I was back in the US on vacation in the south.  While we were eating, people were picking up picnic baskets to go eat their food at the park, and coming back with their dishes. Seriously, this would not happen in the States. Dinette Triple Crown is extremely charming, and has done southern comfort food right."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and a very quaint atmosphere! A little tough to find but worth the search. It's one of my favorite neighborhoods in Montreal and we will for sure be back for more delicious food!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me on this.   Had the opportunity of sampling some of their Crispy fried chicken at an Elite event along with collard greens and hush puppies. The fried chicken was moist n crispy but as far as flavour goes it was nothing wow amazing! Collard greens were good not too salty nor over powered with butter. Hush puppies were okay just like fried cornbread.  What really topped the cake for me was the sauce offering on the table that ranged from a mustard to a spicy one to a vinegar based not that helped awaken the flavours of the chicken. You can slather as much of that stuff on till your Heart is content.   The inside of the restaurant is somewhat small so they came up with the Ingenious idea to offer a picnic basket so you can take your souther food into the park. Very  clever to offer this up to give a great experience. Decor is old fashioned music is that old southern music to help support the dining experience.   I thought the food was good but not knock your socks off wow! I will come back after another visit to update the review from testing other items."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic southern comfort food you won't be disappointed. Everything i got was delicious from the buttery biscuits, crispy chicken to the creamy mac and cheese. I suggest ordering the food to go that way you can eat at the nearby park. They will pack everything in a lovely picnic basket complete with plates, napkins etc... What a neat concept!  I can't wait to go back to try some of their other sides such as the hushpuppies and mashed potatoes with gravy.   I just have to warn you of the wait though, I waited about 45 minutes to get my order but it didn't matter anymore as soon as I started eating!"}
{"text":"Conseillé par Yelp, approuvé par nous! Une place que j'ai yelpé pour manger un bout avant d'aller rejoindre la team Yelp à Abada Capoiera. Le concept est super: Un choix de viande pour 3 choix d'accompagnements (pour les grosses faims) ou à la carte ce que vous voulez (pour picorer). Il y avait tout ce qu'on voulait, j'ai adoré les Hushpuppies, le porc effiloché un peu trop pimenté mais pour ceux qui en veulent plus il y a plein de sauces épicées, le poulet pané bon, les patates douces un peu trop sucrées, la salade de choux bonne, les légumes braisés bons... Le choix de bières est excellent avec la Farnham et la Bierbrier je crois, toutes les deux bonnes, le service souriant... Et quand nous sommes sorti à 19h le resto était bondé intérieur comme extérieur (le côté à emporter remporte un franc succès)! Bonne enseigne très certainement, merci Yelp pour ce bon conseil!"}
{"text":"Who knew that some of best southern food I've ever had would be in Montreal OUTSIDE of the United States!  Many locals recommended this spot, so trusting the locals thinking what does a Canadian know about Southern cooking?  I learned while eating my fried chicken that the chef/ Owner IS from the South, Kentucky to be exact, and knows what authentic southern food is supposed to taste like. Just like the south service was super friendly.  The place is tiny with bar seating  I lucked out and found a seat at the counter."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in town, great food great drinks great service great people.  Fried chicken is spiced properly and has a good texture, the homemade sauces are awesome, the side dishes are amazing and the desserts to die for."}
{"text":"Are you hungry? But, like, are you really hungry? Well stop searching, this is where you're going.  The food was amazing, the food is always amazing (been three times already). This is some of the best soul/comfort food I have ever have the pleasure to put in my mouth. The chicken is simply perfect, the mac-and-cheese is out of this world, and pretty much all the sides are fantastic (hushpuppies, sweet potatoes and THE GODDAMN BISCUIT gets a honorable mention).   The service was also very on point. The waitress' have always been very laid back and extremely knowledgeable about every single item on the menu. Great service.  There's a lot I can't even talk about, I'm not a big drinker but their drink selection is extraordinary, and I also heard about the dummer picnic baskets, how amazing?  I guess I'll just have to go back!"}
{"text":"Great, perhaps the best fried chicken I've ever had. It's brined, buttermilk marinated and heavily spiced. It was perfectly hot and stayed hot throughout my first couple of pieces. Also you get a lot of chicken...10 pieces for $25.00. The gravy is good too, and I enjoyed the cole slaw.  The service is extremely friendly. We ate at the second, take-out counter location they have just past the first full sized restaurant on the corner. It's a more casual dining environment.  They have a good beer and bourbon selection as well. We also shared a piece of green tomato pie which tasted like apple pie. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Best fried chicken!  The sweet potato side was absolutely delish.  The mac and cheese was rich and super tasty.  I couldn't drink, but the homemade lemonade was very well done.  Honestly, best meal I have had in a while.  I was super full by the end but brought home the chocolate bourbon pie and that did not disappoint either; very rich and generous on the bourbon!  Great meal from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from texas and this place is by far the best southern resturant I've been to. Everything here is great."}
{"text":"This place honestly is AMAZING. Love the idea of a takeout picnic basket. I'm sure as everyone has said the basket comes with everything you could need. We got the pulled pork + 3 sides and I have to say it was one of the best pulled pork dishes I've had in MTL.  The wait is pretty long and there's usually a line. But hey, that's just a testament to the quality of the food. Definitely recommend to try"}
{"text":"Was looking so forward to eat there since my son enjoys it and the revue. What a let down my chicken was dry, my creamy colswaw was not creamy, hushpuppys dry and tasteless and there spécial side order of green beans romano and bacon should have been called muchie stewed can beans. My son days i must have went on a bad  day . Bad day or not i will never go back food tasted like the place looks awful"}
{"text":"Being from Charleston, whenever I see \"Southern food\" elsewhere, I'm skeptical. But the food Dinette Triple Crown is delicious. We had a meat + 3 to share: fried chicken (good but not great), with mashed potatoes, collards (with kale, though), and biscuits, all spot-on. They have a variety of BBQ sauces on the tables, including East Carolina vinegar and SC mustard varieties.    (I do wish they offered a vegetable plate - just a choice of three or four sides. Sometimes all you want is the sides!)  Service was friendly. The place is small, with counter seating for maybe eight people. It's getting a bit cold for the picnic basket option, but I think they have a bigger room off to the side? It looked that way, but not sure.  I will be visiting on a monthly basis for a taste of home. They have a Big Nasty sandwich that I look forward to trying and comparing to Hominy Grill's version. I'll also be trying the Mac and cheese and maybe a cocktail (they've got old timey choices like an Arnold Palmer or Sazerac)."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVOURITE spot in Montreal. I love the staff, the vibe, and of course, the delicious food. You can tell they put so much care in everything they do. Truly a wonderful experience each and every time."}
{"text":"Finally, finally we managed to organize ourselves and enjoy the amazing food of Dinette Triple Crown in the Little Italy park. It is actually pretty easy and the idea is outstanding. You go in the little bar section, order your food and come to pick up your basket. They will give you a number and shout it out when the basket is filled with goodies in approximately 30 minutes on a relatively busy day. Ideally you have to attack one of the picnic tables in the park, otherwise make sure to have a blanket with you. BYOB is ok in the park, but you can buy beer in the restaurant or the near by deppaneur. Unfortunately the Dinette cocktails are available only in the dining room and you can't have them in the basket.   The basket has everything about quality picnic: table cloth, plastic dishes, cutlery, water and little jars to poor your drink, which is handy if you have forgotten to bring plastic cups. The most important part of course is the food. I got lucky to taste the Dinette food more then a year ago during an Yelp event and I knew how essential is to come back. Delicious comfort food, fried chicken to die for, love the hush puppies, the corn bread, sweet potato fries, the pulled pork is amazing. The concept is so simple and succesfull, you order chicken or pulled pork with two or three sides. The list of sides is pretty good and they always have few seasonal specials.   People who don't live in this city should know that Montreal has a park culture, the same way the Irish have a pub culture etc. That night at the little stage of the park we enjoyed the rhythms of the Brazilian samba and people were dancing to it. To summarize we had a typical Montreal experience: Southern American food in a park called Little Italy in the background of Brazilian music (citation NLM) and I'm so excited about it that need to share this review imeediately. Of course most of my excitement is because of the delicious food of Dinette Triple Crown."}
{"text":"So I think I kinda possibly maybe love this place. Yes I know it's a southern diner in Canada of all places. And not just Canada, but Montreal, The North American answer to France; but something just feels right.   Dinette triple crown transports you to a different place and time. If the menu wasn't in French, you would have thought you fell asleep and woke up in Tennessee circa 1956. The diner theme is perfectly executed.   And how would I rate our friends from the north's interpretation of southern fare? Pretty damn good!   -Fried chicken: Very respectable fried chicken, well seasoned and juicy. Plenty of sauces to accompany (i recommend the peach habanero and the Memphis BBQ).   -Mac and cheese: huge serving of piping hot Mac, with extra cheese sauce all topped off with bread crumbs. Maybe a tad bit of salt would have put it over the top but it is Quite satisfying, and better than most.   -buttermilk biscuit: save the best for last. I like to think of myself as a biscuit connoisseur . As much as I love them, id say most are mediocre at best. This is easily inserted into the top 3 I have ever consumed. Warm, Flaky, buttery, soft, moist. There is absolutely nothing that can make this biscuit any better. This is how it should be done.   It is worth mentioning that you of course get to hospitality that the Canadians are known for, as that only adds to the overall experience.  This southern American has been won over......"}
{"text":"I didn't understand what comfort food meant until I ate here on a cold winter's eve around closing time.  If you eat here, prepare to require assistance to walk out the door again.  You may need to be wheeled out.  The Triple Crown Dinette formerly consisted of a kitchen and a small antechamber with a few swivel seats and a wraparound counter.  Thankfully they've expanded into a larger dining room, however the two are only connected by the kitchen. While staff can flit between the curtains, regular patrons must exit the front door and reenter through another door.  I ordered the small Mac and Cheese, with deep fried sweet potatoes and ancho pepper mayo, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Of course, I also had the strawberry milkshake :D.  I've had several Mac and Cheese dishes in my lifetime, and this is undoubtedly the best one.  Sorry to my friends at Kraft, Le Cheese, Fortune, Deville, and EVOO, but the richness of flavour here is unbeatable.  The noodles are cooked just right, the creamy sauce is tasty, not just generically creamy, not too fatty.  The cheese on top is baked to just the right degree, not burnt to a crisp, leaving a beautiful caramel brown colour in just the right places (thank you to the Maillard reaction!).  This is no one-trick pony either, I've been back on a few other occasions, and they've consistently impressed me with this dish.  Those who know me know I don't like potatoes, but I love sweet potatoes, so when I heard \"deep-fried sweet po...\" I don't think I even let the server finish the sentence before shouting \"Yes!\".  Ancho mayo was a new one for me, though, so I looked it up.  \"Ancho\" is another name for the Poblano pepper, a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico.  The sweet potatoes were delicious on their own, but the mayo's spiciness provided a nice balance to the sweetness.  I've never had a buttermilk biscuit before either, and I was in for a treat!  The outside was slightly crunchy, the texture reminiscent of a fresh scone, and the inside was a wonderful blend of salty-sour butter and milk flavour.  I was barely able to finish the biscuit, I had to take half of the rest to go, except for the fact that I couldn't move for a good 10 minutes.  The only negative is that the strawberry milkshake was uninspiring, perhaps my expectations were too high given the level of the salted caramel variant here.  I probably spent 20 minutes trying to finish the meal (and failing), and another 20 minutes endeavouring to move again.  It was worth it!"}
{"text":"Finally i got a chance to enjoy DTC picnic basket meal. My order was a meat + 3 - fried chicken + 3 sides (Mashed potatoes n gravy, hushpuppies and cornbread)  Note: In the summertime the wait is hella long, my 45 minute wait became an hour wait, patience chile should be your mantra!  The fried chicken, though good, was not crispy enough for my liking, it lacked the crunchiness I crave. However, my 3 sides were the showstoppers! Hushpuppies with the sauce is amazing. I am guessing they are dipped in chickpea flour batter. The cornbread was warm and went well with the gravy.The gravy here is a nice peppery kind with the right amount of thickness and consistency.  I wish there were more places like this which have a picnic basket option."}
{"text":"Quelle premièere expérience. J'ai souvent entendu parler de la dinette, et j'ai souvent été attiré par leur photo alléchante publiées sur leur site facebook. Le thé glacé est fait devant vous avec minutie, ce qui est franchement impressionnant. La soupe était vraiment excellente avec des fêves de lima dedans aini que des lardons. Miam. Le BLT était halluciant, avec des tomates marinées dedans ce qui est un changement intéressant. L'ambiance est vraiment chaleureuse, la taille minuscule du restaurant aide a créer des liens avec le personnnel. Bref, j'y retourne sous peu!"}
{"text":"OK I hope I won't bust the character limit on this one because I'm about to go off like a 14 year old adolescent boy who's just touched boob for the first time. That pretty much sums up the DTC experience.  The restaurant is barely visible from the street. You could miss it even walking by slowly. The place is tiny. It can't sit more than 8 or 9 people and sometimes you have to eat standing up. But there are plans to expand in the empty store next door. The lack of seating is the only \"negative\" to the Dinette Triple Crown. And compared to the rest of the experience, it doesn't even make a blip on the radar.  DTC serves up Southern Comfort Food on EPIC AWESOMNESS level never before registered. Our metric EPIC AWESOMNESS gathering instruments overloaded and exploded in a huge foodgasmic mushroom cloud...DTC is owned by a couple, one being a Canadian girl from BC (who speaks excellent French by the way) an her husband, a God-Like Chef from the Great State of Kentucky - and yes he even has the twirley 'stash.  Where to start? Seriously! Eating at DTC is like waking up next to 10 naked ladies and you have an hour left to live...that's the kind of pressure you're facing when looking at the menu. Let's start with what brought me to DTC. Fried Chicken. Since travelling to the southern states in the US and partaking of Brown Paper Bag Fried Chicken, I've been chasing the fried chicken dragon for years. The chase is over. This is without a doubt the best fried chicken I've ever had...EVER. They have 5 or 6 different sauces on the counters for their delicious grub, but this chicken needs nothing. It's juicy, piping hot and I dunno what kind of magic he puts in the dredge, but the crispy fried skin is a gustatory explosion of flavour.  But wait, that's not all... they have this pulled-pork sammich which defies reason. Some of the best pulled pork I've ever had, served on one of their homemade buns - yes they make ALL their own breads, including biscuits but more on that later - served with cheese and some crazy delicious creamy slaw. I'm at a loss for words. They have an equally impressive brisket sammich.   Each meat can be served with sides, the classic southern Meat & Threes. Hushpuppies - deep-fried corn bread - topped with ranch sauce can be eaten by the bucket full. Smoked and roasted sweet potatoes will ruin every other sweet potato side dish experience you've ever had. Even the mash is crazy insane. It's probably half potato, half butter top with their maddening gravy. They also have other southern sides like kale, black-eyed peas, and of course cornbread.  Then there's something that shouldn't be talked about out loud, their total hit-it-out-of-the-park batshit crazy take on Mac n' Cheese. You've never had Mac n' Cheese until you've had THIS Mac n' Cheese. Sharp cheeses melted into a creamy goodness, baked with more cheese and should probably be registered as some sort of weapon.   And they always have specials for both starters and entrées, the most memorable being Buffalo Pig Tails. Yup, pig tails, deep fried and served like Buffalo Chicken Wings... I'll give you a moment to wrap your mind around that one. But trust me they were beyond any expectations you might have.  Their attention to the little things is masterful. Sure you can get some cola with your grub but why would you, when you can get made-to-order lemonade - from freshly squeezed lemons and limes. They also have a great selection of Kentucky bourbons. Making things even better, there's a park across the street and they've capitalized on this by offering you a picnic basket with a picnic blanket and all the goodies you need to have your picnic in the park with their mindblowing grub.  Wait there's also deserts... not just any deserts. Deserts you want... well I had a lot of sexual innuendo in mind but you get the idea right? They don't make apple pie, they make deep fried apple dumplings topped with bourbon caramel and fresh whipped cream. They don't have strawberry shortcakes, they have Cranberry & Biscuit topped with again bourbon caramel and whipped cream. They desert biscuits are sweeter the regular biscuit and make any desert they make sublime... you could eat pounds of them biscuit. They have classics like chess pie, pecan pie, coconut pie and other concoctions of Level 80 Wizarsds. You cannot resist eating their deserts. You just hear what they prepared; you know you will break like a 40 year sober alcoholic when offered a glass of 16 year old single malt Islay Scotch.  Whatever you do, don't go there without a wolf's appetite. You're gonna eat till you guts burst and you'll want to go on. The greatest southern food experience you'll have in Montreal and pretty much anywhere else. Not to forget the extremely welcoming demeanour of the owners and the staff. Great food, booze and atmosphere. I can't say it enough, just go there and eat. Everyone I bring there is turned into a total addict before they're done chewing on their first bite."}
{"text":"It seems sort of strange that we opted for a Southern US-style restaurant while visiting Canada, but the reviews for this restaurant led us to try it.  We had dinner here as our family's Friday night finale of our trip to Montreal and it did not disappoint.  It is a little tough to find and like many trendy establishments in Brooklyn or Philadelphia has no storefront sign.  The environment was simple, rustic and the music was just right.  We enjoyed the fancy cocktails and sodas, loved the hush puppies, but the chicken was the star of this show.  That Big Nasty sandwich is a winner!  I suppose they were limited by the layout of their space, but if you eat on one side of the building, you have to go outside and back in to use the restroom and if you eat on the other side of the building, you have to go outside and back in to pay your bill.  That was the only unfortunate element.  Otherwise,  Dinette Triple Crown is a top-notch eatery!"}
{"text":"Excellent ! Tried out today the meat & threes. Both my boyfriend and I agreed on hushpuppies & mac and cheese being our absolute faves. Everything was amazing though (biscuits, collard greens, fried chicken, fried sweet potatoes). Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family has a guilty pleasure for fried chicken. The first thing we did when they picked me up at the airport was search for the best fried chicken in Montreal. This place did not disappoint and is very family friendly. It's easy to order family style so that you can order many sides and everyone can share. Not better than the fried chicken from Popeyes but obviously a much better setting."}
{"text":"Found this gem, while starved in the neighbourhood thanks to Yelp!   All the details are covered here.  Try an Old Fashioned done the old fashioned way while you wait."}
{"text":"This place is Legit Good.  I got The Big Nasty and caramel shake...  Firstly, the shake: Holy Cow! This was a seriously thick shake, even on the 35c day I had it. It's actually a salted caramel shake, which is awesome. Get it.  Secondly, The Big Nasty: This bad boy is a fried chicken sandwich on home-made bread, covered in gravy. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make gravy-covered chicken still be crispy - that defies food physics! The fried chicken from this place is amazing (just check all the other reviews for confirmation).  I didn't get a chance to try anything from their impressive boozy drinks menu (I ain't even mad - try the salted caramel milkshake and you'll understand why), but I will be going back to do so.  There isn't much space in the place itself (it's little more than a counter and a couple of chairs), but they offer to give you a picnic basket to take to the park across the road (with cutlery, etc) which is really cool."}
{"text":"Dinette Triple Crown, a Southern restaurant run by a Kentucky chef, serves a hell of a mac n' cheese! Topped with delicious homemade lemonade and chili-blackberry soda, the whole thing handed to us in a cute picnic basket for casual eating in the nearby park, the experience was memorable.  The place is small but charming, and allows visitors to see the staff working in the kitchen. The service was perfect and amicable, and the menu is tempting. As a vegetarian, I will admit I cannot speak for the quality of their fried chicken, the but mac n' cheese is something; fresh, chewy, cheesy.   Adding to the hundred-plus existing reviews, I confirm that this place is worth visiting. My Texan husband, who sometimes misses the food from home, loves this place."}
{"text":"A great southern comfort food spot. Great staff and quick service. There takeout baskets are the really charming part about this place!    Try the Fried chicken with the 3 sides. hush puppies, sweet potato and a biscuit. The foods definite great and they also deliver around the area i was told! Check this place out. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go in the summer. It's right across the street from a beautiful park in Montreal's Little Italy district. You go up to the counter, order your fried chicken, lemonade (comes in mason jars!) and fixin's, and then wait for them to bag it up for you. Then you head to the park and eat your fill.   I enjoyed the fried chicken (although I found it a little overdone and dry), and was impressed by the quality and the variety of the sides. The hush puppies were great (albeit a little sweet), and the mac and cheese was good.   I would disagree with some people on here who think that this place compares to real fried chicken joints of the American South, but hey, maybe I'm just a huge snob? Either way, this is a great place to check out on a hot summer's day."}
{"text":"UPDATE: this place does picnic baskets in summer and they're INCREDIBLE   also I finally tried the mac & cheese. It's excellent. Although my mac & cheese vote might still go to Cafe Resonance, this place is a very close second!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here several years, and just want to say that DTC knows what they're doing! They make delicious comfort food that in my opinion is the best Southern american style food Montreal has yet dared to emulate (there are many 'BBQ' places cropping up, but many aren't all that great), and they do such a good job and it sort of belongs in its own category of comfort food.  Their pulled pork and brisket is ace, tender, well seasoned and not too sweet, and their chicken and side choices are all very good too. I like that you can order a reasonably healthy meal here or go the full hog and end up in a totally worthwhile food coma.   Desserts are also delicious and homemade, and not just an afterthought.   All of this to say that I haven't had such delicious southern food outside of the south, so I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a chilly evening indoors or nice afternoon picnic when you can take out and eat next door at the park."}
{"text":"Finally! Montreal has been in deep need of a place like this, and finally we have one - unpretentious, delicious comfort food in the style of American southern, and they pull it off with flying colours.  Everything I had here was delicious, the people behind the counter were really sweet and they even deliver this stuff to your home if it's too cold out to make the trek. I mean - c'mon.   Bravo ;)"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this place cause oh why get fried chicken/soul food in Montreal. (When I'm visiting from the States) But oh man i was wrong. This place is the bomb. I can't be completely sure how authentic this is, but damn, it's delicious. So this place is a bit small. It can only hold like maybe 6-10 people sitting inside the actual restaurant. BUT you have an option for a picnic! Which I did read about on other yelps or have imagined it would be an actual picnic. Since there weren't many open seats for a group of four, we did a picnic. Dinette Triple Crown gives you the picnic basket, the blanket, utensils, mason jars for cups, water, napkins, sanitary wipes, etc. All the things you need for a picnic at the park that is across the street from the restaurant. (Oh and you have the option to take out as well if you're a local)  So I had no idea that they actual did that! I was super surprised. The ladies at the counter are super nice and down to earth. They answered our questions and was really accommodating when we didn't want a picnic cause we thought it was gonna rain, but we did the picnic anyway because they had the basket ready. The lady said it was really nice to have a picnic under the gazebo at the park. And that's exactly what we did. It was so nice!   Now for the actual food, it is delicious~! I had some mac & cheese with a side of fried sweet potatoes. This mac & cheese is definitely different than the norm. You can real taste the cheese because it was slightly bitter or tangy? I'm not sure, but it was different. It was also pretty heavy. I love sweet potatoes and it came with sauce. It tasted so good! I had a piece of my friend's chicken, and it was juicy and moist in the inside. When I thought fried chicken, I thought they bread it and deep fried the chicken. That was not the case. I'm not sure what they did but it goes well the sauces they gave us.   It may be a little expensive but it is portion is right for the price. They also had some alcoholic drinks that I look good too.   I see some reviews about the wait time, we came off peak (in the summer), so we didn't wait too long. Maybe 30 minutes. It wasn't too bad. I would love to come back and try something else!! Get the chicken! You won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are traveling from California and thought we'd check this place out after reading all the amazing reviews. We were very disappointed; Everything looks better than it actually tastes. They definitely tried to make it their own by adding their own twist, but on this day, they failed. The chicken tasted plain and was full of nerves. They mentioned making their own lemonade, onsite, yet they went and ruined it by adding carbonation, which they don't mention. Natural lemonade sure sounded great, too. Bummer.   The service was on point and the atmosphere was authentic enough. The prices were reasonable. And of course, we understand that every restaurant has their off days, however, in order to be honest we have to rate it on the one visit we prepared to give it, and this is it. We won't be coming back to try it again. Maybe you'll have better luck, but I would recommend avoiding unless you're really in the mood for so so chicken, good service, and a letdown on all other fronts."}
{"text":"My experience was amazing! I think it was also because I got to experience this place with a few of my friends. Great food and great company always win.  This place is small little resto, a street beside Little Italy. I didn't think their fried chicken would be anything special (because my friend hyped it up) and was a little shook when I saw the price of them. WORTH EVERY CENT. I really don't know what it is but their chicken is probably the most delicious fried chicken I've ever tasted. Their Mac-n-Cheese is also freaking delicious. I wouldn't think it would be, just because I feel so many places just don't put effort into the mac-n-cheese. Their mash potatoes and gravy as well is just heavenly! Just writing this review a few days after having it, makes me want to go back and get some.    I love that they provide a picnic concept since they're just across from a park. It really allows you to enjoy the company of your friends, the food and just the outdoors. The one thing that worries me about this place is, during the winter! This place is just so small I can't imagine when everyone wants to sit and eat inside."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Got the corn bread fritters, pulled pork, taco stew and finished with caramel brownie! The lemonade was refreshing also. Everything was delicious! Great in summer if you want to go to park next door they pack a picnic for you!"}
{"text":"We had the brilliant idea to order a bunch of food and then devour in the nearby park. It was as fun as it sounds!  So we came here on a Saturday night, grabbed our prepared basket and crossed the street. Seems like other people had the same idea but we had a nice bench to share the southern feast. We ordered a little bit of everything and the things that stood out for me what of course, the excellent chicken, the lemonade and the dessert. Everything else was solid but I'd come back just for the chicken. On a special note, I didn't like the Mac n' Cheese, it felt off but then again never been a huge fan of the dish.  Price-tag is pretty expensive. Service was fine. Picnic idea is pretty awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Je suis allé manger avec des amis. Il y a une pièce à côté qui est la salle à manger et l'autre place pour Emporter et avec quelques banc disponible pour manger au bar. La salle à manger est toujours remplie et une réservation, si vous voulez manger avec un groupe, est nécessaire. Le staff est amical et professionnel. Le menu est simple et réduit et on voit qu'il y a clairement une équipe très bien roddé ici.  J'ai mangé le Mac N Cheese et 3 morceaux de poulet frit. Le pain de maïs (Corn Bread) et les Hush Puppies avec une sauce Ranch. J'ai aussi pris un drink (un Southside) et le Derby (Une tarte au chocolat avec praline).  Il n'y a pas de raccourcis! Tout est bien fait et c'était délicieux. Un des personnes avec qui j'étais à pris la salade et c'était un bon size et j'ai compris qu'il y a quelques options végétarienne qui sont très bien. Le poulet frit était croustillant et délicieux. j'ai essayé quelques sauces mais pour 1$, il y a une possibilité d'avoir une sauce brune qui est semble-t-il délicieux. J'ai goûté porc effiloché et je dois dire que c'était bon, mais un peu trop cuit à mon goût. En gros les légumes selon mon ami n'étaient pas excellent. Le dessert était excellent, très sucrée mais avec une quenelle de crème fouetté qui diluait le sucre et balançait ce dessert.   Après ce très gros repas, tip inclus, j'ai payé moins de 50$. Très belle expérience, je vais retourné et je vais surement me prendre un repas pour apporté car c'est très occupé et on a été chanceux d'avoir de la place pour manger au \"bar\"."}
{"text":"A tip from an insider can really go a long way in the Montreal food scene. For this place, I recommend calling in your order and then picking it up. Talk about saving yourself some serious wait time!   Other than the wait, which was two hours last summer when I went to TCD for the first time, the food here is magical. The fried chicken and biscuits are worthy of any southern grandma's kitchen and the picnic-style service is better than any sit down brunch I've been to."}
{"text":"Holy fried chicken Batman!  I'll be dreaming about my meal at Dinette Triple Crown for a long time it was so good.  They are a small restaurant serving up what has to be the best Southern food in Montreal.   They also make picnic baskets in summertime so you can take the food to the park across the street for a picnic.  The ambiance here is great.  It's casual, laidback and has a Southern feel to it.   They've also got old school music playing which also is a fun touch.  I'm fairly certain that the music is mostly from the 20s but I could be mistaken on that one.  The fried chicken oh the fried chicken!  Normally I'm not the biggest fan of it but this one was awesome!  It was crispy and I loved the seasoning.  The sides are not to be missed either.  The mac and cheese was creamy and divine.  The biscuit was flaky and buttery.  I was so full but couldn't bring myself to stop eating because I couldn't let that food go to waste.  Somehow after all that food I managed to find room for a slice of chess pie.  It's a cornmeal and buttermilk pie seasoned with lemon zest.  It was dense and well balanced.  The crust was flaky and buttery.  Even the whipped cream wasn't your average whipped cream from a can.  Desserts change daily so be sure to ask what they have when you go.  They serve up the classic cocktails you can get anywhere as well as a few of their own creations.  Go for the ones that they've developed because those are delicious.  They are also strong and worth the money.  I had what I believe was called the Briar's Patch and I really enjoyed it.  It had bourbon, soda, lemon and something else which I can't remember but you could really taste the alcohol.  They also spike the milkshakes with bourbon if you're in the mood for that.  I've made it a mission to come back and try everything on the menu because there is just so much more to discover.  Dinette Triple Crown is seriously amazing.  You get a delicious meal for fairly reasonable prices.  What's not to love about that?"}
{"text":"Good place, nice atmosphere.  Their staff were nice and friendly.  Loved their spicy sauce. The cocktails are good too.  Defiantly visiting again."}
{"text":"This place brings love back into food. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall, but given the option I'd eat at this place every night. The waitress was amazing; she really took the time to explain every item on the menu and how to get the most out of all the flavours. Everything was amazing! Here is what our table ordered: Milk shake, gumbo, brisket, biscuits, hushpuppies, corn bread, deep fried chicken, pulled pork, square pie. Wonderful meal!!!"}
{"text":"I'll recommend this place to anyone who's in town.  Really good Southern comfort food.  the Fried Chicken is good and they provide 5+ different sauces (made from scratch in their kitchen). The BBQ mustard sauce is my favourite.  it's not in the middle of a busy tourist area so it's nice to see a different area of town."}
{"text":"Fastastic! When you have that many reviews and still maintaining 4+ means they must be doing something right... And let me tell ya, they do. They make Mac and Cheese right, they make fried chicken right, they make hush puppies right, they make smash potatoes right, they make everything right! There is not one single dish that I didn't like!   It's a cozy little place, I would say maximum 40 peoples, but a take out counter next door. The food is delicious, the service is great with a smile included at no charge :).   My top 3 suggestion food, fried chicken, hush puppies and mac and cheese.   I NEED to go back and tryout different things!  Ps. My only complaint, not to the restaurant, it's very difficult to find parking in the area. But hey, if it's easy to find parking, this place would have long line up! LoL"}
{"text":"This was so awesome!!!!!  Really great. Best service and on nice day they prepare your order in a basket with condiments and all so you can enjoy your meal in the park.  You have to try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Very very nice place for some tasty food. Specially if you go with friends, they offer you picnic basket with everything inside, you can go to the park and enjoy your food.  Highly recommended, especially their \"Big Nasty\" with the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Nous avions essayé le panier à pique-nique cet été et nous avions adoré notre expérience culinaire. Cette fois-ci, c'est un souper en famille avec les 2 ados qui nous a ravi. C'était très bon et les 2 cocktails étaient impeccables."}
{"text":"The server told us that the chef is south American and that makes the whole place more authentic. Everything I had was enjoyed and comforting. There are about several different bottles of homemade sauces on the side of the table which are absolutely fantastic and goes well with pretty much anything on the menu.  I highly recommend this place not only for Southern American food but just for the sake of eating good comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. I went for lunch with my brother and nephew and sat at the counter. The decor definitely puts you in a southern mood. The employees are so wonderful. A crowd started to gather after we placed our order and I watched them manage taking orders, making drinks, and getting orders out the order in a calm fashion. We didn't wait long for our food, but I would have been okay with a bit of a longer wait as everything is freshly prepared and is very delicious. My family comes from Georgia so I grew up eating soul food. This was such a wonderful interpretation of southern cuisine. So much attention to flavor and quality. I had the 2 piece fried chicken meal with braised greens mac and cheese, and a side of gravy. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy and not greasy. The greens were seasoned well and the mac and cheese was such a treat. My nephew ordered the Big Nasty. Fried chicken on a biscuit served in a pool of gravy. Yum! My brother got the catfish special which came with vegetables and was served in a broth. Such a unique way of serving catfish and the combination was really tasty. They offer picnic baskets you can take the park which is such a clever idea. We got there around 1:00 right before a line started forming to order. People waited patiently for about 30 minutes just to order which shows their dedication in wanting to eat there. I plan on returning many times in the future and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've never been a corn bread fan - I am now. The fried chicken and gravy is delish and they have great sides."}
{"text":"Un véritable coup de coeur !  Ce petit restau propose peu de places assises, mais l'intérêt est ailleurs : il suffit de préciser qu'on souhaite le panier de picnic et nous voilà chargés, d'un panier en osier, d'une nappe carottée  et de tous les ustensiles nécessaires : pot masson d'eau, assiettes, napkin... Sans oublier le meilleur : la bouffe ! Et hop, direction le parc d'en face. On se croit aussi un peu dans le sud des Etats-Unis, il fait chaud, on ne compte pas ses calories et on se gâte !  Au choix, de la viande, j'ai opté pour le poulet frit (bien sûr), et 3 accompagnements : patates douces rissolées, hushpuppies (yummy !!) et les légumes verts braisés (pour la conscience). La limonade maison est glacée et délicieuse, le poulet croustillant et plein de saveurs, et le reste... mon dieu. Bien sûr il y a tellement de choix qu'on se sait plus où donner de la tête (et du ventre) donc il faudra bien revenir !   Profitez des beaux jours pour y courir !!"}
{"text":"I'm actually contemplating leaving Verdun (which I LOVE) to move up to this neighbourhood just so I'm closer to Triple Crown Dinette - it's THAT good!  Seriously, the fried chicken here is probably the best in Montreal and one of the best I've had in my life. (The only place I've possibly had better was down in North Carolina where they used Corn Flakes crumbs and deep fried the chicken in pure butter!). But it's not *just* fried chicken. The sides are amazing as well, the gravy, the mashed potatoes, roasted sweet potatoes, hushpuppies, mac'n cheese, braised Collard greens - all of it is stellar - then there are the daily specials which change all the time. Desserts change all the time as well. Today it was Lemon Meringue Pie and Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce to give you an idea.  You will have no choice but to arrange to make multiple trips here so that you can eventually eat your way through the menu and that's saying something!  It's a tiny space, with only 8 sitting spots, they do most of their business with take-out and particularly during the summer months when picnic baskets are arranged and everyone eats at the park. From what I understand, they will be expanding soon and will also have a proper sit-down restaurant which serves the same awesome food.  Triple Crown Dinette people: Seriously, just expand all over the city already and put KFC out of business.  Come to Verdun, cheap rents abound and then there's the park beside the riverside as well!"}
{"text":"The concept of having them prepare a picnic basket and eat in the park is great.  The service is friendly but very slow, over one hour for a takeout meal... But I understand they are very busy.  The food was ok. I found the fried chicken to have too little coating. The pulled pork was greasy but not overly sweet. The macaroni and cheese was bland. The sweet potatoes are interesting. The only standout were the hushpuppies... Delicious.   Maybe I got a bad day... I will certainly try it again only because I love the concept so much."}
{"text":"Loooove this place. The fried chicken is crispy and tender and the mac n cheese simply to die for. You can order your food and have someone bring it to you in a cute picnic basket in front of the restaurant which makes for a really fun and cute date. They also have really good homemade iced tea and lemonade. The staff is always nice, polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves southern food or would like to try it out for the first time!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 10 star if I could. The food is simply amazing, staff super friendly and accommodating. There's always a line but don't let that deter you, the wait is more than worth it. Anyone in Montreal you must come here!! It will be life changing!! Thank you Triple Crown :) a great way to finish my vacation."}
{"text":"I LOVE their copper glassware! Next home inspo for sure. As a pescatarian they have varying options for me.  My favourite are their cocktails and hush puppies haha! Apparently the chicken is amazing, and I really liked a shrimp salad special they have.  I am dying to try their desserts. Their sturgeon potato salad and their mac and cheese were misses for me."}
{"text":"Didn't see the point of all the tasteless and greasy fried food. The frying was done properly but everything was bland. I had 3 pieces of fried chicken, hushpuppies, fried sweet potatoes, and beans for 18$+tx.   The fried chicken was barely better than KFC's. The salt was ok but it didn't taste anything other than that. I'd suggest adding more spices in the batter.  Hushpuppies well... it's fried cornbread. But that would have been fine if they didn't add sour cream all over them. That tasted grease over grease.  Same with fried sweet potatoes, the sauce was overwhelmingly greasy and tasteless in general.  The pinto beans... tasted the best in my meal., but nothing out of this world.  I'm still rating this a 3 star though, mainly because it's one of the only places in Montreal that serves southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try while on vacation. It was amazing! The mac and cheese was on point and the fried chicken was perfect. White and dark meat were both tender and juicy. Not too much breading and the seasoning was spot on. The mashed potatoes were excellent as well. The staff were super friendly and very helpful. The wife got a Long Island and it was exceptional. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"When visiting Montreal from the US mid-west, why not visit a place specializing in American southern cooking? The chef is from Kentucky, the menu is representative of great regional American cuisine. The staff is super super friendly and knowledgeable. The fried chicken is delicious, as is the macaroni and cheese. Greens and beans are both flavored excellently. Stray misfires: the oddly gray mashed potatoes and gravy, the lackluster cornbread and the bread pudding which doesn't resemble any bread pudding I have ever encountered. The dinette itself is tiny, but they do often open the larger dining room two doors down (but connected to the restaurant behind the stairway between the two shops)."}
{"text":"DO NOT miss this place if in Montreal.  It's a chic little spot, with very cool decor.   You place your order, order a delicious craft cocktail, hang out and enjoy it while they actually cook and then pack your lunch in a beautiful picnic basket, complete with silverware and glasses and a blanket, and you walk to the park next door for your picnic!   I went twice, and had to get the \"Le Big Nasty\" both times.  I'll let you find out about that yourself, I'll just say that I'm ordering it when I'm there again next month.  I have to say that I've never had bad food in Montreal, but this adds such a hip twist to a dining experience as well! super fun.  While you're eating, take a look around the park while you sip and eat and take in the happy hipsters and buskers around you."}
{"text":"Honestly these photos attached don't even give this food it's full justice. We went last night and I probably ate the best Mac and cheese I've ever eaten at a restaurant, so many great flavours in one dish. And my boyfriend said that the brisket was one of the best he's had and that the cornbread was good too.   The restaurant is divided in two sections, the one next to the bar is small and cozy and so adorable. Honestly, now that we know of this place we'll be going so often."}
{"text":"On my regular Saturday bike ride to and from Jean Talon Market, I occasionally use the opportunity to stop and try some desired location located on my route through Mile End and Little Italy. Last week, I was in the mood for some BBQ so I headed off to a pretty new addition to the scene in Little Italy, Dinette Triple Crown.  As a fan of BBQ, I was instantly intrigued and boy... was I not disappointed. The restaurant is in a small space at the corner of St-Zotique and Clark across from Martel park. There is a small counter area to sit inside but the place is really set up to pick up and enjoy elsewhere. In fact, they offer an option to provide a picnic basket filled with your order to bring across the street to enjoy outside. Had I not been alone, the option would have been a perfect one but inside was just as enjoyable. The restaurant has a cool look with amazing music playing throughout. Any place that plays jazz, crooner and soul music the whole time is a winner in my books!  The menu options run the gamut of classic southern style food: brisket, fried chicken, pulled pork, biscuits, sweet potato, greens, etc... I went for a large wide swatch of their options for my lunch: Pulled pork sandwich, one piece of fried chicken, a buttermilk biscuit, sweet potatoes and a lemonade. There wasn't a single bad option on this plate. The sweet potatoes were perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior without the interior becoming complete mush. The biscuit was a perfect combination of rich, soft, flaky goodness. It was the kind of thing where you can just tell that lots of butter and buttermilk was used in its making but you don't care in the least. The fried chicken was simply perfect - the skin was crispy, seasoned perfectly and not overbearing. The chicken was probably the moistest I've ever experienced with fried chicken. That classic feeling of needing to drink loads of water to offset the dryness of fried chicken was nowhere to be found. The chicken definitely deserved to be enjoyed in a larger quantity but that had to wait because I needed to try the pulled pork.  When I want to judge a BBQ place, the pulled pork or the ribs are, to me, the to go options. The pulled pork here is just amazing. Perfectly done with the right level of tenderness &amp; amazing flavor and that is without sauce because at Dinette, the pulled pork sandwich comes un-sauced. On the table, you have numerous options of sauces from which to choose from. You have a more classic Memphis BBQ sauce, a South Carolina mustard sauce and a vinegar based East Carolina sauce. Dinette Triple Crown also experiment with other sauce options from time to time. When I was there, the chef came over to provide me with a sample of his current concoction, a peach jalapeño sauce. Let me repeat that because I believe it deserves to be repeated: peach jalapeño sauce. Now, I really don't enjoy jalapeño spice but I definitely needed to try this one. I tried both it and the Memphis BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce was spot-on and hit the notes you expect from a top notch BBQ place. The Peach jalapeño sauce was just out of bounds. Spicy to start with a nice sweetness midway to cool the pallet before the heat kicks up again at the finish, this sauce was ridiculous. Just ridiculous. Not sure how much I use it given my lack of hot sauce enjoyment but for those who do, Dinette does sell the sauces they make periodically so check it out with that's your style.  All in all, Dinette Triple Crown is the best southern BBQ experience I've ever had. Period. Anyone who loves BBQ needs to stop over and give this place a shot. I will definitely be heading back very soon to try the rest of the menu.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fianlly got around to trying this place! I love southern food and have been trying to find places here that serve it as good as I've had from Florida. This place does come close, but it still doesn't compare to what I've had in the states. So to start, the fried sweet potatoes were pretty bad... soggy and oily as hell. I couldnt even finish them. The mac and cheese and corn bread were fine, not anything to write home about. However, the fried chicken and biscuits were incredible! The pieces of chicken were on the smaller size however which was a bummer cause I wanted more! I would definitley go back just for the chicken and biscuits, thats about it though. Very expensive for the portion size as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant is fairly humble looking from the outside.  No flashy signs or decors.  This place has a private dining area adjacent to the small take-out front.  The restaurant is packed on a Friday night.  We waited 45mins before being seated (we had no prior reservation).    Each of us chose the \"Meat and Threes\" which is choose one meat and three sides OR choose one meat, one Mac and cheese and one side.  My order was pulled pork, Mac and cheese, creamy coleslaw with a side order of fried chicken.    Our orders came promptly, served in large plates. We were starving and began devouring each others food immediately.  On meats, the pulled pork is definitely more juicy compared to the smoked brisket and fried chicken.  Breading on the chicken is crisp but inside is a little dry.  Smoked brisket is average in texture/taste.  Side dish of mac and cheese provided a huge kick of creamy cheese.  Moving to the sides, the coleslaw is a creamy balance to the meats.  The hush puppies are also good too.  I would avoid braised greens for the mushy leafy texture.    Overall, it was a good dining experience.  Food was pleasing to the palette.  Service was attentive with empty water jugs refreshed with new ones.  I would come back here for group dining or to grab a quick take-out."}
{"text":"After my third visit to Dinette Triple Crown, I can say with confidence that the food has gotten worse every time I've visited. I got the three piece chicken meal with hushpuppies and macaroni and cheese. The chicken breasts were extremely small, the hushpuppies (perhaps the best item on the menu) have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY smaller since the first time I visited in 2016. The worst item I received hands down was the macaroni and cheese - its funky aftertaste and soupy consistency may appeal to some, but does not qualify in my books as proper mac 'n' cheese. I did have a taste of my partner's brussels sprouts (a special that day), and they were EXCELLENT. I also found the pricing to be on the more expensive side.   The decor of the restaurant was homey if not a bit plantation-y. I noticed with bemusement that most of the female staff were clad in colonial attire - long skirts with braided hair. I don't know if this was intentional but it came across as stereotypical at best and insensitive at worst. In addition, the restaurant featured period-style family photos of white familes, ignoring the African American roots of soul food.   Overall, the food was mediocre and overpriced. That being said, Montreal does not have a lot of soul food options, so if you are desperate for some, this is the place to go. The best of a limited lot."}
{"text":"We tried the Triple Crown on the recommendation of a local we were subletting an apartment from while visiting Montreal from California. The whole picnic and bring your own wine concept sounded great for my wife's birthday dinner, but to be honest, I wasn't expecting to find great southern fare in Quebec.  What a surprise. Everything was perfect from the food, the service and the well thought out picnic basket. We liked it so much we had to come back for our final dinner in the city before heading home.  Their fried chicken is among the best or possibly the best I have ever have had and I've had plenty from Louisiana, Tennessee, and south Los Angeles.  It had a delicious, not overwhelmingly heavy, seasoned batter with thoroughly cooked and still moist meat.  The sides were amazing too. Golden mashed potatoes with perfect gravy, again seasoned nicely. Mac n Cheese that looked like maybe they finish off in a broiler and tasted as good as it looked. The greens were perfect too.  The hush puppies also were the best I've had, perfect, not rock hard or gritty like they are often served elsewhere.  On our second visit I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the brisket, (but had to have more of that fried chicken too). The brisket was just as great as the chicken, a generous serving that was tender and flavorful with a great BBQ sauce.  The only desert we tried was their perfectly baked lemon meringue pie that was far above the standard. There was nothing in our two visits that we did not like or had us saying to ourselves \"this would be better if...\"   So as good as the food was it was nice that everything else about this place was just as great. The hip young owners were extremely helpful and friendly in describing the menu as well as special sides and desserts they had for that day.  And when our food came up everything was efficiently packed in a basket for us to carry over to Little Italy Park across the street. Though they have some limited counter space inside to eat, with the weather so nice the park was the place to have our meal.  The picnic basket had everything we could need; a real table cloth, towel, large mason jar of drinking water, real glasses for the water and another set for our wine, corkscrew, candle & lighter, real plates and utensils (not paper or plastic), napkins and a trio of squeeze bottles containing their great sauces. The tables in the park did fill up on each evening we were there, so get there early."}
{"text":"The restaurant gives you the food in a picnic basket and you go eat at outside in the parc nextdoors. Great idea and it was really fun especially on a good weather day. However, if the weather is bad there is barely a place to sit inside the restaurant. The fried chicken itself was good. The sides were great. The fried sweet potatoes and the mashed potatoes were the best. It's slightly overpriced but overall we all enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"J'y vais ou en commande régulièrement et la qualité de leur poulet est toujours au rendez-vous. Je vous recommande le mac and cheese et les patates douces comme à côté!! Oubliez pas une petite portion de gravy avec votre poulet."}
{"text":"Great food! Good service, and an excellent choice of Bourbon!! Definitely coming back for that tasty fried chicken #yas!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, FINALLY some killer American food à Montréal!  A plethora of sauces?  Check.  Fresh and in-house made pickles?  Check.  Succulent and amazing fried chicken?  Triple check.  Check ben this amazing new spot in Little Italy.  I went with a buddy and we grabbed the fried chicken plate and the tacos (with in-house tortillas, to boot!) and promptly had socks blown off.  The pulled pork in the tacos was delectably moist and highlighted by the salsa, radishes, and cilantro that got together dans bouche and had a kickin' tex-mex fiesta.  The chicken came with some puréed patates and thick, voluptuous gravy.  Like a Rubens, but in sauce form straight up.  Finally, just to be real gluttons, we grabbed a slice of the lemon merengue.  This is coming from somebody that doesn't love lemon merengue under most situations, and it was lovely.  The service was super friendly and quick which is always a nice touch.  If you have to eat and run or have the time to fart around and shoot the shit with the proprieter/owner, Beaver Shephard, you will be perfectly pleased as punch.  And apparently a liquor license is in the works?  This is going to go off the chain!!"}
