{"text":"Best sushi place in Gilbert.

yes even over Otaku and Blue Wasabi"}
{"text":"Will Kreitler, my good pal recommended this place, and I'm sure glad he did. Very tasty vegas rolls and good happy hour. The staff is friendly and professional. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Have ordered numerous times for pick up, but have to say eating in is even better."}
{"text":"Was hoping this would be a good sushi place, but was anything but good. Sushi took an hour to come out and was subpar. No refills on our water the whole time and they charged us full price for sushi that was on their happy hour menu, I guess they don't even know their own happy hours. I've been to quite a few sushi restaurants in the valley and this is by far the worst place. ?????????"}
{"text":"This is a great place for both traditional sushi and unique fusion roles.

I don't quite understand why this place is hardly ever busy - I can only figure it's the location that fails to draw a crowd.  The food is great and the chefs and wait staff are always super friendly.   Prices are about average and they have recently incorporated some great lunch combos."}
{"text":"This has been our recent sushi spot! fresh fish (love the nigiri and the baked scallop roll)... great dishes from
the kitchen (killer chicken wings appetizer and yummy yakisoba)! Great service and fast sushi prep! Our weekly sushi fix is satisfied x 10 at Sushi Ave"}
{"text":"I made a pick up order due to a time crunch. The hostess, Hannah,is the sweetest thing I've ever spoken to. Very accommodating and pleasant! She made sure that our order was perfect. 

I work in customer service and it's really awesome to experience others 'actually' doing and enjoying their job. I'm bringing my fianc√© back to dine-in as soon as we get the time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time and LOVE IT. We are picky sushi eaters and this is one of our favorites in Gilbert. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is off the chain! My gal pals and I made it a tradition to stop by for happy hour most weeks! Their rolls are fresh and the edamame nice and warm always :) We will never go anywhere else for sushi!!!!!!!! capital L-O-V-E LOVE IT. 
Now THAT is what I call............Sushi. 

P.s. Love the dessert orange :^)"}
{"text":"This is a great Sushi restaurant with an excellent happy hour.  The rolls are well priced and we prefer to drive out to this location even though we have several other gilbert Sushi locations closer to our home.  My favorite rolls are the Pink Lady Roll, Spicy Crab and the Philly Roll.  The service is always very good and the price is just right.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nicole S. has said it all.  

Tonight we had an added attraction,  the entertainment was watching the sushi chef smell the fish in view of the dinners.  Maybe that should have been done in the back before they opened for dinner."}
{"text":"We've been eating awesome sushi at a great price at Sushi Avenue for about a year now. It's become a regular stop for my wife and I. We love the atmosphere and service, and the value is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Place is awesome happy hour is great my daughter loves the udon noodle amazing service hannah was our server and she was amazing"}
{"text":"Finally got over to check this place out. So excited to have good sushi and friendly service so close to home...we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place I've ever been to. For happy hour their rolls as low as $3 and they are amaaaazing. It's a way chill atmosphere too. GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and have been very impressed both times. The sushi is very fresh and I really appreciate how the rolls are cut. This sounds weird, right? Stay with me. Usually I feel like I'm going to choke on a piece of sushi because it is so large and I don't really enjoy the flavors as much as I would if the pieces were manageable. Alright... go ahead with the \"that's what she said\" joke. This review is asking for it. 

But this restaurant is fast becoming my favorite for sushi. The service I have experienced has always been top notch. 

Can't wait to go back for Sushi Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I used to love Kanpai - great prices, quality food, and an excellent staff. I don't know if it was sold or what they are doing but 'Sushi Ave' is now treading on the classic and established Kanpai name. Prices are higher, portions are smaller, and the quality of the fish is horrid. All my old favorites are gone and the recipes have all changed. 

I'm really disappointed to lose one of my favorite sushi bars in Phoenix, but as one of the new staff said 'we have to change it up'. Sadly I won't be back and I don't suggest they be allowed to continue to tarnish such an established name."}
{"text":"Alright, I would have given this place  a 5 star rating, because to date this is the best sushi I have had!
Now I'm not just some beginner in the sushi world, Im well traveled I have had sushi across the country a few times in Canada and allot in Australia. This place combines Great service with Good prices and personable people. you wont regret it if you eat here! get something you have never tried before and sit at the bar talk to the chefs they are really cool! ask for the \"Real Wasabi\" and order a hand roll and the mackerel.
Magnificent!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I come here every Friday, I have for the past 2 months and I'm not going to stop. Inviting atmosphere, friendly employees, great sushi and good prices. I really love how it's so easy to unwind here after a long work week, this place makes me appreciate treating myself. Great start to a weekend and the perfect environment to bring your family or friends. Highly recommended. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! I had a total craving for sushi and found this place had good reviews here on yelp.  I was skeptical as I usually have sushi at fancy Scottsdale places, but seeing as it was so close to home, I gave it awhirl.  The restaurant boasts an \"A\" rating and though it was was super simple inside, the sushi tasted so fresh and was amazing.  I will be back soon and absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really awesome sushi with a cool thing they have going on there. We enjoy this place greatly and will come back I'm sure many times! Great wife selection of sushi!"}
{"text":"Cheap sushi no longer means you'll get sick! This place has some amazing deals and some amazing sushi. You can't go wrong. The service, ambiance, taste, and speed of getting food is all top notch and I will come here again and again. They are easily as good as the bigger sushi places downtown that take twice as long to drive to and cost twice as much"}
{"text":"Finally found a place I can grab sushi that doesn't cost a fortune... tastes so fresh and has a relaxed atmosphere. We will definitely be back. Service was just a little slow but as long as I plan for the time than no worries.. as I said before Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Our first time going to sushi ave we were hesitant about trying a new sushi place. But overall the food was amazing, the service was good and it had a great environment. Small restaurant, good for talking and socializing. At the end of our dinner our server brought over a little complimentary dessert, it was a small orange drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with whip cream. It was simple but delicious. We enjoyed our dinner and recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi around. Staff is friendly food is fresh and DELISH! I love that they have the fresh wasabi-not everyone does. Just getting Salmon and Tuna sushimi tonight with fresh wasabi yet I usually get the seaweed salad. It's INCREDIBLY delicious! I love their rolls and their calamari as well. They have a nice selection of sakes as well!"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok service was horrendous. Went in there with our kids and the lady was very annoyed. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Ate at this place today.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got a salmon roll, yellow tail roll and another type of roll that I can't remember the name of right now since I have dementia already stetting in.  Anyways, each roll was not cut correctly - some pieces were very big and some pieces had where the rice was not entirely covered by seaweed because of the improper cutting.   The seaweed also tasted very unfresh. 

In addition, I ordered some three appetizers.   The first, appetizer was some roasted peppers.  Unfortunately, the description in the menu didn't match the taste.  The peppers were mostly tough and didn't have much taste, surprising for a pepper.  The second appetizer was a yellow tail collar.  The collar had an off taste indicating it was not fresh.  

However, it wasn't all bad.  I got some tofu that was deep fried that was decent.  The only problem is that the tofu lost most of the crunchiness because it was swimming in some sauce."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant around! They also have wonderful orange chicken and yaki soba. They have great happy hour specials and their sushi is always fresh. If you like sake, try their raspberry sake, it's wonderful, lightly sweet and just right. You won't be disappointed with this little gem in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great food and great service every time we stop by. This is our go to date night spot. Happy Hour is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants! They're baked rolls are amazing!!! And they have infused sake which is fantastic!! I love the variety and their service is fast!! Worth the drive :)"}
{"text":"It is easy to miss this spot since it's tucked in a strip mall, but the staff are friendly and the sushi is tasty. A great alternative to the overcrowded, overpriced Scottsdale sushi bars."}
{"text":"Ever since our fave sushi spot jumped the shark, we've been on the hunt for another gem!  We decided on a lazy Monday night to finally try this place out.  We walked in and saw all the little bottles with regular customer's chop sticks- super nice touch!  The place is small and intimate! A few TVs and bar seating where you can watch the sushi chef prepare the rolls.  We ordered potstickers, Alaska roll, shrimp tempura roll, salmon sashimi, spicy tuna and salmon rolls.  The potstickers took a while to come out, but they were worth the wait.  The sashimi was excellent and super fresh!  They lose some points on presentation of the tempura and spicy rolls, as they were all jumbled together on a plate; but the Alaska, which came out a good 10 minutes later was like picture perfect, complete with an expertly carved lemon! That roll stole the show.  Delicious!  The only thing that wasn't up to par was the tempura roll. It just didn't have any flavor.  And the crab mix inside, with the yum yum sauce was a bit off putting and made the roll mushy.  So if you're a real sushi lover who doesn't wuss out and order tempura rolls, you'll love this place!  We will certainly go again, and proceed to order some of the freshest sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ave ranks as not only one of the best sushi spots in town, but their happy hour makes them the best deal as well. All of their sushi is great, but I especially love the Ultimate California. If you're more into your fish, their sashimi is always fresh and it's only 6 bucks during happy hour. Happy hour lasts until 7, but they also have lunch happy hour. Lastly, they throw in an orange dessert for free! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just came in on an off day or what. Friday happy hour... Decent happy hour menu. We ordered a bunch of salmon nigiri and then a sashimi B plate. It was like $30 for 20 pieces of sashimi. We thought: yeah! Great deal! They do not have gluten free soy sauce. They don't give you any ginger. Wasabi paste was awful and stale tasting. The salmon nigiri was pretty great and we loved it, so we were so excited to try our sashimi plate. Ugh! The yellowtail was tough and dry, the salmon had a slimy white substance on it, the albacore was good but sliced so it was sinewy and not melt in your mouth like it is supposed to be. The whole plate was drenched in some kind of light brown liquid... Not really what I'm expecting when I order sashimi. Tataki, sure. But this liquid pooled in the middle of the plate and didn't really taste like anything. We did not finish our food, taking bites of this sub par fish grossed us out (we eat sashimi and nigiri weekly so this is not a new food to us). The plus side was the waitress was very nice and cheery. She didn't seem to notice we didn't finish our food. This place was a waste of $70... I do understand places have off days but I don't believe I will eat here again. The place is super dark so you can barely see what you're eating... Also the bathroom was pretty dirty for it being 3pm."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love sushi Ave its very family friendly with prices that don't rob your wallet..the environment is very calming and enjoyable the food well is AMAZING by far the best sushi I have had in Arizona it always taste fresh like being in California and right down the street from the fish market you can't get better than that... we have become regulars here so thank you to the sushi Ave family you all are doing a great job"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and has great quality sushi. Recently there was a Facebook group discussing best sushi in gilbert and half the people said sushi avenue. Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was some of the best Sushi I have ever had. Got it in a groupon and was beyond thrilled. If you love sushi this will be your new spot. Hands down."}
{"text":"I've always known that this has been a \"members' only\" type of place where the regulars get astonishingly preferential treatment and everybody else is treated like aliens from another solar system dressed in Earthen 70s disco attire, but I never cared because the food was fresh, delicious, and of good quality.

But the last two times I was here, it was just unacceptable. Our party would order our food and see people seated and served who came in 30 minutes after we ordered. I don't mind \"unfriendly\" service (I really don't require a smile and dance from my servers), but it has become almost insulting.

Also, portions have lessened, I've noticed. The quality is still good, which is the reason for the two stars, but it seems that the management doesn't care to keep newish or infrequent customers. The chefs do care about the quality of food they serve to their customers, but they don't seem to care about their potential regular customers."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant!! We come all the time, and they have THE BEST happy hour deals! Great customer service and they bring out your food super fast! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch at Sushi Ave and had a fabulous experience.  My sister ordered the Bento Box with Teriyaki Beef and almost licked the box clean.  I ordered the Jalapeno Roll and Rainbow Roll and both were delicious.  The Jalapeno Roll with just a hint of crunch was amazing.  I am not from that area and will definitely go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is really great! The happy hour menu is limited but there is enough variety to satisfy, and the pricing is affordable. Overall, it's one of my favorites in the area. This is \"the spot\" for my GF and I when we don't want to cook but don't want to break the bank. A hearty must try."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place.  I go as often as I can. Certainly some dishes are better than others, but I have never been disappointed.  Some of my favorites are:  albacore tataki, spicy tuna roll, and anything with scallops.  Non-sushi food is also good: tempura, green lip mussels, agadashi tofu, and gyoza frequent my plate.  Full Japanese menu in addition to sushi.  Not sure if they have a full bar but beer, sake, and Japanese wine are available.

It can get packed during the dinner hour, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so I mostly go for lunch.  Service is always good and friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time at sushi ave. I thought took my boys and they loved it. We are gluten free in our house and our server and staff were very knowledgeable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents. We ordered the shrimp fried rice, agadashi tofu, sake kama (grilled salmon appetizer), coconut shrimp, a California roll, and a vegetarian roll. Everything tasted great! The fried rice was my favorite. And this was one of the best vegetarian rolls I've ever had. Not boring at all. My dad enjoyed the house sake with his food. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fruit flavored Sake, friendly staff, and prompt food. Happy Hour menu is great and served until 7pm!! Plus, you can get your own chopsticks and use them every time you come!"}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre. I do like their variety. Service was great. I just wish they'd work on one thing... My experience there was okay for my first time and the moment you step in to wash up its a nasty disappointment. I am huge on cleanliness and a restaurant should always have a clean restroom. If they can't maintain that for their customers and staff what's it to say about their kitchen? Just a thought. Not sure I'll ever go back. If they'd fix that issue it'd be a perfect little local spot."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Phoenix hands down. Great place and great people.  We have been coming here all the time and it is always great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great little place that has the best Sushi chef!  I have to admit, I knew the sushi chef from a former restaurant and so we went there to check out his new place.  Get to know this guy and he'll take care of you!

I went here for the first time last week with a friend and the vibe is very laid back and relaxed.  Very clean and neat little place too.  We each ordered an appetizer- the mushrooms for me, the fried peppers for him.  The mushrooms were tasty, but the peppers were the best I'd ever had! 

We then each ordered a couple of rolls and then a sashimi appetizer.  I ordered the avocado roll, the eel roll and one other roll I can't remember.   I know they are kind of basic, but that's what really shows the quality of the ingredients.  The sashimi appetizer had several different types of sashimi and all the fish was fresh and simply, but nicely, presented. 

The prices were very reasonable for what we ordered as well.  

The little thing that was a big selling point, to me, about this place was the menu.  Everything was clearly pictured and had the roll ingredients for each roll.  For someone with food allergies and who is picky about my food combinations,  this was a BIG help for me!  This is also a big help to those not too familiar with sushi, but want to try something new.

All in all, a great experience.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It was my first time here and I'm so impressed with their sushi and roll selection as well as their lunch and dinner options! We got potstickers that were crispy and delicious! My mom got the fried rice with chicken and got a salad and miso soup included. The salad had a yummy soy sauce-like dressing which was so good! I got the traditional California Roll as well as a Tootsie Roll and they both were so good! Service was awesome! At the end, we got complementary dessert oranges. The waitress gave me one with honey, since I can't have whipped cream or chocolate - which is what my mom got on hers! My honey orange was delicious! I love everything about this place. Great vibes, great food, great service, and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a terrible place. Came here and ordered 4 rolls.  The first one came out,  the second came out 5 minutes later and then we sat for 30 minutes and still didn't see the third or fourth.  Mind you the last 2  were vegetables rolls... The easiest roll to make.  The service was terrible,  and the server had no idea what the food was that she was serving.  The sushi was just ok.  Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very nice waitress. Good atmosphere. Like to go for the happy hour specials."}
{"text":"So far so good. The people were nice and there is a free appetizer if you write a review. I haven't trIed any of the food yet so I'll be back after we eat something. For now I'm listening to my 11 year old daughter argue with her mom about how to find the area of a triangle. I may need a saki bomber."}
{"text":"The sushi here was great!  Service could have been better but the food definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"This place has excellent taste in sushi! They have the best chicken teriyaki roll that no other restaurant has come close to. The service is always great and friendly and the food is fresh and unique. 

Little tucked away restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  But above N. Scottsdale prices!   Can't afford to eat sushi at these prices very often. Service was okay. Sushi chef was friendly and offered yummy suggestions."}
{"text":"Loved this place and their food but the last couple times I've been by, they have been very inattentive and even forgotten that they put in my order. This past time I came in with a drink so it didn't melt in my car and they were very rude about it when I clearly told them I wasn't drinking it as it would just be sitting inside instead of my 100 degree car. The food is good but the staff could be nicer"}
{"text":"We love sushi ave! It's our go to place for sushi plus their happy hour is amazing! We love the Las Vegas roll and their simple creamy California roll! We had the Arizona roll tonight and it was for sure added to our top list! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Favorite sushi!! Love it, has a great happy hour!! My son's brought us here and we've been back twice.  The quality is fresh. Service is always superb....would recommend to other family members and friends. Jalape√±o roll is my favorite, but their all good."}
{"text":"Awesome people
Awesome food 
Never disappoints me whenever I come here!
This is my third time here this week 
Shoutout to the servers !  Heather & Hannah !
I feel like this place is definitely underrated 
More people should come here"}
{"text":"Great prices, yummy sushi. I love their California crunch roll with eel sauce and their Hawaiian chicken."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is a great spot for good sushi. The happy hour has excellent prices. The California crunch is my family's favorite! Their desert orange is a really nice touch too!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ave has great, like their name says, sushi! I got salmon sushi as well as California rolls and they were both out of this world! The potstickers were awesome too! Great fast service and friendly servers... 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Sushi Ave for some time, I was upset that my friend sold the place and moved away. I was glad to see that most of the menu is still the same but the quality did fall at first.  I have been back a few times and the new owners are starting to win me over.  Some rolls are just about as I remember them but, some of the more specialty rolls that I  loved are not there yet. One of the things I do like that has not changed is the rolls are rolled smaller, not hard to eat, kind of bite sized.  The rolls are longer so you are not cheated and it makes it easier to eat 

Over all this is still my favorite place to go in the East Valley. Try the Arizona roll, it's not as good as it used to be but still very tasty.  

We miss you James"}
{"text":"Apparently, the Tempe \"Kampai\" is a different restaurant from this one. But, I can't find the Kampai Mill Ave. spot on here.  So, if you are looking for info about the Kampai Tempe, here is my reviewAwesome place.  Had some low expectations because it is in a big space on Mill Ave., and the tile floors and bright light didn't scream quality.  But, that fish was outstanding!  I love a creative, spicy roll with lots of fish, and I have been missing that since Zen 32 closed (sob).  There was a lot of variety on the menu, and just the yellowtail shashimi was buttery, and perfect.  The sushi chefs were friendly, didn't hand us too many dishes too fast, and put made them in a pleasing order.  I think my favorite was the surf and turf roll (the beef slices finished off with a torch - nice touch!)  Happy hour pricing is fantastic.  And I found a new delight: seaweed salad.  Nice krinkly, poppy texture, great seasoning, plus some cucumbers thrown in.  I wish I loved closer!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Hannah and delicious food! Will return!

Great fish and it was incredibly fresh. I recommend the seaweed salad and specialty roll!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have sushi for lunch, Mon-Fri 11 AM to 2 PM happy hour, nice and quiet, sushi tastes fresh and rolls are creative, love it!!"}
{"text":"Rolling tiger roll is the best sushi roll I've ever had. I have not had a bad sushi roll at this restaurant. You will enjoy it. Unique rolls and quality sushi."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at Sushi Ave tonight with my family. Nice food and kind people. 
I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We're so lucky Sushi Ave is close to our house! Sushi is delicious and served quickly by friendly staff. Bento box lunch specials are a great deal and you get more than enough food.  Be sure to drop by for the happy hour deals too."}
{"text":"Tried Sushi Ave tonight, food is excellent! Hidden little place off Higley.  Service was also wonderful.  Will definitely back!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch and tried the bento boxes and a couple of the specialty rolls.  Everything was very good.  The teriyaki beef was better than most I've tried.

Also, the decor was a perfect mix of dark wood, Japanese accents, and modern feel.  Will definitely be back, perhaps to try out the happy hour."}
{"text":"The sushi made by Mihwa was amazing! And the service was great from Colin. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Fall From Sushi Grace!! 
Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now."}
{"text":"Really good food, great prices... you should try if you're looking for sushi in the east valley"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Will definitely return!! The ponzu sauce is to die for and the fish is so fresh!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed this place. I went when they first opened so it was obviously not crowded, but the service was nice and the food was delicious. I ordered a bento box and my husband ordered a few different types of sushi. I devoured my food and ate most of his sushi. We ended up sticking to ordinary dishes and am so impressed I can't wait to try some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.. A little expensive but a great treat every now and then
We ordered the Las Vegas rolls and didn't expect the fried veggies to come with but they were an amazing treat with the rolls"}
{"text":"The sushi was suprisingly fresh and tasty both times I went here! The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"We are new to AZ and have tried several sushi places. We finally found our new home! My wife and I love this place! It has the best happy hour.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Great decor, great food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Salmon teriyaki Bento box for lunch special and it was perfect! Always come back here for authentic japanese food.."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 rating.  Went on friday night and it  was about half full.  girlfriend and i sat at the bar. 

cons: 1. somehow they messed up our order and gave it to someone next to us, who ordered after us.  they figured it out and gave it  back to us   2.  I had to ask for ginger, which is pretty lame, and then they only gave us one btwn the two of us.  the ginger is also unusually sweet, as they marinate it a second time.  i just like the original, white, uncolored ginger.  3.  Ordered the pink lady roll, and i am still trying to figure out what the pink stuff on the outside of it

pros:  double spicy roll (spicy tuna inside and out), new york roll (spicy salmon and other stuff that is whole roll tempura fried), and salmon nigiri.  Salmon was awesome!  fatty, perfectly cut, and not old and dry.  the rolls aren't loaded with rice that make you feel stuffed and take away from flavor.

definitely i will go back to see how it goes a second time.  japanese gf made a good point that almost every roll has imitation crab which makes it lower quality and makes rolls look bigger."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Good service. Great casual place to just have some sushi.  Nothing really special but like a good staple."}
{"text":"Las Vegas, new york and dynamite rolls delicious.  Very reasonable happy hour prices and from 4-7 so great time frame. Great sushi will come again"}
{"text":"Best sushi around! Fast, friendly and great quality.  Our favorite part is you get to pick your own chop sticks, name them, put them in a little jar and then pick them off a shelf on your way in-every time."}
{"text":"I had eyeballed this place many many times as I drove down Bell road. This past week I was so tired and hungry, I decided to stop in finally. 

The interior isn't anything special. The whole dining area is a sea of teal and warm wood. The dining room wasn't too full the night we went there- which is probably a good thing, as the service was kinda slow. 

We ended up getting Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura Udon. Mainly because there wasn't much else on the menu that I could find to eat. Most of the non-sushi items were deep fried in some manner, or they were boring teriyaki. My companion normally gets sushi, but he told me that there was a bunch of un-needed and weird crap in each of the rolls. And he didn't want to spend money on something he'd hate. 

His teriyaki chicken came with miso and salad. The miso was rather mild, for better or worse. The salad had too much dressing on it, imo. The dressing itself was okay, but nothing exceptional. 

When the main courses came out the chicken was dry, the sauce was thin and tasted like slightly sweetened soy. My udon wasn't bad (surprise) but it had spice in it (something not mentioned in the menu) and I couldn't really enjoy the broth- as my mouth caught on fire (I'm a wuss). If you're into that sort of thing, the udon is probably very good. I did like the shrimp- it was firm and tasty. The noodles were done to a fairly nice texture. 

Overall, Kampai seems to be a good place for sushi, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wants something that is not sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi! Their lunch menu is also really cheap with lots of good rolls to choose from! I have never had a bad roll here!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Excellent food and service.  Looking forward to more visits.  Very extensive menu.  Exceptionally clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"I had never tried sushi until I moved to the Valley 3 years ago. I since have become a huge fan. This very restaurant played a huge role in this. Every time I eat there I get about 5 rolls for my girlfriend and I to share. It fills you up and it doesn't break the bank in the process. The atmosphere is very nice as well, dark modern furnishings throughout. The owners are so nice there as well, welcoming each customer with a genuine smile and greeting. Overall: Great place to grab some sushi."}
{"text":"For my purpose, quick tasty sushi at a great price, this place is perfect. Service is fine. It's not somewhere I would take people to impress them with the ambiance, which is nice if not upscale, but I come here after work all the time when I can hit happy hour which is mon-fri 3-6 and 8-close."}
{"text":"I likethis pace becuase it is kind of like mom and pop place I frequented in Tokyo a few years back....

However, the sushi is just OK and a little pricey considering the ambience.   The service is prompt and efficient. 

We shared a sushi platter that was a liitle flat taste wise and even the unagi tasted a little off.... 

On the plus side, they are open on Sundays!   That is the reason we ended up there as they are WAY down our list of places to frequent for sushi....

I have been here on multiple occasions... it is definitely NOT my first choice but not a bed second if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"What a gem!! Can't believe I have never been here. Great food, great price, great service. TRIFECTA!"}
{"text":"DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL THESE HATERS WHO MISS THE OLD MANAGEMENT!!!  The change could not have been better in my opinion!  Under the old management, it felt really tense, awkward, and unfriendly.  The sushi chefs, especially the older man, would simply not talk with anyone at the sushi bar seating; you basically had to FORCE conversation on them to fill the uncomfortable silence, provided you were outgoing enough to break the ice.  Every time you needed something, it was unclear who to ask, and you felt like a pest.  The selection of food items was super limited and weak; especially the rolls.  There was only a short list of rolls, and most of them were kinda lackluster.  I recently decided to give the place another try, and was pleasantly surprised....no, BLOWN AWAY by the new management!  They were playing rock music, a nice lady greeted me, and the new sushi chef \"Kasper\" is literally the COOLEST AND MOST INTERESTING CHEF I HAVE EVER TALKED TO!!!  We hit it off so well right away that he made me an amazing custom roll that he let me design myself, and we quickly became Facebook friends. He'll treat you so well and make you feel so comfortable that you'll want to leave him a much-deserved big tip.  The menu has been expanded to include a huge selection of awesome, tasty, creative, modern rolls.  Trust me, I eat a lot of sushi and have tried most places in the valley, and you won't get this kind of low-key, one-on-one experience anywhere else!  This place now RULES!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Ave. They have always delivered on amazing sushi. Their rainbow roll is awesome and their staff is great. The are quick and their food is delicious. We will definitely continue to go. Their prices are average for sushi"}
{"text":"Supper amaizing sushi. Staff was friendly and helpful.  The chef answered all our questions and made the sushi right in front of us. The price is affordable and the atmosphere is fresh.  Best sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Yes, the service here is still bad, bad, bad. But it is the closest sushi place to my house and the quality of the food is pretty good. So what I do now is order take-out, and show up 10 minutes after they say it will be ready. Sometimes I still wait a few minutes. But if you are prepared for this it's not too bad because the sushi is good. And the staff is very friendly. I had to bump this review up to 3 stars because the quality of sushi. If they would work on their service I would bump it up to a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Best sushi around! I highly recommend the Arizona roll, you will not be let down! Great service with very friendly staff. Happy Hour specials are a good deal and very filling"}
{"text":"The rolls here are amazing! We made it here for happy hour and tried a number of different rolls. Each one was incredible! Quality ingredients, quality facilities, and plenty of variety. Great service and a clean, inviting ambience to go with it. I eat a lot of sushi and can highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and this use to be the place we chose over everything in Phoenix. What happened.? Please hire smarter."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall behind the Whataburger.  I stopped in on a whim and have gone back again and again.  They have a 1/2 price menu 4-7pm Monday-Saturday that I'm working through and their full price fare is still a great value.  Try the cucumber salad."}
{"text":"This is easily the best sushi I've found out here. My wife and I frequently visit and are never disappointed. The service is excellent and the sushi is well-prepared and tastes great! You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We found it by chance about 5 years ago and it is now our go-to date night escape.  We love the sushi (especially sashimi) and the rolls (Mango Roll and King Kong!!).  We also occasionally enjoy some of their Korean food (Kim chee or Galbi).  After the meal they serve a small orange and whip cream dessert that finishes thing off just right!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy well prepared, fresh Sushi..do not go here.  For lunch, I stopped in on a Saturday at 1:30, and only one table besides mine in the place. I had the lunch special. Miso soup was good. Only thing that stood out.Dressing on salad was good, but it was a miniature salad in a tea cup with TONS of spines of romaine. Chose sashimi (NO SUBSTITUTIONS in caps on the menu) with one roll..I chose eel and cucumber.  The fish was cut to different thickness for EVERY cut. LOUSY. The snapper was good and cut wafer thin, tuna was stringy and cut like a square, the salmon was the worst and cut very thick and like a square.  the The roll was loose and fell apart. Eel was MINUTE. I'm serious, it was a nibble of a 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch of eel.  If you don't have eel TAKE IT THE FREAK OFF THE MENU. Also, I've tasted many eel rolls in my time. This...not fresh and the sauce that accompanies was WAY too sweet.  They have Ginger and wasabi at the table when you walk in. I find this weird and what is to say that someone doesn't stick their chopsticks in there after it's been in their mouth?  UNSANITARY.  The wasabi was VERY bland. NO KICK. I inquired when the waitress finally came to check on me and she said \"Would you like FRESH WASABI?  I was thinking WTF am I eating 4 day old stuff?  Ick. They had METAL CHOP STICKS. Again WTF? Too cheap for wood sticks. Not cool. Not natural. When they bring you your check they served a slice of orange which is traditional..BUT they SLATHERED it with some fake chocolate sauce and STALE, not natural WHIPPED CREAM. Just GROSS.  Also the place was SWEATY hot. Just BAD and I wished I'd saved my hard earned cash. The ginger and wasabi on the table should have alerted me to leave, but I was hungry. Sent back the dish with some fish still on it.Will not return. EVER."}
{"text":"This is a very good happy hour sushi bar.Their sushi is better than most. Service is Good most of the time if it is the owners they are awesome."}
{"text":"Bento box is fantastic. My wife loved the teriyaki chicken. California roll was great. Crunchy pot stockers. Yummy orange dessert!"}
{"text":"What used to be arguably the best sushi place in PHX is now one of, if not the, worst. So sad to lose the old Kampai."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and the service has always been responsive. I really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! I love the happy hour menu always great options. Wonderful staff feel super welcome. Definitely one of my favorite local sushi spots, always pleased."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and we were so happy to have found Sushi Ave. As you walk into this neighborhood restaurant, you can't help but notice the wall lined with customers' personal chopsticks. The music playing added to the atmosphere. The service was great, the food was tasty, and it will become one of our regular hangouts."}
{"text":"I looooove me some good, cheap sushi and this is the place to get it! It's better than good! My friends and I have come here quite a few times and we enjoy it every time. Great fast and friendly customer service, and tasty sake bombs! I'll continue to bring my friends here for our sushi dates. Thank you sushi Ave staff! :)"}
{"text":"If your in the East Valley this is the sushi place you have to go to! They have nice staff, and the best tasting sushi I've ever had! My favorite roll is the Rolling tiger! And they have a great Vegas roll to! 

Anyway sushi ave is a great place to go and you won't spend to much either, We usually get about 4 rolls for 20 buck in happy hour plus because we frequent so often we have our own chopsticks! #swag #sushi4days"}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited this spot on a Thursday evening around 8pm. Based on reviews, we were expecting a very positive experience. Although it was a little late for dinner there were still a handful of parties in the restaurant and many sounded like regulars...a good sign in our eyes.

We were seated in our requested booth and our server was very pleasant as she immediately brought us our tea/waters and took our order. We ordered 3 rolls and sashimi between us and an order of vegetable tempura. 

The fish was of good quality and tasted very fresh. The balance of flavor in each roll was just right. One thing we noticed was how loosely the sushi was rolled. Each piece had the tendency to fall apart and trust, we know how to use chopsticks. The sushi just wasn't rolled up very tightly. Not a bad thing per se since it didn't affect the taste at all but just a tad annoying. 

The other thing we noticed was how long it took for our sushi to arrive. Again, not necessarily a bad thing because we were enjoying dinner together but it still would have been nice to have some of our sushi come out earlier than the others so that we could eat and converse at the same time.

All in all, it's a quaint restaurant with good tasting sushi and a nice vibe. If we are in the area again and craving sushi we would probably go back."}
{"text":"Great place! Delicious sushi and friendly service. LOVE spicy tuna with avocado and philly cheese, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is fantastic, I highly recommend their happy hour. Cheap beers, great selection of appetizers and rolls, a super friendly atmosphere and it's super delicious. We plan on making this our go-to sushi place."}
{"text":"We have always gotten good service, they have a great selection of sushi, and all day everyday happy hour!! This is the spot."}
{"text":"This place is nestled in a little strip mall next to AMF. The happy hour menu is unbelievable, great prices and the sushi is always fresh. Get here before 7 and it's all good!!! Sake bomber is a screaming deal too"}
{"text":"Our favorite local sushi restaurant. Great service from  walk-in till end. Love going for Happy Hour. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We ordered the special called the over the Rainbow roll. It was amazing! Apparently it can be ordered any time but it is not on the menu. Same for all of the weekly specials. Service was friendly, the tuna poke was really fresh and tasty. This was our first time here but will definitely be back. Plus they have happy hour from 8 until close."}
{"text":"Love sushi here. We will come back soon :) my boyfriend really loves it and now it will be our favorite sushi place. Keep finding more kinds of good food here. The service is so good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the prices are reasonable. My fianc√© and I came in on a Friday afternoon for lunch and it was not noisy. Not a lot of people, but don't let that fool you. This place is very much worth trying."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! I got food poisoning from the sushi last week! I just moved here and literally searched quite a few sushi restaurants and chose this place due to their reviews. Sadly, the next day and 4 days continuing with only what you could imagine from food poisoning! (will not get graphic). They might not store their Sushi how it should be stored or get it fresh. (Not sure). It was quite dry and they messed up when asking for soy paper. We took the Sushi to go and my boyfriend ordered an item with shrimp. Also, when he arrived to pick up our order they said they were out of the item he ordered. Instead of offering to make him something else they were quick to make him pay and send him on his way."}
{"text":"No one can top fresh just caught sushi, served up on the sea wall in Okinawa with a bottle of Kirin.  HOWEVER, Sushi Ave is pretty close.  Smaller scale than most, cozy.  Great selection."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for many years , this place is one the best restaurant & trust me I have tried many japanese reastuants around State and outside U.S.A , all rolls are fresh,high quality, not too dry , not too small size

Staff is very friendly & good service 
Reasonal price for food you get"}
{"text":"Solid sushi.  Great and friendly service.  Their happy hour deals are top notch, so many great deals.  Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Does it taste good? Yes. Is it good sushi? Not really. Too much sauce/creams and deep fried items. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things because it didn't taste fresh the way sushi should. There's better places out there."}
{"text":"We usually frequent with this place once or twice a month food is good but the service is not.
The servers never refill your drinks,
Never check on you.
They take your order and vanish.
We loved the food so we kept going anyway and the prices are great for happy hour.
But we went there tonight and waited 45 minutes for our food in an in uncrowded restaurant.
They said they had a huge to go order when we asked .
We wanted to talk to the manager and he or she wouldn't come out for  couple mins and talk to us.
She told the server to task us if we could wait 15 more
Minutes to speak to her or him.
Thought that was kind of lame.
We won't go back there ever again."}
{"text":"I regularly go to this place for lunch with a group of co-workers. We usually get there around 11:30 a.m.  I am always amazed that this location is never busy. 

This is one of my favorite locations in town. I can't say that I have ever had bad food during my visits. 

Again, today, 5 of the guys went in for lunch. Ordered seveal orders of sashimi, nigiri, and about 6 rolls.  All tasted very good.  We were also served two complimentary orders of pot stickers.  I pretty sure because of the slow service. 

My favorite is the Hawaian Role and Samurai Roll.  The Jalapeno Role is also good. 

My only complaint was that the food prep was a little slow. There was only one sushi chef and she clearly had a hard time keeping up with order. Now, I can understand if the place was packed, but when you are the only group in the restaurant, I would think the roles would come flying out!!!  Getting there at 11:00 a.m. we did not get out until almost 12:30 p.m.  A little too long for the only group in the place. 

Reading prior reviews, I learned that the place is under new management.  And it was a different chef behind the bar than the person from previous visit.  So maybe we are still developing skills. 

Will continue to visit. Food has always been good regardless owner.  Don't always want to spend 1 1/2 hour for lunch.

Would be 5 Stars.  But due to slower service today, taking away one star..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for their happy hour. The dynamite roll is on the happy hour menu and it is probably just about the most amazing sushi roll I've ever tasted in my life.  Not to mention the inside of this place is adorable and the staff is friendly as ever :) The happy hour has some great rolls on it and it's a good price, plus I saw they have happy hour all day during the summer! Cheap sushi that's good is always a great find!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and we are very impressed with the food, service and atmosphere. Happy Hour has good prices. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been going there for 14 years! Uki son the owner was an amazing chef with the finest quality of sushi, amazing authentic rolls, like the Kampai roll, tgeir albacore tataki with their special sauce is to die for. The muscles with its own authentic taste was amazing! Now under new ownership and the quality of sushi decreased and its noticeable significantly, we gave it a 4 time try with the new owner BUT finally stopped wasting our money!!! The sushi chef drank and ate behind the counter while making sushi, did not wash his hands and it disgusted me! I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I WANT TO LET OTHERS KNOW!!! Dont waste your $$$$"}
{"text":"Place is clean. Ambience is good, and music is soothing. There is a tv on the wall for entertainment. Food is great, service is quick."}
{"text":"My Husband and I found Kampai after looking on the internet for exceptional Sushi places in the valley. From the outside, it looks like a hole-in-the-wall place not to be remembered, however that is certainly not the case here. After being dissapointed by every other place, we quickly discovered that KAMPAI IS THE BEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA!!! 
MY husband and I went there the whole time I was pregnant (I had Cal. Rolls and other cooked rolls for those of you whose mouths dropped when I said that) and every time we came in they asked how I was doing and talked to us like they were our best friends (And I do consider them our friends), anywho, when my son was born and we brought him in for the first time, all of the chefs came out from around the bar to look at him and meet him. We have taken him there alot since he was born (over 2 years now) and we have never had an issue with him and THEY ARE GREAT WITH KIDS!!! AJI, Uki, EJ, And Anthony are amazing and the sushi is out of this world. They are truely rivaled by none, Anytime my husband and I go to a sushi restaurant (even in New York and San Diego) we can never find a better Sushi Place than KAMPAI!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since my original review. The staff is always friendly (Hannah is super awesome), and most (if not all) of the food I've had since my last review has been above average (good to great, depending on the item). It seems that I simply ordered the wrong menu items on my first visit (I haven't tried the yakisoba again, but that doesn't really seem to be \"the thing\" to eat here anyway; stick to the sushi). The Dynamite roll is great, my new favorite."}
{"text":"If you or the person you take out knows and loves authentic & very fresh sushi at very reasonable prices then this is the place to go. The chefs behind the bar speak Japanese and not Spanish. While they don't do alot of fancy custom \"Americanized\" rolls like some Scottsdale douche was complaining about, their sashimi is amazing! Try the Toro \"fatty\" tuna and the seared tataki is the best I've ever had (Over 80 diff sushi places coast to coast)
 
Of all the places I've ever had sushi if I could only pick one to eat at on a regular basis then Kampai would be that choice hands down.
 
When I do out on a date this is one of my top choices of places to eat."}
{"text":"We live close to Sushi Avenue and discovered it not long after it opened and have been regulars ever since. It's small, quiet and serves terrific sushi. The service is great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour to go along with their well made sushi. The sushi is an excellent value. Don't be fooled by the auto parts store nearby, this is a nice joint once you step inside. Give this place a try, you can't go wrong with any of the menu options. Who says you can't have sushi in Arizona?!"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!
Great service !!
Try the Phoenix Suns Roll 
The Ultimate Shrimp Roll
The Tuna tataki Roll"}
{"text":"I really can't remember what I got here several years ago, but I met up here with my cousin with our dates and we were the only ones getting the sushi, which was some of the first I ever had and got me into liking sushi. I remember it being good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food has always been wonderful.  Love their unique Southwest Salmon Roll!  Service is uneven (excellent last visit, though not always), but it's worth tolerating for the great food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent sushi bar and so friendly. It may not be surprised busy during the day every day but it makes it so much intimate. The large selection of food is amazing and they are always quick on their to-go orders either by phone, in-person,'or through yelp takeout. They will even call if something comes up. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome lunch specials. Their Jalape√±o Roll is my all time fav! Also try the dynamite roll, it will blow your mind... see what I did there? Sushi Ave customer for life!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here for take out once before and really liked it, but tonight was our first night dining in. I got two fried Philly rolls, and my husband got a teriyaki honey spicy chicken entree, with some edamame and miso soup on the side. It was all really good and decently priced! I was going to take a picture but I ate it too fast.  I also just found out they have a great happy hour menu for both lunch and dinner times. We'll be coming back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi restaurants in Phoenix!  they have a great happy hour and lunch deals! The salmon is particularly delicious and always tastes very fresh.  And my daughter really loves that you can pick out personal chopsticks.  Great place."}
{"text":"Really great sushi. I'm an avid sushi lover from LA and didn't expect to find great sushi all the way out here but it was really great and the sushi chef was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I came here after reading a few reviews and also since I am currently living about two blocks away.  When I walked in, I was surprised to see a very small crowd seated at the tables (which is a good sign in a way).  The main crowd was seated at the sushi bar.  So, I sat down at the far left seat where a \"local\" immediately asked me: \"Hey man, do you come here a lot?\"  Of course I answered \"no\" and told him this was my first time.  A grin immediately overcame his face and he proceeded with \"suggesting\" to me what to order.  Typically I don't like it when folks insist on eating what THEY eat.  However, this guy seemed so enthusiastic for me to try FLOUNDER and a SCALLOP that I could not say no.  As I waited for my food to come - the local INSISTED I try some of his freshly ordered makeral - which he insisted I try to eat some of the \"bones\" from his dish.  Of course I didn't want to insult him - so I ate the bones and smiled as I chewed.  Actually, it was not that bad.  The servers were nice and the chefs were fast and accomodating to my  requests of spiciness as far as the tuna HANDROLL was concerned.  I will probably come back to this place.  It was made clear to me that every single person sitting at the bar was a patron of not less than 5 years.  That IS a good sign of a good sushi place!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Got the spicy garlic tuna roll. The sauce that covered the roll with was so garlicky with hot spice that it wasn't a compliment to the rolls flavors at all. So I pushed the top of it aside to get to the spicy tuna and it tasted weird. I wonder if it was even tuna at all! 

The other roll was a mango salmon roll w cream cheese. Once again the salmon wasn't fresh and the crab that filled the roll was smothered in a extremely sweet sauce. I couldn't eat it. $28 thrown away,  soooo frustrating. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place!! The staff so awesome!! Always have a good time, spectacular food!!! Can't stay away ha-ha."}
{"text":"Sushi-AMAZING!  I have been coming here for almost 2 years (moved here a little over 2 years ago).  I have been to many Sushi joints including the 5 star posh restaurants all the way to the dingy.  This is by far the best in the Phoenix area.  The seafood is always very fresh, and they have market fresh specials all the time.  I always get something off the hand written board, which are the chef's specials or the items that are market fresh.  You should definitely sit at the sushi bar if seats are available.  The service at the tables is not the best, they don't have a very broad alcoholic beverage selection, the decor also not fabulous, the dingy strip mall surrounding it and all the pawn shops-awful....but, we came for sushi and WOW."}
{"text":"I had not been to Kampai in a while when I went for a birthday dinner on November 30th. Imagine my surprise to discover it was under new management (I should have read the recent reviews first). I was a fan of Kampai because it was possibly the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix.

The decor hasn't changed (which, frankly, could use some refreshing, like the seat cushions in the booths are sagging, but overall, is still quite serviceable and even charming), but the menu has changed radically and now includes an almost encyclopedic collection of \"maki\" sushi (sushi rolls), most of which seem be to calculated to appeal to western tastes. Think Philly and California rolls (along with Caterpillar rolls, Arizona rolls, etc.). Yes, you can still get sushi by the piece, but not sure if I'd bother, they didn't even have tamago (egg omelet) and the surf clam (both nigiri) we had fell apart. Perhaps they should stick with chirashizushi instead of nigiri. I also didn't think the sushi rice was well prepared or that the fish was properly chilled (it seemed a tad warm). I was not impressed.

Along with the sushi we also had a cucumber and seaweed salad (actually, sunomono) which was surprisingly good.

Compliments, however, to the wait staff as they were exceedingly attentive and food and drinks were served with a smile and promptly. The staff is probably what stopped me from leaving too quickly (the staff under previous management was always warm and welcoming and I miss them).

Now for the food coming out of the kitchen: Another delightful surprise, it was well executed. It was obvious to me that the tempura recipe was slightly different than previously, but it was well done and not greasy. A few details were off-putting, though, there was no gobo root in the vegetable mix and far too many slices of potato, and this time, pieces of chicken, too, which were a little stringy, I'd rather have had an additional shrimp (the large prawns were cut in half lengthwise and served in individually making the serving seem more generous than it was).

Also since the new management, the prices have risen rather steeply: Una-ju (eel over rice) is up sharply and several other items went up as well. Given recent economic times and the rise in restaurant prices, I'm not sure this is entirely fair, but some of the prices went up rather surprisingly high. It is easy, with drinks, to run to over $30.00 per person.

The new restaurant menu is all over the place: It appears that the new owners have tried to keep the core menu, but other additions make it seem disorganized, as if they are trying to please too many. The new menu has Fried rice, bulgogki, tempura, nabeyaki. Fried rice? And, yes, something like an encyclopedia of sushi rolls (2 pages worth).

I went to Kampai because it reminded me of restaurants when I was in Japan. It was not striving for fusion or pan-Asain cuisine, or tons of novelty - a new dish now and then, fine, but was a solid example of quietly typical Japanese cuisine; quality classic food and an intimate atmosphere rather than catering to western ideas of what sushi and Japanese food \"should\" be or giving into food fads. I was always gratified to see members of the local ex-pat Japanese community eating there. And now I don't know where to sate my addiction to Japanese cuisine. Any recommendations greatly appreciated, as I don't know if I will be back to the new Kampai."}
{"text":"I would like to first start off with their poor customer service that I received on 03/20/18. I was apart of a party of 3 and the host or owner (not sure) told us to follow him which we did; unfortunately, the table that he planned to seat us at wasn't available we continued to follow him to the opposite side of the restaurant where he didn't know where to seat us. The phone suddenly rung and he decided that a potential consumer on the phone was better than actual consumers in front of him? As we stood there in disbelief a young woman helped us finally to our seat (she would later be our waitress). Next is the food, my party did the buffet while I ordered spicy tuna rolls and Pad Thai, overall we loved all the rolls that we ordered as well as the orange chicken; however, the Mongolian beef was all onions with little beef and my Pad Thai was so abysmal the smell alone would disgust you! I decided to give it a try anyway and with one small bite I knew I couldn't continue it had a vinegar smell and taste and anyone who's had Pad Thai know that shouldn't be the case. I informed the waitress and she graciously removed it from our bill. In conclusion Two stars only because of the rolls and orange chicken; I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We love coming to Sushi Avenue! The prices are great especially during happy hour. We have been coming here for over Eight years. Service is great and food is even better!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's close to home, has a great atmosphere, and good sushi.

If the sushi was better, we would be in heaven and would eat there way too much. 

However, the sushi is good. Not great. We could eat there an be satisfied, but never really go \"wow, this is good.\"

Know what I mean?"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local sushi places. Good quality and selection, and not very expensive. We usually get sushi for takeout, and they've never had an order wrong (knock on wood)."}
{"text":"For sushi in the north valley, I'd take the drive to Sakana (NWC 59th Ave & 101) over this place.

I've been to this restaurant three times in as many years, and all three times there has been an odd chemical/fish smell when you walk in the door.  I didn't like it the first time, but I'm a believer that you should give a restaurant a couple of chances.  I did, and now I won't go back.

When I ordered their Las Vegas roll, it had scallions inside the roll; I'm not sure if this is usually what is in a Las Vegas roll, but I didn't like it."}
{"text":"Great sushi, nice environment, good appetizers. I will be back very soon! There are plenty of options on the menu. I tried their most spicey roll and it definitely has a kick, and I'm a spicey fan. The presentation is very nice as well."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a shot because they have a good looking happy hour, and it's very close to our home. My sister said their veggie roll was good. It was, but everything else was a disappointment.

There was only one other table occupied and a couple at the bar, yet our server was slow and forgot to bring out several items. Our sushi, something that relies on great presentation, was served on chipped white china. We're talking huge chips here. I can't believe they didn't throw the pieces out.

The food was all pretty bad. I got the egg nigiri, and it was the worst I've ever had. How do you screw up what is essentially an omelette on rice? My husband liked his pink lady roll (not on happy hour), but the 4 other rolls and nigiri he downed only out of ravenous hunger.

If you live in this area, stick with Sakana for well-priced decent sushi."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Gilbert, AZ! 

With sushi you never know if it is going to be fresh or not, but Sushi Ave always has the freshest ingredients. Also, the FREE dessert they give you at the end of your meal is delicious and unique.

Their regular and happy hour (Mon-Fri, 4p-7p) prices are perfect."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is great, but if you go during dinner hours expect to wait a while to even be greeted and then seated.  Then wait another LONG while for the sushi ( much longer than other sushi places) . They get very busy and are understaffed. We will go again but not during dinner time."}
{"text":"20 years for me and sad to see them go.  Sadder still to see a great traditional Japanese sushi restaurant end, and not carry on the tradition.  We would go here for consistently great fresh fish and great service.  They have also trained many young sushi chefs through the years here in Phoenix.  Great Japanese food isn't about fancy rolls and combinations, but about great fresh ingredients.  END OF AN ERA.  I agree."}
{"text":"Very good modern sushi place with great happy hour specials. The place was very busy on a Friday night, but we got seated within 8 minutes. The service was very fast and the quality of food was reasonable .  Good presentation as well.
I was disappointed that the didn't have the red bean ice cream that was on the menu."}
{"text":"This place would be a 5 star if the service was a bit better and the sushi roll size a bit bigger. The food and atmosphere were spot on. Truly enjoyed the taste of it, just disappointed on how small my California rolls were. I will definitely try this place again and update my review based off of my next visit. 

Lastly, they have a great happy hour and also serve liquor."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to Sushi Ave! Perfect place to get delicious sushi rolls and teriyaki chicken on a Saturday night! Our Las Vegas roll was super tasty and I loved their teriyaki chicken. The entree came with miso soup and the salad I love and you can definitely share since it's a big entree. We also got a free little dessert! 

Can't wait to come back for their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I had the Las Vegas Roll. I don't care for seafood that much, however, this was phenomenal. I ordered only one and ended up ordering another roll after my first bite. My boyfriend ordered the chicken yakisoba and loved it. Can't say it enough, this place is delicious."}
{"text":"An incredibly cute restaurant with delicious sushi! If you're a regular, you can have your own personal set of chopsticks that are displayed at the front. Will be coming here for a long time to come! Yay!"}
{"text":"My sister and I come here all the time and every time we're here the service is just as amazing as the food. This is our favorite place to come to for sushi because the food comes out very quick and is always incredible. If you're looking  for a good and local sushi place definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great, but the service lacked a little. We've only had dinner here one time so, the jury is still out on this place. I hear great things about theier happy hour so, we'll have to give that a shot the next time."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch - because I remembered this place was decent last time I went there a few years ago... I was so disappointed with the quality of the food. I read some reviews after I came home and now I know why - under the new management. All my sashimi tasted so old and the sushi rice was way too much vinegar in it. The server was nice but the food was bad. I will not go back there ever again. Too sad because it used to be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Hi. We love coming here everything they have is fantastic.  We enjoy eating here very much.  And swing by quite often. Thx again will be back soon.  Danny and family."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my sushi rolls.  Staff was friendly and the place is clean and nice inside."}
{"text":"So, I have to be honest and say that I wasn't exactly stoked to eat at this place.  It shares a building with an automotive supply store and I thought for sure that I'd be losing my dinner faster than I ate it.  My husband suggested it because our usual spot had closed down and I was craving sushi.  \"Let's go to Sushi Ave\" was a phrase I was positive that I would regret...

SURPRISE!  This place is great.  The first time we went we had amazing service and the food was good.  The second time we went, the service was amazing and the food was delicious.  I think that my only gripe would be that the rolls are huge and I had to google the appropriate way to eat large pieces; it's all or nothing, btw.  My favorite treat was at the end of the meal when they brought 1/2 an orange drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream.  Ugh, I'm hungry again...

Sushi Ave is our new fav sushi place and I am so happy about that."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  Love the Arizona roll! Brent our server was quick to serve and take care of our sushi needs! Haven't gotten a bad sushi roll and we've tried just about every one on the menu! Thanks Sushi Ave!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with awesome sushi. The place is small, but has some of the best sushi on this side of Gilbert."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and I can not get enough!  Reverse happy hour $5 Sake bombers and rolls. I'm not sure which rolls are on reverse happy hour but today we tried the bbq short rib, jalape√±o roll, and the fever roll which is flambe'd. As usual the presentation was fantastic and tasted phenomenal. My favorite menu item is fresh Wasabi!  Yes you read that right they have fresh Wasabi available for only $3, if you've never had it get it. Once you have fresh you'll notice the huge difference between it and the powder one. For dessert the tempura cheesecake,  again it was phenomenal. I have yet to be disappointed, we enjoy coming here so much that we asked to be on the patron chopstick wall.  You get your own chopsticks every time you come in and don't have to use the large chopsticks, at least in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in the East valley. They have good customer service and are always pretty quick on getting the food out."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi bar. They even have shelves near the entrance with your own personal chopsticks labeled. We came for lunch and we're the only patrons for the first 45 minutes. Everything we got had great flavor. Las Vegas and shrimp tempura rolls, mixed tempura bento box, edamame and miso. All very good."}
{"text":"So hubby and I were having a date night and we just stopped in here on a whim.  What luck! The sushi was very fresh and they had so many on the menu that it was hard to choose! The service was great.  They were all really attentive and very nice!  I can't wait to go back and try all the other sushi that we missed out on."}
{"text":"I came here today with a friend after driving by and seeing the sign for happy hour from 4p-7p on weekdays. The selection was pretty decent, and for 2 people, we ordered about 6 rolls. They were a good size for happy hour, and included a few special rolls. Our favorite was the New York roll and the calamari tempura roll, which we new to us. They're not stingy with spicy mayo or ginger, which is actually really important to me. The ambience inside is nice, and the spot is clean as well. They seem to have a lot of repeat customers because you can save your chopsticks on a shelf for next time. It's very close to home, so I'd definitely stop by again for happy hour. They also give you a little orange as dessert, which is cute!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh sushi and great service! Highly recommend!! My favorites are the Las Vegas and Philly but they have a long list of unique rolls. Good location and you can even save your decorative chopsticks for the future."}
{"text":"What even is the real name of this restaurant? Is it Kanpai as written on the door? Is it Kampai as written on the sign? I actually have no idea and for the sake of this review, it doesn't really matter. Here is what is important about this little restaurant on the west side of town. The two chefs who own and run this restaurant, brought sushi to the valley. No, I am not kidding and its not debatable, AJ and Yuki are the original gangsters of the sushi manifestation that has occurred in Phoenix. 

In order to understand this revelation, we need to go back to 1985(see what I did there). A small sushi restaurant opens in Paradise Valley, right across the street from the mall. It is called Shogun and for many years is the premier sushi restaurant in the valley. Actually, for a while, it was the only sushi restaurant in the valley. Shogun has gone through various restorations and renovations over the years, but originally, it was AJ and Yuki at the small sushi bar inside Shogun with around five or six tables. These sushi geniuses built Shogun into the dynasty that it was and after a few years, moved onto their own venture, named Kampai or Kanpai, depending on which signage you are currently viewing. 

Kampai, found in a very shady strip mall on Bell road, has the best sushi in the valley. There is not a close second. Yuki is the main sushi chef and AJ runs the back end kitchen. Word of warning and the reason for the lack of five stars in this review. If Yuki is not your sushi chef, I cannot vouch for the restaurant at all. I know I know, that sounds brutal, but it's the truth. Yuki is an artist and meticulous. The other chefs just are not in his league and some of the specialties of the house, only taste their best when made from Yuki's hands. 

What makes this place so special? It certainly isn't the decor, which could not be more plain. It is far from the waitress service that is at best, hard to understand. It is the fact that the spicy tuna hand roll is the best I have ever had. The southwest salmon roll, while not only amazing, is only found at this sushi bar, no matter where in the country I have dined on sushi. The southwest salmon roll Is an inside out roll, with salmon and a house cured chili pepper with cucumber and masago on the outside. It is my favorite sushi roll on the planet. As for the sushi, this is the only place in the valley, besides Hiro in North Scottsdale, who serves live scallops. At Hiro, you will pay an arm and a leg, at Kampai, they will be fresher and you will pay fair market price, as set by AJ. The yellowtail and salmon sushi are always cured perfectly, not salty and melt in your mouth. 

There are both entree specials and sushi specials listed on the white boards above and next to the sushi bar. AJ makes the best salmon and yellowtail collars in the business, while serving better versions of the standard sushi bar appetizer fare, IE. Fried oysters, tempura, etc.. 

I will end this review here, but rest assured, if you are looking for the best, most authentic sushi dinner in the valley, Kampai is the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for sushi in the valley. I think I've tried almost every roll here and have not been disappointed. The menu includes pictures, which I always love when picking out some fun options. They set the Volcano roll on fire and it just melts in your mouth. The Las Vegas and New York rolls are also good. The Hawaiian roll in good, the Spider (Crab) roll, I could go on and on. There are so many great choices. The staff here is also super friendly. 

I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place. Just got to get the boyfriend to like sushi. I made him try the really good stuff in NYC and he hasn't been the same ever since.   :p"}
{"text":"Best sushi around. You won't find fresher fish anywhere. Special shout out for the white tuna!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and very pleased with the price, quality and service. I was in a hurry and the staff was very diligent and got us our food fast. The quality is great. Our favorite from happy hour so far is the New York roll. Tip: they offer 10$ gift certificate for showing yelp review!"}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude.

I would give them less than one star, but yelp won't let me click that.

Last night was my third visit to KAMPAI and each time I went, the love that I felt the first time, has now rubbed me the wrong way. I'm a chow hound and always seek the best, and I had found it here... the sushi the way I like it... 

I've bounced around to several sushi bars throughout the city (I'm a once or twice a week -aholic). It's my ol' standby dinner and I was please to have found this place only two blocks from where I live! But for last night I stopped in for some Nigiri Sushi togo and was told 'we are closed'. As I look around the room (which was filled with people) I ask again and was rudely and coldly told 'we are closed'. Ok I'll give them that they do close at 9:00 pm and there was fifteen minutes before that happens and they still have patrons still having their dinners, and a to go order should not be such a imposition on them. With this economy, nobody should be turning away customers, thirty bucks is thirty bucks they should be glad to have customers like me who do return and spend their hard earned money with them. Return loyal customers are what business strive for, or so I thought.

I realize it was a full moon last night, it was beautiful, I know. I actually took time to make a mental note of how lovely it was as my rumbling stomach screamed 'feed me'."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good! You don't wait long to get your food which is great. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"For me, there are two types of sushi restaurants in cities outside of New York and LA, where Japanese restaurants are abundant and go beyond traditional sushi fare.

Type 1 - \"All About The Decor\" - These sushi restaurants are more concerned with the overall aesthetic, where the budget and level of importance is clearly put toward fancy tables, expensive light fixtures, majestic waterfalls, flaming centerpieces, state-of-the-art sound systems and a wait staff waiting to be discovered. Let's not be confused here - the food is really an afterthought. 

Type 2 - \"All About The Food\" - These type of sushi restaurants exist off the main drags, resting subtly in dimly lit corners of strip malls next to dollar stores, or in the case of Kampai, a bowling alley. They are typically \"mom and pop\" family run organizations, poorly decorated, and have a singular focus - really fresh and really good food. 

Kampai is your classic Type 2 joint. I've been many times now, only getting around to writing this review after another visit. It's simple, straight forward sushi. Always fresh, with the standard menu expected by those who want straight forward sushi in a no frills environment. 

There's no music blaring and no crazy list of rolls with ridiculously named concoctions with so many ingredients, you really can't identify any flavors once it hits your tongue. 

Don't get me wrong, there's always a time and place for Type 1 sushi places - parties, happy hours, etc. But if you want good food, fresh fish, a straight forward selection and all of it prepared by actual sushi chefs speaking Japanese, look not further.      

Author's Note: If you watch shows like No Reservations, you'll know that Anthony Bourdain always speaks highly of places like Kampai and would never find himself in Type 1 restaurants."}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered a spicy tuna roll; mostly rice, and cucumber. Quality was not good, sashimi was plain and presentation was terrible. I pulled up at noon, not one car in the lot, I was the only customer...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and specials! Fist place I got sushi flamb√© and it was awesome. Who knew!"}
{"text":"Considering it is in the same complex as a bowling alley I wasn't expecting much when I walked into this place.  Thankfully I was pleasantly pleased with the food. The albacore and salmon nigiri were quite good.  The staff was very nice so I'm a little confused by some of the reviews   My only complaint was the hamachi sashimi was a bit on the small side but the quality was excellent.  All in all I'll be back, especially since it's close to the house."}
{"text":"We ordered the tropical roll and it was so unbelievably good. The sauce was sweet with a mild spice to it and it was just really fantastic. 
The environment is really chill and good vibes all around. 
Definitely check out this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Before this place was taken over by Sushi Ave it was Kumpia's. Kumpai's was awesome!! I had been going there for years. Now that it's Sushi Ave it kinda sucks. The waitress kept ignoring us and when I asked her how the Tataki was made she just said I don't know. Didn't ask a sushi chef nothing, just I don't know. This place definitely isn't my top pick. The food is pretty good but the service sucks."}
{"text":"We went here for Happy Hour. The cucumber salad, edamame, and red bean mochi were great. I liked the miso. Everything else that we got was good. They have a wall for regular guests to keep their chopsticks, which is a great idea that seems uniquely personal. I have not decided yet, but we might become regular enough to get our chopsticks there as well. We spent more than we were planning, but I am not sure if that is because of the price or because we loved it."}
{"text":"i went here and didn't have high expectations  because it was new to me. OMG  everything was so good. i got a bento box and two rolls. happy hour  for lunch was perfect. service was great. i will be back."}
{"text":"Love the new lunch menu. I will have to come back after work to try out the infused saki."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good. Cant be kinda slow when busy. Great happy hour though dine in only."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this sushi joint out for a while due to the reviews on yelp. We have 2 small children so I ordered pickup on a Friday around happy hour. Upon arrival to pick up our food, I noticed a lot of dust on the decor including a pretty disturbing spider web on a few lights. Other than that, the staff was nice and the sushi was good and seemed pretty fresh.  I am torn on whether or not I will return since it was pretty pricey for 4 rolls, and an appetizer."}
{"text":"I've lived in the east valley for 4.5 years,  and I've finally found my sushi spot! Great customer service & the rolls are outstanding! Yum! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to change my rating for this restaurant - the original owner has sold this place. We were excited to see new owners left the same menu, but the execution was a huge disappointment. We actually didn't finish half of the rolls we ordered, though we were still hungry. It is quite upsetting...  I don't know if new owners need more time to master this menu, but I don't see any hope.  If you go, please order one or 2 dishes you used to eat there and see if you still like them, don't waste your money as we did."}
{"text":"This place is close to home, so I was really hoping that it would be better. I had good service, prompt seating, good attitude from waiter. What surprised me was the quality, or lack of quality of the food. I ordered two items, and on one of the rolls, you could see that one of the pieces of fish was just sitting on top. So it was difficult to eat as it kept falling apart. The fish did not seem fresh to me. So even though it was inexpensive, I did not think that there was good value."}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ from Cali a few months ago and when I got hungry for Asian food (Udon specifically) I Googled udon and a location called Kanpai came up..well after reading further it seemed like the wrong website for the location but I decided to give it a shot anyway...Boy am I glad Google made that mistake...I have now gone to at least 1/2 a doz diff locations in the phx/Scottsdale area not to mention all the ones Ive gone to in Cali and this place by FAR takes the cake. The sushi is some of the freshest Ive had and the texture is perfect..the Albacore melts in your mouth as does the cured salmon (which isnt on the menu btw)

The 2nd time I went in I brought my roommate and we sat at the bar, We introduced ourselves to the chef whose name is E.J. we talked back and forth etc etc..well a few weeks later I went in and E.J. Instantly remembered my name and proceeded to ask how my roommate was by name. The next time I went in I talked for about 20min with one of the owners...You can tell they take a lot of pride in the quality of the food and customer service.

Kampai has been there for 18 years was one of only 6 other sushi houses, now there are over 200 different restaurants in Scottsdale/phoenix alone. Dont be fooled by the fact that its located in the back of a small center  next to a bowling alley..its a hidden gem in the rough!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a late Saturday night, 25 min before closing to satisfy a sushi craving. Ordered a few appetizers, a few rolls and sashimi.  At best the food was average, rolls were loose and fell apart when \"dipping\" in the soy.  Service was good and attentive.  Was really surprised to find the tuna kinda chewy.  Pricing ....  Three rolls, 3 appetizers, three pieces of sashimi and a beer was over 70.00 without tip.  Nice touch with the pineapple and whipped cream desert (free).  So, in short, ok place for a sushi craving but just average for price and quality."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Sushi was fresh and large portions. Server was very pleasant. Food seemed to take a long time to come out but it is happy hour and only one chef behind the sushi bar. Would recommend to others! Came with a super cute dessert at the end!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for freshly rolled Sushi and can't make it out of the East Valley, this place might work.  Small dive kind of place next to a Auto Parts Store and Veterinarian Office.

The rolls were a step above store bought and the atmosphere was dark and cold.  Not the social meeting place found at the Sushi Bars I am use to in Ventura CA.

I've visited twice.  The most recent night my fiance and I visited there was a table of about 8 regulars right in the middle of the confined bar who were loud and obnoxious and ruined our dining experience.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"We've tried many of the sushi spots in and around Gilbert and keep coming back to Sushi Ave for their delicious dishes and reasonable prices. We always get the Tootsie Roll. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Food has always been delish 7roles 7in my tummy yum yum yum. Great happy hour great price"}
{"text":"We have been coming to sushi ave for years and it is our favorite go to sushi restaurant. The staff is very nice and the food is to die for! Try the Las Vegas rolls, they are the best! Great prices! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The menu had pictures, which helped us pick out some tasty rolls! The New York roll was our fav!
Friendly staff and a neat ambiance!
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A family favorite!

I always order the chicken katsu I've ever had, though Ra Sushi makes a pretty decent one too. The chicken is incredibly tender and lightly battered with panko bread crumbs, but it is not at all greasy. I wonder if they bake it?

I usually come here with my parents who both order the tempura soba. I always mooch a little because it is so good. The brother is delicious, but I always add some pepper flakes to spice it up. There are tempura batter morsels floating around too, adding a little crunch and dimension to the dish. 

I've ordered the sushi a couple times, but I have to admit I'm not a fan since the portions are indeed skimpy.

No lie, service is inconsistent. Crowd or no crowd, they will be lightening fast one day and super snail-pace slow the next. Seating usually isn't a problem, but I normally go during the week. True, the servers don't speak English very well, but they are super nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great little hidden spot. Rolls are all delicious, had the Maui, Crazy Lobster and sweet potato roll. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Wow, just got take out for the first time last night. Seaweed Salad, California Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. The salad was fresh and delicious with a slight hint of heat. Very, very good. The rolls were both delicious as well. Very fresh and the rice was light and fluffy. The kind of sushi I like to close my eyes and enjoy while eating it. When I went to pick it up, I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside. It's just a tiny storefront next to an auto parts store. My wife and I will be going in soon to try more food."}
{"text":"I went to dinner at Kampai with a friend.  There was a decent crowd as usual.  I have been there a couple of times before a few years back and it was crowded back then.  I think it's because Kampai has the sushi market in that neighborhood.  That area of Bell Road is pretty bleak when it comes to restaurants.  

The service was short and impersonal.  The vegetable tempura we started with, was a tiny portion.  The yellowtail sashimi seemed like a half order cut into smaller pieces to fool me, the customer, that I was getting more pieces of fish.  Skimpy skimpy skimpy!!!

On a positive note the mackerel nigiri was good.

Meh, I\"ve experienced better."}
{"text":"Always impressed when we pick Sushi Ave for dinner. Service is amazing and always on point. Sushi is the best we have had in the years we have been coming. My fianc√© loves the Miso soup and I love trying new rolls. Thank you for being our little sushi restaurant down the road."}
{"text":"Normally don't like sushi because it tastes to fishy. Best sushi I've ever had, plenty of raw fish and I never would have known except they told me it's raw fish. Amazingly delicious"}
{"text":"Had some happy hour rolls. It was good! California rolls surprised me. I usually don't order them, but the gf was willing to share and I thought they were good.

Can't say much for the rest of the menu, but the service was good."}
{"text":"Phily roll is on some next level stuff. Nice dining area and great location near the freeway (60). Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. The sushi was different, the rice is a black/purple color which had no different taste to it. The sushi tasted fresh!! The vibe was good and the service was decent. Definitely eating here more often!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there. Not impresses. I ordered shrimp tempura roll. (Where was the tempura). Also when the waitress sat us down she left a red sharpie and a page, with not instruction or suggestions on what to order? The roll was rather large (that was a plus) but pretty bland. My hubbie ordered shrimp fried rice. It was not a standout. The shrimp looked and tasted like something you buy at the grocery store, or out of a can. My husbands drink was tasteless...how can you mess Sprite up? Anyhow, probably will not go back. There was a lot of weird stuff on the counters, (rancid or fermenting sake? i assume) it just looked gross..."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is just around the corner from my house and is my \"go to\" when I'm having a sudden craving for sushi. I always have a good experience here. The food is good- the service is fast and friendly and it is very affordable. Makes for a great meal in my book!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's never overly crowded, the food is always decent. The price is about average. The employees are always great, and have a good sense of humor. Cant think of anything negative to say. So...I guess I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I walk in take a seat at the sushi bar as I was writing what i wanted on my sushi card card. A couple walked in sat down next to me. The bar tender associate immediately rushed them octopus sashimi. As I continued to wait, I renewed my registration on-line. While this was happening I noticed him making a shrimp tempura roll which just by chance Is what I ordered 15 mins prior. NOPE I WAS WRONG!!! It went to the couple that had just sat down next to me. Sushi was fair not great and I paid $25 for 2 rolls not bad... but for the quality of service NOT GOOD. If I ever go back I will just make sure I go with regulars too get good service."}
{"text":"Service was awesome sushi was awesome!! I would highly recommend this Sushi Ave. I could have had 4 of the Arizona rolls! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a good local and friendly sushi place with decent lunch and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"This was my go-to sushi place when I was still in Gilbert, decided to come back last week with my husband as I missed the place. The place is still awesome as always, the service was great & the food definitely the bomb! I would say this is my favorite sushi place here in the Valley, not to mention the price is also pocket friendly. The Sushis were all made meticulously by the chef! I never skipped baked mussels whenever I visit here, and my hubby's favorite is the lobster roll. You can try all their sushis and you can never go wrong."}
{"text":"Horrible service. As many other reviewers have stated, if you are not a regular expect to wait close to an hour while others around that arrived, after you, are served. Completely rude and unapologetic staff. Charged us for a roll that was never even served, after waiting over an hour.
After coming here frequently a couple years prior, any fond memory is destroyed with my most recent visit in addition to multiple other reviewers."}
{"text":"This is quite the change from the previous sushi place that was there.  It's very clean and the service was excellent!  We ordered the maui roll which had delicious mango sauce, the ultimate Philly roll with fresh salmon, and the baked scallop roll came out hot with a tremendous amount of scallops!  All the rolls were fresh and a great size.  There was just 2 of us and we were very filled at the end.  They had happy hour prices on this particular Saturday night.  The place was quiet which was the only thing that made us feel uneasy walking in as there was only one couple at 7:30 on a Saturday however there was nothing to worry about as the food and service was wonderful.  The bathrooms were clean and the floors were also well maintained.  We spent $53 including tip for 3 specialty rolls, wine and kirin.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was happy the last time I went here, I love the lunch specials with the roll on roll combo that do included the Vegas rolls for under 9 bucks. It's just enough to fill u up. I have been here 4 times and always leave happy, give it a try."}
{"text":"Ownership changed, serve Korean package spicy boodle as Japanese ramen, how dare they.
we have been here over 15 years, not going back any more."}
{"text":"Came in to try happy hour which I saw from driving by with a few prices posted on the A frame. I placed my order then later I was informed the  posted prices would not honored. What a scam. Post lower prices then secretly charge a higher price. Wow!!!  How people say this is the best clearly don't know what quality and fresh mean. The wasabi was powdery and gritty and the ginger is in a small container passed from table to table. We ordered the  New York,  Shrimp Roll, Dynamite Roll and Pot Stickers. The Dynamite was kool when it was set on fire but was very greasy and seamed drenched in mayonnaise.   The pot stickers were store bought,  burnt, and very dry. Huge disappointment.  The New York and Shrimp Roll were ok but lacked flavor and freshness. The exterior of the place is full of faded window paint with a daycare like appearance. We waited quite a bit for our food so to receive such poor quality food was surprising."}
{"text":"I found this place when I lived in the area 4 years ago.  By far the best in the Valley that I have come across.  I have tried other places and keep saying to my better half, not as good as Shawn's!  They recently remodeled the place for those that think shiny and new makes the food better, it doesn't but hey that's your hang up, less waiting in line for me..  The staff like Shawn make the place inviting and make you feel like they care and it feels like an extension of your home.  Living in Mesa I still make the drive just because this is by far the best Sushi in the Valley."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it was recently sold and is no longer the wonderful gem it once was. Very sad.  Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"So I've been eating at sushi ave for a long time and have always loved the food. I became kind of a regular customer and we came during happy hour a lot. This last time we went in the waitress was very very rude. Not even half way through our meal she slammed the check on our table and stormed away. She then came back every 5-10 minutes picked up the check and looked to see if we had paid yet. It was super distracting and felt really hostile. The friend I was with went to the restroom and she swooped in and snatched out half eaten food ignoring me when I told her we were still working on it. Then she harassed me several more times while my friend was in the restroom about the check. As soon as he was back we paid and left. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I just moved from New York, i was on the way home from my sons appointment we came across this small sushi place! I was a little nervous as i didn't research this place before, I'm glad i chose to came in!! service was great as well as the food i will be coming back"}
{"text":"I'll be honest here.   The sushi is really good! Even the non-sushi items are really good.  But the service is really bad!   I'm not saying the servers are rude just slow and very slow.   I've checked out Kampai for over a year , sometimes 2 times a week for lunch service.   The place is usually half full and it still takes the chefs forever to get our orders out!  The last time we went it took 55 mins!!! Hello! It's lunch time, people usually have an hour or less for lunch and need to get back to work!   We stated that we'd need separate checks and were told that was fine but that they would charge 15% tip to each bill.  That's fine but when half of us had to tk our lunch to go versus enjoying it during lunch hour!!!!  WTF!!!!!!    We rushed and paid our bills w/ our 15% tip.   
Needless to say we are going to find another sushi restaurant that knows how to get the lunch crowd served and out on time!!!! 

I only gv Kampai 2 stars bc the food is good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful presentation and charming environment in an unlikely lication! Oh, did I mention on the cheap for happy hour?! (M-f 3-6 & 8-9:30) $5 rolls and $2 miso soup. Yes, please!"}
{"text":"I'm not one who usually writes reviews, but this place definitely deserves it!

Sushi Ave was formerly called Kanpai Sushi. It was my favorite sushi restaurant of all time. When they were bought out by Sushi Ave I was not thrilled, but I forced myself to give them a try. 

I've been there twice in the last week! It's my new favorite! 

Rolls and other foods are placed creatively on white china with an artsy flare to the drizzle of sauces. 

Both times I've been there, there were these two very sweet and well-mannered women: one the head chef, and one the hostess/waitress.

Sushi Ave doesn't generate as much traffic as Kanpai did (at least from what I've seen), but with it's food surpassing the taste/quality of the previous business there, it definitely deserves it in my opinion!

The head chef this time gave me two fried delicious crab puffs on sticks on the house! Yum Yum!! Then satisfied my tastebuds further with another \"On-the-House\" treat of sliced fried pineapple with chocolate sauce & whipped cream!"}
{"text":"Back again today! I came here for the first time last week and wasn't too sure at first glance since it's next to an auto parts store lol. Don't let that fool you! This is honestly the best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I ordered a variety of sushi. The ultimate rainbow roll was so so yummy. I also had salmon sashimi that I loved..... So so good. I was anxious because I'm from Cali and was thinking it wouldn't be as fresh but I couldn't tell the difference."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new sushi spot by my work and glad I did. Fresh squid salad, fresh sashimi and tried the ultimate rainbow roll and it was bomb!  Definitely recommend it and they have happy hour from 11:30 to 2."}
{"text":"Aweful all around. Waited 20 minutes to get seated and then waited another forty for our food - which we received four sushi pieces and the waitress told us they were out of the other sushi we ordered. Yet the table behind us was getting plenty of sushi delivered to them. The price was was to expensive for what we received and the staff didn't even apoligize for not coming over sooner to let us know they were out of what we ordered. 

Good thing the company I went with was great to pass the time"}
{"text":"This place is so good I often come here just too get away from my Girl Friend who I hate so much . 

One day me and her had a huge argument and she said if you don't get me an engagement ring WE ARE DONE ! 

20 min I Instagram her a picture of my self at sushi ave . enjoying some creamy Cali rolls :)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for sushi!  They will keep a set of chopsticks of your choice in a personalized carafe on the wall, so you can use each time you visit! The service is always fast and friendly.  The miso and green tea are hot, fresh, and tasty.  The edamame is perfectly steamed and seasoned, and the sushi is some of the best we've ever.  The rolls are larger in diameter than most, and the selection is huge.  The Crazy Lobster roll is our fave.  Kampai!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is great!! Super easy going and fast service. The sushi is one of the best in gilbert! Our favorite roll was the rolling tiger-highly recommend. The little orange dessert at the end is always a plus too:)"}
{"text":"Service wasn't good, wasn't bad.  

The chefs are really nice and helpful.  

Not the best sushi in town and their portions are really small for the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time about 2 weeks ago, was back 2 more times in 7 days.  Try the Jalapeno popper appetizer  soooo Good!!  So far every roll I have had is great.  Staff is awesome.  Friday nights are a bit busy but they still take care of you and if you have to wait its worth it.   Staff is very nice and friendly.  I am sure most people look what its attached to a Auto parts store what??  LOL Go its so worth it!  enjoy"}
{"text":"We love this place! Started coming here shortly after we moved in the neighborhood and haven't gone to any other sushi place in the local area. Sushi and nigiri are delicious! My favorite part, aside from the sake bombs, are the potstickers! Oh and happy hour prices are great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great happy hour prices and even better sushi. Service is great as well. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is fun!  I really like the chef there.  He is very sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"Honestly when I walked in it seemed dark and I was like oooooh nooooo. Looked at the menu, great prices and looked safe then I got my plate and oh my gosh. GREAT sushi!! Authentic sashimi with the wasabi between fish and rice, fresh, and delicious fish. Definitely a must try when you're in the area."}
{"text":"First timer! Very fun and clean atmosphere! Friendly staff! GREAT SPECIALS AND SUSHI! Very unique personal chopsticks idea!"}
{"text":"This is one of those gems in the rough located in Mesa in the same plaza auto zone it has the best miso soup in town. Skip all the hype (ra) if you re in Mesa and come and enjoy king crab roll for eight bucks during happy hour between 3 and 6"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over a period of 7 years, it use to be my go to Valentine's Day dinner date night, but the few times I've been the service seems just ok.

I went there today and the sushi is great, it's one of my favorite places to eat sushi in Phoenix, although my favorite is Sushi Cho in Tucson.  Anyways, today it took a couple minutes to get a menu and I actually had to ask the Sushi chef for one and it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to even ask what I wanted to drink.

It took another 10 minutes to get my plum wine and water.  One of my orders came out probably about 5 - 10 minutes after I got my drink, but I had two more kinds of sushi coming.  By the time my last order came out it was a cumulative total of about 35 minutes.

I didn't dare ask for another plum wine in fear of being there for another 20 minutes.

I'm kind of disappointed that they either have staffing problems or just like taking their time, because their food is quite good.  Although, over the last few years I have noticed changes in portions.

I ordered my usual albacore tataki and it's just not the same."}
{"text":"First time trying sushi!

I got the California and the crunch California. I tried the Ohilly and the New York and they were amazing.

Service and atmosphere was nice!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Very reasonable happy hour prices till 7pm.  I loved the crab jalapeno poppers and the energizer roll was delicious.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi ave, great food, great prices and friendly staff. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to many sushi places in the valley, and this is by far my favorite. The sushi was amazing, not so dense that you practically choke on it, so light and full of flavor. And the teriyaki chicken was OUTSTANDING. Not just your typical \"brown teriyaki sauce and rice\", this was made with homemade sauce, fresh veggies and really tender chicken. PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome sushi and quick service. Brent was amazing, witty and I too of his game. Would come back anytime!"}
{"text":"This is an incredible cute place for sushi. I have never been and tried it for the first time and now I'm hooked. Staff polite, and failry fast service!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night for the first time. Very pleased with what we had. Seemed pretty authentic to me. Will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"First time here. Friendly staff and great sushi. Also cool modern look. Will surely return."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for a while but the food was excellent. The Tempura was delicious! The sushi rolls had awesome flavors and tasted very fresh. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"My review is for the regular menu, not the sushi. I go along with my sushi loving boyfriend to sushi bars frequently so I've had my share of \"other menu items\" at these places. I ordered the teriyaki chicken, it was dry and the sauce was too strong with soy sauce flavor. I ordered green tea and when it came it was separating in the glass and had stuff floating in it. That was an absolute no go. The decor is a dive, which I am normally willing to overlook if the food is good. My boyfriend does love the sushi here and has been going here a long time. So if you're solely in it for sushi, go for it. Otherwise go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for Family or just to have some lunch. we usually go during lunch happy hour on Friday. I must say it is nice a quiet and love to be able to chat while eating. They do play music on a radio. Sometimes its loud but not too bad. Now Getting to the food. Happy hour. is amazing. the Sushi is filling. just the right amount of food for the cost. The servers is nice and we don't have to wait too long for anything to come to us. if you are looking for an all you can eat, they do not accommodate but we are satisfied with just the happy hour. Great Food hands down."}
{"text":"My son and I popped in for a quick bite to eat this week and what a surprise. Friendly service and the food... so fresh and yummy. I'm excited that my office is just up the road on Higley and Baseline cause I will be stopping in again very soon for lunch. My new favorite place for sushi.   on the money for this one. You'll  it just like we did. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price! I will be a regular as long as they keep the lunch special. I usually place an order for pick up at least twice a week. Try the Philly roll! They put a generous amount of fish on their rolls. I wonder why its so dead every time i go in???"}
{"text":"I could live off of sushi and being from Southern California I have had some amazing experiences at different locations and I have had my fair share of experiences of sushi restaurants in scottsdale too. I was a bit weary at first but REALLY impressed after my meal. The Las Vegas Roll is great and the Scallop
 roll was delici!"}
{"text":"Love the decor- dark walls with pops of red. Calm environment, great for chatting. The sushi was delicious and very reasonably priced during happy hour. Good service!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorite was the New York and my Fianc√©'s favorite was the Las Vegas! The service was fast and the food was hot and delicious. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Sushi was great!  Fish tasted fresh and it was prepared well. Service was nice as well. A good go-to neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it is so close to where I live. I certainly hope the level of service is not consistently like it was when I was there. Staff did not even apologize for the wait which leads me to believe this is the norm. Took over an hour to bring out 3 rolls of sushi and they didn't even honor the advertised happy hour special. More servers during peak times might help with creating a better experience, but the silver lining is that the sushi is only mediocre."}
{"text":"It kills me to leave a 1-star review for a restaurant that I once called \"the best sushi in Arizona\". My father I have been coming to Kampai for over 15 years (ever since I was a little girl) and would usually eat here about every other month. The sushi was wonderful and fresh and the staff was friendly and always remembered us. The last time I ate at Kampai (before the change) was in April and the quality was as good as ever, we had our usual blonde spikey haired waitress who was always so sweet and helpful and we had a great time. We had no idea that it would be the last time we would enjoy our meals here
Then the owners changed.
I deeply miss the old owners, and feel they would be deeply disappointed at the state of the restaurant now. We just got back from dinner at Kampai and it was utterly horrible. The quality of the fish was astonishing sub-par and my beloved Tempura Udon was very watery and bland. The octopus, soy beans, tempura shrimp and vegetables, salmon, and yellowtail were all not very good and the Salmon Roe was shriveled and very small, and way too salty.You could tell that they were refilling the bottles of soy sauce was very cheap version that was (again!) salty and terrible. I don't know how a wonderful, traditional Japanese restaurant could sink so low, so fast. The menu was completely different (though they did have some old favorites) featuring orange chicken, egg rolls, and a variety of weird desserts that have never been on the menu before. They also seemed to be \"out\" of many things we tried to order: agedashi tofu, uni, white meat chicken etc. The bathrooms were filthy, and very weird country/soft rock was playing too loudly in the background. Ugh.
I'm very saddened to say we will never be returning to Kampai again. They say change is good but in this case it definitely wasn't. We'll miss you Kampai."}
{"text":"I love goin here for their lunch bento.
Chicken teriyaki with mixed tempura is my choice 
Every time I go there. 
It's so so good and their service is 5 stars as well as their food."}
{"text":"We had the sashimi combo. Excellent! Good crowd. Mellow atmosphere. Nice neighborhood restaurant. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I was driving home on Higley from a dentist appointment and this \"Happy Hour\" sign caught my eye.  I'm always up for a good Happy Hour for food so I decided to check it out.  The food was good and the people were friendly.  I got the Jalape√±o Poppers (2 pcs), Spicy Tuna Roll (8 pcs), and Philly Roll (8 pcs) from the Happy Hour (4pm-7pm) menu and it came out to $14.  This place was worth the impromptu visit, and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good sushi joint close by that is good and not to pricey. I always saw this place but never tried it but saw reviews for its and decided to give it a try. It was great, the best I have had so far. They had a great Hawaiian roll of some sort that was awesome. We basically had a few of their various rolls since we are just beginners at Sushi. We are not hardcore like some but this place did its job and hit the spot. I like the quaint atmosphere and really nice wait staff. It was really dark inside which took a bit for my eyes to get use to :) But all around I loved it."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The restaurant was very casual and seemed very clean.  They have a wall of chop sticks when you first enter.  I think you can buy a pair and just leave them there so you can use the same pair each visit; pretty cool idea.  The customer service seemed a little off though, not that friendly.  For some reason the waitress decided to walk away after taking my boyfriend's order without taking mine.  I guess she thought I wasn't hungry. The food itself was alright.  The sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't fantastic.  If you want sushi and you're in the area it will do the job, but I wouldn't go out of the way.  I also had the orange chicken which had good texture, but is about as salty as a potato chip, also there wasn't much meat."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good service and the sushi is amazing. Try the ASU roll if your looking for spice and the Hawaiian for sweet. Ask for Colin, he's the best waiter at Sushi Ave."}
{"text":"First look and you think augh how good can this place be after all it's next to an auto parts store.  Well let me tell you it is bar far the best Sushi.  I visit RA a lot because my friend live close by, but then I found Sushi Ave. on a dining reward program and I don't go anywhere else!!  They are attentive, the sushi is FRESH, the plum sangria is amazing, the price is very good compared to how much food you get.  Well worth the visit!!!  If you go often you also get your own set of chop stix which they clean and store up front for the next time you come.  LOVE LOVE LOVE Sushi Ave.!!!!  The only negative thing I might say is the chairs make a horrible noise scraping on the floor every time you move."}
{"text":"Our favorite local restaurant! Great, quick service and the best Japanese food around. Everything always tastes fresh. We'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"The sushi chef is amazing! I don't understand why some people don't like this place I guess it depends on what they are comparing it to. The food is excellent and again the sushi chef is the best! I'd give them 10 stars if I could. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit AZ Sushi Ave is a stop on my list. The prices are pretty comparable but the quality is really great! They also have great happy hour drals!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ave. is legit! I come here all the time. Delicious authentic sushi at a great price. The sashimi combos are always a great deal."}
{"text":"Sushi ave is my new favorite sushi place!!! They have a love love roll that is awesome!!!!! Don't let the mustard sauce description fool you, it is sweet and ads just the right amount of heat to the roll. The server and sushi chef we had tonight were attentive and able to give on the spot suggestions for sake and some of their more unique sushi rolls. We were given a free poke salad, sake, edamame, and a yummy pineapple desert! The salmon sashimi we had was amazing, along with the two love love rolls we had, the rainbow role, and the cucumber I was in sushi heaven! I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great new place we found. Great happy hour prices. My favorite is the 'no leftover' roll. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for happy hour. The sushi was good and definitely worth it. Our server was very friendly and attentive and we really appreciated our server's recommendation of the Love Love Roll. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Their speciality rolls are yummy, service is friendly, and they have created an atmosphere of \"community.\"  Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Great rolls with great price!!!
Shrimp tempura is my favorite! The people were professional and I did not have to wait too long for my food. I go there every time I'm in the area, would recommend."}
{"text":"THE END OF AN ERA
What once was the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix is now under new management, and it definitely shows.
They have tried to bring in new rolls similar to those at every other sushi place. They have changed the ingredients in many of their rolls, including the spicy tuna roll and the shrimp tempura rolls, which were the ones that kept us coming back. Kampai was special because it wasn't like every other Scottsdale sushi place, it had the freshest ingredients and the most authentic rolls. Not anymore.

The quality of the ingredients is now very poor compared to what it used to be. The fish is sliced way too thin. The rolls were not as fresh or as tasty even in the slightest. Their spicy tuna roll, which used to have fresh tuna and cucumbers and sprouts, is now made with a mixture of chopped tuna and spices with \"Krab\" mix. 

They changed their entire staff, which will come back to bite them sooner or later. The new sushi chef was rude, did not want to engage in conversation, and plainly did not acknowledge us. Our order was taken much later than we were ready to give it, and we had to ask for waters. Then, another chef came into the sushi bar area from the back wearing a plain tshirt, not a uniform, and without washing his hands he began to make our food. There were several questionable instances when cleanliness did not seem to be a concern of the sushi chefs. 

Sanitation is major at a sushi restaurant, and so is the food. So is the service. So is the music (which they changed from nice traditional music to soft rock?!). Since all of these things have changed, my family who has been long-time customers of Kampai for the last 15 years will sadly not be returning. Kampai, you just lost some previously dedicated customers. 

At least we went here in May for my birthday before they changed, I wish we knew it would be the last time that we could enjoy our favorites. I don't see how they will stay open for much longer."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's seriously the best sushi I've had at the best prices. There is a huge variety to choose from.  My favorites are the Unagi, Deep Fried, Las Vegas, and Spicy Tuna rolls.  I've never eaten from their regular menu though.  The service is good, the chefs are fast, fun, friendly, and have skill.  It's a family owned place and I believe the head chef(s) are from Japan.  It's got a quaint atmosphere and not trendy in the least.  The prices are EXTREMELY reasonable.  The Miso soup here is perfect as well.  I have eaten there on Friday and Saturday nights which can get busy.  Everytime I go there I see regulars. You can also get the sushi to go which is nice.   

Bottom line, this place is TEN times better than RA as far as quality of sushi goes.  It's not as expensive as Ah So either.  Perfect atmosphere as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Phenomenal happy hour prices and selection,  i had a delicious jalapeno roll.  California was good, but very little avocado, (and only $3).  Service a bit slow,  but friendly.   4 stars, mainly for price.   Offer a $10 discount on next visit when showung them that you reviewed them,  but I didn't take advantage."}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE best sushi this side of the US 60. Happy hour is from 4-7PM with great prices on some hella good sushi! Thanks sushi avenue!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. Servers are polite and cheerful. Almost overwhelming selection. We love the sushi rolls, and my kids enjoyed the bento boxes. Delicious chocolate drizzled orange to end the meal. Will return whenever the sushi craving hits!"}
{"text":"Nice local place with some interesting rolls you won't get at other places! My favorite was the tiger roll. We also liked their gyoza and tofu appetizer. Great service.. We plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Always fresh. Love the spicy squid and fresh Toro, One of the best local sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I had the spicy tuna fried garlic roll and it might have been the best roll I've ever had. Fast service. Clean place. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy sushi and other Japanese fare, look no further.  We went on a Thursday evening and sat at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef greeted us as we walked in the door.  The place was rather dark, but looked very clean.  There was only one other couple in the restaurant.  

The sushi bar faced 2 flat screen tvs that were playing sports (x games).  The decor was simple, black.  The bar stools are small, IKEA looking seats.  Was worried about staying on mine.  HA.

There is a huge variety of specialty sushi; the Hawaiian was suggested by the waiter, and we ended up eating 2 of them!  We also got the usual CA roll, Philly roll, and salmon.  We also got piping hot salt covered edamame, which was good.  The sushi was okay, the seaweed they use is more chewy than I have ever experienced, didn't have the heart to tell the sushi chef.  The specialty sushi is priced around $12 per roll, the typical sushi (like CA roll) is around $4 per roll.

There were only 6 other people who ate @ the restaurant that night, and although the sushi chef said it picked up @ 6:30 or 7, it never did.  We would return to try some of the other Japanese items on the menu, but not the sushi."}
{"text":"I think what I like most of all about Sushi Ave is Harry and Nana. They have made my experiences so pleasant. Every time Travis and I go to Sushi Ave Nana makes us something special (from her secret menu) and it's ALWAYS delicious! She is working on a secret menu to offer on their Yelp page and I am so excited for it, because everything she gives us is AMAZING!

Their sushi rolls are full of flavor, never have they been soggy, the Vegas roll is SOO good!!! Warm, with a light crisp texture and eel sauce...mmmMmm!

Come, try it out, it really is as good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"Groan, moan, sigh. We came here on a Sat night and the restaurant was okay busy but extremely under staffed. 
We were seated asked by one waitress what we wanted to order. When we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she promptly disappeared. I mean, literally. We never say her back in the dining room again. 
There was one sushi chef and one waitress for the whole place. Tick tock, tick tock. It took over 30 mins to order and prob even longer to get our food. 
The worst part was the waitress was pretty rude to us until she saw me check in on Yelp. Instantaneously she was much friendlier and nicer to us.  Pretty suspect!
We still left her a decent tip cause anyone can have an off night . . . But not sure we will be back- the food?  Who can remember- we dozed off while waiting for it!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little sushi spot! I had no idea it was even on the corner of Higley and Guadalupe, but it is definitely a hidden gem. Their happy hour runs from 3-7pm on weeknights, which is perfect for stopping by right after work! The rolls were all delicious, happy hour pricing was about mid-range (but a great deal for the quality of food) and the size of the rolls was not at all stingy. Their rainbow roll was one of the best I've had in the Valley. Also, when the server brings you your check they also give you a little dessert consisting of orange slices with some whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. Definitely worth a try - I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love everything I have had here !! I am so going to try dessert next time - it's trying to pick just one .. I brought my daughter tonight she loved it- I normally come with my Best friend !! It's our new favorite !!"}
{"text":"Disgusted with the \"service\" my family and I received tonight. We got there an hour ago and after waiting an hour for food we still didn't get any. I packed up my kids and started walking out and then they finally apologize. My husband is still inside waiting for our food. We got there close to the end of happy hour, so yes we knew it would be busy, but we didn't think we would be forgotten. There were several parties who came after us that had their meals before we even had our drinks. The kids meal came out in 3 minutes. Appetizers....never showed up. Food.....never showed up. I'm so disappointed right now as I really like this place but doubt I'll ever come again after this. Not at all how I wanted to spend my Friday evening. Shame on you Sushi Ave."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended Sushi Ave to me so I came for lunch. The sushi is really good and the prices are great. The jalepeno roll is the best! I'll definitely be back for lunch often."}
{"text":"Cute place very clean. The waitress is a doll and very sweet. Everything we tried was delicious."}
{"text":"When my brother's friend found out where I lived recently, his first reaction was \"oh, so you've been to Kampai then?\"  My blank look horrified him, and he quickly explained that apparently I have a hidden gem sushi place in my North Phoenix neighborhood -- a \"gem\" that he referred to as one of the best in the city!  This was a pleasant surprise to me (I guess I should have paid more attention when I drove by that bowling lane strip mall...).

Two words:  GREAT SUSHI!  Seriously up-to-par with my most recent bar-setter, Hana sushi -- except less expensive and much larger portions.  In fact, I had the opposite experience of many of the reviewers here:  our portions were shockingly large, from oversized/fat rolls to a sashimi order that was almost double what I would have expected.  The albacore tataki and Kampai roll were our favorites, but everything we had was fresh and delicious.

The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, depending on your mood.  I was a little caught off-guard by the harsh...errr...bright lighting as well as the lack of noise/energy there on a Friday night.  Of course this can be refreshing compared to the \"scene\" at a Stingray or Ra.  Our service at our table was fantastic, very attentive and friendly.  

I will definitely be making Kampai a staple in the portfolio, and given that I favored the food over the dining experience, I will certainly consider takeout as well in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Salmon collar is a must.  Suggest trying spicy sizzling pork.  Jalapeno poppers were excellent as well.  Never disappointed.  Best sushi in the valley."}
{"text":"Food was great! Made it 5 min before happy hour ended and the waitress got everything in just in time. The service was outstanding. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and wanted some good sushi. My brother who resides out here brought us to Sushi Ave. I'm so glad we ubered here because the happy hour is amazing!! They have a lunch and dinner happy hour so cheers! Anyways bottom line is Great service, great food, awesome happy hours! Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars. Ordered over the phone after viewing website and menu. Strike one when I order ahead of time and go to a restaurant to pick up my order and it's not done. Strike 2 when I checked my bag to leave and all of my food was not in the bag. Strike 3, the plates we ordered were disgusting. 

The spicy tuna we ordered wasn't spicy, and really fishy tasting. Our squid salad also left very much to be desired and was extremely rubbery. I've had better squid salad for a fraction of the price at Teharu (the conveyor belt sushi place). It makes me wonder if they're just cooking up dead animals from the veterinarian's office next door.... The food was seriously that disgusting, I wouldn't be surprised."}
{"text":"Good local place great food! Nice employees. Large party sushi so backed up only 1 sushi chef. Our first time here cost for three people 74 with tip. Next time will come for Happy  hour 5.00 rolls 5.00 sake bombers"}
{"text":"Wow great place to eat just came home from dinner.  I've been meaning to try this place for a couple of months now, and finally decided to check it with a friend.  Good atmosphere not noisy at all and a great place for good sushi and a good talk.  Fish quality was good and service was excellent.  Will definitely be back to try the different rolls.

Had the New York, Volcano, and Red Spider alll very tasty"}
{"text":"This is the best kept sushi secret in the area! We have been a few other places for sushi but we keep coming back to Sushi Ave. They have so many options and SO many delicious rolls! Our service is always great and they have a fabulous happy hour."}
{"text":"Came with my husband who's not the biggest fan of sushi, but I love it! And this place did not disappoint!! Everyone was friendly and nice, very welcoming and helpful and also informative. Food was excellent!!! Will definitely be coming here on a regular basis from now on!!! Special thanks to Colin for great service!"}
{"text":"Hit up Sushi Ave on a Sat night, I lucked out and got the parking spot right in front! As soon as we walked in my wife and I were greeted by a server. She sat us at a table right int he middle along the wall. The place wasn't packed, but not empty, just the right amount of folks to instill confidence that this was a good place. By the time we were done with our meal, 3-4 parties had been seated. They had a TV on which had college football on, yes!

The menu is pretty big, filled with many specialty rolls they have created. I tried the ASU Roll, Crunchy California, Shrimp Tempura, and Super Philly. All were good. The ASU Roll is similar to the Arizona Roll at House Modern Sushi, spicy sauce, and a jalepeno on top. It wasn't that hot flavor wise (maybe my headcold had something to do w/ that). The Super Philly is close to what they serve at Orient on Elliot, I added my own sriracha to it to up the flavor. My wife is pregnant so she had most of the cali and shrimp tempura roll, she had been craving some sushi and left me to eat the rolls w/ uncooked fish.

Got edamame, came out nice and hot, not one cold bean and just the right amount of salt on top. I had some hot tea, it was okay, not sure what the blend was but something green. 

Service was attentive, got refills without having to flag someone down, and the food was brought out quickly after ordering since we beat the rush. With our bill, we also got an orange cut in half w/ some whipped cream and chocolate syrup, with two toothpicks to cleanse the palate. Enjoy when places do that, not all of them do. The owners (what I believe to be the owners) said \"thank you!\" loudly when we got up after eating. Glad to see we're noticed and they seemed to care about our business.

Loved the music here - they were playing some cover songs of modern pop tracks which was fun.

Will definitely be back since its pretty close to home."}
{"text":"Better than ever!  Fresh, delicious fish.  A variety of unique rolls.  I enjoyed the Maui roll and Super White Tuna sashimi.  Friendly staff.  Good prices.  High standards.  I'll be back... Often."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic sushi come here at least once a month such fantastic service"}
{"text":"First time here! Great vibe and the food was delicious. We devoured 5 rolls, two orders of potstickers and coconut shrimp.  Great prices and friendly service in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Pro - FRESH, sushi is delicous, service is good.  You get to store your own chopsticks-  catchy.  Hopefully nobody licks them while your away. 

Con - Nit picky but the bottom of the chairs need those soft thingys.  Everytime some sits - SCREEEEECH.   

The weird stuff in the jars are not all that.  Wont do that again. 

The lobster roll was awesome."}
{"text":"Another Sushi place that is owned by Koreans lol. The staff including the waitress and sushi chef were nice and service was good. But it was quite empty that day (just two tables including ours) so maybe that was the reason. Anyways, ordered salmon and scallop nigiri which were both good. The fish tasted fresh. No complaints here!

Then ordered some rolls: spicy roll (forgot name), rainbow, caterpillar, and alaskan. Again, the fish were fresh, but I gotta say, I wasn't a big fan of the alakan roll. Originally, I thought the lemon on it would add a nice zing, but It kinda overpowered everything. On the other hand, I would recommend the rainbow and caterpillar roll if you like a bunch of sushi and eel. (eel cause=bomb). 

Now on to my rant of this place. I guess it's not meant to be a negative but just a warning to those with bigger or hungry stomachs. This place has the TINIEST rolls ever. I swear the pictures of rolls on the menu are the actual size of the rolls. You eat one and you don't even feel it sitting in your stomach. I actually asked the waitress which of the rolls were the biggest. lol 

So yea, there you have it. It's a nice sushi place with fresh fish and good staff, but if you want value and bigger portions, I would look else where."}
{"text":"Big fan of Katsu Chicken and japanese food so I thought I'd give this place a try. The Katsu Chicken was awesome! It was a tad bit well done but was still really good. The sushi had a really good quality to it and they were fast so serve us. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!! The inside design is really nice and comfy, won't fit a lot of people though. I'm not a BIG sushi fan, but they have everything you need and more which I like. I had their tempura udon and it's really good, the soup base is delicious (not too salty). My friends ordered the sushi rolls and they were so good as well. I really like their California rolls. Our server was really nice too. Definetely will come again!! Might be our new sushi place!"}
{"text":"Amazing definitely would recommend this place!!! Worth every penny. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was great and fresh."}
{"text":"This really could have been a 5star and I will go back to give it a chance. Great food. I went at 5:20 on a Friday Eve which was perfect timing. Within 20 minutes, place was full. They had a happy hour menu with great priced rolls. I also got a special roll. The happy hour rolls were fabulous! The special roll was good. I got teriyaki chicken for the kids. This dish was good. They missed out on 5 stars because of wait times. They are hiring. Also, I had requested two refills for sodas but was brought one. \"The other still has soda\" which was odd. Great food, great price. Will try a different special next time."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi in the East Valley the sushi is very fresh and tasty. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave has the best happy hour for a sushi restaurant, I'm sold on that. The happy hour menu is delicious and the large sake is only $3. We love their ASU roll, double spicy, jalapeno roll, etc. The list goes on and on. 

The only reason I took off one star is because we never knew who our server was. We would get our food an that was the only time we were able to quick restaurant a drink or another roll and it was never the same person. It was so chaotic and they were all just running around.  Once they figure out a routine, it will be as god as it gets for a sushi restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very kind! However, the food was mediocre at best. I would equate it with the sushi you can buy pre-made at a grocery store."}
{"text":"The best sushi happy hour in town! The New York roll is delicious and so unique! Good service and great food, just can't be beat! You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great hot saki to warm the inners. Great service and the happy hour has rocking prices."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a very long happy hour and a good happy hour menu. Took a star off only because some rolls are too big for one bite, maybe that's a personal problem  Overall, it's a great place, clean, fast service with a smile, and great sushi."}
{"text":"The rolls are really good. Have been to many sushi places where the rolls were already prepared and frozen, but at this place the chef was preparing the rolls to order. Visited this place during the happy hour and the pricing is really good! The ambience is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave has been me and my girlfriends spot since we were in 9th grade. We have taken our chances other places and nothing hits the spot quite like Sushi Ave. the service is almost as good as the sushi and the crab jalape√±o poppers were the most amazing things I've ever had in my life. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Great food , TERRIBLE wait! Its been almost an hour and we still haven't got our appetizers! We thought about leaving but we already waisted an hour! So if you have hours to spare, this is the place to come waist it! #hangry"}
{"text":"We come here every weekend. Great sushi, great prices, and friendly staff. We always recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Pricing is very good! Extremely low prices for high quality sushi. Food is excellent but service is a bit slow. If you are in a hurry for a work lunch could get stressful."}
{"text":"The rolls are good, but they have a hard time getting your order right when you call in for carry out. I always order the same thing and they continually get it wrong to the point that I have started to just get different items because I know they will give me a \"spicy salmon roll when I asked for a spicy salmon bowl\" 
Over all they are good just don't call in"}
{"text":"First time here and I was not disappointed!! We got the White Christmas, the Maui Roll and the Monkey Brain. It was so good!! It also came with a complimentary fruit dessert."}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.3 stars I would. Excellent, clean, serving sizes are average and prices for sushi are maybe slightly below average. Which is great. Happy hour just isn't during the week. Make it there on Saturday between 11am and 2pm and get special prices. Although I do believe they make up for it with smaller than average sushi servings. Still, one can't deny it is one of the better places in the Phoenix areas."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. I get great service every time and it comes a good price. Food never late and the restaurant is never busy. A good quiet restaurant."}
{"text":"My family loves this place it is our favorite sushi restaurant. The food is great, The Price is Right, and the service is great but very nice employees."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here...especially at their Happy Hour prices. The other food is OK, not wonderful. The hot tea had a funny taste...not what we are used to. However, this is our go-to for sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered a bento pox and a jalape√±o pot sticker the last time I was here and here ordering it now. It was great.  I've eaten this quality of food only in San Francisco. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"There's nothing you can do to not give this sushi stop 5 star!  The aesthetics, service and food are all traditional, spot on and wonderful.  I have gone here several times with friends on many occasions and its always been a hit.  The sushi is amazing and honest.  It's a good fix when your away from the ocean and it passes up some of the places I've eaten on the ocean coast.  Anything you get here whether it's the sushi or the grill will impress.  The deserts are also pretty rad as well and I love it that they keep everything traditional and rooted.  If you want to try something amazing and semi exotic get the Kama - Yellowfin Collar.  FREAKING STELLAR!!  Rice and grilled fish brings me right back down to the roots."}
{"text":"I would look at your bank statement a few weeks after going here. I went here about a month ago they charged me that day and just checked my bank statement and they charged another 20 dollars to my card 2 days ago and that wasn't anywhere near my tab or tip."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with the family.  We were very pleased with how good the food was.  Sushi was fresh the rolls were nice sized and the Salmon was very tasty.  Their sashimi portions could be a bit more generous but outside of that very nice.
The hot food and appetizers were  great.  If you want an amazing appetizer go for the Spicy Garlic Edamame, or their cucumber salad.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been twice now and this place ranks with Ra as being top nasty sushi place. People that rate a place on rolls should not comment on \"freshness\". Rolls are for people that eat sushi to be cool. Eat the sashimi and then rate. Anyways, had the large sashimi plate. Fish was warm, not on ice and the albacore about made be puke. It's easy to dress up bad fish with rice and sauces but not sashimi. Fish was glossy and opaque......... Never again!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, always delicious and on or above par with sushi places of similar price and style.  Service always seems to be just a bit of a struggle."}
{"text":"Warm sushi, unorganized service, warm beer...... need I say more. The rolls were a quarter size if smaller & warm when they shouldn't have been. The price you pay for the smallest of rolls was RIDICULOUS!!!! The inside of the egg rolls were still frozen..... we all know that means they cooked them hot & fast, not slow & warm. $70 for 2 people to eat w/1 of us having 1 beer is insane!!!!! Not sure how this place has stayed open unless people enjoy blowing money of poor poor sushi. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Great Vegas rolls and miso soup is delicious. They have great lunch specials from 11-2. My husband tried their orange chicken \"box meal\" and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Simply... WOW!!  The menu has expanded, and the food is even better under the new owners!  Presentation, portion size, and freshness are all 5 stars.  And the service?  A++!!!  I am a big foodie (cooked with Barbara Fenzl on Channel 8), so don't give high praise unless it REALLY is that good.  My favorite sushi/sashimi in the valley (and not paying snobby Scottsdale prices)."}
{"text":"We ordered sushi from Sushi Ave to take home so I can not rate the service for eating at the restaurant. We got five rolls: Caterpillar, Tiger, Ultimate Rainbow and some with avocado. I wasn't crazy about the latter (it was good, just not my taste) but the others were really great. The only thing I didn't like was that one roll (I think it was one with eel) had a noticeable butane gas taste, maybe they used a butane gas torch to char the fish. The rest of the roll was so delicious that I still ate it though. I take one star off for this and the fact that it is a bit too pricey in my opinion, to be really satisfied you need at least two rolls and that costs you a good $20-30 here. I still recommend this place and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: my last visit was at least 9 months ago; I have no idea what it's like now with a new owner, but prospects don't look good: Love this place! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is fantastic! The wait staff is very nice & accommodating. Everything tastes so fresh and comes out quickly! It's excellent & one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is fantastic! This place is by far my favorite Sushi place in the valley. The crazy lobster roll, tropical roll, and ASU roll are especially delicious. I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't like. The service is always great and the staff is very friendly. The happy hour is also very fun and affordable!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and attentive service.  The Red Dragon roll was very good and the Shishito peppers were awesome.  They also have a decent Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Kampai is in a really crappy strip mall, and the establishments around it look really shady. However, I have nothing but great things to say about Kampai. My daughter and I usually go on friday evening around 6, and the service is great. The staff is very friendly and the fried oysters are delicious! They have some very unique rolls if you look over the menu, of on the chalk board above the bar. I enjoy taking my 9 year old here for dinner, it is not an over crowded hipster place which is a releif. It has a quiet atmosphere where you can sit and enjoy your meal and the company with you."}
{"text":"We finally found a sushi place to call \"ours\". My favorite is the calamari roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place. We were seated pretty quickly and the sushi was good. What made this experience bad was the lack of customer service. My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken without vegetables and Brent, our waiter, brought out the teriyaki chicken not made to our order, so we kindly asked for it to be remade without the vegetables. What was disappointing is that we waited 22 minutes to get to remake of the teriyaki chicken and after eating our food, we waited another 19 minutes to get our check. On top of this, our waiter Brent didn't check in on us once we asked him to have our teriyaki chicken made (duration of 41 minutes). It felt like he was intentionally ignoring us because he never came back to our table and asked us how our food was, etc. 

In conclusion, I would recommend this place for the sushi, but as far as the customer service goes, the employees need some training."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi! I have seen this restaurant before but never had time to stop in, today I did just that. It was excellent, not only the service but the prices and the food were excellent. If I could give it 10 stars I would. High five Sushi Ave!!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my GO-TO sushi place. There is a nice atmosphere, and it has a really nice mix of different Asian foods (I've seen people complaining, but they have definitely always played Korean music) and I think this greatly benefits them. There is something for everyone. Their lollipop roll is my favorite fried roll, and we always have to order the salmon nigiri. It seems pricey, but it's all worth it. If you're not a fan of sushi, their noodles are delicious. I have also ordered the chicken katsu (a personal favorite). The bento boxes are a good place to start if you are completely overwhelmed (everything you can order for these I have learned are all very delicious, come with a protein, sticky rice, Asian salad, and miso soup). I would definitely recommend the yakisoba. 

All in all, I think they're a generally good restaurant. Maybe not if you're looking for strictly Japanese, but you will receive quality (so much better than Ra and many other local places) and its family owned. A nice place to relax and talk. I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE sushi ave! Not only is the service and staff fantastic,but the food is AMAZING!!!! I come here as often as i possibly can. I'm crazy about the hawaiian chicken and the las vegas rolls. The happy hour menu couldn't be any more perfect,either. It has everything on their that I normally get at a great price!!!! While others are blinded by the trendiness of other \"sushi\" resturaunts, such as RA sushi, i'm enjoying QUALITY food by chefs who put their heart into every plate they make. I would reccomend this place to anyone and EVERYONE! SUSHI AVE YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"The rolls and cocktails were super good. My boyfriend and I love sushi and it was great to know that there's a place nearby us that serves good quality Japanese food. The staff accommodated us even though we arrived at almost 9pm which is the restaurant's closing time. Definitely coming back to try more rolls!"}
{"text":"Saw positive reviews for Sushi Avenue and decided to stop by and try Sushi Avenue.  The employees there are very nice and care about their customers.  The Food is the best!!  I had Octapus and fresh water eel sushi as well as their Teryaki Chicken plate.  I would deffinetly suggest going."}
{"text":"Good Sushi, the Dynamite roll was really fishy tasting, and the Vegas roll was much better.  Small restaurant, does not have the Japanese ambiance.  Service was great for the first sushi roll we ordered and super slow on the second one, and we ordered the rolls at the same time.
Happy hour is for a full 24 hours a day which was great.  We spent $23.00 on two rolls, Kirin and Sake."}
{"text":"I continue to enjoy coming back to this little place in our neighborhood. This isn't the best Japanese restaurant in the world, but the food is good and plentiful, and the service has always been very good each time. I haven't came here in Happy Hour. However I guess it'll be crowded that time with a good price Happy Hour Menu. 

The place was quite, small, and a bit dark/dim. ... but there are fine display like the personalized chop sticks, sake display and stone corner. ...

I did had Nabe Yaki Udon, Dragon Roll and Spicy Tuna. It's so good to me. I'm really addicted to their sushi."}
{"text":"Very good sushi!!! Great ambiance, server was very nice. Rainbow roll legit. Happy hour prices are fantastic.  Clean place to eat. Happy to find this place. Thank you Yelp."}
{"text":"Always delish! Nice Happy Hour options! Yum! Sushi Ave is my favorite sushi spot. Rainbow roll and Las Vegas rolls rock and don't forget the sake!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I don't really know what else I can say, it doesn't get much better than Sushi Ave!
They have a wonderful selection of their own unique Specialty rolls with all kinds of crazy ingredients, and the menu has gorgeous pictures of every one of them! Every ingredient is fresh and top-quality. They have THE best salmon sashimi i have had in AZ - EVER. The service is always wonderful with pleasant staff and owners, and the restaurant has great ambiance. The only negative is that every time I go in it is under-staffed and I have to wait a long time - but the quality of food is well worth the wait. I am a huge fan of Sushi Ave!"}
{"text":"The new owners should have realized if its not broken, dont fix it. They changed the entire menu from what was Kampai and now Sushi ave is an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"We absolutely lobe it here. We come as often as possible! The service is great, and the food is amazing, and fresh! We have been coming here for over 4 years! Thank you, for being a great local sushi hangout for our family!"}
{"text":"I have heard of Kampai long before I started Yelping, why it took me so long to go I haven't a clue!  

The restaurant is basically a sushi bar with a dining room attached...no emphasis on the dining room part.  The sushi bar is large enough to fit quite a few people though!  We were seated in the dining area.

Just to test the \"waters\" my wife and I ordered just tetaki, assorted sushi and a few traditional rolls.  I must say it was probably the most professionally handled, freshest fish I have eaten in Phoenix.  I don't know who the owner is, but he knows his stuff!!  Helps that we went on a Thursday (if anyone has read Kitchen Confidential, you know what I mean).

We will be back for more!  My only gripe is our server barely understood english and I don't speak Japanese.  She missed on 2 orders of sushi, forgot one  and brought us something we didn't order.  Another server tried to serve us a few plates that another table ordered.  Was pretty funny though when the table guests saw me playfully reaching for their plate with my chopsticks!

This is one \"character of a restaurant\", if you can put up with the quirks your in for some food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Happy hour prices are amazing! Our new favorite sushi restaurant. We will be back!!! Try the Ultimate California Roll!"}
{"text":"As I sit here and wait for the server to come take our order,  I'm a bit annoyed. I was ready to order with my drinks and was told to \"wait!\".  There are 12 people here now (3 tables) at dinner service and she's running around crazy.  

I sit at the sushi bar thinking we could be served faster, not the case.  

We Ordered the $16.95 dinner combo (beef bugolgi, sushi,  mixed tempura) and a couple of appetizers.  Let's see if they can gain my confidence with the food because this server is going nuts. 

The food was good just unfortunately we caught them on a bad night of no servers"}
{"text":"Fast and very friendly staff! Great happy hour prices. Tootsie Roll sushi was amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't sleep on these folks! I stopped in here for lunch today... interesting story...

'Lunch' for me usually just means 'any meal I eat before 7pm'. Often my mid-day meals fall around 2-5pm, and that is a TOUGH time to get into restaurants. Most everything is closed between lunch and dinner. Not these good folks, though... is it wrong that I almost gave them five stars for that alone...??

So anyhow, I stopped by here at about 3:30pm, and my first impression was that it was a nice little spot. So I saddled up to the sushi bar and took a look at their offerings. Pretty typical fare, and pretty much what you'd expect from XYZ Sushi establishment. Nothing overly surprising, but a decent menu nonetheless. So I ordered a few bits of sashimi, a few cuts of nigiri-zushi, and of course my salmon skin rolls. Everything was really good! Looks like they have a decent selection of sake, and a LOT of home-made infused sake as well. The service was prompt and attentive, everyone was friendly, and the sushi was damned tasty. I was impressed that they serve ama-ebi, and even fry up the head for you. The ikura was equally tasty, and all of the sashimi that I ordered was generous, with a nice heap of daikon.

The salmon skin rolls were top-notch. I liked the little bit of spicy sauce that they put in there, it added a nice little zing.

All in all, this was a solid place. I like the fact that they're open pretty much all day, and they're close to the gym I work out at. I can't really 'rave' about their sushi, because they didn't have a lot of the stuff that I really jam out on (toro, uni, iwashi, etc). What I *CAN* say is that that won't stop me from coming back here after a workout for a quick lean-protein fix. :)"}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this, because Sushi Ave used to be my favorite. Unfortunately, we had a pretty bad experience on our last visit. 

Someone must have called in sick, because they were SEVERELY under-staffed. There was one waiter for the entire restaurant (poor guy), and he had a difficult time balancing all the tables. We waited a long time to place our order, and an even longer time for our food. 

They've changed the menu to include different Asian cuisines, such as Bul-Ko-Gi (Korean) and Orange Chicken (Chinese). I think a Japanese restaurant should stick to serving quality Japanese food, but my husband wanted to try the Bul-Ko-Gi. I got the Chirashi Sushi bowl, and we ordered a Spicy Tuna Roll to share. 

My husband got his food first. We decided to share it, since it didn't seem like my food was coming any time soon. We finished his plate, and then the roll came out. We finished the roll, waited some more, then my food came out. Our waiter was never able to check on us or refill our waters. 

The food was mediocre. The fish wasn't as fresh as I remembered. It certainly wasn't worth the long wait. 

I won't be returning to Sushi Ave. I'll go to Sakana in Mesa instead."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new sushi place, found this one on Yelp. Yelp has never let me down, this place was awesome! I unfortunately had to order it to go, but the woman on the phone was very helpful and nice. To-go Sushi isn't always the best, but their rolls were amazing. When I showed up she just had them packed up, paid super quick and I was out the door. I really like their restaurant, its decorated really different than other Sushi places. They have their own style and a very regulars vibe. I cant wait to take my fiance back so we can dine-in."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is my all time favorite sushi restaurant. We've travelled all over the US and this is by far the best sushi I've had. We're so glad we found this gem!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so although Im tempted to give this place a 1 star, I will be fair and give them 2 because their sushi is always fresh, that is if you have a few hours to wait for it to arrive, with that being said, that is my biggest complaint. I moved to phoenix 5 years ago, this was the 1st place my husband took me to, and I loved it, the sushi was amazing (although their menu is very limited and boring) and their mussels are the best in the valley, they dont stuff it with crab meat, like the other places we went to. However within the past few years, their service has declined tremendously, their host  looks like a kid who does not know much about greeting customers, most of the time looks confused, I havent seen more than 2 servers working on their busiest nights, which ofcourse is a very big problem. We used to like this place also because its pretty close and we thought it would be a convenient location for a quick stop, well that is absolutely not the case, we went there a few days ago, which is definitely our last time, my husband and I had to wait 45 minutes just to get edemame (soybeans), then 30 min later we received our appetizer, now maybe some people dont mind, but I have 2 kids at home and I dont have all the time in the world on a weekday to sit at a sushi spot for 3 hours just to eat dinner. I was so irritated, the server kept apologizing, and ofcourse i know its not his fault, he was waiting for the chefs to prepare our sushi, but they looked like they were in no rush, taking their time chatting away with people sitting in the bar area. The waiter then told me that if we sat at the bar, we would be served sooner, which is complete bullshit, I go to dinner with my husband to enjoy dinner and talk with my husband and not sit at the bar watching them make my sushi, i like my privacy once in a while considering I have 2 little kids at home!!! So 2 hours into dinner we asked for the check before they could finish our 2 last rolls, my husband paid and we left, what a horrible experience, I dont think i was ever that irritated in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! If you are a true sushi fan (I mean real authentic sushi not an all deep fried and CA roll person) you will not be disappointed with this establishment. Throughout the dinner I was given multiple things on the house! Score! I also discovered my all time favorite sushi roll the love love roll!!! This is the best kept secret in phoenix! This place has a normal happy hour Monday-Friday 3-6, and a reverse happy hour from 8- close. There are multiple specials that they offer including a sake tasting for $10. I will definitely be coming back here! And encourage anyone to give it a try you will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, the service was terrible!!! And slow, I'd come back for the food just let me serve myself"}
{"text":"Food is always good and so are the prices. Service however is slow. They have a great happy hour on sushi!"}
{"text":"I can't really say much because nothing happened.  LoL, literally nothing.  I came inside, wasn't sure if you seat yourself or wait for a hostess. There was no sign and nobody came to the front. 

So I sat myself at the sushi bar. Sat for about 15 minutes, nobody helped me, glanced in my general direction, I didn't even see a menu available at the bar. 

I was pretty frustrated (due to my hunger) so I left and went somewhere else.  First time here, it was only half full and I read such good reviews.  I'll give it a 2nd chance next time..."}
{"text":"Pretty great place. My wife and I eat here often and I love the ASU roll and the coconut shrimp. They also have great prices, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is my go to when I have a sushi craving. The sushi has always been fresh and delicious. Come during happy hour, the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is my go to place. Sushi is always great and has a true neighborhood feel. 
Best happy hour specials as well. 
Been coming here for years. 
Only sushi bar for me."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Love Love Roll\" to try something different, no rice, it was my favorite roll by far of the 3 I ordered. Ordered the \"red caterpillar\" it was alright, not a ton of flavor and the jalape√±os were super hot. \"Volcano roll\" was good and what you'd expect. The \"love love roll\" will have me coming back for sure. Spent $37. 
They also brought me out some orange slices for dessert."}
{"text":"Great little place in an out of the way shopping area. Easy to get in and out if your on lunch break. Nice lunch specials and don't forget the FREE appetizer deal here on Yelp! Fresh sushi, fast and friendly staff. A solid choice."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm full and very satisfied. So fresh. Quite the selection of rolls as well. Tgis will be my go to sushi place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is small and kind of a hidden jewel.  Amazing Happy Hour and good drink prices.  We come here often and my favorites are the Jalape√±o Roll and the Sashimi."}
{"text":"This is mine and my wife's favorite sushi place around. The spicy edamame is our go to and everything else we have had is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place in arizona don't ever come here you will regret it waste of time and money believe me . I'd rather eat my dogs food . Horrible service the one lady I saw is a bitch she doesn't have any kind of customer service"}
{"text":"Place is solid always.  We moved from the area and recently just dropped in.  And it is still delicious!  Service was great, and atmosphere hasn't changed laid back and clean."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave has a good happy hour and the quality of sushi is always good! It is a good place in Gilbert for families...they let repeat customers keep chop sticks on the wall for future visits :-)

Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I am not recommending Kampai any longer. Stay away.

I used to eat here a fair bit. At that time the place next door wasn't a karate studio, but a tropical fish store - at least as appropriate, maybe moreso. Kampai Sushi used to be good, I just haven't been to Kampai for quite a while - several years, in fact. Yesterday it was very so-so, in fact below par. The prices are not good, since they are priced as single pieces, & this is the only time I have ever seen sushi served in single piece servings. At $2.50 per piece, it matches the $5 per order (2 pieces) you pay everywhere else. The rice was not tightly packed, and the Tamago (egg) was tasteless. The Hamachi (Yellowtail), usually my favorite also lacked taste, and the eel may not have been too fresh - not actually turned bad yet, but not as fresh as it could have been. Either way, SOMETHING I ate there made my stomach go topsy-turvy & made me feel quite ill. Needless to say, I now know why it's been so long since I have been to Kampai, and it will be a lot longer before I return. Oh, and the owner is still the same guy, and he's a miserable so-and-so, I have never seen a frown which would make such a big grin if it were turned upside-down! My wife was the one who spotted that the eel didn't seem to be as fresh as it should be, though she didn't get sick."}
{"text":"We love Sushi Ave!! Their rolls are imaginative, Large & delicious! My favorite thing on the menu are the crab jalape√±o poppers... they're also BIG!! Happy Hour is inexpensive & has a large assortment menu of starters, rolls & sushi. We will come back again & again... it's our favorite sushi place!!"}
{"text":"Live close by and figured we would give it a try. Very pleased with the atmosphere and the food! Service was fantastic and fast! The quality of the food surprised me with how fresh it was. I would highly suggest anyone that's a sushi connoisseur to give this place a try. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first visit here and loved it. Very tasty! I appreciate that they don't feel the need to pipe in loud club music."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour with great prices. I live right down the street so its nice to have a good place that is convenient."}
{"text":"I'll never eat here again!!! I've never been treated like this by wait staff. I had a groupon and I ordered $50 worth of sushi on the FULL PRICE menu and they would not allow me to use the groupon bc it was during happy hour. Again, I ordered from the full price menu. They just totally ripped me off!!!! I'm still so upset over the way I was treated. I'm going through groupon (who is great to deal with) to get refunded for my groupon I wasn't able to use. Very rude!!! Rip off!!!"}
{"text":"Was craving sushi and wanted to try a new place.  It was average.. nothing special.  It's a bit pricey too for the quality.  Happy hour seems to have some decent prices though.  I ordered a beef tataki which is normally raw beef... we got some cooked up korean bbq pieces which threw me off, don't get me wrong it was good.  The sashimi: salmon & ono (white tuna) two cuts that are usually melt in your mouth perfection.. kinda chewy? Dragon roll is at most average.  Spent too much for what I got."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is within a mile of my house and I have probably driven past it a thousand times, I do not know why we have not tried this hidden gem sooner, maybe it was their location in a strip mall with a Checker Auto parts and a veterinary clinic. I'll admit I am not as adventurous when it comes to sushi places as I should be but the cooked stuff tasted really good. We tries their California roils, Spicy Crab rolls, Las Vegas Roll and some sort of \"volcano\" dish (All I know is they lit it on fire at the table, COOL!). This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Not a bad place in central Phoenix. Size and quality were good and friendly staff. I would recommend you give Sushi Ave a try."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! Third time coming here and the other two times it has been slow (non-happy hour time) but they did have a \"help wanted\" sign out. Two months later decided to try again during happy hour. I sat for OVER an hour and noticed a party, seated 45 mins AFTER me, receive their soup and appetizers. I then asked for my soup and within minutes I got it. The sushi is good but services are horrible. I do understand that there would be a wait for sushi during this time but to have to ask for my soup, after seeing someone seated after me served,is disappointing."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is our favorite place to come for sushi and sake! My husband and I have been coming here for 3 years and have loved every meal. 

Heather is the best. She has such a fun personality and has always been so friendly. She's one of the reasons we keep coming back. 

They have a wall of chopsticks for patrons which we found really fun."}
{"text":"Sushi Ave is the bomb! The New York roll is fantastic and cheap! Definitely making another trip to higley and Guadalupe"}
{"text":"This place is amazing it. The only place I've been to that can compare to it's sushi quality is Shimogamo, and Kampai is MUCH cheaper. Weather you want some basic rolls and nigiri or more \"exotic\" dishes its always fresh and delicious. All the non-sushi menu items I've had were also great. Their katsu is flavorful and succulent, some of the best I've had, although the portion isn't as large as some places.

I'd like to talk a little about the service because I'm surprised by all the bad reviews for it. First, if you sit at the sushi bar I think you can expect amazing service and a fun experience. Second, the table staff is a little less attentive, but in my opinion at most authentic asian restaurants you usually have to make eye contact or motion to them when you want something. I think its a culture thing, they don't like to \"interrupt\" your meal. 
Finally, it's surprising to see how many people complain about the time it takes to get their sushi or how they had to wait 10 more minutes for their carry out. I've never been to a GOOD sushi place where rolls don't take somewhat forever unless you're the only one there. These people who are so concerned about time that they'd give this place a bad review should try Kona or RA, I'm sure their crappy quick sushi will be to your liking.

But if you're looking for top quality at a reasonable price... then relax, enjoy a hot sake and prepare for a flavorful treat. Kampai!(cheers)"}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the Dynamite roll during Happy Hour and it was fantastic!
My wife had the Salmon Box lunch and couldn't get enough of the salmon.

The Edamame was great. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that we have been at sushi Avenue as a family. Every piece of sushi we ordered was fantastic! Can hardly wait to come back again and bring our friends. Highly recommend the ultimate California, the Las Vegas bowl, and be dynamite roll! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times I thought both times the value for the money was great.  The happy hour and lunch specials will keep me coming back.  Awesome Vegas roll.  I judge all sushi restaurants by the Vegas roll! We also had sashimi and spicy tuna roll which were great!"}
{"text":"What a sad day it is when the BEST sushi place in Phoenix is now possibly the WORST!  

New ownership, super unfriendly, awful sauces, the light soy sauce is NOT light but they have it in a light jar and limited sashimi and awful rolls.  No special's, no unique fish, NOTHING about this place is Kampai!!!

Don't waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with the oysters."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for almost 15 years every spring training and this last time was very disappointing.  I absolutely LOVED the mussels, until now.  Don't know what happened, but something changed in the way they make them, blah...  Nothing about the rolls stood out, some were too big to eat in one bite, fish was fresh, just not too creative.  I hope they find their edge again.
The service was awesome though.  We were in the back with a group that included 2 young children and we got alot of attention."}
{"text":"We love the calm atmosphere.  Jalape√±o poppers are great!   Premise but fried to perfection.  Love the fresh sashimi.  Nice flavored sakis.  Sweet server."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday, and the staff was super nice. The service was amazing ! The sushi is super yummy ! I love the detail they use on their presentation. Super cute atmosphere and I also got a yummy cheese cake for my birthday gift. Very satisfied over all ! I definitely recommend it !"}
{"text":"It's the best sushi I've had in Mesa!

The place is a little pricey, but its one of the better places to eat sushi in the Valley.

What I got:
Lollipop Roll. Rating: 3.5/5
Volcano Roll. Rating: 4/5

The Volcano Roll was pretty good - they set it on fire and I was in awe! The lollipop roll was surprisingly good! I came here with a total of five people, so its good for an intimate setting or to talk with a small group of people. 

I'll probably come back to eat here. I definitely recommend this place to eat if you're in Mesa and looking for a Sushi place to eat at."}
{"text":"You should definitely check this place out! The portions are really good and the rolls are really good! The fish was very fresh and good!! The environment is very nice too."}
{"text":"This place was good, but just good. Happy hour sucks bad and the sushi rolls could be bigger for the price you are paying but over all the sushi was very good ."}
{"text":"Took my friend here tonight, awesome sushi, so fresh, love this place!!! Red caterpillar roll, red lobster roll, even the veggie rolls are exceptional.  Reasonably priced, great service everyone is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The place is bigger than you would think.  The sushi was ok.  Service could have been better.  Their water tasted like it was unfiltered tap.  They have a wall full of chopsticks with Patron's names which I thought was interesting.  On each table was a note that if you show your server a Yelp review that you would get $10 off the next visit.  I tried this local restaurant and now it's time to move on."}
{"text":"Being in the desert, you wouldn't believe that such amazing sushi can exist. we've been coming here for the past couple of years, and in my humble opinion it's the best sushi in the valley... maybe the state. the entree menu (non-sushi) is just as delectable! they also have this cute loyalty program were you can get your own personal chopsticks, and they make a display with it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was good. But pricey but maybe I'm not used to sushi prices yet. Presentation was great, cane it on a boat plate. We missed happy hour but it looked life good deals."}
{"text":"Me and my lady had a good experience there. The fish was fresh. She enjoyed the Orange chicken. I think a little high on the price. Over all good place."}
{"text":"Was hungry & looking for a quick bite. Stopped at Sushi Ave and they had happy hour. Ordered Shrimp Shumai as an app & then the Crazy Lobster Roll, Spicy Tuna, and house wine for $25. Fresh fish and delicious. I like these little sushi cafes way better than Kona or RA!! Highly recommend the Lobster Roll!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon for a quick bite.  They offered the happy hour menu, and we got the super white tuna nigiri and the New York roll.  Tasty!  We posted on Instagram so they gave us a free mochi ice cream."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Ave and I was very impressed!! I moved here from Montana and let me just say, the sushi there isn't even comparable to the sushi at Sushi Ave. Not only was the sushi amazing, but the service and cleanliness of the place was outstanding as well. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried several sushi restaurants since moving to Gilbert earlier this year and none compare in quality or service to Sushi Ave. We love it here, and refer it to as \"our place\". They should honestly be the number one rated sushi restaurant in the Gilbert, Chandler, Mesa area."}
{"text":"You can't beat their happy hour specials... Best sushi in the valley of the sun!!!

We eat here at least 2 or 3 times per month and it's always a treat!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place around! I can't get enough of the ultimate California rolls. Great service and excellent food"}
{"text":"Always the best sushi everytime I come! The great thing about it is they are quick as well and don't make you wait long for the food! I always come here!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome cocktails and very friendly staff. Food was fresh and out quick. Will definitely be back. May be my new favorite sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi here. Great people and amazing employees. Hands down would recommend to any sushi lover"}
{"text":"We love Sushi Ave!!!  Nice little place with great Sushi, a good happy hour, and all around good vibe."}
{"text":"I'm a big Sushi fan & not from Gilbert . My best friend Mentioned this place so we tried it . We walked in an the atmosphere and ambiance was amazing ! Farley small , but nice and quiet for one on one conversations.
 The sushi was Great ! I would definitely Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Whoohoo! 100th review on Yelp! 
Sad it's not a five star though. I read reviews. Looked at pictures and was excited to try this place.
We ordered a few apps and sushi rolls from the HH menu and it was all just okay. Chicken wings had a great crispiness and there was a delish garlic sauce just on half
The chicken wing. I wish it came with more sauce. Calamari was disappointing. It was just random cut up sticks that were overcooked and dipping sauce was sour.  Husband enjoyed his shrimp tempura roll and bulgogi. The bulgogi was burnt and had that burnt bitter flavor and came out last. I had the 6 piece sashimi special. Fish was cold but the cuts were a joke. They literally took one normal slice of tuna and cut it in half. The salmon was two whole slices and the \"white fish\" ended up being red snapper. At least they were whole slices. 
I also had the jalape√±o roll. Which was literally a jalape√±o popper in a sushi roll. It was pretty good surprisingly and had the volcano roll. Presentation was cool because they lit it on fire. 
Service was a bit much. The girl we had was the only
One working until just before we left. She constantly
Kept asking if we were ready to order. But when you give me a book of rolls. It's gonna take time for me to read them. Lol. 
In the end. Food was just okay. Edible. Service was okay. There are just other better places. I guess a plus is they offer a large happy hour menu compared to others."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Gilbert and best happy hour specials.  Our favorite for sushi date night."}
{"text":"Well deserved 4 stars.  Came around 4:30 during happy hour.  Quite and nice atmosphere and happy hour prices were fair.

We ordered tempura veggies and jalape√±o poppers to get started.  They were good, poppers weren't to hot for those who don't like them too spicy but the flavor was really good.

We ordered the double spicy, New Yorker, Las Vegas, crazy lobster and ultimate California rolls and an order of orange chicken. The rolls were all good and are fair size rolls.  I'm not a huge orange chicken fan but everyone else were.  I tried a bite and it was good, I could have eaten an order of it and enjoyed it.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A bit out of the way coming all the from Gilbert but was in the area, planning on returning, wprth the drive. Rice was slightly undercooked on sushi but am gonna assume that was a fluke. The bulgogi and Katsu were great."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Gilbert. The PHX roll is my favorite. Nana and Harry always provide great sushi at great prices. Its a nice place that isn't loud and pretentious like other chain sushi places....

And their dumplings are to die for."}
{"text":"great sushi, great prices especially lunch happy hour. love the dynamite roll! you'll know why it's called that when they serve it at your table!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi East of Los Angeles: Being a Los Angeles native, and an avid sushi eater for over 17years, I figured that by moving by to the desert I would have to settle for mediocre sushi. I was wrong. Sushi Ave. is on par, if not better in some ways (price, friendliness), with the best sushi bars in Los Angeles. Sushi Chef James serves up a wonderful array of house specials and traditional sushi dishes that will have you hooked. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a excellent place.  I just went last night for Happy hour.  The happy hour menu was excellent.  The place must be a hidden gem very few patrons.   I think people are missing out best sushi place ever!  Excellent service and I will be returning!  Try the Pink lady, Tootsie roll, Ultimate CA roll and Las Vegas roll.  If you like dessert try the mouchi ice cream."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim last week because it's pretty close to my house.. It was so good at lunch that we ordered take out for dinner that same day! The waitress was very attentive, and the food was amazing... Officially my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley- and I've tried a lot!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Take forever to bring back your check. The lady that runs the place is the rudest human being I have ever dealt with, from any restaurant establishment. Avoid this place at all costs. Their food is barely alright. We used to go all the time because it was cheap but it is no longer worth it."}
{"text":"Great sushi! It was my first time here and the meal was spectacular. The service was great and quick. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the music was lit. 10/10 would do it again."}
{"text":"So Kampai changed hands again.  Not surprising if you read my previous review...  The new Sushi Ave appears to be much better, though not as good as Kampai.  The menu has changed for the better.  They have fresh wasabi available for a small charge.  Perhaps the most interesting change are the infused sake jars that look like science experiments.  I stopped in for a quick lunch.  The service was excellent.  The sushi was decent.  I might just come back again."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Phoenix! Amazing happy hour sushi, and fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, good variety of things. Spicy tuna, and spicy tuna tempura are very good.


The bench outside makes no sense. Auto parts right next door."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their happy hour is amazing! I have been coming here once a month for over a year now and it's turned into a fun and great tradition for my girls and I. I recommend this place to everyone I know for the best sushi"}
{"text":"Under new ownership/staffing now and the quality of the food has declined dramatically. 

A real shame, it was a great old north valley resto."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner before seeing a movie down the street.  I got the teriyaki chicken dinner, which comes with miso soup and salad.  Everything was very good and the price was great, I'll be back for sure.  Even though I didn't order sushi, I overheard the waitress explaining some of the rolls to the table next to me, and she really knew what she was talking about."}
{"text":"This place was really great! The staff was super friendly and the sushi was phenomenal, the prices were also very good!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but have read on here that it is under new management. The are smaller and it does not taste anywhere how the rolls used to taste. They were so good but now they are horrible!  Service is great and only reason giving it two stars. Not going back!!"}
{"text":"I chose the Double Spicy Roll & Ultimate Dragon Roll.  Amazing!!!  You pay what is normal for great sushi.  When it's this good, I do not care what it costs.  They have lunch sushi specials and Happy Hour sushi specials for those who want to save some dough.  The owners are very nice.  I will be going back again, and again."}
{"text":"This place changed owners a couple of years ago. I went a couple of times after the owner change. The decor changed a little. Service was friendly but honestly everything was not nearly as good. I was pretty disappointed. Rice was too warm, rolls were falling apart & not the same, sashimi was not that good. I never came back. Oh well, it was great while it lasted."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Ave a few times and it's okay! It's not amazing sushi or anything special, but it is close by and convenient!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed all of the rolls we tasted. Sushi was as great. It always make me sad the are only coke. :(. We had the Vegas, rolling tiger(yummy), spicy yellowtail, red lobster, ( this was our fav) dragon, baked scallop(this was our least fav) the tempura was very light and good. Thanks for a great meal sushi ave."}
{"text":"As I moved the delectable sushi closer and closer to my tongue and mouth, the aroma that wafted into my nostrils took me on a journey to heaven and back. It wasn't until I tasted the sushi that I knew what true heaven tasted like. My taste buds greeted the spicy tuna roll with open arms and embraced the wasabi that accompanied it. Was it the best sushi I've ever had? Yes, and I'll tell you why. The flavor was to perfection, accompanied with the atmosphere and ambience. Yum yum yum yum yum!!!!!! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. It was so delicious and tasty I loved it. Great workers and awesome service."}
{"text":"Very good! Everything was so delicious the ultimate shrimp roll , The loudmouth role, and the Tiger roll everything !!! The udon soup is especially delicious and the wings are to die for!!! I don't think you can order anything that's not good"}
{"text":"Love this local place! They have such a variety of both traditional & unique rolls that are delicious & fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I was famished when I arrived at this restaurant.  I ordered an appetizer to get food in my stomach as soon as humanly possible.  It ended up coming out after my dinner.  I wouldn't have ordered an appetizer if I had known that would happen. The waitress was prompt, friendly, and helpful.  The food was really good,  and the pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious... best sushi in East Valley! So fresh and seriously would definitely recommend to come here!"}
{"text":"Crazy Lobster Roll is best ever. Seriously. Food is awesome but Lobster Roll is the best. Great prices for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I came in to grab a quick bite by myself, The hostess who also was my server was very sweet when I first walked in. I was the only one in the entire restaurant which made it kind of weird but peaceful at the same time. She asked me if I've been in before and I said no, she asked me if I had any questions about anything which I did not because I'm totally obsess with sushi. I ended up ordering two rolls and the gyozas (dumplings) the food came out quick, fresh, and was absolutely delicious. She even remembered to grab me my Sriracha :) I had an overall good experience and will forsure be back. My roommate also had the teriyaki chicken Togo and he love it!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie the food here is good I have no problem with the food. The service is just way too slow. It's not even that they are bad it's just that it takes forever to get your food. The people are nice, but they def need some more servers or something. I wish that the food didn't take so long because it was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sushi Ave, probably over a year ago now, the food was decent but the service, while polite, was very slow. Today, though, things are much different. First of all, the food has gone from decent to flippin' AWESOME! Can you say flavor? You might get bigger pieces of fish at other places, but the sushi here is excellently chilled (warm raw sushi freaks me out a little) and full of flavor. Unlike many sushi places in the Mesa area, they really have an excellent flavor to their rice, so you end up enjoying it rather than viewing it as filler to go with your fish. 

And that is as far as the food goes. THe service here has improved greatly, too - plus, the staff are super friendly, so if things do get a little slow, all you have to do is flag the waitress down and check on your order. That doesn't happen often, though - no more than the average business. The decor of the place has also improved - so, yeah, that might be a little silly, but the ambience of a place does make a great difference. My first time there, it was just green walls, black tables, no frills, nothing. And if you went into the bathroom, you were blinded by this hiddeous flourescent orange color that blinded you. Bathroom has been redone, they have adorable lanterns and parisols up on the walls overall, a great little place.

My only word of caution is that the place honestly isn't that big. They do have a large table they set up and separate from the room with a screen if you have a bigger group, but if you have more than eight people.... it might be a tad crowded. This place is slighly on the cozy side. Not bad , though.

Go for the Chirashi bowl!! it's delicious!! As are the Hawaiian roll and the volcano!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to officially get on Yelp for over a year now, my wife and I love trying out new places. It must mean something that I am finally placing a review after eating at Sushi Ave. 

I can't understand how anyone gives this place 5 stars. 3? Maybe. 5? No way. I mean, are so many people falling into the management's plan: place an incredibly generic sushi restaurant in the middle of a residential area and hope that our uninitiated taste buds actually enjoy this bland food. Yep, looks like they have some takers. 

First of all, their windows look like they gave children window paint and let them go to town. Apparently there are 3 different happy hours. After entering and taking a look at the happy hours posted I realized that at 2:00 P.M. on a Friday I just missed the cut. The waitress (owner?) yanked the menu out of my hand and sat me down with a tall glass of water. 

I was literally the only patron in there. There was a Japanese man in the back talking loudly on the phone, March Madness was on tv with subtitles and there was Japanese rock music blaring. 

I decided I would delay judgement on price until after my meal. 

I order a lunch combo for $10.95. Their rolls have 8 pieces each and compared to prices for single orders of some of their rolls, two rolls for 11 bucks wasn't a terrible deal. Well, it was. I was immediately brought a very bland batch of miso soup. The \"garden salad\" was a small handful of bagged salad with carrot strips thrown into a tiny bowl and drenched in dressing. The rolls were brought out in about 2 minutes, obviously not fresh. I ordered the California Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll. They tasted exactly the same. I honestly couldn't tell which was which and they were both very bland. Their ginger was honestly the best part. Their wasabi? Mild and not fresh. Their ginger and wasabi are served in medium sized bowls where surely cross-contamination occurs between patrons. The chopsticks are metal, kinda cheap. 

I started this review with a 2 star rating in mind, as I am finishing it I am giving it a 1 star. Meal came out to about $12.00 and I would have only felt comfortable spending $6 for what I received. This place is a joke. 

Management is nice and the Air conditioning works, those are the only positives."}
{"text":"Great experience. We used to love Kampai and had been going there for years.  Then one day a year or so ago we went in and things seemed \"different\" . Atmosphere was poor, fishy smell and the fish quality was off. The wife and I agreed something had changed for the worse. After getting home I consulted Yelp and lo and behold there were a bunch of reviews talking about how the ownership had changed and the place had really slipped. So time goes by and tonight we decided to give Sushi Ave another chance. Wow are we glad we did! Whatever problems they had are fixed and I honestly can say the place is now better than kampai ever was. Kim Chi, soshito peppers, yellowtail scallion roll, cured salmon and Hamachi Kaman. All wonderful. Give Sushi Ave a try you won't be disappointed ."}
