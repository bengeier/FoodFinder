{"text":"J'y suis allée plusieurs fois et chaque fois je n'étais pas celle qui a pris la décision. Vous comprendrez que ce n'est vraiment pas mon restaurant préféré de Laval.
C'est un restaurant où tout est correct, sans plus. Le service est passable. 
Le menu contient beaucoup trop de plats. Un plus petit menu avec des plats d'une plus grande qualité serait apprécié.
Cela dit, le prix des plats est plus que raisonnable. Petit conseil, évitez la crème de poulet (ordinaire) et prenez la salade. Les plats sont gigantesques et même les plus gros mangeurs ne finiront pas leur assiette. Prenez-en une a deux ou préparez-vous à ramener les restants. 
Je n'ai pas de suggestion vraiment intéressante pour ce restaurant, à part peut-être les brochettes de poulet. Les pâtes sont correctes. Évitez les burgers et les desserts. Les déjeuners sont aussi corrects et vraiment abordables."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it is open late and a friend told me about it.

The first time there we took a pizza and some rings and it was decent. The staff is ok but look like they are just there and cant wait for their shift to be over with.

Second time I actually took the time to look at the menu and noticed that it is loaded with so many different things and other than smoked meat they don't really specialize in just one thing. My friend had a smoked meat sandwich that he like but not the best he had. Another person at my table had a burger and she got something that looked like a frozen patty like you buy at Maxi. I took a place from the \"Table d'hote\" and the chicken brochette was ok a little over cooked for my taste and it comes with a salad that was just a regular salad you make at home nothing fancy. 

The worst part in this meal was the dessert (included) you have to choice rice pudding or jello. I took the rice pudding and I was able to only eat one bite this was the worst tasting rice pudding ever. 

I will for sure never go back there again!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a variety of things from this place. Burgers, fries, onion rings, pizza.

They seem not to specialize in anything so I went with it.

I was right.

They don't specialize in anything.

The pizza was mediocre, the fries soggy, the burger average. Nothing memorable.

Wouldn't not order from again."}
{"text":"Ambiance vieillot mais la nourriture est tres bonne .. Surtout la pizza. La lasagne est aussi excellente.

Livraison fut un peu longue et la pizza etait a la limite coté chaleur."}
{"text":"we went here after a hockey game and the place was quiet. it was know for a late night spot but not this night. i actually went there for an espresso and to my shock they do not have. all they have is coffee. regular coffee!!! like wtf... i did try the pizza which was half decent. but no espresso."}
