{"text":"My first time at the boil bar and it has been an amazing experience the service was just as good as the food and the prices are great thanks Rachel for the amazing service"}
{"text":"my friend and i came here for dinner on a saturday using Groupon. i was a bit hesitant at first and was fully prepared to receive second-tier of everything because we were using Groupon. however, this was not the case. everything was just awesome! from the moment we walked in to the end of our meal i could not have asked for a better dining experience. despite being a very busy night the staff provided too-notch service. they were friendly, responsive and super efficient. the seafood here is of excellent quality and delicious with exception of the clams; i found them sandy. we ordered lobster, shrimps, mussels and clams. the meal came with garlic bread and fresh corn and for drinks we ordered what i thought was a pint of their house daft turned out to be 1L each! but for $6.99/L i cant complain. of all the sauces for our seafood, our favourites were garlic and cajun (its spicy but very flavourful)  the reason i did not give a full 5 star was because i felt the tables were too close together and did not give us enough elbow room. consider we have to work for our food with bids and gloves; tables could have been a bit more spaced out. also, while the bathroom is modern, it was a mess with paper towels over flowed and on the floor. pretty unsightly after a wonderful meal. other than that, this location definitely worth a visit if you have never been. recommend!"}
{"text":"Definitely have to submit a review for this place because it's new, and would suggest you try it out in a couple months so they get the hang of their product and service offering, and staff are fully trained on serving the food and prepping drinks etc. The flavours are not bad but because the price is a bit expensive I don't really think it was worth it. The experience was sub par."}
{"text":"Came here this last Sat around 7:45pm with the BF and got a table right away. The restaurant was only about half full as they were still pretty new. This place has the same concept as the much more popular Captain's Boil. I haven't tried Captain's Boil yet, as I've been reluctant to go wait for a table during winter time, so I don't have a comparison.   Basically, there is 3 steps to ordering. Step 1: Choose your seafood by the lb. Step 2: Choose your sauce flavour. Step 3: Choose your spiciness level. There were also some side orders you could order separately. And a sizzling plate combo as well, that includes a sizzling plate served with some boiled items for $12.99. They also have Presotea available here.   We both had a late lunch so, we weren't super hungry. We also couldn't imagine how much a lb of seafood was so we just ordered a bit to see if it was enough. Our order was a lb of Shrimp in the Cajun Sauce, a bit spicy ($11.95), a lb of Mussels in the House Sauce, a bit spicy ($9.95), and an order of French Fries ($3.95). Surprisingly that was enough to get us decently full already. I guess if we were normal hungry we would have needed another lb of seafood or so.   I don't know if the waitress who took our order wasn't good at English or just couldn't hear me, but she seemed to have trouble understanding my order. So I ended up pointing at everything. They stick a piece of paper with your order on your table right after they put in your order, so you can double check if they got your order right. I totally didn't even bother looking, and when I got the bill, I noticed that both my orders of \"a bit spicy\" ended up being \"mild spicy\". Don't know how much of a difference it would have made, but I might have enjoyed the food a bit more had it actually been \"a bit spicy\"  The tables were covered with paper, and you got a plastic bib, a pair of disposable gloves, and a roll of paper towels. That's all you get to eat with, so it got very messy. The seafood came in plastic bags. The second they placed the bags on the table, there were large oily red stains on the paper covering the table already, which was slightly unappetizing. Of the two sauces we order, both me and BF liked the House Sauce more than the Cajun Sauce. You could taste the spice, the garlic, and the butter in the House Sauce. While the Cajun Sauce was just really salty and spicy. I liked the Mussels better than the Shrimp as well, partially because I'm a lazy butt that doesn't like to peel shrimp, but the shells of the mussels did help scoop more sauce up so it was also more flavourable. The BF claims the shrimp were frozen shrimp, but I couldn't tell as the Cajun sauce was too salty and spicy for me and covered all the taste of the shrimp. Both sauces were a bit oily for our liking. I ordered fries hoping to be able to dip them in the sauces, but it was too oily, so I ended up using the ketchup they provided instead. The fries were a mix of crispy fries and regular straight cut fries that you can buy frozen. Pretty standard. Not a fan of the straight cut fries so left some of it untouched as I was getting full. Next time I would get the sweet potato fries instead for the same price.  Service generally was pretty good. They checked on us after we got all our food. And always refilled our waters before they became empty. Which was very important as I was quite thirsty from the food.   I think this kind of concept of eating boiled seafood with your hands is kind of fun. Worth trying at least once. Obviously you could probably boil your own seafood at home for a lot less, but its great that you can make a complete mess and not have to worry about cleaning it up yourself. Food was ok, not amazing. I gave them a 3 because the service was alright and I've never had this kind of food before, so I have no comparison. I might be back if my friends want to try this kind of concept of seafood and don't want to go too far, but not in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"This place is in the heart of Scarborough in a plaza with loads of parking. We ordered the Cajun medium spice shrimps, house sauce lobster, fried octopus balls, and baked cheesy mussels. The flavours, prices, portions, and service are comparable to Captain Boil. The bonus about this spot is the free parking, the sides and the great selection of bubble tea!! A heads up, get here earlier if you want to be guaranteed a parking spot otherwise you'll have to park at the No Frills lot and walk over. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Went late Saturday afternoon (around 6pm) with my boyfriend. The restaurant wasn't filled to capacity, but it was fairly busy. We had to flag down a waitress to be seated, and she didn't seem entirely thrilled to be working there. Ordered 1lb of the mussels and clams in garlic sauce, which was delicious. Also ordered 1lb of shrimp in mild Cajun sauce, which was a miss because there wasn't much flavour.   Left the place not full nor satisfied. Wouldn't come back again for such a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"taste good. But a little salty for me and my friend. We order 59.99 combo,including 1bl shrimps, 1bl calm, 1bl sausage, 1bl mussels?1bl lobster?four oyster?and some squid ring, fries. A little much for two people.  Environment looks good and don't need too long time to wait which is good for me. But food easy to get cold . This should be improved"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Price: ~$50 for 2 people  Ordered the mussels with garlic sauce, crawfish with house sauce, and raw oysters. Highly recommend the garlic sauce and the raw oysters. Crawfish was good but was not a big fan of the house sauce."}
{"text":"The place is nice and spacious and the food is good if you know what kind of flavours you like. If you don't then I would recommend talking to the one girl that works there with the long pony tail that can speak fluent English (Philipino).The other girls there are not very attentive and don't seem to give a shit about learning the menu and would leave the work to the girl that can speak fluent English.   I don't know her name but she is very attentive and even recognized me and my boyfriend from the first visit.   It's kind of sad that this review I'm giving is to praise the Philipino girl and nothing else. Food is good but not spectacular"}
{"text":"I visited Boil Bar on a Saturday evening, it was not too busy, so that was good.  The shrimp was fresh and tasted good, and so did the mussels.   One thing I would have done differently was kick my spiciness level up a notch. I had the Kraken Sauce - Spicy which was not really spicy, so next time I'll be trying the Explode as that might give it a good kick.   I didn't care for the chicken wings, it had too much batter and plain. So you can pass on this, not worth it.   The baked lobster was also delicious, nice presentation too.   I will definitely try this again. It is a nice space and good for 2+ people."}
{"text":"This particular location had super friendly wait staff. Music was a special kind of hell from dance/pop to melancholy. Decor itself was lovely and clean inside.  Did not like the menus on the tablets as it was limited, not necessary. Also prices were incorrectly listed.  In my opinion, the corn and potatoes would be much more tasty if placed in the bag of whatever boil bag you ordered, we did this and enjoyed the seasoning.  Ordered sausage, recommend not doing this as it was really disgusting.. like the mystery meat with horrible texture.  The seasoning itself was amazing. The draft was not listed on the menu, but was a good price (amber ale).  The lobster bisque we ordered was too creamy for my taste, also did not appreciate it being microwaved (hate when restaurants do that). Half the light fixtures were not operational, made us wonder if they were saving on hydro.  Also another patron complained as the price reflected on the tablet was not what was on the bill. Management poorly handled the situation saying he could not do anything about the $20 price discrepancy. As a manager myself, you can always do something for your patrons..especially as this place is clearly struggling.  Would not go back again and would rate this an average experience."}
{"text":"really good taste?This is my first time to the boil bar on yonge! We will be back again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good service, great hours, and pretty good food.   We tried oysters, shrimp, mussels, and the house beer.  Oysters were 6 for $12; somewhat expensive for Scarborough but fairly good.   Shrimp and mussels were quite good with varying sauces. Shrimp were not de-veined (I think that's the norm for these places, but for some people that's a  deal breaker). The sauces weren't as good as Captain's Boil in my opinion, but still fairly flavourful and more than enough in quantity.   The $1 beer is about what you'd expect, but a welcome addition to any establishment that opens until 2am.  Overall,it's not quite as good as Captain' s Boil but it comes close. Especially for being this far north/east, it's an excellent option!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends last night. I enjoyed it very much, we ordered shrimp, mussels, clams and crawfish. The shrimps were decent size, mussels were pretty big, clams were a normal size and crawfish was a tad small but its because its hard to import over to Canada. We also ordered the seafood fried rice, meh- i'd prefer plain rice and also the fries which were costco fries which were fine. I've been to Captain's boil and i think that the boil bar is way better, less buttery, greasy and salty! Service was also good and attentive. I've been the Hot N' juicy and The Boil  in NY and Vegas and I would say its quite comparable. I would def return!"}
{"text":"Does anyone else here feel a bit sick after considering the amount of waste being produced at these restaurants?   Plastic bibs, plastic bags, plastic gloves-- is this even necessary for these seafood boil restaurants to continue making good food?  My friends and I aren't environmental vigilantes, but in the time of climate change, it's obvious that restaurants should stop creating piles of plastic garbage.   If you're listening, Boil Bar, here's the real question: wouldn't your food taste better if it didn't come out of a steaming, greasy plastic bag?"}
{"text":"They should make sure the seafood are clean and fresh..both my friend and I having food poisoning after dinner. my stomach doesn't feel well after, my friend have red marks all over his body and his eyes were swelling. The second day, i vomited, stomach ache,dizzy,and feeling cold&sweating. my friend had diarrhea, and the food infections are still with him..you should consider what you are selling to the customer,being tasty is important,but being clean and healthy for customer is most important"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to this new restaurant. Of all the seafood boils that I have tried, this is my favourite. I recommend the house (Kraken) sauce. Try the baked lobster, the shrimp, the mussels, clams and the raw oysters. Crayfish are a waste of time and money at any seafood boil, so don't try them. The sweet potato fries are a must. This is the only seafood restaurant in the area, so it should become very popular.  I liked the servers and the service."}
{"text":"I used coupon from an app. We only spent $24 per person including everything. Delicious and good service. I will be back again! We have four people, all of us checked in on Yelp. But the waitress told us only one person can get the free pop. 3 of us have to pay for the drinks. That's so sad:("}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food, small portions.  Thought we'd try this out after getting a Groupon Deal for $40 for 2. We chose to go with the Dungeness Crab, Mussels, Corn and Garlic Bread. We started with the mussels in Cajun sauce - LOTS of garlic and a little bit spicy but overall pretty good. Portion size was good for two and the spice level was just right.   The real showstopper was the crab! Thought that they would use sub-par crab since it was dunked in sauce anyways but the crab was of good size and tasted fresh! We got it with the Signature sauce (Highly recommend) which is a mix of all their sauces with strong hints of the Cajun, curry and garlic ones.   Service was also good and prompt, we were seated right away, there was a steady flow of food and we had a really friendly server who happily explained the menu, her recommendations and honored our Free Soda Yelp Check in after the meal.   Only downside was that we were both still a bit hungry after the meal and if we paid full-price, it would be a tad pricey for the small portions! Overall, great experience and pleasantly surprised at the taste/ quality of seafood!"}
{"text":"Food - 3 star (3.5 actually) Service - 3 star Concept - 4 star Price - 5 star  I visited them during Order the Yelp event to try their Spicy Sichuan shrimp. It was 50% off, so for 6.50 $ it was mad value. I wasn't very hungry and I couldn't finish it all. I also ordered a bowl of rice (1.50 $) , 1 sweet corn (1 $)  and a beer (0.99 $). A glass of beer was just 0.99 $ (I didn't believe it first when i saw it on the menu, but i ordered anyway. I believed when i saw it on the bill). The total bill was 15$ including taxes and tip. Just wow !  Food was decent. I found the sichuan sauce too oily. Plus the shrimps were whole (not de-veined and with head and tail intact). Not that i was expecting anything more for the price (it surpassed my expectations that way), but for the dilemma whether to eat them as they were or to patiently remove the head/tail/shell and just eat the meat. And you know what, being as hard working individual as I am, I chose the latter. So, I spent next one very tiring hour meticulously extracting every morsel of meaty goodness out of it and then devouring it. Needless to say I slept like a baby after.  Concept is very nice. The food is simple. The prices very reasonable. They provide the apron, gloves and a roll of bounty so your clothes and their restaurant remains clean. The serve food in food grade plastic bags, use plastic glasses for drinks(even beer) which is different.   Service could be better. Even though the food was served very quickly. The waitress seemed disinterested to explain about the dish. And when we walked, we realized that everyone was ordering the same dish (as if all yelpers, decided to give them the privilege to serve them).   I'll definitely be back. (probably after reading the reviews and knowing about things which do not require so much effort to eat or making up my mind to eat them as they are served)  PS - They do not except cards for less than 15$ or less."}
{"text":"The concept was cool, but the seafood was not fresh at all. Lacking in flavour, shrimps were not cleaned, ordered cajun sauce and everything just tasted like garlic. do not waste your money!!"}
{"text":"I was back again today for lunch and once again had an excellent meal. I had the sizzling hot plate with shrimp and rice. My bag of seafood included shrimps, sausage, mussels and sweet corn in a mild cajun sauce. I also had a side order of sweet potato fries. As an aside, I have tried to make sweet potato fries at home, but they do not compare to the Boil Bar's. I noticed some new BBQ items on the menu but did not try them. I saw another customer order them and they looked tasty.. Some new desert items looked terrific, but since I am trying to lose weight, I passed on desert.  Service was fine. While I was there a young woman picked up a take out order and a bicycle courier picked up a meal for a delivery."}
{"text":"First off food was tasty but I felt slightly unwell after my dinner.   Secondly, when I had requested the lobster as part of the groupon combo, i was never informed that I will only be getting 2 tails and 1 claw. When I bought this up to the first waiter, he made a joke out of it asking us if we want steroids to \"beef up\" the lobster.. ha.ha. No thanks.   With the second waitress, she not only did not take the blame for the situation but had told us that we are LUCKY to have lobster at this price with the decline in supply. They might not even have lobsters for next week. Well that's next week and you should not be cutting corners to meet this weeks quotas. Oh, right they also said we probably got a defective one.. I am just angry with how the situation was dealt with and poor customer service.   All in all, I just wanted to tell them they SHOULD be informing customers ahead of time if they are not going to fulfil the orders.  I will NOT be returning and I advise all Groupon users to confirm they have sufficient ingredients before ordering because \"they are running short on ingredients\""}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (50% of final grade) I would give the raw oysters here a 4.5/5 stars, but that was only a specific appetizer we ordered. But the majority of the other food was a 2.5-3 at best. So, first of all, the raw oysters. Oh. My. Mamamia. My family has purchased fresh crates of oysters for family bbqs before, but those did not compare with these ones. These ones were very fleshy, creamy, and juicy fresh to the point of oblivion (okay, SLIGHT exaggeration, but you get my point--they were GOOD). I slurped down those medallions in zero seconds. We also ordered a pound of dressed mussels (cooked), two combos, and a bowl of noodles. The first one was deep-fried fish fillet with rice and a nicely-portioned bag of seafood, and the second was shrimp with udon, with its own little bag of seafood. Both were served on a metal skillet and topped off with some shredded cheese and teriyaki sauce. The bags of seafood consisted of some mussels, big succulent shrimps, a half cob of corn, sliced red sausages and mini clams. This might be just personal preference, but I like to taste the sea in my seafood. Unfortunately, the sauces were much too over powering to taste the seafood. I went there last night and left at 12AM. I brushed my teeth for a long time and drank a lot of water and today I still have that MSG taste stuck in my mouth. But those oysters though. Those... oysters... though.   Ambience 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) The place was surprisingly dainty for the carnage that goes on when you dig your grimy, gloved hands into the sauces and seafood. I liked it! I would actually recommend this place for a date, surprisingly, despite it being very casual and no nice clothes could be worn in the presence of splashy sauces. Test the depth of their affection for you when you are head-into a bag of seafood, pigging out on the goodness of food. I liked how they had nice fitting plastic gloves and cute little bibs for you.   Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) My older sister knew one of the ladies that worked there, so my experience might be slightly unrepresentative, since we got preferential treatment in terms of service from her. I'll evaluate the other lady that helped us though--the one my older sister didn't know. Simply put, she was very standard, if not below. Yes, yes, I know you want to go home (it IS 11PM), but please, chill. I wasn't even finished my mussels, woman, why u take away my mussels and force me to eat the last piece hastily?!  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Alright price for food. The oysters are only $2 each, so that was very nice! I would probably go there for an oyster indulgence day MWAHAHA. The noodles there are also fair in terms of price. You can probably get a nice dinner here for less than $20, tips, tax, food, etc.  Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) Cheers for the love of oysters.  Final Grade = 59/100 = 3 shiny, shiny, shiny stars  TLDR: My beloved oysters, wait for my return for you and only you. I shall bring friends to indulge in grimy food business."}
{"text":"I went there once,only because I wanted to eat BBQ food at that time. Ordered claims with potato and shrimps with corn. Signature sause is way much better than the garlic one. I was so satisfied when I ate the food.Host are friendly and polite BTW.  However, my belly felt so pain after I arrived home.And I have  suffered over 24 hours diarrhea since that. I think it may cuased by the not really fresh seafood. I felt so bad and disappointed, I think I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Nice dim, clean atmosphere, quick but not overbearing service, and a lot better in terms of having a huge roll of good quality paper towels and unlimited disposable gloves box. I got the mussels (I counted 20 so that's a really good deal in my mind) in house sauce (mix of the various) and mild spicy for 11 dollars. I also added red sausages for 5 dollars (there were so many slices like around 20 so I shared with my friend) and a piece of sweet corn (very sweet and flavourful) for 1 dollar. The sauce was quite delicious, although a little too salty. There was also a Presotea menu, and i love Presotea, for normal price. I didn't order one because we were going to go for tea after. Prefer this over Captain's Boil because of the red sausage on the menu. :) That free crispy fresh garlic bread too tho."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Father's Day with my family. We were directed to a table right away. The interior decor caught my eye, they had cute seafood themed murals and a fishnet on the ceiling. The service was great, the waitress was really patient with us because we were indecisive on what to order and even gave us recommendations. She also came around to refill our waters frequently. We ordered two of the rices on hot plates (one fish filet and one chicken), an order of shrimp and an order of the duchess crab. The concept of eating the seafood in bags was pretty interesting and a fun experience. The seafood was fresh. My family enjoyed the garlic sauce, but the house sauce didn't really suit our taste. We also got a side of corn, which was actually my favourite part. Overall it was a great experience. We got to watch the nba game, they had a presotea menu were we got to order bubble tea, and enjoyed a unique eating experience with my family! Would definitely go again to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Love this new location and the decor. Staff was friendly and attentive.  Love the baked Oysters (we had like 8 of them) the raw oyster is very good priced as well. Had the 1 lb of shrimp with Kraken Sauce -mild spicy and 1 lb of clams (Moby dick sauce and mild spice) as well.  Everything was good and since it was grand opening was offered 15% off by sharing my food on social media.  Will be back for more"}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice and trendy, with seafood related things on the walls. They also teamed up with Preso Tea so you can have Bubble Tea as you eat seafood boil. I actually found the combination pretty good as the milk tea washes the spiciness of the boil sauce.  NOTE: I haven't tried Captains Boil yet so I can't compare it to that.  All in all, a very delicious seafood join. The seafood are very fresh and the sauces have a variety that are different from one another. My favorite sauces are the Garlic and House Sauces.  1. Fanny Bay Oysters: these are sourced from Diana's Seafood and I'm already a fan of Diana's for Oysters. So this is a win!  2. Craw Fish in Cajun Sauce (Mild Spicy): If you're not used to craw fish, you might be thinking what's the point of getting them. For me, these are micro lobsters. And being micro, the meat is tastier than big lobsters. There's a trick to getting the meat out of craw fish so be sure to research beforehand so you don't get frustrated.  What I didn't like about this boil in general is that the sauce doesn't really go into the meat since it is covered by the shell. I wish they split the head and body first before tossing it in the boil so the sauce has a chance to go in. I couldn't really taste the Cajun sauce except if I dip it in after removing the meat. The Mild Spicy is very mild.  3. Mussel in Garlic Sauce (A Bit Spicy): I really loved this. The taste of garlic isn't too strong to overpower the seafood but just enough to heighten the flavour. As a spicy food lover, I enjoyed the A Bit Spicy level than the Mild.  4. King Crab Leg in Lemon Pepper Sauce (A Bit Spicy): The most expensive of the choices. The King Crab is meaty and flavourful on its own. I wish they cracked this going into the bag because the sauce didn't really get that much into the meat. Some parts of the crab also has very pointy shell so it maybe painful to hold it with your hands. This is why I stay away from King Crab in general and prefer my other seafood choices.  5. Clams in House Sauce (Mild Spicy): I really loved the clams. Much more than the mussels I think as this reminds me of eating Manila Clams. So fresh and delicious. And the sauce really sticks to the clam so you get the full-on flavour. The House Sauce is so delicious!  6. Baked Lobster: OMG I really loved this. The meat was so tender and flavourful and the cheese is just oozing out of this dish. Loved it! And it wasn't overcooked.  7. Grilled Sweet Corn (Dessert): This was the first time I had something like this. It's very unique and delicious. Corn lovers will definitely love this."}
{"text":"Just go to Captain's Boil instead. I'm giving 2 stars only for the quick & attentive female Asian server who took over our table. Food came out slow even when the place wasn't packed. Shrimps were not fresh. Crabs were small and not cleaned well at all. Sauces were ok but the garlic one was not flavourful. Table beside us didn't finish ordering 5-10 minutes after we did and they got their food first. When we asked our original server, she said \"Well it depends on how easy your food is.\" Lol ok that's my cue to never come here again where everything is boiled and \"difficult\" to make."}
{"text":"I purchased the groupon... should the reviews... takeout /eat in seafood... yikes I don't recommend it! Shrimp weren't detained and the lobster was so small it made me feel bad eating it... felt creepy and cheap to eat out of a plastic bag"}
{"text":"Awesome seafood! Great deal and the sweet corns are perfect! Highly recommended to enjoy the lobster and clams! The environment is very good too. Highly recommended for friends and family."}
{"text":"Went here one evening to celebrate my friends birthday. We ordered muscles, calamari, deep fried octopus balls, baked lobster, and shrimp udon bake. We first received the octopus balls, they were disgusting and overly gooey, with an extremely small piece of octopus. Second we received the calamari, it was extremely bland, and came with a side of mayo, with not many options for sauce. The udon bake was even more disgusting, it was bland noodles, and a heaping pile of mayo on top with a dust of cheese. I am allergic to mayo so I told the waitress I could not eat it.   The menus had no indication that there entire menu consist of ONLY mayo, and after letting the waitress know i was unable to eat the mayo in the noodles, she failed to let me know that the Lobster bake ALSO has a heaping pile of mayo on it, to deceive that they used a lot of cheese when in reality it's a dust of cheese on top.  We revived the lobster, after noticing the lobster has mayo as well, I let the waitress know again I could not have mayo, if I can have it without any. For over 10 min the waitresses left the lobster on the table with my food allergy, and refused to remake it.   We then got a new waitress, and she kept telling us that we indeed have to pay for the lobster, even though I can't eat it with my allergy. The waitress argued for another 10 min saying that the cost is going to be expensive for them, and basically I should take the lost for the cost for something I could not eat.   The waitress was not even willing to make the lobster without any mayo, which I had requested before hand. This is probably the WORST food in Toronto, not even comparable to the Captains Boil!  Service sucks, food sucks, waiters are rude, experience on a whole, SUCKS!"}
{"text":"We waited for almost an hour even though we had a reservation. Luckily they gave us free bbt as compensation.   The food was ok. Most of the flavour comes from the sauce, which was good, but the freshness of the seafood is all gone...all gone. Overall, it was ok for the price of seafood but not that special."}
{"text":"Appreciated the friendly service, cute decor, and reasonably tasty food (though to be fair, it was pretty foolproof prep/ all just boiled and sauced, and the sauce on my main dish was just alright).  However - and to be clear, I don't even identify as an incredibly 'green' person - the one thing I refuse to go back because of is the fact that my meal alone produced a disturbing amount of waste: plastic bibs and gloves; two thicker plastic bags for each of my dishes (which, as an aside, contributed to sloppy presentation); plastic-coated \"tablecloths\"; disposable cups, plates, and napkins - when asked, a server admitted that it's all easily balled up within the table covering and tossed away at the end of each meal.  So much of this could be substituted with reusable materials, and the undoubtedly solid profit margins of this boil-and-go kind of concept must Definitely be able to cover the upfront costs of said substitutions, so while I'd be happy to both recommend and personally come back to this restaurant if the material shortcomings proved to be a temporary feature of it, I couldn't enjoy the one meal I've had here while stomaching the irony around half of my meal's leftovers ending up wrapped around fish in the ocean.  P.S. the Groupon wasn't that great a deal either, in retrospect!"}
{"text":"So we went back to this place for a quick dinner today, and we've noticed a few changes since my last review. First off, they have alcohol on the menu. Decently priced, but limited selection.  Service has improved significantly, and the overall experience was much better. We weren't very hungry today, so we ordered shrimp, mussel, potatoes, and fries. As the food came, they gave us garlic bread, on the house, which was a nice gesture.  Compared to 3 months ago, they improved their cooking. This time, the seafood was not overcooked, and potatoes were not undercooked. Sauce was a little bland still. The cajun and house sauce tasted very similar even though we had varying degrees of spiciness.  There was also another nice surprise when we checked in. An offer for 10% came up, which was pretty cool of them. Overall, I'd say this place is now worth the money especially if you enjoy seafood."}
{"text":"Well, it's kinda hard to find a proper Chinese barbecue in downtown Toronto, but the boil bar made it a step closer. I'd call my friends to come here again. However be noticed that some dishes are not so infused with flavor."}
{"text":"Shrimp not okay, it was mushy and not firm.  Sizzling plate picture is hella misleading. Looks like a giant piece of chicken but they give you chicken nuggets from Wendys.  Sauce is alright."}
{"text":"I haven't gotten to step foot inside or order takeout because the Boil bar (like others have complained about actually ) doesn't like to stick to their hours.   Every time I've attempted to eat here, they are either never opened or they closed earlier.   The servers don't really speak English either so it was a big headache to try to order on the telephone.   I hope to be able to update this review later on if I ever get to try the food."}
{"text":"I've been walking by this restaurant for weeks now and it was always under construction. I called the Yonge Street location to obtain an opening date but they were being very hush hush. I now understand why. They have been open, what? Two days? And the news that The Boil Bar has opened spread like wildfire. I had friends texting me left right and centre to go and eat there. I'm inside Home Depot grabbing RAID and the staff were already planning when to go eat there! Two days! Seeing as I love seafood and live a block down, I decided to check it out myself last night.   Interior: very minimal compared to the Yonge location. I prefer this, personally. There are still a few things they need to work on (I.e., the \"sorry, no debit\" sign, their washroom signs, and the downstairs dining area). I anticipate great things.   Concept: you get down and dirty with your food. Simple as that. No utensils, no plates, no table centre pieces. All you get is a bib and a pair of gloves. You would get a cracker / and or a pair of scissors for the crab legs or the lobster. There was a table beside me that got their lobster and was displeased that it didn't come already broken apart for you. And the fact that it came in a plastic bag, which was plopped down on the table was not appealing to them either. They started speaking ill of such a concept to their waitress whom I quickly figured out was not fluent in the English tongue. I was ready to intervene, but I saw another server come to her aid and politely told... educated them that this concept is not new, and has been around for many years down south. To their surprise, she added that down south they serve you the seafood in a bucket and actually toss it onto the table instead of serving it in food safe plastic bags. The customers snapped back with \"and this is why Americans elected Trump.\" So uncalled for.   iPads: I can see this being a plus and a downside, they use iPads to order. The Annex area has a mixture of both old and young. I noticed the servers completely leave certain customers to do things on their own (because they were capable) and some, were being literally babysat because the concept of ordering yourself was just too overwhelming. I understand why it's being used and it's not a bad idea. You order, eat and maybe want some more. Your server is busy and can't grab you a menu, oh wait I have it with me on my table already. Oh no, I don't want what I picked out. It's okay, I can go to My Order (essentially your shopping cart) and remove the menu item and add another one. Works for me. Saves me the trouble of having to flag her down.   Food: the shellfish is boiled and then tossed into a plastic bag with the sauce and spice level of your choice. I'm a student so I opted for the Main Combo which is $15.99 for 1/2 lbs shrimp 1/2 lbs clams and 1/2 lbs mussels. A 1 lbs bag of shrimp is already $12.95 so this makes sense to me. You can also add broccoli, mushroom or zucchini to your bag for $3.00. Again, this makes sense. We're so used to associating a pound with chicken wings. These things are breaded and deep fried in oil. That alone fills you up. You're only eating protein basically so you could potentially be left unsatisfied in terms of fullness factor. The veggies really do hit the spot. I got mine with the Leviathan sauce which is their Louisiana Cajun seasoning. Oh one more thing, the sauce descriptions are not all there on the iPad. Might want to fix that, or it gives servers a reason to interact with the customers. They have all sorts of other sauces but I'll let you guys figure those out for yourselves.   They added lots of new menu items compared to the Yonge street location and will have to come back for those. Particularly the walnut shrimp, their lobster chowder and clam soup.  Staff: they're literally still getting their shit together. And you can clearly see it. I was told The Boil Bar isn't a franchise, it's a family / investors owned business. These restaurants take time to find their place and momentum. They have a mixture of knowledgeable staff and training staff. It's painfully obvious who is who but hey, at least they're trying! They're all very friendly and eager to serve. They work collectively together as it's not sectioned off. They're right in the heart of a food strip, so I'm sure they'll do well!   Overall, welcome to the neighbourhood Boil Bar! We expect to see great things from you guys!"}
{"text":"So after going to both locations, and only having Captain's Boil as a comparison, here stole my heart. The sauces at Boil Bar are much much cleaner. You can tell they don't put any artificial food colouring in their sauces and I don't taste MSG, which has a very distinctive flavour. The seafood is fresh and cooked just right. My friends and I ordered the shrimp, mussels and clams. They are very proud of where they get their seafood from. Oh and they give you pop in a bottle, which just ups their wow factor. Tastes better in a bottle in my opinion. We also got a few appetizers to share: fried sweet potatoes, seafood fried rice and onion rings. Hands down the best sweet potatoes I've had! They melt in your mouth! The onion rings were really good too. This may sound \"hipster,\" but if they ever decided to make their own ketchup like Wanda's Pie in the Sky, I think they'd do well! The seafood fried rice was bigger than expected and our server brought us bowls which made it perfect since I didn't want the extra sauce in our bags to go to waste. Bare in mind, the Boil Bar is just setting themselves up so it's nowhere near as busy as Captain's Boil, but I'd rather a restaurant who succeeds with quality, rather than quantity. I've come across their blogTO post and they have lots of new menu items rolling out just in time for winter! Can't wait to go back and try them!"}
{"text":"We checked this out on a Friday night with a large party of 11. I called the Monday of the same week to get reservations and unlike Captain's Boil, Boil Bar were willing to book us which is why we went with them.   The concept of a seafood boil was new to pretty much everyone in our party so it would have been nice to have the server explain it (versus myself who just googled it).   We went into this expecting it to be very messy (we even opted to wear dark colours haha) so the buckets, bibs and gloves were a nice suprise.   Between the 11 of us we managed to order almost everything on the menu (shrimp in 3 different sauces, crab, lobster, oysters, crawfish, sizzling plates and a number of sides). Personally I got the corn and the shrimp in the lemon pepper sauce. I loved my order but reviews were definitely mixed for the rest of the table. The house sauce wasn't as well liked while the curry sauce was definitely popular. A serious miss for us was the crawfish. They were extremely small with virtually no meat and the two people who got that definitely regretted it. The lobster and crab went over better.   The four star rating is really for my order (Lemon Pepper Shrimp, Corn and Calamari). Taking my friends opinions into account it'd probably land somewhere between 2-3/5."}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for The Captain's Boil after the yelp elite event but I came here last week with some friends because of a Groupon deal.  The seafood is fresh, and the garlic sauce is YUM. So good that I saved the bag of sauce and used it to drench all other seafoods into it! I even used it to drizzle over the seafood fried rice, which I was super glad to find that it wasn't cajun/spicy (like it is as Captain's).  However, this location said they were out of lobster so as part of our Groupon, we were limited to ordering the crab. Also, after going home and doing some calculations, I found that the Groupon really doesn't save you much and in fact, reduces the flexibility of your order (have to get corn and garlic bread).  Overall, the food was still great and I'd say it's fairly comparable to Captain's Boil. Would come back on occasions (since seafood still isn't cheap after all)!"}
{"text":"This place is similar to captains boil but it's a bit cheaper. We got the $8.99 for sizzling plate and a small bag of seafood! A lot of garlic though for all the different sauces"}
{"text":"The Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab Caesar is truly one of the most unique cocktails out there with an entire soft shell crab on top of it and fitted with two shrimps, celery, and olives for eyes.  It was cute as well as edible.  The Caesar was strong too but tasted good.   The Deep Fried Chicken Wings were small in size -- there were 3 drumsticks and 3 wings -- but nicely fried and seasoned."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it's the worst disappointment ever!!!! Been to captains boil before and the menu is the same but they actually charge more then captains boil. Well already sat down so ordered 2 pounds of clam and 1 lb of crawfish. When the food came it came in a bag as expected. When I tried the food though there was no taste and the food was barely warm. The crawfish had nothing inside of them and the seafood didn't even taste fresh. I would not recommend anyone to go to this place at all."}
{"text":"The crawfish were boiled perfectly and really yummy!  Using your hands to eat seafood is always a different experience than using the common knife and fork.  The Cajun Sauce wasn't very strong.  I really enjoyed the sweet corn and sausage (in all of the bags)!  The corn was definitely sweet and the red sausage added a different texture to the seafood all night long."}
{"text":"Having had success in their uptown store, The Boil Bar has expanded a flagship store near the busy intersection of Yonge & Bloor at 664 Yonge Street.  You can get there by either walking from Yonge & Bloor subway station or Wellesley subway station.  What is different at The Boil Bar's seafood boils compared to other ones is that they infuse alcohol into their seafood boils and cocktails!  We were all looking forward to trying out these alcohol-infused seafood boils!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the service. I would not recommend this restaurant to even my worst enemy. The food was subpar. My friend took a bite of the lobster and immediately spit it out. Upon sending it back we were then confronted by a waitress about 5 times and she was arguing with us about the lobster. The manager then came out to speak to us. Never in my life have I been spoken to so rudely. The staff and manager need to take a class on how to interact with customers."}
{"text":"Recently heard about The Boil Bar via Instagram and knew I had to go check it out because I've been dying to try out this new boiled seafood trend ever since Captain's Boil came to Toronto! Captain's Boil pretty far for me to go, so imagine my surprise and excitement when it was close by!  I arrived around 5PM and it was still pretty empty since it's still relatively new - which I don't mind since I don't want to wait anyways. Was seated quickly, even though the waitress didn't look like she had a lot of training...  The decor was fitting towards the theme - big murals of seafood and even seafood catching cages on the side to divide the restaurant. Bibs, plastic gloves and a roll of tissue was provided per table. The Boil Bar also has a partnership with Presotea, so you can get your bubble tea fix here as well! Though, the menu is very limited.  Menu is fairly simple: pick your seafood, then pick your flavoured sauce and lastly, spice level. They also had options of sizzling plate, which could come with a side of boiled seafood. Sides of corn, fries, onion rings, edamame (which I find to be a weird combination with boiled seafood), etc. Even other dishes like baked lobster, baked mussels, and seafood fried rice is available!  We went with.... - 1 Mussel - cajun sauce, mild spicy - 1 Crawfish - house sauce, mild spicy - 1 Lobster - garlic sauce, mild spicy We ordered it \"a bit spicy\", but when they printed our order and pasted it on the side of our table, it said \"mild spicy\". We went mild spicy as our \"highest\" level of spice, because I don't want to ruin our meal if we couldn't handle the level of spice.  First that came was the mussels, and they came pretty quick after our order. Slowly after was the crawfish, and the lobster. All of our food came pipping hot, and we had to let it cool down a bit before trying to munch on it.  Sad to say but the mussels were probably my favourite part of the meal - and it shouldn't be the favourite part of the meal since we wanted lobster to be our main dish. Mussels were great because the cajun sauce was really soaked in, and was probably the best sauce in my opinion!  The lobster given only had 2-3 pieces of meat (rest were shells or inedible), which was disappointing for $30. Garlic sauce is typical to me, and is nothing of a unique taste. Crawfish was a slight disappointment for me because I had high hopes about it, seeing people in the USA eating it all the time - it just turned out to be decent and I could barely taste \"house sauce\". Maybe it's the cajun sauce overpowered (??) it since the mussels did come before the other 2 dishes. Our total came up to $74 (tips included) - we didn't even order bubble tea, just the food!  Other cons included: being hard to tear off the tissue off the tissue roll with messy gloves + the sauce soaked through the plastic gloves after the end of the meal + for a place with this eating style, you'd think they'll have more than one washroom. Plus, we went during a down time period.. imagine when it's busy and more people need to use the washroom to wash their hands, etc.  As our first experience doing boiled seafood, we left feeling very unsatisfied because we were pretty hungry when we got there, and for the end bill of $74, we thought we'd have our tummies filled. We didn't order any side dishes because we didn't want to get full eating off fries, because if we did, we'd just go to McDonald's.  The thing is: I have never been to a boiled seafood restaurant before, so I don't know if the norm of going to places like this is to spend a certain amount or if people just order more of the little stuff like shrimps, mussels, clams, fries instead of lobsters and crabs...  After this encounter, it's making me really want to try Captain's Boil to have a comparison with The Boil Bar!!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood. Try everything is Amazing. Fries. Calamari. Delicious baked fish. Amazing vibe and service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from northern China and loves Chinese BBQ, which is BBQ skewers seasoned with various spices with a heavy emphasis on cumin. The BBQ skewers are done with lots of different types of meats like lamb, beef, squid, sausage, giblet, beef tendon, and etc.   So we did not go to the Boil Bar for seafood, instead we went for the Chinese BBQ. My boyfriend really enjoyed and said it reminded him of home, so it definitely has that authentic taste down. When I ate it for the first time I thought the meat was tender and cooked well, I found the spices very strong. We have gone back many times and it is definitely one of our favourite places to eat.   The waitresses were very attentive and the environment was nautical/rustic- very cool!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few of the Captain Boil's locations and when I saw the Boil Bar on Yonge Street, I thought I would check it out and see how they compare.  We went on a Tuesday night and unlike the aforementioned Captain's Boil, there was no wait as there were only two other parties in the restaurant. We went with a pound of shrimp, mussels, and clams, with their signature \"Kraken Sauce\" which is a combination of lemon pepper, Louisiana cajun, and garlic, and at level 2 spiciness. When we got our food, we were surprised at how huge the mussels and shrimp were. The clams and shrimp tasted fine, but the mussels were overcooked and chewy. As for the sauce, it was less saucy in comparison to the Captain's Boil, but it did pack a bit more heat, even at level 2 spiciness. I could definitely feel my lips numbing a bit halfway into the meals. In addition, we got a 1/2 dozen oysters. While it was beautifully plated, it lacked the brine and liquor and was a bit bitter; not sure if this is a testament to the freshness of their oysters.  One thing to note is that the quality of the gloves at the Boil Bar is far superior than that of the Captain's Boil as they have more of a snug fit making it much easier to peel the shrimp. However, if given the choice between the Boil Bar to the Captain's Boil for seafood boil, I think I'm gonna stick with the Captain's Boil as I preferred their sauce and seasonings more."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon and finally made it around to attending. There obviously was a pre fixed menu so we order the dungeonous crab with sausage , shrimp boil, corn, garlic bread and lobster chowder. Everything was good no complaints. The staff was accommodating and friendly. Our bottle of wine wasn't available so they gave us  better quality wine for the same price as the previous one."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon...buyers beware, it's not a good of a deal as you'd think.  It's still cheaper than paying a la carte. I bought for 2 people,  so you get 2 corn, 2 pieces of garlic bread, choice of a) lobster or crab  then b) shrimp, mussels or clams.  I was under the impression it was 1lb each but it's 1 lb of section b) for each pair ie 1 lb for 2 people and 2 lbs I think for 4 people (check cause I didn't verify)...now for section a) you get 1 lobster which is about 1 - 1 1/4lb for each groupon..so if there are 4 of you, you will be sharing just 1 lobster.  I called about the restaurant to ask, hence my warning.    So the price isn't as cheap as you'd think, though the groupon DOES include tax!  so that was a nice bonus. (You can buy the groupon for 2 people or 4 people or 6 people...so the a) section is just 1 crab or lobster no matter the number of people, but the b) section ie shrimp would get 1 lb for 2 people, 2 lbs for 4 people and 3 lbs for 6 people)  Okay so the food...that's important...it's fresh.  We got shrimp and lobster.  I've eaten lots of seafood and I was hesitant about ordering shrimp as I find shrimp today isn't fresh tasting but has a weird taste from the shrimp farms.  These shrimps (have their heads on), but they are very fresh and sweet tasting. (yes hot and served in plastic bags). The lobster came afterwards and was cooked very well and tasty and sweet as well.  The everything sauce (can't remember the name) was quite good.   If you're a big eater, I think you'd be hungry still.   So I'm a fan cause it was good seafood..fresh tasting and worth coming back.  I'd like to try their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Walking in, you're transported onto a old school sail ship. They've put a lot of thought into the decor and the place has a nice vibe. I came here on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was relatively empty, there was really no need for my group to make a reservation.   The servers here deserve a special shoutout because they are fantastic. However, the food here just couldn't match up to the seafood boil I had in   If you're looking for a light low fat meal then you're in the wrong place. I got the Kraken sauce, which tasted like a combination of all the sauces (that are all butter based btw). It was too salty for my liking, but the flavour was good. Minimum order is 1lb for all seafood boils, but you'll definitely want at least 1lb. My friends and I weren't really satisfied from just the seafood, so I also got a side of corn and sweet potato fries.   Make sure you have napkins at the ready. Share your meal on social media and you can save 10% because why not?"}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for seafood? Do you not want to taste the seafood? Boil Bar is your answer, my friend. Wait, that sounds like a negative but here I am, giving 4 stars?? Boil Bar isn't necessarily about showcasing the delicious taste of the sea. Instead, it's about mixing tons of sauce and oils with fresh crustaceans to create something surprisingly and dangerously delicious. Prices range from $10-$30 depending on your seafood of choice.   Oysters ($1.50 each): The evening started with and ended with half a dozen of these beauties. Bf said these were some of the meatiest oysters he's ever had and I gotta agree, they're really good. Also, great price considering what we got.  Shrimp in Lemon Pepper Sauce ($11.95): These were savoury and saucy, but lemon pepper? Other than the presence of a slice of lemon in the bag, I would've never guessed that was the flavour.    Mussels in House Sauce ($11.95): House sauce is a combination of all the sauces. And this was perfect. The mussels were meaty and in my opinion, the perfect instrument to scoop up all that sauce. And that sauce was so good, I had no shame in licking my hands clean.   Bubble Tea: Can't go wrong with Presotea. BUT why was there absolutely no indication of the social media promotion?? I was pretty disappointed to find out AFTER the meal through Yelp that you can get a free bbt for posting a picture on Instagram. Considering each bbt is close to $6, I'd say that's something worth knowing.   Other than that, there was another thing that made the meal a little less than perfect. Early in the evening, one of the servers proclaimed to her group of servers that \"those people don't speak Chinese\", in Chinese. We were at that point, the only table there and we very clearly heard this, and of course, we speak Chinese.   It wasn't with bad intent or anything, but if I hear you talking about me assuming that I don't understand, it makes me very wary of what you have to say. Unless the follow-up sentence is \"Damn, they're so good-looking, that sweatpant game is on point.\", just don't loudly assume. Plus, we're in Markham/Scarborough. Sure, I speak the English good, but what part of my Asian complexion made you think I can't possibly be multilingual?   But I digress. One small bump doesn't equate bad service, and overall, the place was friendly and attentive. Food's good, restaurant is clean, can't really complain. The place also makes eating out of a bag look trendy again and not desperate. Where else could you tear through food in a plastic bag with your bare hands without looking like a crazy homeless person? That's a winner in my book.  (73/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, however, the service definitely needs improving. Three stars for the food, none for the service."}
{"text":"Visited on a weekday.  Restaurant was pretty quiet.   Decided on shrimp and crawfish with medium house sauce.  Flavour was just right.  Super spicy would have been too hot for us.  Shrimp was very goo value.  One can get full on one pound of shrimp.  Crawfish were fun to eat.  Probably 12 to 15 good sized ones to a pound.  Also ordered corn, potatoes with our food.  As expected, food came piping hot!!!  Sweet potato fries were good too. OK value for $4.    Service was efficient and friendly.  Nice to have a place in Scarborough/Markham area without going to Yonge/Finch area.  And no waiting in line.  I actually found the flavour to be better than the ones I tried in New Orleans and Texas.  Very saucy and garlicky.  Not just old bay seasoning.    Only thing is sauce was so good - would have been nice to mop it up with a bowl of white rice!!  We found the concept to be a lot of fun and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This is like Captain's boil.. exactly like captain's boil, but! they take reservations!  Hubby thinks the flavor isn't as good here but I thought it's just different but still delicious (yes comparing to captain's boil again). It's like sea-food boil bars are catching a popularity so everyone wants to open one. the seafoods are fresh too which was awesome! so if the other place (ahem captain's boil i'm looking at you) makes you wait an hour and half and won't take reservations, this place is up the street and just as good!"}
{"text":"Food sticks to hot plate, gets burnt, tastes generally like burnt food throughout, burnt my hand on plate, very unsafe -.-  Cheese udon is very average"}
{"text":"Loving the nautical theme! It's cute without being overly cartoonish and cheesy. Servers were really nice and informative. Food came quickly as well! The amount of food that you get is quite decent - we ordered a lb of mussels, sizzling rice with Cajun sauce and fried chicken and Cajun udon. The total came to a little over $30 and it was just enough to get both of us full. Wish there was more variety though but then again, The Boil Bar is only just starting out. Overall, The Boil Bar is great for groups - customizable options, fast and friendly service, nice ambiance, good prices."}
{"text":"Great deals on the sizzling plates! It comes with a choice of protein, rice and a bag of seafood for less than 10 bucks! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I was there last Friday. The $59 combo was a really good deal. it includes 1.5lb lobster, 1lb shrimp, clam, mussel, 4 baked oyster. Also it come with 4 corns, a bag of sausage, sweet potato fries, calamari. I give it a five star, i think boil bar is way better than the captain's boil in both taste and value."}
{"text":"I'm first time come here eat the seafood, I order shrimp and  fish. OMG!  THE FOOD IS OVERCOOKED!  Is TERRIBLE FOOD! (??_?)"}
{"text":"Went using the Groupon special and got the lobster with cajun sauce, mussels with garlic sauce,  corn x2 and garlic bread x2. We added a cheese shrimp udon, which really filled us up. It had a lot of flavour to it and wasn't bland at all, so it tasted really good, but at the same time really oily. Overall, the meal was better than what we had expected walking in"}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night, wasn't busy so was seated and served right away. Restaurant was clean and modern and as others have mentioned, included a PresoTea.   Boyfriend and I ordered:  - 1lb mussles, house sauce, mild  - 6 raw oysters (@ $1.50 each when you order half dozen or more)  - Chicken skillet plate (which came w/ some rice, a few pieces of fried chicken bites on a hot plate and a variety of things like corn on the cob, shrimp, and sausage that came boiled separately)  - side order of fries (tastes like Costco fries!!)  - $0.99 BEER!   Pros:  - we enjoyed the experience & its nice to have a place like this in Scarborough  - oysters were fresh & good price  - mussels were large & fresh  Cons: - even the mild house sauce was PRETTY spicy, I was chugging that $0.99 beer right away so beware!  - there was a social media promo going on that we were not told about... my friend went 2 days later and was told that if you post a picture of the food on social media, you would get a free large bubble tea and I was not offered that at all...   Final Verdict:  I'll definitely come back for some more seafood when I'm in the mood for it and the $0.99 beer will keep me coming back :P"}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner Monday night, decent amount of people eating but not packed (which was great for me). Ordered the shrimp, clams, and snow crab with the house sauce super spicy. I personally didn't find the sauce spicy but it has enough of a kick to satisfy me. The sauce was very tasty. Sweet potato fries were good but was served with ketchup which was meh, I prefer a mayo or creamier sauce but not a big deal.  Lots of sides to try which look good and have sizzling plate options as well that I saw other eating which looked and smelled good. Has a presotea inside which is nice, milk bubble tea was just what I needed after all the seafood ! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here today after buying a Groupon for it. I didn't take the best pictures but I really enjoyed it. I like how you can order via their iPad menus and how they served the food in the bags. We had shrimp in garlic sauce which seemed to be never ending in the bag, we also had lobster with mushrooms in their signature sauce. Corn on the cob and garlic bread also came on the side. I would definitely go back.   A few minuses - water should be naturally served. Especially with all of that food. There should be a heads up as to how hot the food is when it comes. It literally was piping hot. A bucket of some sort should be provided to throw the shells in. We had to deshell the shrimp and ended up using the bowl from our clam chowder order we made. Finally, my Caesar drink had no rim. :( I love Caesars but without a rim, it just seems wrong. Be ready to get messy if you come here...no complaints about that. It was a fun experience."}
{"text":"I was intrigued to try this new seafood restaurant because I had been to the Captain's Boil many times and really enjoyed their dining  style. The Boil Bar's menu also featured more variety of side foods, including some of Asian origin which the Captain's Boil does not have. My boyfriend and I ordered 1lb of mussels, 1lb of shrimp, the sausages and the lobster tail (all in their signature kraken sauce at the explode spicyness level). We also got fries, octopus balls and calamari on the side.   I'm sad to say their sauce did not come close to tasting as delicious as Captain's Boils, and I was truly disappointed. At their competitor's restaurant, their house sauce is an appetizing red colour and you can taste the lemon, garlic and Cajun in every bite. However the Boil Bar's house sauce was a dull brown colour, and honestly tasted a bit bland. Furthermore, the \"explode\" level (which the server told me was medium) was so spicy my mouth started to get numb. The lobster tail was a little over done and extremely chewy, whereas their fries were a little under done and very soft. As my boyfriend and I barely touched the fries and did not enjoy them, we asked to have it removed from our bill. The waitress said no because \"we were just full and couldn't finish them\", not because they came out soft and soggy. Needless to say, I will not be back and I regret spending $83 here instead of at the Captain's Boil."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon deal my friend had.  It's another joint in the whole boil in a bag your seafood kinda deal.  Located on Queen W I believe it's relatively new - it's clean inside and the service is friendly.   The Groupon deal allowed us to have a lb of shrimp, clams, mussels , lobster.  You get to choose the sauces and heat level for each.  It comes with corn as well.    We were 6 people and I think we weren't full - so maybe with the Groupon deal 4 people would have been good to be satiated.  Or if you are just curious and want a little taste then 6 people is fine.  The sauces and heat level were good - the mild actually had a nice kick to it so that was good that it wasn't bland."}
{"text":"I found out that this restaurant was opening today from the Facebook page for their Yonge Street restaurant. Since I had not been in this part of Toronto in about twenty years, I decided to try it. As an aside, I noticed a lot of sushi joints in the area but no seafood restaurants. I did shed a tear when I passed the former location of the Brunswick House.  On to this Boil Bar. I liked the food slightly better than the food I had at the Yonge Street location and I loved the mural on the exterior wall. Since I had given the other restaurant four stars, I am giving this one five stars. My lunch consisted of lobster chowder, sweet potato fries, sweet corn, sausages in house sauce, baked oysters and baked scallops. I enjoyed everything. Two ladies at another table seemed to be enjoying their lobster.  This restaurant uses I-pad menus. The menu seems to be more extensive than what I remember from their Yonge location.   One other note. Be prepared to eat with your hands. This is not a ritzy white tablecloth restaurant. If you are a neat freak, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Just opened today. I was their third customer. I had their basic lunch of fish fillets on a sizzling platter with shrimps, sausage and mussels boiled in house sauce. I also had a side order of sweet potato fries. No liquor license yet.   I really enjoyed my lunch. It was much better than the lunch I had a few weeks ago at the Captain's Boil. This restaurant should give the Captain a strong run for the money."}
{"text":"This review could be result of this restaurant being newly opened but it is definitely going through some growing pains and can benefit from many improvements. Firstly, the beers are not cold. After quite a wait for our beers, they said that they had just put it in the fridge and that it'll be a while before it's cold enough to serve, which when served, were still warm. The food wasn't all that good. We ordered the crawfish and while the Cajun sauce is flavourful, the meat and head of the crawfish was bland and did not have any juice to suck out of. The shrimp were good but again, the flavours did not get past the shell. Snow crab legs were unevenly cooked (some of it was hot but other parts felt like it just came out of the fridge) and no tools were provided to help crack the shell. Baked scallops were heavily doused with mayonnaise. Raw oysters were the best part of our meal. All in all, we were not impressed. If you are thinking of trying this place, I suggest waiting a few months for it to iron out its kinks."}
{"text":"The Boil Bar, Toronto's second seafood boil restaurant, takes pride in providing the freshest seafood which they bring in every day to ensure that their customers have the best dining experience with great quality seafood. They offer eight kinds of shellfish and five tasty sauces to choose from with different levels of spiciness. Not only do they serve seafood boil, they have a wide variety of other delicious items including fresh oysters, baked seafood, sizzling hot plates and more.  Dishes we tried: Oysters, seafood boil (crawfish, mussels, king crab leg and clams), baked lobster, sizzling chicken plate and grilled sweet corn for dessert.  Highlights:  The crawfish was cooked in a delicious Cajun sauce and the flavours from the seasonings went perfectly with the crawfish. Since the batch of crawfish was very fresh, the meat tasted a bit bland because it didn't have time to absorb the sauce. When we ordered a second batch, the crawfish soaked up all the sauce and was perfect, probably because it sat in the sauce for a while.  The mussels were huge and the garlic sauce was perfection - one of my favourite sauces out of the bunch. I loved how the garlic wasn't overpowering because it was light and the flavours blended nicely with the mussels.  For the king crab leg, it was a bit difficult to crack open the shell and it would have been nice to have scissors, but once we got passed that we were able to enjoy the huge piece of crab meat! The meat was succulent and tasted great with the lemon pepper sauce.  The baked lobster had a creamy mayo sauce and cheese on top which I loved! The lobster meat tasted very fresh and went really well with the toppings.   Overall, I had a great experience trying a seafood boil at The Boil Bar and I personally felt that it exceeded my expectations. Compared to the South, The Boil Bar has more of an Asian flare with some of the spices that they use and certain menu items such as the sizzling plates. I would highly recommend this restaurant to those looking to try a seafood boil because you're guaranteed the freshest seafood daily and they have a wide variety of different menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"So I was super excited to see the signs going up for this place because despite the fact it's the AYCE Japanese food mecca, there is not a single 'seafood' only restaurant nearby.   Not only are they open, but they're giving out free samples out front - alas, no seafood, but broccoli and I think some sliced sausages. It's 20% off until Sunday, so extra bonus!  The decor is good, comfortable without feeling too cheap-y, lights are neat, benches nice. My only complaint is that the chairs are super uncomfortable - hard (need cushions) and a bit low, so a cushion would help raise the guest (and I'm pretty tall, so it'd likely be a bigger problem for someone shorter than me). Otherwise, one extra sign for the bathroom (you go through the door next to the sink, then through another door, across an interesting hallway, and then through another door (don't let your kids go to the washroom alone - unless you want to send out a search party). But it's worth it when you open the door and see the cool entrances for both the men's and women's washrooms as well as the super cool, lit up shell fish under glass (laid into the floor). Also the door to each bathroom is like a captain's steering wheel on a boat (you know what I mean)! The sink is a cool copper sink sitting on a wooden barrel. Very fun washroom!  Anyway, back to the food. You are given plastic bibs and gloves and the food arrives steamed (with whichever seasonings you'd ordered on it) in a clear plastic bag. Think \"Shellfish Viking\"! We ordered the \"Combo\" which comes with half a pound of shrimp, half a pound of mussels and half a pound of clams. We also ordered the seafood rice, and fries. My favourite flavouring is the Kraken Sauce (which is their signature sauce). I don't like the lemon garlic as I feel I can taste citric acid, but my friend liked it just fine. The mixed seafood rice was okay, but super bland. Our (very helpful and bubbly) server had mentioned that putting the extra sauce from the bag onto it would help. It did, but I'd like to get it with some spices/less bland next time for sure. The fries (and I'm not a big french fry person) were really really good (I know). Didn't have enough room for more, but will definitely be back (probably tomorrow).  It's fun to order using the Ipad, so it's easy to see what you're ordering and the total price beforehand, which is a bonus.   Everyone who works here is friendly, helpful and efficient. I can happily feed my shellfish habit here and expect to do so a lot in the future!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is terrible! Exact copy of Captain's boil! From style to menu items! We ordered shrimp in lemon pepper and crab legs in house sauce. All very oily and a ton of curry spice, crab legs were small and portion size was unacceptable, the shrimp was a size smaller than Captain's boil and didn't have flavour, as if they poured the sauce on at the very end.  Service was non existent, we had to wave down the server even though at 3pm there were only 2 other tables. Water was pre poured and sitting out in room temperature, and half full. It's probably because they want to encourage people to order from Presotea within the restaurant.  I don't recommend eating here - go to Captain's Boil instead."}
{"text":"This is a newly addition to the present boil seafood affairs in the GTA. A lot of people say this place is a rip off or copy of Captain's Boil but to be fair Captain's Boil did not grandfathered this unique cooking idea, they too copied the idea from our southern neighbour.   My friends and I visited Boiling Bar on a Saturday night for dinner and this place is quite full already by 7. We waited about 30 mins before getting a table. Having been to Captain's Boil and others in the states I already had an idea on what to order to get the best bang of our bucks. We immediately inquired about the availability of the crawfish and disappointingly told it was \"sold out\".   Our group end up settling with ordering 2 pounds each of the clams, mussels, and shrimps, and 1 pound of the snow crab legs. The seafood are what you could expect  - mussels and shrimps were decent n somewhat fresh - Snow crab legs were SO salty.  it felt like they were soaked in salt water or something.  - Clams ... be warn! the clams had WAY more shells than meat. it was such a mission to dig out the clam meat among the shells.  We tried all of flavours and various spice levels; imho none of the flavours really stood out, maybe the house sauce since it has a curry kick to it and at one chilli its quite hot already.  Mostly not returning unless I want to pay to eat clam shells."}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant which is similar concept to (The Captain's Boil). Shared with Presto Tea so you can get your bubble tea fix here if you want.  Grand opening special is free bubble tea of your choice.   I found the menu difficult to follow at first but once the waitress explained it was pretty simple. You choose a main for the seafood. Then you choose the sauce and the level of spiciness. We went with a whole lobster as our main $28.95 (I think), house sauce and mild spiciness. For this price you also get sides which consisted of a few mussels, shrimps, Chinese sausage and corn on the cob. When you order this option there is no plates or utensils. Just paper towels which we used as a form of plate and the plastic gloves and bib. The food is served in a clear plastic bag where the seafood was boiled in with the sauce. Overall, this dish was pretty good. The lobster a bit on the small side and probably about 2lbs. The house sauce tasted really good. Really messy eating but fun at the same time.  The 2nd part of the menu was for grilled meat and is a similar concept to Aka Teppan.  We went for grilled chicken and I think it was $13.95. Its basically a bowl of rice on a hot plate with the grilled chicken sread around the rice and they give you this sauce to poor all over the meat and rice. Tasted okay and when dipping the chicken meat into the house sauce for the lobster it tasted even better.   Considering it was only their second day open and the restaurant being quite busy the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Got food poison after dining here on Feb 14. Toronto Health gave them a conditional pass on Feb 13. which the sign was not posted with that condition at the time! My SO and I both got sick and missed several days of work. I will never return to this place!  http://www.toronto.ca/health/dinesafe/index.htm?show=detail&id=140464"}
{"text":"Tried this new seafood joint tonight. Got a Groupon which was a pretty good deal. Our coupon came with two pieces of corn, two slices garlic toast, one lobster with signature sauce, and one lb mussels with mild Cajun sauce.   The ordering menu is pretty cool, uses an iPad for you to pick your food with pictures. Also get a free drink if you check in on Yelp! You can review the order before you submit.  The corn was buttery and delicious! Wish the pieces were bigger. It's a bit smaller than half a corn. The garlic toast was flavourful and just right. The mussels were half shell kind with green shells. They were pretty big but I prefer the black shelled mussels. Cajun sauce was pretty good, lots of garlic flavour. Lobster wasn't my favorite... quite stringy and the signature sauce has no flavour.   Overall this place is decent if you like seafood especially if you get a good deal like the Groupon. Service was fine. We did get charged incorrectly but they quickly changed it after we pointed it out. Would need to try more menu items next time to see how the other seafoods taste"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a long time!! We had the shrimp in their signature sauce, lobster in butter, shrimp mac and cheese, and baked scallops with cheese.   First of all, the manager owner was on his phone the whole time, looked unprofessional.   Secondly, their signature sauce was so bland and the shrimp was way overcooked. Seemed like it was cooked shrimp tossed in the sauce and served lukewarm. Same for the lobster! Couldn't even taste the butter! The scallops were the size of a penny and drowning in a creamy cheese sauce. Yucky flavour! The shrimp Mac and cheese was ok but way too much garlic in there.   Thirdly, We had the $40 groupon for two and ended up paying an extra $50 for the extras and two Sapporo beers. Over priced for crappy food!   DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"The Boil Bar is essentially a rip off of Captain's Boil, though if you're not willing to travel all the way to Yonge Street and fight for a table, this place gives you a decent taste of experience you would have in Captain's Boil.  I came here on a Saturday night with my family, and to my surprise the place wasn't busy at all. The tables and decorations were very similar to Captain's Boil. The menu was also similar, although this place offers Presotea, more appetizer options, and other dishes that aren't your boil options.  I went with a pound of snow crab leg, lobster, two pounds of shrimp, and three pounds of clam, with sauces ranging from cajun sauce to house sauce (mix of all sauces) to garlic sauce as well. I found the clams and shrimp to be on par with Captain's Boil, but the lobster and snow crab leg to be disappointing. The portions didn't seem to be 1lb each at all, and the lobster and crab lacked meat. It definitely wasn't worth the amount for both unfortunately. The sauces were overall good, with the garlic sauce being the best of the bunch.  Service was disorganized, as my waitress had to return frequently to make sure she took down the current order...and yet she still mixed up a couple of my orders.  I don't see myself returning here, as I firmly believe Captain's Boil is better for this kind of experience...although this place is much closer to my home. Maybe...just maybe."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon (for four) and there was an additional 20% off that day on Groupon so I paid only 42$ for one lobster, one piece of corn per person, one garlic bread per person and two bags of a pound each (shrimp and mussels).   Service was great and friendly.   Now the food does not deserve more than 3 stars. The lobster was tiny, I doubt it was even one pound. The sauce was okay (mix of all sauces, medium) but nothing like the sauce you would find at boiling crab in Los Angeles, which is where I discovered that type of food. It was a little bit bland.   I would suggest going to the Boil Bar only if you have a Groupon."}
{"text":"I've tried this location twice and it's good if you're into eating out of plastic bags with your hands while wearing plastic gloves and a bib. Their sizzling plates are a pretty good deal plus you still get a sampler bag of seafood boil. The best part about visiting now is their 15% grand opening discount. Also, check in on Yelp and get a free bottle of pop."}
{"text":"Disappointed - after seeing all the good reviews, I decided to come here for lunch (and I'm surprised this place has so many good reviews). I was quite confused with the outside since its half The Boil Bar and half Chinese noodle restaurant. However, the decor inside was cute with setup of traps and lobster cages as a separator for the two sections.  It was a Sunday afternoon and this place was nearly empty. For two people, we ordered: 1 pound mussels in lemon pepper sauce, 1 pound shrimps in house sauce and 1 pound crawfish in Cajun sauce.   From the three, the best was the mussels. I was very disappointed in the shrimps at $12.95/pound. It was over boiled since the shrimps were no longer chewy, almost mush texture. And the crawfish at $19.95/pound was even worse with the same mush like texture and a refrigerated after taste to it. For a restaurant specializing in seafood, this place needs work.  The server didn't prepare our table. It's a given that we had to get our hands dirty and I had to ask for gloves and a paper roll...   All in all, would I return? No, better luck at other seafood joints."}
{"text":"Ordered 2x Sizzling Plates.  Plate 1: \"jumbo\" shrimp with udon, garlic sauce Plate 2: fish fillets with fried rice, lemon pepper sauce  Pros: - great value - good shrimp from the bag - flavourful, crisp corn  Cons: - \"jumbo\" shrimp were tiny and completely tasteless compared to the \"bagged shrimp x2\". Must have been frozen for over a year because it tasted like fleshy water. Just... the worst seafood I've had in my life. - garlic sauce had a horrid aftertaste, almost like a chemical - fish fillet was actually fried fish sticks, with an overabundance of batter. 1/3 of the fish was just me eating hollow batter - rice was clumped together - sausage was way too salty   I will consider trying again but with a vastly different order, because this was a swing and complete miss."}
{"text":"I am a huge seafood fan, so I had to try this place.  I had heard that Captain's boil wasn't any good by a few friends, but  took a chance that this one is better.   I took my girlfriend and we both really enjoyed it.    We had the Dungeness crab with garlic sauce spicy and two pounds of shrimp in the cajun sauce.  Both were excellent.  The shrimp were quite large which makes it worth the effort.  The crab was a bit on the small side, more like a medium sized crab.   Prices were good.  We will be coming back soon.    Service was good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The concept of seafood boil is to get messy, no utensils are provided.. So I don't understand why everyone is complaining that this place is messy lol.   *The restaurant actually provided a bucket for seafood shells, thus keeping the table quite clean.  *Seafood are delivered to the restaurant at 3:30PM daily right before opening to ensure maximum freshness *The oyster are from Diana's Seafood.  *Price is a bit cheaper than Captain's Boil, but this isn't something that you can eat every day, more like once in a while with families.  *I prefer Boil Bar more because the flavors are better, more prominent. Captain's Boil was just pure raw garlic sauce... Garlic breath alert!!   -Mussel with sweet corn and sausage (Garlic Sauce - a bit spicy) I love how the garlic sauce wasn't overpowering with just a hint of heat - complimented perfectly with the well-cooked mussels!  -Clams with sweet corn and sausage (house sauce - mild spicy) These were a bit annoying to eat at times as I would get empty shells at times and have to dig through the bag for those tiny clams. Otherwise, the house sauce was flavorful but it was spicier than what I expected! I'm not too sure what kind of spices they used here, but there was a hint of cumin that lingered at the back of my throat.   -Craw fish with sweet corn and sausage (cajun sauce - mild spicy) Anyhow, to eat crawfish, after you peel the tail you must try sucking the head! It's not gross at all, you are simply tasting the juice from the boil combined with some of the fat from the crawfish. The crawfish was cooked well they were able to soak up that delicious cajun sauce.  -Baked Lobster There was a thick layer of creamy cheese and mayonnaise on top of a perfectly cooked lobster. I love that they pre-cracked the claw, so I didn't have to struggle so much to grab those sweet lobster meat out of the claws ;). I think it would have been even better if they sprinkled panko on top for some texture though. I noticed that other than the claw meat, there wasn't much lobster meat anywhere else so do take note of that.  -King crab leg with sweet corn and sausage (lemon pepper sauce) I didn't find the lemon pepper sauce to be spicy and the pepper was almost nonexistent. They gave us extra lemon to add more flavor but I felt it wasn't needed. I like that the sauce was light and enhanced the natural sweetness of the crab meat.   -Sizzling chicken plate (Similar to Aka teppan) The portion here was smaller and I found that the meat - in this case chicken - was already cooked and the hot plate was there just to warm up the food. Nonetheless, I liked that the chicken had a light breading and the skin crisped up from the heat, while still maintained moisture on the inside.  -Grilled Sweet Corn Similar to MeNami. But this one was softer and not as crunchy as Menami."}
{"text":"I am a seafood lover but I was alittle underwhelmed with the flavours at this place. Firstly, it's a nice location along Yonge and Bloor. It was not too busy on a Saturday afternoon. There is the Captain's Boil down the street from this place which makes competition tough. I think service was overall slow given that the restaurant was not busy. You are given plastic gloves, plastic knife, spoon and forks as well as plastic bibs for juices that might spill. Wear those bibs as you are bound to get juices on your clothes. You place your order over an iPad which a server collects and answers any questions you may have. It's a step process so you order seafood followed by corn and spice level.   We ordered spicy shrimp but it was not spicy at all, not even in the least. The garlic shrimp and spicy shrimp both tasted the same; presentation is in plastic bags. The shrimp comes with their head and tails intact so be prepared to get close to your seafood. The rice was served on a plate instead. The corn also tasted bland. The rice had green onions, eggs and imitation crab. The calamari was the star at dinner. The pieces were small which was flavourfully battered. We had to order more as it excelled in comparison to the other items on the menu.   Remember to bring credit card or cash as debit cards are not accepted. I was surprised to see that there was a 10% tip allowed on the bill. I have to give a big shout out to the chef here who agreed to cut my corn off the cob because I cannot eat corn on the cob the traditional way. I wear braces. Thank you chef."}
{"text":"Boil places are apparently the thing right now... My first experience was in Vegas this summer and I enjoyed it so decided to try this place on Yonge St.   I thought at first that they were closed: Thursday night around 9pm, not a single patron inside and an  employee moping the floor by the entrance. She waved us in so on we went...  The service was nice. Better actually than I expected for this sort of casual place. Our server explained the menu options which incorporated an asian twist to the southern seafood offering.  We opted for the sizzle beef plate and shrimp boil. Added corn, sausage and potatoes.  Everything was served very quickly. In fact, I wish they'd taken more time since it felt like the food would have been more flavourful if given the time to really soak in their \"Kracken\" sauce.  With so many options available I don't think I'll be back for dinner but the prices are good enough that I'd certainly do lunch."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon and was seated quickly. The order which the food came out showed that the kitchen is still trying to optimize the processes and flow, they're a new restaurant. We had to remind our server of our orders so that they can check with the kitchen since we got there earlier than other patrons and they were served before us.   Now to the important stuff: I really enjoyed their house sauce at exploding level. If you're into hot peppers this will give you a nice run for your money and bring on some forehead sweat. The corn as sweet and butter which was perfect against the spicy savoury seafood. We got the shrimp and Dungeness. Shrimps are a good size and a good portion for 1lb. Dungeness was a lot of work to eat so we will probably stick with lobster/shrimp/mussels in the future."}
{"text":"Environment is nice, walls and pictures are related to seafood. Excellent service, waitress was very helpful in explaining the concept as that was our first time. Delicious food. We tried the Oysters and the seafood combo. The seafood combo came with udon, mussels, shrimp, crawfish, sausage and corn and we had the house sauce. We had sweet potato fries on the side and bubble tea for drinks. While the food was delicious, i think the portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"It was pretty good and I would be okay with going again. When you walk in there, it smells super garlicky and I felt like it stuck on me for a few days. It was in my mouth, on my fingers, and my farts were extra deadly.  I brought my parents and my brother, and we didn't have reservations so we were seated downstairs away from everyone else, which was great because we get to eat messily without being self-conscious and feel like we were in our own private space. The wait staff came by a few times to check up on us. They were really friendly. You use an iPad to order everything.  My dad works at a Chinatown restaurant and he thought the prices were a lot cheaper than he expected considering the amount of food we received. We ordered the big combo that was about $80, a pitcher of beer, and one order of cajun udon noodles. The combo included: 1lb of shrimp, clams, and mussels; lobster, sausages, sweet potato fries, and calamari.  My dad's a sloppy eater and enjoys whole shrimp with their heads and shells still on, so this was right up his alley! Everyone really enjoyed it. I can't say I really remember which sauces we liked best. My parents thought they were all the same heavy-on-the-garlic sauce. I probably ate too quickly to differentiate them. The food was decent. We weren't super stuffed after our food.  The plastic gloves I was wearing must have been punctured by something because they were wet underneath after I finished eating. I washed my hands many times with soap and the smell was still on my fingers! My tummy felt a little bloaty for a couple days, and again the farts were so noticeably more gross.  All in all, I'd go again, if I feel like splitting a few bags of shrimp with my dad."}
{"text":"Waiting for them to open! It's 12:32pm and were scheduled to open at 12pm. Devon, their waitress has also been waiting with us for them to open. We asked her if the kitchen staff and manager were on their way, and we learned that they had not contacted her with any information re their arrival time. They just left her and their customers waiting in the cold. Been checking Twitter and Facebook for any updates re their delay, and nothing. Very unprofessional! Devon deserves a promotion, and the manager needs training on service and punctuality. At least have the decency to announce any delays.   P.S. the weather is bad, but all restaurants around the Boil Bar have opened on time.  P.S.S. Devon took my number because she did not want my 4 friends and I waiting in the cold. So she suggested we grab a coffee and she would call me when the staff with the key arrived. She just called to tell us the staff had arrived and profusely apologized for the inconvenience. I thanked her but told her we decided to go elsewhere.   ....She was the only positive aspect of the experience."}
{"text":"Portions were small, seafood was overcooked while the potatoes were undercooked. When I ordered an amount they would reduce it by half. Wait times were extremely long. Would not come here for the price."}
{"text":"Who books up a private event on a Saturday night?? We walked all the way down from Bloor all excited about seafood and they are not taking customers.  There should be an update on your website!! Captain Boil, looks like ur getting our business tonight."}
{"text":"Spent $50 on a Groupon. Thankfully didn't pay full price. Traditional combo was two inedible lobsters and that's it. Weren't sure if it was overcooked or bad or a combination so didn't eat it. Threw $50 away. Better than paying full price. Will never revisit."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious.Not only the king crab is good. The mussel, shrimp, clam, and the crawfish was very good. Also their seafood fried rice was really good."}
{"text":"The Boil Bar seems to be another restaurant on a growing list borrowing the Captain's Boil/LA Boil messy cajun seafood style of restaurant service. I'm a big fan of Captain's Boil and LA Boil so naturally this place had my attention as soon as it opened. Frequent visitor's of the previously mentioned establishments will be familiar with the style of service, I ordered mussels and shrimp in their Signature sauce and was shocked to find the sauce had this terrible metallic taste. I'm not sure if it was just a bad batch, but it was extremely unpleasant and I would not recommend anyone go near the Signature sauce. Didn't try the standard Cajun sauce so that could be good, but I haven't had it myself. The seafood itself was surprisingly dry and had no flavour, adding the metallic tasting Signature sauce didn't help things. I also ordered a sizzling rice plate as that sounded quite good but it just tasted like someone had dropped a bag of salt onto the plate.   Looking back on the experience and reading other reviews for this establishment, I'm wondering if I was just unlucky and went on an off night. People seem to be enjoying the place and contrary to most reviews, I experienced pleasant service. Its just the food I ate was one disaster after the next. If I ever go back I will certainly update this review. I can only speak to the dishes I had and if this is a reflection on the rest of their food, then stay away. I get the feeling I was there on an off night in the kitchen, so perhaps give it a shot if your curious. But stay away from that Signature sauce, I've read on here that people like the cajun sauce so I would stick with that if you visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I happened upon The Boil Bar based on a groupon we found online. For $55 it didnt entail much food; we were given 1 lb of clam, 1lb of mussels and 1 lobster. By the end of our meal we were not satiated, and had to wonder off to another restaurant to eat again.   The food itself was great and the staff was very friendly. The service was great, and the food came out very quickly after we submitted our selections. If I ever go again, I would not suggest the groupon deal."}
{"text":"Went here couple days ago I used a groupon which included choice of: lobster or Dungeness crab Shrimp,mussels or clams 2 x corn 2 x garlic bread   After ordering, the first thing to come out was the corn & garlic bread which I find disappointing,I've been to the captains boil and they give a decent sized piece of corn I got 2 tiny pieces also I don't get why they send out the corn and garlic bread first other boils will bring seafood out and then the sides.  We ordered the lobster with side of sausage & 1pd shrimp,the lobster was small I don't think it comes to a pound,the shrimps were good though because they were jumbo shrimp I believe. We also ordered a seafood combo bag which had clams & mussels,the sausage wasn't that good either it's boiled and has a rubbery texture should be fried instead.  Sauces we ordered were cajun mild & the house sauce mild in all the seafood, let me say that the boil bar sauces CANNOT compare to the sauce at the captains boil,the sauce they use here is oily,bland,lacking flavour because all I tasted was some garlic and curry like flavours also I find the sauce in the clams to be really salty they need to work on the sauce flavours cuz cajun at the captains boil actually taste like Cajun suppose to.  Now for service it was ok our servers came handed us the iPad and showed us how to order simple enough,but they didn't offer us any water until I asked for it. Also they seemed confused as we mentioned we used a groupon voucher and asked about a code which I already showed to the 1st server after all the confusion we got our food. We got the lobster after the other seafood came and the server said she would bring us the cracker tool but never got it so I didn't bother asking just ended up using my teeth.  Probably won't come back as I find the food,sauce disappointing,so if you do decide to come here I suggest get the deal from Groupon"}
{"text":"Eating cooked seafood from a plastic bag using your hands has become the latest trend in Toronto's food scenery for a while now. And since it's so hard to get in to The Captain's Boil, I decided to give this one a try.  Among its variety of seafood-inspired dishes, I really liked the King Crab Leg served with the Leviathan Sauce. The crab legs were surprisingly easy to break apart, although crackers or scissors are provided for the tougher shells. For smaller things I recommend the Cuba Shrimp paired with the Kraken Sauce -- their signature garlicky house sauce.    ALSO I strongly recommend you go there during lunch time, and buy the deal from Groupon! You can get one of their sizzling plates. For only around 8 bucks (I think?), you have a choice of beef, chicken, shrimp, which comes with a side of mixed seafood boil bag (2 shrimps, 3 sausages, 2 mussels, and sweet corn). Very decent deal for all you workers and students out there, way better than food court eh?  Overall what I like about The Boil Bar is that there is zero formality. This whole dump-it-on-the-table-and-share gives a lot casual touch on the whole dining experience, and makes eating out together much more fun!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Delicious sauce, fresh food and you get a lot for the value. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Taste: The Kraken sauce was too salty for my liking. However, it was less oily than Captain's Boil's signature sauce.   Freshness: The crayfish and shrimp were not fresh. They were the previously frozen ones. Previously frozen shrimps tend to be mushier, but still acceptable. However, previously frozen crayfish was just dry and tough, not recommended. My fave were the clams, which were very juicy.   Sides: I think there should be more options. Captains Boil offers lotus root and okra. I understand that the Boil Bar may want to distinguish itself from Captains Boil so it does not want to offer the same sides. Maybe the Boil Bar can offer potato slices or some other veggies as sides?  Cost: On par with Captains Boil. The 15% off really sweetened the deal.   Service: Very attentive. Much better than Captains Boil."}
{"text":"I had been wondering about this place since I noticed on their website that it was planned. I finally tried it and love it. It is much better than the insipid Captains Boil chain and is a bit better than the LA Boil in Mississauga.  I recommend the shrimps, mussels and clams in Kraken sauce as well as the raw oysters. Try the sweet potato fries and the sweet corn. The ipad menu is easy to navigate and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6, including two young ones (ages 2 and 4). Let me start off by saying this is definitely a fun place to eat and takes you back to a time before plates, forks and knives which is of course completely foreign to all of us. You are expected to eat with your hands. Throw your shells or food on the table cloth. And everyone had to wear the really funny plastic bibs. We had a groupon for this place. 60 dollars for 6 people. With that deal we got 4 bags of seafood (we had the shrimp, mussels, clams and lobster), spicy fries and  garlic bread.  We also chose their signature sauce for the shrimp and lobster, and their garlic sauce for the clams and mussels. They give you 1 pound per bag of seafood. The sauces were pretty tasty but the lobster was quite chewy and not impressive. The deal also was definitely not enough food for us to leave feeling full and when I looked at the menu to see what it would cost to actually bring a group of 6 here, I definitely would not come back here."}
