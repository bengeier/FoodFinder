{"text":"Tried the jerk chicken shawarma wrap. Jerk flavour was ok, but every couple of bites I would get a big piece of cartilage. So nasty! Gave up and threw about half of the wrap out. Not impressed. So NOT worth the $8 it cost. Much better value, taste and quality in other places."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken and rice and peas in Toronto. I've never gotten the wraps so I wouldn't mess around with that, but the jerk chicken with rice and peas is the best out there. Nice home made jerk chicken, which the woman there chops it up fresh with a butcher knife. Perfect amount of spiciness and char. The rice and peas are always cooked perfectly and for the $6.99 lunch special they give a really good amount of chicken and rice. It also comes with a pop or water bottle. The women that work there are so sweet and nice and are always friendly, I think it's probably a family business or something. If you want to try this place, please do yourself a favour and get the jerk chicken lunch special!!! You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"If the $5.99 lunch special proves to be as awesome as my first sampling of the jerk chicken combo this will be my go to place in North York for Jamaican food.  Food is outstanding and for a small platter you get a lot!  I had three flavorful pieces dark meat chicken, two cups of rice and kidney beans, and coleslaw served on a huge oval platter.  The meat was tender and the rice was moist and cooked proper.  They are located right beside San Francesco Pizza."}
{"text":"Oxtail has no taste was extremely watery and such a small portion for almost 12 bucks! Their jerk might be good but the oxtail was HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"This is a good lunch spot that I re-discovered today. I went a few years back and found the food decent but not exciting. I had the jerk lunch special today and I found the portion decent and the food very flavourful. I'm a fan of Jamaican cuisine and this is one of the very few decent options in the area."}
{"text":"Great food at fair prices($6.99 lunch special). The jerk chicken is some of the best I've had and everything else is consistently good. The staff is very friendly and its a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - the only reason I visited this restaurant was because it had the weirdest fusion of two of my favourite cuisines, Carribean and Mediterranean. (Try finding another restaurant with this concept!)  I had the Jerk Chicken Shawarma during both of my visits. While it was nothing amazing, the combination of flavours was new enough for me to come back for a return visit.   Absolutely no complaints with the food, but don't expect anything special. It's a solid option for a quick meal that will do a particularly good job of piquing your taste buds."}
{"text":"The chicken was very flavourful and most importantly fresh and juicy. Rice and peas was also tasty and delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'm definitely going back to this place."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp because I wanted to eat some jerk chicken. This Caribbean place near my house isn't too good so I decided to find a different place and stumbled upon Wraps & Jerk.   I got the small jerk chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw on the side. Boy did it taste delicious! The jerk chicken had a lot of flavour and the skin was delicious (I love the skin on jerk chicken). Also, the rice and peas was warm and soft, I cleaned my whole styrofoam container. Last but not least, the coleslaw was seriously different than other Caribbean places I've tried. It was nice, sour, flavourful and so darn good! I will come back for more!  One tip is that you should go in the earlier hours to be able to get the good, big and hearty pieces of chicken and also if you want ackee/saltfish, goat or soup. I went about two hours before closing and they only really had jerk and bbq chicken left (which btw, were pretty small pieces)."}
{"text":"I went to Wraps and Jerk for lunch, ordered the lunch special, which consisted of a jerk chicken leg, rice and peas and a drink for $6.99 (picture attached). I also ordered a large chicken soup which consisted of chicken, dumplings and vegetables in a thick broth. The entire order was $15.00. The food quality and taste was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a drive-by - had never seen or heard of this place before. Oh my goodness, SO GOOD. BBQ chicken and oxtail were both super tender; great portions. Hubby wanted to eat the bones! Definitely a repeat when we're in the area."}
