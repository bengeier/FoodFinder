{"text":"An absolute delight. Enjoyed the Drexler and Bibby, both refreshing, tasty and boozy. The Drexler almost tastes like a lighter, gin based manhattan? Really liked it.  The space is light, minimalist and charming. The food was excellent - catfish nuggets, chiccarones (with hot sauce) were a great start and the pork shank and duck confit were delicious. Can't wait to come back.   Pro tip - $1.50 Pacificos during Happy Hour, can't beat it."}
{"text":"I've been here before. Was pretty great. Amazing space. Today, I went for brunch. The menu was super limited be the two items I was interested in was not yet ready. Really disappointed in the bean/quinoa burger, which I could have made better myself. I would recommend for dinner or drinks, but stay away for brunch. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Truly unique dishes that were equally as delicious. Went with a large group, but looking to go back again for date night. Was about $20/person w/o drinks."}
{"text":"There isn't another place in Cleveland like The Plum. It's a beautiful space inside and out. When I come here time just disappears because I never want to leave. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. The cocktail menu has something for everyone. Also, boozy slushies! They change the flavor of the slushy machine regularly. And I mean, come on, who doesn't want a boozy slushy?! They have a great wine/beer selection as well.      The food.... I've had lunch and dinner here. My new favorite sandwich is the apple cured turkey. I was recommended to add bacon to it and boy was I glad I did! Delish! As for dinner I've tried everything but the whole fish, simply because I know that's not for me. The creamed spelt is fantastic. It has a really nice texture and subtle lemon flavor. I also recommend sharing the pork shank and beef belly. You won't be disappointed. Everything comes out as its ready. It's nice to go somewhere and be able to try multiple menu items and share with the people you're with. It's not your traditional dining experience and it's really nice to have a place like this in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a near perfect restaurant. The minimal furniture and modern decor creates a really laid back environment. I was worried that I'd find the place to be pretentious or something, but it was really just laid back and nicely simple. Most importantly, the food was excellent. I would recommend looking at their most recently offerings on their instagram or Facebook (maybe a updated menu will be on their website soon?) to get an idea of what could be in store for you. Despite their humble approach to modern food, it's not your typical restaurant whatsoever. No rock'n'roll tacos or grilled cheese gut bombs. When I visited, each lunch menu item seemed pretty unique based on special ingredients, prep methods, and flavor profiles. We shared both salads, a few cocktails, the Vegan Bahn Mi and the bean and rice burger. Clearly, this place is great for vegetarians. The stand out for us was the green bean salad and the burger. I am a meat-eater and was totally sold on the handmade vegetarian burger. I think next time I'd go even heavier on the mustard (which I think was housemade). I look forward to going back and bringing friends from out of town here. It's refreshing to have a cool restaurant without any kind of agenda besides from making good food. It's also awesome to have a place that actually delivers interesting and delicious food for both vegetarians, vegans and meat-eaters in one place."}
{"text":"The food. The service. The design. Everything here is incredible. Wow.   Hear me out: this operation is so out of place. You'd expect this in Los Angeles or San Francisco or perhaps D.C. The beef cheek sandwich is beyond description, and I'm going to make lunch here a standing appointment. You should all aim to stop in so you can nod in agreement."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner at The Plum.  It's a creative new place in Cleveland -- small plates brought out to share, creative menu, and very very pleasant. Amazing meals.  The atmosphere is relaxing and light and we could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from the dining area.  We didn't feel rushed and the owners are there, available, and great guys.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"We had a rocky start due to some confusion with a photo shoot that was setting up there, but the owners saved the day. The owners showing such an effort to make us feel welcome as customers by going the extra mile meant so much and spoke volumes about their work ethic and how they value customer service.   Beautiful inside, airy and open space, cute patio, great happy hour specials, and yummy snacks. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sandwich game . Every time I eat here it's like a culinary safari. Come here for a wild flavor adventure for your mouth."}
{"text":"I walked into this place for an early lunch date with my girlfriend and maaaaaaaannnnnn lemme tell you. The setting and layout is real simple yet wonderful. Nostalgic pin ball machine. Simple art on the walls. Good sized Windows provide wonderful sunlight. Comfortable and decent space to allow conversation. The staff looks straight out of indie movies and they're all so kind. If I were to die. I'd rent a Ferrari, pull it out front and drink myself to death here just cause it reminds me that it's okay to feel cool."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Interesting, creative, delicious. Lovely space as well. Service was a bit slow (I think they forgot a course or accidentally served it to someone else first) but it worked out. I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Plum Cafe & Kitchen was great! We decided to eat family style so we were able to try a lot of different items, and it was all delicious! The servers were all very friendly and helpful answering all of our questions. There was also an extensive beer and cocktail list. Everyone had a great time! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Visited on a whim for dinner and so glad we did! The space is lovely and charming, the food was incredible, and the service was good. We had the roasted cauliflower, buckwheat blinis, and the quinoa puri. Everything was awesome and such a different take on items that could seem ordinary or mainstream. Can't wait to go back for their brunch! Vegan/vegetarian friendly. Great beer, cocktail, and wine selections."}
{"text":"First time. Unique menu. Dishes well presented. Love the vegan items. Service was excellent. We will be back"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed coming here with one of my friends. We decided to visit for Happy Hour and I am sure glad we did. They have 1/2 off ALL bottles of wine during happy hour! They will let you taste the wine first only if they have a bottle of it already open. They also have wine by the glass for $5, a specialty cocktail of the day for $5 and select beers for $2.  We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (which was delicious and crisp) as well as 2 sandwiches from the HH menu. I ordered the coveted Fried Chicken Sandwich while my friend ordered the mini BBQ Mushroom Sandwich. She said her sandwich was so so good and she would order it again. I am now obsessed with this chicken sandwich. I am not even sure what all comes on it but the flavors all work so well together.   I am intrigued by the entire menu and am hoping to visit many more times since it took me this long to discover this great place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's such a cool vibe as soon as you walk in with very bright airy atmosphere & sleek furniture. The staff was super nice and attentive. We came in for an earlier lunch so went straight up to the counter to order and sat at a table. There's many windows and the patio is pretty big and will be awesome when this weather finally warms up for good.   They brought out our order of the Red Beans & Rice burger and the House salad which were both great. We also got the potato salad side. Everything has interesting flavors and I dig it. Definitely not your 'normal' veg burger and house salad at all.   I will definitely be back to this place many times and know they will be starting dinner service soon. I was tempted to get a huge cookie they have available along with other pastries but held myself back. Oh annnnd they serve a small breakfast menu. This place is bound to be a hit in the area!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and delicious menu.  The menu is seasonal and is great with each new change.  A neighborhood gem"}
{"text":"Great place with excellent attentive friendly staff.   Just a glance at their menu let's you see this place is doing its own thing and doing it well.   Every dish out table ordered was great. Putting this place on my list of regular dinner stops.   Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"If I didn't work here, I'd be here all the time. Well, scratch that...I'm here all the time for leisurely purposes. Let's start with the menu. It's downright heavenly. A lot of places these days, especially here in the Midwest, serve you a bunch of mediocre fare in large quantities so you feel satisfied but completely forget the meal afterward. At Plum, Brett and the staff in the kitchen are playing with flavor, textures and conceptions of classic and new dishes, working with under-appreciated cuts of meat/fish, plenty of locally sourced vegetables, and homemade pickles and sauces to tease the palette.   Unpretentious, family style small plates for dinner that are shared and enjoyed, and delicious sandwiches and salads during the day. Lastly, the cocktails are heavenly. I feel underwhelmed by most cocktails out and about, but there isn't one on the menu that I wouldn't enjoy often!   Stop by and visit. On top of the food, the ambiance, patio, music and good vibes will make you swoon."}
{"text":"Drinks good. Apps --- meh.  Ordered the fettuccine appetizer -- supposed to be made with preserved lemon but the lemons were nowhere to be found.  It did include yellow summer squash which married up nicely with its absolute blandness.  Tasted like I just threw leftover veggies in with pasta and the green onion pesto was flavorless. Add to that a 1/2 teaspoon of buttermilk ricotta and 1 drop of chilli oil,  stir to achieve a light green mess and serve. Chickerones were good but billed that the come with 'housemade' hot sauce.  My advice charge $3.00 less and use Frank's Red Hot.  Obviously dinner did not happen.    Current menu is a bust --- may try again after it changes but right now too veg, too Asian for me.  Off to Luxe or Spice Kitchen."}
{"text":"Just got food from here on Uber Eats. Smoked Duck Confit. My appetizer was cancelled due to unavailability. unfortunately the food was way below expectations for $24. The duck was smoked beyond oblivion.... instead of being tender and sumptuous as duck often is, it was very dry and very chewy. The flavor was alright, but overshadowed by the nearly inedible texture. Based on other great reviews, I have to imagine this was a fluke.... I'll give the restaurant another shot someday, but I was utterly disappointed on my first try."}
{"text":"Fantastic overall experience. Creative and unique menu. Wonderful service. Great ambiance. Delicious dishes-specifically the poori was a favorite! Check this place out"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience I've had in a while. Food was 3-4 star, service is a 1 and that's pushing it. We were berated for not having a reservation and then part of a huge to do when we asked to just sit at the bar. Calm down, Plum, you aren't some 3 star Michelin restaurant. If even your bar seats are reserved you need to rethink how \"good\" you are. Then, the bartender could barely say 2 words to us, looked insulted when I asked for more water, and told us an item was out just to sell it to asked favorite patron down the other end of the bar. The bartenders were doing shots with customers, and unless you directly knew them, they were barely making conversation with you. Maybe I'm too old (28) but if you have new people coming wouldn't you work to attempt you be kind to have them come back? This was an experience I don't need to have again."}
{"text":"Visited The Plum on a Saturday morning and it was empty. Il assuming that this is because it's brand new, because honestly, it was a great brunch spot. The interior is super cute - white subway tile, brick, modern mid century-ness.  We sat outside on the back patio, which was quiet and relaxing. Ordered the vegan bahn-mi (interesting use of jackfruit), a prosciutto sandwich, curried cauliflower, and green beans with crispy quinoa. They also serve coffee, even though it wasn't on the menu. Overall the food was solidly delicious. Green beans were the star, for sure.  Great place to grab a quiet brunch on an outdoor patio. My only criticism is that Platform is right next door and their outdoor patio had some competing outdoor speakers. Both were playing great music, so I think they may just have to coordinate."}
{"text":"Good sandwich, slow service (although our server was very nice) Probably won't be back, so many other options."}
{"text":"A hipsters paradises. First I am going to start with the positives. We arrived for our 7:00PM reservation on time and although our table wasn't ready the host was great in keeping us updated as to when our table would be ready. He even clean off a spot at the bar for us to have a drink while we waited. Then restaurant was very eclectic. The staff was very attentive and we had no complaints in regards to service. We ended up getting sat around 7:30PM. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted during our wait and ordered our dinner as soon as we were sat at our table. 45 minutes later our appetizers arrived followed by an additional 30 minutes wait for entrees. The food was great and served hot. We ended up leaving the restaurant over three hours after our initial reservation. I'm not sure if this is typical or if this was a fluke but it wasn't what we had expected. Overall we enjoyed our experience but were a little thrown off on the timing of our dinner. There are only 7-10 tables in the dining room so make reservations if you're planning to come for dinner on the weekend. We enjoyed the chicken sandwich and wings the most. Brussel spouts for $12 were a stretch for the cost but we enjoyed them. Celery root snack was average."}
{"text":"I waited about a month before writing this dinner review because I wanted to see if we would still have the same level of frustration ... we do so here it goes ...  Plum was too hip and trendy and I felt it came off as being full of itself.  The dinner menu was vague and overly complicated - I don't think its asking too much for a well written menu and perhaps it's a strategy to get more customer engagement but it came off as over the top.  Everybody in our group had questions, many more than I have ever experience anywhere else.  Dinner portions were small and the prices high except when the portions were large and then the prices were even higher.  Food quality was good but several ingredients were really rather strange - ground up pine needles for instance are not something I expect in my meal.  I tried to find it today in the current menu but perhaps \"pine\" season is over! (This was NOT my imagination - we all saw it and thought it was rather odd).  I would give Plum 2.5 stars if possible, however that rating is not possible. Maybe if we go back for happy hour - that menu and pricing looks better - I may revisit this review.  We probably won't be back for dinner.  Note that we went out for an after-dinner pizza snack later that evening at Bar Cento.  (highly recommend for late nite dinning) .... on a final note the Plum website does not list what time they close .... it just says \"OPEN   TUE-FRI 4PM-CLOSE    SAT 11AM-CLOSE\".   Very weird."}
{"text":"Blown away by our small plates: beet taco and beer-battered celery root. Impressed by our medium plates: steak sandwich (add the giardineira!) and lamb stroganoff.  Great alcohol and dessert menu also.   Super cool, trendy ambiance. Very well decorated.  Above and beyond customer service. We called on a whim to get a table -- they were booked but told us we could sit at the bar. Then they called us BACK to let us know there had been a cancellation and offered us a table. Wow! Server was good, too.  4/5 because the medium plates paled in comparison to the small plates... Would like to try more small plates next time. Would have liked to have 2 tacos instead of 1 -- that seemed weird. Definitely going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home from a meeting on a Tuesday night. I had looked up \"burgers\" on Yelp & chose this place - being new to the city, I am just randomly trying restaurants/neighborhoods for feel. So - no burgers, FYI.   I wasn't totally excited about the decor or the menu but didn't want to keep looking so I ordered carry out & had a glass of Malbec while I waited. People were nice, time to get my order was reasonable, I liked the art - and when I got home, my opinion went from a 3 to a 4 - excellent steak sandwich and salad, and in  eco-packaging. Normal pricing, generous servings. Has \"5\" potential."}
{"text":"I so admire this place for how adventurous it is, even if it doesn't always wow. There are always vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, and the ones I had were good, even though the proportions were off in each one (mostly too much richness). The winter citrus salad and creamed spelt were my favorites. The space is beautifully designed, and the light is amazing, especially during the daytime."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE The Plum, not only for the amazing food, but also for the incredible atmosphere and friendly staff! I daydream about their spelt dish and have to get it every time I'm there!"}
{"text":"The Plum is old school Cleveland in parts, but new in others:  the wallpaper, the pressed wood accordian counter, the lamps in the main dining room, the pickled eggs, the mixologist, ....  We usually come here on the way home from other places to enjoy a cocktail, because the mixed drinks are so solid, and we often take our out of town friends here to show them what Cleveland can be.  There's craftsmanship in every part:  the food, drinks, and decor are amazing."}
{"text":"This. Place. Rules.     The food was outstanding. Knowledgeable, polite and attentive service without being overkill.   The decor is super cute.   Great cocktail list too. Sat at the bar and loved watching what was going on in the kitchen as we dined.   Prices are higher than I expected but for the quality, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"The decor and patio are so adorable! I ordered one of the specialty cocktails, which was delicious and reasonably priced. The food was beautiful but was sort of lacking. Brussels sprouts could have been crispier and the lobster rangoon had little to no filling. Overall, if I ordered one of the main entrees, I think I would have been much happier. I would still go back, especially to try brunch!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, modern menu unlike anything else in the CLE. I couldn't love The Plum more."}
{"text":"Tried this on a fluke; i entered not knowing what my stomach was in the mood for and left disappointed. The atmosphere is nice, it's pretty modern and white inside, a little bar and some tables. I asked for \"the best thing on the menu\"  and I was given a sandwich (still not sure of the name) and it had Ham, what I'm assuming is prosciutto and kale, some weird caviar looking red sauce, lettuce, tomato...the taste was horrible. Maybe it was the red sauce throwing my taste buds off but I'm upset I wasted $9 on a bad sandwich. They have the vintage soda bottles so the highlight of my meal was the Sprite in the old fashioned bottles...ill try again but definitely will not be getting their so called \"best of\" sandwich again. As for the menu selection, there were maybe 10 sandwiches to choose from, some gorgeous looking salads but definitely not enough variety for me. The staff was nice too!"}
{"text":"This place it the cutest! Super casual, but creative atmosphere and the menu reflects that. They have a bunch of different sodas which was fun to drink at the bar (I never have pop!). I had the pastrami sandwich for lunch. It was super smokey which I think is good to know before going in. I personally like smokey flavor. I would have liked some extra sauce or pickled veg or something to go with it bc it seemed a little dry. The curried potato salad was so great, I am going to try that next time I make some at home! My husband had the ploughman's lunch and my sister had the prosciutto sandwich ( I think this was the most delicious of the three!). Her sandwich reminded me of a really nice Italian farmers lunch. I think the dinner menu looks so great so I can't wait to try that when I come back."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is as good as it gets in Cleveland. The kitchen and bar are not afraid to force the area folk to actually try something different and step outside of the mediocrity that has consumed this city's food scene for so long. The people on Yelp complaining about the menu at this establishment are not deserving of it and quite frankly they are the reason the food scene in Cleveland evolves as slow as it does. Stick to your garbage chocolate/lemon drop martinis and save plum for when you're ready to step out of the 90's and into modern day Cleveland."}
{"text":"I came here in February with my boyfriend (who is a chef) after hearing rave reviews and we were still blown away by the creative menu, delicious food, enthusiastic servers, and cool ambiance.   We ordered the house salad, the beet taco with buttermilk cheese and fermented hot sauce, the lasagnette, and the brussel sprouts with mortadella, curry pickled lemon, and dill yogurt vinaigrette and pistachios, and we finished with Mason's ice cream. Each dish was unlike any version we had previously tried. Each dish was well thought out: each component was delicious on its own and balanced with the others to produce any even tastier complete dish.   Although the servings were small, there was always enough to share between the two of us and we were satisfyingly full at the end of the meal.  Our server was attentive without being overbearing and was very knowledgeable and friendly answering our questions about the menu.   They also have a great selection of beers, wines, and house cocktails."}
{"text":"Ugh love this place  Pours with natural light & very cute & nice staff (men & ladies)  Interior is beautiful and modern. New American food, Brett Sawyer is a mastermind."}
{"text":"Plum is a little hard to describe, as it is a different dining experience than your average joint--in a VERY  good way. They have a somewhat small but fabulous menu (and drink menu.) I stuck with the Rose to drink (I find it's hard to come by at restaurants, by the glass) but my husband and mom ventured out to try to their custom cocktails and they were  pleasantly surprised.   The food options are all extremely unique (again, in a very good way!) You order with sharing in mind and once the food is cooked, it comes right out from the kitchen, so everything all comes in waves. It's kind of nice because  you can gauge how much more you want to order when you are finished with one dish. It's also nice because you get to try a little bit of this and a little bit of that. The only thing is, sometimes you have may have no idea what you are getting is going to taste like because they are seriously different dishes. I want to say we ordered about 5 menu items, including both smaller and larger plates and everything was fantastic!!! You can't be a sissy and go to this place, it requires an open mind and palette. Everything is flavored and cooked to perfection.   I love the atmosphere--it is cute and trendy with a slightly retro vibe. It reminds me of something you would stumble upon in NYC. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good but ive gone 3xs now and I'm always mad at myself for going. The service is simply the worst. If you're not friends with the bartenders, then it makes no sense to go to Plum. They will completely ignore you and treat you as an inconvenience, if they treat you any way at all."}
{"text":"Really interesting food! I think this place has really unique, and surprisingly tasty, flavor combinations. Enjoyed the fried chicken skins, the tomato and tomatillo salad, and the creamed spelt. I was also pretty amazed with the vegan lime yogurt -- hadn't had a vegan yogurt taste so legit. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Loved it so much!! Great menu, beautiful interior, superb service. Genuine smiles and a friendly atmosphere take the edge off the pretension. Food was a tiny bit oily, but still amazing. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Where to begin with this experience. How about I try to summarize it for you. A trendy bistro serving small plates at big city prices treats two first-time guests to a nearly 2+ hour experience with hit and miss execution and lackadaisical service. Now for the deeper dive.  We arrived on a Wednesday sometime around 5:45pm. The restaurant's interior is quite cool with its soaring ceilings, bright natural light, exposed bricks, hardwoods, the whole schmeal. It does feel a little sterile with all the white, but that's just me. There were a few patrons at the bar but that was it. No other diners inside or out. We chose to sit outside on the patio to take advantage of the waning Cleveland summer.  Oh, the patio. It has such promise. It's a nice, cozy little space with wooden tables and a couple of umbrellas for shade.Unfortunately, it's right next to Platform Brewery so we spent the entire night listening to competing soundtracks and breathing in the wafting cigarette smoke. When the hell will places ban smoking on patios. Seriously. There were also a myriad of dead or dying plants and empty flower boxes on the walls that just made me sad. Upkeep, people, upkeep.  Our server was very pleasant and accommodating. She was attentive to our needs - mostly - and stopped back in after each course to see how things were going. She didn't ask us if we had dined there before and didn't really tell us anything about the restaurant or menu, so we were on our own. Water is self service out of a carafe, something I actually don't mind. The drinks are definitely made with a mixologist flair and there's a nice selection of wine, other beverages and bottled beers. No big gripes here.  Speaking of drinks, I was a bit put off by one of them. The La Novata, essentially their take on the sangria, was a bit ridiculous. Served in a highball glass with an icecube that occupied nearly 80% of the volume, it amounted to a shot of wine for $8. I don't mind paying for uppity cocktails, but c'mon, man.  The menu is filled with interesting, playful dishes, all made smallish for sharing (mostly 2-person sizes) along with a couple of larger plates with outrageous price tags. $45 for a beef dish? Nope. It's just ridiculously high given how reasonable everything else is. Anyway, the dishes we had were pretty lo look at and rather tasty with only a few missteps along the way. The main thing here is that if you're looking for something different, you can't go wrong.  Crispy Egg - A delightful deconstruction of classic deviled eggs and my favorite dish of the night. Smoky paprika adds a nice touch and the cubed and fried whites were crispy and flavorful. Not sure how I felt about the salmon roe, but now I can at least say I've had it before. $5  Chickenrones - Fried chicken skins served with a side of hot sauce for dipping. Well, the ones that were crispy were delicious, the ones that were soggy, not so much. I also thought the sauce tasted exactly like Frank's Red Hot. Not a knock, just an observation. $5  Nori Caeser - Well, this was just a small bowl of gussied up Romaine lettuce with a smattering of pickled onions and peanuts. The miso dressing had a pleasant and addictive sweetness to it, but for $8? Guess they made their money on this one.  Roasted Corn - Loose kernels of corn sauteed with shaved onion, what looked like Brussels sprouts leaves, and little cubes of ham. The poached egg in the center was the star here, done to perfection and ooey gooey good. The ham was so damn salty that if you took any more than a couple pieces with a bite they overwhelmed everything else. $10  Dry Aged Ham - A sort of DIY mini sandwich board. Four sorta sweet little rolls (think King's Hawaiian) topped with black sesame seeds, 8 thin slices of ham, lunchmeat style, and a little bowl of pickle relish. There was also a bit of coffee infused butter on the side that just made a strange bedfellow for everything else. $12  So why only three stars? It. Took. For-ev-er. Really, it took about 15 minutes before we got our first plate and then it took another 15-20 minutes between every single dish that was brought out and then another 20 minutes before we were brought our second drinks and we were essentially the only people in the entire restaurant. I'm all for a leisurely, slow dinner, but what am I, European? I can't remember the last time we took more than an hour for a meal from start to finish and here it just dragged on and on and on and...I think you get it. By the time we had paid the check, we were hungry again!  So that's it. There are some bright spots for this little spot - inventive takes on classic dishes, beautifully composed plates, generally affordable - but for a place that'll have you dropping close to $100, there is some tightening up that has to be done. I don't know, maybe we'll come back. When we've got several hours to kill..."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are fantastic.  The ingredients are fresh and the taste is phenomenal.  It's a great addition to the area right next to Platform Brewery."}
{"text":"I Originally came here because I saw pictures of the Decor of this place and thought it was beautiful and wanted to check it out. But after I tried the food I was completely blown away. I had a delicious coffee and sandwich and am now in love with the plum cafe!"}
{"text":"The food was out of this world, knock your socks off good.  A fabulous addition to the Cleveland restaurant scene.  Drinks were creative and delicious too.  Cool space as well.    Stopped back in at the Plum for dinner again tonight and had the food was even better than I remember - beef tartare was excellent, stuff poblano, fried chicken was perfectly cooked and more than enough for two people.  Really love this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this:  My boyfriend posted a check-in on Facebook as soon as we received our entree. His post was \"The best date-night meal we've had the entire summer.\"   The space is super perfect. By that I mean, it's light and airy. It's clean and inviting. We didn't have a reservation and we got sat immediately.  I ordered The Drexler; babe got a gose sour cherry beer. Both drinks were equally delicious.  We split everything thereafter.   We ordered the house salad. If I could rant and rave about a typical house salad - this would be the one I'd go on and on about. The cilantro buttermilk vinaigrette dressing was light and there was just enough mixed evenly on the leaves that you tasted it in every bite. It wasn't heavy and it didn't overpower the other fresh ingredients. My favorite part about the salad was the pickled mustard seeds; I've never had anything like it before. The seeds just popped in your mouth with every bite. It was a fun experience.   We split the catfish nuggets. My handsome fella doesn't like any seafood (I know, it's his only downfall, I promise.) However, the breading was fantastic and he bravely tried the nuggets and then dare I say, enjoyed them because of how awesome the breading was. So, for a non-seafood eater to eat seafood - I'd say The Plum Cafe can easily can consider this a mission accomplished.   We then split the smoked Ohio-raised pork shank. My mouth is watering just thinking about how awesome this piece of meat was. It was flavorful, it melted right off the bone, and it was a huge portion. The carrots were buttery and totally heirloom quality. The only thing we didn't care for was the yogurt sauce for dipping. The entree stands proud on it's own and certainly doesn't need masked by any other sauces/dippings.   Service was fine - no issues here. Everything came out in appropriate time and waters were refilled as needed.   We decided that night that we'll try to go back again in October, when the menu and the weather change so that we are ensured to get offerings and experiences that are entirely different from what we had during this last visit!"}
{"text":"So immensely in love with this place. We walked past Plum Cafe & Kitchen one day on our way to Platform Brewery and made a note to come back to visit after peeking in and seeing how cute it looked inside.  Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 4PM to catch happy hour (everyday 3-6!). It wasn't very busy so we were able to get a seat outside on their patio. I started with a peach puree frozen rose ($6)- it was so delicious! Basically an alcoholic slushie that tasted so good on a hot day. My boyfriend got a pacifico beer ($1.50). For food we tried the chickenrones, catfish nuggets and BLT. All of the dishes were EXCELLENT- only wish that we could have come a little later to try the full dinner menu (they don't start dinner until 5PM).  The decor inside was super clean, spacious, uniquely decorated.  Will definitely be back to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"Flavorful and fresh!!   We went to Platform Brewing next door, and stopped here for dinner. The small plates are extraordinary-- recommend the flowers and berries and the crispy beef belly.   They have a nice beer selection,  too. (And yes, it includes Platform brews.)"}
{"text":"After having a not so pleasant experience the week before downtown, it was so refreshing to come to a place where the service is mindful of how they are to customers, especially when something goes unplanned. I came in to meet friends and ordered The Mahorn, one of the signature cocktails. Very good. The server then told me about a chicken sandwich special going on, so I decided to give it a try after my friend said how good it was. Unfortunately, the sandwich came with melted American cheese, and I really am not a fan of that cheese. After trying to trick my mind into thinking it was a different cheese, I couldn't take it anymore so I sent the sandwich back... The server was extremely apologetic and friendly about it, telling me how he usually will go over the ingredients of a special when it's not listed on the menu/board but after so many orders he simply forgot. I kept telling him how sorry I was about it, and how much I appreciated his help. I ended up ordering a salad and had another drink, the Sangria Punch (another good selection).  I appreciate the great service, and though it was well worth a review! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Alright, I think this place is 3.5 stars, but since we can't do half stars I am going with 3 until I try it again. Here's my reasoning:  We came in with a group of 5 (supposed to have double, but the cavs parade/rally affected that). Atmosphere is great - modern, trendy, relaxed, clean. The patio had pots of herbs growing out on it which was nice to see, besides who doesn't love a nice patio?! Server was personable and you could tell he tried his best to explain the concept of Plum and describe/recommend the dishes. From my understanding this is a farm to table place that likes to take lesser used (less favorable?) ingredients and put a sophisticated twist on them.   Food - they were out of several things, but we were able to pick from the lunch and dinner menu so we tried a variety of appetizers and entrées.   -Ploughman's Lunch $9: Minus the goopy white part of the egg, this sandwich was simple but pretty good in my opinion. All of the ingredients worked well together.   -Pork Cheek Pastrami Salad $9: I had a bite of this sandwich and didn't think it was too bad, but other's seemed to think the unique taste/texture did not agree with their palate.   -Crispy Confit Chicken Feet $5: This dish was a bit of a  mental challenge for me to get over the fact that I was eating chicken feet. BUT, I'll admit they had good flavor.   -Catfish Nuggets $6 & Yellow Corn Grit Croquettes $8: Feeling indifferent about both of these, not bad at all, but not really rememberable.   -Creamed Spelt $9: I liked this. Crunchy fresh peas, touch of lemon, and a nice cream sauce.  -Smoke Ohio Raised Pork Shank $19: Everyone seemed to like their taste of this dish. The pork and yogurt sauce paired nicely together.   -Homestead Springs Farm-Raised Trout $22: Seems like we had some split opinions on this dish. I personally was not a fan of seeing the entire fish, the green goop under the skin, or the taste, but another diner really enjoyed it.   All in all, I think if you are someone who likes to try new things then I would recommend this place, especially since they change the menu regularly. It's a nice environment and the prices aren't pretentious. The food isn't bad, just a different experience than most are used to probably, but that's what's fun! Step outside your comfort-zone and you might find something new you like (or just confirm you definitely don't like something no matter how fancied up it is)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So beautiful inside and their drinks are awesome! Can't wait for the warmer weather, this is about to be my new favorite patio spot! Not to mention the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in years. We tried one of everything and loved it all! We'll be back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals!  Four of us shared some things and everyone was happy (carnivores and vegans alike).  Our server was very helpful and attentive.  Great cocktails and beer selection too!"}
{"text":"My first visit to The Plum was last summer and I had good time. They had impressive food and drinks. Last week I wanted to check out the happy hour menu and it was really disappointing so we have ordered regular drinks and food at the bar. Bartender was unhappy to serve us but I thought she was just having a bad day. I wanted to give another shot and it was even worse.We have never been asked for another drink, not even eye contact to order more. Only interaction with her was ordering drinks and \"thank you\" while playing the tab. She wasn't happy to serve any of the customers in the bar area."}
{"text":"After a few visits to Plum I can say that this place is legit. It may not be for everyone or for those looking for standard fare. This place is for those looking to break out and try something new. The seasonal menu keeps the experience fresh. It's perfect if you enjoy variety. I've been here for lunch, dinner, on a date, with a large party, and it's been great every time.  Plum is a place where I like to bring out-of-towners or people that were from the area and missed the Cleveland renaissance.  I promised that if the food is not your speed, then the cocktails will surely do you in. ."}
{"text":"Really amazing.  Great feel and unique.  Really good change of pace for Cleveland too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  So impressive the the array and amount of fresh options.  This restaurant is constantly reinventing itself which allows for multiple visits and different experiences.  The staff is genuine and the food is authentic.  Best restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Was very delicious here - great place to try many different plates! I went with a few other friends on the later end of a Friday night - the bar and restaurant were pretty busy but nonetheless the host was able to accommodate our party of 5 quickly. The staff was very attentive and described the sharing concept to us. We ordered the fried brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower, fried bologna carbonara, the pork belly and the fettuccini bolognese and we certainly had enough food! I was impressed that the portion size were enough to actually share and get a good amount of each dish! Usually at sharing restaurants, I find the plates to be small and the price point to be high, so I was happy to see that the portion sizes here were not miniscule. Everything was also super flavorful!   As I live close-by, it makes me super happy that an establishment like this is right in our neighborhood and thriving. With Platform next door as well, it is really livening up the area and I am thankful for that! Will definitely return especially as their menu changes often :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Bloody Mary - best I've ever had! Great food. Be sure to try the brussel sprout salad. Everything was delicious with unique flavors. Good service."}
{"text":"I can't say it any more plainly than this: go here now before this place gets wildly popular and you won't be able to get a table.    I'm not from Cleveland, but take this restaurant and drop it in the East Village in Manhattan or in Williamsburg in Brooklyn and this place would be right at home (think Contra, Wildair, Estela, Luksus, etc). The space is beautiful and they have an awesome back yard. The menu is as relevant as it gets... small plates, delicious things done with vegetables, and redefining lesser-used cuts of meats with aplomb. The cocktail menu is on point, and yes they make a wonderful old fashioned. Throw in some good music and a management team with years of industry experience and you have all the ingredients for best new restaurant in Cleveland.   Don't miss the chickenrones with homemade hot sauce on the side, the creamed spelt, and the spicy cold fried chicken mousseline. I can't wait to go back and order the rest of the stuff on the menu. I'm sure the menu changes often, but go here, order a ton of food and maybe take yourself out of your comfort zone... You won't regret it.   It's places like this that spearhead change in their respective cities. Be thankful you have this place in your backyard."}
{"text":"My lady and I had a fantastic evening here this summer. The roast pork was awesome and was even able to eat some of the catfish nuggets - and I don't even LIKE fish! They have good beer selection, although there's no light in the cooler(by the hostess stand) which makes it look like it's broken. Good cocktails, great food, welcoming ambiance. It's a great addition to Cleveland and it's reputation and praise are well earned. My only complaint is that the high ceiling and hard surfaces make the dining area loud when it's full."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great cocktails & food that you won't find anywhere else in Cleveland. An intimate setting that's great for a date night or a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"I don't know if my tastes aren't eclectic enough, or this place is just too many fancy ingredients piled into one, but it just didn't do it for me. Me and two girlfriends came in and shared the Cheryl drink which to me sadly tasted like Robitussin with ice in it. I also had a beet taco and the house salad, I think. I'm not sure. It just was not very good, unfortunately. I gave 3 stars bc it's so cute inside, like Instagram worthy decor. Just not my kind of place for a meal and drinks I guess!"}
{"text":"Sampled the food menu and was immensely gratified by both the pickled farm egg and the potato&apple. While the pickled egg was only moderately spiced (buoyant egg in brine this was not), it was of an exceptionally palatable consistency. The sprig of dill lovingly layered atop it took the dish (simply an egg in a cup) to the next level. The p&a, however, stole the show. The flavor profile was so distinct and comprehensive as to truly astound: who would have thunk kale, jalapeño, and apple would blend so well together? The result is a shimmering, crisp, savory affair. Small but irresistible. You won't be disappointed with The Plum's vegetarian foodstuffs. That I can guarantee."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Tasty small plates and an interesting space. Neighborhood vibes.  FULL STORY:  Met a group for drinks and snacks.  It was nearly empty from 7 - 10 on a weeknight (too bad - it's a cool place).  I like the dining room other than the echo-ey sound - would get loud with more people.  I liked the funky little flower arrangements.    Food was seasoned well and a little more creative than the Cleveland average.  Our group tried the brussels sprouts (careful -- default version includes meat), beet taco (interesting!  a flat homemade pasta-beet mix wrapper with spicy-citrusy beets in different preparations), and salad among others.  They could definitely increase the veggie options available...  \"Small\" plates are quite small.  I think a \"small\" plus a \"medium\" plate would be plenty for dinner.   Drinks were good.  We tried different cocktails and all enjoyed them - especially the bourbon-based ones.  Small gripe is that most cocktails included orange in some form (campari, aperol, orange \"essence\", peel etc).  I like it, but if you don't,  you're limited to like 1 or 2 options (and those have lemon).    Service was cool and friendly.  Only issue was they were too efficient with clearing things -- took away our drinks before they were done.   Note: street (metered) parking"}
{"text":"I've always loved the food and cocktails here but when I took my family during Thanksgiving weekend, a group of fine and adventurous eaters, and got their feedback, Plum's 5 stars was well-deserved. We ate practically 3/4 of the autumn 2016 menu, from chicken feet to escargot to the roasted cauliflower to cleveland cassoulet, each dish was visually beautiful and executed perfectly. Plus, my opinionated mother loved the decor and the service. For a unique modern american (with french technique) while still very reasonable to the wallet experience, come to Plum. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was perfect! Fried chicken was off the hook-perfectly cooked and sweet and crispy! Beef tar tar was indescribably great! The ceviche was sooo good! The sangria was awesome and had a buttery aftertaste! The fried egg was very interesting and new-great flavor! The beet taco was intriguing and very tasty!  Culinary dream!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little restaurant/bar. Loved the flow of the place and customer service was great! Friendly staff and you can tell they all work well together. The only downfall (for me, personally) was the limited menu. If you are fairly picky then this may not be your diner of choice, but go for a drink at least! Very impressed with beer menu and bar options."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming experience...especially after reading the glowing reviews. I guess their menu changes all the time so maybe we caught a bad one? Who knows...this is a \"do not repeat\" for me.   Food was OK, nothing special. Tiny portions so over order if you're hungry. We just went to another dinner after! $30 for what was essentially a mediocre fish n' chips.   The worst of all was the service. Slow...incredibly slow. We barely saw our server and kept wishing we could switch table so that we could have another server who was clearly doing a better job."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gentle. Jesus.   This place is absolutely fantastic! From the awesome staff to the delicious food! It really makes a difference when the ingredients are organic and fresh, and you can tell they use nothing but the best!  I'm a veggie, and they had several great veg options for me! I went with the creamed spelt and some tomato thing with rice--both were phenomenal. Also got a cocktail with pineapple--could barely taste the alcohol ;-)  For dessert, it was a plate of a variety berries with spicy arugula (who knew that existed) and a yummy vinagrette. Locally sourced, fresh, and original! I mean, who wants ANOTHER molten lava cake?! BO-RING.   Will definitely be making a trip back!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first thought was, I'm not hip enough to eat here. I walked in and heard improvisational jazz competing with a pinball machine The space is very modern and clean and the young people running it made us feel welcome. Maybe we were between services but there were no waiters despite there being seven employees on duty. So we sat at the bar and ordered catfish nuggets, a fancy BLT, and a house salad. All the food was good although a bit salty, including the salad."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my mom. Had the lobster Rangoon which could use more filling and I could've gone without but still good. Then tried the coffee passatelli which was basically an extremely flavorful soup with cylinder dumplings. Finally, for entrees we had the fried chicken sandwich which is the star of their menu and did not disappoint. The general tso whole fried chicken was amazing! It was served with a sesame cabbage slaw that balanced well with the chicken. This dish is enough for 2-4 people. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Attentive service and a creative menu make for a delightful date night! Loved the salads, particularly the watermelon. The whole fish was affordable and delectable."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, I had a phenomenal experience here. First off, they kindly accommodated my large party with a last minute reservation and from the moment we sat down, they provided stellar service to each of us. Their drinks are absolutely delicious and could easily rival those I've had in larger cities such as Chicago or NYC. Food-wise, I highly recommend the chips and dip. I wasn't sure what to expect with whipped octopus and caviar, but I have to say it was surprisingly delicious. Other items I'd recommend are the fish nuggets, beef belly and of course--my favorite--the brussels sprouts.   This was my first time visiting and I will certainly be back. This is a nice place to chill out with some friends and enjoy some great food. Plus, it's right next door to Platform Brewing. So, you can easily pop in next door to cut loose after dinner."}
{"text":"A beautiful little gem. We had bagels and a schmear! The service is friendly and fun. The space is large and beautifully decorated. We sat outside in the garden and enjoyed delicious coffee."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in the city. Would not be out of place in Brooklyn, though prices here are much better! The general tso's whole chicken is the best, though everything we ate was delicious. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place, well designed and great atmosphere!  Honestly had really high expectation coming in. Drinks are good but the food menu is very poorly designed, with most of the items very fatty and fried.  I would definetely come back for a drink, but the food is not worth trying.   Didnt try the desserts but was not in the mood for fried ice cream"}
{"text":"Best food in Cleveland.  Big risk, since Clevelanders might not be open to ordering food that's not on a pretzel bun or soaked in jarred alfredo, but I think we're all hoping this can succeed."}
{"text":"I liked The Plum a lot. The restaurant dining room was full when I walked in at around noon on Saturday, but there were two seats open at the window which is an area served by the bartender.   This place offers a Saturday (and not Sunday) brunch which is great. The menu isn't large. There are fewer than a dozen choices. I tried the Biscuits and Gravy and the Baked Pimento Grits. Both entrees (~$10) were very good, but a little small in terms of serving size. That is unfortunate as there are no appetizers on the brunch menu to order along with the main course.   The Biscuit and Gravy entree was my favorite. The cheese biscuit was a prominent part of the dish and had a great flavor in and of itself. There was just enough gravy to get some on each forkful of biscuit. All the flavors went well together.   The Pimento Grits were good as well. The hollandaise sauce was definitely spicy, but it wasn't too hot. I'm not sure the greens went very well with the other items in the bowl. If I had to choose an entree to order again I'd go with the Biscuits and Gravy.   There was a short, but good sounding cocktail menu as well. I went for an upgraded basic - a peach mimosa which was really good. They also had grapefruit, pineapple and OJ."}
{"text":"My life is forever changed. The atmosphere is absolute perfection. The service was impeccable (and gorgeous). The drinks were so tasty! The House salad was simple and fresh, so good. The brussels sprouts were so interesting and delicious. The fish in brown butter with kale and cream friace was the best thing I have ever put in my mouth and the fettuccine bolongnese was so flavorful and the texture was perfection.  It was a bit loud in there on a Friday night but it didn't distract me from the life altering flavors I was consuming."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner there! The patio was pretty loud due the neighbor restaurant / party but otherwise the ambience was nice. We started with the Frose - I imagined it to be fruity and sweet but turned out it was not sweet enough for me that I had to ask for some simple syrup. Appetizer portions were small but tasty. We ordered the masa cake with cauliflower puree and the beet taco. The masa cake was slightly dry to me but it was great with the generous portion of creme fraiche. The beet taco was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The tortilla was red from the beet, and looked stunning with the golden beet on top. The golden beet was sweet and soft, which paired perfectly with the toasted crunchy tortilla and the creamy sauce which had a kick to it. For entree, we had the whole fried chicken which came with two pieces of legs and thighs each. The chicken meat was so moist and flavorful, topped with crunchy skin that had a sweet glaze to it. Simply to die for.   Overall, the food was creative and presented beautifully on every plate. I would come back."}
{"text":"We came to have a drink and something small and ended up ordering round after round. Food was excellent. Started w/ tomatillo appetizer, then oxtail, then the local green tea ice cream. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Our friendly and efficient server took time to explain menu items and even went to the chef when he was not sure about something.  He also explained that the chef likes to take not widely served cuts of meat and serve them in creative ways.  I see that by the menu that offered several things that I do not find on most restaurant menus like chicken feet and spelt.  The Cleveland Supper Club  ordered an array of appetizers and entrees which allowed me to sample many different dishes.  I went way out of my comfort zone and tried a nibble of fried chicken feet.  Actually was not bad, sort of like a crispy chicken wing. I thought the spelt dish was tasty with the fresh peas.  Did not really care for the yellow corn croquettes, but thought the crispy catfish nuggets were good.  I would probably not order the whole fried trout meal again.  I had a hard time getting past the green stuff under the skin on most of the fish.  The server said it was fish fat, but I have never seen that on the trout I make at home.  I scraped it all off and proceeded to eat my dinner.  The sides dishes were just okay.   The shining star of the food was smoked pork shank dinner served with a yogurt dipping sauce.  The meat was very flavorful and fell off the bone - Yum!  The server was spot on by recommending it.  The vibe of the restaurant is hipster and modern.  Very bright and full of light.  I really liked the patio with the fresh herbs growing everywhere."}
{"text":"Not a very romantic place to eat at the end of nine day trip visiting my lover, but perhaps for the better since there was little room for sadness or moping. However the food made up for it. Highly creative and perfectly cooked. Especially the whole chicken which was juicy and highly flavorable. The wait staff were passionate about each and every item on the menu. It's no wonder that a friend of mine told me it was his fave restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer, this place won't be to everyone's taste. They explain their concept as high end meets low end- they use ingredients that are typically considered \"low end\" such as chicken feet, pork shank, and pickled sides, but use \"high end\" techniques to prepare them. I was very impressed with how patient the server was with us as we asked dozens of questions and hemmed and hawed over what to order. I ended up choosing the fried chicken feet and whole trout. I personally really enjoyed both, I loved how the chicken feet were prepared a little differently than what I am used to- they are deep fried hard so you can eat them whole rather than having to spit out the bones. The trout was also pretty good, although perhaps not up everyone's alley considering it's pan fried whole, so you get all the bones and everything along with it. I could see by what others ordered that there was some definite adventurous options here, it might be hard for the average person to find something that they'd be willing to try. After trying the dishes though, I think we could agree that the flavors worked well, yet at the same time it's not the type of place you'd be rushing to try again. It has to be mentioned that the interior design is absolutely gorgeous. It's rustic while also being clean and modern. It feels very new and renovated, but has amazing detail put into the space to give it that slightly upscale feel. As I said, this isn't the type of cafe I'd be rushing to return to, but I definitely think it's worth a try for the more adventurous eater out there!"}
