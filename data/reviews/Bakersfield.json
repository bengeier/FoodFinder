{"text":"Wow!! I'm not sure I can say enough good things about this place! The Starbucks in our hotel recommended us to try Bakersfield for some tacos and cheap drinks since it was right across the street from where we were staying. We came in for a late dinner on Saturday night and went downstairs to sit at the bar because upstairs was a bit crowded. Our bartender was fantastic, and not only had great knowledge of the menu, also gave us a good lesson on the difference between the types of tequila, because we didn't know about aged tequilas. Our margaritas were delicious, I had the spicy and it was just right on the spice. We ordered the guacamole after he said it's made fresh, and it was delicious! This might have been the best guacamole I've ever had. We ordered 2 tacos each, all were great. My hubby got a pork belly and the only thing he mentioned was a little bit of extra liquid on the taco which made the tortilla just a bit soggy.. Will be moving to Pittsburgh soon and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down Bakersfield has the best guac in the city. Their queso and drinks are also really good. Past this their food In my opinion isn't good enough. Get a salad or a sandwich style dinner here but don't waste your time with the tacos. They're really unimpressive"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and service, food is great and there's a wonderful selection of drinks and well priced tex mex food. Will definitely come again, especially love the open air concept with the garage door and windows!"}
{"text":"wow this place is a total gem! my husband and I randomly stopped here after landing in Charlotte. We were craving tacos and this place definitely delivered. George, our bartender, was awesome. welcoming and gave excellent recommendations. the chorizo jalapeno queso was incredible. so flavorful and just fantastic. It was the beginning of our honeymoon so george gave us a double shot of tequila on the house which was really fun. please do yourself a favor and get the tacos. we got the fish taco (ended up getting two because they were AH-MAZING),  short rib, baja shrimp, and al pastor. the meat in each were well seasoned and so tender. Highlyg recommend the short rib and the fish taco. some of the best we've ever had.  we left super full and happy. thanks!"}
{"text":"Loved selecciones de la casa for a large group and the spicy margarita!"}
{"text":"Always, always good! The tacos are delicious and there is a nice variety. The service is always quick and friendly and the food comes out FAST!! Fast delicious food in this city seems almost impossible but Bakersfield does it! Drinks are delicious and strong. My only complaint is that it's small, so it's always packed."}
{"text":"I relocated to Western PA from Houston/Austin, TX and I have finally found a taco place that makes tacos as good as all the hole in the wall places I took for granted while I lived in the Lone Star state. I had the pork belly taco and the short rib taco both with queso fresco and avocado. The chips and tortillas taste like they are freshly made and the ingredients are divine. They offered me a drink while I was waiting and I had a delicious lemonade. Best service and food I've had in a long time!  I travel to Pittsburgh for work frequently and will dine here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I was I initially apprehensive because it was so busy, but it was easily one of my best experiences downtown. We were in the basement with our server Cydnie and she made some incredible recommendations. We ended up deciding on the short rib tostada and fish tacos and we couldn't have been happier. Although it was busy, we felt like we had her attention. Definitely our new favorite for date night!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since they opened, and I can honestly say that the place has won me over for good.  The staff is amazing, no matter how busy they are everyone makes a point to make you feel welcome.  Each time that I have been in a manager has made a point to stop by and check up on me and make sure everything is to my liking. They have an outstanding bourbon and tequila list that would rival just about anyone.  The food is top notch as well, I've tried several different tacos as well both types of the tortas (they are like a paninis) and am always beyond satisfied. The thing I like most about this place is that it's not like a lot of places downtown that is geared towards a certain type of crowd, this place to me is for everyone, which is something that is refreshing and that most definitely needed dowtown.  5 stars all the way in my book, keep up the outstanding work on all fronts, I will most certainly be back again and again."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. The guac and chips are fresh and very good... the Huitlacoche tacos are delicious! We always get a seat at the bar and have a great time. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was in for an early dinner last week.  Food was great.  Service was good and price was reasonable.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Found Bakersfield after Steelers game. Best margaritas ever. Everything homemade. Manager is friendly and mingled with the patrons to make sure everything was to their satisfaction!  Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Will definitely be back soon. Give it a try. You'll have a wonderful time!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, everything ordered was spot on.  Same cannot be said of service at the bar.  Bartenders were absolutely terrible, bad attitude, zero ambition to create a fun atmosphere.  It might be difficult to hear customers from behind the bar, but these guys were not even lending an ear, totally dismissive and rude.  Makes me sad cause food was really yum yum.  Cheers to USA soccer, which is very local when no local sports are playing especially when the game is being played in CLEVELAND?!"}
{"text":"So good!! Great service and very accommodating. I got the hongos taco and the huitlacoche taco, made vegan and they were fantastic! Full a flavor and fairly authentic."}
{"text":"Good food and the service and management were excellent which makes the whole experience that much better. Warm chips with queso(topped with chorizo) and side of guac were delicious. We weren't as hungry when the tacos came around but they were good. Fun busy atmosphere on a Saturday night and $3 tequila shots! Can't beat that. I'll be back"}
{"text":"After having a less than spectacular dining experience at Bakersfield, the owner reached out to me asking me how the restaurant could better meet my expectations. I really appreciated his attention to his customers. I took my boyfriend this time so he could provide a second opinion. He thought his margarita was good and we both enjoyed the chips and queso, he especially liked the red sauce. Ordering the appetizer was key this time as it and the two tacos I ordered kept me full. We both enjoyed our tacos and when you looked around the restaurant everyone was having a good time. My boyfriend especially liked the pork belly taco it had a glaze seared to a nice crisp. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Owner reached out to make this right.  That to me means a lot and is worth a second try for sure."}
{"text":"Service was fast and the atmosphere is nice but the tacos are just so so. The margarita was good I'll give them that but for $8-10 they better be. It's definitely chain prices 4 tacos an app and 2 drinks will run you $50 easy. If you want really good tacos in Cleveland go to Barrio."}
{"text":"The food was great, but service was terrible. Bar tender with the crazy eyebrows and long curly hair was super rude and had an extremely bad attitude. She was more concerned with cleaning her glasses than making drinks and was irritated when I asked for a drink. Get it together."}
{"text":"I just finished lunch at Bakersfield with my two year old son, wife and parents.   I used to really like this place. Sadly we were made to feel rather unwelcome.  The food was good as usual, but the service was cold and rude. The staffs demeanor was that of a group of people that did not want to be at work.   I probably won't go back!!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to our evening out as we wanted to try this place for awhile.  Took my daughter there for her birthday - the drinks were great.  We had the cheese dip appetizer and it was great!! Taco's were just ok - after going to Tako they are not worth it.  Sorry.  Great place for drinks and appetizers only - liked the atmosphere and service!!"}
{"text":"This guy they call Michael, the bartender, seems to know what he's doing behind the bar. Makes a decent Manhattan, and had a smile to make your jeans tight. Too bad he's not my type. Service is great and the women smell good.  Lots of tequila here. And bourbon. Thank God because it's damn cold out. Perfect temperature inside. Cheers"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for Ohio City. My biggest piece of advice is to not going in here to compare it to Barrio because it is indeed different. It is more of a tex mex style. I ordered the Paloma cocktail to start, which was well made. We also started with the queso, which comes out in a skillet. That was great. I ordered the short rib taco and the cochinta pibil taco. If you're getting an app, 2 tacos filled me up. If not though, i probably would have ordered 3. They arent kidding about the pibil taco being spicy either, it definitely is. I enjoy spice, so i liked it, but they definitely aren't kidding! Overall, i really enjoyed this place. It is a great fit for the Ohio City vibe."}
{"text":"This location needed a complete redesign and that's exactly what Bakersfield did! They've been open for a few weeks and everything was great! Great service, yummy food and fun atmosphere. The queso was hands down the best I've ever had. I would also recommend the white sangria. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch.  Got the chips and guac and queso.  The guac was one of the best I've ever had.  The queso isn't the typical white melty goodness you'd expect from a typical mexican place.  It comes out in a iron plate with a solid layer on the top.  I personally didn't like the queso, but everyone else did.  It's definitely a personal preference thing.  I got two tacos, Pork Belly and Short Rib.  Both were really good and you actually get a good amount of meat per taco.  The drinks were good as well.  I will definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"Love the place! My new fav in the burgh! Great ambience-the industry feel everyone has these days. And very good food. And surprisingly not expensive. Love it!"}
{"text":"***GET OVER THE PARKING!!*** get an Uber, park a few blocks away and walk or whatever lets you stop complaining about it. Seriously, if you want to eat GREAT food, check it out. It was recommended to us by a friend and we are so glad we came. BEST margaritas, short rib and pollo rojo tacos, AMAZING salsas and great staff. Would absolutely come back again. If you're worried about it being too packed, come on a Monday night. Great vibe, great food. Doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Like most hipster restaurants, this one has both its go-to signature qualities that it does well, as well as some things to just straight up avoid.   First of all, the chips aren't free. Grow up, Bakersfield--you salt the things so heavily, so as to make your customers thirsty, yet charge $3 for a basket of them. Granted, the salsas are pretty good, and the guacamole ($7) is very good, but come on--chips should be free.   Moving on to the tacos: maybe it's just as well (for their benefit) they charge for the chips, because unless you have lots of cash to drop, you'll want to fill up on them before your tacos arrive. These tapas-sized morsels are absolutely exquisite--go for the Pork Pastor with pineapple or the prime rib, but skip the fish--but are so small for the price; three are barely a satisfying lunch. At $3-4 a pop, you're talking about dropping at least $15-16 before even thinking about booze. Or chips.   Bakersfield has a few good strengths, but there are a couple of drawbacks--including the parking situation--that keep it from being a true home run. Will I return? Sure, but only if I can find a parking space. Sunday afternoon was a good time to go."}
{"text":"Attractive, hip decor. Good service and drinks. Food also good except for the fact that egg on short rib entree was nearly raw - the white wasn't merely still runny, it was clear. Husband picked it off and finished. I would have sent back, but that's why I'm giving them a 4 instead of a 5."}
{"text":"I always have good tacos and good drinks when I come to Bakersfield. I just started coming a year or so ago per a friends recommendation. The bartenders are always so knowledgeable and attentive. The fish tacos and I believe the pork belly were amazing."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch this past week and had a great first time experience. Tyler was the server and he assisted us all with ordering and suggested the grapefruit margarita, which I now wish I had a pale of at home. The food suggested was excellent and I'll be back"}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield a few times now and definitely keep going back. I was there last Friday for Happy Hour. It was a good crowd with young professionals, however the service at the bar wasn't greats. It took a significant amount of time to get someone's attention to get a drink for anyone in our group. However, that did not stop us from enjoying our evening with the lively crowd. We ordered food at the bar and it was all delicious, we tried an array of tacos in our group. My favorite was definitely the short rib.  I went there for dinner the next week. We made a reservation however, we were put at a community table. It wasn't a problem but I wish they could have explained that in our reservation. Once again, the tacos were delicious. This time I went with the veggie one and loved it!  A little spicy but very flavorful. 2 tacos were definitely enough to fill me up. One things that was great was the margarita they were featuring. It was very strong so prepare yourself! The table service was great. Our waitress was patient with us as we were talking and didn't decide on food for a bit. Definitely a good place for happy hour downtown and for dinner. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Food looks excellent. Tastes ok.  A little plain- the meat in my tacos was really well cooked and tender, but underseasoned."}
{"text":"This place is a new favorite. Our server Sarah was amazing she clearly loves working here, that's a rare thing. The food was super good the drink menu was awesome, the entire experience makes me want to come back. Come here first before barrio, before Momocho,  it's worth it. Want good tequila, craft beer, stupid good food, and passionate service? Come here!"}
{"text":"like any other spot in town gotta try it and see  Well there ..  Not impressed   Based on two people ordering two completely separate orders.  Guac is not a must get, please save yourself and google a better recipe for cheaper.  Drinks prices I mean come on, this is not LA or NYC.   But things may change so keep it up and in hopes for better tacos.  And separate the orders please my friend is allergic to fish with no epi pen on board. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place. Love the tacos, love my \"Johnny\" salad. Everything is delicious  and location is awesome. Will be back."}
{"text":"Had a delicious late dinner at Bakersfield after driving all day from northern Michigan. We had five different tacos, all of which were good, and two drinks each. The spicy margaritas are terrific."}
{"text":"We've been to Bakersfield a few times and have had a great experience each time. Most recently, we went for lunch with our dog since the patio is very dog friendly! The drinks mixed well, the guacamole was delicious and the short rib tacos are so flavorful. Our server Andrew was quick and courteous, and the manager Clay even brought an extra taco for our dog. We will definitely be going back soon, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Salsa is awesome and the guacamole is fantastic.  Pair these with the pitcher of margaritas great wait staff and super atmosphere the wife and I have found our go to place!!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield has fantastic food and ambiance but the waitstaff is clearly not well trained. On two occasions this has been our experience. The host did not want to seat us at a table that was high chair friendly because he told us those were reserved for large groups. It was 2:00 in the afternoon and there was no one in the restaurant, all the tables were open. After finally being able to sit at the table we asked for we had a very rude waitress. With all of the great places to eat in Charlotte I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First of all, you have to understand that Bakersfield is not a restaurant - it is a bar that does a few great things for food ... and I've sampled several things from the small menu and was never disappointed.   Bakersfield has filled a big void in the neighborhood offering a breezy, open, intimate yet relaxing place to gather with friends for a drink.  Great ambiance and great place to catch up with friends over a few drinks or kick off the night."}
{"text":"Super friendly, excellent service and delicious TACOS! We each ordered 3 and they came out on this huge platter and were beautiful! Had a Pineapple Margarita that was perfection. Turns out we have a Bakersfield (the OG) in our own backyard. Cincy! So, needless to say we will be back!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing time, great food, EXCELLENT guacamole and drinks. We met a new guy named Jason today and it was his first day BUT HE WAS AMAAAAAYYYZING. He helped us with our orders, bussed the tables quickly, and HE WAS HILARIOUS! We look forward to seeing you again, Jason (and Zsa Zsa!)! Welcome to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food.  The queso was great and the warm chips were on point.  I would definitely return.  Complimentary valet parking was great too. Menu is a la carte."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great cocktails..shitty service. We'll try it again, but this left a bad taste in our mouth, and it definitely wasn't from the queso dip."}
{"text":"Wow! Customer service lives. Manager even came by to check in on us after our wait was a little longer than expected. Great servers, ambience and food - original and savory. From the customer service to the quality of the food, I recommend you to check it out!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is one of those unique restaurants that you want to show off to all your friends and family. Such a great concept with small and healthier mexican dishes!   Pros: queso (add chorizo and beans); guacamole, salsa, CHICKEN CHORIZO TOSTADA; premium margarita  Cons: parking can be an issue, but if you figure out the valet guys across the street it's actually very simple; no reservations so be patient and enjoy the atmosphere; house margaritas could be better as could their wine list.  Overall their food and atmosphere gives this place an easy 4-star! You'll find yourself craving everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok I guess what you expect at a bar nothing wow about it. The drinks were very good. The waitress we had was great she was very nice and attentive and made recommendations. The hostess however was rude! She was annoyed and gave me attitude when we asked how much longer for our table. When people came in asking for a table she acted as if she was doing you a favor. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This is a great place if your looking for more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. If I was ten years younger and still enjoying cocktails I would rate five star. But, since I'm not I can only give it a three. The tables in the restaurant only accommodate the larger parties-a party of two will find themselves eating at the bar.  The food is good (not great or unique) I give it 3.5 stars.  The presentation of the food is nice and service quick."}
{"text":"We love it here. The tacos and sauces are delicious. Only one out of 10 times were we disappointed, so we did not deduct a star. On that occasion, the waitress forgot about us, and only a few tables were full, and additionally, she forgot to bring the replacement taco when the order was wrong, and did not modify an overcharge on our check. Every other visit, food was made in a timely manner, and we always enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I visited Bakersfield a week ago and haven't stopped thinking about the place since. It's incredible that a recently opened restaurant can hit so many home runs.  I'll start with the downside because there was really only one:   The wait. We got there a bit after 8 on a Friday and encountered an hour wait. This can only be explained by two things--there aren't a ton of tables...and the food is pretty awesome.   Okay, this place has really f*cking good tacos. Way better than Barrio. If you still prefer Barrio after trying Bakersfield, you're clearly from another planet. All of their descriptions sounded great, so I asked my server for help. He recommended the steak taco and the pollo rojo. I love both of these! Seasoned to perfection, perfect portion sizes, just all around awesome.  Their margaritas are great too--not too sour and not too sweet. They go down real smooth.  Their guac is a little different than most places. They leave the avocados in chunks, which threw me off at first, but I quickly learned to smash the chunks on my chip with a fork and then add some of the mystery green sauce from the table. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Haley was our waitress the 2 times we have been here. She is the best! Great place to eat before a Cleveland Indians game."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a great option for happy hour, drinks with friends, or dinner. All the bartenders here are awesome (liz, cristina, jenn) as is most all that works here (amanda at the door who'll always have a smile for you).   I'm partial to the bistec & chicken tacos, guac/chips, and their chicken milanese sandwich, and the food always comes out quick. They offer plenty of cold beer, tequilas, cocktails, and bourbons as well, so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"The food's pretty good, and the atmosphere is cool, but it felt a little overrated to me. I'd rather just hit up Condado or Sienna Mercato. Plus the seats are really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Charlotte! Having recently moved from SoCal I would say I've had my fair share of tacos. Oh and I always get an order of guacamole to go, I can't get enough of that stuff."}
{"text":"Place is legit. The spicy margarita is awesome. The cochinita and short rib tacos are near perfect, mole one was average. Tostada was outstanding too. Do yourself a favor and get a side of habanero salsa to put on everything. The quest was pretty good, but the added chorizo was great. Service at the bar was very good. Great place for a taco fix."}
{"text":"Had a pineapple margarita and queso with black beans, chorizo, and jalapeños.  Everything was decent but expensive.  $36 for two drinks and cheese is too much in my opinion."}
{"text":"Started off with the seasonal margarita... yum... then queso dip... good.. then a mix of the tacos and the papas... all delicious :-)  It was packed for a Tuesday with a good ambiance.  Coming back again!"}
{"text":"This has always been one of our favorite Mexican spots since moving to charlotte - tacos and margaritas are both great! Last night during dinner, we were sat next to the most obnoxious group of women looking for as much attention as possible by screaming at the top of their lungs the entire dinner.....at 7pm on a Tuesday. When the waiter asked if we'd like another drink after dinner I told him I couldn't stand to sit next to these women another minute and we had our next round of drinks at the bar instead to try and distance ourselves from the screaming ladies. After we ordered our drinks, the owner came over to personally apologize for the ladies ludicrous behavior and even bought us that round of drink....definitely unnecessary but an amazing gesture; especially because one bad table wouldn't be enough to keep us away from their pollo rojo tacos and spicy margs! Will continue to be a regular spot for us in Charlotte when looking for fast, great Mexican."}
{"text":"First and foremost, STOP RIGHT HERE if you are planning on hosting a big party at Bakersfield Pittsburgh.  The following is my most recent account in trying to arrange a 30th birthday party for approximately 50 people.    Let me begin by noting that I called over a month in advance in order to secure my desired date in mind.  With that being said the first time I called, the hostess referred me to their online email system to request a reservation of this size.  After not hearing back for over a week from a single soul, I obviously called back.  Upon doing so I was given the run around with - \"Hold on, I can't find the reservation book\"; \"Oh, I don't know the answer to that question\"; \"I'll have my manager call you back tonight\", etc.  Another 2-3 days lingered and naturally I was beginning to get irritated by this EXTREMELY FLAWED SYSTEM of theirs.  I was finally put into contact with a seemingly helpful, friendly manager named Charles who at the time, apologized profusely for the situation at hand.  He confirmed my date and even gave me his personal cell phone number to stay in touch if I had any remaining questions leading up to the party.  Well, a week before the party I decided to give good ole Charles a call to make sure everything was set.  After leaving a voicemail, I didn't hear back from him until nearly 10 hours later.  When he did call back he told me he couldn't find my name or reservation (now granted, he was the one who confirmed this with me over the phone just 3 weeks prior).  He proceeded to tell me he needed a half hour or so to figure things out (suspicious, right? Right.)  It was an hour later when he called back and dropped the ultimate bomb saying that the reservation was gone and there was nothing he could do about it since the remaining space was booked up.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!  He even had the audacity to admit that the event planning team was as fault because they didn't follow up with me leading up to the party to finalize the exact details (all the while acting cool as a cucumber as if this wasn't a real problem).  APPARENTLY THESE ARE ALL MINOR DETAILS THAT ARE NOT PERTINENT IN THE WORLD THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN. Just flabbergasting.    I think you can guess how irate I was at this point in time.  The lack of knowledge, disorganization, and mere ignorance that was portrayed over a month's span is simply distasteful, infuriating, and downright deplorable.  It's really quite shameful because the atmosphere, food, and drinks at this place are top notch, but the management and employees are despicable, inexperienced, and are not suited to meet the needs of the customer whatsoever.  So disappointing.  And best believe I'll be in touch with upper management."}
{"text":"Amazing guacamole, probably top 3 all time I have ever had. Chips come out hot and crispy, really delicious. I really enjoyed the short rib tostada. All around legit place!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, service, and ambience! Good local beer selection too and plenty of tequilas to choose from. It's as good as the original Cincinnati location!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food, salsa and queso was unique from anything else we've had. Steak tacos were incredible!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, freshly made. Friendly service. I would give it a 5th star but I had two beers and neither were cold enough. Even so I will return here again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"????????chitpole??????? tacos???????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? bistec taco???? ?????????????????"}
{"text":"Another great visit - this time for lunch. Service was fast and everyone very friendly...plus the food was delicious. Ordered tacos and chips with queso. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and nice staff. Exciting menu for carnivores but few vegetarian options. The red salsa was excellent and the guac was fine but it was $8, which is way too pricey for basic guac. Drinks are also expensive.   My biggest complaint is that all the tacos my table ordered were served on a single platter, which isn't optimal for people like me who are vegetarian or have food allergies. The other people I was with said they enjoyed the fish tacos but the other meats were lackluster and cold. Granted, they just opened and are perhaps still figuring themselves out, but I most likely won't go back- mostly because it's over priced for basics and there aren't any exciting food options for me."}
{"text":"This place is everything I had hoped Tako would be. The cocktails (especially the spicy margs) are perfect - not too sweet, perfect heat and BONUS you can get them by the pitcher. Their queso and chorizo is excellent, and I think their fish tacos are the best I've had in the city. This is my new favorite taco place."}
{"text":"I like the overall atmosphere of this bar, in fact, I've gone here on several occasions but I am a mixed drink kinda gal and they don't carry a lot of 'normal' liqueurs that every other friggin bar has. Get with the program !! In fact, between me and my friend, they didn't have 3 types that we asked for. Sheesh. Make sure you have a few back up drinks in mind. But it did seem like they have a lot of tequila's, which makes sense."}
{"text":"Loved the energy in this casual taco tequila focused restaurant!  Loved the queso!  Salads were interesting with fun choice of tacos. Staff was friendly woth lots of positive energy. $3 tequila special was a hit with me!"}
{"text":"3 dollar PBRs, 4 dollar tacos.  Short rib taco was the best.  Great service sitting at the bar. I would come back with friends and just order a bunch of food for the whole table."}
{"text":"Love the feel of a real Mexican cantina with the floor to ceiling open windows reminds us of places we've eaten at in Mexico. Most importantly we love the  fresh ingredients and the high quality food and cocktails. We've eaten here quite a few times since it opened and everytime I want to force myself to eat more because its so damn tasty! Right now, we can't get enough of the short rib taco, short rib sandwich for my hubby and the jalapeno margarita. The service is normally spot on but the one time we had an inconsistent experience, the owner rectified the situation immediately. Also very cool to have the chalk board in the back to occupy the kids. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Tacos are amazing, margaritas on point, and guac to die for.  Even better on a nice day with the garage windows open."}
{"text":"This place is great. The selection for food and drinks is amazing. I can stop up anytime and get great service. Seth is great! Always treats my family and I like we are VIP"}
{"text":"Loved the menu.  Great guacamole. Cocktails were very good. Enjoyed the atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty cool. The patio is a really nice addition! I only wish there were more tables to dine at. We ended up just grabbing a spot at the bar because it was an hour and half wait for a table. The margaritas were so strong and yummy! I'd recommend getting the pitcher if you're going to have more than two. We got the guac and chips to start and it was a nice app. I don't know if I'd get it again though. The guac was pretty basic. The short rib tacos are were amazing!! The service was also good. There were 4 bartenders behind the bar and never did they look overwhelmed and they always looked like they were honestly happy to serve everyone (even the super annoying drunk guy next to us).  All in all, I'm not dying to go back but if someone suggested to go I wouldn't say no!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, nice atmosphere, nice food. Nothing blew me away and for the price points I thought it might be a little better. I'd probably come back with a group but it wasn't especially unique."}
{"text":"We came here for a casual dinner & drinks on a Friday night.  It was crowded on both floors but we were able to grab stools at the bar.    We ordered chips and salsa to share, and I was surprised by the amount of chips.  I feel like in a lot of places they don't serve as many as they did here.  We tried both of the salsas, my friend liked the green but I preferred the red.  It had a much smokier taste & I'm a fan of that.  I ordered the bistec taco and it was incredibly good!  I also had a bite of my friend's fish taco, and next time I think I will order one for myself.    For drinks, we just ordered a few beers.  I thought it was very cute that they served the beer in mini 16-oz boots.  It's not something you see in a lot of places & it made drinking beer a little more fun.  But next time I plan on trying a margarita, I watched the bartender make a few and they looked delicious!  Bakersfield is a nice addition to the cultural district, it's nothing fancy but it has a fun atmosphere and the food and drinks are great!  I'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is absolutely delicious!  For drinks I ordered the Bakersfield Sour which I loved.  I typically don't like drinks with sours in them but this one was so refreshing.  I also tried the red sangria which was also a great drink option.   Definitely get the queso!! This was my favorite part! You can get the queso plain or with a bunch of different toppings.  I got all of the toppings, and it was so good!   I really like how the tacos are smaller so that you are able to try more of them.  I ordered three of them, and they were all delicious.  I loved the pollo rojo, I think that was my favorite taco out of the three that I ordered.   I will have to go back to try more tacos and to get that queso again!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for a bachelorette party! Party of 13. The staff was overly accommodating and it looked like they have a great team approach as we saw many wonderful servers stop at our table. Liz was our waitress and was fantastic. Super helpful and on top of her game!   Being that our party was so large we got the $15 per person special where they bring apps, salads and a combo of their 5 top selling tacos out until you basically stay stop. if up have a large party this is the way to go.  Chips and salsa, query for our apps. The chips are really good, quad very fresh and big chunks of avocado. The green salsa was my favorite. The reddish brown had a more smoky taste to it. We hot the Johnny salad which was also delicious. Nice mix of tastes.   The tacos were... Fish, chicken, pot belly, beef and I think the portobello mushroom. If you like spicy, the chicken is the way to go. The fish taco was probably my favorite because it has a nice taste to it. However, the braised beef and pot belly weren't too far behind. Didn't try the portobello, but heard it was also great.  Awesome experience. The 3.00 tequila shots were also delicious! I will be back"}
{"text":"I'd definitely say this place is a fusion of hipster meets Mexican. The queso and pollo rojo taco's were great, papas tostada seemed alright, and the fish tacos were a little off. The management and service on the other hand was great."}
{"text":"I really enjoy everything about Bakersfield. I've been twice, once at a table (for lunch) and once at the bar (for late drinks and food.) The food is good and decently priced for that type of quality. The drinks are crafty and delicious. Service was good. The only thing I would change about the place is the music. Especially late night, after 9/10... that country/Mexican ear slaughter of music gets really tiring. That place would be so lucrative with a music change. Aside from that, will be back for tacos and spicy margaritas!   PS. I don't know if we just got it from a certain batch but both times the guac was SUPER chunky and not in a good way. Like in a \"break your every single chip and lift up half an avocado way.\""}
{"text":"Super yummy tacos and fairly priced menu. My recommendations are the fish and pollo rojo tacos on their housemade tortillas. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, staff and food. Tacos/guac were solid and marargita was on point.  Will come back next time in town"}
{"text":"Guac is phenomenal.  Best fish taco I've ever had! Our bartender Jessie took care of us! Great recommendations of drinks and menu. Awesome place for drinks and good food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was definitely good an friendly right off the bat. I ordered 3 different tacos an a house margarita. The margarita had a little extra kick to it and hit the spot. Now onto the food. The tacos were amazing and probably the freshest mexican food i ever had. Taste like something a top notch chef handcrafted himself. Only big negative was the price was a little pricey for the taco portions. 4 bucks a piece for some small type tacos that will leave you hungry still after eating 3 of them. My suggestion is to have to tacos come in a meal format as well with rice, beans, or chips to help satisfy the hunger!   But yes this place is worth a checkout if ur a die hard mexican food lover looking for something different of higher quality. Just don't go there really hungry as it will take a lot of purchases $$$ fill u up. And this is coming from a fairly small guy that doesn't eat large portion meals to begin with."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great atmosphere and friendly staff. I was very excited to check this place out and was not disappointed. There are a few new taco restaurants in Pittsburgh, which are great but unfortunately are hard to walk right in and eat without making reservations weeks in advance. Bakersfield is very large -- two whole floors with two bars. I know this will be my default walk-in restaurant in the future. Right on Penn Ave mixed in with a lot of other new restaurants, this one has huge open windows that will be great in the summer. The tacos were great. They're $4 each and it's fun to mix and match. The guac was great as well. They have fun beer boots and amazing $3 shot specials daily. I'm very impressed with this place and will be back often. It's a great place to hang out with a lot of people as well."}
{"text":"Likes: Great margaritas, some of the best guacamole and cheese dip I've ever had  Gripes: tacos are decent but not great, it becomes pretty crowded and loud"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great!! Service was fast. The pineapple margarita was beautiful but just tasted ok. Salsa verde was very good. Mole taco.... oh my gosh delicious. However the other tacos... corn truffle was just ok. Thought the mahi fish taco was very.. fishy. My husband loved the el pastor. Queso is not the typical... it's more of a baked cheese - wouldn't get it again. Overall I'd come back for the mole tacos, atmosphere, service and to give the original margarita a try."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The portions are pretty small. The price is reasonable though. It is not like original Mexican food."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of the place first of all. The low lighting and cool light bulbs made for a modern chic feeling, but the Johnny Cash and June Carter playing in the background completed the rockabilly whiskey and tequila drinking theme. The hardwood floors and seating arrangements were nice and made the place feel comfortable.  Started off with a pitcher of bakersfield margaritas which hit the spot right away. I'd had a long weekend on my feet, and my friend had just gotten off the interstate from a long distance haul, so this 64 oz concoction of tequila and fresh sour mix was much needed. Pretty cool that it comes with a huge paddle of a spoon to play with (at least that's what I did with it), though I'm sure it's truly meant for stirring purposes.   Ordered some guacamole to accompany said beverages, and it was tasty and fresh. huge Chunks of avocado lead me to believe they don't use the crap that comes out of a bag. For entrees we ordered (from most favorite to least) the mole, conchinita pibil, short rib, and fish tacos, which were served \"family style\". Mole sauce was perfect, and the meat was tender. The habeñero sauce on the pibil taco lends it the perfect kick at the end of your bite. Loved it. Short rib with the radish was great, but it just tasted like short rib, and nothing more. I wanted to love the fish taco, but didn't. Perhaps I'm just a picky fish taco eater,  but I've had way better. The slaw, however, was a nice refreshing crunch of a bite.  Service was great from the time we walked in the door,  to the time we walked out the door. They'd only been open a week- so the staff seemed a little intense, but I think that intensity will calm once the place gets settled. Will definitely be coming back as I enjoyed my meal over all, and the reprieve the margaritas offered!!  W"}
{"text":"Last night was my first and last time at Bakersfield. Service was terrible. Took 45 mins for me to get a margarita. The group I was with ordered tacos that were tiny. The server had no idea which tacos were on the tray. The menu is unimaginative when it comes to vegetarian options. Condado is around the corner with better tacos, drafts, margaritas, and staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Best guac in CLT. Tacos are in my opinion the best in the city as well. If you want a fun night now, then this place is a no brainer"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Pittsburgh in my opinion  Queso is an absolute must, I tried the pollo rojo, shrimp, fish and hongos. The hongos was surprisingly my favorite. They are on the smaller side which I prefer since you can try different kinds.   Seasonal margaritas are delicious and strong!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after 7/4 fireworks (around 11:00PM). I was impressed that this place was open considering the federal holiday. Restaurant is fairly open air on two walls. Parking on the street, in the middle of what would otherwise be a busy Ohio City. Ended up ordering chips and guacamole, the Bakersfield margarita, short rib tostada, grilled mahi taco, and pollo rojo taco.  I will give the TL;DR version first. This is not legit Mexican, nor is it legit Tex-Mex. The only thing that makes the food remotely close to Mexican is the meat and how it's prepared. The Tex is barely there. The rest is just American. I hate to say this, but being a chain from Cincinnati, it kind of explains things.  The guacamole was not real guacamole. It was basically smashed avocado with some lime juice, salt, and maybe some cilantro. Couldn't really see the cilantro in the avocado, though. No red onion. No tomato. No pepper (jalapeno). So it was really chips with avocado. Eight dollars for basically one single smashed avocado. Not only that, but the salsa they gave was a bit of the joke. While the cilantro-based salsa that was also given was... cilantro-based, the \"hot\" (read: supposed to be spicy) red, tomato/pepper based salsa was more of a smoky chipotle behind it, and had none of the spice you'd expect out of a what was was supposed to be spicy salsa. I ended up going through about a cup and a half of the red salsa (about half of the squeeze bottle) and didn't even break a sweat. Hotness level for the cilantro salsa was 0/10. Red salsa was like a 2/10.  Sorry, guys, but when you say something is supposed to be spicy, especially the salsa, actually make it spicy.  The margarita was pretty standard, nothing really to write home about. Not worth the $8.  The short rib was a mistake to order. Yes, it was tender, but the flavor was lacking. The tostada was basically a taco salad. Chopped romaine lettuce with some almost slaw-like dressing on the bottom. On the top was the tostada, which had some beans, cheese, and a egg cooked medium-well. The Bakersfield hot sauce wasn't \"hot\" at all, and didn't have much flavor to it. I dumped another quarter cup of the red salsa to give the short rib (and salad) a little more flavor for the last third of the salad.  The pollo rojo was pretty tender, but the red sauce kind of drowned out the flavor of the chicken. The mahi taco was probably the best out of what was ordered. The slaw was pretty good, but it overwhelmed the fish. Probably one of the better fish tacos in the Midwest, but certainly nowhere near the balance of flavor you'd get compared to fish tacos on the West coast. Or the kick.  While the menu is pretty simple, and makes things pretty straightforward, the food doesn't really justify the price. You're really paying for the location and the \"hipster\" atmosphere of the restaurant and perhaps a bit of the \"ethnic\" surcharge. I initially wanted to give this place 3.5/5 stars, but after really thinking about what worked and didn't work (and it mostly didn't work), there's much better Mexican/Tex-Mex to be had, especially for the price from actual taco trucks and Mexican establishments... So, I really can't recommend this place. Plus, Johnny Cash singing covers for 90s songs kills the atmosphere. So, two stars it is. Sorry. It was a dud."}
{"text":"Tonight, I attended an event at Bakersfield.  The bartenders were attentive and professional.  The taco's were delicious, and they were able to maintain the right number of taco's on the buffet table - not too many that they get cold, but enough on the table at all times so that they are hot and ready for people arriving at different times.  The noise level, which is a major concern of mine since many places make it impossible to talk, was appropriate that you could talk to the person next to you, but a little hard to hear the person across the table.  Their tacos, chips and dips were delicious.  Several months ago,  I was at Bakersfield,  with family,  We all thought it was delicious then, and they have been able to maintain their quality and standards.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We have been a few times and we love it! Great place to go with friends for a nice laid back environment. The servers are very friendly and easy going. You can walk out with a full belly and a bit of a buzz for not a lot of coin. Definitely will go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super tasty tacos!! Had the tacos al pastor and the sauces were legit too, so watch spiciness. Pricier than most legit taco places off S.Blvd for same taste and limited menu featuring \"fancy\"/hipster-ish tacos. Slow service for it not being half full, but the food and people watching was cool."}
{"text":"Honestly, this could have gone so so wrong... but boy did it go RIGHT!! I was craving a margarita & being from out of town on business, I asked YELP to help me out- Bakersfield Penn here I come. We were worried about how busy it looked inside, but the hostess was nice enough to make room at a community table for us, she assured us that our server (insert name here) would be with us shortly. Well, after about 10+ long minutes of no hello, no water, no.... anything... I was able to make eye contact with a bartender (Paige) and she came right over. She asked what she could do for us & we explained that we seemed to be forgotten. She immediately apologized and took our drink & appetizer order. Quickly the manager, Alex, came over to say sorry & make sure we were still satisfied, he also let us know that (insert name here) would be with us shortly to take our dinner order. Once again.. 15-20 minutes go by with out anyone to come by. We let Paige know & she was very apologetic & seemed embarrassed that her coworker had abandon us. Paige informed us that it was actually her first week & was still learning but would take our orders and make sure we would be taken care of from then on. Alex came over and explained that this was not how things usually were there but did not try to make excuses, he just took ownership & handled it. We had delicious & fresh food, based on Paige's recommendations. I was not disappointed. I would come back here & will let my local friends know that this place is WONDERFUL - great atmosphere, tasty food, strong drinks & friendly staff. THANKS!!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, this location is always changing businesses, no one has stayed for more than a year recently. Bakersfield has a great concept and the food is delicious. Great margaritas and specials. Really satisfied with the new walking distance restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very noisy. You had to pay for chips. Food was so-so and I had a hard time getting my water filled"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and attentive staff!  My husband and I wanted to try something new and Bakersfield was a pleasant surprise.   I tried the Pozole which had the perfect amount of spice.  The Willie salad was not your usual boring salad and I also shared my husband's tacos.  He loved the Pollo Rojo (very tender braised chicken taco) and my favorite was the Pork Belly Pastor (probably the best pork I have ever had).  Our server, Mackenzie, was friendly and helpful.   She was able to direct my husband who can food shy, to find something he would like.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great girls day out at Bakersfield.  The bistec tacos were delicious, the guacamole was fresh and the chips were homemade and warm. The margaritas were fresh squeezed and they even have a skinny margarita option not on the menu.   Katerina our waitress was extremely fast, friendly, and accommodating. She made our experience fantastic, we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is awesome. Since it's opened a few months ago I've been there several times. I've never actually gone for dinner, but we usually end up ordering something. I've had the short rib and al pastor tacos, both of which were really good and flavorful. I'll order them again, but I want to try some of the other items as well. It's never been super crowded when I've gone in (I usually don't go until 9-10pm during the week), but I can see that it would get crowded during normal dinner hours.   The atmosphere is also really cool. They play old western movies on the TVs and have a cool bar area. They do a different $3 shot each day of the week so be sure to check them out (they are listed on the wall in the back near the kitchen). Also, they serve $2 PBR drafts and they serve them in the coolest cowboy boot mugs! Chips and salsa isn't free, but worth it to share with the table! They usually offer two different salsas (a green and a red) and both are very flavorful. I'd prefer a spicier salsa, just not sure if they have one available, but I may ask next time!"}
{"text":"Scott C.  was absolutely amazing! He was very vigilant and made sure that we were happy throughout our visit! He choose the majority of our tacos and was spot on! Wonderful food and amazing service! Can't wait until we come back!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation over two hours in advance and when we got there still made us wait 45 min."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks. The guacamole and the quest are a must. We sampled nearly a the tacos and they were all delicious. I don't think you can wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Although nothing was terrible about this restaurant I felt it just wasn't above par, or even at par for that matter. For the price, I expect to get something decent. Not some fried fatty dried out meat and stale tortillas (what I exactly got). Again, nothing terrible but nothing that great. If you want really good Mexican downtown I suggest Emiliano's-there's a big difference in authenticity of the food as well as quality."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night around 10, not too busy at all. We ordered chips and guacamole and it was great and delivered quickly and the variety of salsas were delicious. We had the Loretta salad it was amazing perhaps slightly overdressed but incredible flavors. The delivery time for our tacos was incredibly long, which is weird because again not so many people. Mahi mahi taco was incredible but the shrimp was my favorite!!! Amazing restaurant highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Cool atmosphere and good food.  The chips were fresh and the queso was addicting.  The fish taco was ok but the short rib taco was wonderful.  I came here for a girls night with a bunch of friends and it was hard to hear the other end of the table.  That isn't really a complaint, just an observation.  Some of the girls split a margarita pitcher and they said it was strong but also very good.  I stuck with beer, can't go wrong there.  Anyway, its a fun place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Impressive tequila selection. Not sure what they put in the queso dip, but it was ridiculously good. The tacos, while not the cheapest, are worth every penny. Try a short rib taco - it's something everyone should have in their life. I will be going every time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Just finished our dinners and drinks. We really enjoyed our experience. Margaritas were perfect, tacos were delicious, and our server was awesome."}
{"text":"First time here and It is their Second night!! Lovely place! Nice and cozy. Great drink specials!!And  awesome staffs.They played old western movie which is perfect for the atmosphere. I want give them a FIVE  stars and I definitely come back:)  And very friendly price ^^ TACOS  TEQUILA  WHISKEY"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waitress gave me attitude for asking what the most popular dish was and how large the portions were. Will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. The guacamole is fantastic and the tacos can't be beat. I really love the rojo chicken and the vegetarian tacos. And, Lissa makes the best sangria in town. Always have excellent service!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had at Bakersfield is great. The margaritas are delicious, I've had the house, jalepeno and pineapple and would recommend all 3 - not too sweet or tart. The guac is a classic fresh guac- tangy and crisp. Their queso is the most unique queso I've ever tried -you must try the queso when you go. It's a little grainy on the bottom with a cheese broiled on top - it has an amazing texture and contrast of flavors between savory and oniony on the bottom and classic cheesy on the top. Their tacos are also good, but when I go, those aren't what I look forward to the most. Staff is always pleasant and it's never too busy, I am always seated in a reasonable amount of time (30-45 minutes, if not immediately.) Their bar is large and never overcrowded with people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant in Ohio City that has a different menu than the others. The great atmosphere had fantastic house made tacos. I ate 5 myself. The bar tenders were very courteous as well. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos, guac, and atmosphere! Jessie was a great bartender, definitely recommend for a good \"hangover cure\" spot."}
{"text":"This is a place I could call home!  A couple walks in the door. Both turn to each other and give the downward head nod of approval. They are greeted and seated immediately. \"This place is spot on.\" \"I know...right?\"  Hey...here comes the waiter. Perfect timing. Chips and salsa and some local beers. \"Hey...they just delivered our chips and salsa to the table next to us.\" They kept them anyhow.  Grrrr!!  \"Oooh, their salsa verde is on point!\" \"It is...now, check out the smokey red...delicious!\" Kind of thought the whole \"chipotle\" thing had played itself out...but found myself to be wrong, as the house salsa is quite terrific!  \"Look at the selection of tacos!\" I may be in love, as I make several of these at home. We tried many, but the big winner was the pork belly. Perfectly done! Perfectly!  Loved the beer, loved the food, loved the place.  My only advice would be to add a bit more sauce to the fish taco and deliver the chips and salsa to MY table next time.   Try: The pork belly tacos with some bourbon to sip  Avoid: Ummm...nothing...everything was great!"}
{"text":"Tacos = Delicious...   Picnic Bench Seating = Terrible  Order the chips and guac, the carnitas and short rib tacos and request a booth. Because the picnic bench will ruin the experience."}
{"text":"Where Caly meets Texas and covers it in homemade quac. The guacamole is to die for. Chunky yet smooth, tangy yet salty, flavorful and satisfying. The tacos are perfect like street tacos should be. Being from Texas I'm a tough critic on quake as well as salsa...both made the cut and beg me to return with friends."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and wait staff were very  friendly and attentive. We were in Pittsburgh for my son's baseball tournament. Took my two kids here and they enjoyed the food no compliants.  I have been to another location in Indy. The place always delivers. Good value, good food, good times."}
{"text":"Found this during a lunchtime walk and came back for dinner the next night.  They opened last week.  Not open for lunch yet until they get all the kinks worked out, so I was told.  I thought the kinks seemed worked out at dinner service.  Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. She knew the menu well for being new to it.  I did not realize at the time of coming here that it was a small chain.  They have 5 other locations in 4 different states.  But it didn't seem like a chain.   They specialize in Tacos, Tequila, and Whiskey, but they have a good selection of beer and wine as well as cocktails.  They have a special shot for $3 every day of the week.  We started with the standard chips and salsa that is your foundation for every Tex-Mex type of place.  We were not disappointed.  The verde salsa was fabulous and the red smokey chipolte salsa kicked my butt, in a really good way!  The chips were also good.  No store bought tostitos.  We opted for 2 tacos each (could have pushed in 3).  I got the Mole and the Short Rib.  Both excellent.  They were not served with 2 thin tortillas to hold all the goods.  Instead, the goods were wrapped in one single corn tortilla shell that was thicker.  I particularly loved it more than 2 thin dry ones.  My husband had the Fish and the Pork Belly Pastor tacos.  He said both were good.    I will definitely come back here again.  Good service and food.  If I liked tequila and whiskey, I might love it even more."}
{"text":"The margarita's were excellent! Bartender was very nice. Tacos were very good as well!"}
{"text":"Ton of hype around Bakersfield. A friend from Cincinnati had always raved about how great the tacos/guac are and how the pitchers of margs are fantastic. I went here after work before a Pens game about a month ago, and we decided to go downstairs because they have TVs.  Tacos are great, and the ability to order individual tacos is a huge plus. Chips and salsa are bottomless, and I like the two salsa options I had that day (a verde and chipotle salsa). The house margarita definitely lived up to the hype. I think they do a great job on the margs. Great flavor and you can tell they use quality ingredients.  My only complaint, what is up with the television selections downstairs? I understand they don't have TVs upstairs (at least that's what I've been told, don't take my word for it), but the TVs downstairs were playing some dumb old-timer movie in black and white with no sound... Now I'm not a huge, die-hard Pens fan, but obviously I wanted to watch the game. The bartenders were totally on board with turning off the weird movie, but they still had to ask permission to get the game on. Anyway, thought that was odd. Probably the vibe they're going for, but come on guys, this is Pittsburgh, people want to watch sports at a bar. Maybe that policy has changed since, and I hope that's true.  Overall, I'd definitely go back...I haven't had the famous guac yet."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a perfect addition to W25th. Nice patio, great drinks and delicious food.  We enjoyed an early weekend lunch on the patio. No wait. Helpful, attentive staff.  We had the fish, mole, pollo rojo, and al pastor tacos. They were all great with the al pastor being my favorite. We also shared an order of the quest which is awesome paired with the green salsa.  I'm a big fan of a spicy margarita and theirs did not disappoint.  Win for families: they have individual milk boxes for kids which I love because you never know how fresh the milk is when dining out in a restaurant that doesn't frequently use milk!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for someone to crack the code to make a restaurant or bar work out in this space for a while now, and Bakersfield has done it! This is maybe more of a bar than it is a restaurant, but it works great on both levels and is pretty authentic mexican street food...don't expect cheddar cheese and sour cream and lettuce on your taco. The specialty drinks are top notch and worth the price, but you can drink more cheaply from the decent beer list or daily specials. There is a great tequila and whiskey selection.  Don't be a baby about the lack of parking. It's a densifying neighborhood only a mile from downtown in a growing city, you're not entitled to free plentiful parking everywhere. Take a cab/uber, walk, bike, or park on a side street a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Omg I can not get enough of this place simply amazing food drinks you name it! Prices are amazing! I love love it very fresh and authentic food!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Torta Milanesa and tacos were spot on.  Definitely need to come back and get some drinks and hang out.  A can't miss kind of place"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Fantastic guac and chips. The queso and chips are awesome. Tacos were very good definitely going back there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went a few weeks after it opened, great service and great food. Pitchers pf margaritas were delicious and very reasonably priced. Tried several taco options, the spicy pork was my favorite. A great atmosphere for happy hour as well. Highly recommend the guac and queso with chorizo in it."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state! I ordered the 'Short Rib Tostada'! This restaurant has unique Mexican combinations - not your normal dishes! It will inspire you to try something different than you are used to! We started off with the Chips and Queso with Chorizo - absolutely amazing. The sever was very gracious and made our dinner experience quite good! They do have a red and green salsa (complimentary) - both were very good! I preferred the red salsa to the green salsa! Will definitely come back in the future! Love the ambiance and seating arrangement!"}
{"text":"To be honest I saw the reviews hoping for something good but it honestly wasn't amazing at all. The queso dip with drinks in the beginning was okay but once we actually ordered tacos that was when this place went from a 4 to a 2. The tacos were just awful, we got mole/carne/fish and something else but every single one I just honestly didn't want to finish. The carne Asada was one of the worst I've ever had in my entire life. I do not really recommend this place unless you about nasty off American tacos..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and came out quick. Our server, Sara, was awesome. I highly recommend the short rib tostado and Palomas!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The queso appetizer is super yummy and the guacamole waa super fresh and chunky! Must try!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Bakersfield has finally moved in! The space is beautifully designed with a great wraparound bar as the centerpiece. Nearly every spot at the bar has coat/ purse hooks AND individual outlets (woot woot!). There are benches at the front of the restaurant for groups and booths on both sides of the bar.  Drinks: I highly recommend starting with the house margarita. It's the perfect combo of tart, sweet, and salty. And it's served in a mason jar.  Food: The queso is very good. We've gotten it plain each time, but I'm trying it with beans and/or chorizo on my next visit. The tostadas are larger than I was expecting and flavorful, but kind of awkward to eat. If you're on a first date and trying to look cute while eating, they probably aren't the way to go. The tacos are also delish. We've had the mole, rojo, fish, short rib, and cochinitas. The fish was the only one we didn't love. It was a tad too frozen fish sticky for my taste.  Service: They're attentive, friendly, and go above and beyond to make you happy. I've only been a few times, but our previous servers have recognized me on each of our visits and stopped by to say hi.  Reservations: Make 'em now! If you don't have a res, they'll call you when your table is ready.  Hopes & dreams: I hope they put the game on those awesome TVs on game days. It'd be a great spot for football watching. Also, I'd love to see them expand to weekend brunch service (pretty please??)."}
{"text":"Nice place!! Will be coming back again! Spicy margarita is best in town! And takos! Reminds me of Cali!"}
{"text":"This place is for you if you are looking to go out with friends. The drinks are plentiful with a great assortment of bourbon, whiskeys, and tequilas. The cheese dip...just get it. And the guac tickled the taste buds. Tacos were on point. Some food for thought....some tables are communal but you have more room than other restaurants create with multiple small tables. But would still steer clear of taking a first date here. There's a bar in the basement but it's meant more for a drink before being seated on the main floor. If you grab a table in the basement, get your drink at the bar first and watch out for the distance between the chair and the table...it's a tight fit."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened with a couple of friends. Had a platter of tacos that had so many great flavors.  The only thing I wasn't too keen on was the taco shell itself.  We had a round of my favorite Tequila, Don Julio 1942. The manager who was helping in the opening of the place gave us each Herradura Anejo which she highly recommended.  Could be my new favorite now."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever had! My group sat outside and we could see some of the tall buildings downtown. The only part is they don't own that lot right buy them so we had to pay $5."}
{"text":"Amazing, I got four different tacos (which they sell individually so it's easy to dry different ones) and was blown away by the flavors. The guac was the best I've ever had. Definately a new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty crowded even for a mid-week night!  Ponied up to the bar, where the bartenders were nice, and the beer selection was solid.  Once my party arrived, we were immediately seated, and got to the TACOS!  I had chicken, pork and fish, and every one of them was excellent.  The atmosphere was western - John Wayne movies and great southern & blues rock.  All in all, a great experience, and one you have to have if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The seasonal margaritas are amazing! Nice space that opens up to the sidewalk on pretty weather days. Food is good but a bit over priced. Parking can be tricky in this area."}
{"text":"I stopped in last Friday for some tacos and a beer, it was absolutely perfect. The downstairs bar was really busy and service was faster than I ever expected for the amount of people there. The food was perfect and the staff was amazing.  Will definitely make it back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Been here too many times to count. Awesome tacos with homemade corn tortillas. Also, the drinks, especially, the whiskey sours and margaritas are the best. Get Eve as your sever if you can, if not, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas! As Yelp suggested, I loved the pineapple margarita. Tacos were good as well. We got four tacos and split them among two people (with guac and salsa) and that was enough food. Guac was not the best I've ever had, as some had claimed earlier, but it was tasty and served in a good portion size. Definitely a great place to start your night in Ohio City. It is a little off the main strip and we did wait for a table. Still, the atmosphere is very relaxed and we enjoyed margaritas on the patio while we waited."}
{"text":"Updated Review:  I've left my original review below, but after receiving a gift card to return and giving Bakersfield another shot.  I had the exact same food as the previous time, but I successfully identified what ruined my meal on my previous experience.  Our chips salsa and guacamole came out before the lights were dimmed this time and I was able to see the mounds of salt on the chips.  I enjoyed them this time however, as I brushed off copious amounts of salt before eating the chips.  I was therefore able to enjoy my tacos and I would highly recommend the fish taco!  The salsas and guacamole are fantastic as well without the overly salty chips.  Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 starts, but am limited to 3 with Yelp.  I'm also likely to return from time to time on my own dime and eat the fish tacos, but I will probably take my own tortilla chips.  Also, this time, our food came out in sequence of the orders around us and ours along with the tables around us came out much faster as well.    Original Review:  This might be the absolute worst food I have ever eaten.  We had the chips, guacamole, and two salsas as an appetizer and a total a five of the smallest street tacos I have ever seen at $4 a piece.  The only flavor from every single bite of food was salt.  I actually had blisters on the roof of my mouth and lips from all of the salt.  I recommend eating a banana for some potassium to balance the sodium in your body if you eat at Bakersfield, which we never will again.  The service was slow and most of the tables around us that ordered after us received their food before us.  If I put want some flavor filled Latin American food and would like it sooner than later at a more friendly price, I highly recommend Sabor Latin Grill any day of the week and especially Tuesday's for $1 taco day."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! My mom and I shared the chips and guacamole, the short rib tapa, and pollo taco. We ended up taking our sandwich home,  up we filled up on the yummy guacamole and chips with the green sauce. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are great! And the margaritas? are really tasty. You order individual tacos and can pick between different ones. The Chicken ones are really good and pulled pork is awesome. And the queso. And the guacamole."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant while in town visiting friends. After ordering, our server did not come back to the table for over 25 minutes. We needed refills on drinks and began to wonder if there was an update on our food. Eventually we received our food, but we were missing two entrees. Our server did not seem to notice. We had to ask for the missing entrees several times by hunting the server down. One entree came out 10 minutes after the other food, but the other was still missing. Our server then disappeared. It was almost an hour since ordering food and over 20 minutes since the first entrees were brought to the table. We saw our server peak out of the kitchen, notice we saw her, and run away. It was not until I pulled our server out of the kitchen to inform her I no longer wanted the food I had waited an hour for because I did not want anything to do with this restaurant, including the food, that the manager FINALLY involved herself in the situation. Only to tell us she was too busy to acknowledge the poor experience we were having.   I was shocked by the lack of service at such a cool place, and even more surprised by the lack of apology by the front of house staff and management. I am still not sure what the hiccup was- whether our server forgot to ring in the rest of the food, there was a hiccup in the kitchen, or whatever it was, it is the JOB of the front of house staff to manager customers expectations and make up for mistakes."}
{"text":"We love there Guacamole to start. Also the pitcher of margaritas is great!!! They are known for there tacos which are delicious."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Bakersfield tonight. After eating at the Cincinnati Bakersfield on the Rhine we were eager to experience Pittsburgh with our daughters. It did not disappoint. We shared the humongous Laretta salad together after polishing off the queso and quac and chips. The fresh made quac was amazing, the queso flavorful putting your ordinary nacho cheese to shame. Mom and Dad ordered the salads and the girls dove right in. The salad had the perfect ratios of tomatoes, radishes, pepitos and dressing. The lettuce of mixed greens namely arugula held all the toppings quite well. Then we devoured the tacos. 9 between 5 of us. Everyone agrees the house made taco shell is to die for. You could put beef jerky between the fold and it would taste great. The short rib taco is the signature. Perfect combination of sweet and BBQ. The staff was amazingly friendly. We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte a year ago by way of Phoenix, California, and Texas. So I didn't have much hope of finding a great Mexican restaurant in town. I spent a year searching for a great taco, tostada, or margarita that I could easily find out West. I couldn't find anything here for a whole year. So missing good Mexican food was one of the toughest things in my move here.   A few weeks ago I just stumbled onto Bakersfield by accident. I've been here a number of times since. It is definitely the best authentic Mexican I've had in the city. The food is just on point and every time. It's not pretentious but it's a very nice place as well - the decor is great, the service is great, and it fits right into the Dilworth neighborhood.  The servers and bartenders have all been totally cool. One of the bartenders in particular, Karl, has been great. He's very attentive and has been really welcoming to me and my friends.   I think I've finally found my neighborhood Mexican joint in the neighborhood - finally a piece of the West in Charlotte. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"VERY friendly staff and service! The tacos were amazing, as well as the selection of beer and whiskey. We went for lunch and had a wonderful time, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Timely attentive service with delicious food and great drink specials.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but their customer service is amazing! We started with chips and queso with chorizo which was great! Our waitress was fantastic and accidentally brought out the wrong tacos but brought out the right ones shortly after and they were great! I, along with 2 others, enjoyed our tacos. All were fresh and full of flavor. We could not believe they took care of our tacos for the mix up!! The food was awesome and the drinks were great too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great tacos and margaritas. The wait may be long but this is a great place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Solid place. Server was friendly and got our order in quickly. Guac was out of this world, chunky and delcious. Tacos looked kind of weird (small tortillas?) but tasted good. I do wish they had grilled mahi instead of breaded though. Enjoyed the vibe inside - nice place for a bite, a beer, or to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Who doesn't love whiskey. Great patio. Attentive staff. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and nice atmosphere. Tacos are flavorful but so tiny and expensive for what you get. Queso is overrated as well - stuff out of the jar is better."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for Mexican food. As someone who was born in Mexico and raised eating Mexican food, nothing in the state of Ohio has resembled that. They have the sazón and touch of real Mexican flavors. Also, their service is excellent and the waiters truly respect the culture! I am deeply satisfied with my experience here. I strongly urge everyone to try this place and leave what think \"Mexican\" food is behind and open their taste buds to something new that has hit the city of Cleveland, comida mexicana!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing!!! I usually prefer to just get the short rib one because it's incredible, but I recently tried the shrimp as well, and OH MY GOSH IT WAS SO GOOD. I definitely want to continue to try the rest of the tacos in the future because I swear they get better and better every time I come. The salsa, queso, and bakersfield margarita are also some of my favorites.  The last few times I've come, I've had Kurt as a server, and he was so great! He remembered who I was and made sure to make my friends and I feel at home. He was also extremely knowledgeable about the menu and helped us to go out of our comfort zones a little bit to try some new things. I will definitely try to request him the next time I come back!"}
{"text":"So torn on how to rate this place... We love the food, fish tacos are great.  And the owner was great when our son fell off of one of the benches and hit his head.  He immediately checked on him and ran back to get him an ice pack.  But I'm not sure, after going 3x now, if we would go back with kids.  The hostess (I can't remember her name, but it was the same one all 3 times we went) gave us so much attitude and did not make us feel welcome at all, like we were an annoyance and how dare we bring kids... Sorry, but they have to eat too.  She wanted us to sit at a bar top table and have the high chair sit in the aisle, kind of nestled under the table.  My son is 1.5, has been eating everything we eat for about 10 months so there is so way that would have worked or he would have been happy with his head 3-ish ft below table height.  She got annoyed and rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could sit at a lower table so he could eat with us.  All in all, the food was great but you can get great food elsewhere without the attitude."}
{"text":"I love this place. The tacos are amazing and so are the margaritas. Great atmosphere too. I would highly reccommend Bakersfield to anyone looking for good tacos in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came in for a late night snack and some drinks and had an awesome time. Our server Dakota was very knowledgeable and fun, really making the experience great. The Milanesa torta and margaritas were both fantastic and I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating features...  Dora here. So, it's Superbowl Sunday and hubby decides he wants to go to Mert's. Mert's, right in the heart of downtown Charlotte! Granted, the Superbowl wasn't being played in Charlotte, but the downtown area was a hub of activity with local restaurants/bars offering special activities/prices for the event. Good thing I had a backup planned. After circling a few times and not finding a parking spot, we diverted to...  Bakersfield Tacos on East Blvd in the Dilworth neighborhood of Charlotte.   Dora here. Where we still ran into a parking dilemma. No private lot, not a street parking space for blocks, and plenty of signage nearby stating \"NO BAKERSFIELD.\" But, thankfully, only on Sundays, Berrybrook Farm allows Bakersfield patrons to park free in their lot. The server told us they have valet parking at night.  A local place serving up their own version of Mexican cuisine, Bakersfield offers both full size plates and petite tacos.   For our appetizer, we chose the Chips and Queso and added Chorizo. This queso was great, thick, gooey and with a little smoky flavor, but the star of this dish was the fried chorizo. Combined with the queso, it was the perfect match for the salty but hardy chips.  Dora here. The first thing that hit me about this was the smell. Amaaaazing! Cheesy, deep flavor, delicious! I could've made this a whole meal. I couldn't scoop this up fast enough! :)  For my lunch, I chose four different tacos: Fish, Pork Belly Pastor, Bistec, and Short Rib all served on in-house handmade tortillas.   The fish taco featured Mahi, lime sauce, citrus slaw, and cilantro. A great tasting taco with crispy fish and a crunch from the citrus slaw.   The pork belly pastor included chili marinated pork, pineapple, onion and cilantro. A sweet tasting taco that I just couldn't get enough of.   The short rib was my favorite. Tender braised short rib, queso fresco, crema (like sour cream), onion, radish, and cilantro combined for a perfect taco.   The Bistec, marinated short rib with a spicy chipotle slaw, had me reaching for my drink after every bite.  Dora here. I sampled a bite of all the tacos. Yowza! What an explosion of flavors! Since I'm not typically a huge fan of fish or pork, I was surprised at my top two faves: Pork Belly Pastor and Fish. By the time I made it to my Milanesa Torta, my mouth was on fire! In a good way. :)  Check out that tender white chicken breast! Mmmm. And I loved the fresh bread, a Telera Roll, \"similar to a French roll with a scored and flour-dusted crust.\"   Intense flavors as well, with a bold blend of black beans, salsa verde, avocado and lemon mayo, but I would've preferred half the pesto.  Eventually, we'll make it to Mert's. :)  What about you? How do you like your tacos?  Dora rated this restaurant a 4, but I rate it a 5. Since that equates to 4 1/2, we'll give them 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Been here on 2 different occasions. Excellent customer service, excellent drinks, amazing guacamole! Words don't do this place justice. Great vibe on the weekends, absolutely love it. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food is great and service is top notch. Probably one of the best taco places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!!! Garage doors are a welcomed change to this unit space. MAJOR UPGRADE from the previous restaurants here. Great service! Guacamole and queso was truly on point. They play football games on Saturdays. Margaritas were fresh squeezed and great. I hope they get flour tortillas here soon... Corn tortillas are just not our thing. We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Spicy margarita pitcher did not disappoint.  Amazing queso topped with pickled jalepeno, my first time trying pickled jalepeno and it's now a favorite.   Could be satisfied with the chips and guac/queso alone, but couldn't leave without trying some tacos. Tacos were good but chips and fresh dips/salsas were the highlight."}
{"text":"I first came across Bakersfield in Cincy. On that visit. I learned they were opening one in pgh that same week, oh the excitement. The pgh location is just as good as their flagship. The guac is AMAZING! The short rib taco ($4) is my taco of choice and the steak taco is take it or leave it.  Lunch service is also fast if you are on a time limit. Did I mention the guac is phenomenal?!?"}
{"text":"My love for Bakersfield is undying. I have been waiting forever to eat at the Cleveland location (since I previously fell in love with the restaurant in Cincinnati and then again in Pittsburgh). And Cleveland did not disappoint! I sat at the bar while I waited for my friend to arrive, and ordered a house margarita - super strong and delicious. The bartenders were super friendly and attentive. I was also pleased to see that they take reservations - I am not sure if that is something done at all Bakersfield restaurants across the board or not because the ones in Cincy and Pitt only used call ahead seating. So props for the reservations! Love it.   The garage doors were open onto the patio because it was such a nice night out, and we sat at a picnic table halfway in and halfway out of the restaurant. I started with the chips and black bean dip, which I think I devoured on my own. It was so delicious - probably should have ordered another one so my friend could have had some too (she did order her own salsa though, so she had something to snack on as well). Then came my favorite part - the most delicious sandwich ever - the Milanesa. This thing is seriously heaven on earth. AND - it's big enough to take for leftovers the next day. I am getting hungry now just thinking about it!   Basically - if you haven't gone to Bakersfield yet, what are you waiting for???? Get there ASAP."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. That is how much I like it here. I am trying to figure out when I can go back to Pittsburgh to eat here again, it is that good. I first ate at a Bakersfield in Cincinnati, and I did not connect the dots that it was the same place until I was actually in the Pittsburgh one. And I got way too excited. The black bean dip and queso is phenomenal. I can eat that stuff all day. The margaritas are refreshing and have just the right amount of alcohol. And I cannot get enough of the Milanesa torta - I got it on a whim in Cincy, and I have been obsessed ever since. It is the right combo of sweet and salty, crunchy chicken with a the soft bread. I am making myself hungry just thinking about it right now. I was surprised that there was barely any wait at the Penn Ave location - no complaints on my part because it meant that I didn't have to wait as long. But at the one in Cincy, we had to wait for more than 2 hours to get a seat.   Also, there is a bar in the basement, which is great if you want to get a drink where there is a little more room to spread out. Also, on the downside, I wish they made its NoWait app available to the public and just not the hostesses to put names in. Not enough to take away a star though."}
{"text":"Our second experience was much better and I'm so glad we decided to give Bakersfield another try. Do yourself a favor and get the pork belly pastor - it was absolute perfection. And the margaritas are as good as they say! Looking forward to going back and sampling the rest of the tacos that we didn't get to try."}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD! Service is eh. Last time I went, the server brought us an appetizer that we didn't order. As soon as we went to pick up a chip, she took it away from us! At that point, she should have just left it. We'd already touched it and it was their error in the first place."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal place. Great food and great ambience. This place alone convinced me that if I ever moved to Charlotte,  this area, Dilworth would be it. I absolutely recommend you to check this place out. Get their jalapeño margarita... It's awesome. Super like!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place from a to go order perspective. I ordered the Pollo Rojo, Short Rib, and Al Pastor tacos.. I also got the queso dip with chorizo and a side of guac cause that's how I roll.   Ok so the tacos were excellent, though I wouldn't get the Pollo Rojo again. I just wasn't feeling the flavor on that one. Order the queso dip with the chorizo just so you can say you tried it. I personally would not order again. It felt like a bucket list item. Get the guac!!!! It was sooo good. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A group of friends came to Bakersfield for a Saturday afternoon lunch. Our waitress was Dani. She was fabulous. In addition to our delicious margaritas, apps, and entrees, Dani was just absolutely on her A game. She gave us a few nighttime recommendations, along with other local favorites. She was extremely attentive and super sweet. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and fish tacos. Both were excellent. The atmosphere is really great too. The service is awesome. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. The service and food were really good. The tacos are amazing and so are the drinks. Get the chips and guacamole as an app! Glad I finally found a good Mexican restaurant in the Queen City!!"}
{"text":"For only being a week the experience was pretty solid. The space is really open and the community seating is something I enjoy. The guac was very good and a couple of their homemade salsas in the bottles were amazing I would buy them for the house. Of all the tacos most were good but the meats on the mole and short rib were severely dry. bringing all 4 peoples tacos on one tray and making them decide who ordered what is an awful idea as well."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how tasty the tacos are, how delicious the salsa is, how satisfying the drinks are, and how good the prices are if the STAFF SUCKS. Yes, dear manager and owner, that is enough to ruin any establishment. The waitress, Rachel, was unfriendly and rude until my gay friend showed up who she must have liked because then her attitude completely changed. So sorry if we weren't ready to order drinks and food the minute we sat down. And, whoever the absolutely rude hostess was everyone else made kick us out is completely unacceptable. I too am in the service industry and promise you being friendly with a group is going to get you way farther than being rude. Sure your line- \"we have another party for this table, like now\" said in the bitchiest possible tone is one way to get a party out but trying something like, \"I'm sorry we have another party that's been waiting 30 minutes for this table\" might be a better approach. I promise you my friends and I will never return and will certainly recommend one of your competitors (Tako or Condado) rather than ever steer anyone to this establishment. So, staff of the Bakersfield, work on your attitude or find a job where interacting and communicating with other people is not critical to the job. I also realize this is a chain and no one will likely care about this review, but with two other nearby competitors of the exact same nature, I urge you not to go here.   4/10: A follow-up to my review from Friday, 4/7. The manager, Charles, is outstanding and takes the customer experience seriously. I honestly expected no one to care much about my Yelp review but he reached out to me immediately to apologize. I will definitely give the Bakersfield another try as the food, drinks, and vibe were great and it is obvious from the manager's concern and follow-up with me that my experience is not the norm."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Charlotte. If that's not enough for you, the queso dip is to die for and the tacos are delicious! Fun and unique atmosphere. Always a good time!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with our first visit to Bakersfield on a lot of fronts, mostly the size and scale of the restaurant, and of the food. We went with a large party of 16 people, and while they have a lot of big tables available, it still wasn't big enough for our entire group as we crammed in.  The biggest surprise of the night was their group dinner special where $15 gets you guac, salsas, queso, chips, salad, and from what I could tell, unlimited tacos. The guacamole was wonderful, as were the presumably homemade chips. The salsa had a smokey chipotle flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of, but there was also a cilantro verde sauce that I enjoyed. Queso was unique with the best part being the peppers, black beans, and chorizo sitting on top.  Nice family-style salad, that I didn't eat a lot of as I was already getting full. When they brought out the trays of tacos, each had 1 pork with pineapple, chicken, beef, veggie, and fried fish. I tried all except the chicken and veggie - and the standout was certainly the pork with pineapple on top. Fried fish taco was also delicious but the slaw was veryyyyy salty.  Drinks aren't outrageously priced, and it's neat that they had such a large list of not only tequila, but whiskey.  The downsides from my first visit was first, the sound. Being Pittsburgh, trendy, and new, you of course have Edison bulbs, exposed brick, steel fixtures... and as is usually the case, it was very loud. I couldn't even hear the group on the other side of the table unfortunately.  And while the waitstaff that was bringing the food and drinks were great, our waiter in particular was pretty terrible, and he somehow had two huge parties he was waiting on. Being a taco and tequila restaurant I tried to order either Sangrita or a Mexican Mule, neither of which he had ever heard of. No big deal, and had I been able to ask the bartender they might've known what I was talking about. It was sort of interesting as they don't have many cocktails on the menu outside of the margarita and a spicy margarita that my wife enjoyed. Beer and liquor prices are reasonable though.  I'll definitely be back here for another visit, on first glance it doesn't beat out some other taco joints in Pittsburgh, but not by much."}
{"text":"I really wish I could've gotten (a little) drunk at this place. Tons of tequila and tacos that were small portion but quite delightful. Next time will come here first in the trip so I can sleep off the tequila hangover and spend a few hours munching on the food."}
{"text":"The margaritas and queso at Bakersfield were delicious. However, Barrio tacos are superior to Bakersfield tacos in my opinion. The next time I come, I'll be loading up on margs and queso and going to barrio after for some tacos :)"}
{"text":"Hello Loves!  I wanted to try this place since it opened so I went on a taco date! Recently tacos have become big business in Pittsburgh. Several places have popped up in the downtown corridor and this chain was supposed to be worthy of a visit.  I walk in and they are playing classic Johnny Cash! Amen! Secret outlaw country fan here! Shhh! Don't tell the hipsters!  Had a really great guacamole and then tried the fish taco, which was fine, not mind blowing by any means and the al pastor, I liked the pineapple chutney on that one.   Rhinegeist Bubbles Rose was my draft of choice and the waitress was right on with her suggestions. This hybrid cider was great. So great I was pleasantly toasted!  This place has stiff competition with Tako and Condado!   I suppose I'd give them another whirl!  Bye! Muah!"}
{"text":"Small chain of Mexican restaurants with locations around Ohio.  The tacos are small and there have been some days with long waits, but if you're on W25 and want Mexican food it's an okay option, but I prefer Barrio in Tremont"}
{"text":"Short rib taco, Mole taco, Bistec taco, chips and guacamole + margarita. What more do you want?!!?"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos with fresh soft tortillas that will make you come back for more! Atmosphere is friendly and service is great! Fish tacos are my go to with a sweet margarita for a relaxed Friday night!"}
{"text":"Wait time on a Saturday night was an hour and a half, which was way too long for $4 tacos! The tacos were nicely cooked - I had the carnitas taco on the specials menu and the bistec taco on the regular menu. However, the taste of the meat was overwhelmed by the amount of argula and veggies smattered on top. I would have preferred soft flour tacos rather than corn tacos, but that's just a preference. Service was consistently slow. Overall, an okay place but not something to stand in line for over an hour at."}
{"text":"Excellent taco restaurant that is new to Ohio city. I really like tacos that have a spice to it and I feel like most local taco restuarants are not up to par at delivering. The pulled pork taco with habanero sauce was delicious, perfect amount of heat to it. When I was there they were putting the finishing touches on the patio, which would be perfect for before or after a tribe game! Service could not be beat, really attentive!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place before. SO GOOD! Food was delicious, our waiter Tyler was very attentive, and I loved the atmosphere. Definitely worth going back!"}
{"text":"The tacos look good but they do not taste good. Just a place for chips and drinks if you ask me. Very friendly service though."}
{"text":"My tacos  were really delicious and my cocktail was bomb! Service was good and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Super good margaritas!! I had the spicy pineapple margarita. Well I had two. We did t eat but the food looked really good. Great service also!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nick makes a great margarita and Seth is one of their best servers. Great drink selection and love the apps!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back with a large group of Yelp Elite's for one of our informal meet-ups.  The group came away extremely impressed!  Service was accommodating and friendly, the inside is hip and full of energy with many different seating options available.  My wife and I both ordered Margaritas...I chose their \"standard\" version and she got the \"spicy\" one.  Mine was good, but hers was good-er (is that a real word?!?!?).  Seriously though, the kick from the peppers in her drink has inspired us to try the same thing at home.  Nicely done, Bakersfield!  Our (large) table decided to go along with the family style dinner option.  The \"Selecciones de la Casa\" is a great way for a large table to share and try many different menu items.  We started with chips and guacamole (big avocado chunks and tangy), salsa (one smoky and one salsa verde) and queso (black beans, chorizo and pickled jalapenos).  These dips came with endless (fresh and hot!) chips, so we were off to a great start.  Next was the salad course.  The Johnny salad was enormous with a very subtle cider vinaigrette dressing.  Truly, this was one of the largest salad plates I'd ever seen...and they will bring you as much as you want.  Lastly...on to the main course!  Their taco platters are served in groups of five (chef's choice) and ours had crispy mahi, pollo rojo, al pastor, short rib and hongos.  Each had a unique flavor combo / profile and because they'll bring as many as you want you can find your favorites and keep on going.  So much food and a fun atmosphere right on the edge of the main West 25th corridor.  Hope these guys can keep the vibe going!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I have ever experienced at a restaurant/bar!! Absolutely no tolerance for harassment!  We decided to go to Bakersfield last minute when we were downtown last night.  It was busy for a Thursday, so we just got a drink at the bar while we waited a reasonable time for a table.  While at the bar, we met two gentlemen.  They were nice and we got to talking as we killed time and sipped our drinks.  Our table was soon ready, and we followed the hostess downstairs where we were seated.  The bathrooms are also located downstairs, so when one of the men went to use the restroom he spotted us and came over to our table.  At this point the man was visibly intoxicated.  We were never uncomfortable, but being that he was drunk and we were not, he was very chatty and started to overstay his welcome.  Five minutes into the man standing at our table, I noticed many staff members (our server, another server, and the manager) make eye contact with me over the shoulder of the man and ask if we were okay.  The manager even approached the table at one point and asked, \"Is there anything I can get out of your way?\" even though we hadn't even touched our food yet.  I thought that was a very clever choice of words.  Eventually we were able to convince the man to leave and when I told Bree about the staff eye contact, I was told that they were doing to they were doing the same thing behind my back to her.  Bakersfield's no tolerance for harassment policy was amazing to see, and the fact that they all went out of their way to make sure we were okay was a breath of fresh air.  I have rarely had a bar-type atmosphere care, let alone go out of their way to make sure that I felt safe and comfortable.  The manager even came over after and apologized for our experience.  I would 10/10 recommend this place to my friends and family.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere is unique, and it was hands down some of the friendliest, best customer service I have ever received!!"}
{"text":"The chorizo dip offered here is my last meal on earth if I had to choose . That good. Loved the atmosphere and the fresh, delicious food options offered . Whether stopping in for a quick bite or a meal with friends.  You can not go wrong ! And pitchers of margaritas or sangria . Come on its no question.  I'm a huge fan of Bakersfield!!! I will stop here everytime i come to Pittsburgh for some out of the park Mexican food and superb Tequila collection !! Great service as well:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great atmosphere, food is so fresh and quick. Not only do you get great food but you get a great experience. Our server Kurt truly turned a simple meal into an experience! Definitely a must try in Pittsburgh. Check it out!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Bakersfield, I was so excited to try it. The reviews are great and everyone  has told me to go here. I'm sad to say I was very disappointed. The wait was almost an hour long and though I wasn't thrilled about that I was still ready to wait. Once seated we ordered chips , queso , and  salsa. They were all amazing. That's when I really started to get hype about the food. We ordered almost all the tacos on the menu and even a specialty of the night taco. That's when my experience really went downhill. The El Pastor was dry and flavorless. In fact all of them were. And the short rib the best of all of them was less than average. Which tells you how nasty the others were. I don't know how people give these tacos five star. Either the kitchen doesn't have their usual people . (Which it should considering it's a Friday night) Or people have lost their tastebuds. One thing I am impressed about is how this restaurant has lasted this long. Because I know some people couldn't have lost their tastebuds. So do yourself a favor and just go for the chips and queso. But frankly if it were me and it will be next time I'll just be at Sabor."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their spicy margaritas. It's a staple I get every time I go here. Not a huge fan of the tacos, but I would still eat them. Their chips and dip are a favorite, though!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype was. Their tacos were mediocre at best. They were cold and the pastor lacked the char flavor you expect. Their steak taco was way better. I enjoyed the margarita pitcher and the queso was easily the best part of the meal. Disappointed in the tacos, I would go somewhere else if that is your goal. If not, this place might be better for you than it was for me. Also, service was 3 stars because the waitress took a while to check back on us and I had to find her."}
{"text":"Tacos are great! Comes on giant pan with everyone else' taco. Flavors are great. Chips and salsa different.  The salsa is more like a sauce, than traditional salsa.  $3 shot of the day are great too!"}
{"text":"Truly wonderful experience.   The bar was crowded when we arrived, as sitting there would have been our preference. But no worries- they had a table for three available without a wait.   Picnic table seating was cool. Lots of room especially for three.   Ashley, our server was really good. She knew what she was talking about, was available when we needed her to be, but not annoying.   Food was great. We had the chips and guacamole to start. Chips seemed homemade and were wonderful. Guacamole was certainly homemade- a little spicy (I loved, the girls were less fond), creamy, delicious.   I ordered two tacos- a short rib and a bistec. Both were supreme.   Add the creme- totally worth the dollar. I also added habanero hot sauce- it was a little thin but really good.   Cocktails- they feature whiskey and tequila- I went with the former. Had a couple of old fashioneds- they weren't spectacular but good enough.   Overall I loved the place. Cool atmosphere, great drink selection and very good food.   I wouldn't try to go here as a family- but great for a night out with friends or as a couple."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  LOUD!!!!  Come prepared to talk loudly and listen hard!  The waitress did an excellent job attending to us and keeping us happy even while they were very busy.  Fun vibe and atmosphere - great hangout spot for the weekends.    Drinks:  Sangria is delicious but sweet.  You can get margaritas by the pitcher - and they are strong!!  Food:  Chips and Guacamole was pretty good - strong on the lime/citrus flavor, but in a good way.  Tacos!!!....$4 tacos!!  We had the Short Ribs, Fish, Pastor, Pollo Rojo and Huitlacoche Tacos and we liked them in that order."}
{"text":"Bakersfield has the best street tacos in Cleveland and is better than Barrio all around.   I have been visiting Bakersfield for years. When I was in college at Cincinnati it was one of the best restaurants in OTR. It became one of my favorite restaurants on High st in the Short North of Columbus when i was dating my future wife, and I waited what seemed like years for it to finally come to Ohio City. We were one of their first customers on opening night and it may be my favorite of the three locations I have visited. Sorry for the long story, but I say that to assert my Bakersfield bias and credibility.  Drink-wise, they are known for tequila and whiskey. They have a $3 shit of the day list. Their margaritas are strong and flavorful, and any if them can be made with a spicy rim for $1 more. But, my favorite drink is their red sangria. It is packed with fresh fruit and flavor.   Appetizer-wise, most people I know rave about their guacamole, but ibprefer the queso and chips with pickled jalapenos on the side. (Save some queso and penos for the tacos!). Youbreally cannot go wrong with either.  Meal-wise, all their tacos are a la cart and they have something for everybody. Fish tacos, short rib, al pastor, and a couple vegetarian options. Across all three locations I have been to, I find the huitlacoche which is this corn, pepper, onion, cheese taco of vegetarian deliciousness. The pollo rojo is my second favorite and is a braised chicken taco with queso, onion and chili salsa for an added kick.  They also have a seasonal menu that usually has one or two new taco creations.  If you want something that isn't a taco, the best option is a Tostada. They come on a large bed of lettuce, and are these crispy flat taco like boats stacked with delicious toppings. My favorite is the papas, which is similar to a brunch flavor with black beans, queso, and crispy potatoes. I do not know how to eat them without making a mess. I am told use a fork and knife, but the face first approach is what I favor.   They also have great craft beer, a great staff that loves their food as much as customers and a great mural on their outdoor patio.  Their chalk board on the sidewalk also delivers great laughs to the foot traffic. I can't stop saying great things about Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  The food was good... I didn't LOVE the chicken on the Willie salad... some pieces felt a bit rubbery, but everything else on the salad was delicious... their black beans are perfectly spiced, the queso dip is SO tasty with that just broiled crispy crust on top... YUM YUMMY!  I'll be back for a casual meal!  Small tip, please turn down the music a tad... we enjoyed it, but it made conversation difficult!"}
{"text":"When coming into town from Maryland, we hit this place first and often again before we leave.  Fantastic margaritas and food, wonderful service, and great atmosphere!  Definitely try the queso and short rib tostada.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great time with coworkers!  Excellent service and very delicious food. Best tacos ever!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Bakersfield. The atmosphere, drinks, food, and service are all spot on! Jaja was our server and she knocked it out of the park, answering every question we had and making sure we received our food and drink promptly. I had a fantastic cocktail, the Bakersfield version of a whiskey sour and there tacos (love the shrimp, mahi mahi, and steak.)"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch.  Service from Haley was very attentive. She gave us a fly-by of the menu, and she highlighted the most popular items. She checked in on us a few times to make sure everything was great. The mole chicken taco is freaking awesome, as is the Elote dip.  I am a sucker for good house-made mole, and this one delivered.  The guacamole had a nice lime zing, which I totally dig.  Great spot. I need to come back and tuck into a bourbon flight and one of their margaritas."}
{"text":"If your here for the tequila, it's totally worth it! The outside, inside seating is anther awesome thing about this place!    Otherwise, I'd forget about it! I've been here twice. The food was mediocre at best. Out of the three of us who ate here, we all left hungry and disappointed.   Btw. . . The tortillas are made of corn, not flour.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim because I didn't want the typical Mother's Day brunch buffet so many restaurants were having.  Had the queso and guacamole with our chips both were excellent and our main dishes which varied across the menu were all just as good.  Lauren our waitress was also wonderful and even one of the managers stopped and talked to us for a while.  Great service great food great time."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the Bakersfield margarita (one of the best I've ever had), the fish taco, and the short rib taco. Everything I've had is delicious and gets out pretty quickly, but be prepared for a wait on a busy night (Fridays and Saturdays usually). The staff is very nice and definitely helpful. The only drawback is how incredibly loud it gets, especially in the downstairs bar. Last time my date & I ended up just not talking while we ate because it was so difficult to hear. I think this would be helped a bit if the music were lowered a bit and the majority of the volume was from conversation. But it doesn't prevent me from going because the tacos really are so great. Whenever I call for a reservation I'm told they don't take them, but I do know they let you track your place on the list via Yelp, so maybe there's an option for a call-ahead spot of some sort (like NoWait). Not sure though."}
{"text":"The place is very nice and clean. The decor is in all woods which is cool. The staff is friendly. The guacamole is very delicious and sour. I liked the fish and shrimps tacos."}
{"text":"The margarita pitcher was amazing. The food choices for vegetarians is limited, but still good food. The quesadilla and the papas were really good. The food portion are quite small. Still recommend this place for everyone. Good ambiance as well. This place also has valet parking."}
{"text":"I've been in a lot of Tex-Mex places and this is by far one of the best ones. I tried the Regular margarita and it was on point, not sweet at all ( I can't stand sweet drinks) most places they sell you margaritas with 10000% sugar -not here. The food was great, it is limited but great selection.. I've had real tortas when I went on vacation couple of times in Mexico and they are almost like the real thing! Try carne asada torta by the way..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! The Papas tostada and their queso are delicious. Bakersfield has a fun lively atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. East Blvd in Dilworth has a lot of restaurants, but Bakersfield is definitely one of the best."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The Bistec Taco was, by far, the best taco I had. There is a teriyaki type glaze that is delicious.   The service was ok. Acceptable, but not amazing.  I will be back to enjoy this again."}
{"text":"Had to wait about a half hour for a table but once seated service was quick. Definitely order the chips and queso and the short rib taco, Delicious!"}
{"text":"We were walking along the street studying our YELP app and a local ask us what we were looking for.  We told him we wanted a great Margarita and he pointed out Bakersfield.  We probably would not have stopped in here had he not recommended it.  But we are sure glad that we did !!  Probably the best Margarita I have ever had !  My husband and had a jalapeño Margarita and although he said not the best ever , it was a good Margarita.  The menu is small and we didn't have any food.  Maybe we will come back tomorrow and try a taco or tostada.  We are in town for a conference.   It's a great little place."}
{"text":"I expected more from a place with such promising reviews, but honestly, I wasn't overly impressed. I came here for lunch when the restaurant had a handful of seated tables, but wasn't crowded by any means. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nowhere to be found, so it took some time to put our order in. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, but we were definitely hungry!  The chips and salsa were good, and I like that they give verde (green) salsa instead of the regular salsa. My tacos, however, weren't that great. I ordered the Pollo Rojo and Al Pastor Tacos and both of them were lukewarm at best and had soggy tortillas. The meat on each taco was flavorful, but the food temperature and soggy taco shells really threw off the taste. My coworker ordered the Willie salad and enjoyed it, so perhaps it's just that the tacos aren't the greatest. I would definitely return to try their Margaritas."}
{"text":"Great food, the Pork Belly tacos with pineapple was AMAZING. But the tortillas were sub-par and the service wasn't great. Our waiter was not as engaging with us since we were students and not old enough to order drinks."}
{"text":"Cydnie was our waitress and she was amazing!! She split our margarita because we didn't want to get day drunk. :) She was so kind that she gave us nachos and their salsa Verde for the road. It's people like her who elevate a dining experience. We loved this place - it has very cool vibe. Who knew this would be a Mexican place! The name is very misleading and perhaps intriguing too! Their tacos burst with flavors. The veggie one with mushrooms and Kale was amazing! We'd come back in a heartbeat for Cydnie, margaritas, and their tacos."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites! The price could be a little cheaper but I've never been let down by the service and food! I've probably tried every taco on the list with my favorites being the pollo rojo, fish, and short rib! The queso is amazing especially if you add black beans to it and the guacamole is everything! The sangria was great (not for those who love a super sweet sangria -- my boyfriend was not here for it) I loved it! They make it with Malbec and it's so good! Also the fresh lemonade is just enough tart and sweet ! Would fully recommend to anyone looking for some good Mexican food in the city!"}
{"text":"Interesting addition to East Blvd!  Hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area. The atmosphere is great, super casual but packed and lively. Everyone is here to have a good time.   The bar tables are ridiculous. The concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base, so you cannot sit under the table at all. You have to sit sideways at the table.  If I had waited an hour and a half to get that table, I would be pissed.  Fortunately, we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats.  Other than the grotesquely under-estimated wait time, the service was really good.  The tacos were interesting, but out of the four we tried I'm not sure I would eat any of them again. For me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.  The cheese dip is not your standard Mexican fare.  It has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get stringy and hard and cold.  The potato tostada was fantastic! Served in a cold iron skillet, with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad, it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells. Separated by beans and crispy potato cubes, it has a great balance of flavor and texture. The green sauce on the table adds a lot to it.    Definitely a good addition to the restaurant/bar scene."}
{"text":"Bakersfield was wonderful! The food was delicious and packed some heat! (If you are not a fan of spicy, this place wont burn your mouth off, but it does turn out some spice!) The servers were awesome. They were attentive and handled large groups as a team! (Shout out to CJ!). The mixed drinks were also made well served quickly. Overall, highly recommend this place for drinks out, dinner, and they are especially good at handling larger groups."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Fresh, flavorful, colorful. Best tacos in Cleveland. The margaritas are delicious and definitely deliver a nice punch. The ambiance is hip and welcoming. Service was prompt and friendly. Bakersfield is a must-visit."}
{"text":"Trendy young vibe with nice decor.  Expensive margaritas,  4.00 a la carte tacos, with good options.  Need at least three to get close to full.  Queso is amazing and since you must by chips it a good appetizer.  Lots of servers, so service was good."}
{"text":"Rachel the waitress is awesome! The food and drinks here are great - really delicious and fresh and the prices are super reasonable, especially for a downtown location! Rachel was great about making suggestions on the menu and split our checks without us even asking and had them all ready to go!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! A couple of the other trendy taco spots were super busy so walked over to Bakersfield. I was not disappointed. The margaritas were strong and tasty!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, but the service overall and the prices left a bit to be desired. I enjoyed the guacamole and the tacos, but I felt they were all pretty pricey. The tacos all came a la carte, and you have to pay for chips and salsa or other dips unlike at most Mexican style restaurants. The thing that was an excellent value was the margarita which gave a good price-to-size and price-to-quality ratio, and my fiance truly enjoyed it. The atmosphere was a bit Western, with Western movies on the TVs the entire time. Even on a fall Saturday with college football on, only westerns remained on the TV. The trouble with the service was on a Saturday night they were taking reservations only. Fortunately there were available seats at the bar, so we were able to eat without a wait. The bigger trouble with this, was that there were open tables the entire time that we we're there, and several people were turned away while tables remained unused the entire time. This seemed a bit confusing, and frustrating that there were always several open, unused tables. Overall I don't see it very likely that I would return. I'm not opposed to returning, but with all of the other options that are in the immediate proximity, this is a bit lower on the list of places to return."}
{"text":"Best tacos in this area! Seriously, guys. Go. Reasonably priced and a good selection. Do yourself a favor and get the fish taco!"}
{"text":"We arrived excited to try this place and the waitress was enthusiastic to begin with; the end result was disappointing. We ordered drinks and a bunch of food and then our waitress, who disappeared for the remainder of the meal which was problematic because she messed up our order, didn't bring us silverware, didn't provide us with the waters we asked for and I was left eating spicy tacos with no beverage. It was a busy night and she couldn't keep up - I get it, but bring in more servers when you know you are going to be busy.   The Drinks: We got a red sangria & a La Paloma - both were good, so at least we started out on a good note. We were feeling optimistic since there were no issues with the service so far and the drinks came out fast and were tasty.  The Starter Dishes: The guac & chips came out super fast but were seriously over salted and the guac had been made, I'm assuming, a couple hours in advanced and an entire lime was put into it to avoid it going brown. Or, at least, that's what it tasted like. We also ordered the papas - now if anyone here has been to Spain, papas are probably the most basic dish to make. All it consists of is fried potatoes and a mix of mayo & ketchup. What we received was an overly complicated dish that didn't resemble papas at all but a failed effort to provide a veg. dish that was extremely challenging to consume. Who puts fried potatoes on top of TWO large tortilla chips with beans in the middle and lettuce on the top and bottom of the dish? How are you supposed to consume that (especially because our waitress was missing for a good 30 minutes and we had no silverware)? Once we were able to track her down, even with a fork and knife it was a challenge to consume. So I can't really recommend either of these dishes to unsuspecting diners. I'm sure if we just stuck with chips & salsa we would have been happy.  The Main Dishes: We both ordered the same plate of tacos and only got one plate of tacos. So we started by sharing the first plate until they brought out the second plate (note we had to ask the person who brought our food, not our actual server because she was no where to be found at this point). I've had bigger issues at other restaurants and the tacos overall were decent, at least the pork ones. The beef one actually had a bone in it which was a rather unpleasant surprise. Not to mention, the meat was super dry so I would recommend to stay away from the beef. But, the pork tacos were the most redeeming part of the meal and our experience, they were perfect. Between the pork tacos & the drinks, they are the only reasons I'm giving a 3 star review...  But, overall, I would only recommend going to the bar at this place and maybe getting a pork taco or two. Nothing else was worthwhile for us and the service was a nightmare. You can find better tacos & drinks around the corner..."}
{"text":"So happy to see that Bakersfield has come to Pittsburgh!  The wait was 35 min for two on a Saturday night, but we just enjoyed drinks at the bar while we waited. The margaritas and cocktails are all awesome!  The real treasure, though, is the queso- TO DIE FOR.  I am still dreaming about it- creamy hot cheesy deliciousness.  The tacos are also all amazing, but small and pricey.  Overall, though, Bakersfield always guarantees a fun night!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience my first time here. However after revisiting this location several times after that first time, the place has come around on me. The service is great and the food has impressed."}
{"text":"I wish their pineapple margaritas were year around, they are simply the best. A perfect hint sweet with a little bit of spice. This should not be the only reason for going there, because their tacos and queso are just as fabulous.  This place is a prime example of Pittsburgh food culture."}
{"text":"This is a great taqueria in Cleveland. The Pineapple Margarita was off the hook!! Haley was a great server and made great recommendations. She was attentive and kind. The house salsa was cilantro heavy but for most it won't be a turn off (sorry to my wife though).  It is clear they use fresh ingredients!! The papas tostada is awesome. Even the kids chicken quesadilla was a big winner. It is close to the highway and easy to park! Big winner from someone traveling to Cleveland for a soccer game!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The hubby and I stopped in for a beer and some tacos and it was perfect for some fresh, just good food. We had their chips and guacamole, absolutely recommend and their tacos are a great price for trying a few. Great flavor! Michael was our server and he was awesome."}
{"text":"Bakersfield didn't feel like an authentic experience. The decor inside feels like they were trying too hard to be trendy, and the restaurant itself attracts an older, suburban crowd. Tacos were tiny but good, but you'll need a few to get full. The tostadas are a better bang for your buck if you're looking for something to fill you up. The best part was the queso! Delicious. Unfortunately if I had to choose between here and Barrio, I would choose Barrio."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. So much that Timmy Tom and I came here every Sunday for about 2 months. We thought it was becoming such a serious addiction that now we try to limit ourselves to bi-weekly visits.   Let's see, the place itself is very cool. I like the decor, the picnic tables, the huge bar, the johnny cash music, and the old west movies. Right away, it feels very homey.   Next, the food. TT has tried every taco, tostada, and torta, and is always happy with whatever he gets. As for me, two milanesa tortas just inst enough - I love them!! The milanesa chicken is always cooked perfectly and the avocado lemon mayo is so refreshing and tasty. They are the perfect size and I am basically ALWAYS craving them. When it comes to the tacos, short rib all the way. This has to be everyones favorite - its so juicy and tender - ugh, heaven! I have a little secret - I ask for the short rib torta as a tostada. Extra meat, crunchy taco, and a little lettuce - it's the perfect compliment to my two milanesa sandwiches!!   I think their margaritas are quite tasty and a bang for your buck. In fact, the whole menu is very well priced, in my opinion. I feel like we eat very well and don't walk out poor. I thought their limited menu would get boring quick but I was wrong. I am so happy this placed opened up and that its so close to me because if any place is going to become my 'Cheers,' it's Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out on my weekend.. They have good margaritas and I have to say , their tacos are pretty good, not a typical taco from mexico of course but it is a great southern taco if it makes sense? The atmosphere is great on the weekends! Try the steak torta as well. You will thank me later"}
{"text":"Came here for the tacos but I think their drinks were more of a seller. I ordered the pork and fish tacos ($4 each) and they were pretty small. Luckily my two friends ordered toastados, which were pretty big and filling so I was able to have a bite of both. The pork taco was a bit on the salty side but the pineapple cubes were a good touch. The fish taco was probably my favorite - not too salty or bland. We also ordered chips and queso with jalapeños. The ratio between chips and the queso wasn't even in that we had more chips left over but the queso was pretty good.   As for the drinks, I ordered their seasonal margarita which was the pineapple margarita and it was soooo good. I would definitely recommend coming soon for this one. My friend got the Bakersfield marg and another got a red sangria. I would say the pineapple marg was the best one out of the three, then the Bakersfield marg and then the sangria.   The atmosphere wasn't too packed, very chill, and just felt like a place for a nice girls night out."}
{"text":"Super nice surprise, 1st time there for lunch today.   Fresh salsa, & chips, all tacos were great.   Crispy mahi was the best to me.   My husband also liked the pineapple pork taco.    Ice tea was ice tea, not Peach, not sweet, or any other fruity garbage.   5 stars just for that.  Service was awesome and pleasant.  Loved the decor also.   Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday night for a birthday celebration and had a fantastic evening and dinner.  Glad we made reservations as we had a big party of 12 and this place was hoping!  Our table was not ready when we got there-no big deal but the manager came out and apologized and got us seated as quickly as they could. Our waiter was fantastic and quickly took our drink orders. I went with the red sangria which I highly recommend.  The cocktails are a bit pricey but the beer is reasonably priced. Since we had the larger group most of us went with the $15 special which comes with a sampling of appetizers and tacos. It is a great deal that I highly recommend for larger groups-you get a ton of food.  For starters we were brought out chips with queso, guacamole and two types of salsas.  Their red salsa has a pleasant smoky flavor that I was digging.  Also some of the best queso I have tried.  Next up we got their house salad which comes with bacon, onion, avocado and a fantastic dressing-I could not get enough. For our tacos they brought us out the veggie (grilled mushroom), fish, pork, and chicken.  I tried the chicken and pork which were fantastic all with fresh ingredients.  The veggie was not my favorite but what can I say I love the meats! The prices are reasonable with fresh ingredients and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really great guac and I love being able to order several small tacos so I can try different flavors. Ordered the fish taco, the carnitas, and the short rib taco. My favorite was the short rib, carnitas in last place. The have an extensive beer/drink menu but I don't drink. $19 for the whole meal - would return again!"}
{"text":"We ordered eight of the Al Pastor tacos through Postmates! Was a bit weary about the $4/tacos since you can get delicious tacos for $2 in CA, but it was awesome!!! The flavor profile was perfect. No extra sauce needed. The pineapple made it refreshing.  Just wished we could've sampled the other tacos. They didn't have fish taco or the mole taco available to order."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place while exploring the Queen city, no disappointments.  Its open till 2am, so its perfect for a late dinner. As appetizers, I shared the chips and queso and guacamole. Amazing. Our tacos were served timely in a big plate, which made it easier to share also. Our bartender Karl, made some of the best Margaritas we've had. Outstanding service by staff overall. The decoration is appealing. Good background music also :)"}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas. Got the summer special pineapple margarita. The server wasn't lying when he said it would be fresh and not in your face with the tequila. Delish! We started with the elote (street corn dip), it was perfect roasted street corn. The tacos don't look huge, but they are loaded. Two is good if you're not super hungry, three is plenty if you are. I got the shrimp, and the portabella. Both were outstanding. Hubs got pork, chicken, and short rib. The pork came with mango salsa and was perfectly sweet and spicy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early lunch on a Sunday and the tacos and margs were great! The guac there was awesome. Not soupy like a lot of places. The bartender also provided great service. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent place with some pretty tasty tacos! Delicious margaritas. Staff experience the few times we've been has been so-so, which is always disappointing. Overall pleased though and probably will be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, their selection of tacos is unique and creative. I would definitely get the fish taco again! Great service and their drinks look really good. Overall, a good experience at a good price!"}
{"text":"So, where to begin - chips and queso are delish with chorizo, jalapeños and black beans.  The beer selection is solid and the PBR in a glass cowboy boot makes everyone happy!    The handmade tortillas that accompany each taco were YUM and the taco selection is diverse and interesting - plan to try at least three, maybe four!  We tried the fish, mole, pollo rojo, pork belly pastor, cochinita pibil, bistec and the huitlacoche - look at the online menu for description but trust me on this - all were unique, perfectly prepared, fresh ingredients and so good, you'll want to try more  Two salsas come out, red and green.  The red was smoky - so good and the green was light, fresh - that cilantro flavor that I've come to love.  Both salsas are tasty, tied for the best!!  Loved both.  Rotating draft beers, Mexican sodas and delicious, generous margaritas round out this exceptional dining experience in the cultural district.  The servers, the waitress, and the hostess were all quite personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Tacos are out of this world! Staff was short a host and still gave quick service with a great attitude! I'm a long time server/bartender and I was wowed by this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with some friends on a Friday night after we had been downtown. We mainly came here because we wanted some tacos! I had the pollo rojo, which was delicious! The chipotle line crema really added to this wonderful taco! My friends had the hongos and fish tacos, that they also raved about. They are all on the smaller side, so I would recommend 2-3. My friend also has the mandarin Mexican Soda and she said she could drink that all night!  The only thing that was a little weird to us was we didn't get plates for our tacos. We ate them on napkins. But overall, I would recommend and I'd definitely go back to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Yelpers are here and they have a great special for groups of six or more only cost $15 for appetizers, entrees and salads.  Fast service is a premium!  It's called Selecciones de las casa and sounds delightful.  Started out with chips and three salsas.  Red mild,  red hot and green Mild.  Nice blend of flavors but not too spicy!   Also had the Queso appetizer  with black beans,  chorizo and jalapeños .  Taste was zesty with a zip!  The cheese was heated just right with a blend of spices.  We had the Johnnie Salad which had mixed greens, conjures cheese, hearts of palm, avocado, sweet onions, and toasted almonds drizzled in a cider vinaigrette.  Flavorful!!  We also  had taco combinations that included Fish a crispy Maha with Tabasco lime sauce, citrus slaw and cilantro.  My favorite was the short ribs!  Tender raised beef that is slow cooked for 12 hours in a queso fresco sauce, crema , onion, cilantro and a hint of cinnamon that left me craving more!  Also had a pork belly pastor taco that had chili marinated pork that was very tender, with white onion and cilantro.  All in all a good buy and very unique combinations!  Plan to go back again.  This restaurant  opened just two weeks ago and had a steady flow of customers!  Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps a victim of bad timing just after a trip home to California, the popular taqueria / bar has the interior and service that is buzzworthy, but the food fell flat for me.  Let's start with the name - Bakersfield. In the 70s & 80s it and Fresno vied for the unenviable title of the armpit of California. Perhaps it's had a big renaissance and is a hip unknown treasure unbeknownst to me, but even my friends from Central Valley chuckled that we had a restaurant named Bakersfield and thought maybe it was a bad omen.   The exterior is super hip with the wood-slat awnings, garage door windows and lack of tacky signage. The interior has a warm cozy feel with lots of unfinished reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs hanging everywhere and a busy stream of patrons.  They really nailed the feel of the place and I hope they stay for a long while in this seemingly cursed spot. Finding parking is not easy when the Valet lot and street parking is full, so hopefully they might strike a deal with another local business to borrow space after hours.   The service is impeccable - very very fast food delivery and attentive service.  If you wish, you could get in and out for dinner in 30-40 minutes if you don't have to wait for a table and you're not drinking cerveza out of their adorable boot shaped glasses.   But the menu...ugh. First, I've never been to a taqueria that didn't give free chips. C'mon folks. Jack up the cost of each taco by 1 buck and give us free chips already. The prices are reasonable, so just build it in. Second, if you don't want a taco, you are really limited to tostada or 2 different tortas. The sides are also quite limited. We did have the corn chowder which really sticks to the ribs- perhaps the cheesiest, thickest chowder I've ever had. It is fantastic with their chipotle salsa on top.   For the main attraction, los tacos, they have 8(ish) different choices- two different chickens (mole & cider braised), pastor (pork & pineapple), two different vegetarian choices, a fish (mahi) and braised short rib.  My choices were really limited because I'm allergic to cilantro, so I had the mole with pickled onions and mahi without the slaw. Hubs had mahi, braised short rib, other chicken and pork. The tortilla are house made. Honestly, none of the tacos sang for us. The short rib was particularly dry, the mole was more acidic than smooth mole-ish like you want it to be, the cider braise was way vinegary, and the pork was fine.  The mahi was the top choice for both of us, though only comes with one fish finger in the middle, so don't expect to fill up on 2. Honestly, Pinky's & Cabo Fish Taco have better more filling choices.     I saved my rant for the end, so feel free to tune out now. [Steps on soapbox] As I said, maybe it was just because two weeks ago I was in the SF Bay Area and had 2 stellar flavorful taco experiences (Tacolicious and Magdaluna), and this just paled in comparison, but I don't think so. If Charlotte wants to be taken seriously as a World-Class city, we better put our big girl pants on and get some world-class cuisine. Smaller Durham and Chapel Hill even seem to be outpacing us. There's no reason why this town can't have a really good taco place or good Chinese place, etc. There's nothing magical about Californian tacos. At this point you can pretty much get every single ingredient here as you can there, so they should be just as good. Tex mex places especially have gotten lazy (hear me, Picante, Vida and Maverick Rock Taco??) and think if you put any crap in a shell people will like it or eat it.  Maybe it's that most of these places don't have that Mexican heritage? I'm trying to reach for a good reason. And no, I'm not a haughty Californian- I've now been in Charlotte longer than the Bay Area, so I'm rooting for Charlotte to get better. Sometimes we all need a kick in the pants.   So, Bakersfield, sorry for the tangent, but if you want to get serious about having good food in addition to a cool bar, recruit the guy from Burrito Factory to come in to help you with your menu/sauces. Until then, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a go-to spot for my friends and me! It's my favorite place to eat in Pitt. The tacos are AMAZING and affordable ($4 or $2 after 10pm Sunday-Thursday) and it's my favorite place to get a pitcher of margaritas ($32 pitcher/$8 glass)! I recommend the Short Rib or the Baja Shrimp, but all of their tacos are great. If you're not into tacos, everything I've tried on the rest of the menu is fantastic as well. Whenever friends or family come to visit I always take them here! It's that good!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere is good if a little 'corporate'. They try so hard not to look like a chain style it makes them look like a chain to me.   I wasn't thrilled with the tortillas. No char on them just plain white flour tortillas with minimum cooking. That may have just been the day we were there.   I thought the food was good but I am with Ashley L that they are a little expensive. There were three of us and we had 8 tacos total and an appetizer and it came to $41 dollars for three of us...we had water. If we had 'Mexican cokes', at $3 dollars each, it would have been $50 for lunch without the tip.   I will go back to Bakersfield and recommended it to others."}
{"text":"I just expected better. I ordered multiple things and liked none of it. Everything either had a weird taste or was overpowered by cilantro. I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"This place could easily end up being 5 stars once they work kinks out.  Newly opened and completely slammed, but still pulling it off.  Great job guys.  There were a couple little hiccups, but all were quickly noticed by staff, no need for me to mention them.  I don't frequent the northeast much, so I've never been to one of these before.  With the garage doors open and the breeze strolling through this wonderful new bar, I think I've found my new spot to hangout in Dilworth.  Westerns on the TV, Johnny Cash playing loudly, and a $28 pitcher of a very drinkable margarita.  I'm in.  I just went for some guac and tacos.  The guacamole came out chunky and delicious.  Both salsas put the chips and guac over the top.  Then the tacos, oh how I love tacos.  The mole was superb.  Not necessarily traditional,  in the mole recipe or with the pickled onion, but it just worked.  By far my favorite.  The cochinita ended up coming in second, as it had great flavor, but just wasn't quite a complex in flavors.  While I love braised short ribs, that taco needs something else as well.  Maybe more white onion, or thicker slices of radish.  All I tasted was short rib.  The crispy mahi wasn't that crispy, and also didn't seem super fresh.  Says the guy who bought fish on a Monday.  Bourdain wouldn't do it, why should I?  All in all, its a trendy taco spot and southwestern style saloon that actually pulls it off instead of being cheesy.  I'm not saying the tacos are the best in Charlotte, but they are up there.  Being able to get full for a reasonable amount of cash in that part of town isn't the easiest to come by.  There beers are a little high, but they have a PBR special.  I'll be back soon and hope to notch this up one star."}
{"text":"We had reservations for a large group (bachelorette party) and had a great experience at Bakersfield. First off, I have to commend our waitress London. She was attentive, fun, and very sweet. She pointed our group in the direction of the selecciones de la casa which is a great option for large groups. It comes with chips with guacamole, salsas, and queso as well as a salad and a variety of tacos. More than enough to eat and plenty tasty! I definitely recommend Bakersfield for your large groups (make reservations), and if you happen to get London, then you're lucky."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is one of my favorite places downtown.  The queso, pollo rojo (x2) and bakersfield sour are my usual order and they never let me down. Seating upstairs can get tricky at happy hour, but a little persistence and keeping an eye on the bar can usual land us a couple of comfy seats front and center for a Western on the tv. My only knock is that when you are together, tacos come on the same platter. I have a dangerous shrimp allergy and my husband ordered it once and he had to take extra care to not cross contaminate"}
{"text":"Parking isn't great but we went on a Saturday afternoon and parked in a nearby parking lot and walked. It wasn't far. They have 2 great salsas and everything was good. We sampled several tacos and the chicken torta was fantastic. Chips and quest was great as well. I loved the ambiance."}
{"text":"Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey.   I knew this would be my kind of place! I met some girlfriends here for dinner and was instantly a fan of this place. Sure, parking sucks....but they do offer valet so that's a huge plus!  Based on the previous reviews I knew I had to start with a Bakersfield Margarita....and it was totally worth it. I loved that they come in mini mason jars and come with a good amount of tasty liquor. We also ordered some queso with chorizo.....holy cheesy goodness. It's delish. This is exactly how cheese dip should be done. Get it.   For dinner I tried the short rib taco which comes with queso fresco, onions and cilatro then gets topped with a radish. It was really tasty. My friends tried the fish and pastor tacos and agreed that they were all really good!  I also tried the Chicken Chorizo Tostado which was my favorite of the event and comes with black beans, chicken chorizo, salsa, queso on a tortilla over romaine lettuce. It was a small dish really packed with some amazing flavors. Make sure not to miss out on adding a pinch of lime juice!   There's plenty more tacos I want to try and I plan to enjoy that queso again, so I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We love this place! This time we got the sangria and a classic corona. The queso here is also amazing- second to none.  We actually just left Condado and walked here for an experience we know would be stellar. Highly recommended for a chill atmosphere, consistent food and great drinks.   Be prepared to wait if you're coming at night or a weekend!"}
{"text":"Meh....  It's okay.  It's one of those 'limited city' chains.  It wants to be hip, and it kind of is.  But, I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Best taco and margarita in CLE.  Big bar with lots of people watching.  Must have the queso with Chorizo and chips.  Pineapple margarita was amazing."}
{"text":"Our experience was great, will be coming back very soon!This place is barrio on steroids. VERY impressed"}
{"text":"Today I decided to give Bakersfield another try with my coworker in tow. We arrived promptly at noon and were greeted by a pleasant woman behind the hostess station. The restaurant itself wasn't quite crowded yet, which I attribute to the fact it was below zero outside because it definitely picked up during our meal. After we sat down, we were greeted by a perky waiter named Chris. He was upbeat and attentive to our needs. He also didn't disappear for long periods of time like the waitress I had during my prior visit.   Since we had a little bit of time, we opted to give the queso a second chance and I'm sure glad we did. It came out hot and had a gooey coating that melted and moved just as cheese should. It was quite glorious. Chris recommended a few items from the menu and my coworker actually selected Chris's favorite, the Milanesa, a chicken cutlet on a telera roll. The portion size was generous and the lime accented the dish in a creative way. I decided to try three different tacos. I ordered the bistec taco, the cochinita pibil, and the pork belly. The meat was cooked on the well side for the steak, which was fine because it wasn't overdone. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this one was some of the cabbage slaw was a bit too tough. The cochinita was spicy, but not so much so that I needed to gulp massive amounts of water. It also had pickled onions which were delicious and added a bit of sourness to the taco. Finally, the pork belly was something completely foreign, but made sense. I've never had pork belly before, so I don't really know how it should have been cooked, but I really liked the flavor profile when combined with the juicy pineapple. It was so savory!   Overall, I'm glad I decided to come back to Bakersfield. I was impressed by our diligent and personable waiter and really enjoyed the creative twist and flavor profile of the tacos I ordered. Additionally, my coworker's fiancé loves tacos and he found a new place to bing her!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Really fun, casual vibe. Killer margaritas and really good food. I've been there twice and it was really good both times. From the hostess to the manager, everyone was great. Our server, Beans was bomb.com. Not only did she really take care of us, but she was just super fun to be around. Thanks for chaperoning my sister Beans! ;)"}
{"text":"Omg I came in on friday afternoon with my son and husband and had a blast the best restaurant experience ive had in a long time the food was amazing and the drinks were phenomenal and we had a kick A$$ Server named Haley she made our visit absolutely fantastic we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Bakersfield.. a hipster taco joint off of East Blvd. A must-visit if you haven't been there. Seems like a cool hang-out spot.   LOCATION East Blvd, crap parking (seriously, don't come here with a car).  AMBIANCE Hipster, lots of wood, garage-door windows. There are high-top seating, booth seating, as well as bench-style seating. The light bulbs are inside of wisks. How cool is that! There are a few tvs here that play some of the bigger games that are on. Not a sports bar though.   FOOD Guac and chips - Guac is chunky. Super chunky. Very limey and topped with radishes. The chips were really good - thin and really light. They were lightly salted and slightly limey.   Tacos - pretty expensive but yummy. The portions are small so be prepared. The toppings aren't always typical but just trust Bakersfield.. they know what they're doing.   Tostada - super yummy. If this is your first time, we recommend the one with chicken and mole. It is delicious! It feels like eating a lightly dressed salad topped with super delicious shredded chicken layered with crispy tostada.   We haven't checked out their bar just yet.. so we'll update the review once we do!"}
{"text":"GREAT tacos and tequila!  Staff is friendly, hospitable - and quirky.  Management is excellent.  The let the staff's individual personalities shine, rather than quashing them into a corporate mold.  This is one chain restaurant that gets it right."}
{"text":"Neat environment for a drink, and a good Margarita made it worth the trip. Disappointed in the poor chips and salsa and very small tacos"}
{"text":"I've had some strong happy hours here with work colleagues.  Will sign-off on the guac, queso, and the PBR that comes in a boot glass + cheap whiskey shot combo.  Did real cowboys ever drink out of boot glasses?"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch yesterday on the way to shopping at the strip. Some of the surrounding spots don't open for lunch on Saturday , but if you are in or near town, you will be glad that Bakersfield does. I have been there several times previously, during week hours, and wanted to bring my family.  We were greeted and seated by our friendly and competent waiter 'Chris', who provided stellar service throughout the meal.  Our table ordered chips and guacamole to start. Guac was super fresh and very tasty. Next came the meal. Bakersfield tacos are small, but priced accordingly which is great because you can try a variety. I had a fish and also a pollo taco, both were outstanding - very fresh and delicious. My wife and I also tried some soup for the first time. It was called Pozole, and I highly recommend it. It had braised pork, chicken, In a tomatillo broth with hominy dumplings. Complex and tasty flavors.  Atomsphere at Bakersfield is also nice. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. Lots of liquor offerings and music was pleasant.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yum! Loved this place after hearing about it for a while! The food was great. I'd love to give 5 stars for the overall experience but the service was a bit slow, and the bathrooms were out of TP and paper towels. Not the biggest deal but distinguishes a 5 star across the Board.  My husband and i split 4 tacos- the mahi, pollo rojo, pork belly and steamed bun. The pollo rojo was by farrrr my favorite. With quest fresco, white onion and a lime sauce, you can't go wrong and the chicken is shredded, so easy to eat in taco form. Everything about this taco was perfect. Next time, I'm ordering three of them. The pork belly with pineapple was also pretty amazing. The pork had a chili marinade glaze which really beefed up the flavor 10 fold. The 4 inch tortillas are homemade and very yummy! Taco prices are reasonable; $4 each and $3 for a vegetarian one. We also had the Breckinridge agave wheat beer, to help wash down the tacos. Delicious. They have a few rotating taps but most of their craft beer come on bottles/cans, but have a great selection of locals with noda, birdsong and triple C.  Unfortunately, they don't give complimentary chips and salsa like typical Mexican places.   Will definitely be back here. Love the atmosphere and the garage doors that open up the outside. Beautiful wooden central bar. Bring your peeps and enjoy the pitcher margs and some yummy tacos!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and ambiance. Their queso is absolutely the best I've ever had. Even better topped with chorizo and black beans. Also an excellent selection of tacos. The drinks come in mason jars and are also very good. Service was prompt and I noticed the manager taking the time to visit each table to speak with customers about their experience. I will definitely be going back. Awesome location too."}
{"text":"Arrived in the evening on a Sunday night. There were a handful of tables available, the bar was busy, but we were seated quickly.   After that it went downhill. We waited well over 20 minutes for anyone to come over to help us; and even then, we had to flag someone down which took a few tries. Apparently the person who was supposed to be waiting our table was super busy and never showed up, so someone else took care of us after that.   Once we were able to order, everything else seemed to go smoothly.   Taco sizes are on the smaller side, so keep that in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"Always a great night! Bakersfield's house margarita is awesome and the tacos are some of the best around. Great ambiance and excellent service"}
{"text":"Remember when you went to that one little Mexican restaurant and had those Margs and Tacos you remember being so damn good? Well, you're about to rediscover both of those items made with fresh, high quality ingredients. The spicy marg is the way to go, with fresh lime and jalapeños infused in the wonderful tequila concoction. If that isn't good enough for you, pair it with the chips and fresh salsas and guacamole. And to top it all off, DEFINITELY order the fish and bistec tacos. With a squeeze of verde salsa, you will think you died and went to taco heaven. Only at Condado in Columbus have I had tacos that matched the quality and full flavor of Bakersfield. Go. And order an extra fish taco for me- I'll be there."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of Bakersfield before going so I feel like I had a pretty good idea of what the vibe was.  in keeping with the Old Western theme of the place, we will go with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  The good:  the interior is really cool- lots of wood with concrete counters to set your drink on in the bar area.  Our table was in the bar area and our service was good.  We started with queso and added the jalapeños.  It was very good!  I also had the corn chowder (it was pretty good), the Pollo Rojo taco (again, pretty good), and the short rib taco (very tasty).  It is a little weird that your order is served all together on a tray with your entire party's order.  They call it \"family style\".  It's just odd.  The bad:  The noise!  I've been to loud restaurants, but this takes it to a whole different level.  I'm talking night club music blaring loud.  They play the music so loud that everyone has to talk really loud to hear each other, which just adds to the noise issue.  Our server could not hear us even when she was right next to us.  There is no reason in has to be so loud to the point that you can't hear each other.  The ugly:  the price of their \"premium\" margarita.  At $13.00 a drink, I've had better.  I would probably give this place 3 stars, but because of the noise level, I'm not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Tacos were quite good- but expensive at $4 each (with no side included like most Mexican places) you. Certainly need more than 1- most of the ladies ordered 2 and the guys 4. I tried the steak which was spicy but really good and the pork belly which was really bland.Don't waste your money on the Marquita's- the top shelf was $52 that only served 6 (per the waitress) and they were very small glasses."}
{"text":"Great guac and chips!!! I loved the pork belly taco. So so yummy. Great atmosphere and good service. I sat at the bar and our server was very attentive. I will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly busy. The nachos come with some interesting salsas and the margaritas were tasty.  I had a tortilla soup and a chorizo taco, both were good."}
{"text":"I had never been to Longboards, or whatever ill-fated establishment failed in the location prior, but watching the renovations unfold from the street piqued my interest.   The space is well decorated with a vintage western vibe - garage door windows, antiques light fixtures, and distressed wood textures.  Started with the queso loaded with jalapeños, beans and chorizos to start. It was delicious. Beautiful, indulgent, cheesy deliciousness. Maybe the best queso I've ever had.  Side note: $2 PBRs everyday in a glass boot - if that's your kind of thing.  Ordered the mole and raja tacos. Enjoyed both, but they were a little smaller and not as stuffed as I had expected? Maybe they're bigger for dinner? I also enjoyed the few bites I had of the chicken chorizo tostada and will likely order that if I return.  Maybe not the \"authentic Mexican street fare\" like they claim, but if anything, go for the queso!"}
{"text":"I had been craving some kind of comfort food while I was on a busy trip for work. I had wandered around on my way back to my hotel, but hadn't found anything that quite fit what I was looking for (and that looked like a comfortable place for a pretty casually dressed solo female, fresh from a long drive, to just pop in to).   I was getting hungry and relieved to happen upon Bakersfield. It looked busy enough to not be creepy, but not so crowded that I wouldn't be able get fed for a long time. When I came in, I asked for recommendations on seating and ended up heading off to sit at the bar in the downstairs area.   The bartender was helpful and quickly got me situated with some water and a beer. We discussed how neither of us were big on beers, but ended up coming up with something that we thought I'd like (her recommendation was great).   I ordered the chicken torta and happily consumed every ounce. It was delicious and exactly what I had wanted, despite not having a firm grasp of what I was craving when I entered the establishment. Thanks, Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"First things first.. they are always busy so make sure you have time to wait, it IS worth it.  (avg. 30-45 min wait time during busy hours). Their red salsa is earth shattering, it's magic, it's delicious, it's smoky, it's LIFE. That green salsa? It's tangy, it's cilantro, it's fresh tasting, and it's divine. The chips are house made, and warm, lightly salted crunchy perfection. I purchased the brisket taco and the pork belly taco. I can't begin to describe what a fiesta my mouth was having with both. Perfect amount of sauce, perfect seasoning on the meat. JUST PERFECT.  My co-pilot for the evening got 2 fish tacos which she demolished in a the blink of an eye. I would have asked if they were good but my mouth was having a sexual experience masticating my own tacos. We locked eyes across the table and both nodded.  The margaritas are great, Bakersfield Margarita is awesome... get a whole pitcher, you won't regret this. $3.00 PBR pounders all day everyday. Every day theres a tequila special.   Seriously, if you haven't been to Bakersfield you need to get on it. It's not true mexican, but would you expect it to be? It's good, it's reasonably priced, and you won't regret it. They aren't striving for that true mexican vibe, they play all types of music, the staff is young and hip, they hit the mark all the way."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot! We came with a big group and they couldn't have been nicer. Tried to make a reservation a few times before we got in, but there were some issues with the reservation system. The manager came over and apologized for the error and we were seated within 30-45 minutes of our initial reservation. They also provided complimentary queso and salsas which was appreciated!  The tacos were fabulous. The spicy margarita was awesome. We also loved the queso and guac. The chips were very salty, but that may be our only complaint. Fun new spot!"}
{"text":"The  guac is amazing, and tacos are extraordinary!!!! #1 place in CLT! My coworker and I went there last Friday and had a great time. I love the fish taco and steak one! Best tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Heart of downtown PGH and did not disappoint. First atmosphere was great staff was exceptional. Very clean for a bar. Tacos were exceptional. The steak was. A little crispy but was still fantastic. The guac and chips we're devoured along with the squeeze bottles of salsa. I may oray not have squirted them straight in the mouth. So tasty and good balance of flavor and heat. The platter of tacos is great as a group but don't plan on sharing. After the first bite you won't want to share."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas and tacos to go around. Had chips and queso/guac as an appetizer with multiple friends and had plenty of food."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from many different people, I decided to try it out for lunch today. The atmosphere is really loud and modern. I liked it and it was very inviting from the decoration to the dishware. We started with the queso with chorizo. It was so good!!   Tacos: Fish- solid fish taco, wish the fish was crispier. Way too much slaw Short Rib-PERFECTION. I wish I had gotten all short rib tacos. Pastor- did not care for this one at all. Way too much pineapple that it was overpowering  The tortillas tasted good. My only real disappointment was the service. Our waitress was really slow to tend to our needs. She didnt come back for a really long time to provide refills or allow us to order. I wish she would have told me lemonade was not free refills when asking if I wanted another one. If I had known  that, I would have gotten a water towards the end of my meal not a $3 lemonade I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"I was sadden when I was unable to not come here for my latest visit to Pgh! Amazing food with great drinks! Next visit to Pittsburgh I will be there for sure!!! Great bartenders and staff and amazing food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the place was pretty busy.  The tacos are the way to go here. The spicy mahi was the best!"}
{"text":"Best food ever!! Great value and wonderful for a big group! Tyler was a fantastic server! He was very attentive and organized! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. JaJa made our night. Best margs and guac I've had in Cleveland yet!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! This is not a typical Mexican or taco place. It's more of a California twist. We had the chicken Milanese sandwich and the short rib sandwich. They both were a lot of food and had amazing flavor!  I can't forget to mention the app- we had the queso with chorizo and jalapeños. It was the best queso I've had recently! Their chips are good too.   The inside is really nice, there are garage doors that roll up, so will be really nice this spring! Great bar set up too. Drinks looked good, but we didn't try any. One note, it is really loud. They could turn the music down a notch. (We are younger with no kids and thought it was loud).   The only other minus is the parking set up. Very hard to find a spot and the spaces that were open specifically said they were not for Bakersfield parking. Hopefully they can get that worked out! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic guacamole! Great service and wonderful atmosphere! The selection of whiskeys and tequila is far above the average. This the one of the best places to go and just relax and take it easy for a few."}
{"text":"Affordable yet delicious tacos and drinks? Count me in!  Rustic and trendy vibe. I visited for a friend's 21st of 7 people. They usually only take reservations if it's a group of 10+. Our server Lindsey, treated us SO WELL! I hope she gets to see this, because she made our experience a great one. I think my friend had such a great birthday here. They even treated us to a birthday shot from their shot of the day (which was whiskey) since they don't sing happy birthday here apparently?? (Sorry we didn't drink it, our friend wasn't feeling shots from the night before. Appreciate it tho!!) Taco sizes aren't too small but also not too big, and I got decently full from two but also I stuffed myself with chips..  CHIPS AND GUAC ($8?): Their chips are so addicting. I kept eating even after I finished my tacos.. Omg. Their other salsas are soooo good too! I think the brown one was habanero but my friends kept joking saying it tasted like barbeque. BISTEC TACO ($4): Very sweet. Not sure if I'd order again, but it was still really tasty! FISH TACO ($4): Fresh cole slaw and crispy tacos. Omnomnom. RED SANGRIA PITCHER ($36): Wowow. So tasty and refreshing! For a party of 7, the pitcher was plenty and such a great deal. The last time I was here, we had ordered their Bakersfield margarita which was also yummy, but a bit strong for my tastes.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fun date night if you love yummy tacos and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty although the portions were a little on the small side for the price. We sampled both the tacos and the tostada. I really love the updated decor and atmosphere. The biggest disappointment was the queso dip - the texture was kind of lumpy and it was a little too sweet for my taste. I also prefer fresh jalapeños to pickled ones."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 8:30 pm and there was a 1 hour and 45 min wait! The hostess gave us the tip to go hang out at their downstairs bar but that was jam packed too! FYI, you can order food there too but we had no luck even finding a spot to stand. So we left.   Came back the next day at around 4:30 pm and there was no wait. Score! However, with all the hype, I was a little disappointed. The hubby and I ordered the chips and queso and all tacos: bistec, fish, short rib and pork belly pastor. The queso had a gooey topping but the rest was a ricotta cheese-like texture which I'm more a fan of smoother queso. Flavor was there, but I just didn't like the texture. In terms of the tacos, I've definitely have had better tacos for both less money and more money. Bakersfield's tacos were quite bland and did not blow me away. If I had to pick a favorite of the ones we ordered, I would pick the bistec which had a bit of spice. The pork belly was pretty tough to chew on, despite it being a fattier cut of pork. The others just didn't stand out to me. One thing to note is they do bring out two bottles of their salsas: their verde (fresh, yet creamy) and their rojo (spicy and smoky). The salsas add a bit of flavor to the tacos and they are in handy squeeze bottles, making them easy to pour on your tacos.   I most likely will not come back for the food here, but rather their drinks. They have an extensive tequila and whiskey menu. The atmosphere is so hip and new so it's definitely a fun environment for cocktails!"}
{"text":"Ok nice bartenders and service people, tacos are average, salad the highlight, I would come back for a drink but pass on dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with friends! The drinks are great and the food has never disappointed. They are great working with people with gluten intolerance (I could order almost anything on the menu). Costs are reasonable too."}
{"text":"So great we have been twice.  Guacamole was exceptional and the assortment tacos had us keep trying different ones.  Mackenzie took great care of us!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos. Queso dip was not our taste. Tasted over cooked and reminded me of expired milk. I remember the pork belly tacos were my favorite. The tacos also come on a nice platter stand."}
{"text":"The tacos here are awesome. I have loved everyone I tried except for the vegetarian option, but only because it was too spicy for me. The house margarita is great, and not super expensive. If you are going with a large group, I would suggest the group dinner special where you get guac, salsa, queso, salad, and a TON of tacos. It's a great way to try something you might not necessarily order on your own, and you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Oh what a treat. My chicken chorizo tostado was amazing and a meal by it self.  The fish taco was the best out of the 5 I sampled. The margaritas especially the premium was great. Give them a try. I like the additional options offered here & not with their competitors."}
{"text":"Our monthly girls night out dinner was held at Bakersfield tonight.   Try the chips and queso or chips and guac to start - incredible. The chips are super salty (my favorite) and they give you plenty plus two types of salsas (the green one is my favorite!)   They always have a special taco. Tonight the special taco was chicken with some type of peanut topping so that leaves me out. No worries, I just like to look at the special menu. It has a special margarita too. Tonight it's grapefruit.   I ordered a glass of sangria. Amazing! It's a sweet red wine with lots of fruit (think apples and blackberries). It's served in a mason jar so portion is perfect. The glass is priced at $8. I drink a lot of sangria so that's reasonably priced for a drink not on happy hour pricing in the city.   For dinner is usually order the chicken tacos. If you order tacos with a group they come out on a large pizza tray - so cool. Tonight I tried something different - the chicken chorizo tostada. I highly recommend it. The portion size is perfect and the price is great. Tasty and filling.   This place is perfect for lunch, dinner or a few drinks. It has a chic urban feel with two dining areas - one upstairs where you walk in the main doors and on downstairs so do not be discouraged if it looks full when you first enter. The staff is friendly and always full of great recommendations. Make sure you try a signature margarita if you are a first timer!"}
{"text":"Best fresh guac and chips anywhere! Excellent margaritas! Vibrant evening scene, and lots of space to spread out at the bars (upstairs & downstairs). LOVE!"}
{"text":"Loved the chips & guac. Chips were warm, which was a pleasant surprise. I tried a Rose sangria. Sounded yummy but it was a little too sweet for my taste and didn't have enough taste of alcohol. Tacos were decent as well."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with the decor and the whole look/feel of the restaurant. From the mason jars, the wooden walls, opened garage doors to let in that beautiful 72 degree weather and a John Wayne movie in the background.  *Food wise: I highly recommend the pastor and short rib! Whatever fish they used for the tacos tasted kinda cheap. Their guacamole had lots of lime in it and was way too chunky (looked like they half-assed putting it together... a little cilantro, maybe?)  *Service: Slow. It took forever to order and get our waitress' attention. I asked for a water AND a coke right away but she gave me the water halfway through my food. It also took forever to get the check after! It was already 9pm and I was suppose to leave to drive back to Atlanta after dinner.  I'll give this place another shot since according to my friends, it's the new hotspot. Until next time, Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Sooo good.... love this place first time is not the last.. gotta come here the tacos are great"}
{"text":"When they tell you the conchinita tacos are hot they are not lying.  These are Man vs Food HOT but delicious.  All the tacos I had were very good.  The fish were fried just right, the short ribs and mole were both very juicy.  Would definitely return... But will probably stay away from the conchinita myself."}
{"text":"Bartender service in this place is a joke. Came in at 845 on a thursday, place wasnt packed. 45 mins later 1 drink, and no bartenders to be found. Ill go somewhere else next time i'm on a date."}
{"text":"This is a great place I just can't get enough of. It's always got a good crowd whether you only want a drink or food too. The tacos are good and the menu is small but I highly recommend the chicken chorizo tostadas...I get it every time and it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte since college. Someone recommended this place for taco Tuesdays so I came out with a coworker. I'm impressed by their tequila selection I must say that. Didn't stay long on Tuesday because they didn't have any basketball games on. Thanks to Brian the owner I returned on Thursday night and had a delightful time! The food is AMAZING! The staff certainly knows their tequila as well. They even had the UNC vs Duke game on and even though they aren't a \"sports bar\" it was a great atmosphere. Nobody was there screaming or acting wild, everyone was calm. Hopefully that influences them to play sports a little more often. But this is a MUST VISIT when in charlotte!!!! Free parking garage beside the restaurant. Can't say enough about how much I had a good time tonight!!!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! These are the best margarita's in Charlotte BY FAR. No mix, just tequila and lime. Absolutely amazing. Also, there is a full  menu of tequila, and whiskey, with available flights to order. Plenty of variety for whisky and tequila lovers alike.   Despite the drinks, the food is to die for! Fresh and flavorful ingredients, unique and vibrant flavors: makes for an unforgettable meal."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour spot. Popular and packed on weekends. The tacos / tostadas are fresh and delicious. Margaritas are well portioned and affordable. A very hipster / millennial atmosphere and friendly service round out the Bakersfield offerings."}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying Bakersfield. It's a place that has been recommended so many times so I had high expectations. First off parking is difficult and surrounding places make it known that it is not Bakersfield parking so I was paranoid I was going to get towed. For a place that sells tacos and going on a Tuesday I expected some specials? Anyways, our waitress was not friendly at all. Drinks weren't refilled-- she did less than the bare minimum. Which honestly, sucks because I feel like if the service would have been different it may have improved the experience. We started with chips and queso. The queso is really thick but decent. I ordered 2 tacos, but for $4 each!!!!! To me, that personally is too much for something not authentic.  The tacos were good but not great.  I just expected more since this place has such good reviews and I was recommended this place by friends."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we went to Bakersfield because Tako was packed, shame on me. This place is an amazing taco joint in its own right. Tacos were on the smaller side, but tasty. We sat at a shared table, but it wasn't too bad. There was another table that was super loud and rowdy... Not sure why they didn't kick them out.   Overall good food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"So, 4th time here and I finally decided to try some tacos.  I gotta say, they might be small but they sure are good.  I got the Pollo Rojo and Pork Belly tacos.  Both were good but the Pork Belly tacos stood out, they nailed it.  $4 a taco..not the best price but these aren't your run-of-the mill tacos.  Added Chips and Guac for $7, LOADS of guac with avocado chunks throughout.  Most places skip on the guacamole, but for $7 you get an impressive amount.    I think I'll keep this place in mind for when I'm looking for a quick bite or want to munch on some chips and grab a beer with friends.  Much the same as my last review, the staff are super nice.  Our waiter today was very attentive and the bartender (I sat and had some drinks at the bar before dinner) was very polite an talkative with my group.  I'll continue to patronize this place simply due to feeling welcome."}
{"text":"This is a nice place but parking can be a challenge.  I went here on a Tuesday night after 10pm when they have $2 Tacos. They have some nice Tv's in here but on this night they had the tv's turned to some John Wayne B.S. it's 2017 who watches that still? I didn't ask them to change it cause I was there for the tacos and then I left. The service was ok, it could've been better considering there wasn't many ppl in there that night. I had 4 fish tacos and they were good but I know to ask for more sour cream next time. I would return again but it's nothing I'm in a rush to get back to."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. I ordered the chips and queso, fish taco and hongos taco. The queso dip was really good, the fish taco was good but I have definitely had better and my hongos taco didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked. The service however was excellent. If I go back I will be trying something different since I didn't love the tacos.  Well what you see above is my review from 2 months ago. I went back for lunch today and liked my order much better. I ordered the chicken chorizo tostada and my husband ordered the short rib torta. Both were really good. I of course had to order the queso dip again since I liked it so much the first time. Service was still just as good."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty good. We had like 5 different kinds from their menu. A single taco is small-medium in size and costs $4. Three Tacos and a beer or two will fill up most people. Liked the beers. It's a noisy bar, as most others."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and had to wait a bit, but they use the yelp waitlist, so you can always check on your place in line. We were able to get margaritas while we waited, and it wasn't too crowded to wait. The margarita was amazing. One of the better margaritas I've had in the area.   We got queso with chorizo, which was all right. I've had better queso, but it was still good. We just wanted to try something before our tacos. But, the queso came at the same time as tacos. I thought we'd get it to start, and now have all of the food brought at once. It might have felt a little less rushed to get the queso as an appetizer.  Tacos were good. Not the best tacos, but really affordable and flavorful. The al pastor had so much pineapple, maybe a little too much, but still had a good amount of meat. I loved the short rib tacos the most. Definitely really moist and flavorful, and delicious. I also got the pineapple margarita with my tacos, and that wasn't as good as the regular margarita, but was less acidic, which is a good thing.   I wish they had a happy hour, but the environment was great, service was quick, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco joint in Charlotte. I go in every other Sunday to get my fix. The pork belly pastor is unreal and the guacamole they have is the best in Charlotte. Great atmosphere to grab a drink before heading out, especially when it's nice out and they have the garage doors open. From my experiences the staff has been extremely friendly. Last Sunday we had a tall guy with brown hair as our waiter, his name might have been Steven (he looked European). He was very knowledgeable about that menu and specifically the drinks. Would definitely recommend this place to those of you who haven't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Zero complaints.  Thursday night.  We sat right away.  Phenomenal selection of whiskey.  The service was good.  We ordered every taco on the menu and it was all good.  If you are a grown man and wondering how much to eat.... 4 tacos if you're normal hungry.  5 if you are really hungry.  Girls you can probably crush 3 easy."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great service. When I went they were out of chicken, which was disappointing because i heard great things about their chicken tacos but i guess its just an excuse to go back! My friends and I split the queso and I ordered 2 chicken tacos. The tacos are small, something to keep in mind. The margaritas are honestly one of the best I've tried so its worth the price."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday lunch this past Tuesday with my daughter and granddaughter after seeing their segment on Fox eight was very excited as I have been disappointed with numerous taco/Mexican restaurants in our area. Ordered multiple tacos to sample including the chicken, shrimp,beef and chorizo. And had to order the short rib tostada! Anything with a fried egg got to try it! The best thing about the whole meal was the chips and guacamole. Service was slow at half capacity . The tacos only offered in corn and were flimsy and fell apart. The chorizo had good flavor but was overwhelmed with the toppings. After eating the first taco everything else was cold, the Torida was double shelled and just ridiculous to try to eat every time you try to cut into it or stab at peace with your fork I just fell apart. So my quest continues to find good consistent Mexican food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Queso delicious - tacos delicious but can be spicy without warning. Managers and staff exceptionally attentive. Love the standing-table to hang out & get an appetizer if you're in for a wait."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. I think once you realize you can pay like 2 bucks a taco on the west coast, that 4 dollar tacos that are the size of a quarter aren't the best deal.   I got the Short Rib, Fish, Pollo Rojo and Pork Belly Pastor. I thought the taste was good but not spectacular by any means besides maybe the Short Rib.   For about $20 bucks with no sides or drinks, it's a bit pricey when you compare to other places in CLT that do tacos. It's practically empty for lunch but I could see this place doing well after work or during dinner so I can't comment too much on the atmosphere. The service was great tho."}
{"text":"So tasty! I had the watermelon margarita, queso & the veg tostada.  Everything was wonderful and VERY reasonably priced.   Check out the community table downstairs if they are busy & you have a small group - great option to eat earlier than originally able.  Just to note - the tostada is HUGE!"}
{"text":"Love this place for Mexican food downtown. Great variety, affordable, great drink selection, and awesome staff. Been there 3 times since they opened and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The tacos are so good, atmosphere is great, and the staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Heads up, Pittsburgh. There's a (relatively) new restaurant in town, and it's downright excellent! I've been here twice, and wish I could stop in more often. Honestly, this is THE place every other taco place needs to beat in my mind right now. That's how much my visits here have impressed me.  My first time here was actually pretty close top opening day - on a Saturday, no less. So the less than ideal time to visit a restaurant, I know. That's when foot traffic is heaviest and, let's be honest, mistakes are most likely to happen. But that visit with a group of friends was honestly fantastic! Aside from a single miscommunication at one point. I was told on the phone when I called the restaurant I could get in line with NoWait before arriving; no such luck - my info wasn't entered into NoWait until after I checked-in in person. A mild inconvenience, but after dining here, one I easily forgave.   Due to the dragging wait time for a table my group and I ended up eating at the bar to ensure we didn't miss our comedy show while waiting for people to clear out. Not that I blame people for wanting to linger as much as they did. This place is lovely - warm, welcoming, and the decor is interesting in that it kind of combines the rustic wooden eatery look with gorgeous modern murals of the city. Plus, the staff are amazing and were incredibly attentive during my first visit, constantly checking on the food and asking if we needed anything - and that was great service seeing as there was a never ending stream of drink and food orders coming in from the bar and dining area that night.  And oh my goodness. The food. I ordered the short rib and veggie tacos, and both were divine. Fresh. Crisp. Tender. Rich in flavor. Shall I go on? I shall not - because I have to save praise for the queso. The thick, creamy queso that makes every other queso eat its heart out. The queso that you can top high with beans, meat and jalapeno pepper. Add prompt rounds of strong and tasty drinks on top of all that flavor and sustenance, and I was a happy diner.   Since then I've been lucky enough to come back and share the Bakersfield experience with a family member. Once again, we left happy and full with good food and strong drinks. Although we did get a giggle from the fact that they were playing country music at the Mexican bar. Go figure. Really my only disappointment is that we weren't hungry enough to split that enormous plate of mouthwatering queso. Next time, Bakersfield. Next time!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been wanting to try it for a while, but everytime I look on Nowait, it said there was a long wait and you can't get in line until you go to the restaurant. So we waited for a Sunday night with no sporting events and the wait was less than 10 minutes.    Back to the food: it was super tasty and all the combinations were well done.  We got the chili, which appears to be disappearing off the menu soon.  It was a great pairing with the chips and queso, which were also out-of-this-world good.  The chili definitely had some kick to it.  Don't get it if you can't handle any heat.    We also had the short rib torta.  It was amazing.  It was the perfect mix of meat, arugula and bread.  It was good by itself, the tomatillo salsa that came with it was just ok and didn't add that much flavor.    We rounded it off with the conchinita pibil taco and the short rib taco.  Both were a perfect taste combination between the meat, toppings and tortilla and we would definitely get both again.    We did try a margarita!  I added it on last minute and didn't have a menu in front of me.  I asked for a \"fruity margarita\" (I know, not very classy) and they brought a great homemade blackberry margarita.  It was well made and the truly classy version of a \"fruity margarita\" and definitely not skimpy on the tequila.   The only quibble with a minor service issue that Jen, the manager, more than made up for.  In fact, she identified the problem before we brought it to her attention and went out of her way to make it a spectacular experience.  What started as problem turned in a great night out after a long day and we are hooked on this place and will be back.  It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Really rude staff ... The eye rolling and side commentary definitely over shadowed the food. The food is great and the menu has a nice variety. It'd be nice if the staff looked like they wanted to be there."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and it continues to impress me. First, the queso here is the pinnacle of what it should be. Molten, smooth, and extremely creamy with great spices. The chips that come along with it may be a bit too salty, but that is a minor flaw.   The. Tacos. Are. Beastly.   I really don't understand the culinary genius behind these things, but they have such a cacophony of blended flavors that just seem so perfectly matched. It really is just an epic meal to have. Overall, this place is my go to lunch spot in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Definitely has a good ambiance. We came mid afternoon and were promptly seated. I had the regular margarita. Flavorful with a hint of sweet. Our waitress India didn't really take the time to discuss the beers on draft. The only suggestion she gave was PBR. She also never took the time to explain popular menu items. We noticed the waitress at the table adjacent to us really took the time to explain different menu pairings.   The chips and guacamole were amazing. The chips were perfectly salted and the guacamole was made fresh. We asked for a side of salsa which I liked. It was more of a salsa verde; I definitely was expecting something different. If you want the more traditional salsa, ask for it. Otherwise they will bring the \"green salsa.\"  As an entree I ordered the short rib, steak, and chicken tacos. I seemed to need to doctor them up with the table salsas quite a bit. I'm not sure if this was the restaurant's intention. They did taste fresh with cilantro additions. The restaurant also used corn tortillas, which,  in general taste a bit drier to me.   Overall, not a bad experience, but I was expecting a little bit more. If I lived here, I probably would only come for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Great service and staff...... I would recommend this to anyone who wants good Mexican food. I live by the one in Cincinnati which is awesome. However this one make me want to move to Pittsburgh and I'm a Bengals fan. #whodey"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, the shrimp taco is my favorite! Definitely check out the queso, it's baked and delicious."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere in a happening part of downtown Pittsburgh. Chips and dip was good. The tacos were very tasty but are definitely on the smaller side."}
{"text":"The Milanesa Torta was DELISH. I have been here twice before and loved the tacos, but I have definitely found my new favorite dish. I will be back again (very soon!)"}
{"text":"The weekly Yelp jogged my memory on a legit taco shop I frequented recently, this of course being Bakersfield. Fantastic stuff here. I've heard only good things about this place so I made a special trip out here to scope it out.   We dropped in on a Saturday night with a packed house. After giving our names to the hostess, we proceeded to the bar for some real decent cocktails. I had the \"Bakersfield Sour\", which appealed to me by means of the Buffalo Trace bourbon. Could've been a fluke thing that night, but it was indeed a stiff drink- and I like!  After being seated, I guess I was a little thrown by the limited menu. The street tacos are clearly the staple here. As such, that's what we all ordered. After assuming that was go-to, the variety of tacos is pretty vast and you will absolutely find something you like. I had the fish, mole, and hongos. They were all fantastic. Great flavors.  Prices were modest to a little higher than average. Very upscale decor, well decorated. Although crowded, service was still top notch."}
{"text":"Visited last week, have been debating whether or not to post this.   I was in with some friends and while we were there we could hear a male manager (Lance, I asked our server) just yelling at the staff in the back.  It sounded ridiculous in the dining room and was very off-putting.  Food was meh- service and drinks were pretty decent though."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to bring people when they're visiting from out of town. I really like their drink selection; their margaritas are top notch and their tacos are pretty good for modernized Mexican food (not if you are looking for Tex mex on the other hand, indicated by the name, obviously). Service in here is usually great via the wait staff, although the hosts could be a little nicer (I mean, you are the first face customers see, right?). It gets crazy crowded here though, and sometimes you have overly enthusiastic 9-5ers screaming across the bar at one another about how much they're excited to be near each other. Overall, come for the food and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"My buddies and I stopped here on a weekend trip  and the tacos were good but my favorite was the queso and chips! So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots to eat in Cleveland. Tacos are amazing, ingredients always interesting and fresh and its easy on the wallet. Top notch, haven t had a bad visit yet. Place rules!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar. Wonderful and quick service by the bartender and services. The bartenders were very chill and made it so that I was able to enjoy my meal in peace.  The food came out quickly. However, I thought that the Mexican flavors might have been more authentic. The food was fresh but had more of an American taste to me. I truly love authentic Mexican cuisine - so there's the distinction in my taste buds.  The ambience was quite nice and the seats are for your group or communal seats."}
{"text":"Great portions for the price. Marg pitchers are deadly. Service great but come early to avoid the wait. Get the tostada (***short rib)."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual birthday dinner with friends. We had a big group (9), and we got a reservation to avoid long lines. It gets very busy and loud, as we got seated downstairs near the bar area. We didn't mind too much since it was casual, but you definitely have to speak up. We got the selecciones de la casa ($15 per person for 6+ parties) which comes with queso/guac/chips, salad, and tacos. We got to try all the tacos and really liked the short rib and fish. Got a free birthday whiskey shot which was nice, thanks to the server! Overall good fare for spending a fun Friday night."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very loud and my husband and I couldn't talk over the table and couldn't hear each other; which could be understandable as it is a bar. The service we got was not great. We had already made decisions about drinks and dinner before our waiter came to say hello. We felt that the food was good but not great. My tacos were not the best I have ever had but my husband said his were good. Overall, it was a good but not great experience given all the hype."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing here! But it smells like an old bleached out sunken Titanic downstairs."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's birthday here. The staff was so amazing!  They went above and beyond! I was so impressed with the level of service!!  The food and margaritas were excellent as well!  Thank you to the team at Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Many people I know raved about Bakersfield, and I was excited to try it. Sadly, I was disappointed. When first walking in the door no one was smiling, welcoming or helpful. We requested a booth and the man with the sleeve tattoo was not very accommodating and acted a bit bothered. On the other-hand our server, Scott was amazing. He was very attentive and friendly. My meal was alright, but not as good as advertisesI'm not sure if I would return, but Scott was great. On our way out, no thank you from the host or any acknowledgement."}
{"text":"Best margs!! The great thing about Bakersfield is you don't get charged an arm and a leg per taco, so you can try them all. My favorites are the fish and pollo rojo. I love the atmosphere and the large tables with bench seating. Great for larger groups."}
{"text":"Sydney is the best waitress ever!! I had my bachelorette party at Bakersfield and they took SUCH good care of me!! GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. Luckily we had reservations for a larger party. We were crammed in a booth. I think a table would have been more practical but I guess this was the best they could have done. Oh well. Just glad we got to sit. My friends ordered a pitcher of Spicy margaritas. It looked good, had hot peppers in them with a wooden spoon to mix. I tried a virgin margarita, prego friendly which was nice! I didn't want to feel left out.  I think my favorite taco is the short rib. The waiter claimed that the fish tacos are the best but I beg to differ. It was alright wish it had a little more flavor. Now that I think of it, try the sauces. They had a smokey salsa and a tomatillo sauce. Darn my prego brain! Overall the tacos are pretty tasty, simple, but small. Prices are decent. I think they make their own tortillas from what the waiter said. The appetizers were really good. I tried the corn dip, queso, and the guacamole. Yummy! They also ran out of tequila. Haha what kind of bar runs out of tequila? But what do I care. I'm pregnant. ? I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love Bakersfield.  Taco...yes. Tequila...yes. Whiskey...yes. What's not to love?  I get the Hongos without the cheese and sub the kale slaw (it has buttermilk) for the cilantro slaw and the Huitlacoche without cheese, so yummy!  They have the best guac around, and I've had A LOT of guac :)  They can sling some drinks here too.  Amazing atmosphere, it's a great way to decompress after work."}
{"text":"Neither food nor service are impressive, hopefully the drinks will keep this place alive until Spring.   I dropped in Saturday as tacos sounded a great idea on the last of the warm fall days. When I sat at the bar & caught up with a friend for 5 to 10 minutes, it took the bartender asking to refill my friends' drinks for her to come over and even then I had to get her attention myself to get a menu or water.  Perusing the menu was as disappointing. No entrees, chips & salsa are $3. Within 3 blocks is Moe's & Tijuana Flats. I get that Bakersfield's chips & salsa are made daily but do you really decide where to eat based exclusively on this side item? Tacos are $4 each and they're small. They are tasty, but flour tortillas aren't available, tacos are served on white corn tortillas only.   My friends had the short rib sandwich earlier and remarked it was good but a lot of bread. I ordered 3 tacos, one pastor and each style of chicken. They came out in a timely fashion and the pastor is a good example balanced with fresh pineapple. I couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken styles. Still peckish, I had the veggie tortilla of fried potatoes, black beans, guac and lettuce. It's quite a treat!  I like the decor, the roll up doors and naked lights are a relaxed vibe. While I again waited for the bartender's attention to get my check, I noticed the bar back squeezing lemons for their margaritas. Since my friends stayed and had a pitcher they must be pretty good. It seems like a great place to drink which isn't my thing.   Given the lack of parking, other places with equally good pastor tacos at better prices (la unica on central) and no reservations you could very well hunt for parking, find it, and have an hour wait. **The manager sent a yelp compliment and clarified they have more valet spots than those at Berrybrook up to 40 spots total** Still I hope the owners have the cash to survive until spring when margaritas or beers with a gentle breeze blowing in off East Blvd is a great idea."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that we love this place! We drive from Davidson twice a week just to eat here!! Food is always consistent and amazing!! Went today and had terrible customer service from waitress named Danielle. Tossed plates on the table, never brought refills, added 2 extra tacos to our tab that we didn't get or ask for but by the time she brought the check we just wanted to get out of there so I paid the extra 8 dollars to leave. Please tell me this isn't the new norm here bc I love this place!!  ****update since review, just hours ago! The owner has already contacted me to make it right! I knew this place had a great soul along with its amazing food! Thank you Brian!! I'll be back this week!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting little spot with good margaritas. Hipster Heaven.  Cool interior and a a cool crowd. They do margaritas by the pitcher or individually in mason jars - I give them a B+  We walked down to try it because a friend had been to the one in Cincinnati and really liked it. My first impression was that it was way too crowded for the amount of space inside and extremely loud. It has picnic tables, barrel tables and some cute booths. I liked the garage style doors that open to the street - that was my favorite feature.  The specialty drinks were few - i usually have to try specialty cocktails wherever I go, but both of the choices on the menu were heavy duty liquor.. so i skipped that. I can't handle bourbon or whiskey... :-/  We had to wait about an hour at one of their standing bars and we had some chips and guac. The guac was pretty fresh - I give that an A - the one item I give an A+ is the cheese with Chorizo - that was awesome!  They serve tacos À la carte and that seems to be what their \"thing\" is - the tacos are mock street-style (I say mock because they don't taste anything like street tacos, but then again, i am from Los Angeles... so take that with a sprig of cilantro) They weren't bad - they just weren't really authentic in any way. I had a few different kinds... just to be sure :)   I wasn't really happy with the wait considering how long it took them to re-seat empty tables and to wait on tables that were already seated - and they have a large empty area near the front door/bar that could accommodate about 3 or 4, 2 tops.. that could have alleviated some of the back up of people mashed together in the walk areas.  The server we finally got when we were seated was extremely MEH - we joked with her and she acted like we were annoying her by being silly or humorous. Maybe she was just tired... but hey - so were we after standing for an hour - waiting for a table.  I might be back.. not sure..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late-night snack after the Pittsburgh Jazz Festival. We  ended up arriving during happy hour, which was great! The $2 tacos are good, but I don't know that I'd buy them full-price. They're a bit on the small side for what you'd originally pay and, while they're good, they're not anything majorly more impressive compared to the other tacos in the area. That said, their guacamole was wonderful and enough to get me to return again. In addition, they have a solid draft list and a diverse cocktail menu.  Definitely a good option if you're already in the area and want something quick and casual."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been coming here for well over a year and only last night did we receive the FULL REAL DEAL SERVICE from London ! Our service prior has always been hit or miss and the main reason we return is for the killer pitcher of Sangria and to catch bits and pieces of a western flick - HOWEVER - London CRUSHED IT last night ! Friendly, fast service with a POSITIVE ATTITUDE! We will return and specifically ask for her. If you know whats good for you, you will too! Keep it up London !"}
{"text":"Good Americanized Mexican food.  Much better decor than Barrio stereotypical Day of the Dead motif."}
{"text":"tacos were delish and bartender extrordinairre Lissa made the best cocktails!"}
{"text":"So, I've given this review a lot of thought. My consensus is that I enjoyed my evening at Bakersfield. The food, atmosphere, service, and decor were up to par. Although they hang their hat on the idea that they are an affordable restaurant, if you think about it logically it really isn't any more of a value than any other restaurant in the area for dinner (unless you literally only want a bite). At $4 a taco it's $17 for only TWO tacos and ONE drink...let's say you get three if you're really hungry, maybe four if you're a dude, along with one or two $9 drinks...shit is gettin' real on your tab. It's simply not an affordable meal to me. Sorry, it's really not!   The cocktails (jalapeno margaritas) were really good, albeit expensive ($9). I could tell they used fresh citrus and one was enough to \"do the trick\" on little ol' me. The white corn tortillas are house made and I appreciate all the interesting and unique ingredients, the fish was my favorite. The queso was divine.   If you're looking for a fun new place to try for a get together or date night, check out Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I am a new transplant to the area, and everywhere I go I search for the best tacos in town. This would have to be my favorite place yet! We went on a Friday night and the place was really busy. My boyfriend and I had awesome drinks and queso at the bar before being seated. The tacos were great, however the service was very average. There were multiple beers on the import menu that our server told us they never even carries, which was a little frustrating, however, the food was so good as well as the sangria!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Bakersfield if you love tacos, margaritas, guacamole and/or great service! I've frequented this place since they've opened and had consistently good food and service. This evening, Shannon was our server and made wonderful recommendations, was knowledgeable and offered wonderful customer service! Get the pineapple margaritas--not too sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"What a fun new place to hang out downtown! It gets pretty packed on weekends, but even with the big crowds service is excellent. A special shout out to Beans, who is the coolest, sweetest server ever with absolutely rocking hair. My friends and I would go back just to hang out with her!  The guac and chips are awesome. You also get green & red sauces with them and both are fantastic. To drink I love their Paloma, but they also have a pretty impressive collection of drinks from Mexico & Latin America that you don't see at other places. Great scene, great Beans :-)"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went here for an impromptu girls night and I honestly so worth the 40 min wait! Staff was friendly and attentive, food was amazing! We both had two tacos and split the queso and it was filling, fresh and delicious.. Margs were delicious and strong!"}
{"text":"The Milanese torta is the most amazing torta known to man. I'm obsessed. I always go at lunch time but I may need to come for dinner and try one of those margaritas that everyone is raving about."}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch here and I agree that the food here is really good. As is the atmosphere and decor.  I am not a \"day drinker\" so I will definitely be coming back to taste a margarita or two some evening in the not to distant future.  As far as our meal, we had the plain queso that I thought was really rich. I was wondering why they didn't serve salsa with their chips when i saw it right there in front of me in two squeeze bottles, one red, one green.  The green was probably the best sauce I've had on a tortilla. I also had two tacos, the fish and pork belly.  I do NOT like cilantro so thankfully I was able to get the pork belly without it but it was part of the slaw on the fish, so it was simply not to my taste.  But i ate just the fish and that by itself was pretty darn good. In short, i would definitely return."}
{"text":"Here we go...  I'm enamored with the setting of this spot. Has a certain hip feel to it with proper lighting for the interior and the atmosphere around the area is lovely. Our attendant was quite accomodating and did her best to make our experience grand. The queso dip was awesome and I highly suggest you try it. Chips are nice and warm. Tacos were BOMB and this is coming from an LA dude. I did love how our attendant wanted to verify which tequila my friend wanted and how best to make a Cadillac Margarita so there wouldn't be disappointment instead of assuming. I do wish there were a few more cider/wine options, but it's fine. I'm fine.  This is a good spot for a date or group outing. Come try it out.  Got it? Good."}
{"text":"Great place! Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. I had the ShortRib Taco and a side of black beans, both were delicious! Smaller tacos, make sure you get a few."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and I can't say enough about the manager Patrick! The food, atmosphere, and service was all around outstanding. Came in before a concert and was in and out right on time and had a wonderful time. Will definitely recommend and come back"}
{"text":"nice, good margaritas, small portions  i feel like i have to order a lot of food to feel full. its good though"}
{"text":"We love the Bakersfield in Columbus and were excited to find out there would soon be one in Cleveland!  The new restaurant is located on West 25th Street, just down from the West Side Market.  Parking is tricky.  There are a few valet lots around but, for those of us who are way too cheap to valet park, you probably can find a spot in the parking lot near St. Ignatius which is just a short walk away.  The place was very busy on an early Saturday night.  They took our phone number and we waited at a tall table near the front.  The restaurant is pretty small and they look like they will have a few outdoor tables when the weather gets better.  A waiter asked if we wanted to have something to drink while we waited and my husband ordered a margarita and I had a sangria.  Both were very good!  My husband, a big fan of tequila, also tried a shot of tequila which was on special for only $3!  After a few minutes waiting, we headed to a table and ordered food.  We split an order of guacamole and chips and a salad.  Then we ordered two tacos each which were all very tasty!  The tacos are small but, since we also had chips and a salad, they were plenty for us.  We will certainly be back, hopefully to try the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"The best food and libations in downtown Cleveland. Our server, Lauren, was wonderful and our service was excellent. Their house margarita is made with fresh sweet and sour, no cheap pre-mix.  We sampled almost all the taco choices and guacamole. They were authentic, high quality selections. The decor and ambience is great."}
{"text":"Just moved to Cleveland and this is the first restaurant I've found that I'd go back to! Great tacos, great service, strong tasty margs.   I tried the Chorizo and chicken tacos and both were great! They're a bit small so you may want to order 2 or 3 for a meal. The Bakersfield Margarita is great! A pitcher is about 8 glasses and totally worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is so good and service is top-notch. Normally stop in for drinks but I recently stopped in to have dinner plus drinks.. Our server Matt was amazing. he was also there when we needed him but he allowed us to enjoy dinner without a lot of interruptions. He always kept our waters topped off and our alcoholic beverages plenty. The queso is some of the best I have ever had. The fish tacos are super fresh. The atmosphere is very lively."}
{"text":"This time our visit was great and I appreciate a lot the excellent customer service that Brian the owner has. The queso with chorizo is a must !"}
{"text":"Rounding up 3.5 stars. Stopped by for a late dinner around 10pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full but luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.   The location of this restaurant is great and the space itself is really cool, with the big open windows in the front.   I wasn't drinking so I can't comment on the margaritas, though they looked really good. They only had two beers on draft which seemed like a pretty limited selection. They had a lot of bottle options but as a person who definitely would choose a draft, I was sort of bummed.   We started with the chips and guac. A large portion and the guac had just the right amount of spiciness and a great flavor. It was very fresh, I just wish it was mashed up a little better. There were huge chunks of avocado that we ended up cutting up ourselves or mushing with a chip before eating.   We got a selection of tacos and the chicken chorizo torta (I think...the crispy one). Tacos were on the small side but very tasty..my favorites were the pastor and the short rib.   At $40 for two people without alcohol, the price is a bit steep, but the food is a bit more specialty and the location is prime so I was expecting about this price range.   Service was fine but unremarkable. One other thing to note..it is LOUD. The acoustics in the long narrow space mean everything is really amplified. three guys next to us were VERY obnoxiously singing the same one line from one song for about 45 minutes. They were clearly really drunk. It was annoying but this was 10pm on a Saturday at a bar/restaurant so I didn't feel justified being too mad about it. I would return."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!! Scott was an excellent server. Had the Bisteak tacos which were soooo delicious; if I had more room in my stomach I'd still be eating them! My daughter said the fish tacos were the best she's ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with great food and great drink specials. First time I was here was for a lunch....liked it so much I went back for dinner that same day. I've had most of their tacos and they are all very good and taste like a lot of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The great taco debate ends here. Ive heard so many mixed reviews of this place so i absolutely had to try it to compare to the other big name taco spots in Cleveland and I was left sad with a soggy taco.  First, the parking lot is a MESS, its off west 25th and you have to pay to park? nah you good, i parked at the west side market (illegally but shhh we dont like snitches) and walked over. SO problem solved there. Secondly, its a little crammed in there for me, the staff was very friendly though.  To the food. The usual taco options, but for  me they werent wowing. I had one with brisket and an egg on it? like i love brisket and eggs but not together, I get it its something new but the consistency in my mouth was not happy. The queso came out kind of dry, how the heck can queso be dry? well they burnt the hell out of it is how. Big NO NO. They have a limited selection of food, and for me thats whomp city because other taco spots let you fully customize your taco experience.  Alas, price was too much for me It compare to other taco places but for what i got here and what I can get at places like Barrio ill stay with what I know. Sorry bakersfield but its going to be a no from me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service (quick and knowledgeable), super tasty, fresh Mexican food! It is a small menu, but everything on it is delicious! Tons of beers on tap! Parking isn't the greatest, but they do have valet across the street!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and staff was superb. Premium margarita is a must try. Guac sampler, fish Mahi taco, and cochinita pibil taco were also very good. Great ambience and music."}
{"text":"The best street tacos I've ever had. The fish tacos are my absolute favorite. Classic margaritas are delicious. The food prices are reasonable but the alcohol is pricey. Try buying a pitcher and sharing to save money. If i was just rating the food, the place would get a  star but sadly the service is always terrible. The hosts are always really nice and friendly but the servers are always absent and hard to find. I have been to Bakersfield around 25 times in the past 3 years and have had one good server in that time frame. The rest are friendly but never around."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try Bakersfield for lunch and enjoyed it.  I really liked the decor which was welcoming and relaxing.  I tried the Papa Tostada and would get it again.    Four stars only because we ordered chips and salsa, which went to waste.  I think the server could have given us a heads up to try the queso or guacamole as the salsa that came with the chips was the same salsa provided as a condiment.   However, now I look forward to going back and trying chips & queso and margaritas."}
{"text":"First timer, tonight! Great food selection, great service, great drinks, great atmosphere! We came for a fun family night out and really enjoyed our selection. Our waiter, JB, was very polite, funny (keeping up with my dad, the jokester,) and accommodating. We got the Bakersfield margarita and it was DELICIOUS! Our guacamole and queso was fresh and the chips were fresh to match. I got two mole tacos and they were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't say enough good things about Bakersfield. We went on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately, but the place was not empty. I think we managed to beat the crowd by going closer to 6 pm than to 7. The decor is very hipster and modern. It gives off great vibes and creates a wonderful environment.  You can pick however many of each taco you want, and you can keep ordering if you want more. I recommend trying two or three to start and then going from there. The tacos come out all on one platter for the whole table, so remember which ones you ordered and what the server says they are when they get to you!   I ordered two of the pork belly pastor tacos and one of the conchinita pibil tacos, which are both pork. The conchinita pibil taco did not impress me too much, but the pork belly pastor may have been the very best taco I have ever eaten. A marinated pork with pineapple, onion, and cilantro? Oh yes. And each taco comes with a lime slice next to it, so feel free to add a little extra flavor to your taco!   The service was absolutely wonderful, as well. Our server was more than willing to answer all our questions and give recommendations. The food also came out incredibly quickly - we were in an out in no time.  The only downside is the parking. Because they have a corner location, they really don't have their own parking lot. They have a free valet and the market across the street, but we didn't see that until after we had parked at the Jersey Mike's across the street. I don't know how they feel about that, but our car was still there and ticket-less when we came out, so no harm no foul?"}
{"text":"I went here for drinks in the downstairs bar area. The house special margarita was very tasty and the service was top notch. I will return!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chips and guacamole (which we highly recommend has a nice lime taste but not too strong!), also order 3 tacos each Mine were the fish taco which was good but not great the fish didn't have a strong flavor, the short rib taco which was good but nothing special expected more sauce and taste and last the al pastor taco which was good but had a very pineapple taste. My husband ordered the short rib which was okay, the pollo rojo which was well seasoned and tasty, then lastly his favorite cochinita pibil that had a slightly spicy kick to it. Overall good experience, the atmosphere and staff is live and friendly and our server Alexis was very friends and a great host to us! Wouldn't be a regular but wouldn't stay away from eating here"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service and the food. On a busy Friday night, a group of five of us got in with a wait that was a good bit less than they told us. Add to that our waiter Jason was awesome! He was funny, friendly, and attentive.   We all shared the salsa, queso, and guac and all were excellent! The salsa verde is very bright and flavorful!The tacos are ala carte and we were told people tend to eat 2-3. After apps, 2 was plenty. My favorite was the fish taco, but the pollo rojo and short rib tacos were also good. The only slightly negative thing is that the corn tortillas used are thicker than avg. Granted, they held up to very full and saucy fillings, but I think I prefer when 2 thinner tortillas are stacked.  There was just something off about the thick tortilla.     We had a variety of margaritas and they were all very good! Not skimpy by any means. Great first experience here!"}
{"text":"amazing tacos. always has tequilas for shots of the days. what a great deal! the tortas are legit too. the elote dip was interesting. a bit too cheesy than a traditional elote, but definitely a good place to visit for brunch or happy hour"}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I have friends visiting from out of town I bring them here. It's a nice casual place that I enjoy every time I come. The tacos and tostadas are delicious. I've tried most of them (including the vegetarian ones) and they're all good! Try the seasonal margarita and the spicy margarita! The wait can be a bit long during popular times so make sure you get in line on the No Wait app!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for appetizers during happy hour but they didn't have any happy hour specials.   The guacamole was delicious but spicy. It comes with radish as a garnish. It is a little small for the price we paid but it was good!   We also ordered the Queso with chorizo. The top was toasted and had a nice layer of cheese!   Don't forget about the drink! We ordered a classic margarita and it was refreshing! I would definitely order it again!   Overall the atmosphere is fun and relaxing!"}
{"text":"I came here on National Margarita Day which just so happens to be my birthday as well. Coincidence? I think not. Surprisingly they did not have any margarita specials although they had a chalkboard sign outside that said come here for National Margarita day. My friends and I ordered a variety of margaritas and some queso. Their queso is so cheesy and delicious and I love that it comes in a small cast iron skillet with warm and fresh chips. The drinks are good and the queso is excellent, I get the queso every time I'm in here. Next time you should try it to if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch shot. Great tacos, but I especially loved the spare rib torta and the margarita with jalapeno. Atmosphere is fun and quirky - the tv was playing the John Wayne True Grit. Loved the vibe. Austin-esque."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I've been here twice now and enjoyed my food both times. It's not pricey at all for food downtown.  The guacamole was really good and so were the fish tacos. I will be coming back for sure. The only thing I would change is the group tables."}
{"text":"The tacos are yummy, the atmosphere is cool, and the service was tight...but that isn't why we will be back. The queso. Oh my word - the queso. The queso is literally the stuff dreams are made of...absolutely life-changing."}
{"text":"So good. I think I sampled a little of everything here including the tacos and all the food was amazing. I ordered a margarita to drink, which was excellent as well.   They have an outdoor seating area, which would have been nice if it were not raining!  The only thing I didn't like about Bakersfield is that the music is really loud, so it was difficult to have a conversation.  In summary: great food and drinks, but loud music in the background!"}
{"text":"Rating 3.5! Wish we could do .5 on here. Atmosphere, service, cocktails and beer selection all great. The tacos itself are a bit dry. I have no been there three times and other than the shrimp, the meats appear to be a little dry. I also ordered queso on my last visit that was great, but it was brought out cold the first time. Overall I would definitely go again and explore the menu"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is nothing short of fabulous. The people are passionate and the atmosphere is electric. The food is knock your socks off good. It's very simple and that's my style. I cannot stay out of the guacamole. My favorite tacos are the short rib. My typical order is one in which I share...random tacos and guacamole/chips for the group. Cherry on top?  The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great atmosphere! Our waiter was great and really informative, I believe his name was Luke. A very chill and relaxed environment. The food tasted so flavorful and fresh. Had the queso with everything on it(black beans, chorizo, jalapeños) it was great. Got a couple tacos which had me craving more and a margarita that was delish! Would definitely come back. Also they get extra points for having a crazy amount of charging stations beside the purse hooks at the bar! Great date night but we could also imagine having a night out with friends here."}
{"text":"Great drinks.  Communal tables. Yummy chunky guacamole.  I had a fish taco and shrimp taco.  Very small but filling. Service was attentive and food came out quick.  Definitely recommend for quick meal if you are at convention center."}
{"text":"Great tacos! A little to expensive for 1 taco but I guess you pay for the atmosphere all together. The salsas you get on the side are quite tasty. We ordered and got our food rather fast. We really didn't venture further than the usual tacos. But good experience will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Shout out to my home Meleah who may read this review (she read ALL my reviews people). lol  TACOS!!!!!! I. LOVE. TACOS! I can have them for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. That's how much I love mexican food.   Now being in the pregnant state that I am, I have two cravings, watermelon and TACOS. And on my usual monthly night out with these homies (it was my turn to choose) I had to choose this place based on the reviews and pics.   The appetizer queso joint was good. My homie Meleah asked me what I want in it (perks of pregnancy) and I wanted all the shi*t in it. And guess what... I loved it! Chorizo is a bit salty so make sure you stir that up some.   I got 5 different tacos... don't ask me which ones. (pregnancy brain)  I just remembered that I I really didn't like the fish taco. It needed some sort of cream on it and it just seemed bland and dry.   Another taco (can't remember the meat) had too much slaw in it, so that was pretty dry as well.   Imma go back...   The service was good. How good?: I'm driving around in circles trying to find a spot to park and my homie told me where she parked so I parked behind her on Kenilworth. (don't park in the garage). Then I'm walking and walking, practically circling the building cuz I'm like \"where the sh*t is this place\". I guess the dude my friend was speaking to figured I'd be searching for the place, so he came outside to show me the restaurant is that end of the sidewalk, right across from Berrybrook Farms. That was kind, because it was hot as sh*t outside and me and my pregnant a** was about to skip out if I couldn't find the joint.   Check it out tho... Cheers!"}
{"text":"Comfortable hangout with a great bar and uber-fresh tacos.  Of the three tacos I sampled (Conchinta Pibil, Pollo Rojo, and Fish), the fish won the round.  It was lightly breaded mahi piping hot with super cool and crunchy citrus slaw.  Loved it!  The Conchinita was smokin' with great heat right over the plate.  Thankfully, Budweiser was there to offer relief.   Carla, my server, was friendly and explained the menu.  Once I figure out parking, I'm coming back and with friends in tow.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious and the margaritas are a must. They have a great atmosphere and good crowd whatever night you go. I've been luck to find a spot at the at the bar every time I've gone, but if you're not that lucky, just grab a drink and wait until they give you a call to go to your table. Once you order your food the wait isn't long at all. There's valet parking across the street so you don't have to worry about parking which I heard was a big deal at the previous restaurants at this location."}
{"text":"Totally rockin place to come for tacos and a pitcher of margaritas to share with friends! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went to Bakersfield last night for the 1st time. Had a great tome and will be coming back. Loved the vibe of the country blues theme. Can't go wrong with tequila or whiskey! I had the sangria. It was fantastic. Service was really good no issues at all. Courteous. Knowledgeable. And timely. The food was awesome. Get the queso!!!!! Got the chicken torta and was not disappointed. Overall cool place and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Since my first two bad experiences here, I have gone back several times. I initially gave this place 2 stars, but it was when they first opened and they have done a great job of working some of the kinks out. The margaritas are some of the best I've ever had and the guacamole as well as the queso are awesome. The tacos are pretty solid, nothing to \"wow\" over though. It's a great watering hole to check out with friends! Be wary of the constant crowd. Seats at the bar are usually available during the week, no problem, but you'll be hard pressed to get a table during peak hours on any night."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Appeases my fiancè's need for margaritas and my need for above average food. Atmosphere is fun and laid back. We got a pitcher of margaritas and 6 tacos. Short rib was amazing. Staff was friendly and attentive. Went here back in November and planning a return trip this Saturday. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Saturday night crowd. Drinks are not overpriced. My tacos came out extremely fast even though the place was crowded. The red wine sangria was tasty. My first Moscow mule was perfect. However, the second was extremely sour. And for some reason I was charged for 3 even though I only had two. I didn't even want to bother trying to explain that to the bartender in a loud crowded bar so I just ate the cost."}
{"text":"I'm in town for the weekend visiting friends from college. LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant! It was so chic and modern. The service here was wonderful! Our waitress was great, and the service from the bartender, and other waitstaff here was excellent.  The queso appetizer was absolutely delicious and I'd say the highlight of the meal! It was gone within a few minutes.  I ordered the papas tostadas & the short rib taco. I really enjoyed the short rib taco, the papas was alright. All of my friends really enjoyed their meals.   Another highlight was the salsa sauces. Dangg were those delicious!! The green one... LAWD! I could not stop eating it and am embarrassed to say I used 3/4ths of the bottle. That itself was worth it! Soooo delicious, and fresh.  This would be a cute place for a date!"}
{"text":"The vibe of Bakersfield is pretty laidback--it's a great place to get together with friends and chat over a drink and some tacos.  I've been here a few times and the servers are always friendly and the food is always fantastic.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs portion.  I've never actually been seated upstairs, but downstairs is relaxed and has its own full bar.  As a note, they do have gluten free options.  I overheard a conversation with a waitress and another patron."}
{"text":"How many taco places does this town need?  There are so many in town I think we passed 2 other ones on the way to this place.  Although, you'd never know from the name, that it was a taco joint.  The waitress also told us that it's a chain (there are other locations in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Charlotte, and Nashville).   I am glad we came because I've wanted to check it out for a while now.  This was my first time here and I have to say I love the vibe of this place.  There were tons of people here for taco Tuesday but it's so big I never felt crowded.  We were seated downstairs and I liked it just as much as upstairs.   Mood lighting was perfect.  Our waitress, Lindsay, was super and gave great recommendations.  Love the chips and guac and I also loved my short rib tostada - it had a fried egg on it!  Our table ordered a variety of tacos but I only tasted the cochinita pibil (braised pork and pickled red onion) which  was incredibly spicy but pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the tostada a bit more to be honest.  Our pitcher of margaritas went down quickly - a little sweet but I liked it enough to finish the pitcher.  Would definitely return - it was a good time and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was not impressed! The tacos had no flavor and there was too much filling in the taco to have only one tortilla shell. The margarita's had no liquor, they literally tasted like pure pineapple juice. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone wanting to grab a delicious taco"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Great atmostphere, friendly staff. The food was fantastic and the sauces on the table are delicious. Lots of options on the menu and overablle great experience."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would!  I normally take pictures of places I'm really excited to eat at, but unfortunately the tacos looked so good I ate them before my phone made it out of my pocket.  This place is epic!!! Truly unbelievable food. To make it better, it's cheap, cheaper than McDonalds. Each taco is like $4 and the sandwich is like 8. We ordered every taco on the menu and a torta plus drinks and the queso appetizer and our bill was $65.   Service was top notch from hostess to servers to the taco man! I could not be more happy with my experience here."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and decor here! However, the tacos were disappointing. The taco shells were soggy :( The margarita pitcher and chips were good but how could you mess those up"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant in Cincinnati and Columbus so was familiar with it, but didn't love it when I went there, but going again to the one in Ohio City, I'm in love!! I went with a friend this past week, aka the week it opened, and you would have had no idea they were a brand new restaurant.  They definitely worked out all the kinks before opening.   I love the ambiance. It's new, fun, has garage doors and a cute patio.  Love the picnic table idea, but if you don't they also have individual tables for groups.    I went with a friend and we are big Mexican connoisseurs.  We split a pitcher of their regular margaritas and they were delicious, definitely strong, but I enjoyed them and very reasonably priced I thought.  I think in the pitcher we each got 3 glasses, so ended up being a little over $5 a glass.    As an appetizer we ordered the queso and added pickled jalapenos to it.  It was very good! It's served in a cast iron dish with a queso consistency on the bottom then broiled cheese on the top, there was not a single bite left when we were done.  They give you 2 kind of salsas for the table and a hot sauce.  Their hot sauce is very good, not too hot but really good flavor.  I didn't love the salsa, the smokey one is just too smokey for me, almost doesn't taste like salsa as much as  bbq kind of sauce.  They also have a green one, which is pretty good, but kind of bland.    I've had their tacos and they are good, but I don't love corn tortillas (I prefer flour) so I thought I would try something different.  I got the short rib torta and let me tell you, I do not think I will ever order anything else! The dressing on the lettuce was not overwhelming, the meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly and I ate the entire dish.  My friend got the short rib sandwich kind of one. I cant remember the exact name, but she said hers was top notch as well!   All in all, it's a perfect day drinking spot, dinner spot, date night, etc.  I will be back.  They also have a $3 shot of the day.. can you say hell yeah?"}
{"text":"Great guacamole (I'd give it 5 stars), just enough spice to balance it out. I really enjoy the tacos being a la carte, it's easier to mix and match. They have great bartenders that can hammer out the margaitas. It's definitely a place that you go with your group and not a place that you look to find a group that'll hang out."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite joint in the Burgh!  I went for lunch and sat at the bar.  Kaitlyn was our server/bar tender and she was so bubbly and very informative about the menu/cocktails. She had a constant smile and was giving us the right dose of service!  I do not like cilantro and it unfortunately comes on most of the tacos.  The good thing is that most of them just have it on top as a garnish, except for a few.  Of course the mahi mahi fish taco had it in the slaw that came with it.  I ordered it sans slaw and got the lime sauce only.  They were very accommodating and brought the slaw out separately, in case I could stomach i!  I also got the braised short rib taco.  This was a very rare choice for me since I am mainly a pescatarian, but wow! It was the best recipe I had ever had.  The meat was cooked for several hours, was soft and just melted in your mouth.  It had a sort of cinnamon taste to it so I asked Kaitlyn what was in the \"sauce\" She coyly smiled and told me it is a secret recipe but I was on to something by tasting cinnamon.  I also tried a regular margarita.  She asked me exactly how I liked it and it came out exactly how I had asked.  My friend decided to try a Manhattan and she had also asked how he would like it and BAM, exactly how he asked.  In addition to the tacos we had the queso.  I am not typically a fan of queso, chips and salsa, etc. but I liked that you could add ingredients, such as black beans, chorizo, etc.  We added the black beans.  This delectable app. came out on a small iron skillet dish, with warm and house-made chips.  The chips were a nice consistency (not too thick, but didn't break easy) and the queso was by far the best I ever had.  It is real cheese, a gooey, warm skillet of comfort for sure!  Kaitlyn also suggested that we take a peek downstairs at the space they had.  It isn't always open during lunch but it was on this particular day because of many events in the city.  It is a perfect spot for a celebratory dinner or birthday gathering with a group of friends.  The bar upstairs and downstairs is very spacious and the decor is rustic and similar to a lot of the gastro pubs but it also had it's own flair.  I highly recommend this place.  The only downside of course is parking since it is downtown.  If you have a show or you are looking for a great atmosphere to meet friends, this is your place!  Welcome to the Burgh Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"This place makes me sad to eat anything else -- paid 8$ for two tacos that were surprisingly filling and ridiculously tasty."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I reactivated my Yelp account solely to write this review. I went here for the first time about a week ago for a birthday dinner and fell in love with everything; the atmosphere, the food, and especially our server Jason. He heard it was my birthday so gave me a complimentary shot of the best tequila I'd ever tasted. My friends and I got the guac and queso to start as well as a couple drinks. The queso is different, not what you would expect, but super flavorful and I had a hard time putting it down. We also got one of every taco on the menu and I would have to say the fish and the pollo ones were the best. This place was so delish, that I even went there a few days later! The only downside is the wait..I would definitely recommend downloading the \"no wait\" app before going out, unles youre ok with waiting over an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"This place has made being downtown for happy hour a dream (they don't have happy hour specials per se, but me being happy eating tacos and drinking is good enough for me). If you can head over right at 5, you can most likely grab a spot at the bar downstairs. I am a margarita lover, and these are the best I've had in Pittsburgh. I've tried most all of their tacos, but I'm a creature of habit and usually default to one fish (typically I get two for dinner). The guac and the queso are both awesome, and typically come out with warm chips. The crowd here for happy hour is pretty standard, I've even gone midday on the weekends, but I will say that when I tried to come on a Friday night I was relatively turned off by the packed house and clientele. That's life on a Friday night - and in no way changes the fact that this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Hands down the best margarita I've ever had in the 216. Great location, great food, endless list of bourbon to choose from. Ask for Nickole, all of her recommendations were spot on!"}
{"text":"My previous Yelp review on this restaurant was taken down and not sure why. I came here about 2 months ago and ordered the tacos and chips and queso dip. Following my meal I was sick for about a week with food poisoning. I don't think I will be making a trip back."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Probably the best tacos I've had in town. Babalu has good tacos too. But the queso was so different! Definitely a cool place to go with friends. The staff were so kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a nice Mexican restaurant. The salsas were very good. The guacamole could have been a little less chunky but had s great little kick to it. The queso was delicious.  The tacos were good street tacos and you can't really go wrong with any of them. I recommended looking at the specials because you can find some delicious tacos not on the main menu. The atmosphere is casual and had Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid playing on the tv. The beer and margarita selection is vast and has something for everyone. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait a bit for a table. The staff was friendly and our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Staff was amazing. Everyone was helpful and attentive! Would definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Bakersfield, your staff is on point from the hostess to the bar to the kitchen. Really well done. Your staff is having fun and it creates a great atmosphere, keep it up! I had a spicy margarita (okay, I had two bc it was great), guacamole, and a salad with crispy chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"What a scrumptious, family-style dinner, with perfectly seasoned tacos (El Pastor's my fave)! Low-key but still classy ambience with a wide selection of adult beverages. I must admit that I still don't understand the use of black-and-white silent movies in the background... seems a bit incongruous... perhaps intended to add a chic quality? Only minor concern was the slight delay in ordering after we received our drinks (~15min), but the tacos were well worth the wait!  Have been there 3 times and intend to return for more tacos (which I'm already craving)!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and loved it every time! Awesome margs, decent tacos, and outstanding guac! Check out the basement - love the ambiance! Great spot for happy hours if you work downtown!"}
{"text":"I was very hopeful walking in.....well once I could get there. Parking was awful. The inside is very cool and I had high hopes. The menu confused me. The server confused me and the tacos were small and served with only one corn tortilla which broke apart. I got two tace at 3.50 a pice and was not full. Didnt love it and wont be back. :("}
{"text":"In a competitive landscape of taco hangouts, Bakersfield stands tall on a high peak looking down on the rest. What is it that makes them so great??   Good food: yes Great drinks: check Convenient location: yup Phenomenal service: OH HECK YEAH!!  I can't speak for the rest of the waitstaff because I only ask for Steve Murphy (seems like they do a good job too), but Stevie goes above and beyond. He even went so far as to pat off my lap when he accidentally spilled a Jalepeño Marg on me lol! Even with the bartenders he lends a helping hand to grab that top shelf bottle of tequila when they can't reach (he's the tall one of the litter lol). But the underlying theme here is that Bakersfield does everything they do with a passion and with customer experience in mind.   5 stars every time! Get the queso!!!"}
{"text":"Nice trendy taco spot in the heart of Cleveland. Great atmosphere, love the picnic tables, and outdoor patio. Parking is kind if a mess, you have to pay to park, in a huge parking lot, but you could only park in one row because the rest is for valet. Staff is friendly and service is slow. Nice little menu of guacs, salads, tacos and tortas. They even make their tortillas in house.   We ordered the elote corn dip, it had a nice little kick and loved the melted cheese on top. Also ordered the short rib torta, amazing! The short rib was tender as all get up, and the flavor was out of this world. It came with a nice smokey chipotle sauce. My wife ordered the mahi taco and the shrimp taco. The tortillas seemed to be under cooked and were very rubbery and uneatable, and the seafood did not have a lot of flavor. To wash it all down we had their fresh squeezed delicious lemonade."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I got the opportunity to go to the soft opening before it was open to the public and had a wonderful experience! This is one of my favorite Cincinnati restaurants and I've desperately been waiting for the Cleveland location to open since I got word of it 2 years ago.  Bakersfield is a completely different spin on tacos than what you're used to. Their menu contains very unique tacos such as braised short rib, pork belly, crispy mahi mahi, and the list goes on.   The first thing you notice when you walk in to Bakersfield is their awesome ambiance and friendly staff. The bartender that greeted us was extremely attentive and personable. He recommended the pineapple margarita that did not disappoint! While he was making our drinks, two other bartenders made sure we had been taken care of. That's great service!   For dinner, we started off with the guac and queso (10/10 recommend) for an appetizer. I don't eat meat so I am a little biased towards the Hongos taco, but it's so delicious! I also had the fish taco which was extremely tasty!   I'm looking forward to making this one of my regular spots from now on!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed to say the least, I am not really understanding the good reviews for this place. Trying to find parking was bad. The decor of the place is cute and the service was very prompt. However I can get better tacos elsewhere in town. I had the pork belly and the short rib taco. They are very small (and expensive for that size) and flimsy, which means almost impossible to eat with your hands.  They should at least have 2 tortillas so that they hold up better. Taste was ok, but they don't come with any sides, no free chips and salsa. I much prefer Maverick Rock Taco."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5 Service-5* Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  This place was phenomenal!! The bartender was nice, patient, and explained everything on their menu and gave me solid recommendations. The bar itself was nice and comfy, usually bar stools aren't so soft.   Down to the meat of things!! Got the chips and guacamole and 3 tacos, the fish mahi mahi, the pork belly and short rib. The tacos came with 2 different sauces, one was kinda of a guacamole kinda flavour and the other had a hint of chipotle. Every single bite changed my view on Mexican food!! The guacamole is simply to die for, and each taco tasted better and better. Squeezing a lime on each was golden. Hands down, the pork belly was the best.  This was my last restaurant I visited in Charlotte and it definitely left the best impression! 5/5, would come back again and bring my girlfriend=)"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I ordered to go and they added the cheese layer on the queso dip!! Previously when they first opened up they skipped out on that part so imagine my disappointment when I got home. However they changed their to go containers to foil ones where they can broil the cheese on top!! Honestly the queso dip is the best thing on the menu (that's all I go for!) but somehow end up with 3 tacos also"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and try the tacos and boy am I disappointed!  We came during happy hour on a Thursday. No happy hour specials. The only thing they offer is a shot for $3 that changes daily. Meh. The drink list isn't exciting either. Much better places to drink downtown.  Service was subpar. Most of the waitstaff stands at the hostess bar mingling amongst themselves. I wasn't impressed.  The food. We got the chips and queso. It's a weird texture. Not really much of a sauce consistency....more like melted cheese.  The TACOS - we ordered 4 different tacos at the table. Nobody finished them. Personally I got the Pollo Rojo and the Mole. They were both OK. For a place that's supposed to be authentic, you couldn't tell. Pgh taco truck has better tacos.  The vibe here is cool and hip but this place is definitely over rated."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday evening, the day before Thanksgiving, a group of 10. This restaurant has two levels and we were seated downstairs. It was fairly crowded and bustling. The lighting and ambience were pretty cool. We ordered some appetizers of which chips and queso was pretty good. There was chips and guacamole and a bowl of chilli as well and those were nice too. Beware of the peppers on top of the queso though. One of them turned out to be really hot!! Following this we ordered some tacos (mole,pollo rojo, hongos (vegetarian), Pork belly pastor). My fiance ordered short rib. The tacos are fairly small in size and each person could eat 2-3 of them. The tostadas were slightly bigger. Our friends ordered Papas and Short rib and some Fish tacos. We also got some wine and and cocktails which were nice. The tacos were juicy and flavorful. It was a nice experience overall. There's free street parking available nearby and some paid parking garages too."}
{"text":"So I'm in Pittsburg for work and I have no idea where to eat. My coworkers and I were thinking of some Mexican food, so up comes yelp and Bakersfield come up as close by and great reviews. We were able to snag a table before it got too busy and I can see why people flock here the food was amazing. They make guacamole every hour and it was some of the best guac I've had and I'm from Southern California. They make the tortillas in house and makes a difference. I had the fish taco which was a delight mix of tangy and spicy. I also tried the papas tostado and it was spicy and delish for those wanting a vegetarian option. I already know on our next trip to Pittsburgh we are coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great house made margs. Tacos are a little small, would recommend getting 2 or 3 and some chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Loved my lunch at Bakersfield! We started with chips and salsa; the chips were perfectly cooked and the salsa was delicious. And the tacos.... tacos! I picked the ones that our server said were the spiciest... definitely spicy but totally doable and so very tasty! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the vibrant Dillworth scene, this Cal-Mex (not really Tex Mex) place has a limited menu but it seems that they do that on purpose to focus in on quality. And the food is definitely quality as they make their own chips, tortillas and breads. We got a boatload of items, starting with the Queso and Chorizo with fresh tortilla chips. Great flavor but we felt it could have used more heat, so we added some of their roasted red pepper sauce. Followed that with their Short Rib Torta, which was outstanding! Super tender and fkavorful....not sure of the arugula though. Next was the Tostada with chicken. That was pretty good, nice flavor especially when adding the fresh lime they give you. Now for the tacos. I know....we're pigs...oink oink oink. Had the Chicken Mole and Pork Pastor. The pork taco was better. Being from Chicago and my buddy being from NYC our definition of Mole is FAR different than Bakersfield's. Their mole jyst didn't have the requisite \"sweet heat\" that defines mole. There was too much chocolate and it wasn't Mexican chocolate. Honestly just not a very good Mole.  Other than that this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Note that you most likely will be sitting family style with strangers....but after the meal you won't be strangers no more."}
{"text":"Bakersfield definitely fills a void in Cleveland. A total different experience from the other taco chain present here. The food is fresh and there is a great attention to detail. Chilled tequila shots with salt already on the rim, bubbling queso (that doesn't appear to come from a melted block of velveeta), and unique taco options with corn tortillas. Looking forward to their patio come summertime!"}
{"text":"When you book a group of 15 at Downtown's hottest new haunt, you don't really know what you're going to get. Will everyone like it...will the service be good for a group...etc. The reviews from my group when were were all said and done were a bit mixed. It seemed like those of us who ordered the Selections of the House ($15/person for a sampling of almost the entire menu) were very pleased. Those who didn't were not pleased. I was among the \"House\" people and I LOVED it. For $15 we were given hearty portions of chips, guac, queso (with a delightful crisped cheese top), a pretty amazing salad, and a variety of tacos including veggie, pork belly, chicken and short ribs. We were all so stuffed, I had leftovers to take home. I also thought our server, JB, was a delight. Those who ordered a la carte seemed a bit disappointed with their meals, and had some concerns over drink mistakes, etc. In addition, it did take us a full 3 hours to get in and out - something to keep in mind if you have time constraints. I would definitely love to go back, but will always come en masse, so that I can take advantage of the Selections menu (for parties of 6+). Thanks, Bakersfield, for an awesome birthday outing!"}
{"text":"First of all - I'm from the Midwest and I find that a lot places in PA are subpar when it comes to customer service and good eats... This would be one of those places, incred!  This place... I ate there on 8/8/17. The background music was way too loud - I could barley hear the waitress when trying to order food. When I did get my food ordered and delivered, the tacos were cold as if the meat had been sitting room temp for hours and the queso was soupy, cottage cheesy, topped with a cheese like Lilly pad, which was pretty unsavory, eek!  I highly recommend going to Tako for good tacos!"}
{"text":"Cool place. A bit expensive when compared to the other popular Cleveland taco spot that starts with a B. But you just need to be mindful that they're different tacos in comparison. Tacos here are on the smaller end on homemade tortillas and fresh simple ingredients. We sampled a few tacos and got some guacamole that was delicious. It's on the chunkier side. Also had to pay for chips and salsa just an FYI... salsas were good though. Margaritas were a 4/5. In conclusion Bakersfield has Good food but is a bit expensive for a taco joint."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a place that I keep coming back to! Being someone who thoroughly enjoys traditional tacos found at places like La Palapa, I also really love the trendy take on the tacos here. I have visited Bakersfield a number of times and have sampled quite a few, but my favorite are the fish and the huitlacoche (corn truffles). As we all know, the guac is to die for. The queso is also really savory and delicious, and surprisingly, the Willie salad is on point as well. I have come here with groups ranging in size from one other person up to a large work function, and I really recommend it!  What really makes this a five star review is how wonderful the staff was when working with me to plan a large work event. We had a party of 16 and they made sure we had enough space, we were semi-privately located downstairs, and we had a variety of delicious food. I really recommend Bakersfield for something like this!"}
{"text":"Come here for their amazing drinks!... after you have eaten dinner. The tacos are overly complicated without punching a lot of flavor. There's barely any heat, even with their hot sauces. The corn tortillas appear to be housemade, but are flaccid and almost worse than if they had just bought them. It was probably the worst part of the taco."}
{"text":"Just came for margs and chips and salsa. There was a long wait for a group our side so we went to the open seating downstairs and got a table right away. A really fun atmosphere and $3 shot of the day made for a great start to the night."}
{"text":"I tried out Bakersfield with a friend before a recent Yelp event in the cultural district. There was a lot to like, and I definitely think we will be back for apps and drinks in the future. The atmosphere was open and down to earth, and the service was very friendly. The communal table thing wasn't weird at all, since we had nice dining companions. I also loved the classic country/rock songs and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly on tv!   The food was what was somewhat of a miss for me, which prevents this from being more than a 3-star review. The chips and salsa were delicious and reasonably priced, so no complaints there. I know I'll want to get those in the future and maybe next time try the guacamole. The tacos were another story though. My friend had the bistec taco, and it looked fine. He said it wasn't too complex in terms of flavors and rather small for the price, but he did like the steak in it. My al pastor taco was very very dry. There's no other way to say it. The meat was drenched in a promising amount of juice that dripped out of both ends of the taco, but each piece of pork was chewy, hard, and dry on the inside. I ended up removing part of the pork because it was nothing but hard, fatty bits. There was also only as much meat as there was pineapple, and the pineapple is supposed to be a topping rather than the main part of the taco. Being a native Californian I have eaten many pastor tacos in my lifetime (the version tako does so wonderfully is a higher-end example, as well as too many to count from little Mexican places) so I know what to expect from one. Hopefully this was a one-time thing, as I plan on giving the tacos here another try, but given their small size I think a better value can be found elsewhere.  Like I said, we will certainly be back (the PBR boot and $3 shot of the day deal is great!) since the chips, salsa, atmosphere, and service were all very good. The cultural district is a tough place to find reasonable app and drink prices after all. I just won't be making this my go-to taco destination with the other options currently available in the city."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant tonight for dinner and had an amazing time, the food was amazing. I had the HUITLACOCHE and HONGOS tacos!! Delicious!! Their queso and chips are the best as well. Our waitress Liz was the best, she was very friendly and welcoming, made our time there 20x better. CANT WAIT TO GO BACK SOON!!"}
{"text":"A bar that serves Mexican foods.  Simple, straight forward and a fun place, especially for small groups of friends.  What makes the menu is the variety of tacos.  A taco is basically a Mexican snack, meal or sandwich filled with different things.  Meats, fish and veggies are standard.  Bakersfield offers tacos like:       Fish (crispy mahi)     Baja Shrimp (crispy shrimp)     Pollo Rojo (Red chicken = braised chicken)     Al Pastor (chili marinated pork)     Cochinita Pibil (achiote braised pork...HOT)     Bistec (marinated grilled short rib)     Short Rib (braised short rib)     Hongos (mushrooms)     Huitlacoche (very special...this is fermented corn, basically a molded corn)       Each taco comes with other items, like cheeses, veggies, etc.  Tostadas, an open-faced taco on a crisp tortilla are available plus tortas or sandwiches, especially a Cuban pressed pork, ham and cheese sandwich.  All of these go down well with beer and cocktails.  Servers and service is great.  Responsive and personal.  Simple concept for a fun occasion."}
{"text":"A very cool atmosphere (try the downstairs area) with very reasonable drink prices on a Friday night. The bartender was very attentive as we waited for a table and the food was amazing although not extensively filling. The tacos are lighter fare, so If you're itching for a large portion, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Guac, Margs, Taco's    We stopped in here for happy hour/dinner and were pleasantly surprised with their specials.  $3-PBR Boots, $3-Tequila shots, and $8-awesome margarita's.  The guac is made fresh every hour and was so good.    I had the Pollo Rojo, Cochinita Pibil, and the bistec (steak).  In my opinion they were all good but the Cochinita Pibil and Bistec stole the show.   That slaw on the Bistec was heavenly!"}
{"text":"Solid spot for tacos. Indoor tables are pretty close together opt for outside if possible. Nice patio with picnic tables. Enjoyable tacos and mix and match options. I have been a few times and always over order because I want to try different options."}
{"text":"If you love tacos tequila and good music then this place is for you.... the service is excellent and the food and drinks are not disappointing.... if you find yourself in Ohio city you have to check out this spot"}
{"text":"In for business and stopped in for a quick taco and a couple of margs.  Great little place, cool theme, great service at the bar and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"What a hopping joint and splendid surprise. While every place on Penn Ave was team with Cinco De Mayo energy last night I can see any that were more supercharged than here. This place has an awesome feel to it as soon as you pass the threshold. The bar is dazzling in itself and the bartenders seemed to be wrangling it effortlessly despite the din. I had to, of course, have a margarita in honor of Mexican independence. I asked for the Bakersfield and it did not disappoint. They were handing of sombrero's as you will see in my pics and it was just a lot of fun energy. I ordered a short rib taco and it was excellent, well balanced with queso fresco ( yum). Chips and verde salsa were also dank. Btw chips and tortilla were definitely house made.   I was told there was a downstairs so I proceeded to check it out. It was a complete throng but it could be expected. Great place"}
{"text":"Tacos are a food group. Good thing as its 75% of the menu here. Tacos are $3-4 each but there is a lot going on in each bite. I loved their guac- chunky guac haters shut your mouth. More for me! Margaritas were on point here and the remodel is amazing. I remember the sticky floor place this used to be. I can't wait for spring for some lovely day drinking."}
{"text":"I ate here this evening with a friend.  It was very busy, so we decided to sit at the bar.  The staff was so attentive and personable. The food was AMAZING.  We each tried three different types of tacos and truthfully, I cannot pick a favorite.  If you go here, make sure you're hungry.  You're not going to want to leave behind a single bite!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We got a drink at the bar first and were immediately greeted by a super friendly bartender. Got some margaritas--which were soooo good! Again, once we were seated, our server greeted us right away, even though we had already had drinks. She went through the menu with us and offered up her favorite tacos (I got her suggestions, and they were so delicious). After dinner we went to the bar area downstairs, and again, great atmosphere and great service! I rarely write yelp reviews, but was so impressed with the service and food at Bakersfield, I had to write one!"}
{"text":"Cool joint, good margaritas. Park next door. Loud. Needs sound panels...or be a lip reader."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had visiting Pittsburgh!  Jessie was very welcoming and the best bartender in town!!!  Good food, great drinks and even better service!"}
{"text":"Soooooo this place is goooooood!  Peppered between some of the popular fixtures on Penn Avenue, Bakersfield serves up noticeably fresh Mexican cuisine in a vibrant and trendy atmosphere.   This is a terrific spot to enjoy with a group of friends who want to \"catch up\" over some cocktails and conversation.    The chips and salsa options - including guacamole - are some good eats.  The salsa comes in a spicy red version and then there's a salsa verde - both on the more watery side, but in a tasty way.  The guacamole is thick and delicious.   As for dining options, steer towards the taco choices.  They're served a la carte so you can pick and choose and the sampling I purveyed were super good.    All in all, this is a great stop in the great location that is Penn Avenue.  Just plan ahead if you can, as there can be a wait at times...but that's the sign that it's worth your time."}
{"text":"Wow!! Amazing!! Our food was delicious!! Awesome customer service also!! Try the Fish tacos!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. I love that I can order one instead of a pair. However, I'm currently devastated that the mole taco was taken off the menu. It was my favorite-by far. Bring it back! Please? I'll beg."}
{"text":"The food, the service and the ambience are all excellent. Can't go wrong with texmex food. They give a verde, spicy and a tomato sauce for the tacos. I took the habanero sauce side for a dollar which is really not required given the sauces provided.  The tacos are around $4 and 2-3 are good enough. The mole taco was delicious with the right amount of sweetness. The pollo rojo was good but I liked the mole better. The huitlacoche is difficult on the tongue to pronounce but yummy on the palate.  The milanesa torta was humongous it tasted really good either verde sauce and the habanero sauce.  Bakersfield margarita was strong and adequate.  Another choice of texmex to compete with the bombas and barrios"}
{"text":"Love love love Bakersfield! As a Cincinnati Bearcat alum now living in The Land, I could not be more excited for them to finally be open here! The pineapple marg was A+, the queso (finally gluten free!) + chips were out of bounds, and the tacos delicious as always. Service was great, especially given it's their first night. I can't wait to go back, again + again + again!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and service. A quick stop in and so pleasant. Megan tended bar and shared information about the area."}
{"text":"Despite its preppy name, this is a Mexican-themed bar with plenty of reasonably authentic offerings like tostadas, tortas, and tacos, even if the staff and patrons skew strongly gringo. If you're on your own, 3 tacos should be more than enough, while if you're here with a group, ordering and sharing generously from all the offerings is a great idea.  Better yet, there's a strong booze program here. Even though the menu might look a bit compact, there are some solid craft beers available, in addition to whatever you'd like to order from the full bar. Service is also friendly, helpful, and fast. Moreover, despite the bar atmosphere, the overall environment didn't seem to be as rowdy or douchetastic as nearby outlets. Yet another great find thanks to all you Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers flavorful dishes that taste fresh and have a nice zip to the taste.  The menu is simple and this allows for a great presentation of food and variety.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Bakersfield has a very nice atmosphere and wonderful comfy seating.  I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here and it was super!!! We came on a Saturday and they had parking at a lot down kenilworth.  We had tacos and they were beyond belief tasty and a total explosion of yumminess in my mouth.  They have me a free tequila shot for my birthday and it was smooth and a very generous shot. Trendy atmosphere I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and solid house margarita. The green sauce they give you to squeeze for yourself is magic. Recommend the carnitas."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for a bachelor party last weekend and it was the perfect spot. The waitress (London) was the best and the rest of the staff was very helpful. The drinks were delicious and the food was really good. We did the $15 per person deal for a large group so it wasn't that expensive either. I highly recommend this place for a big group. They were very accommodating."}
{"text":"2 stars for food and drinks, but ambience saved it. Overall, what a great addition to Penn Avenue. I won't lie, I was hammered everytime I got their tacos, but holy god they were delicious! Then I tried them sober, and maybe it was an off day but the meat was dry and the saving grace was the lime I splattered over it and the cotija.  Ambience is great. This is a great way to start the night with a group friends and then make way over to nearby bars and what not. I like the rustic feel to it with communal tables. However, it can get pretty crowded on weekends and this does make it rather annoying. I don't blame them given the location and inability to accommodate more space or people.  They have a great selection of whiskey, I have to say and was one of the first establishments I've seen in PGH with Corsair whiskey. They even had my favorite, Quinoa Whiskey.   The cocktails were okay, not bad but I would probably head down (or up the street - I still don't know my way around Pittsburgh, even after four years) to Meat and Potatoes for fine cocktails.   Great place for group gatherings, awesome venue to start the night."}
{"text":"I took the whole family to this restaurant.  The margarita was amazing and the whole staff was awesome.  Get the queso.  Very good.  I would love to go back to this place soon"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Bakersfield to anyone for one of the best Jalapeño Margaritas. One pitcher, chips and salsa, and a variety of tacos( they are smaller, gourmet) is the recipe for a great dinner out downtown."}
{"text":"Bakersfield has been on my list to try for awhile now. I was curious to see how it would compare to Barrio since it is such a fan fave. We went for a girls night with 3 of us and unfortunately already had full stomachs when we got there. We had to wait a bit for a table and stood at one of the high tops and ordered drinks while waiting. They had a lot of nice waiting areas that were surprisingly serviced too.   We ordered house margaritas to start. My immediate thought was that they are 2 bucks more than Barrio, but had a little bit more flavor and a lime wedge to go with it. We also ordered the Queso which comes in a cast iron skillet and tasted really fresh. The downfall of coming just for drinks is that they do not give you free chips and salsa to snack on, everything much be purchased. We decided not to have tacos because none of us like corn tortillas and that is all they have.   **special service note: There was an incident while we were there involving a couple that brought in a pizza and thought that they should be allowed to eat it in the restaurant (obviously a huge NO, you'd think that would be obvious..) The staff handled the situation very calmly and professionally, even though the customer was losing his mind and calling   him names (very mature). Once the man left, they even brought the couple that was sharing a high top table with them free drinks for having to deal with that. A very nice touch.  Compared to Barrio: The margs were better quality though more expensive. The atmosphere is a little more upscale and more suitable for a date night. They had more of a broad menu food wise to choose from. TBD on the tacos but I would believe barrios are better (basing this off the tortilla)"}
{"text":"I had been to Penn Avenue once before (in 2015). I had seen that there were LOTS of restaurants on this street within walking distance of the Amtrak station.  So I wondered back here today.  Based on Yelp, I decided to try out this place.  I had the guacamole and chips.  Excellent;  loved the chunks of avocado.  Then had two different tacos,  which this restaurant is known for. Loved the pollo rojo taco.  The pork belly taco was pretty good too. I topped it off with a pineapple margarita.  Pineapples are one of my b favorite fruits,  so I really liked this twist on a traditional margarita.  Downside: a bit too noisy for me. If you want to have a conversation with someone,  this isn't the best place to come. As I was by myself,  I could cope."}
{"text":"Listen up large parties! The best deal in Cleveland on Tacos is about to be revealed! Get yourself 5 or more friends and order the \"Selecciones De La Casa\". You will think (Like us), \"How much food are they really going to bring us for $15 per person?\". You will not be able to finish it and it will be awesome. The $3 tequila shots and amazing service were just icing on this tasty Mexican cake! Big thanks to super on the ball waiter JB, the bartenders, and the whole Bakersfield staff. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey. How could that combo be bad?   I was truly hoping that Bakersfield could be \"the\" place that replaced the likes of Pinche Taco in Denver. The evening didn't start well. Parking is a hot mess but that is just the area. They do offer complimentary valet out of the Berrybrook lot across the street. Limited street parking is it for people that aren't keen on valet.  We started with a Don Julio tequila flight, a cerveza and chips & guac ($7). Honestly, I found it irritating that chips and salsa weren't gratis. I really enjoyed the guac. It was super chunky with the right amount of lime, salt and cilantro. They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos, so I sampled those with chips. The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland. The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness.   We ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor, fish taco, short rib, and a spicy pork. They were served family style on a platter. The food had a visual appeal but none of them blew me away. Especially for $4 a pop.   Overall, they were close to meeting the 4 star mark. Drop the prices and bring me chips & salsa on the house."}
{"text":"Lovely design and atmosphere. It is very inviting and social. Loved their whiskey selection and the red headed stranger was delicious. Their manhattan was okay until you ate some spicy tacos. The spice really brought out the sweetness and taste in the drink. I recommend getting this if you are eating. I went there with my SO, he had a short rib torta (very tasty) and I had the fish, pastor, and conchinita tacos.. all very good. They had fresh salsa and their queso app is delicious... I want that in and around my mouth, always.   This spot has had quite a few failed attempts in the past few years but I feel bakersfield may be able to break that curse. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Super Busy when we went, no parking lot BUT def worth it. Great Tacos and yummy margaritas"}
{"text":"Firstly, Kelsey took care of us and we were a late crew so she was very accommodating and so sweet. We all had various tacos and I have to recommended the \"pollo rojo.\" Also, the willie salad was amazing and their selection of tequila is fantastic and reasonably priced. Thanks, Kelsey for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"As a SoCal transplant, I can say authoritatively that this is the best Mexican in Cleveland - puts places like Barrio and Momocho to shame. The cochinita pibil and the hongos tacos are special, as is the guacamole. Margaritas are great. Everything is thoughtfully seasoned and presented. Kale slaw is my new obsession.  The service does leave a bit to be desired, though. They are nice -- but we have been here a few times and have gotten free food (without asking) each time because the service was super slow. While it's nice of Bakersfield to get ahead of the issue by comping our meal, it's not a very good business model. Tightening up the service would work wonders for a place that's otherwise got a cool vibe and delicious food."}
{"text":"On Friday night, around 6:45, John and I decided to try out Bakersfield before the Guster show at the arts festival.  I completely agree with Rachel that there is a lot of awesome tacos out there in Pittsburgh, so with that in mind, we sunk our teeth into some more.   The wait was about 20 minutes, but with the show about to start and us running late, we opted to sit at the bar.  I had the house margarita and John had a beer that he said was a bit off from the bottle taste.  My margarita was good.  Lots of salt.  Nice mix of sweet and tart.  Then we headed into the guac and chips.  I was a huge fan of the guac!  It was really limey which I love and the chips were warm.    For the tacos, I got the short rib and the spicy pork, John opted for the pork belly and the chicken.  They were very beautiful, but they were also very small.  While it's not a fair comparison, to me, these were subpar when compared to Las Palmas, the greatest taco place in the city.  If you don't do the comparison, these are some pretty good tacos.  But they were tiny and I was hungry.  Three bites and they were gone!  The spicy was definitely nice and spicy, the pork belly was sweet with a wonderful kick from the pineapple, the chicken was decent and the short rib was very flavorful.  But for $4 a piece, I left just wanting a bit more.    I definitely want to go back to try the tortas and the salads which look awesome.    All in all, very good, but just can't beat Las Palmas."}
{"text":"I will never make a trip to Pittsburgh without coming here for tacos! We are from out of state and just can't find a place we like as much in CT. Every one I tried was great! I read a couple reviews on here about them being small but they are the typical size of street tacos."}
{"text":"Really good tacos.  We went at lunch.  The place was empty, but they took good care of us.  The tacos were creative and tasted really good.  Interesting choices on the fillings and toppings, but they worked.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Place has nice trendy atmosphere. Ordered a beer, short rib taco and pork taco. Shells were fresh and tasty. Presentation was great. Meat was dry    Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm actually updating my review I left a couple of months ago after a previous bad experience. Their owner, Brain, heard about my bad experience and sent me a gift card on the house to try Bakersfield again. Boy am I glad I did!  My husband and I went their on a Friday night for dinner and there was a hour wait. We didn't mind so we sat at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a Bakersfield margarita and my husband got a seasonal draft. In addition, we started with the queso/chips and added the chorizo! Man was it good! It came hot on a iron skillet and was out within 5 minutes of ordering. The queso was very different from your typical mexican restaurant (more rich tasting), but it was delightful. Our bartenders were very nice and were constantly filling our waters and making sure our drinks were full.  Once we got seated we decided to do the whole shabang and order 1 of each taco. My favorite was the short-rib and my husband loved the pork belly. The tacos are tapas size, but they were loaded with toppings. My least favorite was the fish. Note to self- 2-3 tacos is ENOUGH lol :-)  Overall, we had a good experience at Bakersfield and I'm glad I gave it a second try. This was my husbands first time and he really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend coming here again for date night or as a nice pre-game place with a group of friends for some drinks and tacos!  PREVIOUS REVIEW: I was really excited to try Bakersfield because my Columbus, Ohio friends raved about it, however I left disappointed. I came here for lunch on a Friday with about 6 coworkers. Please keep in mind the restaurant was not busy. Anyways, our server took about 15 minutes to even come over and greet up. After we ordered our drinks, we had to ask 2 times for him to bring out oranges with our beer.   The chips and salsa were also not complimentary which always amazes me at 'Mexican' restaurants. Or our server just lied to us because every other table around us had chips. Who knows! Anyways, we all ordered various tacos. Once they arrived, nearly 30/45 minutes later, they all came together on one giant plate which was fine, but the server had no idea which tacos were what. So we had to magically guess which one. I still think I got the wrongs tacos, but they were tasty. They are very small so if your hungry this might not be a good pick for you.   After we were finished our waiter seemed to disappear. Not even the other waiters could find him. Meanwhile the tables next to us cleared. Finally we found our mysterious waiter and when he brought us the checks they were all wrong. We asked him to revise them and he brought them back wrong again. Then the THIRD time. Yes THIRD time they were wrong again! Seriously dude. We were at lunch for 2 hours for 1 beer and 2 tacos. A little ridiculous.   I only gave this place a 3 because the food was good, however the service was horrible. The environment of Bakersfield is cool and I've heard nothing but good things.   I would like to give it another try however my first impression was not a positive one."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte! You have to go and ask for Chelsea! She is so nice and the food is just as good (if not better) I love coming here! Thank you Bakersfield and Chelsea for the amazingggg experiences!!"}
{"text":"Went to Bakersfield for dinner last night.  It was our first time there.  Our server, Tyler,  was wonderful.  He answered all of our questions about the food on the menu.  He was very polite, friendly and made our dining experience great.  We got to talk to the manager, Eric.  He was so nice.  Answered questions we had about tequila and the appetizers.   Food was awesome! Would definitely recommend this place to others!  We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've never left disappointed! Their tacos are packed with flavor (pork belly pastor - highly recommended) and the perfect size. Their guacamole and two sauces they bring to the table are amazing. This is one of my favorites downtown."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I was super hesitant because it's located Downtown and to me, that means that my first thought is \"over priced\". But no. This place was pretty sweet. We sat in the downstairs area, near the awesome mural on the wall of the last supper but with skeletons. Our server was wonderful and attentive to our large party for the evening. To start, we had the queso and OMG was the queso amazing. SO much flavor - we loved it. They had PBR in boots on special and $5 shots of tequila (I forget the brand, but I know it was not bottom shelf). The tacos are small- like two bites each, but they have a ton of flavor. I ordered the pollo rojo (braised chicken, smoky guajillo chili salsa, queso fresco, white onion, chipotle lime crema, cilantro) and the mole (oaxacan style braised chicken, pickled red onion, queso fresco, cilantro) tacos- both were wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly one and loved it. I also ordered the milanesa which is classified as a torta and was UNbelievable.It was a chicken cutlet, black beans, salsa verde, arugula, avocado lemon mayo on a telera roll. DELICIOUS. This place is awesome, great service, very affordable and super tasty. Check it out, now."}
{"text":"Thanks for the margs, queso, and throwing that drunk dude out who groped my leg. Not the usual clientele, but you guys handled it fast and with little disruption to everyone else's night. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Margaritas were tasty but weak. That's the only even partly positive comment I can make. Started with queso add chorizo. Flavorless. Grainy. Not good... Considered leaving after that but wanted to at least try a taco. Each of us--my husband and myself--ordered one taco. He got mole, I got pollo rojo. They came out extremely fast but were cold and tasted just like the queso--flavorless and grainy. Service was horrible too. We were there around 11pm after a Pirates game. Perhaps late night isn't their specialty...? I'm not sure... But I do know I would NEVER go back to this place!"}
{"text":"\"We don't show sports.\"  I was one of 5 people in the bar and given this response when I asked the bartender if she could turn on the television. Interesting level of smugness when trying to establish yourself in a city desperate to build its downtown. Probably not the right approach and well, that's the last time I visit this bar."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, my favorite new restaurant in the Burgh. I started with the basic house margarita, which is made special through the use of fresh squeezed lime and lemon juices...just amazing.  The guacamole is simply amazing, brightly flavored and nicely chunky, topped with the delightful addition of thinly sliced radishes.  I had both the steak and short-rib tacos, and both were delicious, in fact, the short-rib one was one of the best items I have eaten anywhere.  The friend I was with is a vegetarian, and got both the Huitlacoche taco and a potato tostada, both of which he declared fantastic.  There are two table sauces, a nice creamy green including cilantro and avocado, and a red with a real nice slow burn on it.  One added bonus...every day there is a featured shot for $3, usually either bourbon or tequila, and one can always get a \"boot\" of ice-cold PBR for $3.  Do NOT miss this place!!! It is simply AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here didn't go so well, but I was impressed with how hard the staff worked to make it right. I know this restaurant is busy and popular and would do just fine without my patronage; but Jeff, the manager, really went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. I really liked the fish tacos, the pork belly is a knockout."}
{"text":"Small ala carte tacos that are delicious and have really good toppings. Favorites - the mahi mahi and the steak. And for vegetarians, the corn/mushroom taco. Good atmosphere, high tables, low light."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have nothing good to say.  I have been to places with much better food, service and value in Charlotte.  The tacos you receive are about the size of a large cookie and they are $3-$4 EACH...and that does not include any sides.  No beans, no rice.  Nothing.  They are more along the lines of what you get on a dollar taco night somewhere.  They were cold - not that tacos are ever served extremely warm, but these were cold in a not good way.  Unlike any other mexican themed restaurant I have been to, you pay for the chips and salsa.  What I find more confusing, rather than frustrating, is that they GIVE you two bottles of salsa.  But when the chips come to the table, they contain two dishes of the same salsa.  It makes no sense.  Let me get on to the presentation....what you order is served family style.  6 of ordered tacos, some with special requests.  Instead of being served individually, the server points out what is what on the giant pizza tray of tacos.  The special order ones had toothpicks in them.  So there were were, sliding our tacos off the tray and onto our plates.  I could go on, but I just won't go back.  I had a sweet tea and 3 tacos and my total with tip was $18.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.  Good luck Bakersfield.  You are a rip off in every way."}
{"text":"I'm doing three stars for now until I visit again. We went on a Sunday a little after lunch time and there was barely anyone in there on the gorgeous day. We got to sit near the garage doors and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely!  For a really small crowd the drinks took a long time, that makes me nervous for when they are really busy.  The food and drinks are great though....expensive but thats expected in their prime location. They only serve homemade corn tortillas which I'm not a huge fan of so its difficult to find alternative options in such a limited menu. However, the tostada looked amazing that my sister got and I would totally smash that next time! The chips and salsa are generous portions for the price and the chips came out warm and crispy! Drinks....wow they are fresh and flavorful. The sangria and bakersfield margarita were to die for. Not too sweet but still full of fruity flavor.  We will come back, gorgeous interior and great location a little way off from the hustle and bustle by west side market. Having indoor/outdoor seating is a plus and our server was friendly!"}
{"text":"I really liked Bakersfield in Columbus and was glad to see one in Pittsburgh. Quality tacos. I got the pork belly, fish, and short rib today. The short rib was nice and juicy with a generous helping of meat. The fish was the true standout flavorwise and its rare to find good fish tacos in Pittsburgh. The pork belly was the only underwhelming one I wouldn't repeat. It was chewy, which is the exact opposite of the buttery texture I expect in pork belly. And it lacked much flavor other than pineapple. I look forward to going back when I can properly indulge in their margaritas and extensive tequila list"}
{"text":"Really fresh food, good service, great drinks. Get the margarita and the guac and chips. New place, worth a check out! We enjoyed ourselves, liked it downstairs!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I popped in to Bakersfield for lunch recently, undaunted by a Mexican restaurant with the most un-Mexican name ever.  The experience was very hit-or-miss.  The space is inviting, with high ceilings and a large open bar area.  Along the other side of the wall are several picnic-style tables.    The menu is fairly small, with a small selection of appetizers mostly consisting of condiments for tortilla chips, a few tortas, some salads, and a selection of tacos.  We ordered a selection of stuff for our chips, including salsa, guacamole, and queso.  The queso was good, but a bit odd.  It seemed like a bed of mealy cheddar and jack made whipped into a thick roux, covered in a broiled layer of cotija.  It had an odd mouthfeel, and wasn't obviously great, but there was something about it that was compelling.  The salsas were good, including a sweet and spicy salsa verde and a chipotle-laden red salsa.  Most of us really liked both, but the sole Brit in our party thought that the chipotle salsa was bland.  An Englishman calling something bland??  It was good for a few laughs.  The guacamole was superb, with chunks of fresh avocado, and just the right acidity.  Very good.  The tacos are generally pretty decent.  The pork belly is flavorful, thanks to the pineapple, though I was a bit disappointed to find that the fat that makes pork belly so awesome was trimmed, off, and we were left with just cubes of defatted meat.  The fish was amazing, and the cochinita pibil was pretty good.  The misfire was the corn taco, which had a nice zip, but had an odd, almost soggy texture.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the service.  Our server was friendly, but the service was painfully slow.  Among the 5 of us, we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and a pint of beer.  All of it took 25 minutes to arrive.  By the time we got our margaritas, our food had arrived.  What a shame, too, since we probably would have ordered another pitcher if the first hadn't taken so long.  Also, the tacos came out on a big pan, with multiple orders on the same pan.  Why couldn't they put them on individual plates instead of forcing us to reach across the table to grab our tacos?  All in all, Bakersfield is decent, but a few things hold it back from being truly excellent."}
{"text":"Yes!  There's something comforting knowing that there is a great taco place that serves tequila and whiskey drinks in the heart of Pittsburgh. The tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice outdoor setting if weather is good. Prices weren't to bad alcohol was higher then most.  I would definitely recommend this place and will be returning"}
{"text":"Finally ate here. The name says Bakersfield Penn but it's a taco bar.....   The place has two floors but is packed solid on the weekends with an hour wait.  They have a small menu of Mexican food and tacos. I tried the Fish, Bistec and Huitlacoche tacos. The fish taco was good but not as flavorful as the others.  Pros: They were the most FLAVORFUL tacos I ever ate!  Cons: These were the TINIEST tacos I ever ate! Why are they so tiny? Why can't they be big? Huh? Why????"}
{"text":"My friend and I love this place!  We always start with chips & queso and move on to some $4.00 tacos!  The salsa is amazing too.  They run a loop of Clint Eastwood movies downstairs and have daily specials on whiskey.  Great customer service.  Manager just came over and asked how everything was.  Thanks Bakersfield!!!"}
{"text":"I am so upset. Bring back the bistec. Bakersfield Changed their menu and I've never felt so hurt and betrayed. The bistec taco was the best taco I've ever had and I have been eating it regularly for years. I don't even consider going to other restaurants because I just want the bistec..but now Bakersfield removed it from their menu???? Why did u do this to us! It had to have been a best seller. Please correct this mistake. I felt privileged to have known the bistec but I'm not ready to stop eating it every week.. please do something!!! I'm begging you!! I also thought the sesamo special was the other best taco I've ever had in my life and now that's gone too!!!! Whyyyyyyy!   Overall Bakersfield has an awesome vibe, great food, great spicy margs but they need to give the people what they want if they expect to keep business. You can't tease us like this. Please!"}
{"text":"In town visiting and decided to give Bakersfield a try on a busy Saturday night. Put our name on the wait list via Yelp (1.5 hours) and took a leisurely stroll over to the restaurant for some pre-meal beverages. We ended up getting a spot to eat in the basement bar and had some of the best food in Pittsburgh. The chips and guacamole came first and was splendid: thin and crisp chips with rich guacamole and some slight heat. Then the tacos: my coworker tried the Cochinita Pibil, the Bistec, and the Short Rib. I tried the Hongos and the Huitlacoche. The flavors of each were rich and complex, some spicy and some refreshing. 2-3 tacos each was more than enough to eat. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite since I was staying across the street. The bourbon flight was fantastic and the fish tacos were excellent. Very crispy and delicious. The chips and salsa were also very good. Green delicious salsa.   The only downside was somewhat slow service at the bar. I was sitting at the bar and I had to ask twice to order food and twice to close out my tab. It wasn't even very busy. Not horrible service at all as the bartenders were very friendly."}
{"text":"Eating at the Bakersfield Mexican Resturaunt in Ohio City.  Really gormet stuff and quite tasty if you like Mexican.  Get the guacamole... really good!"}
{"text":"Probably the best margaritas I have ever had in my life. Chips and queso were delicious and tacos were yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm with Jona - I don't think Clevelanders (?) know what a good taco tastes like.   I was very excited to try this place when visiting, as I am from Texas and the place lists itself as \"Tex-Mex.\" First of all, hell to the nah, they are NOT tex-mex. Not even some kind of bastardized version, either.   Let's start with that so-called queso. It's a blend of chihuahua (yes) and cheddar (NO). Never in a million years would you make a queso with cheddar - it's responsible for that gritty texture, because it's not meant to be melted in quantity. There are so many better Mexican cheeses to be used for queso, and if Mexican is too exotic for a Mexican restaurant, there's always Velveeta (seriously, many of us make queso from Rotel and Velveeta, poor man's queso, if you will).  On to the tacos. They are really expensive, given their size. Almost everything on the menu has a pickled (read: very vinegar) item on it, which is a bit strange. I was pleased to see double corn tortillas, but the consistency was wrong for corn (too gelatinous). The fillings weren't much better. Mole should knock your socks off with flavor, yet there was hardly any flavor to be found on the chicken mole taco. I could apply that critique to all the tacos - if you focused really hard, you might detect a drive-by of a flavor, but not anything that lingers too long. They were like an integral approaching flavor but never quite reached it.   Lastly, there's the bill...way too much money for not flavorful, tiny tacos.   Oh crap, I forgot one of the most important parts - the ambience was SO bizarre! Is this how Midwesterners think of Texas or Mexico? The interior was nice and forward and on the hipster side, but old country blasted while the TVs ran Tombstone. It was really confusing."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Somewhat noisy on weekends nights but that's to be expected with great food and great beer"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is an interesting restaurant.  The tacos are boring. I haven't been impressed. If you want good tacos, go to Tako down the street (if you can get in) or Reyna in the Strip District.  What is fantastic are the salads. Bakersfield salads are amazing. Great lettuce, great toppings, great portion, great price. I'm a regular for the salads.  The drinks are good. I wish the drink specials were all mezcal or tequila and a PBR rather than whiskey on some days, but it isn't a big deal."}
{"text":"I was indeed slightly manic, feeling triumphant over my sudden decision to visit a restaurant, to which I would usually feel such strong aversion. I felt prepared for the ride. Though I've had a rough time with taco restaurants several times in the past, my last handful of experiences had been quite controlled and delightful, almost disappointingly so. This trend was utterly broken.  Within 10 minutes of entering, something happened. I'm still not quite sure what it was, there was some sort of contradiction or impossibility in my conscious experience.  One early event I recall was feeling like there were bits of vomited meat somewhere in my head, in a place where there should never be a sense of taste.  I reached out for my trusty bucket that I bring with me to restaurants but then I was overcome with the ridiculous belief that I had already thrown up, and was somehow rewinding reality as I reached for my bucket.  From this started my slide into absolute insanity, a complete loss of my sense of reality.   My memory faded in and out, flashes of salsa, bickering housewives, beer-gulping drunkards, academics, margaritas, and braised meats appeared and disappeared from my vision for what felt like an eternity. How and when I got home I do not remember."}
{"text":"Like a one night stand with a half rate hooker--it got the job done but I didn't feel great afterward.  Overpriced taco fare with guacamole that pales in comparison to what I can make at home.  I will say I was amazed at the tequila selection, it's nice to see a place where patron is considered second class (because it should be).  We tried every taco, and the only one I'd write home about was the spicy Mahi."}
{"text":"This was my second visit.  My first visit some time ago involved mostly good food and drinks, but a rotten fish taco.  So I was a little worried when I ordered the fish taco again but this time it was delicious.  Nice energy in the place, great decor and comfortable seats, food and drinks were excellent, and service could be a little better.  Tried four tacos and all were decent serving size for the price (when compared against other Charlotte competitors).  The ingredients looked bright and fresh.  The flavors and textures in the tacos stood on their own and made each one taste really good.  The tostada was excellent and the highlight of the food.  Crispy, savory, yummy! Te Pollo Rojo and the Fish were my two favorite tacos.  The Cochinita Pibil was too hot for me and it basically kicked my ass.  The Short Rib was tender and tasty.  The salsa verde they give you deserves it's own special mention.  This stuff is so darn good.  You will want to put it on everything at the table.    Servers were friendly but could have been a bit more attentive.  I visited on a Thursday and the place was jammin by 7:30pm.  There's a reason they're having success in a location where many others struggled."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town. Been coming here regularly since the week after they opened and have always been satisfied.  The servers are attentive and kind even when they are slammed.   Every Time I order the Cochinita Pibil taco they let me know how spicy it is that particular day which is great for two reasons: one, they are aware of what they're serving and, two, it means the marinade or sauce is made fresh.   In fact, everything tastes fresh. Their green salsa tastes like fresh cut grass in the best way possible.  Also, anytime I bring in a new friend or the night is busy and service is even slightly slow, they make the effort to give a free app or drink to show they want my business.  They will have my business as long as I'm in town and they're here!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield wasn't what we were expecting. We were thinking about enchiladas and chili replenish.  The menu was quite different. The Mexican chili was outstanding along with the corn chowder. Cheap shots also a plus!"}
{"text":"great gauc  awesome pineapple marg  solid tacos, but small  nice location  will like to explore more  good for groups"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal! I love the taco combinations and the salsas. The queso is great but the texture is different than what I'm used to. The wait is always super long but they're on no-wait which makes getting a table do-able, even on a busy friday or saturday night. The only complaint I have is that the service isn't always great. I've had mixed experiences.. I've had great service with super friendly waiters and bartenders and I've always had just mediocre service where we weren't given things we asked for multiple times. Still a GREAT place to try and some of my favorite tacos in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in late, starving - and thankfully they were open!  *Their kitchen is open late*  We both ordered some tacos and a few drinks, they had a special deal on their tequila shots so of course we had to partake.   I had a beer, modelo, and my friend had a margarita.  The beer was good, and the margarita was also pretty good.   The tacos were AMAZING.  They were absolutely delicious.   And the atmosphere was great.  Very relaxing, very laid back, and very comfortable.  I would definitely come back.  Also our server was great! Very attentive, and very friendly.    If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I'm coming back here :)"}
{"text":"Checked this place out the other day and I was glad I did.  Service was on point as well as my waiter's recommendations. Came here with a group of 8 and we all ordered different items off the menu along with their chips, guac, & queso.  Great place for some good tacos, items on the tacos were fresh and they all had unique tastes.  Place was packed when I was here....   one of the things I liked a lot was that they had table seating, seats at the bar and also tables you can stand around where you can order drinks and food.  Careful though, mama says when you stand and eat, you could get your cloths dirty.  Def check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is very quaint and a nice mecican place.  It looks like good deals on margarita pitchers.  The banjo music is what drove us away in the end."}
{"text":"Welcome to Cleveland, Bakersfield! Husband and I are Thunderdome groupies from Cincinnati, but since my parents live in Cleveland, we are up here a lot. We were beyond excited to hear that Bakersfield was finally going to be opening in Ohio City.   The service, as with any restaurant in this group, was outstanding. Our server, Hailey (perhaps spelled differently....sorry, girl!), was so helpful and had great energy from start to finish.   Drinks came out quick! Margarita and lemonade were super fresh, and the bottled local beer was exactly as expected.   The guacamole was well-balanced and appropriately salted. I DESPISE under-salted guac. I mean, why bother? The bottled salsas were flavorful provided a some variety when the guac ran out.   The chicken milanesa (torta) was juicy and had more flavor than any chicken sandwich I've ever had. My dad loved it. He was downright angry that it was too big to finish. Tacos were on point. Full enough to balance out the tortilla, but not breaking the tortilla. They sure know what they're doing in the kitchen. Our toddler enjoyed fruit and cheese quesadillas along with bites of our food and a messy plateful of guacamole and chips.   Everything was outstanding. Go before it gets crazy. Cincinnati wait times will surpass 2 hours....and we wait for these tacos. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We came back to Bakersfield with our friends and their kids before we checked out the holiday festivities in market square. We checked No Wait before we made the 15 minute drive into town and it said \"Come on in,\" but when we got there they said the wait was an hour. They admitted they were having problems with No Wait. We put our names in anyway hoping we could keep the kids busy long enough, then the hostess came over and told us she was going to get us a table because she has kids and she saw the predicament we were in. It was so nice and considerate of her. Then once seated, while we were enjoying our appetizers, the manager offered each of us adults a complimentary shot of tequila. I don't know if it was because he saw we were the only people with kids in the whole place or what, but it was a nice gesture on top of what the hostess already did for us. Beyond all of this great hospitality, the food was yet again amazing."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Bakersfield's tacos. My go to is two tacos if the table is sharing chips and any dips, their chorizo queso and short rib tacos are to die for. I highly recommend getting chips along with your meal"}
{"text":"Stopped here late one evening during a conference stay in the city. Although I did not try an entree, the appetizers and mixed drinks were amazing! I think this place had the best guacamole I've ever tasted that was incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly. They also either make their own tortilla chips or I'm not sure, but they were delicious and served warm out of the oven. Waitress was very friendly and made excellent recommendations for food and mixed drinks. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for a night out in downtown Pittsburgh. It's bigger than it looks and is definitely a cool atmosphere. It was a little expensive for my wallet in term of being able to drink there all night. But the tacos were to die for !"}
{"text":"The wait is long, but the food is definitely worth it.  Lunazul is a smooth tequila shot and the pineapple margarita is my favorite.  I just hate you can't be added to the waiting list until you're within 10 miles of the location."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my boyfriend for a quick bite. Ordered a pineapple margarita and he ordered a beer. Started with queso and quac and ordered one of every taco on the menu. The food was delicious but the real reason for this review is our server. Nathanael was absolutely phenomenal. From the moment he approached our table, I was immediately pleased. Nathanael asked if we had ever been to Bakersfield before. When we told him we hadn't, he went through the whole menu and pointed out his favorites. He was attentive and friendly. The food came out quick and was good."}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks served by a middle aged hipster who is not friendly at all.  The person who appeared to be the main bartender lacked the basic social skills that are required when you work with the public.  \"Please\" and \"thank you\" would be a good start. Then maybe we could move on to more complex things like \"welcome\" and \" thank your for coming in today\". Nodding and pointing after making someone feel like an unwanted burden may cut it in a college bar on a Saturday night but it is wholly inappropriate for an upscale restaurant on a not so busy Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is my new favorite restaurant in the city right now. I have had some of the best food and service i have ever had. Everyone is so friendly and takes time to make sure you get the best experience and food. ESPECIALLY our server Beans! She is a fantastic server and knows exactly how to make it a fun time! Definitely go check it out! I would recommend anything on the menu. My favorite item is the Papas!"}
{"text":"Good margaritas! Chips were fresh, guacamole was good but i didnt like how chunky it was. I thought the tacos were great! (Bistec steak, PORK BELLY PASTOR, and short rib)   Did not like the tortilla shells."}
{"text":"Bakersfield, generic name notwithstanding, is an excellent Ohio City eatery filled with some of the must culturally appropriated, mouthwateringly delicious Mexicanish grub you're likely to find in the Midwest. Yes, it's a chain, but it's a baby chain with only something like 8 locations, so ease up. At its queso-covered core, Bakersfield is a taco joint. That's not to say that they haven't managed to toss in a few surprises along the way - achiote braised pork, huitlacoche (Google it you lazy bastard), and a beer-braised carnitas torta? You betcha.  The atmosphere is rather cozy, but they've managed to cram seating into just about every nook and crannie. I say this because there's a good chance you will be sitting practically on top of your noshing neighbors if you happen to get there whenever they're hoppin, which is most times. The bar is nice for eating, no annoying ledge, and there are some picnic sized low tops and a patio, but the inside is tight. And loud. Did I mention you're gonna need some lozenges after you're done eating. So damn loud. Moving on.  As others have already mentioned, the service is pretty spot on. We've never had anything but friendly, attentive service during all of our visits and this is both table and bar seating. That being said, the place is pretty chill and it is Cleveland, so don't expect high-brow snooty. It's more like barista cool with service industry chops.  As far as the bar's concerned, if you get all drippy over hundreds of different tequilas (unlike me) you're gonna be in heaven in this place. They claim to have over 100 tequilas and American whiskies, but I don't drink either so take your queries to a more qualified gent then me. They've also got margaritas, the sports drink of choice for middle-aged soccer moms everywhere. Beer-wise, it's OK. They've got 8 taps, some wasted on garbage like PBR and those Modelo messes, but some featuring some tasty crafts local and not. Nothing to get the beer geek in my going, but enough to slake my thirst whilst I'm grubbing.  Speaking of grubbing, here's where I can't stop having nasty thoughts about Bakersfield. Short. Rib. Tostada. Let that sink in. This has to be one of the greatest things I've shoved into my face in decades and it's what I get every time I pay Bakersfield a visit. It's crispy tortillas, black beans, smoky house made hot sauce, queso fresco, shredded romain, cilantro buttermilk dressing and, the coup de gras, sinfully tender short rib topped with a perfectly fried egg. Sorry, I distracted myself. Where was I. Just get it. Don't even think about it. It'll make your innards do a Mexican hat dance. Wait, is that racist?  Their tacos are a bit of all over, but in a good way. They've got 9 standard options including tasty bits like braised chicken, chili marinated pork, and, of course, short rib and typically a few specials that rotate regularly. I've had every one of them and the ingredients are always fresh, crispy when they're supposed to be and not when their not. I love the smoky character in their hot sauce and the liberal use of picked veggies. They're just damn tasty. Here's my problem with them - raw tortillas. Yes, they make their own flour tortillas in house and this is a good thing, but they are never toasted. Toss those bad boys over some flames for a bit and magic happens. Otherwise they just sorta taste like, well, like raw flour. This is the only thing stopping these tacos from being exceptional. I hope you're taking note, Bakersfield.  Now, I wouldn't go as far as to say that Bakersfield is awesome, mind-blowing or life-changing, but I will say this. Bakersfield has carved out a niche for themselves in the city. Sure, they're up against Bomba, Boracco, El Carnicero, and Barrio, but I have a feeling they'll easily be able to hold their own. Besides, there's not much Mexican cuisine to speak of in Ohio City anyway."}
{"text":"Their braised short rib (beef) tacos are sooooo good. Plus they make their own tortillas, and their tortillas are honestly amazing as well. I want to come back here again to get more short rib tacos, and $4 per taco is fair. A satisfactory meal ends up costing around $8, though if you're a guy you'd probably get 3 tacos instead of 2."}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield twice. They have great tacos and apps and I love their guacamole. The second time we ate there we were placed downstairs. The music was way too loud we couldn't even hold a conversation. Our server messed up our order (probably due to the fact that she didn't hear our order). The downstairs also smelled a little funky. Next time I go I'll ask to wait the extra time to eat upstairs!"}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this place, but honestly, you're better off going to Taco Bell. I've tried more than once to like this place and everything about it says BASIC! Basic taste, terrible queso, and warm salsa. I would not and will never recommend this place to anyone. Bland. Bland. Bland. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Tonight I experienced the best guacamole and service of my life. Our waiter was Luke, and I can't speak highly enough of his kind service. 10/10 recommend, ask for Luke!!"}
{"text":"One word: WOW. I had no idea that by stepping in here on a whim and a quest for bomb tacos, that I would've found my new favorite taco joint!   Not only is the food here amazing, fresh, and packed with flavor-- but our server David (older guy with glasses and a love for the classics!) really made my first experience here not only memorable, but also entertaining. He went above and beyond to provide my friend and I with a warm and friendly experience, but you could really tell he genuinely loved working here and was super passionate about the menu and suggested the most delicious tacos and apps!  I ordered a Tecate to start with their famous guacamole and some queso. The queso was okay, but the guacamole and the red chipotle dipping \"sauce\" (aka salsa) we're out of this world phenomenal!! For tacos I ordered the short rib (by far the most tasty thing I've ever consumed), a pollo roja, and a pork taco with habanero sauce and black beans (definitely spicy and I'm a spice fiend!). The best taco I had was the short rib! I can't wait to come back and order 40. Every taco I had was extremely flavorful and loaded with bright ingredients, with a yummy hand made corn tortilla!   I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Just because everyone is getting tacos does not mean you have to follow along! Out of all the items on the menu, you will not be disappointed by the chicken tostadas! I normally don't like slaw, however, the shredded romaine slaw on top of all the ingredients really brings out the flavor of the meal and was just refreshing, bite after bite! It's a decent portion for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We stopped in today while taking a break from the hospital and the tacos were out of this world. Nice beer selection. The guacamole is the best I have EVER had, amazing!!! Every taco we had was fantastic. Awesome spot!!!"}
{"text":"FISH TACOS! Do I have your attention? What can I say... this place brings out the best, worst part of me. I eat until I can't move anymore and then I somehow still want more! Affordable menu and the drink specials are too good for us all. Fish tacos, guys. Anytime of year will be an enjoyable experience but summer time is wheee the memories are made. Sit on the patio when the sun won't shine directly in your eyes, sip a margarita and enjoy a taco... a fish taco."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with four friends on a Friday (we were taking an \"early weekend\"), and it was a great experience! The wood-based decor created a rustic and casual feel, and the spacious layout - featuring picnic tables, booths, and opening garage doors - was inviting and unique.  Of course, the delicious food also helped. We couldn't choose between Chips & Guacamole and Chips & Queso w/ Chorizo, so we got both to start (the perks of large parties!) and they were both terrific. We then split an artistic platter of tacos that included Fish (citrusy mahi), Mole (savory braised chicken), and the unanimous favorite, Pork Belly Pastor (very juicy, flavorful mix of sweet and spicy).  Overall, Bakersfield was a fun, casual dining experience with well-presented and delicious tacos. I will definitely try to return the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Best service we experienced on our trip to Pennsylvania. There was a 20-30 min wait for a table or we could sit at the bar. We have a 14 month old so we needed to be seated ASAP, so we opted for the bar. Mai (not sure how she spells her name) was our bartender- best bartender ever. She was amazing. She even ran upstairs to get us tortillas because our daughter couldn't have chips and she was hungry. Also, she makes the BEST margaritas ever! We had the chicken torta sandwich, a salad and it was really yummy. Definitely an amazing place for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"food and service were both excellent. we had a party of three on a busy friday night and i had never been there before. we had cocktails within minutes and chips follwed almost immediately. the server was helpful and quick with refills. the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is that the tacos are really small, so i should have ordered four instead of two. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best if not the best tacos in Pittsburgh.  Very reasonably priced and most of the tacos are gluten free.  An awesome selection of bourbons and tequila.  The bartender makes an excellent manhattan."}
{"text":"My experience here was quite underwhelming. I was here early after work on a weekday and sat at the bar with my friend and ordered the grapefruit margarita. It was ok, a tad too sweet for my taste. As I looked at the menu, I had some questions about vegetarian options and asked the bartender if a certain dish was vegetarian. Our bartender that day was NOT in a good mood. He seemed annoyed that I had a question in the first place. He didn't even look at us and mumbled a response. I couldn't catch what he said, but a bit intimidated by his attitude, didn't ask him to repeat it. We ended up ordering the papas toastadas which tasted good. But by then, I needed my next drink! Uhoh.. time to get our pissed off bartenders attention again! I got the spicy margarita. Normally I love a kick to my drink but what I was served that day was undrinkably hot.. Sweet, but also really really hot. One sip had my lips, mouth and insides on fire. My friend, whose spice tolerance is much higher than mine felt the same way. We asked for water (much to our bartenders annoyance) and waited a whole 10 mins for it! By then the bar had gotten busier and I certainly didn't want to deal with the already grumpy bartenders attitude if I requested an adjustment to my drink. So, as a favor to my digestive tract, I left my entire drink untouched. Oh, we did order their two vegetarian taco options which tasted fine. But if it's tacos and awesome margaritas you're craving, I'd direct you to Täk? or Condado tacos, both of which are in the same area. Better cocktails, better tacos and the added benefit of not having to feel like you're getting on your server's nerves every time you order/have a request."}
{"text":"With a name like \"Bakersfield\", I have to admit I wasn't immediately thinking great taco place.  That said, after going there I can say that this is a great taco place!  It's located right in the middle of Dilworth on East Blvd.  Parking is trouble but they have free valet right across the street.  It's a pretty cool vibe on the inside, looks very modern and hip and all those other buzz words to describe the types of places that yuppies enjoy.    One of the things I really like about this place is that the tacos are a la carte so you can go your own way and mix and match.  My favorites thus far are the pork belly pastor and the fish taco.    Another thing about this place is that they serve the hell out of some whiskey and tequila.  So that's cool.  Apparently Bakersfield has locations in other cities, but it still doesn't feel like a chain-type place so that is a plus.  Good tacos at a reasonable price is always a winner for me."}
{"text":"Alexis was amazing. She knows customer service. She is friendly, attentive, and very... Chill? We tend to be high demanding customers and Alexis delivered quality customer service flawlessly.   Definitely will continue coming back."}
{"text":"The short rib tostada was TO DIE FOR. I'm usually SUCH a picky eater but I didn't ask for anything to be taken off this thing. Everything was so yummy and super fresh and just all around amazing. I've been here a few times and I get the chips and queso to start every time. Tonight was no different. It's so good!!!   June 2017 Update: PUT THE BAJA SHRIMP TACO ON THE MENU! Don't take it away when the special is over. Literally one of the best things I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful tequila & whiskey bar with a western theme & delicious munchies. Indoor and outdoor dining as well! Lunch was wonderful for the whole family. Kids menu with crayons and activities. Servers were quick and attentive. The chips and queso dip made a quick & delicious starter for the group. Plenty of salsa, salsa verde, and hot sauce on the table to go around. I had the Milanesa sandwich and it was everything I could ever dream of. Crispy, but still juicy, chicken on ciabatta with arugula, black beans, and an avocado lemon mayo. It also came with a side of salsa verde which made a great dip for the sandwich, but is just as delicious without. Family enjoyed the tacos as well. Kids liked their fun-sized cheese quesadillas. This was my first time at Bakersfield and has already become a favorite. Park for free in the Public Parking Lot by the West Side Market just a two minute walk to this fun, delicious joint."}
{"text":"Bakersfield tacos were amazing!! My husband and I had dinner and drinks with friends last night.  We tried the short rib, shrimp, and steak tacos.  Best tacos I have had in a really long time! The short rib was my favorite.  We started with the queso and chip appetizer. The queso comes in a tiny cast iron skillet.  It was really good! Everything was very tasty and he tacos had so many different flavors. It is a very busy place so make reservations if you can.  We did not  . We were told it would be an hour wait for a table (which we were okay with).  We ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a table.   For the inconvenience of the wait time the manager did not make us pay for the 2 orders of queso and chips we ordered! Customer service was top notch!! The margaritas are really good too.  Try the pineapple margarita! Price was fair as well.  We will definitely be going back to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Started with their newest queso(the name escapes me but it's on the drink menu). It was delicious.  I got a pollo rojo and a huitlacoche taco and honestly the huitlacoche was the better of the two. Load up on those!  We also had numerous drinks and each was well made. Sat at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. All in all I'd come back often.  Probably ate way too many chips but they were salty heaven."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and eats! Fresh, chunky guacamole is a no-brainer. The mole chicken taco was a personal favorite with pickled onions and smoky sauce. Don't discount the hongos taco either - plenty of hearty mushrooms and cabbage to compete with a meatier taco."}
{"text":"To be honest if this was rated exclusively for service probably deserves one star. The wait staff, all but one was a complete disappointment. The waitress kept taking our orders piecemeal. She would disappear after one person placed their order and then come back significantly later.   One of the waiters brought a drink and as I reached out take it from him he decided to turn around and start talking to his friends and dropped it midway. Thankfully I caught onto it but how is this anywhere close to being professional. We even ordered drinks well ahead of time because they were so tardy and if they were busy they did not communicate it.   We all had tacos and the food is definitely delicious but with the kind of service we had , (party of 6) I wouldn't recommend this place.. I'll prolly give it another go and update.  Update 1: tried it again, have to say the service was such an improvement I would almost give it all five stars.   The salsa was just sad. Sure we got spoiled in Phoenix but the salsa here is so lame I would just say stay away from it all together. The guacamole was way better.   The vegetarian options are limited so let's hope you like the one thing on the menu you can have. That aside they do have good liquor options in tequila and bourbon (I did not see as much in the single malts section)."}
{"text":"Alittle dark and dungeon-like downstairs, but the \"industrial\" atmosphere is overall really good and modern. The drinks are tasty and the service has been spectacular every single time I've been there. The tacos are awesome. We also ordered a pitcher of the pineapple margarita our last visit- also amazing. As always, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was such a cool taco place, the inside was adorable and so cozy. I tried the signature grapefruit margarita and it was my favorite margarita I've ever had. There was a great selection on vegetarian tacos and they were both delicious. I got the chips and salsa with black beans- which sounds weird- but it was amazing. The only thing I didn't enjoy was that they put all the tacos on one board, it was hard to tell which tacos were mine and I couldn't tell which one I was eating."}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield many times. Rock solid tacos, great guac, and the dual salsas are fantastic. Although the drinks are on the spendy side, they are always stiff and perfectly executed.   Keep doing what you're doing Bakersfield, and you've got a customer for life."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Excellent and friendly service. My only complaint was the level of noise coming from the sound system. Would have appreciated some classical guitar or maybe flamenco. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mehhh just ok. Tacos were alright, I wasn't a fan of their tortilla is was kinda gritty tasting and fell apart. Queso with black beans appetizer was delicious. I think this place is over priced, especially their drinks. We sat at the bar and the bartender/server was cool, but kept trying to get us to order shots and it was 2pm on a Wednesday, that got a little annoying. Good place to chill, cool atmosphere but food is just mediocre."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere very great fast service sparkling friendly staff that is very attentive. We stopped in late after a movie great margaritas nice place to stop in for a quick snack or a full dinner"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite taco spot in Pitt. The margs are grand!! Love love love all the tacos but the fish... oh my gosh the fish taco! And the one with the picked cabbage!!!! Take my money take it now!"}
{"text":"A nice little bar/cafe where you can order craft beer and/or tequila and enjoy homemade tacos and guacamole to satisfy your hunger. There are no dinners on the menu even though that is what we went there for but we had no problem making our own dinner by just ordering a bunch of the delicious tacos. We were told that the guacamole is made fresh every 1/2 hour and indeed when we ordered it, it was fresh and good. Also, you can order house pickled jalapenos for only $1. Get these fro sure. Much spicier than the ones in jars. They were great!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed visiting the Pittsburgh location this past Friday night. We went to meet friends for dinner and drinks and ended up getting crammed into a smaller table and when I gave the hostess a look regarding the space she replied, \"just sit anywhere. It doesn't really matter.\" To make matters worse there was clearly no air conditioning on or working at that time. The only ventilation was the front doors being opened. I personally don't enjoy eating dinner while dripping with sweat which is what we all did. I've never eaten that fast before just to get out of there to get fresh cool air. At one point someone came over to FINALLY open the front windows but the damage was already done with the heat.   We have eaten at this establishment in Nashville and loved it, however the Pittsburgh location did not impress. I don't remember much of the food due to trying to stay cool and wipe the sweat from my face.   On top of all of this, there is no contact info on their website to send an email to management."}
{"text":"Looks like someone has finally gotten a solid foothold at this long rotating location AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT!  I've been to Bakersfield an number of times and it has been great every single time. Went on a whim Wednesday night with my fiancee and her sister. It was busy, so we put our name on the list and mingled around. We ended up finding seats at the bar pretty quickly though.  We got an appetizer of chips and guacamole, which was phenomenal. The guac was thick and flavorful and the chips were very.... chippy? I ordered the \"Red Headed Stranger\" to drink, which had a strong but no overpowering Old Forester kick to it. And since Willie Nelson sang \"Red Headed Stranger\", I stuck with the theme and ordered the \"Willie\" from the ensalada menu. It was a \"fiesta salad\" type deal with roasted chicken, bacon, black beans, corns, etc. and a very good buttermilk ranch dressing that I believe they make in-house. Just enough spice to let you know you're still alive.   Only annoyance is that there is close to ZERO parking for Bakersfield, and all the neighboring businesses make that clear. There is limited road parking up to the corner of Kenilworth and East, other than that you can valet or risk parking in the lot of another business."}
{"text":"So after heading to our usual Cabo Fish Taco, which had 20 people outside waiting to get in, I suggested we head across town to Bakersfield. Now that doesn't sound like a drive but we live just outside Mineral Springs! We used the Valet Parking which was great since there is no designated parking.We walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess, who was extremely courteous and definitely knows how to do her job. She took my cel number, so we could get a text when there was a table ready. Off to the bar area where we found two stools. A manager came over and brought us two menus and said a server would be over in case we wanted any drinks or apps. He showed up immediately and we ordered a Corona, Spicy Jalapeño Margarita and Queso with Jalapeños. In a blink of the eye our Queso appeared...steamy hot with lightly salted Tortilla Chips. A few minutes later.. drinks! I ordered my Margarita with no salt but it came rimmed. I called our waiter over and he apologized. I said please tell the bartender not to pour it into another glass but make a fresh one. I watched and the bartender did it without pitching a fit....which lots of bartenders do. We got our text and were taken to our table by both our original and new waiters. She asked and we ordered a PAPAS TOSTADA. This was excellent...there were do many layers of flavors to this.   I had the Fish Taco and my wife had a Pollo Rojo....both were full of flavor and cooked just right. The service was great and the meal well paced. The only issue was our waitress, in addition to our table and the ones around it, had one on the other side of the restaurant. When it came time to get our check she was nowhere in site although her hair is multicolored, but appeared shortly. We'll definitely be back and recommend Bakersfield to everyone. The one funny part of the evening is we realized we were the oldest people there"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve with a great meal, and Bakersfield did not disappoint! The whiskey and tequila selection was impressive, but we started with a pitcher of the Bakersfield Margaritas ($32). Absolutely delicious with limes squeezed fresh for each order. The Chips and Queso appetizer ($6) with chorizo (+ $1) was a nice surprise. It was placed in a cast iron skillet and baked in the oven before serving. I ordered the Short Rib Tostada ($9) as my main course. The short rib was seasoned well and very tender, and anything with a fried egg on top is a winner in my book. My buddy ordered the Short Rib Torta ($10) and almost licked his plate clean. We felt like this was a killer value with a combined total tab, including tax, of only $62. Best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time. There wasn't a drop of margarita or a bite of food left at the end of our meal. The service was attentive, energetic, and incredibly friendly. We could not have asked for a better experience. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"What better way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo than try a new Mexican restaurant that one of my Yelp Friends raves about EVERY TIME I see her! lol *shouts out to Saniqua!!* Ok so I finally made it to Bakersfield and on Cinco de Mayo before the crowds flooded the restaurant.   The parking situation is not as bad as people have warned me about. There is a parking deck in the center of the building Bakersfield is located and it was free for us to park (as far I know, we did not pay lol) and there was several spots available in the deck.   We were quickly seated at a table and started with Tequila. Whiskey. and then Tacos. lol I know this is not the Bakersfield order but my friends and I needed a drink first before anything else. We ordered a pitcher of the margarita which was a great deal compared to buying individual drinks for each of us. The margarita was amazing, not too strong but strong enough to get our Cinco de Mayo started off right! The pitcher was enough for myself and my 2 friends to all get 2 small glasses each.   We ordered the chips and Queso for the table because we are always so indecisive on what to order for entrees. I was not crazy about the queso, it was good but a little too thick in consistency for preference but I constantly ate the chips throughout the meal.   I finally decided on what tacos to order after an extensive search on Yelp and sipping my margarita. The general consensus on Yelp was to go with the chicken taco, the fish taco or the short rib taco. I decided to go with the chicken and the short rib because if you cant get the basics down and perfected, that's a no bueno! lol I was not disappointed in my tacos. They were really good and had a lot of flavor. I think the short rib taco was my favorite and I could've probably ordered a 3rd taco without feeling totally disgusted with myself.  The service was awesome. Our waitress read our minds and split our tickets 3 ways for the margarita pitcher and the queso which is excellent service to me. The restaurant quickly filled up by the time we finished our meal and seems like a great hang out spot on the weekends or evenings. The bar was packed. So thanks to Saniqua, I am a fan of Bakersfield and will be back for a pitcher of margaritas."}
{"text":"Heads up, this is not your regular Mexican restaurant! We went in with hopes of eating up to the neck but our hopes were down the moment we saw the menu. It's more of an Americanized version. You got beers and a variety of drinks and cocktails. The menu is offers a limited choice of Mexican food which are pretty light. If you go in really hungry like us, you might want to plan on getting two orders. The chips don't come free. But the food is fresh though not plentiful. The ambience and crowd are good and you could keep drinking till 2am, and that's when they close. Would I recommend it, yes if you are drinking and no if you go in with hopes of filling your tummy."}
{"text":"As a newer addition to the ever-growing Pittsburgh trendy restaurant scene, Bakersfield did not disappoint. It is an odd but cool combo of a tequila and Whiskey bar, which is actually an amazing southwest American mashup. The prices are well worth it for the food and service you receive. We stopped in on Cinco de Mayo and enjoyed a Margarita pitcher (64-oz of margarita worth) for 32 bucks. That's an amazing deal and they were perfect! No artificial sour mix here. The guacamole and salsas were some of the best I've had. The chipotle salsa has a kick and I actually started eating it with a fork because it was so good. On top of that, the tacos are unique and well priced for the quality. They are served a la carte so you can mix and match.  The best part of the night was our server CJ. He provided good conversation and amazingly attentive service. Thanks for the great evening!"}
{"text":"NO MORE BISTEC = DEALBREAKER!!  Bakersfield used to be my favorite taco place. They discontinued the Bistec (sweet and delicious steak) and Pollo Rojo (chicken with red sauce) tacos. How do you NOT have any beef on your menu???   I stayed loyal even when your AC was broken, when you teased me with your corn queso and chili AND the loss of the adjacent parking structure. I can't get past this one B. The love affair is over and I'm not sure I'll be back. Sorry Bakersfield - it was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"I come here frequently with coworkers, it's around the corner from our office. The specialty drinks here are great and the chips, salsas, and queso always hit the spot. Had a pineapple margarita that was the bomb last time I was there. It's a nice place to drink after work. However, the hostesses are rarely friendly and while the servers are typically very nice, almost every time we go there's something wrong with someone's food or drink order, sometimes whole orders being forgotten. I can only think of one occasion where this hasn't occurred and I've probably been here 8 times in the last year."}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 stars, but Bakersfield was deserving of that and more. Came for lunch on a Friday and there was nothing negative about my experience...food, prices, quantities, service and ambiance were all great. We split the queso and got it with the jalapeños...it was hot, cheesy, and looked as amazing as it tasted. I also got fish tacos and pork tacos and they were delicious...everything was so fresh and flavorful. Service was friendly and constantly checking in to make sure everything was okay, and gave us two of their salsas to try which both enhanced the meal as well. They were super kind about splitting the check, which we normally try to avoid when possible but they offered it to us. I'm graduating college at Pitt in a few weeks and wish I had discovered this place earlier because this immediately became one of the restaurants I will miss the most."}
{"text":"Our first time at Bakersfield was okay, but it had just opened. We come here a lot now because this place has the best queso and phenomenal tacos.  I always get the Pollo Rojo because it is to die for. I have actually battled the parking for some takeout one time just for those flavorful tacos. The chicken Milanese is huge and is also extremely good.  Weird as it sounds, this place has some of the best/ strongest mimosas and bloody Mary's, which are not put juice, but instead a nice mix of seasonings and liquor.  The only downside is the parking. There are a ton of signs in the parking garage and nearby that say \"No parking for Bakersfield customers.\" My guess is that the other businesses are just jealous! You are better off taking an Uber there."}
{"text":"My first visit brought a most unexpected surprise. I asked the server for coffee. He said they did not have any hot beverages. So I joined the other guests at a family party. Another server, Tyler, surprised me with a Starbucks coffee. He went down the street in the rain to get it. This was outstanding service! Unexpected and wonderful. I've eaten around the world and never had such kindness. Thank you Tyler. Yes, the food was imaginative and enjoyable. One negative...the noise was extreme. Not a place for for involved conversation."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends.  We shared a pitcher of spicy margaritas (a little spicy and refreshing, but delicious), tacos, chips and salsa, and a toastada.  Tacos are definitely smaller, but delicious.  Especially the fish taco and pollo rojo.  Salsa was really awesome as well.  I tried the toastada, which was almost like a burrito bowl, not huge, but definitely larger than the tacos.  It was really tasty.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and amazing decor. The place is quite upscale for the feel of it.  The tacos are ok but the salads are amazing and the toppings are top notch, can surely improve upon tacos because you can eat great tacos at TAKO down the street.  The drink specials are amazing and they have great options for mezcal !!"}
{"text":"the food is excellent and extremely fresh. they have amazing option on the menu and even better margaritas. What made our dinner so great was our server Kurt!! he was very easy going and made our meal very enjoyable"}
{"text":"Another great taco joint in Pittsburgh. Bakersfield offers several choices of tacos. Everything from; beef, chicken, veggies and fish. Unlike so many other taco places they actually have a wide variety of tacos to choose from.  Downside: the tacos are pretty small so you will have to order at least 3 or more to fill you up.  The chips and salsa is really good too. The salsa is fresh and has lots of flavor and a tad bit of spiciness. And the chips come out slightly warm so you can tell they are also fresh.  Another plus is they are open till 2am every night. So if you are needing somewhere to eat late at night and want better quality food then \"bar\" food Bakersfield is the place to go."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and everything each time has been great. The bartenders do a nice job keeping up. Was there last night, a Friday, and we got there just before the rush--about 615. They do a great job making fresh margaritas and definitely recommend a pitcher if we a groups of 3-4. They have a nice tequila selection (would love it even more if you would stock Ocho Tequila) and appear to have a good bourbon selection.  The guacamole is really good along with the sauces. I have now tried all of the tacos--favs are the braised beef and the mole tacos. The others are great too--full of flavor!  Typically very fast but I think they lost our order last night as it took a while and the manager came to apologize. Not a big deal as they were slammed.  Not sure if they have improved the parking situation or not, we parked at the Teeter. Valet was full when we walked by."}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say I can give this place 5 stars! The food is excellent! Can't go wrong with the beverage selection. The inside is very clean. Decor is awesome! Service is good.   The only bad thing I can say about this restaurant is the parking. It's street parking.. which could put you down the street, around the corner and down the block."}
{"text":"Our first time in Pittsburgh and we found our place! Tequila and Tacos is their specialty and it's amazing!  Jesse the Bartender made the best margaritas and was phenomenal. Pittsburgh is awesome and this place truly adds to the experience... try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Tacos were great. Queso was good, but not your standard queso.  Different, but not in a bad way.  You just gotta try it.  I get that it's a Western themed place, but I could've used NFL Network or Sportscenter on the TVs as I was there the day after the beatdown of the Ravens, which is why I was in Pittsburgh on Christmas! Only thing I had to look at was the bartender who prepping for his service, LOL.  I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Tortillas are house made, guacamole is chunky but smooth, and the tacos are PACKED with layers of flavor! I love that they give you lime wedges on the side to spritz over any & all of your food for yet another layer of flavor. The tacos are a bit small (probably due to the authenticity of the tortilla), so I would recommend 2-3 depending on how hungry you are. I had 2 and split an appetizer of guacamole & chips- it was the perfect amount of food! If your contemplating giving this place a try- I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had an issue with our food and the owner, Brian, who was also helping at our table, comp'ed the whole meal. Really nice.   The place has a great atmosphere and excellent service. We also love the chips and that green salsa."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, friendly staff. The sweet tea isn't overly sweet. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Tacos are very good. Place is always packed.  The only stupid thing being they appear to charge you a dollar for hot sauce. Never heard of such a thing before."}
{"text":"The short rib taco is a must!!   Tasty tacos, good drinks, sweet western movies playing in the background.  They don't take reservations, but if it's crowded it is in a good spot where you can walk around town! Reasonably priced! Friendly staff!   We went on a Friday night and waited about 30 minutes for a table. From sitting down to paying our check, we were probably only in there for about 45 minutes. Great service and we were given some good recommendations!"}
{"text":"Whole lotta no.   Cool place, barely acceptable food. Perhaps if we'd had several whiskey drinks we would have been impressed. We'd gone in search of tacos and had read Bakersfield was among the best. We vehemently disagree. No to the queso, which was thick in a bad way & seasoned strangely; no to the tacos; even no to the sweet tea that tasted off and was returned. Returning is something we won't be."}
{"text":"The food here is always great! The tacos and margaritas are amazing and with a big group the selecciones are perfect. Tyler is easily one of the best waiters I've ever had anywhere, he handled our friend's birthday dinner so well and was very attentive throughout the night."}
{"text":"Danielle is the best bartender in town. Super accommodating, remembers you, and treats you with the upmost kindness. She will treat you right! She' also beautiful"}
{"text":"So. Much. Potential. With a long history in the food service industry, I am always sure to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but Bakersfield has swung very hard, come very close, and missed.   I've had a taco before, believe it or not, and this particular taco was certainly above average. The problem here lies with the atmosphere and service. My party placed their orders... Actually... Screamed their orders over the music (which was cranked to 11). When the food finally arrived, it was presented on one large tray and left to us to decipher what was what and whose was whose.   I didn't mind the food, but the margarita was pretty weak, and the overall experience lacked polish and enthusiasm.  I wish I could say I'll be back, as the restaurant's concept and mission are something I look for in a dining experience. However, the overall experience was a huge letdown... My future Mexican outings will be to Paco's Tacos."}
{"text":"Cool-looking place.  Awesome food.  Good service.    This is definitely one of the more unique restaurants down in the area.  We got 12 or so tacos as a team -- personally, I got the braised short rib and the pork belly.  They were both delicious, but all of them looked really good.  This was the first lunch spot I went to with my work squad over the summer, and we probably proposed it at least once a week from then on for lunch -- ultimately, there were just so many other places we wanted to try!  I'd go again if I were near East Blvd more often."}
{"text":"It's just as good as Tako. The prices are very reasonable. The margaritas are served in a mason jar. I like that. The guacamole is very fresh and has nice chunks of avocado. The server puts two sauce bottles on the table, house made, one is a cilantro sauce and one is a smokey sauce. These sauces rock, I want to drink them. We had tacos and a salad. I was a little disappointed that my salad had home fries in it, I was trying to be a bit on the healthy side, but it was good. I don't know about that fry thing on a salad Pittsburgh, I am from Maine and I want my salad to be a bit on the fresh from the garden side. Love this place. Love Pittsburgh. Love my husband."}
{"text":"The food was good here but the service gets worse and worse every time I go. My waiter took ten minutes to even come to our table, then he forgot our utensils and napkins.I also used no wait and still had to wait another 30 minutes. Will not return for awhile."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some tasty tacos in Ohio City. Huge outdoor patio is great for summertime.  Attentive servers make for an enjoyable experience. Be sure to request Adam!"}
{"text":"One word...ole!  Many say Mexican food is spicy or it's like Taco Bell...but Bakersfield made that a myth! I had three different tacos and that was one of the few times when America made quality Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and cheap! I have had pretty much everything! Try a torta if you are starving, I didn't think to ever get one and just did and loved it. All the dips and tacos are great. My favorites are the short rib and the fish but the salads are all good too."}
{"text":"Such an incredible bar/ restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh! They only take reservations for larger parties but my Mom and I had no issue getting a table (maybe a 5 min wait) at 6pm on a Thursday night. There were definitely people there so it was a fun and upbeat vibe. The tacos only come with one so we ended up ordering two of each so we could each try one and got multiple things (tapas style). The pineapple margarita I had is the sweetest on the menu and I LOVED IT! Their queso dip is really good as well and extremely popular. The bartenders and our server were very personable and got our food and drinks out very quick. I will definitely be back next time I'm Downtown!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was originally seated at a communal table downstairs, but opted to sit at the bar. We started with chips and guacamole, the guacamole was quite good. Really fresh and a good balance of ingredients, not overwhelming in any one area. I would definitely recommend it. I got three tacos, pollo rojo, bistec, and short rib. The bistec was ok, the meat was very sweet which is generally not my thing, but if you like that then it's worth a try. The pollo rojo was good, the chicken wasn't dry and was pretty flavorful. However, the true must try is the short rib. The meat was flavorful, soft, and very juicy. The tortillas were fresh and very good. The tacos in general were sort of small, depending on how hungry you are, definitely get three!! They are completely filled to the brim though, and al the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Overall, would definitely go again with a better idea of what is worth it to eat. It's $4 for a taco, which is to be expected for a more upscale taco place."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place - won't be back though. We visited at 5p on a Saturday and were seated right away.   First off, if you're going to charge for chips and salsa, you're making a really bad impression - unless it's the best salsa ever.  This isn't. You get a red and a green. The red tastes like cooked tomato paste with barbecue sauce. The green is a little better but basically tastes like runny guac. There's no fresh taste in either salsa like you'll find at authentic Mexican places.   Next was the queso. There are few things I love as much as queso and even the not-so-good ones are still pretty good. This was the biggest disappointment of the meal and THE WORST QUESO EVER!!!!!!  I don't know what was going on - it looked great in a little cast iron skillet with bubbly golden cheese on top. Unfortunately, that bubbly golden top was hard and impossible to scoop through. We had to break it up with a spoon (!). It gets worse. Under that cheese was some thick, your chip gets stuck and breaks off, pasty substance that I can only compare to hummus - if you baked it dry or something. Unacceptable and just so, so bad.   The hongos and bistec tacos were good. The papas tostada was okay. The pollo rojo tasted like fish for some reason and wasn't eaten after the first bite.   The drinks were excellent though. (Still doesn't make up for that queso though!) We had a premium margarita and la Paloma. Fresh and delicious! If I wasn't honest, could've gotten one of those drinks free as our semi-stressed server forgot to put it on the bill and had to be reminded.   Everyone who works there is friendly and energetic. There's a decent feel to the place and a good selection of music.   So don't go out of your way but if you're in the area, maybe stop in for a drink. But eat somewhere else. And don't get the queso!"}
{"text":"I was looking for date night spots on yelp and this place looked promising. They have their own parking lot which is a plus but I wasn't impressed with the overall experience. The food and drinks were just average and I think the reason why people define this place as a date night spot is because of cramped space, dim lighting and loud music. None of them is a criteria for my date night spot and  that's part of the reason why I was disappointed. Top it all, food was expensive ($4/taco). Nothing this place offers puts a big smile on my face and thus 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great drinks and atmosphere, didn't like how chunky the guacamole was but that's just a personal preference. Great place to get the night started or go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge taco fan. Huge. So I was anxious to get here and order me some tacos on a warm Saturday afternoon. First impression is that this feels distinctly like a hipster place. Maybe it's because I'm old but that's just the vibe I picked up. Oh, and the fact that your PBR is served in a glass boot. That, to me, screams hipster. Look, I'm not gonna judge, although my good taste says I'm entitled to do just that, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a single thing I would drink out of a glass cowboy boot. Certainly not PBR. Would never drink that. Enough said about that.   The bar is great. The shot of the day is a great feature and the margaritas looked good. The whiskey/bourbon menu was impressive as well. I went with beer cause I was gonna be drinking later. Hey, it was a Saturday afternoon! Attentive bartender was a plus.   The food? Here's where I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. The guacamole is as good as everyone says. Really good with just the right amount of cilantro and lime with chunks of fresh avocado. I'd order this every time. The tacos? I've had better in quite a few places around town. Granted they are not skimpy and their presentation is nice. We ordered four different ones and I'd say that 2 were really good and the other 2 just ok. The good? The cochinita pibil and the short rib. The others were the pork belly pastor and the pollo rojo. Just wasn't enough flavor there. Plus the tacos are served on a single tortilla and the juiciness causes the tacos to fall apart. Could be messy.   Would I come back? Absolutely. That's why I'm rounding up to 4 stars. But I'm coming for the guacamole and to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to go to Bakersfield on cinco de mayo, when we got there the host said the wait for a table was over two hours but there was standing tables downstairs so we put our names in and decided to give the downstairs a try, we were quickly greeted by a server named Chris who gave us a run down of the specials they had for the night, he also suggested the new pineapple margarita, which sounded so good we couldn't help but to order a round. We ended up going upstairs and had wonderful service from a woman named Brittany. Didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for my food. The entire experience was phenomenal, from the hostess to our table service. I will absolutely recommend Bakersfield to anyone for some greatly priced food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Great tacos, tequila and service. We had the an amazing server - Ace (shout out) - who was fun, helpful and awesome. Thanks for the best night guys."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in downtown Pittsburgh. The tacos are great and I would say two tacos are enough per person if you split chips and queso or salsa. Unfortunately they aren't so big on drink specials or happy hour deals but their jalapeno margaritas are hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Late lunch in Cleveland. The food had lots of great flavors, got a fish taco and a pollo rojo taco and some chips and guac, all delicious. They had lots of great drink specials though I had to skip out on them due to work. Seems like a great lunch or drinks & bites spot."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is by far my favorite taco spot in Pittsburgh. Their tacos are AMAZING. I have never had a bad taco here. The customer service is excellent and it has a great atmosphere. The tacos are pretty small so I would definitely order a couple. I usually order 4 and walk out pretty full. The shrimp and steak are definitely my favorite! I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for delicious tacos and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hate to give three stars for great food, but what's good food without good service? I sat at the bar by myself, which I guess screams to some people, \"low tab, low tip!\"   I sat at the bar for in uncomfortably long time as everyone else around me was helped before someone finally took my order. The food came out relatively fast and it was delicious. I got chips and queso (the queso was AWESOME), a Baja shrimp taco, and a beef taco. Everything was good, but once again no one checked on me for quite some time.   I will say, the people behind the bar were extremely kind and friendly. Maybe they just need extra help."}
{"text":"The food and margaritas were awesome! It is a very open, hip feel. We sat next to the patio and our service was great! After asking if we had visited before and finding out we have not she went over how they use fresh, local ingredients and make their corn tortillas in house. There was three of us and we got a pitcher of margaritas, chips and gauc, and 8 tacos. Everything tasted delicious. The tacos are authentic and smaller than a normal tortilla, 3 would be good to order. Only thing was that it is a tad pricey and can increase quickly. Overall would return!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Great drinks! Great prices!  I recently went to this place on a Friday night. There was a 45 minute wait when we got there so we bar hopped on Penn until we were called. The staff was great! Very friendly!  Order the short rib! It was my favorite! The chicken tacos are both delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield a few times now and my experiences have been so-so. The tacos are generally pretty good, but they are on the smaller side.   My main issue, though, is the service. On my last visit, it took between 30-45 minutes to get our drinks after ordering them. Our server was barely around. Dinner took about two hours because they rarely came by. Our tacos came out on one tray for the table, but the person who brought them was unsure of which tacos were which. Made for an interesting eating experience."}
{"text":"I'm starting to wonder if anyone in Cleveland has ever actually had a good taco. I can't figure out any other reason why all of these taco places I'm trying out have 4-5 stars and sell these slapdash circles of cold garbage that are barely worth half a star. Why is everything in Cleveland in upside-down Bizarre-o World, huh? Is it possible that nobody but Midwestern tourists are reviewing the restaurants and breweries and businesses that pop up overnight, and since they're from towns where there's nothing but a Dairy Queen attached to a gas station and a Taco Bell Pizza Hut, they think it's A-plus #1 dining anytime they see a word on a menu they don't recognize? I don't know. That's probably it. I hope Bakersfield isn't *actually* deemed acceptable food by my fellow residents of this city.  Everything looks pretty good at this place. The combinations of ingredients on their tacos sound good, and as our waitress confirmed, corn tortillas are handmade in house. Sounds great! We ordered a few tacos, some queso dip, and I ordered a house margarita. The menu made a big deal about this margarita, all the \"artisanal\" keywords were there: hand squeezed, fresh lemon and lime, blah blah blah. What I got was a gunky Mason jar filled with a neon ooze that I'm pretty sure would turn a normal turtle into a Ninja Turtle. I'm not saying it was made with the $4.99 bottle of Jose Cuervo mix, but--wait, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. No good.   Queso dip arrived looking fabulous: beautiful lightly-toasted white cheese in a skillet tempted us. Then we dug in with our chips and the entire top layer of real cheese came away to reveal a gritty, cheese-flavored paste beneath. It was definitely some kind of take on Queso Blanco, but the ratio of flour to cheese was 50 parts flour, 1 part cheese-flavored powder. Clumpy, dumpy, and gross.  Tacos were similarly disappointing. No matter what you order for your filling (we tried 4 different tacos), it's all the same bland, stringy, flavorless mess. Fresh ingredients as toppings tasted fine, but the bases of the tacos were all prepared as if the cook was deathly afraid of using spices. Finally, the handmade corn tortillas were served ice cold, straight from the fridge, loaded down with warm filling, so when you picked them up and folded them around the filling to take a bite, the whole thing crackled and fell apart in a bunch of dry little bits. Would it kill you to heat up these tortillas you've spent the time to make by hand? I don't think it would.  Overall, Bakersfield would have some serious competition if a Chipotle with a patio opened up next door. Or if people realized you can just buy crappy tortillas and cheap margarita mix at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Good food and cool atmosphere. FYI - it gets rather loud in here and parking can suck (no designated lot but valet does exist)."}
{"text":"The tacos and the drinks were wonderful. The guacamole was pretty good, too, though it's a good thing we had a spoon to mix it up more - it started out more like large pieces of avocado with seasoning... The tacos we got were all delicious and I look forward to going back to try more. Almost everything on the menu looked great and everything we had was delicious. The margaritas are pricey, but really good and it's hard to find someone who will make a good pineapple margarita, which I love. The food prices were a lot more reasonable than I expected for the quality. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't been there yet!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! The house margarita, the a la cart tacos, the chips and salsa. The queso was unique and among my favorites. Loved the fish taco and the Hawaiian too. Hipster, casual atmosphere, will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Ohio City. There was a HUGE event going on that made the place standing-room only. Yet the service from the Kitchen to the Wait staff was not slow. It was still great service with the servers helping each other out with the packed house. Try the pineapple margarita."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a lively and popular place to grab a bite to eat before or after a concert or other downtown Pittsburgh attraction. Our party of four shared a variety of small tacos -- all of them tasty and distinct from more plebeian Mexican fare. They have a wide range of beers and whiskies as well. The main issue may be that this place is very popular and can get crowded and require a wait. I see from the website that this is a chain but it didn't have a \"chain\" feel but rather like a Pittsburgh eating institution. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great Got the grapefruit soda and Guac and chips even though I didn't eat any Everyone seems pleased with the guac though  This place has a nice atmosphere and rich mahogany picnic tables.  You will be pleasantly perplexed with the sensation of being outdoors with the comfort of an indoor temperature and humidity.  They don't have mustard but two bottles of sauce.  One is red and one is green.  Not sure what they are but I can only help but assume they are salsa."}
{"text":"I am torn on between 3 and 4 stars for Bakersfield.  The hype behind here has been huge, but this just wasn't the most memorable Mexican.  The service was good, but I just am not as passionate as others about here.  I first tried to come here during a Gallery Crawl and was quoted a three hour wait.  This was perfect, as my friends and I were going to hang out at the Crawl for a few hours and then eat.  Sadly, the line moved slower than expected so we moved on to somewhere else.  However, I came back last week and did get to try it out.  It was my understanding that Bakersfield doesn't take reservations, but I came here for lunch with twelve people and it seems like we must have had one.  I was late so I am not sure.  However, our group fit nicely at one of the communal tables.  Our group used the Seleciones de la casa, which was $15/person for unlimited chips and salsa, chips and queso, chips and gauc, and tacos.  You can only do this for groups of 6-14 people, but it kept the cost down.  This is a great options for big groups and makes the price really reasonable per person.  The actual food was what did not excite me.  I could not stomach the salsa, nor could the four people sitting with me.  The red salsa tastes like a mix of BBQ sauce and tomato sauce, and it was not appetizing.  The queso looked really amazing, and it was very thick and creamy.  It was also very American, however, and didn't resemble anything authentic.  It was a bit more like cheese fondue, and while it was good, there was no hot sauce or anything to give it a kick.  The homemade guac is apparently made every hour, and it was exceptional.  The chips that came with all of these dips were served warm and not salted, which is my favorite.  The tacos are normally $4/taco.  I ordered the short rib and fish tacos.  These tacos are not very big so I would recommend three for lunch and four or five for dinner if that is all you are eating.  The short rib was OK, although the meat was not particularly tender.  I enjoyed the fish much more, although they do use a fish stick for this taco.  I think I would pass on the short rib and just order fish tacos next time.  The standout point of Bakersfield is the service.  Our server was so nice and friendly, and we had an awfully high maintenance group.  The hostesses were lovely on my unsuccessful trip and successful one as well.  I may not love the food here, but don't let that deter you.  Other people seem to enjoy it, and the service is spectacular even if you don't love the food either."}
{"text":"One of my top 2 taco spots in Cleveland, the food is priced reasonably and the flavor of the tacos is awesome. Typically I prefer flour tortillas but their corn tortillas are spot-on. Cocktails & craft beer are a bit expensive, but they offer several domestic cans/bottles that are reasonable and a \"shot of the day\" which is $3 I think. It's a fun & vibrant space that's usually somewhat busy but we've always been able to get a table right away."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I've been here twice in the last month.  The food is very reasonably price, the drinks are pricy though.  They have several amazing veggie options for the non meat eaters in your life!! The staff is great too!  This review is short sweet and to the point because everything we have had is mind blowing!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Bakersfield based on yelp! Reviews when I needed a quick lunch. I was able to walk to the restaurant from the convention center and was quickly seated at the bar. The environment of the restaurant is trendy/hipster with lots of wood, exposed brick and iron embellishments. I was somewhat surprised that this was a taco/modern Mexican joint since nothing about the name, atmosphere or staff seemed to reflect the food.  We ordered the chips and queso and I got the Willie salad. The chips were crisp and salty, just like I like them. The queso was not spicy and lacked flavor, but if you are looking to fill your cheese fix, this will do it. My salad was really incredible and huge--I wasnt able to finish it after filling up on the chips so I was sad to leave it behind. There was a good emphasis on fresh ingredients, which I always appreciate.  The only reason I was not able to give Bakersfield a full 5 stars was the service. We sat at the bar, right in front of the draft beer, in hopes of quick and efficient service since we were on a time crunch. This was a Saturday afternoon and the bar was moderately busy. The bar tender must was been new because he wasn't familiar with the menu or ingredients. But he was also pretty slow and lacked attention. My water glass sat empty and in clear view most of my meal and until I waved someone down and asked for a refill. I'm sure this could be a fluke, but it certainly impacted my experience."}
{"text":"I tried this place after hearing from someone that they have authentic Mexican tacos. Being that I love Mexican food I knew I had to try this place. I had the Rajas Taco which was delicious along with the Papas tostadas. The corn tortillas are delicious and are made in house and the taco was great. My favorite though was the Papas tostadas it was so delightful to my taste buds to keep my food vegan I just ask them to remove the creamy cilantro sauce and cheese and topped my food with there red salsa sauce that was amazing! The only downside is the parking but other than that this is a cool spot!"}
{"text":"A year later and still a five star experience at Bakersfield for me!  Their queso, along with the additions of chorizo and pickled jalapenos, gets my vote for best queso (and chips) in Charlotte. That statement is backed up by my mom who constantly craves Bakersfield's queso. Their chips are gloriously lightly salted, crispy delights.  The margaritas are just so good that I have to truly pace myself when drinking one....or a couple. I always say the next time I visit I'm going to try the spicy margarita but the classic wins me over every time.   The staff is tops. I went to Bakersfield on my 30th birthday (because 30 calls for margs and tacos, duh) and they brought me out a complimentary shot as well as filled my own specialized birthday cup with their margarita goodness.   Parking is still a nightmare so either Uber or utilize the free valet service across the street at Berrybrook."}
{"text":"Picture it: A cold Sunday afternoon, lunch with a foodie Manhattanie friend I haven't seen in ages; we want a restaurant, we want it to be good, we want it to be close to his hotel because it's 15 degrees out, and we want it to be open, because it's Sunday and we're downtown. Yelp told me the whole block was good, so I was open to whatever worked out. But let's face it. I was born in San Diego and I'm always chasing tacos, so I wasn't disappointed when this was the first place whose doors were unlocked.  We were seated promptly and the host was knowledgeable but not overbearing about drink possibilities. In the end we went with fresh-squeezed lemonade because we weren't in an alcoholic mood, and that was a good call even in the middle of winter. Who does not want fresh-squeezed lemonade? Why don't I freshly squeeze my lemons? (I'm lazy, that's why, but I may have to be less lazy because it was really delicious.)  We started with guac, chips, and queso. Friends, the queso comes with that lovely crust on it, you know what I'm talking about, like the cheese that hits the pan when you're making grilled cheese and it's the best. There's a reason they serve it with a spoon. The guacamole is fresh and chunky. None of that smoothly processed nonsense.  We also got a variety of tacos, on homemade tortillas. There's another thing I wish I wasn't too lazy to make. Tortillas are not just a taco delivery device, friends. They are for tastiness. My designated tacos were the chicken mole and the hongos (mushrooms). Not too spicy, but that chicken, wow, so delicious. Presentation was delightful and the filling-to-tortilla ratio is such that you may lose a bite (or lend a bite to your dining companion before eating the taco, this is a better plan, just sayin) but overall you're getting a decent amount of innards without being left eating several bites of tasty tortilla.  The service was good, timely (except you should obviously expect your FRESH squeezed lemonade to take a bit of time because they are squeezing lemons and that takes a hot minute), attentive but not up your nose. Note that we were in there on a Sunday during a football game so it was only about 1/3-1/2 full, which is my preferred fullness of restaurant. Put this on my \"A+ would taco again\" list."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Bakersfield in Columbus Ohio, so was excited to try here in Charlotte. Take out was quick, especially during dinnertime. Got the guac and the chicken chorizo tostada. Both were very heavy handed with the spice(jalapeño). Unable to eat:( Different from my previous experience with this chain, probably sticking with Sabor in the future."}
{"text":"We came for Mother's Day and it was fantastic! We shared 3 appetizers, one was the house  made guacamole and it was delicious!! The staff was super friendly and attentive throughout the entire meal. The decor really fits in with the area and is welcoming and warm.  We each had a different entree and all were great! The braised short rib sandwich is huge and enough for 2 people! The tostada were also very good as well as the tacos. There is something for everyone and each item on the menu has a little twist so as not to be like anything else you may have had before! Definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes a little their food choices to. E a little \"out of the norm\"!!! We will be back especially once it gets warmer and the garage doors can be opened for an enhanced dining experience!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Bakersfield on IG and decided to have a family date night with my sibs, boyfriend and cousin. To start we got the queso with chorizo on top and it was delish! Warm, delish and they slightly brown it on top which I liked. For our first round of drinks we got a pitcher of the seasonal margarita which was pineapple. It was a wonderful balance of sweet pineapple flavor and tequila. Loved that the drink was strong but wasn't super sweet. It had just enough flavor to mask the tequila and give that refreshing pineapple/tropical taste. Because there were 5 of us and frankly also because we enjoy margaritas, we got two more pitchers - the original margarita and the sangria. The pineapple was still my favorite! They also had $5 tequila shot specials so as expected we ordered a couple rounds of those as well.   Tacos were great! I'm used to Barrio portion sizes so I ordered two tacos but ended up getting one more because they're on the smaller side. I got the Bistec, Cochinita Pibil and Pollo Rojo. I eyed the menu prior to coming and had my heart set on the Short Rib taco but they were out so I guess I just have to go back. Oh the torture haha. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their tacos as well and had no complaints.   Okay so now the most important aspect of a dining experience in my opinion - the service. Service was excellent. We went later on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded. They cleaned off a table for us right away but a couple of us wanted a booth instead and they were more than willing to accommodate us. Our server Scott was wonderful. He was very attentive and he joked with us throughout the night. Loved the vibe and décor. My boyfriend is really into the more rustic look so he loved the pipe door handles and overall décor of the place. I thought it was pretty cool too.   Overall great experience and we will be back. Hope you'll save me some of the short rib tacos!"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! My margarita was made a little too strong for my liking and I mentioned it to the server and the management came out and said it was removed from my ticket! Very understanding and a fun environment with GREAT food!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time for a date night, and thought it was good but not great. We might come back again. We thought it was a bit overpriced for the size/amount of food you get, but the food itself was pretty tasty. Good combination of ingredients used in the tacos. Parking is pretty scarce here, so valet is the way to go."}
{"text":"Always have a good experience here.  The Willie salad is my favorite and they probably make my favorite tacos (and guacamole) in Charlotte. Love the fish, pollo roja and cochinita pibil tacos.  The wait is an issue on weekend nights so come early or be prepared to wait - the bar is pretty spacious."}
{"text":"The meal was absolutely amazing!!! We are from NYC and we were not expecting such a great meal. Dani was such a great waitress. She recommended the apple cider margarita and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.  This will be our first stop the next time we are in Pittsburgh!!!!"}
{"text":"Not that good...the service was excellent and very friendly but the food was soggy. The queso was very good but the taco shells were extremely bland. If you're looking for drinks go here but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"Listen, imma gonna give it to you straight. I just walked out of Bakersfield looking like a happy, sweaty, pregnant walrus and I have no regrets. Stuffed AF ya'll.  Disclaimer: I've had two of their alcoholic beverages and they are deceptively strong. Like \"Ooohh yeah this pineapple margarita ($10) is amazing! I can't even taste the liquor! Bring me one of those pretty sangria's! ($9)\" And the next thing you know you're being feisty and harassing the wait staff again. Whatevs, they liked it. At least that's what my lawyer is going to argue...  Sorry, I got off track, let me start at the beginning. We had our monthly supper club here tonight. I was not allowed to reserve a table so a couple of us showed up early to snag seating for 15. (Apparently there were 3 others in our group but we got separated in the crowded room. I think they might have been the three ballerina's at one of the standing tables. If that was you I'm so sorry! I didn't check my messages until it was all over! I have failed as a host.)  Anyways, we were served by Matt (aka Chewy) and Brandon. Both did an excellent job with our big group. Pleasant and attentive. We also had the manager Joe (aka Haley Joel Osment) wandering about us like a homeless person ready to pounce at any taco left behind. Just kidding, he was nice and just making sure everything was going okay. (It was his first day). Oh and this reminds me, Joe and Mr. General Manager Neil are some tasty looking eye candy. Meow, come here and sit on this spinster cat lady's lap!   Alright, now that I'm banned from Bakersfield, let me wrap up this review. I think most of us partook in the make your mama holler special (I just made that name up) where groups of 6 or more are allowed to get shareable appetizers (chips, chunky guac, salsa, cheese dip), the most delicious salad, and a variety of tacos for just $15 each! And it was served endless style, like they loaded us up! \"Oh you need more tacos? No problem! Let me get you taken care of, sexy lady\". Okay, they didn't really say sexy lady, but I'm 31 years old currently sitting in the shower, alone, while I write this so I'm gonna dream damn it!  I'd say the food and drinks were pretty tasty. Drinks are a bit pricey, but they made me happy so I'm gonna make it rain (as in, take all my money for those not up on the cool kid slang). Service was awesome, decor was western industrial?, definitely had a trendy but laid-back vibe to it. My only complaint would be that it did not appear their A/C was working. This was bad because it was 70° out and raining and they had the windows and doors open so it was super humid and warm inside. Like I'm an extra juicy babe, ya'll can't be subjecting me to those conditions unless you want to personally wipe the sweat off my body.   Okay, I'm probably gonna regret this review in the morning, but YOLO. Actually I already regret that stupid saying. I'm done. Time to watch Golden Girls.     **Update: Upon some reflection I had to dock a star for the whole hot and sweaty situation. Several members of our group complained about it and I know I felt really gross and immediately hopped in the shower when I got home. You should be using the A/C on hot and rainy days, don't be leaving those doors open and letting the humidity in, especially with it being crowded inside. If there is an issue with the A/C get it fixed ASAP cause summer is a comin'! They just opened two weeks ago so hopefully this was just a fluke. But you should definitely still check them out! Just maybe wear thin breathable fabric and have a towel to dab your face/body with."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first experience at Bakersfield on Friday 7/21, my 40th birthday. I love Mexican food and was trying to decide which restaurant I wanted to have lunch at. After reading all of the great reviews for this place we decided to try it ourselves. Was not disappointed. The place lives up to it's previous 4-5 star reviews. The service was excellent. Haley took great care of us!!! The food was fabulous. My husband had two tacos, a short rib and a chicken (per Haley's recommendation). I had the short rib tostada. We split the Loretta salad. We were given 2 salsas to use with our meal. The roasted tomato salsa was still warm from the prep process. We practically licked our plates at the end of the meal. Will definitely go back sometime soon. Looking forward to our multiple, future dining experiences at this fab place in Ohio City!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere in here. Love the veggie taco options. Also enjoyed the tostada salad. Super tasty food options here."}
{"text":"Their chips and queso with chorizo are the best I have ever had! Their Bakersfield Margarita is also one of the best margaritas I've ever had. The atmosphere of the upstairs and downstairs bar are very cool and unique. They play old western movies on the TVs too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with my wife. The place was nicely laid out with comfortable seating and decently spaced tables, the walls didn't seem too echo-y so it'd probably be comfortable even when it's fuller.  We shared 6 tacos and a torta between us and it was a good amount of food. The torta was one of the stars of the meal with hearty crisped bread, tender pulled pork, and a nice red salsa which added smokiness with a hint of heat and tang to eat bite. It's about the size of hefty panini so one or two more tacos will easily push you to fullness. The tacos themselves were all quite good with perfectly-cooked meats and well-balanced flavors. The short rib was the best all-around taco given its classic savory goodness but the cochinita pibil stood out for its ability to blend complex flavors with a hefty hit of heat that doesn't melt your face but truly adds to the experience of dish. I'd also recommend a pastor taco to end your meal as the generous pineapple chunks make for a naturally sweet dessert-like finish. The most boring taco was the chicken which I probably wouldn't get again. The two other quibbles I had are that the pineapples of the pastor clearly tasted canned and the tortillas had an odd slick and mealy texture which was a little off-putting compared to the steamed or fried corn tortillas you get at other places.  Overall, however, my wife and I had a very enjoyable meal at Bakersfield and would gladly come again. This place is much more laid back and traditional which we enjoy whereas Tako nearby offers a more trendy avant-garde experience that, while fun, seems more a young person's game."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed my meal. I've had a few different things, but I think their short rib taco and the short rib torta might be my favorites. Adding guacamole, queso and/or salsa to the meal never disappointed either!  The tacos are reasonably priced so you can try a few without spending too much. They also have good drink specials, like a Shot of the Day and delicious margaritas.  It gets a bit loud in here if it's packed (which it has been every time I've visited), especially upstairs, so if you're looking for an intimate meal, I'd suggest going during non-peak hours or requesting to sit down stairs."}
{"text":"Came out here for dinner with a big group of friends  on the night before Thanksgiving. We had heard very good things about the place, so we thought of trying it out. We made a reservation before coming in.   We were seated on the lower level. There is a huge table with tools fixed around it. We got a wide assortment of food and drinks. I personally had some 3-4 tacos and a cocktail. I loved the pork belly taco and the steak taco. The tacos are really well made, with lots of interesting ingredients. The cocktail was house made and very refreshing.   Our server was really nice, given that our group was fairly disorganized. They slightly messed up the order of the tacos while serving, and it took us some time to figure out who ordered what, but we sorted that out. All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"I went to Bakersfield last night with a few friends and it was such a great experience! When we got there, the wait was over an hour, however, Joseph was so nice and accommodating. There was a little table open by the bar and Joseph got us situated there while we waited for our actual table to open up. Our server, Chris, was also so nice and attentive. He and Joseph got us appetizers and drinks while we were waiting so the wait didn't seem long at all! Once we were at our table, Chris explained the menu to us and answered any questions we had. Also all the tacos we ordered were amazing. We will definitely be back for the food, but also because Joseph and Chris made it such an awesome experience for us!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Guacamole is Fressssh. Fish taco was my favorite. I also had an amazing corn chowder"}
{"text":"In town for a conference. The town was quiet on a Sunday but when we walked into Bakersfield there was a great energy with all of the folks enjoying themselves. As for the food it was very good, the margaritas were excellent as was the service. It all made for a very enjoyable evening. Will be going back. Tacos with lots of choices is their specialty. Everything made in house!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite taco places not only because the al pastor taco and bistec tacos are amazing but because of the atmosphere. The queso is some of the best as well as the salsa verde. I always have to split marg pitchers with friends when I go. My only complaint is that there is always a wait and it is noisy. They also don't take reservations on the weekends so make sure you check in a head on the nowait app so you don't have to wait as long."}
{"text":"If you're into tacos, Bakersfield will not disappoint. I stopped in for lunch today and was blown away by the tacos. I mean, don't get me wrong, they're still tacos, but these tacos are really good. This is no Chipotle or Qdoba. This is quality (like real quality) food at Bakersfield.   I had a fish, a mole, and a bisteca taco ($4 each). I'd recommend any of them. Their guac is pretty tasty as well.   The restaurant is clean, and also has some available seating outside. The menu is simple and small; just the way it should be. When you do something well, just keep doing it.   I had to go back to work so I could not partake, but they also had an extensive tequila selection. Next time...   Bakersfield has definitely landed on my list of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Bakerfields is one of the places I had bookmarked forever, but never seemed to check it out. My husband & i were looking for something different to do on a Friday night & decided to head here.  London was our server & she was super kind & helpful. I ordered a Bakersfield margarita & she recommended a whiskey sour to my husband. My margarita was perfect and my husbands drink was super strong and interesting  We ordered chips & queso + guacamole. She said the guac is made in house fresh every hour. It really was delicious. Their queso waa also good. Some of the chips were under-cooked which gave them a stale taste but other chips were cooked to perfection (although pretty salty) overall we enjoyed everything. We decided against food because nothing really stood out to us (it was late night & we kind of jusy wanted drinks and an app)  The atmosphere is pretty loud, but fun. Old school bluegrass music plays in the background (even on a hip Friday night.. Not that you can actually hear or get annoyed by it lol) and Western movies play over the bar.  Pretty cool place. We intend on heading back sometime"}
{"text":"I love tacos. It doesn't have to be Taco Tuesday, I came here for Taco Monday.  And for Tostada Monday.  We had a large group and the waitress was very attentive. There is seating at the bar, as well as at the tables.  By the way, I had no idea this place is a chain. It is a great chain restaurant!   We started off with guac and chips- I love my guac and they did a good job.  This is what I ate: Short Rib Tostada: Huge portion, comes on a bed of lettuce leaves. The short rib came with a fried egg, on top of a crispy tostada. Fish Taco: The fried mahi mahi in the taco was good Al Pastor Taco: Delicious pork taco!  They put everyone's taco on a huge plate in the middle of the table. Although the waitress did tell us what the different tacos were, we had so many that it was hard to remember whose was whose.   Overall, great place for taco.. Monday, and tostada... Monday!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try Bakersfield for a late lunch on a beautiful summer day.  Located on W.25th street, Bakersfield is an attractive room with an attractive central bar and a wall open to the patio.  The decor is casual, but sharp with a lot of browns and exposed wood.  The menu of tacos and other Mexican items is a single page, with an extra page of specials.  As opposed to some other places, this is not make your own, rather the items are fully composed and set.  I ended up ordering 3 tacos: spicy mahi mahi, mushroom and baja shrimp.  The tacos came out in a reasonable time and were attractively presented, a pleasure for the eyes.  All tacos come on fresh made corn tortillas which are tasty, but lack the crunch some may be looking for.  The mahi mahi was well cooked but less spicy hot then I thought, overall very tasty.  The mushroom provided a good umami bite, with a soft cheese as a nice contrast.  The best of the tacos was the shrimp, which were lightly battered and perfectly fried large shrimp; they were plump and tasty.  On the side were two bottles of salsa, a mild green salsa and a spicier smokey red salsa.   The biggest problem I had was that with the salsas, the tacos became a bit watery and messy; worth it when they taste this good.  Prices were reasonable, especially since Bakersfield uses quality ingredients.  Bakersfield does not provide free chips and salsa, but you can get some for a couple of bucks.  Overall, I was impressed with the room and the food.  If you are looking for some really good tacos give Bakersfield a try."}
{"text":"Flew in from Boston and looking for a place to grab a quick bite and a few beers. Ended up staying for a few hours and \"sampled\" some of their extensive tequila offerings.  Although the menu was limited, the food was awesome. Had several different made-from-scratch unique tacos. Well prepared and a great spin on southwest/Mexican flair.  The best homemade hot sauce I've had anywhere. Our server Ashley was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and made some great recommendations on the tequilas and food. They have a great team approach to serving so you don't have to wait for anything. I hope they expand to the Boston area."}
{"text":"This is a local hotspot that I was very happy to stumble upon, they do Mexican very good here and provide a nice atmosphere to eat and hang out. I can see why this place was very packed and close to capacity when we went.  - The sauces are amazing, we were given three of them, not sure if there are anymore. The were very good and had nice flavor, I could see myself buying these if they were sold in a store.  - The guacamole was very rich in flavor, highly recommend trying it.  - The tacos were very good, I tried the short rib, pastor, and pibil style tacos and they were very good and the meat was well seasoned. The toppings they offered on them went well with each.  This place is a winner, would love to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"So impressed with Bakersfield CLE. I've been here 3 times since they've opened. The house margarita is killer. The meat in the tacos - be it the crispy Mahi, blackened Mahi, or shrimp or other pork chicken etc. has always been flavorful and tasty. I was skeptical to try the short rib sandwich as many times elsewhere I've had slow roasted and hate the mealy, cooked for hours taste. Not here. They nailed it! Note, the blackened Mahi and shrimp tacos are specials and not found on the website. So if calling in a to go, just ask. I found out about them in reading other Yelp reviews. Yum!  The customer service is outstanding, the manager always available. Such a good feeling knowing you're in good hands. Definitely, recommend! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"tasty cocktails and tacos and tortas! Good service and nice decor."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with most everything here. 5 stars all around.  They put thought into their cocktail menu even barrel aging some of their cocktails, which of course brings up the price point, but my barrel aged Manhattan was fantastic!  They have an excellent whiskey selection as well!  The tacos I ordered where all amazing as well!  Each on was well balanced in flavor and cooked to perfection.  Service was fantastic as well! However, I did visit on a Monday and was only one of two people in the restaurant so I will have to visit again and see if they hold up under a rush as well."}
{"text":"We came in on a whim and what a wonderful surprise greeted us!! Our server, Tyler was amazing,  made wonderful suggestions and delivered ice cold delicious beverages and sizziling hot, perfectly seasoned entrees all chosen by his suggestions!! We'll definitely be back thank you for such a fantastic dining experience!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY- I made it to Bakersfield! I've been wanting to try it since it opened. My friend and I went for our monthly new restaurant dinner. We went on a Thursday night and made reservations, but it was surprisingly not busy. It was a nice night so they had the garage doors opened to the outside, which I enjoy at restaurants.   We had the salsa and black bean dip with chips to start. The black bean dip was my favorite. We both had the house margarita, also very good and strong! It wasn't overly salty or sweet. I then ordered the Willie salad (with some modifications). The salad was alright, but I guess that's what I get for going to a Mexican restaurant and modifying a salad. My friend ordered one of the sandwiches and I tried a bite and it was amazing!! I had order remorse after that. I will be back again and up to try the sandwich or some tacos.   FYI- The parking is mostly street/ meter parking, unless you want to pay for valet at one of the lots close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Used the NoWait app on a friday to get in line for Bakersfield. To provide some perspective, the app showed about a 80 minute wait when i had checked in at 630pm. Not a big deal, but worth noting.  We started the evening with some drinks in the basement of Bakersfield. One thing that stood out was how incredibly hott it was in that basement. 10/15 degrees warmer then the upstairs, with little to no air circulating throughout. We ordered the Jalepeno margarita which was extremely tasty, also sampled were the bakersfield house margarita as well as their seasonal margarita. All which were well above average.  When our table was ready (about 90 minutes from when we checked in) we were all very happy to get out of the heat and upstairs where the air was flowing more freely. Unfortunately upon checking with the hostess we were informed that our table was ready, but it was downstairs, and that a table upstairs would be an additional 30 minute way. No way. We were hungry.  Presented with our table downstairs, we quickly noticed there weren't any chairs. The hostess scrambled around and was able to score 4 chairs after about another 5-7 minute wait. Because our table was in the mx of the downstairs bar scene, our service was shotty at best, and the location of our table brought with it people bumping into us as we ate, and even an instance where another patron thought it was communal seating and sat down right with us.  The food was good, with the salads being the high point of the meal. The tacos are small, but pack flavor and heat. Good for some, not good for all. The chili is hott to the point where its really not that good, and lacks taste and flavor other than heat.  The drinks were on point, the food was average, but the humid basement and chaotic dinner atmosphere turned me off. If you'd ask me if i would go back, i'd tell you yes. If you told me id have an hour and a half wait, id laugh and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"So one of my friends was in the mood for tacos , we decided to give a try to this  place; the reviews in Yelp were pretty decent and what really set my mind , was the fact that they claim they serve HOMEMADE CORN TORTILLAS ...   We sitdown at 8\"55pm , We order some guacamole , it was pretty tasty , the tortilla chips were crispy , salty and limey ; perfect ... we order some Mexican sodas ... they arrive timely , we placed our food order no later than 5 minutes after seating , we were all starving ... so let's say 9\"05pm ? ... 9\"25 comes and no food ... 9\"45 comes , no food ... around 9\"50 a manager comes to our table and told us that our bill has been comped due to a mistake in the kitchen that has delayed our food ... by 9\"55 both the tables behind and in front of us has gotten their food ... they arrived after us !   By then I'm hungry and furious ; I'm like \"this better be the best tacos ever\" ... by exactly 10pm our food arrived ; 7 tacos and two tortas ... let's start with the tortas ; they were nice sized but the bread is not telera roll as is advertised in the menu ; this is more ciabatta ... telera is spongy , soft and dense ... this torta bread is hard shelled and full of air bubbles, it's a nice bread but is not what they advertised ! The milanesa , the filling of this torta , tasted reheated ... you know , that \"it was cooked then refried again\" taste ... I can't stand the taste of reheated chicken so immediately noticed ...   Then the tacos ... omg , the tacos ... was I in for a bad surprise ... the so advertised \"house made tortilla\" was an absolute LIE , the tortillas had the warmth and taste of cold cardboard ... they were not unpleasant, nor they were bad , they were nothing to write about !  The fish taco was good , nice lemony cream on top  , the al pastor was non sense spicy ... let me explain myself here what I mean by that ; it was just hot without a purpose , when I eat spicy , i want to taste something else other than burning my tongue without any other flavor... no garlicky after taste , no fried onion , no smoky deepness or a sweet tingling ... just spicy and that's it ...  The braised beef was good , but nothing worth waiting an hour ! The manager guy came over earlier and he said he would take care of our food ... when we are finish eating our server asked if we needed separate checks ... I'm like \"what?\" ... they comped our food but they didn't comped our drinks ... our soft drinks ... our sodas ... the cheapest items in your menu ... I didn't mind at all paying my 3 dlls for my soda , but it just sounds so petty comping the food and not the drinks ...   Overall the place has a very nice ambiance , our server was attentive , our food was no memorable and it was a good place for eye candy , but I don't think is worth pursuing a second visit , giving that our experience was not the best ..."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the tacos. Went here during lunch and there was no rush. If you try anything out on Penn Ave, stop here!"}
{"text":"3 stars because it was a tad chaotic, service was ehh (understandable b/c just opened) however I was standing at the bar trying to order drinks and the bartender was taking orders of people standing behind me. That really pissed me off... other than that everything was good. Food was good, drinks were good just A-OK.   I will go back again once things settle down."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and Bakersfield is growing on me. The tacos are good, but small. The queso is different, in a good way. It has a baked crust on top and less sweet, more nutty flavors. You may not enjoy it if you are expecting the typical creamy and sweet queso. The salsas on the table were just alright. I prefer more of a chunky salsa and a bolder salsa verde.   The atmosphere is warm and and trendy. The service has been great and the margs strong. I wish the menu had some kind of combo plates since the a la carte menu leaves me wanting more.   The parking is the only thing keeping Bakersfield from being a weekly spot for me. Parking is always painful and frustrating. I get a chuckle every time I see valet for this place as I don't expect or want to valet my car for a ~$15 meal.   I hope Bakersfield hangs around for a while. Would be great to see them lease out some parking spaces in the adjacent shopping center."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Literally never had a bad experience and the food is so amazing! I've had it all from the chips and queso to the tacos and the tostada bowls. All the ingredients they use are super fresh and the recipe they have made for their slaw is perfect. They also make their tortillas in house. Loving the fact they have vegetarian options that can just as easily be made vegan! They also make a superb pineapple margarita and all the margaritas they make can be made spicy !!!  Service is always top notch and the atmosphere is great especially when it's warm out and the big garage style doors can be opened and you can people watch when the weather is nice. Parking can be challenging but there is a parking garage entrance kind of hidden down a few stores in the same strip building. You must check this place out it's perfect for any occasion like a night out with friends to lunch with the family to date night."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My best friend and I came here on a Thursday evening. We had the queso, which is an absolute must!! We had left over chips and they happily brought out salsa for us to finish them off with. Our tacos were amazing. We had pollo rojo, fish and short rib tacos. The owner or manager (I'm not exactly sure who he was) thought one of our tacos was small, so he brought out another for free!! We didn't even notice it was small, but really appreciated his kindness and attention to the quality of his food! Seasonal margarita was awesome, and the prices were excellent. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great tacos small and perfect bar food!! Our waitress was really nice ( Brittany) checked on us constantly and offered suggestions to drinks and food. Our waitress was also helpful in making sure we understood the portion sizes for the tacos I landed on the steak taco it was good but a little over seasoned.   My drink was really good I got the Bakersfield sour it was really really good. Our waitress suggested the watermelon martini which we both decided to get it unfortunately I didn't really like it it was a little too sweet for my taste however my fiancé insisted on getting some Queso. I really don't like cheese as it doesn't sit well in my tummy, usually. however when they bought the Queso  out I did enjoy some of the chips and let me tell you they have the best Queso that I have ever had in my life. The guacamole came out and it was really really fresh I usually eat a little. Of th appetizer to ensure that I save room. But I couldn't stop with the guacamole it was sooooooo good.   The environment was great the bartender was very nice In fact  we started at the bar before we got seats and the as soon as we sat down she asked what we would like! She seemed impressed when I ordered my drink:-) if in the are we will back."}
{"text":"MMMMMMM TACOS!!!      Bakersfield is one of my go to spots downtown. The ambiance is very hip, but also welcoming and warm. The service has always been top notch, even though it seems like they have a high turnover rate, feels like every time I'm there one of my favorite bartenders has recently quit.      The food is very good. Pretty typical Boutique tacos, queso, and tortas. The prices are a little above average but that's to be expected when you're downtown. Every night of the week they have 3$ PBR's and a different 3$ shot, for the drinker on a budget.       They have an upstairs and a downstairs, so even when it's packed there always seems to be just enough room to have your own space.      The only thing that I'm not a fan of is that they refuse to put sports on their TV's. They have old western movies on loop, which I actually really enjoy. However, if there is a Pens, Steelers, or Bucs game on, this is the last place you'll find me."}
{"text":"Omg salt alert!!! This place has got to buy there salt in bulk bc they are heavy handed with the stuff.  We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime.   They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it.    The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend.   I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words.  The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious.  I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates.  The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool. The crowd gave it a good vibe and I could definitely see myself hanging out here if I am in the area again.  If they can only figure out the salt situation this would be a 4 star place."}
{"text":"I visited Bakersfield with a friend for dinner last night at 6pm before attending a concert at Heinz Hall.  They don't take reservations or allow the use of NoWait to get in line ahead of time, so we opted to sit at the bar, given that it was quite busy and that the wait for a table was running 30-40 min.  Fortunately, there were two stools available, so this worked out quite well.  I started out by ordering the Bakersfield margarita ($8), and my friend also ordered one after trying mine.  I agree with another reviewer that it was on the sweet side, but the liberally salted rim provided a nice contrast.  It's served in a ball jar, so I felt that the value for the money was good in terms of quantity, but I'm not sure how strong it was as I didn't feel noticeably buzzed after drinking the whole thing.  For an appetizer, we ordered the chips and guac ($7), which was solid.  The chips, which were served warm, were on the salty side, but they weren't waxy, unlike the chips at some other local establishments.  The guac had chunks of avocado, so you could tell it was freshly made, and its flavor had a great zing from the lime.  Red and green salsas were also provided in squirt bottles of the type used for ketchup, etc.  While I enjoyed the red one more than the green one, I wasn't a huge fan of either, given that they seemed rather watery and that I prefer larger chunks in my salsa.  Despite being described as mild and medium, both salsas had a spicy kick, so I recommend applying them lightly at first if you're spice-averse.  For our entree, my friend and I ordered two tacos each.  We both ordered the pork belly pastor ($4), I ordered the huitlacoche ($4), and my friend ordered the hongos ($3).  The huitlacoche taco, which consisted of corn and corn \"truffles\" (smut), as well as some other veggies, had a very earthy and complex flavor, and was unlike any taco I'd ever tried before.  According to my friend, the hongos taco, whose main ingredient was mushrooms, also had an earthy flavor, but it probably was more subbdued than the earthiness of the huitlacoche taco.  Both of us enjoyed the pork belly pastor taco, which, in addition to the titular ingredient, included pineapple and peppers that gave it a bit of a spicy kick.  We both felt that the tacos were on the small side, esp. given the price, so I recommend planning on 3 apiece if you're hungry.  At the time of our visit, the noise level was extremely high due to the crowd.  Unlike one of their nearby competitors, they don't play high volume music to drown out the sound of people talking, but it's just as challenging to carry on a conversation with your dining partner.  Service was generally good, though it could be (understandably) challenging to attract the attention of the bartender given that the crowd kept her working hard during the duration of our visit.  There was some slight awkwardness with the check, given that she knew we were paying separately but didn't provide us with separate checks, but it wasn't a huge deal given that there ended up being only a $1 difference between our totals.  Overall, we were generally pleased with our meal at Bakersfield, and would return, if at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Great place! I have been holding off going there from my \"Longboards\" hangover! Longboards was the previous establishment and I loved it. Just discovered it too late (a few months before it closed). :) Anyways, parking was easy! Is it like most places uptown, in regards to parking? Yes! You just have to be patient! They do offer FREE valet, so that's good ! The decor inside is cool! Johnny Cash cool! Loved the barrel tables! We sat at the bar! I saw a nice mixture of people in the crowd. I disagree that one of the previous reviews said \"holy hipster\"!  The bartenders (all three ) were very attentive! Cobra is a sweetheart! They have my favorite beer, Sol, in bottles and it's only $3 per! A great start! Cobra was very helpful in making food recommendations! The  queso is outstanding! The best I've ever had! The previous review said otherwise! I totally disagree! It was awesome! Tacos were very good, too! We had 2 beers, sangria, queso, tacos and were stuffed! And the bill was only $27! We will be back! Great place, great food, great ambience and decor and even better bartenders!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! My tacos were very delicious with great flavor. The pineapple margaritas ARE BEYOND GOOD! My waiter was VERY slow addressing my table. Other than my waiter, I had a great experience. I would go back due to the awesome drinks and food."}
{"text":"I used to work here and I still go for the food and drinks. Amazing damn margs, lemon and lime squeezed fresh, no fake crap tasting juice. And the tacos are to die for. It's very inexpensive as well so you're not going to break the bank going there!!!!!"}
{"text":"As a person who has eaten many CLE tacos, these are the best tacos in The Land. At the same price as Barrio, you can't beat it. The queso is amazing too. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. Will definitely be back!! Strongly recommend the fish, mole and short rib tacos. It's not the monster of a taco you'll get at Barrio, but the quality is amazing. Bakersfield is a must for any taco-loving Clevelander. The sangria could be better but all in all a great taco place."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks each time I have been, however the parking is still a slight pain. I know that particular business spot has struggled with it for years. The service can be a little slow at times but it is a fun place."}
{"text":"Still relatively new to the downtown area, this restaurant seems to have found it's crowd, as some evenings it's almost impossible to get a seat at the bar. The dining room isn't huge, so it does fill up rather quickly. I like it here.  I've been here a few times, as I work just around the corner, and will stop by for a beer after work. The prices are decent, they have a shot-of-the day special each night, I think. They seem to specialize in tequila, although there's a decent selection overall to choose from. It is a full bar, after all.  The food is mostly tacos, tex-mex, etc...The chips and guacamole are good, and the selection of tacos should satisfy just about anyone's tastes. From chicken, to fish tacos, to pork belly, to mushroom veggie tacos, there's a wide range of different flavors and ingredients available to order.  If interested in trying this place, try lunch sometime, as evenings can and do get crowded pretty quick. Still, it might be worth the wait."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on a Tuesday night.  It is extremely loud inside. Louder than Cabo Fish Taco. Limited seating too.  Had the the premium margarita. It's small and over priced.  Queso was good but was served w our tacos.   No pacing to enjoy your company or your thirteen dollar margarita.  Tacos came out almost immediately after the order was placed. They were cold and you you can tell food is pre-prepared and not fresh.  I enjoy hot food that's fresh. If I wanted reheated I'd have left overs.  Waitress attentive but obviously wanted my friend and I to leave so her table would turnover. I don't recommend and would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this joint! My boyfriend and I visited this past Sunday and got a table with no reservation. The tacos are great and everything is reasonably priced. Chips and salsa, 5 tacos, and two beers was $35. I highly recommend the pork belly pastor taco!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a rainy fall like day in Cleveland in May lead us to Bakersfield taco! This place recently opened about a monthly ago and it's been a good bit of talk going around about it. I will say most of the talk I've heard has been very positive though.   To start with the inside is nice, and when it's hot the doors and windows open and you are able to sit outside on the patio which is nice. As for the food I was very satisfied and full when I left. This visit I ordered a order of the queso dip as the appetizer and a few tacos for the main course. The queso is different than what you would regularly find at other places. Instead of being the white American cheese based queso this one is white cheddar based which is very different but tasted incredibly tasty. Now for the tacos which include a Pollo Rojo, Fish Taco, cochinota pibil taco(very spicy), Biztec taco and short rib taco. All were very good and quite filling. The handmade corn tortillas were right on point! I recommend all of these taco choices but as a side note make sure to ask for the Salsa in the glass for an extra kick. This fish taco was seasoned well however I would have liked for it to be a bit crisper. Besides that as the weather gets better in Cleveland, this will be a go to summer taco spot! Also the service was really good!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place around. Reasonably priced food and drinks. I have probably tried every taco and enjoyed all of them. Do not pass on the fish taco, it's the best thing there."}
{"text":"Best queso I've ever had.  Many folks complain about the parking situation, but they lease parking spots at Jersey Mikes and some other places nearby after 7pm.  Just call and ask where to park.  All of the salsas and hot sauce are made fresh every other day. The manager came by my table and warmly chatted with us for a bit, gave some good recommendations.  This joint is a pretty hopping watering hole Friday and Saturday nights. I'm not a regular here yet, but I will be soon because I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Came by on Labor Day weekend for dinner with a large party. The staff and our waitress were very friendly and accommodating. Our friend group is prone to injuries and they were very attentive in helping our friend with a cast be comfortable. We loved the appetizers and nommed on way too much queso. I loved the warm chips and I think I made a mistake by not leaving enough room for my entree. Most of our table ordered tacos and they came out on a large tray which was very confusing. All of the food I tried was tasty and flavorful. Will definitely be back for a date night after skipping lunch so I can try more items on the menu. I'm also dying to try their sangria, it looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks too. The wait was long but the food and service made up for it. Everyone enjoyed their plates immensely."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos I loved the chicken taco and the chips and salsa were good too.  I had the spicy margarita and Caitlin the bartender waited on me she was awesome and super friendly.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We started our taco tour of Pittsburgh here tonight. This one may be tough to top. Started off with house margarita on the rocks with salt.  Quite tasty and very refreshing. Time for apps. We tried queso and guacamole. The queso was my 12 year old's favorite and he is super picky about queso. Burnt layer of cheese on top of some super yummy queso.  The chunky guac was very tasty too. On to the tacos. The 12 year old went basic with chicken, cheese and sour cream. He gave it a 9 out of 10.  I had the spicy chicken and a shrimp taco. Spicy chicken was a flavor explosion. The shrimp taco was even better. In fact, it was probably the best shrimp taco I have ever eaten. Very impressed. Our server Brendon was great.  The manager, McKenzie, was amazing. They took great care of us and talked to my son about taco tour.  Glad we chose here to start."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place, while my dad was in the hospital. It was really close to CMC- Main. Great walk to clear your mind by the way. Nice tex-mex food. Chips and Salsa were good. I'll rate what I had in order 1)Short Rib 2)Cochonita 3) Pollo Rojo 4) Al Pastor... Great bar set up."}
{"text":"I thought this place was delicious, but my husband was not thrilled whatsoever. They don't really have the option for regular ol' beef tacos but they were very accommodating in getting him just that. He said they weren't great though. I had an al pastor, short rib, and portobello and all were excellent. The salsa is green salsa so beware it isn't the typical fare. I loved it, once again husband did not."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots in Pittsburgh when my husband and I come to visit. The atmosphere is upbeat and fun. We eat here every time we are in the city! Great service, amazing tacos, and the BEST margaritas around! We have never had a bad meal. We have also been to the Columbus and Cleveland locations and we have never been disappointed! Prices are excellent, you won't burn a hole in your pocket! We love Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is hands down my favorite spot in Charlotte for margaritas and queso. Their queso is the best I've ever had and the margaritas are excellent. Their tacos are also flavorful and delicious - my personal favorites are the pork belly and the steak tacos. The atmosphere is really cool and the service is friendly and efficient. I'd recommend this place any day."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great drinks and even better queso and tacos!  Definitely worth the wait and there's usually seating at the bar anyway. I know people from Texas who come here just for the margaritas"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite and have a yummy drink! The atmosphere is really nice, the place looks great! It's pretty loud in there, the tables for two are very close to each other so if you are looking for some privacy during the dinner, might not be the best place! Our server Liz was very nice and attentive. We had 6 different tacos (all were very tasty) and 2 spicy margaritas! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and chips & guac/queso were a little pricey but tasty. Nice sized drinks and I really liked that the queso was baked. The tacos, however, were a let down. I got the most popular chicken taco and the special Baja shrimp taco. Tortillas were very rubbery and the filling was incredibly acidic. The only bright note for the tacos was the actual shrimp in the special taco. I couldn't even finish the chicken taco. Stick to the drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"A big group of us popped in unexpectedly on a Monday for lunch. Dakota and Lana didn't miss a beat and took impeccable care of us. There's an awesome all-inclusive deal for $15 (we had ~20) that included apps, salad, and tacos. Plus some margarita pitchers, everyone paid $23. Awesome deal. Thanks, Lana and Dakota!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so amazing.   The spicy margarita was really good and the pitcher was really big and well priced.  The ingredients are really fresh and the tacos remind me of being out west.   What really made our dinner was our server Kristen .   We came in late after being on the road all day.   We were traveling from Columbus to NYC and decided to stop of in Pittsburgh because we had never been.  She was really friendly and energetic and made our night in Pittsburgh awesome.  Thanks Kristen!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! I love the unique selection and for a good price with drinks. I'm personally not a fan of corn tortilla but the fillings here made up for it. We tried a little if everything and got some soup for a light lunch. The corn chowder and the chorizo chili are delicious and hearty ...so amazing my dad ordered another one!!I would totally imagine the place got busy at night but for lunch, it was not crowded at all.   I recommend the steak taco and the pulled-pork but I would have wanted to try everything if I could fit it. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a Pens game this last Wednesday around 10:30. The place was pretty busy, but we were fortunate enough to find 4 seats left at a standing bar.   The servers were fairly quick and attentive, though toward the end of our stay a bit less. We waited a long time for our waiter to come by so we could ask for a check.   Food was pretty good! I ordered the Bistec tacos, which had a bit of a kick to them. Unfortunately, that kick was the only flavor in them.   Also, the margaritas were okay. Really sweet. But ok.   All in all, this \"trendy\" looking bar wasn't awesome, but it was okay. They seemed to put more energy into Edison bulbs and appealing to the mustachioed 20-something, rather than the food and drinks themselves.   That's just me. I'm in Austin, so the hipster stuff isn't so dumbfounding to me anymore. But I think this bar could back up that hipster BS with a little authenticity."}
{"text":"Not a friendly atmosphere. The front table was our choice however we only had 5 people and we were told that the manager did not allow less than 6 to sit there. Even the manager this morning told us that and so we were treated not so welcome The restaurant was empty and that table was empty the entire time we were there. Poor decision to make any customer feel unwelcome.  The food was good but not great and the parking situation was prohibitive As a native Charlotte guy I will not go back Nor will I recommend to any of my friends So many Great places to choose from in Charlotte Good Luck Bakersfield East"}
{"text":"Fun and favorable interpretation of Mexican cuisine. Creative reinterpretation.  Not for people looking for the real thing.  Upscale/trendy and thoroughly enjoyable.  Loud humming and with long waits on a Saturday night. Yelp waitlist feature worked well.  Extremely good value ($54 for party of 5).  Loretta Salad was phenomenal with its light spicy chipotle vinaigrette. Server was great but had to yell over loud DJ music and buzzing crowd singing alone.  In a word.  FUN!"}
{"text":"Went to Bakersfield after a suggestion from a friend. We will be sticking to Täko in the future.   Great first pitcher of margs then the second pitcher was just marg mix-definitely no tequila. Tacos were super dry and cold- the shrimp and the fish were very dry and almost unpalatable.   $111 for cold dry tacos- no thanks!!"}
{"text":"After a very disappointing first trip to Bakersfield, a manager was kind enough to contact us and apologize.  He didn't try to make excuses or justify anything, just let us know that the communication broke down somewhere between staff members, and he'd like for us to come back and give them another chance.  This in and of itself speaks volumes for the restaurant, as not many are willing to reach out and really care that their customers have a fantastic experience when they dine with them.  We stopped back in this evening, and it was night and day.  The waitress was fantastic, the drinks were very well-crafted, and the food was excellent.  For the price point, which is a very reasonable $4 a taco, the quality of the food is very good.  We tried the corn dip (I can't remember the name, but essentially like a dip version of Mexican street corn), and we each tried a couple of different tacos.  Unlike a lot of taco places, where you can only taste sour cream, generic salsa, and some guacamole, these were very thought out...the crispy shrimp with pickled fresnos was a personal favorite.  All in all, I'm going to say that my first negative experience was a fluke on a busy night (there was a Pirates game, a Pens game, the Arts festival, and a show at the Benedum, so I'm not surprised that it was hectic), and that Bakersfield is an excellent dining option and we will certainly be back.  Very glad we gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"I came here for a recent Yelp event. I can't speak to the whole menu but the tacos they served were delicious. The corn tortillas are handmade everyday, along with the guacamole. The tortilla chips were fresh. My favorite taco was the battered mahi mahi taco. It came served with a fresh lime.   For drinks, they served flavored water. I also ordered a margarita and an old fashion. The old fashion wasn't my favorite but it had more to do with the dark liquor than the actual drink itself. The margarita was made well and rimmed with salt.  The atmosphere was was relaxed. The decor was industrial mixed with country. Country music played through the speakers.  I'd come back again based on my experience."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pineapple margaritas that fulfill all my pineapple dreams.  For real though, this place is pretty dope. My sexy husband and I came here the other night. We got shitfaced on tacos and tortas. By the end of the night we had stuffed are dumb faces so much that we had to be rolled all the way back home. I'm pretty bummed at how loud it gets in this place though, but that might of been because it was Saturday and the place was filled with dudes looking to get their dicks wet.  Overall though, I give this place two big pineapple thumbs up.  **Edit** I bumped my review to 5 stars because the owners response to my review was fucking hilarious. Keep up the good work, my dude!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, really cool looking space but definitely use their valet or park on a side street and DO NOT PARK IN THE CONDO DECKS next door as they were towing cars tonight. Good to have a good taco place nearby as Cantina makes their move down to Park Rd."}
{"text":"Went to Bakersfield for the first time last night.  It was awesome!! We started with the guacamole which was very good Then between my girlfriend and I we ordered six different tacos so that we didn't have any of the same thing She only ate two of hers... More for me!! So I ended up stuffing my face and eating four tacos: Mole, short rib, Pork belly and the steak taco My only complaint about the taco was the steak taco had a lot of stuff on it and could barely be contained in the tortilla so it was a little difficult to eat but still delicious!  Otherwise all was good!!  The parking situation is difficult We ended up having to park across the street in the jersey mikes lot Is there a designated lot for Bakersfield?!"}
{"text":"Second time in Pittsburgh, and my girlfriend and I decided to grab a late night dinner and drinks near the hotel. Bakersfield simply couldn't have been better. Between the two of us, we ordered two Bakersfield margaritas, a short rib tostada, chips and guac, and two tacos: one bistec and one pollo rojo. The guac was fresh and incredible, and actually had a nice amount of spice to it. Same can be said with the tostada and tacos. They were packed with so much flavor, especially the short rib tostada, which melted in your mouth. Margaritas were spot on, and the mason jar sized serving felt about right. Atmosphere was fun (it was packed around 1230am) and lively. No question, we would come back."}
{"text":"The food is beyond great, but I'd like to talk about the service. So what could have been a bad experience turned into a great a memorable experience. When seated we waited 15-20 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order. Paige the bartender made eye contact came right over listened to us took our order and immediately got her manager Alex involved. Alex came over apologize and let us know how he was going to correct the issue for us. Appetizers were so good that we ordered that  we were to busy to noticed that we were still waiting another 15- 20 minutes before realizing that our dinner order had not been taken. I went over to Paige she came right over with pen and paper apologized again and took our order. She owned the experience never made an excuse apologized and even made her recommendations on the menu. We ordered what she recommended and was very satisfied!! Alex the manager came back over apologized again and it was truly ok at this point. We didn't have time to focus on what didn't go right because Paige made it right and perfect! It was a mistake not hers....and we appreciate the fact again the Paige only being there for three days took charge didn't blame anyone owned our experience and corrected it!! I will definitely be back and I recommend going for the great food and service!! Thank you again Paige and Alex for taking good care of us, not being rude and correcting the issue. Alex you have an great employee and as a facilitator for a major company I would like you to know that she's a keeper!! Paige I can't say thank you enough for your stepping in and not just passing it along because you're new. Great leadership to you both!! BAKERSFIELD TACOS because of Paige I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, great food, fantastic prices! Love the atmosphere and location. Andrew was our server and he was so helpful, knowledgeable, and personable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and country music in the background.  Pretty reasonable priced w drink specials.  The specialty is bourbon and tequila, waitress wasn't sure if they even had gin.  Fish tacos and pork belly were top notch"}
{"text":"Living in SoCal most of our lives it's hard to find true street tacos. Spending mNy a weekend in Baja Mexico and eating off of street carts it's even harder. I first tried Bakersfield in Indy. Great experience... The Charlotte location was was NOT a disappointment.   The service was great.  Very friendly server and very attentive.  The tacos were spot on!! Definitely will be back... The only Con is the lack of parking as it's a bit dicey during peak hours."}
{"text":"I came into Bakersfield two weeks ago on a Friday night with a rather large party of friends (7). We hadn't made a reservation, so we happily agreed to wait the suggested hour for seating. We all purchased a few rounds of drinks from the bar while we waited for a table to open up. When the host grabbed us to sit, we were happy and ready to eat, however, he put us at a high top round table where we were a little crammed. It was a chillier night and the garage doors were open as well as the fans running on high. We first requested that the fans be turned lower if possible, which was quickly denied by the male host. We then kindly asked if we could be moved a few spots down to a large picnic table (that was vacant), so we could have more space for our large party as well as be a little further away from the fans. Again, our request was denied. The host informed us that the table was being held for a reservation that was about to be seated. We waited about 15 minutes and that table still had not been filled. A party did eventually move there but it was a total of 4 people. I don't understand why they couldn't have moved us (party of 7) to a table that made much more sense, and moved the smaller party that had not even arrived yet to the high top that we were at. The most disappointing factor in all of this is how rude the host was. I have worked in the restaurant industry and am well aware that the host is often the face of the company and the first interaction a guest has. His foul attitude towards us made our entire evening rather dismal. Our server was able to have the fans shut off, which we greatly appreciated, but having such poor service from the host stand really left a foul taste in all our mouths. Half of the guests with me were first timers and do not plan on returning :/"}
{"text":"Matt W really took care of my group. He recommended all the right drinks and food and was a ton of fun through our meal. THANKS MATT!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always so nice here. The veggie taco is my favorite, and there is a new special every day."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here earlier today. Brought my dog on the patio and Andrew was very accommodating with water bowls. The short rib tostado is amazing as well. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best tacos in Charlotte. My husband and I drive 30 minutes to go here for tacos. Also, the margaritas are awesome! If you like heat, go for the spicy version of any of their margaritas. The spicy pineapple one is definitely my favorite though. The Cochinita Pibil tacos are SO good. They are just the right amount of spicy and savory. The fish (crispy mahi) tacos and shrimp tacos are also really good. They are very crispy but yet the mahi is still flaky and delicious! Also, you cannot go wrong with ordering their Queso, especially with Jalapeños on it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! The tacos are reasonably priced and they have the best on the rocks margarita I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Had the chips and salsa, guacamole, and tried most of the tacos. Can't go wrong with any of it. Great service as well and a cool, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would really say 4.5 but yelp keeps it simple. If you go, get yoself a pitcher! Their margs are good! You'll be glad you did. I was impressed with their cheese dip too (app) no one else does cheese dip like this around clt. It comes in a little mini skillet with cheese like blow torched on top? Idk but get it, it's delish. You have to pay for chips and dip here so might as well get some queso! Just like at rurus. ... We did wait several mins for our waitress to greet us, we came early so they weren't packed yet (no wait yet either - that's the trick too since they get busy and no reservations). Once she came she did a great job and our pitcher and app came out in mins. We ordered some tacos (they are small and not bad priced) she said \"if you want to order more just tell me they come out so fast!\" And of course we believed her. But then...that took the longest. And we literally got 3 total so we were kinda like wtf? Anyways, I liked everything I had and the inside is pretty cool looking."}
{"text":"Neat environment for a drink, and a good Margarita made it worth the trip. Disappointed in the poor chips and salsa and very small tacos"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was awesome. Matt aka Chewy was our waiter(ask him to do the chewy noise, it's on point ) Long long list of tequila and whiskeys as well as beer on tap. Really cool environment. Super clean and crisp with sharp looking design."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is great. Taco's and margarita's. it crowded but in a good way. Bartender was really nice even though it was crowded. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant called Bakersfield?!?! Hmmm seemed a little suspect to me...   This place is good, but I have to say if you like traditional Mexican, this isn't it. Now if you like a cool, hip small plates food establishment with some killer spicy margaritas, you may have found the right place. I call it 'Dilworth Mexican'.   Anything short ribs is good (sorta, taco, etc).... and again, the spicy margarita is good, just make sure they muddle the jalapeño and be ready to get the sweats.   Parking is a mess. 'nuff said about that."}
{"text":"I read a newspaper review proclaiming the tacos here to be the best in Cleveland. I respectfully disagree. I'm all for a more Americanized take on tacos. But in that department, Barrio still has Bakersfield beat. These tacos will run you about $4 each. I had the al pastor which was relatively flavorless and a chicken one whose name I cannot remember. The latter was also pretty poorly seasoned and a little dry. The best part of our meal was a) the service. Even with a full house, our server was awesome. b) The drinks. Pineapple margarita! So refreshing and c) the queso dip with chorizo. Four tacos, two drinks and a dip cost about $50 without tip."}
{"text":"Ordered the corn chowder special which was great as well as the carnitas taco special which was a bit bland. From the regular menu I ordered the shrimp taco, fish taco, and short rib taco. On all of the tacos the meat wasn't quite seasoned properly and was a bit bland. I couldn't justify $4 each for individual tacos there again after being dissapointed by the flavor.  Did not order any drinks but the drink menu seemed very overpriced, $10 for a margarita in a small Mason jar is too much.  Service was fantastic! Our waitress walked us through the menu, made recommendations on what we might like, checked on us regularly but not too much, and just overall was very kind and helpful.   I would maybe try it again in the future if I was in the area but would more likely find somewhere else to eat on that stretch of East Boulevard."}
{"text":"For a downtown bar/restaurant, this place is cheap and cool.  I'm not into \"trendy\" places, and while this fits that bill, it also has a pretty cool vibe ... with cool music!   We were here for happy hour and a large group -- 10 of us.  The drink prices were cheap and there was a whiskey special of some kind.   They also have a deal for large groups -- they bring you a sampling of basically the entire menu. Now, when this usually happens, there's never enough food for everyone and you feel bad taking two of something.  We stuffed ourselves and had leftovers that we split to take home. If you're here with a large party, I highly recommend it rather than ordering apps and separate meals.  Parking downtown can be a nightmare ... especially if there is any type of sporting event or a busy night in the cultural district. If you're driving, be sure to use the Park PGH app to see what garages are open before you get into town."}
{"text":"I will preface this review saying I didn't eat anything but the chips and guac BUT I have eaten at the Bakersfield in Columbus.   I loved the atmosphere and over decor of Bakersfield. My sister, boyfriend, and I walked in this past weekend for a few drinks around 6:30 pm on Saturday. It was crowded. We were informed of a 30 minute wait for a table so we decided to stand at one of their bar tables. The wait staff was very attentive even to us standing. We all ordered a beer along with an order of chips and guac for the three of us to share. Both the chips and the guac were fresh and the guac was on the chunky side. We were also given 2 salsas to try.   I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I tried not to have high expectations but I was still slightly disappointed with the tacos.   The chicken tacos was too spicy for my liking and the cubed pork taco was so bland that all I tasted was pineapple. Just didn't like either of the tacos.   The margarita was strong and the atmosphere was nice though.  Update: I am willing to give Bakersfield another shot thanks to the kindness of their service manager."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming here for tacos during the week. I am told the margaritas are great (I don't drink, though), but i LOVE the chips and queso! Try the fish taco or short rib taco- my favorites!"}
{"text":"Went downtown before a concert and happened to find this place.  It was the first place where the staff was actually friendly to us so we stayed.  I loved the decor.  We tried one of the daily special shots and the guacamole.  I LOVE guacamole and he said it's made fresh.  Very good!  I rarely go downtown but I will probably make an exception to come back and try more of the food & a margarita!  Can't give it a full 5 star until I've tried a little more."}
{"text":"I will start off with parking, across the street unless it is rush hour than you can park in the lot on the other side of the convention center or along the street around the same place even during rush hour and its only about 3 blocks away.  Decor is really great, barn wood and Edison bulbs... whats not to like.. expect the seating, it's a small place and sitting less than 6 inches from the table next to you is not comfortable however if you have a larger party there are picnic style tables...   Staff is warm, friendly and inviting and will help with any questions.   The alcohol is great and the mixed drinks are tasty, and arrive in a mason jar, I preferred the red wine sangria which came with plump raspberries.  The food... a limited menu to say the least.. and for me it was very hard to understand, since I am not to well versed in the lingo, we ordered a variety of tacos and I would say the best where the fish and  pineapple Style. The mushroom though seemingly good was very spicy. I would also highly recommend the chips and queso. Though the food wasn't bad you can get better tacos from the pittsburgh taco truck... just saying. ..  BUT  All and all it was good  and we had a great time..."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The $3 shot of the day and $9 torta milanesa is an incredible deal, and it's a ton of great food for the price. Parking is easy, service is always awesome - it's one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"We had a large group and our server Tyler had 3 other tables of 10+ people and I've never had better service. Amazing food, great service, really good margs...Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Pittsburgh for a margarita and fish taco. All of their tacos are great, but the guacamole is to die for."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the hype. The staff at the bar is great! They were 100% on point for being VERY busy. The drinks, we just had beers, were good. The queso with chorizo was great.  We waited an hour for a table and decided to order food to go. It arrived quickly,  we paid and left. We were missing a taco (we ordered 8 items and were missing one.... unacceptable.)  Overall? I'd go back for a drink and some queso dip. Not much else."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Our waitress (I wish I remembered her name) was awesome. I loved the whole indoor/outdoor vibe and this style of Mexican is my favourite. The place was full and vibe was great on a Friday night. They had the game on too so bar area was full. We had to wait about 15 minutes For a table but that's not crazy.  Everyone in my group loved their cocktails. The chips and various salsas were delicious. I could literally drink the salsa verde.  The tacos we tried all delicious.  If I'm back in Cleveland I'd definitively stop here again."}
{"text":"Needed some tasty food to fuel up on a sub-arctic night before the Steelers playoff game and Bakersfield was a winner.  Also have the mightiest bourbon menu I've seen in the entire state.   Packed house but they got us in fast and the taquitos were outrageously flavorful.  We had 5 different ones and can recommend each heartily: -Fish -Beef -Pork -Mole -Pollo Rojo  Mad props as well to our excellent server Ashley--wonderful service and true bourbon expertise."}
{"text":"Second time here in 2 weeks. Great atmosphere with fast service. Went last night with a party of 7, ordered some apps and without even asking the waitress split the shared items amongst everyone. Coming from LA where it's like pulling teeth to get separate bills, this was amazing. The pork belly taco is by far the best! Highly recommend it. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great drinks, good food and a fun atmosphere.  That's what you get when you go to Bakersfield.  The early crowd is a mix of people in their 30s and 40s.  Great place for happy hour if you're by yourself or just meeting a friend after work.  Everyone is pretty friendly so it's easy to meet people.  The later crowd is when the groups start filing in.  The \"let's take shots because we're in our 20s and am not going to pay for it the next day\" groups can get a little loud on the weekend, but not too bad on the weekdays.  The food is solid overall.  My personal favorites are the salsa, guac, Johnny salad, short rib Torta, and Bistec and Huitlacoche tacos.  Beware of the Chochinita taco...when they say hot, they mean five alarm fire hot!  Those of you who think, \"oh please, I can handle hot food.  I can handle this taco.\"  Well be prepared to bring a box of tissues, because I guarantee you'll be in tears from the heat coming off of this taco.  Don't say I didn't warn you!  The margaritas are the big winner.  Made fresh and they use good tequila.  The spicy one is really good, but depending on the bartender, you may want to ask them to cut out the spicy parts of the jalapeno if you just want the flavor (and not the heat).  Overall, this is a really fun place.  It's a great place if you're looking to meet hot guys/girls, or if you just want to sit at one of the large bench tables with a group of friends and hang out.  Good luck parking, but definitely take advantage of the valet across the street after hours on the weekend."}
{"text":"Tried this spot out the day after it opened. The tacos were some of the best I have had. We got a pitcher of the Margarita which was pretty good as well  The best thing Though: queso (with black beans, chorizo and jalapeños). Ridiculously good!  Will definitely be returning in the future"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a cool little bar with a Mexican themed menu and country-bluegrass tunes pumping through the speakers. We enjoyed both even though they don't sound like they'd mesh. The bar was casual and trendy. Not really Mexican themed. It seemed there was a bit of an identity crisis going on, but it didn't bother me. The staff were very attentive but not necessarily interactive with the patrons except maybe a couple they knew. In that regard, I didn't feel extremely welcomed.   The Paloma cocktail was tasty at $10. The guac was fresh, just basic with chunks of avocado, and the warm chips were light and perfectly salted. The tacos were gorgeous and the house made tortillas were delicious. We ordered three though and two of them, the short rib and the fish, even though the ingredients were fresh, lacked any flavor. The textures were nice. The fried fish was flavorless and dry. I'd have preferred a fish taco with grilled fish, but they didn't offer one. The short rib was blah as well. There seemed to be a lot of untapped potential in them. There was a good amount of ingredients with each taco being about 5-6 small bites, so nice for sampling and sharing. The chicken taco on the specials list was better with a good amount of heat. They definitely had a good start here with the fresh imaginative ingredients."}
{"text":"It's an odd day when I find a great place via a recommendation from my wife's stylist, but there you have it.   I had a hankering for some Mexican food.  Still been trying to find that one place in Charlotte that'll quench my unending cravings for tortillas and salsa. When my wife was getting her hair trimmed at Level 42, her stylist Kerri told her about Bakersfield.  Seriously tacos at Bakersfield?  The name didn't grab me, but she insisted that I'd love the food.  Ok. You had me at Mexican.    We headed over there and arrived just after it opened at 11AM.  As is our way, we headed to the bar and situated ourselves right in front of the bartender.  Kaycee was cutting limes and creating all sorts of concoctions for their various and neverending varieties of mixed drinks.  She offered us the menu and adult beverage bible which we perused.  But of course it was the beer we were looking at more so than the mixed beverages.  Their brews were unremarkable,  but just good enough to keep us plopped in our stools.  We got an IPA from Birdsong: Say it to Your Face.  Let me just say Yuck, but that's not the establishments fault.  Must have a great beer representative there.  Birdsong can and does do better...I digress.  We sipped the beers a bit and looked over the menu. Kaycee kept us entertained telling us about her travel stories and living through several of mine.  She just kept cutting those limes and setting up the bar all the while she served us and offered up some great tips for our ventures in the area.  The menu was pretty good. Lots of choices. I wanted to get the Milinesa Torta, but we decided to split a Chicken Chorizo Tostada.  At $8, I was a little skeptical.  And my skepticism was justified. You really don't get enough when you consider it's Mexican food.  Very inexpensive ingredients.  I thought there would be a bit more.  Regardless, it was very good and even splitting it with my wife hit the spot.    Although I didn't care for the beer all that much, I did partake in a 2nd.  About this time Kaycee rotated to other matters and Elenore came in and took over the challenge of keeping me smiling.  I must say Elenore is a gem.  She told us she was in Charlotte to work with the staff, but her home restaurant is in Ohio. She'd been here a month and spent most of her time working, working, working.  She also told us about her experiences, compared notes, asked us about our food and service, talked about the other restaurants in their company, and invited us back.  Never did the conversation or entertainment faulter...even when she was pressed on all sides for drinks and questions.  By far the best service I've ever had in Charlotte. Between Kaycee, Elenore, and the rest of the staff I had a blast.  The food? A bit pricey.  The Drinks? Never tried the liquor,  but the selection was crazy good. The beer was a bit weak.    All in all, it was the service I liked best here.  The staff and the atmosphere was perfect.  I'd like to come back and I likely will. Elenore is headed back to Ohio but will return March 30 through April 10.  My wife and I will return as well.  We are also excited to hear about their plans for expanding their fried chicken concepts: Yes please.  5 for service. Food is a 2.5 and the beer is a 2.  Liquor and all their mixed drink concoctions are easily a 5.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've eaten in ages!!!!   Pastor, Fish and Mole!! All fantastic with incredible fresh toppings!! Don't get me started on the short rib!! Totally melt in your mouth tender!  Beer from a glass boot! Ginormous Mason Jar margaritas!  Okay ladies, so now you know I like my Guacamole chunky! Love the \"smashed\" avocados with big chunks - would hit a pocket of lemon juice or hot sauce that gave it some major mojo flavor!  The décor is over the top cool! Super swanky Roadhouse!! Let me pinch myself! Am I in Austin, Texas? Or Charlotte?  Super fast servers! Free valet parking across the street!  So what's the deal? Bakersfield is actually one of five, with most based in Ohio and Indiana. Who whudda thunk it? Not me. Well, they're looking to expand. If all of them are like this, then they have a formula for success. I will need to rent a car and visit all of them!! Or maybe I'll just live in a tent on top of this one!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Tex-Mex restaurants opening up in Charlotte for some reason and i have yet to fully enjoy any of them more than I did this place.   Most important - Drinks: I had both the Bakersfield Margarita and the Premium Margarita. I didn't find either of them to be amazing but I definitely liked the Bakersfield more than the Premium. The Bakersfield was too bitter and the Premium was too acidic (heart burn at second sip). However, neither of the two were \"weak\", if you know what i mean.   Food: Started off with the Chips and Queso...added the jalapenos, amazing. They have special house made sauces that elevates just about everything to perfection - Well done! The fish taco was really good. It wasn't mushy, it was crispy but i found the soft mini taco to not hold well. The short rib taco was really good and flavorful.   Location: The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, the rustic modern works. I do also appreciate the layout, it works. I also really like the added touch of the two lean up tables behind the bar for those waiting for a table as we did (25 mins on a Tuesday evening, can't imagine a weekend).   Service: Everyone was really friendly.  I will say, parking is an issue."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to this place and I was not disappointed. The guacamole is excellent I had a short rib taco that was delicious they actually make a taco shell's in house. They have a jalapeño margarita and quite a bourbon selection definitely ahead and I will be back!"}
{"text":"How happy am I that all these taco joints have been appearing all over Pittsburgh these last few years?  Very.  Bakersfield is a little bit low-key in the sense that the name doesn't evoke tacos and tequila so much as it does gin cocktails and upholstered walls.  But it's the real deal, folks.  Nice little street-style tacos with the small corn shells, and with flavor combinations that venture into newer territory than your simple carnitas with cilantro and onions.  It's great.  And you know what's surprisingly great?  The salads!  They're huge, and the one I ordered the last time that I went was perfectly dressed.  It's a fun place to go with a big group, especially if you're the type to enjoy big booths that sit high off the floor, which I do...until it's time to slide out of them after a margarita pitcher, but whatever.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. When I hear tacos. I hear tacos, which usually means blah! I've been to dozens of taco places.   It's always the same. Mediocre tortillas and over cooked meat and soggy vegetables. However, this place was completely different.   We opted for the all you can eat. So, we had a starter. Which was guacamole, cheese dip, salsa and green salsa. Everything was spectacular. The chips were cooked just right. The guacamole had huge chunks of avacodo in it. Everything was delicious. Second course was salad. We had the Asian salad. It was extremely tasty. The almonds and bacon, along with the dressing was all the perfect blend.   Moving in to our tacos. There isn't much to say except, they didn't last long. The fish taco wasn't my favorite. However, I'm from HI, so I've been spoiled. But, the taco with the pineapple and the vegetarian taco was divine!! So good, I asked for seconds.   I did order the sangria and my husband ordered the spicy, margarita. The drinks were incredibly tasty.   The service was superb. The restaurant and bathrooms were extremely clean. However, one negative about the bathrooms is, there's only one sink. Not, my ideal set up. All in all it was an awesome evening. I'll definitely be back and I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A stunning meal.  Fresh margaritas with chips n queso+chorizo.  A variety of tacos and pozole (loaded with chicken and beef shortrib).  Friendly service and a nice atmosphere.  Update:  We went back last week and the experience was the same.  Friendly staff and fresh food made with care.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our server Michael was amazing!! He was so personable, quick and made us feel very welcomed! He is the reason I want to come back more!!"}
{"text":"Food just isn't very good  queso has a mashed potato texture and actually tastes like baked potato soup. Just not good for the price. Sangria is very good though!"}
{"text":"My wife is the one who suggested it and I do not get very excited for new places. When I saw the menu I didn't think there would be anything I would like. I actually had three of their tacos which were pretty awesome. My favorite one was the \"weird c word\" (can't remember the name) which I highly recommend if you like spicy food. My PBR came in a boot which was pretty awesome. It was a cool atmosphere and the interior was pretty killer. I will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey. What more could a girl ask for?!  I have tried several items on multiple visits. You can't do wrong by starting with the chips and guacamole. The Willie Ensalata is a generous portion of salad topped with an assortment of fresh meats and veggies. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the papas tostado was. A vegetarian option which I highly recommend. As far as tacos go, I can say that any of the following would be a good pick for this spot: FISH, BAJA SHRIMP, Pollo ROJO or EL PASTOR. All were served in a handmade tortilla with fresh ingredients.   I have enjoyed the Paloma which is grapefruit cocktail, the Bakersfield margarita and also the Spicy Margarita. The last one does pack a punch so beware anyone who doesn't like spice, this one will get you!"}
{"text":"Visited here mid day for some drinks and a small lunch. Amazing food and really nice atmosphere. Ordered just a beer because I couldn't make up my mind on what drink I wanted. I ordered two of the fish tacos and WOW so good! I normally wouldn't eat crispy fish but it was soooo good! My boyfriend got the chorizo chili and he liked it a lot but it was spicy   Would visit again! Very pleased   Oh and the guacamole!!!! The bomb!"}
{"text":"I went to Bakersfield for lunch and it was inventive and decent, but not OMG AMAZING. The queso and chips were pretty yummy (the top looks like a personal pan pizza with all that delicious bubbly cheese) and the short rib torta was okay. I felt a little silly, but since there was RIB in the name, I wasn't sure if there would be bones in the sandwich; there weren't, woohoo hahah. I was so stuffed that I couldn't eat the other half of my sandwich.  Parking, like everyone says, is a pain, even when the restaurant is empty (like it was today) because Bakersfield customers are prohibited from parking in the main parking deck next door. We ended up finding street parking."}
{"text":"Awesome joint with a great outdoor area in the tremont area!   We all had some version of the short ribs and it was amazing.    The music is a nice pandora like station.  Not sure about the tequila or whiskey as we went for lunch   Def will come again!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food is fresh but kind of bland. Margaritas are always good. Service has never been disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday about 3ish.   Our server was friendly but not very attentive. Gave us our appetizer of chips gauc, salsas, and cheese within plates/napkins.   Never walked by to ask her for any.  Then a guy, I don't think was a server, maybe worked kitchen, came out with our tacos.  Set up the tray and told us which tacos are which.   Then turned to walk away so fast, wehad to yell, ' can we have some plates, silverware & napkins?'   He said nothing and kept walking so we said, 'excuse me' a bit louder, and he half turned and yelled back, 'I'm getting them!'  Yeeeaaahhhh, a tad bit awkward and unfriendly was the impression.  On to food.  The best thing we ate was the guacamole.  It's probably the best I've had from any restaurant in cle. However, the chips can be salty, so be aware.   We added chorizo to the queso cheese dip since other reviews suggested to do so.  But no.  We did not care for the cheese dip at all.  The top part of cheese is like a melty/stretchy cheese like a mozzarella, but the cheese under that was chalky and not overly tasty.  The chorizo didn't even have a kick to it.  We abandoned half of it. The tacos are smallish.  None of us liked the housemade tortillas they came on.   So we just ate the filling with a fork.  The fillings were ok.  We had one of each of them.  None stood out and made me want more.  Ingredients seem fresh and quality seems good tho.     I had ice tea and that was fine.  My hubby got the Bakersfield sour and the drink was very good, but the 2 \"bourbon soaked cherries\" that are supposed to come with it were disgusting !  First of all my hubby said they didn't taste like they were soaked in any bourbon, and second, he made the worst face after putting the 1st one in his mouth!   He said it tasted so bad!   In the end, we agreed we'd come back for guacamole and a drink.  So about a month after posting my review here, I got a message from a \"Brody\" responding to it.  He called me a \"twat\" because I mentioned how awful the cherries were and that they are luxardo cherries.  Told me that my hubby and I don't know anything and we should stay in the suburbs!   Well \"Brody\", we actually do purchase luxardo cherries and know exactly what they look and taste like and those were NOT luxardo.  Also, the fact this person was so nasty and upset about my cherry comment makes me wonder if it's the owner, manager, or the bartender himself that responded.  No one else would care!  I took a screen shot of his message and posted it in pics."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is the best taco joint in the city. Most importantly, they are open for lunch. Who doesn't NEED tacos for lunch?  The staff are super friendly and adorable. Seriously everyone there was great! From the super attentive waitstaff to the owners that sometimes will walk around and tell the Bakersfield story (Ask- get cultured on Bakersfield,CA culture!) everyone seems to like their job.   I have been here so many times and I have one suggestion that you shouldn't pass up. Whether it's lunch or dinner or late night you have to try their margarita! They have 2 versions, the premium made with top shelf vodka or the Bakersfield. Whatever you choose doesn't matter because the key to the amazing margs is that they have magic elves juicing fresh limes in the basement. Nothing else can explain why I've become completely obsessed.  I don't even need to mention the tacos. Just remember that 2 tacos are a perfect portion and don't forget the quac."}
{"text":"What a great place!!  Thanks Yelp. I am from Bakersfield--wouldn't give me discount ha ha ha.  but other than that great food--fast service and friendly people.  So worth it.  Don't miss the guacamole!!!  Green salsa is great!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Cleveland. Great prices. Everything made in house. Margaritas are dangerously delicious. 2 Pineapple Margaritas, guacamole and a few short rib tacos will set you right."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch and it was a really cool place with friendly staff and roll up glass garage doors opened to East Blvd, nice atmosphere, good chips and salsa.  Unfortunatley it was nowhere near the BEST fish tacos in Charlotte like someone had  told me.   My  $4.00 Mahi taco only had a single finger sized piece of deep fried Mahi, raw corn tortilla, and  just tasted ok.    I'm sure it would be a fun place to get a drink and watch a game.  Cabo Fish tacos still has the best by far in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time yesterday. Love this place! Very rustic and cool.. The queso and chips are AMAZING. Loved the combinations of tacos you can try. They are only $4!   Service was excellent and the manager very engaging with the customers.  There is also a huge bar downstairs! Very fun crowd.  We sat by the large windows that were open b/c it was nice out.  Feels like you're sitting completely outside!   I suggest trying this new place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience as usual! Our server Jason was awesome, so nice and fast! I will be back!"}
{"text":"What started as a difficult decision on where to eat tacos ended in a perfect dinner at Bakersfield. This was my first experience eating here and I left quite impressed. My gut was telling me \"Sabor\" but I also wanted to try something new and since it was suggested by my girlfriend I obliged.  $4 tacos across the board-not sure if this is the typical pricing or if they were on special. The taco fillings were delicious, especially the fish and shrimp. They came in corn tortillas, which I love, just not soft. This was my mistake as I should have asked the waiter to make sure they were crispy. Unfortunately with the taco ingredients it made for a soggy shell. Nonetheless the tacos were still very good.  If you are a fan of corn tortillas, take the time to ask for them to be crispy and you will thank yourself after. I liked the high booths and circular pub table that we were seated at. The lighting is not too bright and creates a nice ambiance in the restaurant. It was a bit loud here for a Tuesday night and they could have benefitted from turning down the volume just a bit. Overall I was very pleased with this place!"}
{"text":"New place that opened up in Ohio City. My friend and I heard they were open for lunch so we stopped by at 2pm. Unfortunately, after inadvertently walking into an employee meeting, we found out that lunch hours would not be in effect until this Friday, 4/7. However, the manager Lauren told us to come back for a free drink when they opened at 4pm.  After a couple beers at Great Lakes to bride the gap until 4pm, we headed on back to Bakersfield and grabbed seats at the bar. The interior is clean and has a woodsy feel with the bar starring front and center of the layout. They had 6 beer drafts on tap including some unique ones like Rhinegeist Hustle and Stone Ripper. I ordered the former and followed it up with a Pineapple margarita. To soak up the alcohol, I ordered an array of their tacos - steak, short rib, chicken and pork. The tacos were delicious (could probably eat 10+ in one sitting) and there was an unexpected star of the show amongst the sea of meats. Fresh house-made corn tortillas. These tacos, anchored by the vessel of the house made tortilla, were super flavorful and will be good competition for Barrio.  If the great food and margaritas weren't enough, Lauren the manager reduced our bill by 90% to account for the inconvenience earlier in the day. Now that's customer service. Awesome experience. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great finger food options for lunch, Maggie the manager made my first, but not last, visit exceptional. Treated me like a VIP!!"}
{"text":"The chips and gauc deserves 5 stars, it was that good!  Guac was limey and flavorful just how I like it.  The service was something to be desired...took a while to get our order and drinks/refills.    I asked for suggestions on the tacos and the waitress suggested the bistec taco.  I asked if the steak was cooked through (I'm picky about how my meat is cooked) and she said yes.  I didn't want any pink in the steak and when the taco arrived and I took my first bite, all of it was chewy.  I took out the meat and cut them in half to find every single piece bright red.  If you're not a fan of medium rare steak, than I'd pass on this item.  I also went with the portobello taco and it was decent, flavorful.  In addition to the chips and gauc, we got the chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa came with a green and red salsa.  The green salsa was delicious and the red salsa had a spicy kick to it!  It was also good but had a sweetness that I didn't care for as much.    I'd like to go back and try some of their other tacos."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is on trend, but their margaritas are the worst. Tried the Bakersfield Margarita, really didn't like how sour and tart it tasted. But I of course drank it cause it's alcohol and didn't want to send it back. Tried another margarita this time with gold tequila hoping it would be closer to what I typically like, and it also was no good, very very tart and just did not taste like a margarita at all. The sever was nice and said they use fresh lime juice and that could be why, but whatever the reason, I will not be trying any of their margaritas anytime soon."}
{"text":"I can't pass up a taco so I was really excited to finally try Bakersfield. Two friends and I went there and really enjoyed it.  If the weather is nice, sit on the patio. Bonus: It's dog friendly!  We started with the pineapple margaritas - do yourself a favor and get a pitcher like we did. They are excellent ~ strong and not too sweet. Next up was guac and chips and queso and chips. The queso is an unusual but tasty blend of cheeses and is served in a mini cast iron skillet which helps it stay hot.  I ordered two tacos:  HUITLACOCHE and AL PASTOR. The tortillas were flavorful. For fillings, the Al Pastor was the clear winner. The Huitlacoche was mostly corn and the actual corn smut consisted of a few tiny pieces. Both were tiny and could have used an extra scoop or two of filling.   There were 3 sauces on the table ~ make sure you don't overlook these because there were awesome!  Overall the food and drinks were great, albeit a tad too expensive. The price of the tacos could easily be dropped by a dollar. But my biggest pet peeve is that there are no complimentary chips and salsa. For real.   Also, if you can't find street parking, there is a lot adjacent to the patio that charges $5."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant in Dilworth!  I went there last night with a friend and after being open less than a week, the place was packed!  We were greeted immediately by the owner who gave us a description of the cocktails...he recommended the Bakersfield margarita and I'll probably never have anything else there...yummy!  The atmosphere is vibrant and casual with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I think this is going to be my new go-to spot in Dilworth for cocktails, good food and hanging with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! In town for a conference and walked into the first place we saw. So glad it was Bakersfield. I had the fish and shrimp tacos, incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly. Spicy without overwhelming the rest of the flavors. Our server Tyler was wondering, helpful when I spilled a taco, gave fantastic and honest recommendations and was upbeat and friendly the entire time. 5 stars for service and food! Also amazing margaritas. You know the food and server are fantastic when the margs get spoken about last."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe to it. So it fits in the with the south end. Young good looking staff.   Now for the food. Most, if not all items are \"a la carte\". My family is currently obsessed with tacos \"al pastor\". The tacos are $3 each and 3 filled up my 18 year old son. Not cheap, but what is anymore! I had a bite, and I thought they were good, not great. The bits of pineapple were a nice touch. I had a short rib torta, which I thought was delicious. The margaritas were nice and strong. All in all, if you want some descent California style Mexican food and are leery of going into an authentic taqueria because of the language barrier, try Bakersfield east."}
{"text":"Ah I loved my food here! Cool atmosphere also, seems like a fun place to come with friends for drinks. The taco I had was small and incredibly tasty. I also got a salad (can't remember the name of it) that I would get a thousand times over."}
{"text":"Walked in. Couldn't hear the hostess because it was so loud. Walked out. Just another downtown place where people go to be seen, rather than to enjoy a nice meal. Owners should invest in some sound absorption. There are many options available for restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is okay but the atmosphere is congested!! I can't relax at this place to much going on. Music is way to loud!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and a wonderful selection of whiskey. The chicken, steak, and short rib ones are the best tacos. The fish taco is a solid option too."}
{"text":"Simply the best taco joint you'll find! Outstanding variety of tacos, great tequila & whiskey selections and tasty margaritas. Very fresh ingredients like house-made guac daily, as well as their own from-scratch tortillas. The verde salsa is also fantastic. The bar and server staff is outstanding and really aim to please.  Everyone goes away happy!    Check it out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield once before on a busy Saturday night with a large group. Service was terrible but I thought the food was decent enough to try again. Maybe it was just a fluke the first time.   This time I came with just a friend and we were seated at a communal table with other people we didn't know. Awkward!   I started with the spiced apple margarita and it was great! We also got chips and guacamole and salsa. The verde salsa is the best. The rojo salsa tastes like smoked peppers and was sweet. I wasn't a fan.   For tacos I got the bistec and short rib. Both great but their tacos are super small!   It was a slower day this time and service was a lot better."}
{"text":"This place is everything I've heard it is! Some wonderful quick service, fast food and super flavorful!"}
{"text":"Not much food on the menu but prices aren't bad. this place is a whiskey and tequila joint so I was expecting them to be able to mix it up but it was disappointing. I asked for some common drinks such as Midori Sour, Irish redhead, seven and seven. None was available. Really disappointed with that. I waited about 10 minutes for my waitress to come back around just so I can order the drink. But the chips and quest was delicious. Margaritas are great also. Altogether a great food place but I expected better since under the name it says tacos, tequila and whiskey. That's why I have a 3."}
{"text":"Might be the most unique and delicious selection of tacos I have ever had. We tried all of the different types of tacos and we were impressed with all of them. The service was amazing and the margaritas were top notch. All of the ingredients are fresh squeezed and house made! I will most definitely be back and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and I wish I could remember the bartender's name because she was awesome... i want to say it was Kelsey. Guacamole was really great and the tacos were good too. The margaritas are good...not sure if they are $9 each good...but they have tequila on special a few nights a week, so just go on one of those nights if you looking for a more affordable version. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Chips, cheese(you could slather anything on), salsa & guac $10...yum, Great Margharitas..fabulous open-air concept...hubs had some street tacos, I had the \"quesidillia\" ...too bad I cant spell that"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, really. I saw it pop up one night when we had just gotten out of a show and we were searching for somewhere downtown that was still open. Since my visiting friend and I used to live in Bakersfield, we kinda joked that it would be funny to hit it up, and since we hadn't had enough time before the show to grab food, all three of us (me, husband, friend) were kind of on the ravenous side. The Yelp reviews sounded really positive too, although we're always extremely skeptical of Mexican food places in Pittsburgh; me having lived in a combo of SoCal and Bakersfield for decades and my friend having been born half-Mexican in Texas, on top of that.   Cute rustic decor, noise level was a little loud for my preference but seems about standard for a bar/food type place. I felt like the food quality was pretty good, but the flavors were a mixed bag. The queso was okay-ish but not great (we ordered it with the jalapeños added in, which was a nice kick). My favorite thing was the pork belly taco and I'd conceivably get it again if I ended up there, but my friend stopped eating halfway through his food because it was too bland, even with the added sauce, and my husband disliked his food so much that the previously-mentioned idea of \"again if I ended up there\" would pretty much not include him, as he was uninterested in going back (they also forgot to give him the margarita he ordered, which was irritating). Remember that we got there REALLY hungry, too, which should have encouraged more meal finishing.   I enjoy hipster tacos as much as the next foodie, but I think I will stick to Smoke for the hipster flavors and Las Palmas for the authentic ones. I agree with other reviews that the green salsa has the better flavor, however despite other assertions that calling a restaurant \"Bakersfield\" doesn't evoke a sense of real Mexican food, for someone who lived in Bakersfield this just doesn't fly with me. You don't want to be judged on being a Mexican joint, name yourself New York City. Bakersfield is full of Mexicans (hi Central Valley farm country!) and great, super-flavorful Mexican food. This wasn't it. :/"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with a fairly small menu.  The tacos are very good, but really kind of small.  Really, just another fancy place with decent food and drinks for people to try.  The queso fundido looked better in pics I had seen beforehand.  It was a slightly different version than I'm used to.  Don't know if they use different cheeses.  The pineapple margarita was good but could've been better for a $10 drink. The short rib taco and the salsa is about the only thing I would go back for & not on a busy Saturday."}
{"text":"Might be the best tacos I've ever had, and that says a lot since I grew up on the west coast and have had easy access to all the best taco trucks and joints on the CA coast, Seattle, etc. I got the pork pineapple tacos per my waiters recommendation. Great choice. Cool atmosphere, inexpensive, good service."}
{"text":"Went here during happy hour the week it opened. Ordered two tacos, pork belly and short rib. I didn't care for the flavor of the short rib one so I didn't finish it and the pork belly was hard indicating that it was overcooked. Mixed drinks were good, but a bit pricey. When the bartender noticed I hadn't eaten the tacos she did ask how I liked them. Then Beans came over to ask about the food, apologized that it was not up their or my standard and asked what they could do for me at the point in order for me to have a great experience. I declined any more food, but Beans insisted that I not be charged for food I didn't like and it was removed from my bill. I would revisit to give them another try after they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Been to Bakersfield on numerous occasions and it's a solid go-to for consistently solid tacos, chips and salsa and tequila drinks. They aren't super complicated with their menu but the atmosphere is great during the day or evening"}
{"text":"We saw the reviews and photos for this place so we decided to give it a try for dinner. There's valet parkig right next to it or you can try to find parking on the street. This place definitely gives off a hipster vibe. It was packed so be prepared to be on the wait list. Drinks aren't really on special and prices for dinner cost way more than the portion they give you. I'll come back to drink of out the boot glass but food wise I'm good, thanks."}
{"text":"Guacamole was excellent. Lots of lime juice for a tang, which I like. Got the el pastor (ok, a little bland) fish taco (excellent, big piece of fish cooked well and toppings provided nice flavor boost) and the short rib (very nice, juicy, well seasoned). No booze had to drive :-("}
{"text":"I've only ever gone here for drinks, but I've always had a good time when I did. Their margaritas are pretty good, and the place gets crowded but it's still not too difficult to hear the people that you're with. The drinks aren't the cheapest, but they're around the same price you'd pay for drinks at most other bars in the area. They have a great selection of tequila as well if you're into that. Only tip food-wise I can give is their tacos are pretty small, so my friends who've ordered them suggested getting at least 3 if you're wanting a decent meal."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent whiskey list, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is forever one of my favorite taco joints! I've been to the location in Cincinnati in the past, Happy to see the quality and flavors are consistent across the locations! Stopped in on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend for lunch, we were promptly seated on the airy patio!   We started off with the chips and guacamole, and a pineapple margarita for me! Guacamole was very delicious and perfect salty delicious chips !   I ordered the chicken tostada, it was heavenly! Just a little spicy but the buttermilk dressing complimented it well! Boyfriend ordered 3 tacos: Fish, Carnitas, Braised Pork. He said all were amazing!   5. If we are ever back in Cleveland we will return to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Great food. Fun atmosphere. Delicious strong Margs. Shot specials. And very affordable. Super impressed."}
{"text":"I first visited Bakersfield with a group of eight people on a Wednesday. I was worried about seating so we arrived early, about 4:20pm. Many of the small tables were already occupied, but all four large picnic bench style tables towards the front were free. We ordered a few baskets of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Both salsas (a sweet, smoky red salsa and a creamy cilantro salsa) were huge hits with everyone. I ordered the bistec and short rib tacos which were both delicious, but the bistec taco, with super tender meat and chipotle slaw, is what will keep me coming back to Bakersfield.  My second visit was with five people on a Saturday evening before a Pirates game. We were immediately seated downstairs in a big, comfy booth. This time I ordered the Willie salad, which is like a taco salad with a lime vinaigrette. It was SO good!  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the margaritas are extremely sweet. Each time I have gone to Bakersfield, I've ordered two margaritas. And both times I've had a stomach ache afterwards. By now I have learned my lesson and will try something else next time.  Overall, I was very satisfied with both my visits to Bakersfield. The Downtown options for a moderately priced dinner with a big group are pretty slim, so I'm sure I'll be back to hang out soon."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic! Everything we've had has been indescribably delicious from food (tacos, tortas, salads, queso, guac, chips) to drinks (they're not stingy with the booze either!).  It's also a really pretty space with brick and wood, and they play Westerners on tv lol!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 if I could.  It's not \"must go!\", but if friends suggested it I wouldn't be upset.  It's that perfect - \"I want some good food and drink but it doesn't have to be a transcendent food experience\" kind of place"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It was my first time and I wasn't disappointed. I and my girlfriend had craving for a Mexican food, so we decided to try this place. Although the place was empty, the waitress was super nice and accommodating. She gave great suggestions on the order and made something extra for my girlfriend.  I definitely would like to come back here. It would be interesting to visit this place during the busy hours.  Ps. I loved their corn bisque soup! Try it."}
{"text":"Great food. Service can be better. Our table could fit 8 but we were only 3 so half was for is and half for another group. The queso dip was amazing. It came out nice and hot and the chips were good too. The chicken chorizo was delish, especially with the lime juice.   Due to the rush from the pirates win and the first nice spring day the place was crowded. We were given a couple different servers and had to wait on waters and the bill. Overall very good with some patience. Can't wait to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best tacos in Pittsburgh. Look no further. This place is beyond amazing. I especially love it because they are very gluten free friendly. The bistec taco is to die for. It's hands down the best taco I have ever had. For all you gluten free folks out there the only tacos that you cannot have are the fish and mole. So 7 out of 9 tacos are gluten free! The atmosphere is great although it can get very loud downstairs at night but that's to be expected. The margaritas are excellent as well."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh to see a friend, and looked on yelp to find some good restaurants. I chose to dine at this restaurant because of the great reviews. I was surprised to see that it was a mexican restaurant, because bakersfield does not sound mexican at all... We rode a taxi service to this restaurant, and it was a bit difficult to spot because there was construction going on right in front of the restaurant.   My first impression of the restaurant when I walked in: \"Wow, this place is empty.\" We weren't greeted immediately, so that was weird since the restaurant didn't have a lot of people. There a few people dining in, and some people at the bar. Our waitress was nice, but the rest of the workers in the restaurant seemed like they didn't want to be there.   My friend ordered a salad with chicken (Willie), which she said was really good. We also ordered cheese and tortilla chips, which were interesting. The cheese was mixed with two cheeses, one of the cheeses had a grainy texture, which I was surprised by. It tasted alright, but I didn't really like the texture of the grainy cheese. Loved how the cheese was really hot though. Anyway, I ordered a fish and bistec taco. The bistec taco was alright, tasted fine. I loved that the fish in my taco was pretty big in size, and tasted pretty great until I saw it was really undercooked. I told my waitress, and she came back with a new fish taco that wasn't as big, but was fully cooked. Would I come back if I visited Pittsburgh again? Not likely, but we'll see.."}
{"text":"Food is good! Never had any of the drinks hit I heard it was good! I love the house made tortillas and they have this dip that is so delicious!"}
{"text":"The QUESO was DELICIOUS, but I do not think I would order the tacos again. The short rib tostada was also delicious! While the tacos were pretty to look at, they were not nearly as delicious as I'd imagine them to be. I think the tacos are overhyped.   The service was average, if not below average. My server did not seem to care we were there, filled my boyfriend's water once the whole evening even though it was empty after the first 5 minutes, and did not clean up any of the empty dishes when they were clearly in the way of our eating other dishes.   Overall, a good experience, but the long wait times and mediocre taste of food were not worth another visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a bad experience at a taco festival that was being held the same day. Since we wanted tacos after the festival we decided to try this place out. The food was really good. The service wasn't. The waitress didn't seem interested in waiting on us. I did email the management the next day and they promised to send me out a gift card to come try them again. The gift card took a while to get here but I will try them again to see if the service has improved. Without that gift card we wouldn't have went back."}
{"text":"If I used one word to describe this place it would be fresh!  Loved everything!  Cool vibe in there and would be nice in the spring with the garage doors open.  The jalapeno margarita was super tasty!  We tried multiple different tacos and there were all delicious.  I loved all of the different flavor combinations.  We love a great guacamole and they did not disappoint!  It's easy to see why this is a popular place.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"In for a business meeting and found this place based on Yelp reviews. The hotel staff confirmation of this as the place to go for great tacos was quickly validated. The tacos and chili were amazing. However, our bartender, entertainer,server, and general food counsel Daryl really set the standard for what a bartender should live up to. Daryl lead us through a food and drink journey that far exceeded expectations. Anyone coming to the area should visit Bakersfield, head straight to the bar and find Daryl. He will make sure you have a good time, good food, and good drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible drinks and tacos!  I went there twice in 4 days because it was so good.  I recommend ANY of the tacos.  Seriously, I tried Pork Belly, Fish, Mole, Pollo, and short rib.  All fantastic.  Also, if you like bourbon or tequila, you won't find a better selection in the city."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally was able to come here for dinner.  My book club (a group of 7) met for dinner.  We were seated at a nice large table in the back of the room, near the bar, and received fantastic service.  We were here on a Tuesday evening, and while it was a weeknight, the restaurant was mostly full!  One of the members of our club had been here several times and convinced us to order the family style meal.  For only $15 a person we were treated to a very large order of chips and salsa, queso and guacamole!  The Queso was the star, it had ground beef and some nice jalapenos and red peppers on top.    Second course was two HUGE salads that were so delicious I would come back just for this salad.  Fantastic portion served with chunks of avocado and bacon and a delicious dressing.    Final course was a variety of four different tacos.  We each had two (remember there were seven of us) and there were a couple left over.  Options included pork, fish, vegetarian and beef.  The vegetarian was quite spicy but featured delicious chunks of mushrooms.   I will definitely be back and would encourage anyone that has a group over six people to order family style. The value is perfect but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews from my girlfriend after she visited Bakersfield in Nashville, and we were so excited to learn that Bakersfield opened their sixth location in Pittsburgh! We made Bakersfield our third bar stop during a recent joint birthday party celebration. We headed straight down to the basement which was the perfect place for our large group to hang out, drink, and eat appetizers in a trendy yet cozy environment. I ordered a Red Wine Sangria, which was very tasty and particularly potent for sangria. Then, I just had to try the legendary Chips and Queso. I wish that I knew exactly how they make this magical dish. The chips are crispy and homemade, while the queso was gooey and stretchy.... yummmmmm. I cannot wait to return here sometime soon and try some additional items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Very unique and cool environment. Great design.   Definitely try the queso.  Baja shrimp and steak tacos.   The service is the best. My sister in law is very 'particular' about what she eats. They staff did an amazing job to make the experience perfect.   I believe the managers name is Sarah. She was extremely helpful. Waitress was great also."}
{"text":"So I'm a fine dining server here in Cleveland and I've always hated yelp and opentable but after my restaurant earned best overall in several categories I decided my opinion mattered: hence my first review: Cylie was amazing and the tacos were tacos let's be honest who makes tacos better than Taco Bell? I'll wait lmao! But seriously tacos are tough, I like and love the decor and I will say this place has old western new age hipster class! If you'd like to hear more or receive my gift of service you can request me at Dante in tremont!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is just ok. Every time I have been in there it always takes forever for someone greet me or even drop a menu. My favorite taco is hands down the huitlacoche, the combo of flavors is amazing!! The atmosphere is awesome and so is the décor. Would recommend but be aware that you may wait a while."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is super friendly and accommodating, they have a large gluten free menu and the tacos are so good!  I love the pollo verde and spicy marg. This is one of my favorites in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"no gringo tacos here.   Best food best service best drinks  No new country here lots of great music Johnny Cash Dwight Yoakum a few rock classics thrown in"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Bakersfield - especially after I had heard positive things from friends of mine. Both times I went there, the service was SLOW. We had to ask for everything....napkins, silverware, water, straws, salt and pepper, plates. It got to the point where I thought I was going to have to get up and make the meal myself. The lunch menu is very limited and the food was ok but nothing to rave about. I would take Condado over this place any day."}
{"text":"Wait, Bakersfield is a chain? Wow, I had no idea until I browsed some of these reviews just now. Crazy. It definitely doesn't have a chainy vibe...it feels like a local, hip, modern Pittsburgh joint.   We recently came here with some friends on a Saturday night. We got there rather early...just shy of 6:00....and we were able to get a table with relative ease. As the evening went on though, it grew more and more crowded, so be prepared to wait for a table if you come during prime dinner hours. As I mentioned, the vibe of this place is very trendy, but not in an unwelcoming or intimidating way.   First, the booze. Get the margarita! I don't always love margaritas...sometimes they're too sour, sometimes they're sickeningly sweet, sometimes they taste like nothing but tequila. The Bakersfield margarita was my goldilocks margarita...perfect balance of everything. And strong too, so at $8, it was a good value.  Next, the food. To start, we got chips and guac and chips and queso. I'm not a guac eater, but the rest of my dining companions reported that it was some of the most fresh, tasty guacamole they've ever had. So thumbs up for the guac. As for the queso, you can add goodies to it if you're so inclined (black beans, chorizo, etc.), but we opted to order it plain. It had amazing flavor, but it was definitely different from typical queso served at Mexican restaurants. It had a somewhat pasty, grainy texture...kinda similar to hummus. My friend said the texture reminded him of a thick bisque. So queso purists might be turned off by the unusual texture, but it was delicious regardless....I mean, let's be real, it's a bowl of hot cheese, so how could it *not* be delicious?   As for the tacos, they received high marks from our group as well. I sampled the pollo rojo and huitlacoche. The pollo rojo was divine...the chicken, spicy salsa, chipotle lime crema, and cilantro all combined for one hell of a delicious bite. I was less of a fan of the huitlacoche...it tasted a bit too grassy for my liking (I guess the technical foodie term would be \"earthy,\" but I still maintain that it tasted kinda like grass :) As for my friends, the hands down favorites for them were the fish taco and the bistec taco (made with short rib, slaw, cilantro). Note that the tacos here are kinda small....usually at any taco joint, two tacos is more than enough to fill me up, particularly if there are appetizers involved. But even with having chips and guac/queso and then two tacos each, everyone at my table ended up ordering a third taco after.   Our server was Dylan and he was fun, friendly, and attentive. Our food came out fast. Overall, it was a great night out and I think this will become one of our dining staples when we're downtown. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my girlfriends birthday and had the best time! Dani was spot on and the tacos were great. We've been coming to Bakersfield for a while and will keep making this our favorite taco spot in the city!"}
{"text":"A recent visit to Bakersfield reinforced why this is one of the best Tex-Mex joints in Charlotte, but a couple of drawbacks knocked it back from my original five-star rating. First off, this place is LOUD. And while the vibrant, lively atmosphere makes it one of the hippest restaurants in the Queen City, it's also extremely hard to carry on a conversation. Whether you're at the bar or a table, the cacophony is near-deafening, so be prepared to do a fair amount of screaming over your dinner.   Second, the margaritas we had during this last visit were less compelling than I remember, with more tart than tequila. But the meal -- from the chips & queso we started with, to the Pollo Rojo and Bistec tacos I enjoyed for my entree -- was outstanding. I'd still rate Bakersfield as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but you may want to learn lip-reading if you plan to visit on a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is ok for what it is. I purchased the fish tacos and they were super small and not very tasty. Only go here if you're feeling adventurous or you like spicy alcohol.. Yuck."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for the soft-opening before the restaurant was open to the public. The atmosphere inside was a huge change from Longboards, which operated in the space not too long ago.   Inside is now wood grain floors and comfy dark leather booths. The booths are shaped in a semicircle which make the space feel more open than the standard square booths that most restaurants have. On the walls they have TVs playing Clint Eastwood western movies. And above the bar is a nice selection of Tequila bottles.  I ended up trying multiple tacos, with my favorite being the short rib. They make the tortillas in house, and you can taste it in how fresh the tortillas are. I also enjoyed the chicken mole taco which had delicious pickled red onions on top. The tacos are slightly on the small side, but they sure are good.  The staff was friendly and very helpful in giving me suggestions for tequila to sip on. Overall, I was impressed with the food and service and look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 11 and I made a booking, which would highly recommend as it got busy. So there were some misses with this place for me, service and ambiance wise, which is why it's not a full 5-stars. Our server messed up some orders, drinks were a looong time coming (and some didn't come at all until our server was reminded again and again!)  For drinks, I got the House Sangria. It was actually quite good, but I wanted more fruit and especially more pieces of the baby mandarin in my drink. I also took a sip of the spicy margarita that a co-diner order and gosh dang it - that was way too spicy for me as it incorporated freshly chopped jalapeño!! You have been warned!!!!   I also ordered an entree of corn chips and salsa - asked for the red sauce (thanks to Yelper Bradford M for that tip). When it came out, it had the green salsa which I definitely did not like as it had a weird aftertaste. I also didn't really enjoy the red one which was too smoky for my palate. Both the salsas had a sort of heavy bitterness which turned me off.   However the saving grace from an appetizer point of view was the Queso dip. Now I will admit that I did not want to order this dip because seeing the yelp pictures it felt like it was going to be that fake plastic cheese that you seem to get  in most American restaurants, so I was pleasantly surprised by this Queso dip which was fresh and bursting with a great medley of flavors. I would absolutely recommend getting this for an appetizer.  For my taco variety, I decided to get the following: -Pork belly pastor: this is the one I was most excited to try but the fact that the pork belly was cut up into small pieces meant that some pieces had too much fat and some pieces had too much chewy belly. I also wasn't of a huge fan of the seasoning. Ranked #2 for me.  - Cochinita pibil: absolutely my favorite of the night and I almost didn't get its as it was an afterthought! That achiote braised pork was AMAZING!! Spicy taste, tender pork, perfect medley of flavours. Ranked #1 for me.  - Hongos: I love me some mushrooms and the thought of them in a taco I thought would be perfect. However this turned out to be a major disappointment. Similar to the pork belly, the portobello mushroom was chopped up into small pieces which made it difficult to eat and pieces of the mushroom kept falling onto my plate. I also thought the variety of mushroom used with the corn tortilla were just not compatible and in the end, I left the corn tortilla on my plate and just ate the portobello mushroom pieces with some chips. Ranked #3 for me.  Btw, a lot of my co-diners heavily praised the Short Rib Tostadas, but I didn't taste so can't comment. Also for a table of 11 that wanted to talk, the music was super loud and so conversations were mostly with folks sitting next to you. Frankly I'd only ever come here again if I didn't want to speak to my co-diners....   Note: #326 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016"}
{"text":"The tacos were okay-drinks were better. I would defiantly come back to get drinks and sit on the patio but that's about it. The queso dip was just okay nothing special and a little overpriced just like the tacos."}
{"text":"I got the Spicy Mahi and Shrimp tacos ($4 each) and enjoyed both.  Their chips and salsas ($3) were good, too.    Sis got the al pastor taco and didn't like it.  Typical Americanized Mexican food.   Friendly service, drunk patrons early Sunday lunch time for their $3 PBR and Modelo special, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tacos. We tried a bunch of them and all were delish. The pineapple margarita was killer - I thought it would be too sweet, but it was well-balanced. The guac is above average and the salsa is the style I like, kinda chunky and not too spicy.  The vibe is kinda urban and it it really fits with the rest of SoLo. It's also fairly busy so you might have to wait, but overall it's worth it. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"One star is being generous.  I get that this place gets busy but a 3 hour wait is absolutely ridiculous.  They need more seating.  Its a shame because the food is actually delicious, our waitress was nice but the manager not so much.  We were texted that our table was ready, told which table was ours, and sat there and watched it not be cleared for another 15 min after waiting 3 hours to be seated.  I complained to the manager, just asking when our table would be cleared, who then decided to give me an attitude, so needless to say this was our first and last trip to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield several times since my last review. On my last review, I mentioned that it was swelteringly hot inside on a regular day. They seem to be better regulating their temperature and the environment is far more comfortable.  I have to agree, the tacos here are good. They are different than Barrio, so don't go in with the mindset of expecting that or you'll just be disappointed. Bakersfield has house-made tortillas and is a bit more into spicier flavors and slaw and cabbage. My favorite tacos are the short rib and the crispy shrimp - the shrimp is big and juicy, and the cheese in both hits the spot. Bakersfield also recently got on UberEats, and they have an under 30 minute delivery time. My friend and I tried an assortment of tacos recently and they were just as good as in-person, colorful and fresh.  Oh, and Bakersfield also has some damn good margaritas. They make them STRONG! Try the pomegranate or ask about the special of the day. Be cautious at lunch though or you'll leave with a little buzz! Not that I would know or anything..."}
{"text":"Loved it! We started with drinks at the downstairs bar for the group while we waited for our table. A pitcher of spicy margaritas, and orders chips and guac / queso, later (only about 20 min), we got the front table which sat all 8 of us!  We got a variety of tacos and everyone was pleased! From the pollo rojo, the braised beef, and the fish taco, to the tequila, we were very pleased! I strongly suggest the chips and queso app, and go with your stomach on the tacos, because from what we saw -- you can't go wrong!  Cheers, Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Love the bar staff here! Also the papas are amazing. If you came when they first opened they changed the dish and it's sooo much better now. This is a good place if your not that hungry and are looking for \"upscale\" tacos... lol oh and Bacardi and Mexican Coke please"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was so awesome. How trendy? Def walk or take an uber.  How could I complain about a place that is so like modern but rustic - especially when they play Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash.  The food was excellent. Plenty of options. They had a great pineapple margarita that was refreshing. I would suggest getting the chips and cheese with the chorizo in it. Amen. You'll want reservations unless you're willing to sit at bar if it's just two people.   The only downside that cannot be controlled was the loud group of girls next to us talking about the MTV awards.....  Bartenders are hip."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 7PM and got seated at 8:15PM. What is the point of even having a reservation? Service was below average."}
{"text":"** Tasty tacos with various protein choices and drink options. Nice ambiance to complement the food for a great place to hang out and enjoy food with friends or family.   I was introduced to this place by my girlfriend who has been here a few times, and had a lot of good things to say about it, so one night I went with her and some of her friends to try it out. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the experience, so I think Bakersfield definitely made a good impression on me.  $4 tacos with all your traditional proteins like pork, beef, as well as fish, shrimp, and short rib. The taco sizes aren't huge, so I ordered four tacos, so just keep that in mind.   I also had the sangria, which was a bit stronger than I expected, but still tasty and went well with the food. The lighting was a little too dark in my opinion to see, and the high table with the sofa seating was a bit awkward since it felt like we were too low, but as a whole the ambiance is pretty nice since it gives you a relaxed vibe. Come check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time today. The guacamole and chips were amazing. The guacamole had big chunks of avocado in it with just the right amount of seasoning and onion. I ordered the Papas. It looked absolutely amazing when it came out, but fell short after that. It was a little too spicy for my taste. I also didn't care for the flavors. It was a little too citrusy. My husband got three tacos and said they were just ok, but he really enjoyed the chicken taco and the homemade shells.  They didn't have many vegetarian options.  Good service. I would give them another if I am in the area, but won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos in a great location makes this spot a worthy rival for Barrio. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is our go to place to start the weekend of right. Always great service, the chips and guac are perfect for starters. We have had every taco on the menu, all are exceptional, of course there is even a vegetarian taco for those people. :) Parking can be a bit tricky, if you do not valet, but look around and there is usually always parking close by. Perfect times to go if you are not wanted to be in the mainstream nightly crowd is between 4 - 6:30 pm. After 6:30 almost nightly they are packed and you should expect the noise level to be loud and the service to take just a little longer as they have a full house."}
{"text":"Perfect location! Short rib taco is super delicious! Ask for Matt W! He's extremely knowledgable about the menu and has a wonderful personality. I'll definitely go back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"They have by far some of the best queso I've ever had!!! The guacamole is out of this world as well!! I visited Bakersfield again this week for probably the fourth or fifth time over the past few months. Once again, I left very pleased with the whole experience - food, service, atmosphere. This visit we did notice that the music was very loud that it was almost hard for the 3 of us to have s conversation. I ordered the Milanesa sandwich and loved it! After filling up on queso and guac, I ended up bringing half of the sandwich home for lunch the next day. The guys I was with ordered 3 tacos each and nearly inhaled them so I'm guessing they were delicious as well. We will definitely be back again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place and everyone who I know and who eats with me when I am here is or becomes obsessed too! Since I've never had anything bad I'll just say my favorites : Chips and queso - you CANNOT leave Bakersfield without trying this, love the johnny salad, the mahi taco, and all the margaritas - if you'll have more than 1 and are with friends the best bang for your buck is to order a pitcher! The service is always excellant and the decor is super trendy. now i'm craving a margarita . . . ."}
{"text":"YUM! Great tacos, salsa and ambience. Will definitely be back for more delicious food. Good beer prices."}
{"text":"Met up with a group of 3 friends on a Thursday night. Service was slow, food was cold. We went nowhere else before, and went our separate ways immediately after our meal.36 hours later, all 4 of us have uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea, with fever and chills.Norovirus, caught from unsanitary conditions in the kitchen. Needless to say, none of us will be returning. A message to the manager has gone unreturned."}
{"text":"I drive past this restaurant all the time and have been wanting to try it since I moved to Charlotte back in August. When we arrived I was struck by the cool ambiance and awesome bar area, but was somewhat disappointed with my actual meal. The chips and salsa were delicious and a definite must. Be sure to load up on the salsa verde which was so fresh and flavorful. I wish I could say the same for the two tacos I ordered, however. Feeling surf and turf, I decided to order the fried shrimp and steak tacos. While the shrimp taco was just alright, the steak taco was fairly underwhelming. The meat was very chewy and bland. I was hoping for some kind of a fresh cilantro marinated or chimichurri type dressing but what I got was steak that'd been doused in some kind of BBQ sauce that didn't seem to go very well with the rest of the ingredients in the taco. Overall presentation of the dish was beautiful but sadly did not meet my expectations given the delicious apps and overall atmosphere. I'd be willing to give it another try, but maybe just for happy hour and apps."}
{"text":"Awesome bar and selection of Tequilas. Tacos were amazing and delicious. We will definately go back and try more of the menu. Staff was super friendly. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Wow what an incredible place for dinner! We were visiting Pittsburgh from out of town and can't wait to come back and go out to eat here again. Highly recommend ordering the queso and guacamole, I literally wanted to lick the dish they were so yummy.  And great selection of tacos to satisfy all taste buds and at a nice price of $4 can't go wrong. Our server Carisa (sorry if I spelt it wrong) was incredible. She had great recommendations, attentive, and was as sweet as could be."}
{"text":"I love this place it's super low key but modern with a nice whiskey  down south feel to it ! They also have all types of tequila whiskey's and Brandy's so great cocktails .. O.. and the menu F'n amazing!!! So bring ur boo or bae..check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"My first kiss was a blend of sweat and lip gloss. It may not seem like a good combo but trust me, it was.   That's what Bakersfield does.  They put together odd combos that work sooooo well.   Ingredients like radish, pineapple, kale, hearts of palm and corn truffles fill the menu.   Roll it up, take a bite, love.   Margaritas are hand pressed, tart and refreshing.  Super cool and casual environment with open air seating by the windows/garage doors makes this a fun experience.   Grab some friends and go."}
{"text":"After visiting Bakersfield in Columbus, OH I was pleased to find out that there was one here in Pittsburgh as well. After a morning of meetings I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to check it out. Street parking wasn't bad as I got there right at 11 when they were opening. Just know, all parking meters are in the same side of the street and through the week you will pay $4 for an hour.  I'll tell you now, it is totally worth it!  In Columbus I had Chips and Guacamole but this time I opted to get the Queso as I had been told it is the way to go. I can now confirm as a Guac Fiend...the Queso is way better at Bakersfield!!! It is truly something unique and special. Pair it with the milder Cilantro based Green Sauce or spicy Red Sauce and you will have a winning combo!  I still hold a grudge that chips aren't complimentary but I'll get over it someday.  Now I loved the Shrimp Taco last time I had it and once again, it is one of the very best Tacos I've ever had! The slaw and sauce along with large shrimp just can't be beat. And while I wasn't blown away with the Al Pastor on my previous visit, this time it was far superior. I just wish the Pastor had a bit more crispness to it.  Quiet honestly, these are the best Tacos I've found in Pittsburgh to date!  I also tried their special Chorizo Chili and suggest you do as well if it is on the menu. An excellent blend of sweet and spicy that is hearty and filling.  This location was I bit smaller and more compact than Columbus but didn't feel cramped. It was well staffed and everyone I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  Playing old westerns on the TVs was also a nice touch.  If you are a Taco fan and nearby, get here ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice decor. Only complaint the AC was not working last night and it was really hot.  I got the Margarita, wish they had a frozen one. My partner got the spicy one. Seriously the same drink but with jalapeño. The gauc was so good only complaint for 8 bucks more guacamole. Chips and salsa was good only thing salsa was so watery. We had basically all the tacos. Favorites mushrooms, fish, steak. The pork belly was over cooked. The chicken one was dry. I would come back to this place again tho."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Love their guacamole and queso. Their queso is really cheese and not the fake stuff. I love that they give fresh limes where is looks like they were just cut with their tacos. The Bistec taco is the best, very tender."}
{"text":"Great new place on Penn avenue! Our server \"beans\" was hilarious and explained the menu to us. The margaritas are so good! We also had the fish tacos and the short rib tacos. Both were fantastic! We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you're looking for a fun night out! We came last night and sat at the bar. We were greeted right away and offered an app, we chose the guacamole which is absolutely delicious. I've had guacamole from a lot of places but they definitely do it right. The tacos are great too! My favorite is the chicken mole served with pickled red onions. Another perk of this place is the $3 shot of the day! It doesn't take much to start your night off right!"}
{"text":"In town for a Pirates game and decided to try something different.  This place was pretty good.  The food was especially good.  Very authentic Mexican food truck type food.  Guacamole is a must.  I got the papas tostada and loved it.  My husband tried one of the many taco offerings and really enjoyed it as well.  While our waitress was extremely pleasant and helpful, she was often hard to find and charged our credit card the wrong amount, thus putting us in a position where we had to use another card due to the error as our real charge would then not go through.  Not exactly something I was thrilled with.   All in all, it wasn't bad and we'd definitely go back.  I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet night, families, or a romantic evening.  But it's good for food and fun."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. The queso dip is heavenly and the margaritas are wonderful. I got the bang bang shrimp taco, and the 2 vegetarian tacos (cant remember what theyre called)  all of them had so much flavor. All made with simple and fresh ingredients, they truly made me feel like i was sitting on a beach in Florida. Also the service was very attentive and outstanding."}
{"text":"Ooooo tacos in this place is amazing.  they just melt in your mouth.  Spicy Margaritas and Bloody Mary its my jam here. always packed and loud . it's a good thing)"}
{"text":"I love the tacos! They're fresh, full of flavor and a little different than your average taco place.   I love the freshly made margaritas! You can watch them being made right in front of you with fresh, REAL ingredients.   And, I'm pretty keen on the atmosphere. High-top tables compliment the high ceilings. Comfortable and clean.  Great service by the bar tender. She was attentive to us but yet left us to chitchat on our own.   FYI - I was here with my husband in the middle of the day on a weekday. It was a quite dining room and bar at first. Then the crowd picked up as it got to happy hour.  So my experience is based on a lunch time view. I'm sure the dinner time is much more crowded.   I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Charlotte - fresh squeezed and not too sweet - awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great tacos and ambiance. My girlfriend and I stopped in after visiting the West Side Market across the street and had a good time. Their drinks and food are really good. You won't be disappointed on dropping in for some food and drinks."}
{"text":"The guac and queso are definitely the standouts! The guac is limey and the queso is gooey in the most delicious of ways. The drinks and tacos are OK. They're not something I'd navigate parking for Downtown by themselves, but I would drive down just for the queso to be honest. The service has always been great when I've been in. Definitely an asset having another dining option Downtown."}
{"text":"My friends and I have embarked on the journey that is discovering the best tacos and margaritas in all of The Land. Bakersfield obviously made the list of contenders, so this is our breakdown:  Atmosphere: cool as shit. Small, but cozy with outdoor seating that boasts a solid view of the west side market and city skyline in the back.   Starters: they serve all 3 amigos: salsa, queso, and guac. (brownie points) costs extra for all 3....so no bottomless chips (minus brownie points) Queso was nothing to write home about.   Margs: available in pitchers (if you are ordering any other way, you're doing it wrong) feature seasonal flavors, like pineapple in the summer. super tasty. price could be better, but overall worth it.   Main event: multiple taco options, with interesting twists on your classics. We all felt the shells were especially floury/dry, which put a damper on the deliciousness on the inside. However, does come with fresh lime on the side to zest it up.   Overall experience: solid service, cool atmosphere, slightly above average tacos/margs. price could be a little better."}
{"text":"The reviews made us go here and it was just ok for us maybe slightly better than ok. The margaritas are not all that sorry to say but I admit I am very picky about my margarita. Can't stand any sweet sour mix. Guarro's in Austin makes the best!!!  Anyway we loved the crispy pork belly tacos although way too much pineapple but easy to remove. The fish taco was also excellent. The others we tried were ok. Salsa verde was great!  That's all we can report. I'd go back for a snack."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place for lunch and happy hour. They make a really good spicy margarita. They also have seasonal margaritas that are always worth trying. My company always chooses Bakersfield for happy hours and we get a selection of tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"Public service announcement! Awesome new restaurant on Penn that will NOT break the bank!   Knowing that this restaurant is a chain, I didn't have the highest hopes but was confident in my experience based on my fellow Yelper's reviews. I met two friends for a HH on a Monday around 4:45pm. We got there just in time because the placed filled by 6pm. Their special margarita flavor of the night was watermelon but they have a small assortment on their menu. Two of us ordered the spicy marg and one ordered the watermelon. Well, slap me silly and put a sombrero on my head- the spicy margaritas were top notch and hit the spot! And I've been to Tako and tried their spicy concoctions! Fresh, crushed jalapenos and just the right balance of marg mix with tequila sealed the deal for me with this drink. I'll order it again! Our friend sucked down her watermelon marg in record time and raved about it.  We started with fresh gauc, a side of pickled jalapenos and queso. The queso can be modified (add chorizo, etc) but we opted for regular. It comes out with a browned layer of cheese on top and the consistency is similar to hummus but the flavor is great! The gauc is fresh and even better paired with the pickled jalapenos! Two of our three got the pollo rojo (chicken) and I got the hongos (mushroom) Fresh and exploding with flavor! I look forward to trying more of their menu the next time I am in Pittsburgh.   Our waitress offered great suggestions, she was very knowledgeable and friendly. Great addition to Penn Ave and the Mexican food scene in downtown Pitt!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, and I will truly miss their spicy margs! Every time I have been here, the service has been above and beyond.  My friends and I came here for dinner yesterday, and the waitress came up to our table and asked us if we had realized our food had taken longer than expected (we were all having such a great time, we responded that we actually hadn't noticed). None the less, she told us our appetizers were on the house! I love coming here, not only for the bomb queso and spicy margs but for the great service as well!"}
{"text":"There's so many tables and really fast turnover so I've never had to wait even on a Saturday night. I've had the chips and queso (yum), chicken chorizo tostadas (good but I'd stick to tacos from now on), fish taco, mole taco, pork belly taco, and bistec taco. My favorite of all the tacos was the pork belly pastor with pineapple but I'll eat anything with pineapple."}
{"text":"Love this place for a casual night out complete with yummy tacos and an awesome spicy margarita! Sometimes it can be a bit loud so it is better for a group or a low key date night. The guacamole is really good and I haven't had a taco I didn't like. The tacos are the perfect size to try a few different kinds."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with co-workers while in town for business.  It was definitely a good choice.  We started with the appetizer special - chips, guacamole, queso, two salsa's for $10.  The queso was amazing.  The guacamole was chunky and had just the right about if kick.  Great that they refilled our chips since we still had a lot of toppings left when the chips first ran out.  I ordered the spicy margarita and it was perfect.  Loved that it is served in a mason jar and the jalapeño's give it a great kick.    PBR's for $2 are served in cute boot glasses.  Ordered the fish taco and the hongos.  Both were really good.  But hands down the fish tacos were the winners of the night.  The place had a cool relaxed vibe, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar. Food and drinks exceeded expectations. Better than the Mexican food I had last week in Boulder, Co."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Awesome food. Awesome margaritas. No Happy Hour but always has $3 PBR in a boot and a $3 Shot of the day."}
{"text":"i love this place. amazing service and food, although i do think some of their tacos need more flavor. nonetheless, this is one of the better places to go in cleveland if you're craving a taco."}
{"text":"Coming from California we have been searching for a great taco place for over 3 yrs. we read most of the reviews and thought what the heck. We stopped by this past weekend and tried all of their tacos and margaritas. I have to say the margaritas were on point!!! The tacos were just okay. The tacos would be a lot better if the tacos shells were more authentic. The shells were under cooked and tasted like cream of wheat. Hopefully they will change their taco shells. Stay tune...."}
{"text":"We went here expecting good tacos and left a little disappointed. I had been craving good tacos all week and this did not cure the itch. This restaurant is more Tex than Mex. The tacos were fine but small, as they tell you when you order. They are designed for you to try more than one.   If anyone in your party is gluten sensitive, they will be very very limited on what they can eat. Most of their food is braised fried or breaded. The quacamole was fine but nothing special. The margaritas were the same, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Ever since Pure closed down in downtown Matthews, I have been searching for a replacement margarita spot.  This may be \"the one.\"  Sadly this corner spot on Kenilworth and East Blvd has been occupied by many bars... and for some reason they seem to go away... maybe it's the parking situation?  Or something else, but I hope Bakersfield is here to stay for a while.  I love the space... lots to look at from the interesting wood textures and industrial looking light figures.  The HUGE windows that they can open up to the street and really have a great vibe going on inside.  The bar itself occupies the whole middle space of the restaurant and whiskey - though I have not partaken in any yet (I'm still sold on the margaritas) occupies some nice shelf/display space behind the bar.  There are booths and tables... some tables consist of some unique barrels which is a plus.  Definitely adds to the \"western\" (loosely using the term here) theme.  There are TV's here, but they don't play sports... they play old westerns.  Which is definitely different.  Probably the best part of the place (aside from the alcohol) is the food.  Tacos!  They are not your typical taco place, but the food they make here is very yummy - and pretty to look at.  My favorite is the short rib.  Combine that with some margaritas, and you got a great night ahead of  you.  Oh- did I mention that the bar has an old school juicer (handle and all) so they use fresh squeezed limes to make the margaritas!  So good.  Sometimes I do feel for the juicer guy... people (like me) order pitcher upon pitcher and he just keeps squeezing away.  At least he won't have to go to crossfit in the mornings after my friends and I visit. ;)"}
{"text":"I stopped here on a stormy Tuesday thinking it might be less busy and I could easily find a parking space.  Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.  Thankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.    The bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.    The food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.  I went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.  The tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.  Service is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.  So if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one. But honestly, my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moe's down the street. After spending some time at Bakersfield, I wish I would have chose Moe's.    This place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website, it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest.  In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40, improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for  blocks to get there.  I cannot see myself coming back here until something changes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco shops I have ever been to world wide. Their guacamole dip and the cheese dip  were fantastic!!! The beer selection was decent and the tacos were fabulous!! We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tacos- bam. Authentic, yes. That cochinita burned my mouth just like I was in Mexico. It was perfect. ( but super spicy, newbies, beware!). Pork belly taco was my least favorite but the short rib was the bomb. The margs were very good! They make their mix in house which is nice. Skillet queso was better than I expected and so was he guac. I have VERY high standards for my guac and this place delivered. Nice and chunky like a casero! Yum!  Service was pretty terrible, but I never review solely on one bad service experience so hopefully next time the people will be happier!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe here. The communal seating can definitely be fun if you let it or it could suck if your table partners are crabby. It's a crapshoot but I enjoy it! The service was fantastic. Our server was super accommodating to us and our little one.  Tacos were good, but the tortillas were a tad on the thicker side. They make them in house, so I noticed there was a slight doughiness. Our favorite was the short rib taco. The meat was amazing and super flavorful.  The queso with sausage was very good as was the sangria.  I was bummed at the lack of changing table or family restroom. None of the restrooms had even a changing table in it. I get that they can be a hassle but man people with kids go out to eat too!  All in all a good experience but I've had better tacos."}
{"text":"Good guacamole and queso but my experience with the tacos has been variable. Would recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere to get some drinks on a patio. Service has been great every time I've been."}
{"text":"Good food- late night hours- lots of variety - gave them an extra star for making their own sour mix and having a good selection of whisky to choose from."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 different tacos (fish, al pastor, short rib, mole, and bistec) and a short rib tostada to try to get a sense of the variety. All of the tacos were really fresh, refreshing, and flavorful. The corn tortillas did get a bit soggy if that bothers you, but it didn't detract too much for me. My SO really enjoyed his short rib tostada although it wasn't my fav (it's kind of like BBQ pulled pork but a little tougher to chew if you're into that). If I were to go again, I'd go for just the bistec (LOVE the flavoring of the meat) and maybe fish tacos. And I'd definitely try the guac and queso everyone is talking about.  Everything is relative, right? This place might be a 3.3 star review if placed in San Diego, but in Pittsburgh it's closer to a 4.3 :)"}
{"text":"The theme of this place seems to be that they run out of stuff frequently. The first time I went they were out of the beer my husband wanted. The second time they didn't have the Bistec taco I wanted to order. They also don't have happy hour specials (odd, given the location of bars). Service is spotty too...   BUT!! the guac is fantastic and the tacos are all very good (at least the ones they haven't been out of). Tacos are quite small though so order your quantity accordingly. The good news is I think they have really good potential. They're still pretty new to Ohio City and may have kinks to work out. I'll be back, cause the food IS good and the decor is chic and cozy."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear about this place opening and I was very impressed. It has a very rustic look which I love! And the food is amazing.  I started with the queso which isn't a traditional queso. If you are expecting some typical melty cheese you probably won't like this. It has a consistency similar to hummus. I personally liked it but my friend did not. We also got a red type sauce and verde salsa for dipping. The red sauce has a little bit of a bite to it and it has a very smoky taste. The verde sauce was once of he best verde salsas I've had. It had a lot of flavor which a lot of other places can't seem to master. I also got a traditional margarita which was very good as well and came served in a mason jar!   As for the entree I got a fish taco and a pollo rojo taco. I would highly recommend the pollo taco. It had a nice bite to it but it wasn't overpowering. The fish taco I wasn't a huge fan of because I thought the fish was too thick and it could have used more slaw and less fish.  My second visit I got the pork belly pastor taco which was amazing. We also got the guac and it may have been the best guac I've ever tasted. The perfect amount of like to give it some flavor. I would also like to say how nice the staff is here. I've never been anything less then impressed with the staff. Our server, Dylan, this last visit was awesome. He was very attentive and personable.   Overall I really enjoyed the food here and I definitely plan to go back numerous times.

{"text":"Awesome stop for Mexican in Pittsburgh! After a 4 hour drive in we were ready for some good food and strong drinks, we were not disappointed! The seasonal margarita was sweet, but out of the world! We split the short rib tostada.. the short run was melting in my mouth. This item had amazing flavor, I forgot to add the salsa on top! The sandwich is HUGE, so I highly suggest splitting it with someone so you can also enjoy some tacos!  I order the fish taco and an al pastor. Both OUT OF THIS WORLD! The fish was fresh and flaky. And the pork of the al pastor was sweet and spicy. I can't rave about this place enough!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Gotta tell ya folks. Awesome food & service. The duck liver pate' w/Sauternes Gelee was to die for as a starter. Smooth, creamy and I would spread it on myself and lick it off. Beverage menu selection was as craft as they come. Whiskey selection is some of best I've seen. We came with our dog and they allowed us to dine outside with him. He helped us finish our marrow bone app that was spot on with the orange zest. Wife got the cavatelli & I got the smoked lamb neck. Spot on with flavor profile.   Don't pass this one by folks.  #cheflife 2017"}
{"text":"Want to add to all the love that Bakersfield has deservedly received. The food is excellent, the drinks are top notch and the restaurant itself is clean and inviting. Some of the best tacos in Cleveland - definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Decent service, decent food.  I like the fillings on the tacos, but I don't like the floppy taco shell.  It's not even warm.  The queso dip has a good flavor, but it's very thick, not queso blanco and it's in a shallow pan, so sometimes it comes out like baked cheese rather than a cheese dip and gets cold and un-dippable fairly quickly.  They show old western movies.  They show one movie every day all day.  No sound though and no captioning.  Pandora-type music playing so it can change up quite a bit and odd with the western movie.  Parking is across Kenilworth where Kenilworth Coffee is as far as I can tell...or across East in another restaurants lot.  Something different every once in awhile."}
{"text":"OVERALL: variety of good fusion tacos with interesting flavors, and amazing service.   I went here with a large group of friends a while ago, and would probably come again. We ordered a ton of tacos - two huge plates full of them - and we got them in a timely manner. Our waiter was also friendly and funny, adding to the atmosphere. Great service! A solid 4.5/5.   As for the food, they're not the best tacos I've had. They were also a bit small for the price. However, the flavors were interesting and you could tell that the restaurant put a lot of thought into making different variations of traditional tacos, creating fusion food that was of high quality meat and other ingredients. Personally though, I'm just not a fan of some of the flavors, but that might also be because of my preference toward more traditional tacos. I give the food a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"great guacamole, awesome chips, awesome sauce (not just an expression--i mean, literally!) and decent tacos. i ordered the fish tacos and the al pastor. both were excellent and pretty filling despite their size. this is a fun place to go with friends or on a date with the hubs.   my only complaint is that it is a pain trying to find parking off east blvd, and i'm used to to the authentic cheap mexican taco. so $3+ per taco is a splurge for me. i guess it's worth it, because of the atmosphere. maybe..."}
{"text":"My three favorite tacos: fish, pastor, and cochinita. The food here is excellent and the atmosphere is great but it's just kinda overpriced."}
{"text":"Really great tacos (the bistec and fish were awesome), cool atmosphere/decor, good service. Sangria was just ok, my husband said the margarita was great and strong. It's obvious why Bakersfield had a crowd and other spots we passed on the block were dead at 10 pm. Would definitely recommend for the tacos alone!"}
{"text":"Easily the best chili in town.  I love their fresh made corn shells that come with their tacos.   This is the only place I know that serves Hutlacoche (corn mushroom) tacos. If you like mushrooms this is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Let me say that I love tacos. And I wanted to love this place, because let's be honest - the atmosphere is killer. We went here for my 30th birthday. We did have a larger party, probably about 12 people and they were just not equipped to handle this large of a group. It took the servers quite a bit of time to get our drink orders and come back with checks. The tacos here were just mediocre for me - with the exception of the brisket. They tacos are super, super tiny so if you are hungry you can easily eat 4. One thing they do have going for them is the atmosphere and their margaritas - at the very least, stop in and have a margarita. I would go back and try to give it another chance, but right now its just not my favorite Pittsburgh taco joint."}
{"text":"I love Bakersfield! Whether I'm going for lunch or dinner, it is always a great choice! It's an awesome place to go on a nice, sunny day because they open up the garage doors and it makes you feel like you are outside. They have a great drink selection along with delicious tacos!"}
{"text":"I actually feel like food was a three star but for overall experience I'll give them four. Why you ask? Well LET'S TACO 'BOUT IT!!! No? Ok sorry no puns. I'll just give a quick run down since there are 178 other reviews you can read.   Guacamole? FRESH and CHUNKY.  Queso? YUMMY and a hummus-esque texture I didn't know was possible... Hmmm Tortilla chips? Crispy and lightly salted. Yay! Al Pastor? The BEST taco ordered.  Cochinita Pibil? Eh. Not actually spicy.  Bistec? The second best ordered.  Short Rib? So-so. Not memorable.  Hongos? No thank you.  Server man? Very goofy/kind.  Vibe? Fun, relaxed, and a touch of cool you get with all Ohio City places Patio? Seems to be pet friendly.  Price? Fair. I think I spent around $15 on my meal.   The house made tortillas for the tacos were not that great really. Needs salt. Eh! Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is an interesting mix between \"Wild West\" and Mexican food, but it's all very Americanized. That being said, I love going here for happy hours and with large groups for drinks, but if I want authentic southwestern OR Mexican food, this probably isn't the place. They have a solid selection of beers and cocktails. The space is huge, an upstairs and downstairs. Tables are large and open. People may be standing around the bar or just casually in groups as well if they're just getting drinks.   Either way, they do have a lot of options for tacos! Although feta and radicchio may not be common in a typical Mexican taco, if you go into it knowing this is Americanized, the tacos are great. Vegetarian and vegan options that are enjoyable rather than boring.  Definitely bring your next work outing to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars from me. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away either.  I met up with a friend this past week for drinks and tacos. We arrived around 6pm on a Monday to my surprise find the place mostly empty. I thought for sure that it would be very busy due to being in the cultural district and prime after work hours, but I was wrong! We were seated at a high top table against the wall. One thing I do seriously want to give a shoutout to is the super comfortable tall chair I was sitting in. It was plush and comfortable and didn't make me feel like I was teetering on some small minimalist garbage stool the entire time. Big props to your interior design team.   Both my friend and I got house margs and a we shared some chips and guac. I found the margarita to be entirely too sour, as if it was made with a mix and not fresh squeezed limes. The guac was great--fresh ingredients, great texture, and the right amount of kick to it. We also got an order of queso that left MUCH to be desired. The top layer was full of great Mexican melting cheese, but the bottom layer was...grainy? I can't place what the flavor was but it was not anything that I want in my queso at alllllllll. It was a $6 mistake, for sure.   I ordered the pork belly pastor taco and the chicken mole taco, while my friend ordered the steak taco. The tacos were delicious--packed full of flavor and had me wishing I didn't waste my time with the gross queso so I could have had another one. HOWEVER, they are small. I'm talking fun-sized small. As in, they are charging you $4 for a baby taco. This may be a bonus for some people, but I'm putting you on notice so you can adjust your expectations.   This place does not do happy hour (which was definitely a con), but the service was attentive and friendly and I was in great company. By the time we left the place really filled up and was buzzing with a great vibe. I'd go back to place with a different game plan in mind (skip drinks and queso) and just do tacos for a good time. Being the only offering of it's kind in the cultural district, I can see it doing well."}
{"text":"If you are near West Side Market, stop by Bakersfield for a bite. We were greeted by Andrew, who guided us to our table and through the menu. We tried a few tacos, guacamole, salsa and some rye whiskey. All were tasty and reasonably priced. My favorite combo! Thanks for a great meal, Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Bakersfield last night w/ my sister for a couple drinks and tacos. We had a great time, as the margaritas were good, tacos were tasty and the atmosphere was just right.  Also - our server, Colleen, might have been one of the best servers I've experienced in the PGH area. She was super personable, excited about the offerings, knew her stuff, and just made us feel really good about our experience.   Will return."}
{"text":"George was great, super attentive and friendly. Took great care of us and told us how to best hear up our leftover queso at home. Thanks George! Best service I've had here yet."}
{"text":"I like Bakersfield to meet up with friends and have a drink.  That being said, it can get a little loud and noisy during a happy hour. Regarding the drinks, I loved their sangria.  I've had the tacos here a few times.  I think they are really tasty with higher quality ingredients - a solid choice but a lot of taco competition in the area.  The queso is not the best, but I've enjoyed the guac and the green salsa they have.  The service was not great.  We were there recently for lunch and they completely forgot our drinks.  A server also presented all the tacos ordered on a tray but the server didn't know which taco was which saying \"I think that's the pork...yeah...I think so\"  Not a big deal, but kind of a weird experience."}
{"text":"The staff are awesome. Truly friendly and responsive. The decor is the new standard of vintage bulbs, weathered wood panel with industrial flourishes here and there. The juke played a great mix of outlaw country and southern rock classics. The food was well above average. This is not a traditional Mexican joint and doesn't try to be. It's squarely a California influenced Mexican joint. I am looking forward to seeing how this place holds up over the long term, but if my experience last night is any indication, this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Such a great new place in town. Service is so friendly, food excellent, love the atmosphere. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I always frequent the boutique next door, so I have been patiently anticipating the opening since construction started late last year. Boy, am I pleased.  Bakersfield is a very modest Tex-Mex/Mexican hybrid, with a lot of offerings that I didn't expect to see at all. There is apparently a Bakersfield location in Cincinnati, but I'm very glad to see it claim W. 25th as a home, because it's probably my favorite barstaurant in the area right now.  The décor is very Texan-inspired, with Western films playing on the mounted flatscreens, tables made of crude stained wood, and bartenders occasionally wearing derby hats. Sitting at the bar is the best, because you can see their entire assortment of whiskeys and tequilas, and your drinks arrive quickly (duh). The service is generally very snappy.  The food offerings are limited to dips, sandwiches, and tacos, but there is a lot to choose from. The queso is served up in a shallow cast iron dish, and becomes absolutely magical when you add chorizo for a dollar more. The sandwiches, labeled as \"tortas,\" are incredibly large portions for $9-$10. I'd recommend the Torta Milanesa, because the butterflied chicken breast that they give you is fried just right.  The tacos deserve their own paragraph. There are six options, but the two that stood out to me the most are the Al Pastor and the Huitlacoche tacos. Al Pastor is an incredible culinary mixture between Lebanese and Mexican food, and Bakersfield did pretty well with spicing, pineapple-to-meat ratio, and giving it a unique spin. Huitlacoche, which is a fungus that grows on various species of corn, is a rarity in northeast Ohio. That being said, Bakersfield brought it to the menu, and it is definitely something worth trying. My only reservation is that all of the tacos were generally undersalted, and if you ate them in one bite or in a rush, they're rather forgettable morsels. Chew your food!  Phenomenal start, and I look forward to watching the restaurant grow and adapt over time."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here! We showed up at 9:30 on a Saturday night and the host said it would probably be an hour wait but we were seated in about 12 minutes! The server was very attentive and helpful, and explained all the options to us. We got chips and guacamole and chips and queso, and both had really big portions. We also ordered two tacos apiece (eight altogether) and they are fairly small but still very filling! They played old western movies on the tv and played old country music on the speakers - great atmosphere. We're from Canada but would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The margaritas are my absolute favorite! They have a seasonal apple cider one currently that I'm obsessed with. The tacos are very good, but on the smaller side so make sure to order at least 3. Sharing is always a good idea at Bakersfield because they bring them out on a single serving plate for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is great! Their queso is the stuff dreams are made of. Don't leave without trying it.   They usually have a couple good beers on tap, and the atmosphere couldn't be better on a sunny day with the windows open!"}
{"text":"I'm a true street taco girl and have been repeatedly unimpressed with the \"cool\" taco places.  I just don't understand why I have to pay a lot for an underwhelming taco with random meat and not a lot of taste when las palmas is serving me great tacos on the cheap... Basically I came in with low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised!  Queso with chorizo and salsa were great to start.  We had the short rib taco and the fish taco, both were awesome with great flavor AND a pretty reasonable price.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service, Margaritas and Tacos are all amazing!! Dilworth definitely needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I think I want to like it way more than I actually do. Cool bar atmosphere with an additional bar and table seating downstairs. Servers have been knowledgeable and fun. The atmosphere is fun but relaxed and can be intimate if you are seated in a good places, although, it can be loud at times and hard to have a conversation.  Prices are average/moderate.   I have had a few tasty drinks here including a spicy jalapeño margarita and a watermelon margarita. Both were delightful and I would come back for this! I only ordered food once. I thought the tacos would be a good choice considering it's a pretty standard staple to get at any Mexican restaurant but I was sadly disappointed. The tacos were served cold. The mole taco was bland but the fish taco flavorful and delicious despite it being cold. The queso had a weird texture to me and not like other queso dips I have had but my husband actually liked it.  I'd be willing to come back and try food again if someone wanted to but I'm more likely to come for another fun margarita!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food wasn't that good unless you can't live without super spicy foods. I wouldn't recommend it for a date because the music is so loud, you can't hear a thing, plus the shared tables would be a turn off. I'm glad we went to check it out, but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Meh.  Food was bland and the acoustics inside were not very good. Add some sound deadening foam to stop the echo."}
{"text":"Bakersfield has a beautiful interior. It also has wonderful patio with a nice little view of the westside market and a bit of downtown cleveland. The chips & salsa were tasty. The shrimp, mahi, and pork tacos were all good as well. Though the food has a strong presentation i feel that the food was a bit bland. Also i have to take down half a star, because they have no rice on the menu. I can say the this place has top notch margaritas! 3.5 stars. Good job."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, especially for the cost. A little noisy during the dinner rush, but other than that no complaints. Waitstaff was friendly and fast, food came out quickly, and the food itself was amazing- unique twists on Mexican dishes without losing the flavor. Definitely plan on going back again"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are my favorite food, and this place had the best one I've ever eaten.  The chips are warm and thick - just how I like it!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Rachel was our servicer and she was amazing! She was quick, helpful when navigating the menu and offered great suggestion. You have to go here."}
{"text":"I have had Bakersfield in Columbus Ohio before and was delighted when i moved down here and saw that there was one right down the street from me. I came here on a Tuesday night for a quick dinner and left very happy. We started with the chips and queso. The queso at Bakersfield is very different from your normal mexican restaurant queso. It is thicker and has a smoky flavor. I love it but some of my friends hate it. You honestly have to try it to see if you will truly like it. My friend and i both got tacos and were very happy. I got a fish taco and a mole taco. The mole is very solid, but the fish taco stole the show. The crispy mahi was perfectly breaded and added a great crunch to the taco. My friend being vegetarian got the Hongos and the Huitlacoche tacos. He was really happy with both of them. Also, I do remember from the Columbus location that the Margarita's are a step above.  They are super strong and will hit you in the face like a pile of bricks."}
{"text":"Used the no wait app. Told suggested arrival time was 9pm. Arrived at 845, told it would be well over an hour wait because they had reservations for multiple large parties. Really looked forward to trying it and probably will try to go there again in the future but they need to be more realistic about wait times and if you're using an app like no wait, be more considerate of what your actual wait times are. The bar area was too packed to even pass the time with beverages. It was a rare GNO with my mom friends, and this momentarily threw a little snag in our plans. That time is precious and rare, too much so to wait in line for 2 hours, huddled by the entrance."}
{"text":"Taco fan? Then Bakersfield should be on your list.  Bakersfield has good drinks and some delicious tacos. However, my favorite thing on the menu is their queso. Arriving in its own mini skillet, the queso has been baked in the oven so that the creamy cheese has a golden brown top. The caramelized top adds flavor and texture which makes it different from many of the queso options out there. Avoiding one of the major pitfalls of many dips (dip to chip ratio per order), the queso arrives with an enormous basket of chips so that no bit of queso will go uneaten. (Though a spoon would work just fine in a pinch.)  The tacos at Bakersfield are small, so order a few. Some of the most delicious options are the cocinita pibil, the short rib, and the Baja shrimp.   I also enjoy their margaritas, which you can make spicy with peppers for just $1 more!  As far as service goes, the food comes out quickly, but the drinks (especially mixed drinks like margaritas) might take a little longer during happy hour."}
{"text":"OK, 4 starters; a friend recommended me & my husband to go try out this \"cool\" Mexican restaurant on 25th and as we walked in we noticed the atmosphere right out of the gate and as was perfectly put by Michele B, \"It's sort of Tex mex honky Tonk meets rustbelt industry\"!!!  The decor was awesome - the feature wall of the liquor has great lighting with MANY different offerings and if ur looking 4 tequila u found THE spot!!  If tequila isn't on ur agenda ask Daniel (the bartender), he went above & beyond going over the varieties and what type of drinks we may or may not like and he didn't disappoint!!!!  Daniel suggested the Cucumber Margarita and it was AWESOME, right on point!!  Next, it was on 2 the food - started out with the very fresh crisp chips w/the side of salsa, black beans & guacamole - it WAS the best combo - VERY fresh and the guac was fresh and chunky!   We ordered the Baja Shrimp taco, the Fish taco and just 2 add a little more spice we ordered the Short Rib Tostado.  All 3 dishes were knocked out the park!!!  The shrimp taco was crispy & fresh and lots of shrimp - NO skimping with the perfect combo ingredients to say \"hey, don't even think about it!\"  The fish taco well - it had great texture and and after 1st bite I knew, \"there is no we in taco\"!!  The Short Rib Tostado...I don't even know what to say about this because as I had started to maneuver my way around the dish I knew there was no turning back!  The menu was short and sweet, exactly what u want a menu 2 b!! I also really liked the fact that the manager (Brittani) came around to check on how everything was going as well as the staff - all were knowledgeable & very helpful - not overbearing but social. Definitely looking 4ward 2 r next visit and working r way thru the menu - HIGHLY recommend it - if u haven't bn there yet, get off ur ass, u will NOT b disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Very tasty food, good service, and upbeat, casual environment. Very worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quality Mexican fix in the heart of Pittsburgh? Look no further than Bakersfield. The menu features all the staples that have given Mexican inspired cuisine a permanent home in American culture.   Tacos, quesadillas, Tortas, and Their famous quesos with fresh made tortilla chips. My standouts are the fish tacos and the chorizo. Good chorizo is hard to find!   Another great find with a pretty simple formula: good food, good service, great price. Now the downtown parking? Not so simple...."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the tacos at Bakersfield we enjoyed the queso app very much.  the Mahi taco and the Bistec  were very good. The short rib was the best of the night for me. Our bar tender made some incredible pineapple margaritas with a cayenne pepper and salt rim amazing. Scott our waiter was very attentive and Jen Sale checked us out to insure we were well cared for.  Thank you for a great, fun experience  Once again fantastic fish tacos and the Al Pastor taco was awesome. Thanks Sarah for recommending the charizo in our queso and for the fantastic service. The manager greeted us right away and saw to it that we had a pitcher of margaritas fast thank you Mathew"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: this place feels more like a bar than a restaurant. It's a little dark, a lot loud, but also very fun.  Food: the queso was delicious and addictive. Chips were delicious and seasoned perfectly. I had the short rib taco and the bistec taco. The short rib taco was fantastic - great flavors, the meat was tender and juicy. The bistec taco was okay - the steak marinade was a little too sweet, and there was a disproportionate amount of slaw. Still a good taco, but it didn't live up to the short rib taco.  Overall, this is a great place for a tasty meal"}
{"text":"Went here because of the 4.5 stars. I'd give the place 3. It wasn't that great. Small menu, pricey tacos. Nice service"}
{"text":"Had some friends in from Asheville and we wanted to go to a place with fun drinks and good food.  We selected Bakersfield.    The vibe is trendy.  We were seated immediately as well.    We ordered a bottle of wine and a pitcher of spicy margaritas!    Drinks came out promptly and service from Moriah was excellent .  I went with Moriahs recommendation and got the Johnny salad with chicken and chipotle honey dressing on the side.  It was delicious.  My husband got the mole taco and short rib tacos.  He raved about the mole taco!  We will definitely be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"How did I wait this long to review Dilworth's new gem?!?  In short, I'm absolutely hooked on Bakersfield... to the tune of - I'm going every other week now!  The vibe is perfect for Dilworth and the menu is amazing.  Not only do they serve up the best tacos in Charlotte, they have a phenomenal Tequila menu.  That's my kryptonite!  It's a blend of California tacos with the warmth of cool lighting and wood inside.  During the warmer days the doors open up for an even cooler experience.  This particular location did not fare well in the past but I can guarantee Bakersfield is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was packed on a Friday night! A friend and I waited about an hour for a table for two. They really don't have much seating. Luckily you can get margaritas while you wait. I highly recommend the spicy margarita. Perfect amount of spicy and not too heavy on sour mix. Oh, and extra points for being served in a mason jar.   Post-cycle class and waiting for the table we were past hungry when we sat down and ordered chips and queso and guacamole. The queso is served in a skillet and is more melty cheese than complete liquid. Different and delicious. Guac is perfect. Oh and the green salsa on the table is to die for  I ordered one short rib taco and one pulled pork. The pulled pork was my favorite. A little spicy. The short rib was a little sweet for me. So if you don't like the sweet and spicy flavor I would get something else, but that one was my friends favorite.   Great service even though they were slammed. Our server even helped me pick out what to order for my boyfriend togo that would best reheat. We decided on the short rib torta. I'll say we made the perfect choice. I tasted a bite and it was amazing!   I got a togo order, 2 drinks, 2 tacos and split 2 apps and was surprised how low my bill was.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"our service was awesome and i think the pricing is fair. however i don't like the fact that they only use corn tortillas, they really stuff them with ingredients and they end up falling apart. i got the seasonal shrimp taco and a short rib taco. also the queso was good but different than normal queso."}
{"text":"Yum!  I have nothing but great things to say about Bakersfield!  - Amazing margs.  They are made from fresh ingredients and are definitely strong.  A woman sitting next to us actually asked the server to make her next one with \"less\" tequila.  To each is own? If you are in a group - get a pitcher. - We tried both the chips and salsa and the chips and queso.  It's no Barrio queso, but good! - Every time I have gotten the Papas Tostadas.  I really need to branch out more, but I love it."}
{"text":"When we went there it was crowded felt like we were in right place. We then ordered 6 different tacos out of which the shrimp taco was the good one rest all were ok( maybe we didnt get the right ones). We also got chips and guacamole which looked good. The best thing we had there was queso with chorizo in it. They get 5 stars for presentation. I just was hoping that the food tasted as good as it looked."}
{"text":"All in all the place is okay but I don't find it worth it's price when it comes to drinks. Many places downtown have high priced drinks but usually they are strong or at least a decent size. The margarita I got here was a tall glass filled with ice and didn't taste strong nor was it a good margarita... And cost $13. A place I may drop into for a quick taco but I definitely wouldn't plan on drinking here."}
{"text":"Had to see what the hype was all about so I braved the hour long wait for a table and tried Bakersfield last weekend. Very hopping environment- modern decor, great music, friendly bartenders, and most importantly DELICIOUS tacos. Everyone in my group is vegetarian but there were plenty of options available, and the hand made tortillas are a subtle but important touch. Well deserved fanfare, hoping they maintain a high quality experience moving forward."}
{"text":"I love tacos. I think I've mentioned that before, so I'm always excited to try new places when they open up. The tacos were every bit as good as could be expected. They had a good selection to choose from, not quite as exotic as the Tako selection, but no less tasty. I had the Mole, which was a shredded braised chicken taco. Normally I do not like onions, but the pickled onions on this taco really set it apart. I'm glad I didn't order without. That said, I would have liked a little Mole sauce perhaps, it could have used a little sauce for moisture, but otherwise top notch. I also had the Pork Belly Pastor. This taco was an absolute star. Absolutely delicious. In fairness, I did avoid the raw white onions on this one.   The place is also known for their tequila, and I would definitely say do not miss the chance to have a margarita here. The lime is fresh squeezed which really makes a huge difference. I could have had about a dozen of these.   The service here was really great as well. It was very casual and informal, but friendly and prompt. Ashley was our waitress and she was so friendly and energetic it was impossible not enjoy the experience here.   Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Queso dip with jalapeño was on point. The spicy margarita didn't have much spice until I ate one of the jalapeños. We ordered 4 different tacos, I had the fish and mole, which both were very good. The sauce they gave you in the bottles was really good too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here before the steeler game and it's location is good because it's right before the bridge to walk to the stadium. We sat at a community table with other people we didn't know which was different. We ordered margaritas to start off. I got the premium margarita it was nice strong and not too sweet. I hate when margaritas have more sugary base than the alcohol. This had a perfect mixture. I got two of them. We ended up getting a few tacos. Everything was al la carte but you should order three to get a meals worth. They bring the whole tables food on one tray. I got the shirt rib taco, fish taco, and chicken. I think the short rib was my favorite. They made the tortillas the traditional way similar to how they are in Florida. We also got the guacamole and had salsa on the side. The guac was creamy and my favorite salsa was the verde. Our server was really sweet and funny. She engaged in conversation with us and recommended the best drinks."}
{"text":"These weren't what I considered \"gourmet tacos\" like what other people think on here. Good quality tacos, for sure, but not gourmet level. They do handmake the flour wraps, and the toppings are quality, but I don't think it's anything that is better than a good sit-down taco place"}
{"text":"Still four stars; the only thing I don't like about Bakersfield East is that other people like it too so there's always a wait! We went back almost a year to the day as last year. We've been 4 times in the last year with different people from out of town and they all liked it. It's the type of place I'm not scared to bring someone.   I had the steak and short rib tacos, queso and guac app. Fresh and flavorful. The tacos are still small but still packed with taste. This seasons sangria is a red wine with apples and a blackberry. I'm sucker for sangria so I get it every time.   Just FYI - It was just as hot inside as outside; they might as well open the garage doors since they don't do much to keep the summer out."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the Columbus Ohio location and this experience made me want to even more! Simple menu that allows you to get good Mexican food. Had the Pollo roho and hongos tacos.... fabulous. Didn't order drinks but their selection is wide."}
{"text":"There customer service was very poor. Trying to make reservations was terrible. They don't take names over the phone, they don't take reservations if your party is less than 6, and open table is cut off mid day. Food is great and the queso is fantastic! The main issue is there there wait time is always 45 min+ and you can't reserve over the phone. mjc382z@gmail.com"}
{"text":"tacos for dinner today more tacos for lunch tacos forever  Outstanding. The \"Loretta\"salad was perfect. Loved the chipotle/honey vinaigrette and the prefectly fresh ingredients.  I'll have another today.  We tried 7 different tacos.  The tortillas are made fresh in house. I expected at least one to be \"meh\", but nooooooo....    ....all were delicious.  I'm so glad we have a Bakersfield. So glad.  Carry on, and eat tacos."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite taco place. We visited during rails conf and had dinner here twice. I love the shrimp tacos and their margaritas. The atmosphere was chill and the chips and guac were also delicious. I miss this place and their awesome tacos."}
{"text":"I've been wanting try this place since I'm in Pittsburgh for a month. I came in on a Monday night and sat at the bar, took a minute for the bartender to say hello, but he eventually did and he gave me a menu. Small basic menu, chips & salsa, a couple salads, couple tostadas, sandwiches and a number of tacos. I started with chips and salsa and a premium margarita. Margarita came in a tall highball glass, it was pretty but way too sweet for me . Chips came out warm with a tomatillo salsa - tasty but not spicy at all. I ordered 1 fish taco and 1 bistec taco. They were good, not spectacular, but tasty. A Pittsburgh taco. I also added a side of black beans - whoa!! Way too salty!! Not good, way too much salt. Overall my meal was fine. I was missing my mom's homemade Mexican cooking, I was hoping this meal would satisfy that craving just a little bit, but sadly it did not. Nothing beats moms homemade beans & tacos. Ambience was great, would I come back - eh, not really sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! Joseph and Jason are great, food is amazing and have the best margaritas"}
{"text":"10 years of SoCal Mexican food has ruined me. Bakersfield is the first Mexican restaurant I've wanted to come back to (outside of CA). The space and the vibe is cool, the tacos are great with more a fresh mex feel (no beans and rice or tons of cheese), guac is good. The red Sangria is some of the best I've had. It's wine and fruit with minimal sugary stuff added. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some tacos on a Saturday morning. Turns out 11:30am is the perfect time for Tacos and Tequila. There were only two other tables of diners in the joint so we got seated right away.   I went splitsies with my husband, so I got to try a lot of different things.   Jalapeños margarita: This was pretty yummy. I liked that I got a lot of jalapeño flavor without too much spice. I did think it was a little too sweet, though. Tastes like maybe they use sweet and sour mix? I prefer a more tart, alcohol forward marg.   Queso: I really enjoyed the flavor (the chorizo and the jalapeños were a nice addition). But I was thrown off by the hummus-like texture. When I order queso I want you to give me molten liquid cheese so I can pour it down my throat. You better believe I ate it all though because... cheese.   Fish Taco: Great if you really like the taste of fish. I know that sounds kind of dumb and obvious, but this particular fish taco had a much more fishy taste than most I've had. This was my husband's favorite.   Short Rib Taco: Hands down -- This one was my favorite. The short rib was tender and the flavor was so good!   Pork Belly Taco: I'm not a fan of pork belly. Not even a little bit. But I tried a bite and whoa the flavor combos were heavenly. The chili and the pineapple made me happy. The little cubes of pork belly were fatty and perfectly pork belly-ish.   Huitlacoche Taco: This is what they call the \"corn truffle taco\". Otherwise known as \"corn smut\" or pathogenic corn fungus (don't google it, just eat it). Earthy but mild and really enjoyable.   Mole Taco (braised chicken): Couldn't really taste the mole on this one, but it was still really good. The pickled red onion was on point.   Important to note that the tortillas are pretty small, but they are delicious!  Overall, a good first experience at Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Drinks were good (the watermelon margarita was a little too sweet) the queso is out of this world as is the guacamole. All the tacos I tried were pretty good however the tortillas weren't the best, service was real good as well."}
{"text":"I drive past this place nearly every day at lunch and it looks empty inside unless the garage doors are rolled up but my friends have said this place is a great Dilworth spot at night. Our group headed up from the burbs on a Saturday night. We had 6 and they don't take reservations. The wait was 75 minutes and that was cool since we were not in a rush. Lighting is cool and it was very busy but not uncomfortably crowded.  The girls found seats at the corner of the bar and the guys bellied up to a \"trough\" bar top nearby. Bar service was quick and it was noisy but fun. After we were seated we started out with fresh chunky guac, creamy queso and a green salsa that was tasty. The menu is small but varied enough. I had the spicy pork tacos which were hot but not over the top. The short rib taco was my second taco and this was delectable. Highly recommend. At the table several ordered the  fish tacos and were happy with the choice. It was a great group night and didn't break the bank. Considering I ate 17 lbs of chips and dip two tacos were plenty of food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were at the west side market.  We were walking by and were intrigued so we stopped in.  The food was great and reasonably priced.  We called our daughter up to neet us so we asked for our queso to be heated up when she arrived.  They took the queso back and brought us a whole new serving fresh.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Can Bakersfield East Blvd survive this revolving door of a cursed location? *Insert dramatic music here*   Finally had a chance to check out the new nino on the block (see what I did there). The Hitman and I ventured here last week for dinner and drinks. It was rocking for a Wednesday evening.   I love the decor. The cool old school light bulb type fixtures that hang, garage doors opening to the sidewalk, vintage Western movie playing on the tv... great vibe.  We started with guac. Loved the fresh radish garnish on top. I went with tacos... one short rib and one pastor. Both were pretty good, but I would declare the short rib the winner in a face-off.  Drink special alert: PBR's are just $2 every day and come in a boot. Disclaimer: not an actual boot, but a glass shaped like a boot. As hard as it was to pass up a boot, I decided on a margarita(s). Salted rim and mason jar for the win!   Staff is ridiculously nice. Seriously, it felt like 45 different people checked on us. We chatted with the manager as well. So friendly.   If you don't live in this hood, here's where it gets tricky. And this has been the problem for every restaurant in this space: parking. They don't have a lot. Be wary about parking in the Harris Teeter. The peeps there are not happy about it. Bakersfield does offer valet across the street at Berrybrook.  Best of luck to Bakersfield. I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times and had great service. This time through that was the opposite. I sat at the bar right by the drink making station. My drink order was taken and served fast. Ordering my food though was another story. It took over 15 minutes to get someone's attention for me to be able to order. In that time I was passed by multiple people behind the bar, many of them refusing eye contact once it was made. Many times these people were just joking around with each other not paying attention. Once I was finally able to order my food the bartender did apologize and said he was not trying to ignore me twice. I appreciate that but still not acceptable that others walked by as well nor does it fix the problem. I ended up ordering my food to go because I was so disappointed in the service. I will note when I got there they were busy but it slammed. When I left they were slammed."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place gets such good reviews. It doesn't not have a lot of variety on the menu, the tacos are small and mediocre and the guacamole is VERY plain. There are way better places to get tacos in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, they were busy but still fast.  I had the guacamole with 3 tacos, tries the fish, rojas, and pork. Love them all. A little pricey but so is everything down town.   Everything was excellent, a d it was real close to the convention center where I was working."}
{"text":"I got the Tostadas Papa (without the spicy pepper/Peperoni!) . Omg they were beyond good. Additionally the service is polite and the atmosphere in that restaurant is really relaxing and nice. You should definitely try this if you are looking for a Mexican food option. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food! Alexa the server came to our table once to take our order. The appetizer took a long time to be delivered. We asked for salt and pepper multiple times and she never brought it. When our tacos came out the tortillas were cold and so was the meat. She never came back to ask us how our food was."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 6, our friends arrived first and ordered queso which was awesome. Between us We ordered almost every taco and we loved every one of them. Guacamole was delicious and atmosphere was great. We were on the patio and loved it. Can't wait to go back.  Back again and tonight just as fun! Queso is just delicious, the queso has a nice melted center and a nice soft cheesy crust. You can't eat here without trying the queso.  Traditional margarita was well made and quantity ample in the pint size jar mugs.  I had the pollo Rojo taco which was the chicken taco suggested by our waitress. I liked it but it was a less smokey than I was anticipating based on her suggestion.  My friend had the willie salad with the chipotle honey vinaigrette instead of buttermilk and she said it was wonderful.  We sat on the patio and even though there were only 2 of us we never once felt rushed. Try Bakersfield the next time you are in Ohio city and looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Let me start with what seems to be across the board consistent based upon other reviews, the service/customer service was on point. Our waitress was informative and friendly. After finding a hair in our pitcher of margaritas a manger came over and apologized for the mishap and offered to pay for the pitcher. He was friendly and apologetic and took the 40 dollar pitcher off our bill. We probably could have still overcome the mishap with the hair bc we eat out enough to know that stuff happens and when it is remedied correctly it's a better outcome of a unsatisfactory situation. However, the food was nothing impressive. We ordered the chips and queso to start and it definitely wasn't bad, it was a little smokey unlike others I've had but again wasn't terrible. We both ordered a set of pulled chicken tacos, the pollo Rojas or something like that, the chicken was so dry it was hard to swallow, I had to dip my chicken in the queso to even make it through, my boyfriend couldn't even stomach eating the second one he ordered. My second taco was a breaded shrimp special, the shrimp wasn't awful, it was a little spicy, but it was hard to eat bc it was covered in cabbage and the smallest amount of guacamole so there was no cohesion in the taco. I ate one piece of shrimp and didn't finish the rest. Someone told us it was very similar to barrio and I will tell you that is absolutely incorrect. Sadly, in my opinion, they missed the mark with this place. Again, customer service was above average, the patio was neat and the decor was cool, and truly the margaritas weren't bad, but I've had better margaritas at better prices and the food was way below average."}
{"text":"The queso here is amazing and the tacos are also awesome. I love that they have tortas on the menu as well. Service was awesome, good beer selection, and they're always packed so you know they're good!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review of Bakersfield.   I have NEVER went from giving a one star all the way up to a five star. Our first visit was something that made me say I never wanted to come back. The manager, AJ, reached out to me asking to give them another try, and my husband and I agreed. It was a total 180.   Cucumber margaritas were added to the menu which my husband tried and he said it hit the spot. We had the quest fundido and the chorizo had perfect flavor. We tried an assortment of tacos. When we had them the first time, there was no favor. This time, they were great. IMO the short ribs is the best. They had a chicken taco on the seasonal menu that had some spice to it, and hubby loved the carnita taco.  Our waiter, Scott, had a great personality and kept checking in with us. He suggested their fresh squeezed lemonade and holy cow it was good.   We are glad we gave it another shot and Bakersfield has officially been re-added to our list of places we will go to again. Nice job, guys!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and my group and I decided to explore outside of the main downtown strip for food. BEB was SLAMMED when we got there on a Wednesday night, which lead me to believe that this place is good. Truthfully...it wasn't bad. It was pretty good...even though it was hot as hell inside.   We ordered chips, queso, and salsa as an appetizer and it was ok. Nothing special but it was a sufficient thing to snack on while waiting for our food. I ordered a short rib torta that came with mild salsa...it was pretty good in the \"it's filling\" way, not in the \"this is delicious\" way. The rest of them got some variation of tacos, and apparently not enough, because they were all still hungry. Their beer options were pretty limited. They only had a few beers on tap, but their bottle list was a bit more dynamic.   I'd possibly consider going back if/when I find myself in Charlotte again. It wouldn't be the first thing want, but I wouldn't be mad if the group wanted to go. It was a-ok?"}
{"text":"Felt welcome here. Staff was great, food great. Had the Chicken Chorizo Tosada. On point, at a reasonable cost. House margarita was good as well. Only negative is that with all the hard surfaces, the noise level was quite high. Would definitely come back for a meal."}
{"text":"Once I heard that there was a new taco place in Cleveland, I had to check it out ASAP. My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 7 pm about a week after it opened and it was pretty packed. Luckily, there were only two of us and we were able to snag a couple of seats at the bar. We were served right away and didn't want for anything the entire time.       Although we didn't try a margarita, they do have a pretty good beer selection. We started with chips and salsa for $3 (which I believe should always be free, but whatever) and it came with 4 different salsas. I wasn't a fan of the smokey one, but I loved the rest and experimented with mixing different combinations together until I made one I loved.       For our meals, we got a short rib torta (basically a sandwich) and the mole (chicken), bistec (short rib) and cochinita pibil (pork) tacos. All were delicious, but the pork was my favorite. The short rib torta was the star of the meal.       Overall, the experience was great, especially for a place that just opened. We will definitely be back - especially in the summer (they have a great looking patio)!"}
{"text":"I heard bakersfield was good from multiple people, and decided to give it a try. We called to see if reservations could be made, and they suggested the no wait app which worked out. To start, the queso is the best ive ever had. It was amazing!!! The guac was also really good. Three people ordered tacos, which 2 people said were grear. Another said were a little dry. My food did not come out (chicken torta type sandwich. I was in no means upset, due to being full from all the queso I had. The manager came and sincerely apologized saying the sandwich was not cooked to how they liked, and wanted to bring a new one out. She said she would take care of it. It came out about 5-10 minutes after everyone else was eating. It was amazing ! The manager brought the check and comped our ENTIRE bill. That was completely unexpected. The customer service was beyond fantastic. The food was amazing too. I will definitely suggest bakersfield to others!"}
{"text":"Such amazing tacos! You can order individual tacos and each one is so good! They have it all from pastor to veggie tacos! And the drinks here are also amazing. The decor is dark and hip and a great place to meet up with friends, it can however get a bit loud in here at night! I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The tacos were delish, the margaritas strong, and the staff lovely.  They keep the rock n' roll pretty loud on the weekend, so don't plan on staying long, let alone relaxing. I appreciate a concise menu and a fast turn-out on the food.  I love authentic Mexican food and often abhor \"new American\"-style taco permutations, but both the mushroom and the pulled brisket were tasty and filling.  The chicken was good too, if a little dry.  The house-made soft corn shells may be the best part.  Barrio has nothing on this place - leave it for the kids.  Funny that aside from the menu, absolutely nothing about this restaurant is, in fact, Mexican.   It's the owner(s) insurance for an easy re-branding if the whole Mexican thing doesn't work out."}
{"text":"My brother and I risked our lives to eat here the other day since we almost got hit by a car running a red light when we tried crossing the street in front of Bakersfield. Thankful to be alive, we were greeted warmly by two hostesses and seated immediately.  I really liked the interior and the space. We were seated at a high top near the bar and not too close to the huge open windows in front which lets us enjoy the nice weather outside. We were about get a margarita pitcher (64 oz) but wisely reconsidered after doing the math of how much the two of us would actually drink and because it was 11 am. John got the Bakersfield one and I tried the Seasonal Margarita. Both were refreshing and had a generous lining of salt on the glass rim.  Food was great! Not only did it come out fast but everything was fresh. I really enjoyed the fresh made tortilla chips that were warm and crispy. Just the right amount of salt. The guacamole was very good, with the right balance of chunky and creamy. For tacos I tried the fish which was crispy and balanced with the tart and sour slaw and the short ribs which were tender. My brother inhaled his 3 tacos (he's been here before).  The meal was worth crossing the street again."}
{"text":"I had heard Bakersfield's tacos rival that of Tako so I had to give it a try. It's a large restaurant and bar that probably usually has a one-hour wait on the weekend. It's noisy but not impossible to have a decent conversation seated either at the bar or at a table. We ordered margaritas and sangria. The margarita was strong but balanced. The red wine sangria was warm (they didn't put the sangria in a chilled mixer) and bland.   We skipped appetizers and ordered five tacos: pork belly (2), fish, steak, and short rib. The pork belly pieces were too small and overcooked. Also there was no sauce on the taco, so the taco itself was also dry. The steak and short rib were excellent. The steak in particular is slightly spicy, very tender and the best by far. The short rib was a close second. The tortillas were dry and didn't add anything to the tacos.   In sum, Tako has Bakersfield beat by a mile. This definitely isn't worth waiting an hour for."}
{"text":"I have serious mixed feelings about this place. Food and drinks were good and nicely presented. The service was awful! The girl spilled a drink on my coworker, forgot water twice, initially took 20 minutes to come over to even take a drink order, and there were flies everywhere! Obviously, not the waitresses fault, but pretty nasty. I wonder if it would have been better if I had a different server?!"}
{"text":"I always say there is no such thing as a bad taco. That said, there are certainly degrees. Bakersfield has a very cool vibe and staff is friendly. As everyone says, the guac is outstanding. For tacos I got a mole chicken and a short rib taco. The mole was tasty but the short rib was out of this world. The tacos are small but they are stuffed full and you will not leave hungry. Mmmm, just thinking of them makes me want to go back now. I shall return."}
{"text":"The server was fantastic today. I was with a few people who hadn't been there before and she welcomed us and did a great job explaining the menu. The guacamole and chips and a cold beer started our happy hour off right! We were able to secure one of the bar tables since we arrived a little before the happy hour crowd (4:30pm). The place did fill up over the course of the night, so it's clear Bakersfield isn't disappointing!  I have been to this location previously and also had good experiences. Everyone I was with really enjoyed the spicy jalapeno margaritas (I'm not a fan of spice), but they all loved them - so give them a try if you are in to spice! When I had the tacos before there was a good variety and the flavor of the chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a small scale chain restaraunt with a local/trendy ambiance. The tacos are small, so you'll want to order 2-4 of them if youre looking to get full. I ordered a fee tacos & a tostada & ill say i was way more impressed with the tostada. (More food piled on fried tortillas just made for better flavor & texture in my opinion). They have a really nice looking bar & a few good cocktails in the menu. This is a nice place for groups of people, but isn't too loud."}
{"text":"The bartender was an awesome girl! But the food was just okay. I got the fish taco and the short rib taco. The first had almost no flavor, the second was just okay, very mild. The guac was fairly plain as well. I won't be going again, unless someone begs of me, but it's not from a lack of service. Just train the cooks a bit better!"}
{"text":"What. The.... so good and had no idea this was here (super close to W side Market)   It was a little bit of a wait so we got margs - super tart and delish because they use fresh pressed juice. After we sat we ordered chips & queso and the server let us wait to put tacos in which was super nice. Even though they were slammed they came right out.   I had bistek, pork with pineapple and a veggie taco. All were spot on and house made sauces were flavorful and had a mild kick. Nothing too crazy.   At $3-4 a taco you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Nice new Mexican spot in the burgh. We are lacking great Mexican so Bakersfield, although a chain, is a nice addition to downtown. Prices are very reasonable and kitchen is always quick. Their house made guacamole was the highlight of the meal. So fresh and chunky with tons of lime and came out chilled (yet knew it was being MTO as it was late and our waiter informed us it would take longer than usual). Vegan options are very limited, with only one taco that's essentially black bean spread and guacamole. Lacking the vegetarian/vegan options. However I've heard great reviews on all the various tacos, all of which come loaded with toppings. It's a single taco per order and they are on the small side, so be mindful of that. Fun ambiance. Draws quite the night scene so be expected for crowds on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great taco place! Queso was amazing! I got the taco specials: spicy mahi-mahi, spicy shrimp, and short rib and all 3 were awesome! House margarita was good too!"}
{"text":"Really like this place!  Great tex-mex food and great drinks!  Had lunch there a while back.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were acknowledged in a friendly manner. We were given a moment to look at the drink menu before being asked for our selection, and that's rare these days. Our food was incredible. We ordered five different tacos and none disappointed. Only suggestion is to watch the amount of lime juice on the fish taco. It was slightly overpowering, but not too bad. Keep this up, and you'll have a customer for as long as I'm around!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday night after getting into town and called ahead. We were alerted the wait time was around 45 min but decided to head that way anyhow.   When we got in we put down our name and walked over to an open place near the bar. It was very busy and had shared seating - long booth on one side and high tops on other side. Bar has room to eat as well and there are usually two bartenders so your wait for a beverage isn't long.   After about 5min a seat opened at the bar so we took that and sat and watched the tournament games and talked about the week. Eyes big, hungry hearts type stuff. Soon there after, another seat opened at the bar and everyone got a seat so we put in a drink and food order there. The bartender (John? - Giants hat) was very attentive and got us going with drinks and some queso, adding that the food comes out somewhat fast so he staggered the app and food order so we weren't rushed.   ***NOTE: Tacos are small so make sure to order several***- which I was alerted to by my bud who had been there previously. We ordered several a piece and hung out sipping our beverages and hanging out. Time stood still.   Queso was VERY GOOD AND TASTY. The chorizo we added had a nice kick to it, and even though the chips were more plentiful than the queso, it was very good. As for the tacos - I ordered a chicken, steak and fish, and all three were good. They each were prepared a different way (slaw, sauce, etc) but all equally good with a nice tortilla. Chicken was more shredded with a hotter sauce, steak was cubed with a sweeter finish and fish was good and had nice sauce on it. Again, tacos were on the small side but overall the meal was just enough.   MAIN ISSUE: We ordered extra sour cream (or crema) and I mean to tell ya, it came in a condiment cup HALF FULL. I know it was only a dollar but we are big sour cream fans and feel like the amount we were given was like they were out of it or at the end of the container and just added enough.   We ended up not getting dessert and instead I had mine back at the hotel, but I highly recommend this place as a nice place to sit and eat and enjoy your time together. Great start to the weekend."}
{"text":"The tacos were excellent, the margarita was perfect, the service attentive and the atmosphere warm and inviting.  My husband and I loved Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Thanks to London who helped make our friend's bachelorette party so special! The service, food, and drinks were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm from Ohio so I've eaten at the Bakersfield in Cincinnati and Columbus. Let me tell you, I was PUMPED when I saw a Bakersfield was opening in Pittsburgh!   My boyfriend and I went when they first opened last summer... but it was a weekend night and the wait was around 45 minutes. No thank you!   Fast forward to February... I decided to meet a girlfriend at Bakersfield after work for Happy Hour, thinking that it would be less crowded after work on a week day. I walked in and awkwardly stood next to the hostess table for about 5 minutes before a hostess came over and greeted me. At first I thought it was closed for a private party and I was crashing... it was mostly young adults in business work clothes. However, apparently this place is just a hot spot for the after work crowd.  One thing I immediately noticed was how loud this place is! Very echoey and you kind of have to yell across the table at the person you're with.  The service from the waiter was great, despite it being super busy. I got queso, a margarita and two tacos. Everything was exactly how I had remembered it from the Cincy and Columbus locations-- delicious. The queso was different-- a little spicy but nonetheless delicious. I don't think I've ever met a Taco I didn't like. Bakersfield definitely gives my favorite PGH Taco Place in the South Side a run for its money!   Overall: service 8/10, ambiance 6/10, food 10/10."}
{"text":"Well they just opened yesterday, and I was shocked at how smoothly my experience was. I loved everything I ordered and my margarita was awesome. The space is super cool and I'm excited about hanging out here more.  Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Guacamole is worth 5 stars just by itself. Our waitress apologized for taking a little time to make sure the guac was fresh, it is so awesome it will be in a go to for many more times. The Bistec taco's were excellent in flavor, presentation & preparation. The chips and fresh salsa's were perfect. The house margarita was a large portion but the kicker was the fresh juices instead of cheap bar mix, yummy. Huge selection of Tequila's & Whiskey will make this a Uber night for sure in the future. This place will be one we go through the entire menu. All the staff were so friendly and prompt. Well Done."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided to come here base on all the good yelp reviews. The place is packed the vibe is good so we're thinking good choice. So after a 20 to 25 minute wait to be seated they take us downstairs to be seated, that's strike one for my wife  It was like we were being taken to a dungeon. No windows and no view.  So the waitress comes over after a few minutes, and takes out drink an appetizer order. It took another 20 plus minutes to take our food order strike two.  So my wife notices her playing in her hair and grabs the fruit that goes into my drink and put it in my drink no gloves and no tongs just bare hands.  So I ask her to make me another drink and please don't use her hands to at least use tongs and put the fruit in my drink not her be a hands. She turns around and does the same thing she did first time that's strike three  I'm done. This was our first but last time in Pittsburgh, but when we come to the city again I won't come here ever."}
{"text":"Great house margarita, actually liked it better than other choices. Queso with added chorizo was delicious. We had just eaten or would have tried more. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere here, the food, not so much.  We got the queso which came with chips and salsa which I was really appreciative about, because I'm not typically a fan of places that don't give you free chips and salsa.  The fact that they included chips and salsa in the queso price made it worth it.  The queso was a little different, I had mixed feelings about it.  It was kind of good, and kind of like when your friend attempts to make something and asks if you like it and you're obligated to say yes.  Not loving it, I would probably return and get it again, just because.  The chips and salsa were really good, I wish they were a little bit more spicy, but I guess that's what the $1 jalapeños (kind of ridiculous) are for.  The green salsa was my favorite, the red salsa was a little too smokey for my liking.  The bistec and the braised pork tacos were really good, the fish and rojo tacos were not so good.  The service was extremely fast when I went here and our server was very informative and nice which definitely got my rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and has a great atmosphere. Every time I go the food has been unreal. The Bistec Steak Taco's could literally stop a war they're so good. Guacamole is made fresh and is phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoy's Mexican/Tex Mex food. I would not recommend going in groups larger than 4. There's always people in large groups waiting that get pissed off because they don't have a table for 7 readily available. Dinning in the cultural district is not designed for larger parties."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were amazing, pineapple margarita spot on. And the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Took my friend from out of town to Bakersfield where I've seen and heard nothing but great reviews! I was dying to try all of the great tacos that I have seen on other people's reviews! We had chips and salsa, both the Verde and their roasted tomatillo salsa were amazing!! The Bakersfield Margarita was very good and tasted very fresh. The tacos came out and we tried the steak and fish tacos, both were so good! We were absolutely obsessed with the mix of flavors in the steak taco and the fish tacos were so delicious as well.   Will definitely be back to try their queso and guacamole and all of the other tacos on the menu!! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun place to try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Greatest queso in town!   I always take visitors to Bakersfield because the food is amazing, the vibe is charming, it's pretty inexpensive, and ... queso.   I suggest getting anything with short rib on it. And always, always get the queso. It's a little spicy but it will legitimately put life back into your bones. (It also makes the inconvenient parking situation completely worth it -- trust me).   The service is excellent and I've never waited too long for a table (though I usually go for a super early dinner just to beat the crowd).   Overall, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went during the afternoon for my birthday...Adam was awesome and gave us great service.  Food is solid and you can't beat the shot of the day/margaritas. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch today at Bakersfield.  First time here and I was impressed the moment I walked in. The atmosphere had that old west feel to it with southern blues / old style country playing in the background and a John Wayne movie on the TV above the bar. I took a seat at the bar and was cheerfully greeted by the barmaid. She mentioned a few of the drink specials (tequila inspired) but knowing that I needed to get back to work I nodded them off and went with an ice tea and a menu.   The menu here is all Mexican cuisine... tortilla chips, tacos, tostadas, tortas and few salads. Although I came for lunch, I couldn't help but look over the beer selection. Among the choices are Dos Equis, Negro Modalo, Carona, Pacifico etc. along with a health selection of domestics and crafts. Perfect beer selection to compliment the Mexican cuisine.   After ordering the Short Rib Tortas, I kept my eye out for what was coming out of the kitchen. The tacos, albeit smallish, all looked yummy but the few salads that I saw were of a generous portion. It didn't take long for my tortas to arrive and it had a plentiful amount of shaved short rib, greens and cheese between a ciabatta like bun with a nice, spicy salsa dip on the side. The tortas was not only filling but delicious.   I'm looking forward to coming back to sample some of the tacos and I'll also keep this place in mind as a location to meet up with friends for a drink prior to a show or game."}
{"text":"I always go to the one in Cleveland and this one is right on par. Awesome guac. Awesome margaritas. Awesome shot specials. Awesome tacos. Great place to go."}
{"text":"Dined here with a friend for a late dinner one Sunday evening.  There wasn't too much of a crowd, so we were greeted and our service was top notch.  We sat at the bar, and the bartender was super helpful about answering our questions regarding the menu.  The guacamole, salsa, queso and chips are bomb!  I filled up on that, and barely had room for my entrée--which ended up being okay because the tacos were lackluster.  I ordered the al pastor tacos and the meat was either overcooked or just too chewy.  I nibbled but left a majority of it on my plate."}
{"text":"I come to Bakersfield often and always receive the best service. The guacamole is amazing and so are the servers. Our server Jason was enthusiastic and polite. He made our lunch. I recommend this restaurant for more reasons than one. Come see fir yourself!"}
{"text":"Good margaritas and good cheese dip. Beyond that, the selection on the menu was \"average\" and the service was extremely poor. I unfortunately was served the wrong food order and when I informed the waiter, she became very hostile and insisted that I ordered another order. After she eventually brought out the original dish I had ordered, she refused to visit our table again and we had to physically get out of our chairs and get assistance from the manager and other waiters to serve us on multiple occasions. The waiter never returned to our table. Never will I return."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and I will definitely be back! We had to wait for about 30 min for a table but we were able to get drinks at the bar. During this time we also got to chat with the owner, such a nice guy.   We finally were seated. We ordered margaritas, guac, queso with chorizo and an assortment of tacos. Everything was delicious! I had the fish taco and would highly recommend it. Very reasonably priced too.   I also really like the vibe and atmosphere! I hope this place can survive in Dilworth, it is a great addition."}
{"text":"Food is good but does not blow me away. It's your average corporate taco joint with some creativity added. Menu has good choices for everyone. Food has always been consistent. Great place if you need a quick taco fix."}
{"text":"Hmmm....I didn't plan on wearing as much of my Pork Belly Pastor taco as I ate. My taco literally was swimming in liquid as it was delivered & fully self destructed as I picked it up. I had to ask for a fork. The Short Rib taco was slightly more substantial but also came apart. My husband had a similar experience and made a trip to the men's room to clean stains on his shirt.   The flavors of both tacos were terrific and the guacamole and salsas were awesome.  I was so excited for terrific tacos but the soggy taco shells were impossible to ignore.  Many places serve 2 taco shells when multiple ingredients are likely to seep through. Bakersfield, I'd suggest you might want to consider this. After all, who wants to eat their taco with a fork?"}
{"text":"OK so, I grew up with Mexican family members. I'm accustomed to really delicious and authentic Mexican food,which I've felt is hard to find in Pittsburgh. I miss the flavors of California, New Mexico and Arizona. I heard about Bakersfield from a friend and decided to try it.  I ordered the hongos tacos and my fiance ordered the papas tostadas. I wouldn't typically eat kale slaw, but I went with everything the taco came with. We also had chips and salsa, which I'm used to being free but costs $3 here.   The chips and salsa were fantastic. Green salsa is the best and this didn't disappoint. The chips weren't overly salty,which can be a problem with places I've tried.  The hongos were cooked perfectly and had a noticeable mushroom taste without being too earthy. The kale slaw complemented the flavors very well. These tacos are balanced and a great (proper small) size.  The atmosphere is nice. When I went, the big window was open. I do really hate high bar stools for seating, but there are also picnic tables. Alcohol isn't my thing, but the bar area looked fun!  Staff was attentive and friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Such. Good. Food!  I came here around 4PM, in between lunch and dinner because I was in the area, starving, could get parking and was glad I would be able to eat at this place I had heard so much about without getting on a waitlist or waiting in line. I ordered a virgin house margarita which was so good as well as a spicy mahi taco and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco was so so but the spicy mahi was absolutely delicious! Love the way it was seasoned and the touch of sliced green apple in it. I ended up ordering 2 more mahi tacos to go to eat later that night if/when I got the munchies. The service here was super friendly and pretty fast as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family & I came for lunch and had an awesome meal. After having the guac & chips, I had the el pastor , short rib( not my favorite)  and steak tacos. The el pastor and steak tacos were extremely flavorful & filling. We washed it all down with a pitcher of pineapple margarita; amazing ! Not too sweet and not too bitter. Thanks Bakersfield for showing this NY girl a different side of Cleveland dining"}
{"text":"Great guac, tacos are awesome and service was pretty stellar! Definitely must check out! We went around 330 Saturday and it was surprisingly busy enough! I can see why! My fiancé swore it was the best Mexican she ever had."}
{"text":"Came here knowing nothing about it, ordered one of literally every taco on the menu (Because seriously, how do you form an opinion without all the available information!).   Loved everything, even the corn fungus (no joke). I'm convinced this is the best restaurant of its kind in in NEO. This is saying a lot given the competition.   I felt cooler, fuller, and happier just being here. Our waitress was super personable and informative.   Hot tip: order a paloma to drink. You won't be sorry. Second hot tip: Don't park in the lot across the street. K&M Towing WILL tow your car. If they do, though, have more palomas and uber home."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Bakersfield. It's always nice to find good Mexican food. This was recommended to us by and local. Two of us went for lunch and had the queso appetizer with two tacos each. Plenty of food and super good!   Pricing is very reasonable for the area and service was good. If back in Pitt would definitely try again!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up to four. Hooray for fresh, gourmet tacos at Bakersfield! I went for dinner with my aunt on a Monday night and was thrilled to be seated right away without waiting--always a plus when my stomach is rumbling. We were right up on top of the people next to us (shared booth on one side), but that is pretty normal for small downtown restaurant spaces. Fine for a casual taco dinner, maybe not the best choice for a date night. Our server (I think his name was Josh) took a while to come over to us, so we were already ready to order our tacos along with the drinks. I asked for water and he kept pressuring me to try a margarita or glass of wine, which I thought was wildly inappropriate. I was just headed to the gym after and abstaining from alcohol at dinner, but what if I was a recovering alcoholic? This reflects more on the server than the restaurant, but it's worth noting in training that you don't question a guest's choice unless they ask for your opinion. We also tried ordering the tacos and he ignored us at first, trying to upsell an appetizer. No, I just want my tacos, thank you very much!   After ordering, the tacos came out fairly quickly (about 10-15 min) and were presented beautifully. I had the pork belly, chicken, short rib and fish (mahi mahi) tacos and thought they were all good, but really enjoyed the fish the most and give it 10/10--lightly battered, but not greasy, with just the right amount of acidity and tang. The chicken was my least favorite, as it tasted sort of like crockpot chicken I make at home. The girl who ran the food to the table was super helpful, cheerfully describing each taco and refilling our drinks.   I will definitely go back, have more tacos and try some guacamole and/or queso, but I am not completely enamored by Bakersfield. Solid and good, but not what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"One word - GUACAMOLE. So fresh and light and delicious, it goes perfectly with the fresh, salty tortilla chips. Make sure you try the salsas, too. Served in a squeeze bottle (sounds weird, but it works!), they are so flavorful and unique that you may find yourself running out by the end of the meal.  The menu is relatively small, but if you are in the mood for unique and flavorful tacos, this is a perfect spot. And since the menu is smaller, you can be assured that everything on it is the best possible quality. Try everything at least once - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"With a name like Bakersfield you are not expecting to walk into a place with some of the best mexican cuisine. Be careful though, their margaritas are dangerously delicious and will sneak up on you like a thief in the night stealing your sobriety and leaving you with a good night out.   I have enjoyed the tacos each time I have visited and they will not leave you disappointed. I highly recommend starting your night out here."}
{"text":"I went here during a conference and was pleased with the service I received. They were very good with giving me taco recommendations. I'm not a vegan by any standards but the vegan tacos were great. I also had a good fish taco. This is not a traditional Mexican restaurant by any means, but the corn tortillas were fresh and the fillings were great. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting downtown Pittsburgh looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Great place with a beautiful bar. The menu was simple and nice. I enjoyed the appetizers and the tacos. Good variety on the Tacos. Seating was a bit odd, with high tables thru the restaurant. Good service."}
{"text":"Decent margaritas, sub par tacos that are over priced and under filled. I was underwhelmed by the idea of having to purchase the chips and salsa when other similar restaurants provide those free of charge. The chips I did have were chewy and lacked that ever satisfying chomp.   This is a not a \"destination\" style restaurant as West 25th is not known for ample or easy to find parking and this is no different. It takes planning ahead and patience finding a spot.   One thing I wish I had known, is each side of additional salsa, sour cream, or even asking for a sauce on the side to ensure that you enjoyed the flavor is added cost.  EDIT Upon seeing my review, the GM reached out asking for another chance.   At the second attempt, I was pleasantly surprised to find out the chips were crunchy and well cooked. We tried the queso, though not your average white queso with smooth texture, their oven baked queso was a unique take on the standard.   Again, their margaritas were decent. Well made and using fresh ingredients from scratch. Definitely worth trying. I had the seasonal pineapple and it is truly scrumptious.   We tried their tostado and tacos for a meal. As someone with a sensitive palate, the bistec taco was a little spicy for me and I spoke with our waitress who gave me some options and even brought out samples of their other meats to find one that was more palatable for me. It was a wonderful experience. Though their tacos are small, they are packed with flavor. The tostado was fresh with a beautiful presentation. The meat was quality and had great flavor.   The waitress we had, Sheri, was superb and took the time to discuss all the options we had and even ones we weren't eligible for (the group selection) and worked not only with my sensitive palate but also my food allergies.  Just as a note, they do not currently have a dessert option so keep that in mind when eating there.  I completely rescind my previous statements of being underwhelmed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! I went here two nights in a row because it was that good. I'm thinking about continuing for day three to test out their $3 shots! The house made corn tortillas are so soft and do not fall apart like some. The manager Will was incredibly friendly and personable. Try the short rib taco and the Queso dip! Absolutely amazing. Our waitress, Maddie was so sweet and accommodating! Definitely a unique find and one you'll want to revisit."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Loretta salad here. I used to order it all the time for lunch when I worked in the area. I love the environment and the decor. It's a really funky place to eat right on the road with those big windows that open up when the weather is good. Parking is always suuuuper fun in Dilworth but after you find a spot, enjoy yourself some chips and guacamole, a few tacos, & some tequila. Or whiskey. Whichever you prefer. The cochinita pibil tacos and the huitlacoche tacos are so good. The al pastor was a favorite with a lot of the girls I worked with, but it just wasn't my favorite. It's a bit more sweet than I like my entrees to be. Overall, I do enjoy this restaurant and wish I got to visit it more often, but it's not always the first place on the list when I'm visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have been to Bakersfield several times and have never been disappointed! The Tacos Al Pastor are amazing! The service is also top notch.  One time our waiter noticed that our guacamole was taking a little longer than usual to come out and without us even saying anything, he went ahead and took it off the bill for us. This is a great place to go for a date or with a large group. I also love that they are on the \"No Wait\" app so you can put your name in ahead of time and spend less time waiting at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Most wonderful service for our group of ten! The salsa,queso, and guacamole were to die for. Our taco's were unique and Delish!!"}
{"text":"Bakesfield is such a cool spot!  I'm finally glad this establishment is in that location and it's there to stay!  The place was so busy but we were able to find a spot at the bar while we waited for our table.   We sat towards the back and had to walk through the drink station/kitchen area which was odd (I think to avoid walking through the crowd).  We tried six different tacos and they were all excellent.  Margarita was fresh and prices weren't too bad.  Will defiantly go again! I take off a star for parking.  Always hard to find a place to park at peak hours."}
{"text":"The guacamole is fabulous! Our server, Kurt, was wonderful. Made the experience fun and smooth, and he had fabulous recommendations, as well as fun twists on drinks."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars I would! This place was so great. I can only speak on the tacos since that's all I tried.   First, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming. The decor is nice but I wish it was a bit more bright. You know how some restaurants keep their lights a bit dim? Yeah, not a fan of that!  But the tacos, OMG! My personal favorite was the pork belly one. I really liked how it was paired with pineapple. I also enjoyed the short rib taco and the fish one as well. I would recommend trying all of them honestly. The amount of meat is generous! I think it is definitely worth the $4 dollars.   I seriously can't wait to come back here! They remind me of the taco trucks I like going to, but much more luxurious and meaty."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Charlotte. Order the queso and/or guac. All the food is amazing and keeps this Texan a little less homesick, but I especially love the June salad and the Short Rib Torta."}
{"text":"For such a busy restaurant we were seated quickly. The guac was the best I've ever had and the short rib tostada was to die for. Be sure to request Lindsey for the best service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here on Sunday afternoon for lunch and sat at the bar. On the whole everything was OK....not great, but OK. We were taken aback by the fact that none of the wait staff ever smiled. Everyone looked like they hated to be there. Not a cool vibe at all. We had three tacos. Her the fish one and me the Mole Chicken and the Short Rib. They were all rather bland.   I would be hard pressed to rush back to this place. It just didn't thrill us at all with and with all of the other better dining options around they need to pick up their game."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing, and the food was even better. We checked in online beforehand and were the first seated when we arrived. These are the best margaritas in Cleveland, and the food is just as good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Good atmosphere and obviously the tacos are amazing. Get a margarita but splitting a pitcher with one other person can be dangerous. Get the queso!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield was a fun place to celebrate my birthday!  The staff was so nice and made me feel so special. The free shots didn't hurt either. They were willing to take a reservation for a large group and were ready when we arrived. My torta was delicious and the queso was one of the best I've ever had!  The servers were attentive and friendly. Plus the decor was fun and modern. I'm excited to make a second visit to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying I DON'T EAT MEAT and so it's so hard for me to review places with a very small vegan-friendly menu. Here goes;   I like the spot in terms of vibe, I actually picked going here based on the pics here on Yelp. It's nice & clean and new.   It's busy but FAST so I bookmarked this one for an \"in a rush\" night downtown because you can eat and drink and be out in 45 or less. Amazing.   Down side? We were hoping for a romantic-ish night and it was a little too fast read: no up sell on the drinks etc...kids...loud bridge & tunnel types in for shows....not a great place to play footsie.   Food: Fair price, decent flavour. I had a salad, we had chips/guac and hubby had 3 tacos (the only 2 vegetarian types).   All in all the staff was good, service was good, food was fine...we will be back it's just not \"THE\" destination."}
{"text":"The food and margaritas are great. The atmosphere is awesome,and the staff is super friendly. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This review makes me sad and upset.  I hadn't been to this place in a long time...and now I remember why: corn tortillas only.  Why oh why do we not have an option!??  I strongly dislike corn tortillas and was extremely disappointed that they had sooo many fantastic taco options that I couldn't enjoy.   I came for the taco and left after just having a drink while my friend had tacos.  The spicy margarita is good, slightly on the sour side...like the sour mix side, but still was alright.  Very spicy!  The restaurant was a little cramped and crowded.  They were playing loud music, so it was difficult to hear anything that evening.  The service was friendly and hospitable.  Our server was extremely attentive to detail."}
{"text":"My first time here was the Yelp Taco Event and quite frankly I'm impressed. Why haven't I been here before? Why does this feel like you're temporary transported away from Pittsburgh? And what do they put in their tacos to make them taste so good? From the mixed materials used for the decor to the exposed ceilings I love the decor. It gave me this super rustic feel. The staff were also very personable. Now to the star of this place... The tacos! Specifically I fell in love with the Mahi Mahi Tacos. It's crispy, crunchy, flavorful topped with a slaw and packed with so much flavor! The slaw isn't overpowering and works really well with the Mahi Mahi. I was so upset that I was full after two of them as I wanted to eat them all day. It's also great to know that they make everything they can fresh from salsas to the corn tortillas. I can't wait to come back to try their margaritas and veggie tacos."}
{"text":"Second time in as many months my credit charge turned out to be higher than the amount on my signed receipt. In October it was on my Discover card and this month now on my AMEX. Mysteriously both times the charge was bumped upwards from the signed amount. Last month after realizing it I called and spoke with manager who was polite but then never called back. My advice is check your receipt and if possible pay with AMEX if using credit card since the process to dispute is pretty simple.  Food and drink is great though! :)."}
{"text":"Anticlimatic.  $10 for a glass of cheap cab?  I won't be rushing back. That is for sure."}
{"text":"Went last week. Great tacos with a simple yet flavorful menu. They do tacos right. Good for groups and great cocktails too. Check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Sunday was my third visit to Bakersfield and loved each dining experience. I haven't explored more of the menu other than the Guacamole, salsa and tacos and of course the Margaritas. All are excellent!  My favorite is the Cochinta Pibil taco ..Love, love the explosion of flavors!!!  Front door and service were spot on each visit.  A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I've been several times now. It's a bar and restaurant and when it is really crowded, they open the downstairs for more seating and there is an additional bar. The restaurant's ambiance is really nice as well.   The food is so good. Order the chips and queso, it's definitely worth it. They give a huge pile of chips with it and it costs $6. I've been meaning to try the chorizo queso, but that's for next time. I highly recommend the tacos, specifically the fish tacos. They are $4 each but worth it. Every time I go I have to order their fish tacos. They also have seasonal margaritas, currently it is clementine hibiscus I believe. My boyfriend said it was very good, but it comes in a small mason jar. It costs $10  so its up to you if you believe that's worth it.   Service was friendly but the last time I was here, it was a little slow and we were wondering where our waitress was.   All in all, I highly recommend to go!"}
{"text":"I love this place first time here. Food and atmosphere was great. Was a little packed I waited 45 min for a table with my friends in the mean time we ordered a pitcher of margaritas to share. Holy cow they were amazing!!!! Danielle came over to us quickly with water she helped us pick out tacos and appetizers because we had no clue what to get.Best tacos and guacamole I ever had. She was funny and cracking jokes with us all night. The entire staff did a great job I will be back I love this place."}
{"text":"Where else can you go have margs and guac while watching old westerns? Sat at the bar on Saturday around noon to kick off a day of bar hopping. Our group of 4 ordered the Bakersfield margarita pitcher and were all very pleased. It's about 6 glasses for $36. They fill up a mason jar 3/4 of the way with tequila and then top it off with triple sec. The only thing better than having margaritas is having chips and delicious guacamole with margaritas. Also really enjoyed the bottles of salsa they serve with the warm tortilla chips! We didn't order any tacos this time because we already had lunch plans for later on, but we plan on returning next time we visit Charlotte because they sounded delicious! My mouth waters every time I see the pictures posted by other Yelpers. Loved the atmosphere at this american style mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. Each time I've been here (twice) I have had a great experience. Yesterday we came for a fun Friday night out on the town. The wait was 3 hours. LOLZ. Yeah right we said and thought about leaving but then we found a little slab of a table by the bar! Success!! We plopped down with two chairs for two of us and the other two stood. We buckled in to prepared for some fun.  Appetizers: CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE: Yum. The guacamole was very fresh with just a little amount of extras in it. We got it because our waitress said they might be running out and there was no way we wanted to miss this. Some bites had hits of spice to it but nothing overwhelming.  CHIPS AND SALSA: The green salsa was my favorite. The other salsa was red and had a smokier flavor to it. It was good but not as good as that green salsa.   We were munching on chips and decided to order drinks. Since there were four of us we were like, \"why not a pitcher!!\" One person out of the group decided that he would rather have the spicy marg so three of us split the pitcher.   Drinks: SPICY MARGARITA: El Jimador Blanco, triple sec, agave nectar, fresh lemon/lime, fresh fresno/jalapeno. Let me tell you this margarita packed a kick! It was spicy going down and had a spicy after taste too it. Wowie! I would not order this again but if you are adventurous then this is the drink for you!  THE BAKERSFIELD MARGARITA: El Jimador Blanco, triple sec, agave nectar, fresh lemon/lime. I don't like tequila but I liked this drink. It wasn't sweet, like fake syrup sweet, and had just enough tartness to it to make you pucker a bit. I always get mine without the salt rim. They were great. The price was a bit expensive but for three people to split it wasn't bad.   Tacos: (Can I also say these are served in CORN tortillas!!!) FISH: crispy mahi, tabasco lime sauce, citrus slaw, cilantro. Fish tacos are my jam. I love nothing more than a crispy fish taco. This one did not disappoint at all. It was awesome. The fish was a large portion to cover the 4 inch corn tortilla. The slaw was good too! I sometimes add a little bit of the green salsa to this taco. I think that it needs just a little bit more. It is still good as is but I like to spice it up!   MOLE: oaxacan style braised chicken, pickled red onion, queso fresco, cilantro. The pickled red onions are AMAZING. When I come here I ask for a side of them.....Because I love onions and I am crazy like that. This taco had succulent chicken that you need your napkin because the juice will run down your hand! The chicken is juicy and flavorful, a great combination. I would really suggest getting this taco! Yumm...  I would say that if you come here be prepared for either a wait or to sit at the bar. I know that is usually not my favorite thing but the food and service sometimes makes it worth it. I hope that Bakersfield will start allowing reservations, that would be great! But until then: come early, come often, and come hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is a great hangout. Darrell is awesome and friendly bartender. Best I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Such  divine tacos! We had a large group for a bachelorette party and our server, London, was amazing. We were able to do the group meal (only for parties over 6 people) which had chips, guacamole, salsa and quest, a big salad and 5 different types of tacos (about 3 tacos per person) for just $15 each. Amazing deal"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Bakersfield is hard to top. Relaxed and casual yet sophisticated and trendy, the indoor/outdoor space will be amazing for the summer! All the food and drink prices are about 20% more than you'd pay at your average Mexican restaurant but along the same prices as the rest of Ohio City. The margarita pitcher is definitely worth it, it lasted a lot longer than you'd think. We tried the house lime and seasonal pineapple and they were both delicious and the flavor was perfect, not sweet with natural fruit flavor and a hint of tequila coming threw. The guacamole was also exceptional, definitely house made. The salsas and tacos were also extremely delicious but didn't knock me off my feet like the Margarita and guac. All the people we encountered, the host, bartender and waitress were all exceptionally nice and attentive, I've never encountered a restaurant were the people were so friendly across the board. I look forward to many summer nights here but I do foresee ridiculous crowds, so I'll probably shoot for the weekdays!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Bakersfield and it was a good experience overall. We arrived around 5PM on a Thursday in the summer and our party of five was seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly and helpful in describing the menu and offering recommendations for food and drinks. Our drinks came quickly.   I ordered an entree salad and all the others in our group ordered tacos. The tacos came out on a big tray in a reasonable time frame due to how busy the restaurant had gotten. However, my salad didn't come out for another ten minutes or so. I wasn't too bothered by the delay but someone else immediately came over and apologized. She said she would be taking the salad off my bill because \"they do not like food to come out like that to a table\". I was really impressed by this, especially since it really wasn't that long of a delay and I didn't even have to say something to them. Plus, the salad (The Willie) was DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend going to Bakersfield for your next taco fix!"}
{"text":"Bakersfield East Blvd was on my bookmarked list. Unfortunately, it was average. The highlights were the guacamole and salsa. The lowlights were the actual meal, the tacos. The salsa was green, which was unique. Fresh, but not too spicy. They could bottle the salsa and sell it on its own. I had the steak taco, the al pastor, and the fish taco. The fish taco was so busy that I could hardly taste the fish. The al pastor had very fatty, chewy meat, and the steak taco isn't memorable so I can't tell you about it.   There was very little crowd, to be expected on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar to eat and the service was good. The bartender answered all of our questions and was prompt. It didn't take long for food to arrive. Food was hot and served on one large platter. Overall, I thought that Bakersfield was just okay. If you're looking for tacos, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and sat at the bar.  Met a couple of people from out of town and had a good time with our new friends.  The atmosphere is the usual latest style of rough wood and a little dark.  Music was playing and it was to loud. The bar tenders were a little busy but seem to ignore us and the people next to us.  He had to flag them down for any request, found this strange. Ordered the Chorizo chili...No...We are out of that.  OK, back to the drawing board on what to order.  We decided to start with some chips and salsa.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa, not as salty as many places. Ordered the Cochinita Pibil and the Short Rib taco.  Both were very good but a bit on the small side, smallest I have seen at a restaurant or street stand.  The tacos were very good.  Liked both.  The short rib was my favorite."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the hustle of West 25 street, not to mention an Ohio based company that started out of Cincinnati, is a cozy and trendy Mexican restaurant that will bring in people from near and far. With a trendy interior design, they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The bathrooms are located by the kitchen and feel free to add your personal touch by writing on the walls, make your mark.  The simplistic, yet diversified menu, offers many options for meat lovers alike, with minimal choices for vegetarians. The mahi taco tasted phenomenal, but heavily topped with slaw that needed lightened. Personally, I despise the rubber like flour tacos, but the fish was prepared to liking. Ask for a fork ahead of time because both mine and a friends came apart almost instantaneously. On the flip side, the medium spicy salsa out-tasted the verde. Big no no, don't say yes when they ask if you want to try both. I didn't realize I was going to be charged twice, unbeknownst to me until I saw my check..  With minimal options on margarita pitcher mixes, the classic Bakersfield choice was relatively good, leaving four others as possible choices. I personally did enjoy it, but it was nothing over the top to be memorable. Good thing, you can never go wrong with the basic margarita. To note, they have simplistic happy hour options to enjoy that are posted on a board, but not your traditional options. Only shots and domestic beer options are available, nothing relating to food...bummer. BUT, all food is under 10 bucks, yay to them!!!  Overall, a nice touch to the already bustling street, be sure to find a street parking spot or uber, unsure of where the best place to park would be. Whether you come for lunch or dinner, come take a seat, sip on a margarita and dive into the savory tacos to fill you in all of the right ways. I can't wait to see how this place evolves over time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Customer service. Phenomenal food. Awesome drink specials. Location is perfect. Place is clean and staff is welcoming. Manager is very nice. What more could you ask for? When I ordered I got the Milanese sandwich and it was the bomb. Will be coming back more!   If you don't like authentic tacos this place may not be for you. They do have other food items."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. I love the food and my god the margarita pitchers... But. It's set up to be more of a bar, getting a table could take over an hour Thursday-Saturday. Not enough tables and too many people set up at a table and stay for hours just drinking. Which only frustrates me because it's a good place. But it does keep me from attempting to go there on the weekends."}
{"text":"Quality, authentic Mexican food. The tacos are excellent and he atmosphere is great. I'm from out of town and recommend Bakersfield to anyone visiting Charlotte. My friends in town eat here all the time"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we grew up in Cleveland and wanted to see what the city is like now. Great young place, we're older but want our city to be alive with the young. We are young at heart. Pleasant afternoon stopped for a margarita and chips. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I can be a little tough on Tex-Mex restaurants being of Mexican heritage. This is no exception. While the food is somewhat tasty, it's not authentic and their spin isn't a surprise. But, the service was incredible and the drinks were good."}
{"text":"Overpriced and subpar. Barrio and Barroco are way better. Our server was super nice though. The tacos were pretty lacking in flavor and there were just odd combinations that didn't fit together. I got a seasonal margarita and was instantly slapped in the face with allspice. It was just weird. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the services but the food and drinks were just meh at best."}
{"text":"I was here for late night drinks this visit, but have been here numerous times and will continue to go. Somehow my friends and I always seem to end up at Bakersfield. Normally there is a spot at the bar. If you want something a little bit more secluded, the downstairs bar is a great option so make sure to check if that is open.   Their margaritas are always fantastic. My friends and I usually opt for the spicy margarita or just the Bakersfield Margarita. Their food is also great. The tacos are not my absolute favorite (proportion to price ratio)  but by no means are they bad or would I ever not go back. I just usually opt to go for drink and chips and salsa, which is so good and why we usually start or end here.   The atmosphere is wonderful and a great place to hang out. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday, got a few tacos and chips and salsa. Warm tortilla chips came with a nice mild red salsa. The spicy green salsa was really tasty though (it wasn't very spicy though, maybe a medium level). Got the Al Pastor, fish, short rib, and braised pork tacos. Very fresh and flavorful ingredients. Service was great, very quick. Great place for tacos. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"If I could marry a taco, I seriously would. I'm obsessed with tacos, and how could one blame me? Hell, I might even love tacos more than I love my sister.  But anyway, I ended up here on the recommendation of my friend after the concert I attended ended prematurely (boo). Being that It was after ten, the place was pretty empty except for the bar area. I was greeted by one of the bar tenders and ordered my beer. From there I had to decided which of the delicious tacos I was about to enjoy. I ended up ordering the Mahi and the bistec. While the steak was pretty good and the chipotle slaw complimented it well, I really fell in love with the fish. It was the perfect amount of crispy (i love things to be crispy), the citrus slaw complimented the fish very well, and the tabasco lime sauce brought something to the taco that I definitely never had before. Go for the fish you wont regret it!  The guys beside me had the chorizo chili. It smelled like heaven and they each said it was fantastic, can't wait to try it!   The bar also has ports to charge your phone, and hooks to hang your bags! That is definitely a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner celebration. It was packed but we had reservations (make them!) so we were able to sit pretty quickly. Our server ROCKED. Knew everything about the menu and had awesome recommendations. She was attentive, energetic and easy going. Ordered several tacos and queso. Tacos were great! Flavorful and good sized. It was a bit loud but it was a Friday night, people were having a good time."}
{"text":"If it's yummy Mexican food you are in the mood for - this ain't your place. But if you want a cool spot to drink and enjoy small-ish plates with, then I recommend Bakersfield. Let me break this down:  Parking - I was meeting some friends there and because I read on Yelp that parking was crazy, I got there a little bit early. I easily found a spot on the street (as did one of my friends). However, another one of my friends had a harder time finding parking. I think management is going to have to figure something out with parking (especially since valet is only after 6 pm) in order to make it manageable for people to come here. I would give parking 2 stars.  Drinks - I had the sangria and really liked it. It was fruity and sweet. One of my friends had the margarita and liked it. I would give drinks 5 stars.  Queso - we had the queso with chorizo, black beans, and jalapenos. It was awesome! My one friend commented that the chorizo made it kind of salty, but I didn't eat much with chorizo so I don't know. The chips were delicious, although I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (but, again, this is NOT a normal Mexican restaurant). I give appetizer a 4.  Tostadas- I had the tostada that had potatoes on it. I can't think of much good to say. There was a massive clump of chunky guacamole. I like guac but that didn't save this dish. It was super dry and I would not recommend it. The waitress offered to get me something else, which I declined (although she still charged me for it, eventhough I didn't really eat it). I give the tostada a 1 star.  Short Rib Taco - this was delicious! I am not normally a fan of radishes but I left the sliver of radish on there and it was tasty. The tacos come on corn tortillas (which I like), so don't expect the soft texture of a flour tortilla. The only think that would have made this taco even better would have been some sort of sauce to pour on it. I give this taco 4 stars.  Overall, I like this spot. Is it my favorite place in Dilworth? No. Will I go again? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Excellent street tacos, albeit a  bit pricy if you have a big appetite. Good beer and drink selection and the service is always great. Great salsas as well to compliment the food.  I have gone here several times and have been happy. The biggest complaint is the general noise level: it is loud in both seating areas. It makes it difficult to have a quiet conversation as a result.  The crowd is consistently trendy, business casual, young professional, and millennial. The environment is relaxed, but like I said, after people around you have had a few drinks, be prepared to raise your voice to talk to whomever you are with."}
{"text":"This place has unexpectedly good tacos and plenty of room. Also runs late night."}
{"text":"Ooh! These are some tasty tacos. We stopped in for dinner at a pretty happenin' joint. This is no place for kids, but I didn't care. I took my kids right in, despite all the stares from childless 20 somethings. We were seated within 30 seconds and our waitress seemed happy to be serving a nuclear family for once. She was extremely friendly to us.  We started off with some chips and queso along with some guacamole. It was all the tasty. I polished off most of that yummy guac and ordered the three most popular tacos - fish, chicken, and short rib. My favorite was the fish taco. I found that the tacos had a vinegar theme to them, which was tasty. My wife loved the tacos, even more than Bomba, But I still hold Bomba in a higher regard as the vinegar undertone, while tasty, isn't my favorite flavor profile.  The quality of the food, drink, and service are excellent. Will we be back? Probably not. It's not our scene. They did have a kids menu though and my son gobbled up some chicken tenders, which he liked."}
{"text":"Here is another average Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Bakersfield has decent margaritas, but I am not a fan of their tacos. The tortilla was consistently dry, although they did seem that the tacos has an interesting flavor. Also, I didn't quite understand why they needed to go with a southern vibe for this restaurant. Ultimately, this place deserves a 3 because it is in an interesting part of Downtown and offers decent mixed drinks."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I've been back a couple of times and the service has been better. But more importantly, the General Manager reached out to me and we had a great conversation about my concern. I believe she's working to fix the issue, which is great, because the food, the drinks, and the overall atmosphere are wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Bakersfield and it turned out to be a great weekday lunch spot.  We were a little late for the lunch rush, so we got to talk a little more with our server who was just lovely.  She talked to us about the different margaritas and we ended up going with the Premium Margaritas and they were delightful.  Nothing better than a margarita that doesn't come from a mix!  The guacamole and salsas were fantastic, and we each had two tacos to round out the meal.  I went with the fish taco and short rib taco and neither one left me feeling disappointed.  Overall the food was great, our server was even better, and the only downside would be that I could imagine it gets VERY loud during prime dining hours.  But if you're looking for an alternative to a sandwich spot for lunch, definitely check out Bakersfield, it was exacty what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Loved it ! !  I love sexy food!  ! Please try this place ..  you will not be disappointed !  !"}
{"text":"A group of gals and I decided Bakersfield was going to be our destination to celebrate one of the girls birthday's this past Monday evening.  Since they don't take reservations we weren't sure how easy it would be for a party of 6 to get seats - but were pleasantly surprised it was SUPER easy to get seats.    While waiting for our entire party to arrive - we decided to order guacamole, salsa and chips.  Phenomenal choice!  The chips came out warm - the 2 salsa choices (smokey and per our waitress the one so refreshing you'll want to take a bath in it!) were great!  We also decided to get started on the drinks.  Margaritas were appropriately the drink of choice!  There is a great selection of tacos available.  Personally tried the pork belly and bistec.  The pork belly was - hands down - my favorite.  I did take a little bit of the pinapple off as it's not my favorite, but still enjoyed a bit of it.  The bistec - was quite heated - so be aware.  But still quite good.  All the other tacos looked fantastic.  I look forward to trying the others on some additional visits.  I look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"If you're a taco lover like me, Bakersfield is a must try in the Cleveland area. We couldn't decide whether to order salsa, queso or guac so naturally we ordered all three! Their guac is on the chunkier side which I was a huge fan of because there were big hunks of avocado in every bite. The queso was a blend of cheeses that were baked - not your usual creamy queso but still delicious nonetheless. If you're a lover of cheese I wouldn't pass this one up. Bakersfield serves their salsa in squeeze bottles which was fun, there was a spicy smoky variety and a sweeter version made from tomatillos. Since all the staters were delicious I made the classic mistake of filling up on chips and salsa. I had to take a breather before the tacos came so we sampled the grapefruit and pineapple margaritas - these tasted like a vacation in a glass! Also worth mentioning, I'm a huge Diet Coke fan and I loved that they had Coca-Cola from Mexico. It has a different flavor because it's sweetened with cane sugar vs. high fructose corn syrup - it was fun to try and really does taste different! FINALLY the tacos. It was cool that they were all served family-style. We ordered a nice selection from the menu and all the ones I tried really blew me away. I personally had the Pollo Rojo, Al Pastor, and the Bistec. They were all really flavorful and I was a fan of the tortillas that are handmade in house. I would definitely come back here to eat. Well done!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places.  My friend Jenn and I stopped here on a Friday after work.  I met her at the bar on the lower level.  The atmosphere is very rustic with Western movies playing on the TVs.    We split an order of chips and salsa, while I ordered the chicken chipotle tostada and mole taco and Jenn ordered the short rib torta and pork belly pastor taco.  The two house salsas -one red, one green - were excellent and I liked how I could use as much as I wanted.  The green salsa had come with our chips so I kept refilling it.  The chicken chipotle tostada is a meal in itself and was amazing with the red salsa.  The mole taco also had a good amount of flavor.  Jenn's short rib torta was also good.  She wasn't expecting it to be as big as it was and actually ended up taking half of it home.  The pork belly taco was good, as well.        The price point is right here.  Every food item on the menu is under $10.  I spent about $25 for a decent amount of food AND a sangria.  My word.  Try doing that almost anywhere else in town that's not a pizza joint.  We'll be back...tomorrow, actually."}
{"text":"I'm not joking they have literally the best margarita!!! We decided to try the chips with guacamole, queso and salsa. The guac was my favorite for sure, the cheese was a close second. The cheese was unlike any other queso I have tried before, different but very yummy! I'm not a fan of spice so I cannot comment on the salsa, but everyone else seemed to be enjoying both of them. We tried about all of the tacos between us. Maybe a little too much cilantro, but that's just me. Everyone was happy!  I must say, the staff was so friendly professional, fun and energetic, that alone will make me want to go back. The black beans were great but our server, Beans was the best addition to our dinner. I wish she was able to sit down and hangout with us we all loved her so much! Jeff the general manager, made sure we were happy and I saw him walking around making sure everyone was having as great of a time as we were!  I appreciate they don't say 'Mexican' they strictly say -- tacos, tequila! I like that !   Get there now!!!"}
{"text":"Barrio you have met your match. This place is good...real real good. Tried a variety of their tacos, their braised beef tostado with a fried egg which was my favorite and their homemade guac. Yum yum yum. Also tried their seasonal pineapple margarita also very tasty. Restraunt has a nice atmosphere and service was great. Definitely a must try. Can't wait to go back, sorry Barrio not sorry."}
{"text":"I come here every other week and the food quality is always the same and incredible whenever I am here. The bartenders and serve-staff are incredibly friendly, instinctive, predicting, and fast. They always know if I am close to low on a beer and offer another and recognize me as a customer. Very warm and friendly environment. Great to meet for friends, a date, or by yourself. I typically get the chips and salsa with a side of guacamole and their fish tacos. Great subtle flavors that aren't crazy overpowering. Their mixed drinks are fantastic too. Definitely a favorite in the Ohio City area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here early on a Friday night and was seated right away. My friend and I started off with margaritas and chips and guac. The margarita was quality. The chips and guac were pretty average. We were also given two salsas to try. For the tacos, I had the fish taco and a current special, the shrimp taco. All the tacos are served open faced. The fish taco was delicious. The fish was perfect and tasted great with the crisp slaw. The shrimp taco was also very good. Their tacos are on the smaller side, so you can definitely eat 2-3. My friend loved the huitlacoche. Overall, a nice place to grab some tacos and drinks in downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late night tacos the other week and got Ariana as a bar tender. One of the best spots in the city. She really knew the menu and the fish tacos were amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent mini sized \"street\" tacos!  We stopped in for a late afternoon lunch and \"Wow\"--I'm sure glad we picked Bakersfield!  I tried four tacos (the shrimp, fish, al pastor and a pork carnitas special).  All four were absolutely delicious, and even impressed my fellow out-of-towner AND our companion Pittsburgh native that had never heard of this place, both of whom were a tad skeptical when I picked the restaurant (thanks, Yelp, for making me a restaurant selecting pro yet again!).  I would absolutely recommend the al pastor taco, which was awesome, and portobello taco was also a table favorite, though I cannot personally vouch for it.  We also tried the queso topped with jalapeños, which was a perfect sized app for our party of three.  Our waiter was helpful and hyped our food selections, assuring us we had ordered well."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for happy hour and some tacos. Margaritas are so good! The fish taco is my favorite by far, but with each taco being $4 or so, you can try a few. The bartender was great - introduced himself personally to us since we said it was our first time. Got there around 430 but within an hour, the place was packed! Really cool ambience and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!!  Margarita: A+  Guacamole: A++  Al pastor tacos: A+++  All around excellent and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Who knew you could strip a pierogi and turn the shell into a taco shell?  So co-workers arranged for a going away party for one of our dearest employees who is moving on to another job, and because of its close proximity, Bakersfield was chosen. Knowing that we all don't earn very much, it's kind of hard to understand WHY they chose one of the pricier places in the neighborhood, but there ya go.  We arrived at what was supposed to be an hour into the event, and we could find none of our group. Not upstairs, nor downstairs, and no one, including one other former employee that found us, knew anything about where this gathering was, so we opted to wait at the bar until it could be figured out.   I had no idea that a taco place would be quite so 'country' themed, but when it came down to it, it was much more 'Tex' than Tex-Mex' anyway. Some of the food was called the 'Willie' and the 'Loretta'. YEE-HA!  The music was loud, which made the rest of the atmosphere loud. Loud music and people yelling at each other. The bartender, who was actually very cool, and a bit gifted in the mixology department, asked what we wanted to drink. The special was the Bakersfield Margarita, and I am not a fan of Tequila at all, unless it's being sung by Son Of Dave, Tape Five or The Manhattan Transfer. My better half had one, and I ordered a Manhattan, which I should NOT have done on an empty stomach. The bartender, a guy probably in his mid to late 40's, silver bearded, said that I would not get a Manhattan like this from anyone else in the place.  It was STRONG, and almost SO 'fancy' that I didn't recognize it as a Manhattan, and on the empty stomach it took about one 'finger' to go to my head. But the 'not quite recognized as' theme carried through to the food.  My better half ordered a Pollo (POY-yo - which is chicken) Taco from the special taco menu, and I ordered the Cubano sandwich, or as they called it, Torta. Just after I placed my order, my better half's 'taco' came. A $4 taco. It was truly so tiny that it literally looked like they'd split open a pierogi, scraped out the stuffing, and then topped the pierogi dough with some taco stuff. It was very flavorful, according to my better half, but for $4? Totally not worth buying. It definitely didn't serve at a meal, and barely as an appetizer. And definitely not enough to counter a strong Margarita.  Another former employee came by, and we discovered that our gathering was hiding in a back corner, so we moved to that area before the sandwich arrived, and it was delivered back there.  Now, I lived in Miami, and I know what a Cubano is in terms of the sandwich. Also called a 'Medianoche' (May-dee-ah-NO-chay - which means 'midnight') it is a common late night post drinking binge nosh, rather like Primanti's. Well, this sandwich at Bakersfield was NO Medianoche, but it's okay that they call it a Cubano. It really was very good, with delicious and kicky toppings, and a wonderful side chipotle sauce. It was ten bucks, but a decent size.  So, for a Manhattan, a Margarita, a toy taco the size of an unfolded pierogi, and an actual sandwich, the bill came to just over $40.  The bartender was awesome, and the staff were all helpful and courteous. I just can't say I'd make any kind of return trip. Too expensive, tacos totally not worth the price, and so loud that you could not have a normal conversation without pressing your mouth to someone's ear, or flat out yell-talking.  But seriously...the tacos...there are several Mexican options downtown, and Tex-Mex. With such competition so nearby, why the tiny tacos? There wasn't even ROOM on the shell for more than a heaping tablespoon of 'stuff'. This is kind of a need to go BIGGER or go HOME kind of thing.   I do give points for the Cubano though. And one final pronunciation, and a good thing to remember for spitting out the Spanish language. All of the vowels in the Spanish language only have ONE sound  A - Ah E - eh I - ee O - oh U - ooh (like eww, not 'ohhhh')  Coo-BAH-no.   Not Cue-BAN-oh..."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!!! What is wrong with me!  I've been here several times, the first and best time was for a little celebration my friends and I had. We got the round booth in the basement area and had the best servers. I don't remember exactly what we ordered, I think between us we tried almost everything on the menu, including the cocktails.   One friend of mine is a tequila connoisseur and the server was able to rattle off details about everything they had!   The tacos and sides were quite tasty. As were the drinks. The jalapeño margarita was my favorite. That, I remember haha.   I've been there on other occasions, just to grab a drink, always in the basement, it's got a cooler vibe than upstairs, imo. Just be careful that often times the basement women's room is broken or floods lol."}
{"text":"Wow, love this place. We came at 7p on a Satuday night expecting a wait. It was a 2 hour wait, but went down to the bar area and almost right away got a standing table for 6. perfect! Ordered Guac (AMAZING!) and the queso (DOUBLE AMAZING). The queso is not the watery mess most places pass off, this is thick and creamy and well, amazing! Tacos, we had the fish and they were fantastic! Love this place. The staff was ok, friendly, not super quick, but it was very busy. Overall LOVE it!"}
{"text":"The variety here is fantastic. Lots of options for tacos with a good choice of seafood options and options that aren't at other places. The taco salad is well worth the price. I really liked the specials here- it seems they like to change things up but the regular menu has plenty of choices as well. We didn't try the margaritas yet but will come back. There are a lot of unique choices for drinks as well. Cool atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Wow.  Waited 30 minutes for chips and salsa.  Never got our Tacos, we ordered 6 total at 9pm on a Tuesday.  The restaurant was not busy.  Left without any dinner.  I honestly can't even give a worse review.  The margaritas we're pre-mix.  Very disappointing.   There are so many wonderful restaurants in this city.  Don't waste your time or money on this one, what a shame."}
{"text":"Update: The management here is excellent and if there is anything you dislike they will try their best to accommodate you if they are notified.   Waitress: India  Music Playlist Type: Act Naturally by Buck Owens  When entering there is a distinct must odor (think entering the elevator with someone who prefers not to wear deodorant) but luckily your nose adjusts and, after you're seated for awhile, its no longer noticeable. Ask for their full draft menu otherwise they will only share PBR.  I would definitely recommend the chips and guacamole. The chips are salted perfectly and the guac seems fresh and seasoned just right, a small amount of spice that blends well w the chips. You can tell the waiter whether you want red or green salsa otherwise the will bring you green as the default.   I got 3 tacos (short rib, steak and chicken). The chicken was the most flavorful but i didn't enjoy any of them. The corn tortilla shells left my mouth extremely dry.   We had to ask another waitress for our chips after 10 min of waiting for a refill."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, and I try to avoid chains, but THAT GUAC THO. The guacamole is addicting, its so delicious. There are chunks of avocado in it, and it's very flavorful. Also the chips to guac ratio is pretty good.  Go for drinks and chips/guac and you won't regret it. The red sangria is very good. Also, PBR is always on special for $3 and it comes in a boot glass. As for the other food I've had, it's decent, nothing has blown me away yet. It does get busy at times, but there is an additional bar downstairs."}
{"text":"Over priced. $8 for a margarita that's the size of the ones at Barrio and taste like they have the booze. Tacos were bland, I could do a better job myself."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and got this great recommendation from a former Pittsburgher and they nailed it. Great prices, awesome drinks, and tasty food. Tyler, our server was very helpful and friendly. We left completely satisfied and nicely buzzed. We got several different tacos and each one had a distinct flavor to it. I will be coming back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"What can I say, I just think it's a perfect place for this area and another great addition to an already great food/drink community in Ohio city. Tex Mex and a great trendy environment. So what did I get? For drinks pitcher of the spicy margarita, and for app I got the queso cooked in cherry with chorizo and jalapeño( taste almost like a beer cheese) amazing loved that. And the kicker the short ribs... get it! I got the torta which is a hot sandwich and I would get it again."}
{"text":"Bakersfield Penn Ave  Awesome Mexican restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh!  Nice comfy seating, cool modern decor and friendly service!    Their guacamole is nice and chunky and the queso dip comes in a hot iron mini pan.  Not quite sizzling but browned cheese on top.... yums!  Unfortunately don't serve root beer but they do have Mexican Coke with real sugar  not artificial sweetener.    The tacos were great too.  Loved the braised pork and the mahi-mahi fish taco (they have mahi in Pittsburgh :).  The steak taco was flavorful and good but I like my meat thinly sliced.  Overall you can't lose here!  Great food!  Great value and nicely and smartly decorated.    Did I say I loved the guac?"}
{"text":"Suggested by the concierge at a local hotel and I was not disappointed--only surprised that this fabulous Mexican restaurant has a name that ...doesn't make me think of tacos, tortas, salsa, etc.!  My server was Lukas, who was great!  I told him what kind of Mexican fare I liked (I lived and worked in Mexico for a year), and a few types of tacos I had never tried (fish!).  His suggestions were perfect!  I tried the mahi taco (amazing--and I can say that was the first fish tacos I ever tried--in Steel City!), as well as the Baja Shrimp taco, and another Hongos.  All three different flavors, and all superb.  Their salsa verde is wonderful as well.  AND... I'm sure their regular 'Ritas are great, but I ordered Herradura Silver, Cuantro and their homemade mix.  I will not be back in the area for a few months, but I will DEFINITELY come back.  Service, food, drinks, location--wonderful.  Thank you for a great treat."}
{"text":"Very fast service and very friendly staff. If you're a picky eater this place isn't for you. The food was fresh and everything was great just wasn't my style of food or my taste. The guac was amazing though!"}
{"text":"Took a group of colleagues here for drinks and dinner. It was a Friday so there was a 45-50 minute wait for our group - totally understandable. Went to the downstairs bar where we received good service and quality drinks. After an hour wait, we went upstairs for dinner and were seated at a table with benches. I had the shredded beef tostada and it was very good. Everyone enjoyed the dinner and the atmosphere, which I would call upscale casual. The service at dinner was friendly and attentive. I'd recommend this for a group because the dinner choices seem to have a bit of something for everyone. Strongly recommend pitchers of margaritas as well as the fresh guacamole. Guac Tip: Two orders were perfect for six people."}
{"text":"I love that they always have a $3 shot special. Did I really just have $3 Bulleit?!  The Guac is amazing and not as expensive as other places. The two salsas are also delicious and you won't be able to stop eating them! The red one is spicy and the green one is unlike any other green salsa I've had. So good.   2-3 tacos and you're set! I like the short rib and the fish taco. They also have good vegetarian options.   They always have a seasonal margarita and this should not be overlooked. The Rosemary watermelon margarita in the summer was my favorite summer drink! I even tried to recreate it (to no avail). I just had their fall spiced apple margarita and it was yummy as well.   Service has always been good even when they are busy.   Parking is really my only beef. It is available but hard to find and I'm always worried I could be towed. They have valet, but I feel bad I never have cash.   They are doing so many things right, which continues to make me a customer."}
{"text":"Loved the feel of this place.   We ordered the queso with chorizo and I got a side of black beans. Very good I thought it tasted better with the beans but no one else at the table wanted them.  We ordered a variety of tacos, but best hands down is the pork belly with pinnapple. The pineapple is so sweet and mixes well with the pork. Other tacos pollo rojo (tasted more like ropa vieja), bistec was good and tender but lacking a bit of flavor but easily fixed with the green salsa they place on the table which is delicious.  The atmosphere was great inside. They were lacking on wait staff though we waited almost 25 minutes waiting for our check to come to the table. But other than that, it's a place to check out."}
{"text":"Yes! So maybe it wasn't the best tex mex I've ever had but still I loved this place. We went on. Tuesday night at 9 and it was pretty packed. It's a cool open atmosphere and I'm sure people go there to hang out and drink but since my husband and I don't do alcohol we go places to eat. They were fast and efficient and our waitress was on top of it even though she clearly had lots of other tables. We didn't wait at all. What a cool place. The only bad thing as with all places in that area is parking, ugh"}
{"text":"Was not a fan to be honest. Went because someone said it was good. I had a hair in my drink which they took care of and I did not pay for it and really was not a fan of the tacos I got the pork and it was very dry I won't return."}
{"text":"Pleasant upscalish but casual bar on Penn Ave, close to the convention center, which serves extremely tiny tacos that are artfully prepared. I wasn't so keen on the short ribs taco (which sounded better than it is) but it was an A for concept, at least, and the fish taco was great, with nice combinations of unusual ingredients. Nice bites. They have local brews on tap and service was prompt and friendly, and the Tequila of the Day is $3. Not bad. A touch pricey, and I wouldn't go there hunting for high end haute or authentic Mexican food, but as far as fake Americanized Mexican bar food, well above average."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive: the atmosphere is pretty cool here with tons of people all seeming to enjoy themselves (Friday night). The servers, while nice, were busy (at the bar) and inattentive. We actually wanted a second drink but after waiting 15 minutes with empty glasses we decided to just close out. The plain margarita was made from fresh juices and was delish at first, but ended up tasting too heavy and sweet.   The food: average at best. The queso, while nice and thick, tasted floury and was impossible to pick up using a chip. We got three different tacos and were equally unimpressed with them - while nothing tasted bad, I don't care if I ever have them again. Fish was missing something, the pork belly pastor was overcooked and tough and the short rib was unexpectedly spicy. Cilantro was a heavy addition.   We're not dying to return."}
{"text":"I was here recently with some friends for a mid-week drink and it was nice. The atmosphere is reminiscent of an old western and their house margaritas are really good! They offer a myriad of authentic Mexican tacos (think soft corn shell, strip steak, lime etc) but what's confusing is that you pay $4 thinking you're going to get more than one taco, but it's quite literally just ONE taco...and my friends and I all ordered different tacos but they all came out on the same plate... it was weird and we were kind of put off by it but beggars can't be choosers and we were looking for somewhere to continue our Tuesday night outing late night and t was the only place still open at 11pm. I would definitely go back now that I know how to order off the menu."}
{"text":"Texmex at it's finest. The tacos and tostados are amazing. Good margaritas as well. I am hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6 so we were easily seated.  Fun, young, hip vibe.  I had the Paloma cocktail which was refreshing. My friend has the special margarita with fresh pineapple.  She was thrown off by the chili salt rim but she doesn't like spice anyway.  We ordered tacos (2 fish, 2 short rib for her 1 fish, 1 special spicy mahi mahi and 1 special shrimp for me.  We had guacamole and chips to start.  I found the corn tortillas to be a bit flimsy but the fish taco was the most balanced of those we tried.  The wait staff was very attentive - to check on our drinks, to ask if we wanted a refill and to bring water when requested, to check if we were satisfied w/our meal and at least 2 more times.  It is LOUD when it filled up about an hour later.  All in all, it was nice - around $65 for what we ordered."}
{"text":"Took me a while to finally make my way to Bakersfield on East, that opened a few months ago, but happy I made it.  The location is challenged, in part due to his checkered past of poor restaurants, but namely because of an abysmal parking situation.  With valet parking available at the evening, I opted for nearby parking across the street at Harris Teeter for the quick walk over.    Firstly, they did a phenoninal job on the remodel.  The restaurants-past are barely visible when looking at the new layout.  Kudos.  Secondly, the food.  By all measures, a very simple menu, but extremely well executed with fresh ingredients.  The service matches the approachable and easy-going feel for the restaurant.  Dare I say, this one might actually make it in this location?  I give Bakersfield 4 starts for a good vibe, good food and great guac.  Repeat visit on the horizon."}
{"text":"SO IMPRESSED. This is an Ohio City must! I've already been there 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Firstly, the ambiance and decor are on point. Whether you're looking to have a fun girls-night-out on a weekend, a trendy dinner date or just a quick lunch, Bakersfield is the place to be. It's fun, flirty and flavorful!  I've tried spicy mahi, baja shrimp (GET THIS ONE!!), pollo rojo, short rib, cochinita.. basically all of them and they're all very flavorful. The corn tortilla makes the experience all the much better. The short rib torta was also amazing. But my absolute FAVORITE was teh queso. If I could have an IV of that queso flowing through my veins, I would be happy for the rest of my life! The spicy margarita was killer and everyone at my table was completely satisfied with their meals. I know I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not necessarily giving the 5 stars for the food (which I'd give 4.5 stars) or the atmosphere (which I'd give 4.5 stars), but mostly for the service.  We walked in and found seats at the bar almost immediately, sat down and our server cleaned off our place. We started out with the house margarita and a beer, and decided to start off with Chips and Guac. I'm new to guacamole, probably within the past year or so, but if I had had this when I disliked it, it probably would've turned me. A little bit of kick to it? Yes please.  The lady and I both ordered 2 tacos, she got the fish tacos and the poblano one, and I got the pollo rojo and the short rib. Although small, these were great! Well crafted, very flavorful! You can tell that they get all their ingredients fresh (which they confirmed for us). Everything down to the sour mix for the margaritas is homemade. Really impressive.   We asked for our check and told our server that it was our first time here and we'd definitely be coming back. He returned with the check and told us \"The chips and guac are on me, thanks for coming out and seeing us!\" Shoutout to our server, Buck, for making a memorable Tuesday night. We WILL be back because of him, but for the food and atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great interior and atmosphere. Tacos are small, so order three. The food didn't wow me, but I'd come back for drinks and the people-watching."}
{"text":"Went there on the great reviews.  I was impressed.  This place has an underground level.  It also has a bar and seating.  The upstairs was really busy, so we tried it.  Got lucky to get seats at the bar quickly.  We ordered some margaritas.  They were good and the service was good too.  Decided to get some food.  We had the tacos.  The tacos were made on homemade style tortillas, which is always a plus.  Wife tried the chicken (Pollo Rojo), Pork (Cochinita Pibil), and Fish.  I tried the steak (Bistec), Mole, and pork (Al Pastor).  All of them were great, but my favorite was the mole.  It had a nice sauce and coleslaw.  The meat had a lot of flavor as well.  Then we ordered a pitcher (64 oz) of their seasonal margarita.  We got a couple cups with a tangy salt rim, pineapple and lime slices.  The bartender served our first serving.  We enjoyed every last bit of it until it was time to leave.  Tacos are $4 and the first two drinks averaged around $10 each.  The pitcher was a good option at $38, but worth it if you want to stick to one flavor.  Spent around $100 for both of us.  The atmosphere was good.  They had classic cowboy movies playing on the TV's and music at a good level to still have a conversation.  The crowd was late 20's to 30's, with a few older folks, like us.  People were dressed nicely and didn't see any issues all night.  No dancing available.  Great place for Mexican food in Pittsburgh and this is coming from someone who has had tacos in Mexico and East Los Angeles...here are pictures to help out."}
{"text":"Came here for the very first time and our experience here was beyond great! My boyfriend and I are from the west coast and the atmosphere is unlike anything we've come across back home. Our waitress Lindsay was awesome and very attentive. The food was amazing. We had the shrimp, rib, and el pastor tacos. Each taco was excellent. I also had a pineapple margarita which hit the spot. Overall very pleased with this place and if we ever happen to be on the east coast we will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the queso and chips. I don't know what the spices are but you can smell it a mile away and it is awesome. The crispy fish tacos are amazing. Order many. And to top it off Management gives good customer service.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how anyone can give them 5 stars  This place has  the worst, disgusting, tasteless, tacos I ever had , Cheap soft shell smaller than  small ones you buy at marcs stores and Mahi-mahi fish was tasteless. More flavor from van decamps fish sticks in the box. What a joke these were, and the casa cheese tasted like it was out of a jar! Parking sucks if you can find some and whats with the picnic tables? really? picnic tables.. I've eaten a lot of Mexican food around the country and this is in the bottom and for the price, it even puts them lower . Better off going to taco bell then this place ... Thumbs Down all the way!  Even the water tasted terrible like sewage water!"}
{"text":"Very please with my first experience at Bakersfield! When you first walk in, I was surprised at how it was decorated. It's sort of Tex mex honky Tonk meets rustbelt industry? I loved it.   Our waiter, Dave, was quirky and fun.  Very efficient.  The food was amazing. I'm a big fan of tacos across town, but this may be my new favorite place. The corn shells were perfect and rustic. Margaritas were a perfect blend. I loved the guacamole and salsas.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We went within the first couple weeks of opening, service wasn't great, we we're seated outside, and never got a server, we had multiple people walk passed our table with out any one greeting us. We had to ask for a server. I get its new and was busy, but seating us with out a server is ridiculous. Hopefully they've gotten better. Cincinnati location was much better."}
{"text":"Woah!  Let me TELL you that THIS is THE place to eat!!  I had some of the most amazing and unique soft-shelled tacos ever!!  The short rib taco was my favorite.  Very sweet and meaty!!  Let me tell you how much I hated the parking though!!  There is no parking area for the restaurant since it is a corner building. There is free valet, but we weren't interested.  So, we tried parking in the Harris Teeter parking lot in from of the CLOSED businesses who obviously do not need the parking spaces.  We were met by an ancient security guard who was actively chasing people down harassing them about not parking there if they were patrons of the new restaurant.  This man literally would yell across the parking lot at people and chastise them about why they were parking there.   NOT cool for business in the Dilworth area, and if I had a closed business there, I would want people to park there for a free advertising opportunity!  This would allow customers of the restaurant to see businesses they may not otherwise know were there!!  Anyway, the cocktails at the restaurant were beyond amazing.  The atmosphere was dark and had drop lighting using old fashioned bulbs that gave the place an awesome ambiance.  The waitstaff were very new, and needed to look at notes when they were asked questions, but they are new and so I don't blame them. I'd rather them know rather than guess!!     Plenty of TVs to watch, but the music will drown any sound out!  Fantastic experience and I plan on coming back MANY, many times!!  Also, this place had no desserts. So you will have to fill your sweet tooth some place else."}
{"text":"No other word than fantastic! Delicious cocktails and incredibly fresh food. Must go when downtown"}
{"text":"I could not be more happy with the short rib tacos and the fast service! This place reminds me of L.A. All the bartenders are awesome especially Kristen!"}
{"text":"Short rib tostada with an egg on top was very good. Daughter loves the fish and chicken tacos. Haley served us up in awesome style including a \"plain\" water with blackberries, pineapple and lemons...and a sombrero!  Sunny patio seating. John Wayne western on TV.  Good tunes incl Ramble On by Zepplin. All bueno."}
{"text":"Went last minute for my daughters birthday.  They accommodated six of us easily (Saturday night).  The margarita of the night was Pineapple and let me assure you, it was quite delicious!  (If I trusted that group of vagabonds I was with I might have had a few more!) we got chips and queso.  GET THE CHIPS AND QUESO!!  Or get the guac!  Nice chucks of avocado. Very fresh!  It comes in a nice lil iron skillet and it's all warm and mushy and cheesy and just a lil (like the perfect amount) toasty on top! Then we all ordered our tacos, they have several kinds to choose from, beef, barbacoa chicken, shrimp etc.  They came quickly on a huge tray and we dug in.  Each kind was very tasty, the mahi was the best!  Our friendly, knowledgeable, and zippy server, SCOTT was awesome.  He knew all the best tidbits of the foods, drinks, beer and was super friendly without being sappy.  He made us feel like he was glad we were there, and the coolest bunch at the place! (I, myself am a huge doofus, so you know, it was nice to not be made fun of!). We will definitely go back again, hopefully while we can still sit outside!  Also, the prices are very reasonable!!!  Just go there!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I went here on a late saturday afternoon for lunch. I was looking for a good taco place to go eat at. When I walked in the atmosphere itself was very warming and inviting. The tables are wooden picnic table where you can get seated with other people and  the lightings were really nice and modern. The bar was crowded so I decided to sit at a table. Since it wasn't too busy for a late afternoon I got seated away immediately. Soon as I got seated the server came with water and asked me \"If this was my first time here?\" Since it was he went over all the popular appetizers and dishes. I started off with chips and guacamole with a side of pickled jalapeños and habanero hot sauce. The chips were not hot and fresh but rather warm. The guacamole itself was very flavorful and rather chunkier than most guacamole which I prefer! The portion size of the appetizer was very small for it be $8. The pickled jalapeños and habanero hot sauce were $1 extra as well. Then i ordered their Bakersfield Margarita which the server suggested. This margarita was very delicious! The margarita comes in a mason jar and it runs about $8 for a glass! For dinner I ordered the short ribs torta and mole, cochinta pibil, and pork belly pastor tacos. The short ribs torta was okay to me. It came in a baguette type of bread with argula, black beans, and roasted salsa. I felt as though the short ribs itself lacked a lot of flavor and was very plain. The tacos were $4 each and very small. The corn tortillas that it came out in was very delicious! Each meat had good amount of flavor but somehow it didn't really go with everything that came with it! Overall the atmosphere is very nice and the service was excellent. But the food was okay and not as flavorful but for the price and size of what you get there are other options for tacos in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good tacos, the wait is always crazy and they don't take reservations, but it's a great place to grab drinks! Their jalapeño marg is the best!"}
{"text":"The margaritas at this place were AMAZING!!! Be careful thought because they sneak up on you. The tacos were great and the shrimp was by far my favorite. Everything tasted fresh and it was nice to be able to sit on the porch and enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. We ordered the tacos, the mole, the fish and the short rib ones. The short ribs taco is the best, but still plain and not with much flavor. The other two are ok, but really miss the restaurant in Cary, NC, which has the five star taco. Will not come back for this."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to return here with my best friend to introduce her to Bakersfield when I had previously visited. Normally they would seat you in a \"group\" setting but since this was her first time here I asked if we could dine alone so she would feel comfortable. They separated a high top table for us so we could chat.  Bakersfield is a chain restaurant named after Bakersfield,California where it was started. Everything on the menu is ala carte including the chips so the two of us decided to try a few of the tacos. I had told her they were made in house so she was thrilled with the opportunity to try fresh and not store bought taco shells. We ordered a total of six. We both had the steak with slaw, the pulled chicken and slaw. She opted for a second steak one for the fifth and i went with my favorite which was the pork with pineapple.  They were so good but so messy! They give you a large plate along with silverware to catch the drippings. The chicken a bit of a zing to it, my pork and pineapple was absolutely delicious. I found the steak one to be just slightly tough but we were basically pleased with all our choices.  We came over the lunch hour so it wasn't too busy. But it was still fairly loud!  We decided to forgo the bevvies since we had theater tickets.  I must admit our waiter was correct that 2-3 tacos a piece is sufficient for a meal. The tacos sell for $4.00 each. She told me this place offered one of the best tacos she had ever eaten so this place will be on our return list when we are downtown again."}
{"text":"Every star deserved!! Service is impeccable, Pittsburgh should be proud. We met so many of the awesome staff that I feel like family. Dylan was our waiter and was great. The Bistec taco was incredible, the queso and guac were also great. Ambiance and music were great. Seems like all Bakersfield locations are in the real heartland spots in America. What a great time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ah, Bakersfield. How you try. This place is way too hip for the average commoner - make sure you dress accordingly. The food is great, if you don't mind the occasional hour-long wait. The ambiance is cool, when they're not vacuuming all the seats around you three hours from closing time. Basically, Bakersfield has a lot of potential, but it's got a few kinks that could be ironed out. Bring date, not kid"}
{"text":"Came for the tacos and stayed for the margaritas! You can't go wrong with any of the tacos and make sure to get a margarita to wash it down. The staff are super friendly and the place has 2 levels. The lighting is a bit dim, but you can still see everything. Parking can be a bit of a pain since it's downtown area but find a parking structure nearby because it's cheaper than those parking lots."}
{"text":"This was a perfect spot for us when we arrived in Pittsburgh. We just got to the hotel, which was across the street. After a day of flying and not quite dinner time, we wanted to find a nearby happy hour for snacks and drinks.  We walked over to Bakersfield. When we went in, the staff greeted us right away. They were friendly and the ready to serve. We ordered some really inexpensive beers and guac. It was a perfect snack to buy time and fill up our bellies to continue exploring the city. We had a great experience. If we ever were back in town, we'd definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"I liked this place!!  I love the atmosphere and I think it is great to have a tex-mex trendy but affordable spot added to the Dilworth restaurant scene.   Parking is a PAIN.  Best bet is to valet across the way.  They definitely need to figure out the parking situation because I would imagine it deters people from dining there.  We were here on a cold Monday night and it was still pretty packed so they will hopefully figure out a way to accommodate their customers.  The service was so-so.  Our waitress wasn't able to really recommend anything because she doesn't eat corn so therefore had not tried any of the tacos.  That was a little annoying but it happens.  She was just a little bla for this hyped up restaurant but again, it happens.  We ordered the guacamole and I found it to be wonderful!  It was chunky, great flavor and consistency.  My only complaint is that it was too small of a portion!  4 of us wolfed that thing down in minutes.  Can I also just say I hate that they don't just offer free chips and salsa?  Why?  Seriously why not?  They do put two bottles of salsa on the table for you to add to your tacos so we basically ate the whole bottle by dumping the salsa on chips.  Yay us!!  We figured out a way to have free chips and salsa! ha! The avocado green salsa was very very good!!  The other one was smoky and hot and just so-so.    We all ordered tacos and I thought they were pretty decent!  The chicken on the chicken roja was tender and full of flavor.  It was nicely complimented by the cilantro cream sauce and queso.  It all blended quite well.  We all enjoyed our tacos very much.  The wine we had was okay--not a great selection but I'm sure that isn't what they are known for.  It was my sister's birthday and they offered a free shot of tequila which was pretty funny.  No dessert menu which I hate because I need dessert at all times.  Quick fix?  Head to Menchies down the street.  I'm sure they appreciate the business!    Overall I like this place.  I think it has a great vibe, decent food, so-so service and terrible parking.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"So Delicious.  My girl Brandi suggested we meet at Bakersfiled this past Sunday.  So good,  Cool atmosphere, great food, service good, lively joint. We shared the queso and chips, none better.  My girl had the chicken sandwich, I will order this my next time there.  My man Alex tried the tacos and loved them.  I had some thing I can't recall, but it tasted good.  Will def go back for that chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Bakersfield... I think you win my heart for best taco in Pittsburgh.  Just look at the photos - these *look* like tacos you get in Mexico or the right parts of Texas.  Cotija cheese, huitlacoche (mmmm .... corn smut!), cilantro, pickled onions, poblanos.... you pull all the right punches in all the right places."}
{"text":"What a great new treat to East Blvd.  We arrived on a Friday night around 7:00pm and was told it was a 10 minute wait, not bad at all. We proceeded to the bar, which is amazing. A great wrap around bar with a long communal standing table on one side.  It was crowded, but we were able to sneak in at the counter and order drinks. I chose the house margarita, WOW, loved it! It was definitely made fresh and had a great tequila kick.  My friend ordered a beer, which they do offer a great selection.  After around 10 minutes we were seated at a high table in the front of the restaurant. We started with the chips, salsa and guacamole. All great!  As for entrees, I chose the Mole Taco and the Tostado. The others ordered a variety of tacos.  I will say the Tostado was AMAZING. Black beans with chicken on a lightly fried tortilla, it was one of the best I have ever had. As for the tacos everyone said the Mole and the Short Rib were the best. The service was great too, a definite added bonus.  Only downfall, the TVs and noise level was very high, we felt like we were screaming the entire time.  However, the food was well worth another visit and a new frequent stop for those of us who live in the Dilworth area.  Thank you Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Great service, strong (i.e. perfect) margaritas, and tons of great food options. I've gone multiple times and loved it each time."}
{"text":"Yaassss!  Okay, I'm not really sure what that means but it sounds positive, so that's why I started my review of Bakersfield with that.  Backstory, in 2015 my posse and I were in Nashville for a race and afterwards, we had an amazing meal at Bakersfield.  Great drinks, delicious queso, outstanding tacos, yada yada yada, you get the picture.  Fast forward to 2016 when we are in the 'burgh for a race and as we are casually strolling down Penn Ave, we see \"Bakersfield\"!   It looks similar so we decide to try it out for lunch and found out that it is indeed the newest location of the same place that we loved in Nashville.  So of course we ordered drinks and queso and I had a tostada that was outstanding.  The queso was as good as we remembered and my margarita was very tasty.  Service was fun and friendly and the cost didn't break the bank.  So if someone asks if you should visit Bakersfield, the only appropriate response is \"Yaaassss!\""}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite bar in downtown Pittsburgh. Stopped in tonight with friends and, as usual,  i was not disappointed. Our bartender Amanda recommended the \"Bakersfield\" margarita which I'd never had and i have to admit i was impressed, it won't be the last one of those i have!   long story short,  try the Bakersfield and get yourself a torta, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here last night (a Sunday) on a date and the place was jam packed with a 30 minute wait. The overall ambiance of Bakersfield is great and I love their little boot steins for beer. It's so Texas! After living in Austin for 4 years, it tends to be hard to please me when it comes to tacos, so I'm basing it on that.   First, our server was really friendly and gave good service, but she got our order wrong. My date ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2, and they brought out 4 on a tin tray and 2 of them were incorrect. We asked the runner which tacos were which and then she ran back to the kitchen to grab the other. The server came over and apologized for the mistake, so no biggie on that!  I had one of the mole tacos and an al pastor. The mole was pretty good and the pastor with the pineapple was awesome. My only complaint is that the tortilla was a little dry.   I would return here and get some different items. All in all a good experience!  Note: In a previous reviewers post she said that the restaurant didn't use the NoWait app, however, they have changed that. We used it last night and were notified at the time we were to be seated via that app."}
{"text":"My first time at Bakersfield was early afternoon so the place was pretty empty. Still I liked the atmosphere and decor. The bartender was really friendly. She asked if it was my first time then proactively offered information about the specials and menu.   I got the pineapple margarita which was a special. It was really good and served in a mason jar with a garnish slice of pineapple.   For a snack I had two different tacos. An order of a taco manifests in just one, open-faced, soft, house made tortilla.   I tried the Pollo Rojo which I preferred to the Al Pastor. The chicken taco had more intense flavor with a chili salsa and chipotle lime sauce topping. The portion on the chicken taco also seemed a bit larger compared to the Al Pastor. The Al Pastor is a pork taco with a more sweet profile. It is topped with pineapple, onion and cilantro.  Overall I think I prefer Barrio. While I like the idea of the pre-designed menu here at Bakersfield, and maybe even the atmosphere more, Barrio's tacos seemed larger and more memorable. I also like the free chips and salsa at Barrio. Bakersfield definitely stands above places like Coastal Taco though and other restaurants that just have a taco or two on the menu. I'd certainly do Bakersfield again, but I likely won't get a taste for it."}
{"text":"It's been months... and I'm still dreaming about that Cuban sandwich. Sweet Jesus. I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"I'd really been looking forward to trying this place. A) it's super close to my house. B) I love tacos.   The inside looks like three partners couldn't decide on a theme, so they just merged all of their ideas. Too many different trends. The menu looked amazing, but I found the execution to be lacking. The best taco I had was their special for the day -- it was honestly wonderful. Also, what gives with the charge for chips and salad? Follow the status quo, you are a Mexican restaurant. If I want tacos in Cleveland, my go to remains Barrio. You just can't beat it for the price, quality or taste."}
{"text":"If you love queso, you have to go check this place out. Great service, a little pricey, but totally worth it if you're looking to splurge."}
{"text":"Very solid chain concept that can be found in quite a few metropolitan cities (I've been to this one and the one in Charlotte).  Their spicy margarita with homemade pickled jalapeno is delicious and highly recommended and all of their tacos look great when they come out on a pizza style platter."}
{"text":"I am so happy with all of the fantastic new taco places opening up around Pittsburgh lately. And Bakersfield is near the top of the list!  Bakersfield has a nice vibe that I find comparable to many of the other urban/industrial restaurants that have been opening in recent months. There's a nice mural on one of the walls, and of course, plenty of exposed brick and lightbulbs. Bakersfield is larger than I thought it would be which was a nice surprise. There are two different bars: one on the main level and one on the lower level. As a whole, the space is very clean and has a warm atmosphere.  My friends and I came on a Monday around 5:30 PM and were told we'd have about a 30 minute wait for our table. We headed over to one of the bars for some guac, queso, and drinks before being seated. I ordered a margarita, which is a bit out of character for me, but I absolutely loved it. It was the perfect mix of salty and sweet and was definitely worth the $8 price since it came in a large mason jar. I had read rave reviews about both the guac and queso on Yelp so we were looking forward to trying both...and we were highly impressed! I honestly could not choose a favorite. The queso came out piping hot and charred on the top, and had just the perfect amount of zest to it. The guacamole was some of the best I've had in a long time. I'm sure this seems nitpicky, but I'm always upset when I order dip at a restaurant and they're stingy with the chips - there's nothing worse than having extra dip leftover and no chips to eat it with. We definitely didn't have this problem at Bakersfield.  A note on the service - from the hostess to the bartender to our waitress (shout out to Beans!), I was overly impressed. Everyone was extremely upbeat and clearly cared to make our meal a positive one. Unfortunately we ended up having to wait about an hour and 15 minutes for our table (some people refused to leave even though they had already paid), but the hostess was very apologetic and ultimately it wasn't the restaurant's fault. When we finally were seated, we ordered a myriad of tacos. I decided on the pollo rojo taco, which was phenomenal. I loved all the fresh cilantro on top, and the chicken was flavored perfectly. I think I could have eaten ten of these!  At the end of the night one of the managers, Justin, came over to our table to ask about our experience, which was a nice touch. Overall, my first experience at Bakersfield was wonderful and I absolutely can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and drinks! My friends and I split the queso and chips, and added the spicy chorizo. It was great and flavorful! We all had two tacos each, my favorite was the short rib! It had great smokey flavor. The fish taco was good as well, but the fish was fried and a little overcooked, but I enjoyed the slaw on it. The margaritas were good! We ordered a pitcher, and then individual ones as well. The individual ones were definitely a lot stronger, but both were still good! Also, great service and atmosphere for happy hour! Overall, I would go back, it was great for after work drinks and snacks!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Got guac both times, which is really good. Though the second time our guac probably had a quarter of a whole avocado unmashed in there. The chips are warm, salty, and crunchy. I got the short rib tostada the first time and I enjoyed it. The egg was perfectly cooked and the meat well seasoned. The second time I got the fish and Pollo Rojo tacos and I was quite disappointed in them. The homemade tortillas were tasteless and not warmed up. The Pollo Rojo was really wet and liquid for everywhere as I tried to eat it. The fish taco didn't taste like anything.   Can't speak for the drinks because I don't drink, but they seemed a little pricey too. Would I come back? Maybe... But perhaps not soon."}
{"text":"The state of North Carolina banned me from drinkin tequila back in '92 but I broke the law cause these damn margaritas are amazing. Food is good too. Them Bistec tacos made bout fall out in the floor. Plus the women in this joint...ooowee!  Overall A"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the 2 vegetarian tacos and my friend had the pork belly, chicken and fish tacos. We both loved every single one of them! The drinks were delicious, super fresh. I live in Boston but if I lived in Charlotte id go here all the time!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here now. I've been giving them three stars for the food, because their pollo is so dry. Long story short..Every time I think it'll improve, it didn't. However, I decided to give four stars because their margaritas are on point.  I got many different tacos, but every damn time I'm just so disappointed by the fact the chicken is dry. The other tacos are good but I still didn't think they're outstanding. I want to like them so badly, but overall I just come here for the margaritas and the cool atmosphere. Me and my friends had a good time, and I'm rating them because of that. I'll summarize it again, their guac and margaritas are good. But I have better tacos in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Did someone say tacos?! I'm always down for some good Mexican food, and Bakersfield left a fantastic first impression on me. I loved the ambiance of the place. Super trendy with a classier vibe yet I won't feel out of place dining in jeans and a tee. It was actually very reminiscent of Tako, a restaurant few blocks over.    If you only come for one thing, get the chips and guac! Best guac I've had in my life (seriously!). It's made in-house and prepared fresh every thirty minutes. Ah-mazing!  Highly recommend the Papas Tostada for anyone looking for a meatless option. It's a crispy tortilla on a bed of shredded lettuce that is piled with black beans, crispy potatoes, salsa, guac, and poblano. For only $7, I was expecting a smaller portion, but the tostada filled even my black hole of a stomach. So delicious I wanted to cry.   Service was phenomenal from start to finish. We were seated immediately as we entered, and our waitress was very bubbly and friendly. She gave many good tips about what to select off the menu and pointed out the best vegetarian options. Although we came during the lunch rush, the food came out pretty quickly.   There you have it. Fantastic food, great ambiance, stellar customer service. Bakersfield's got the whole package and my stamp of approval. I will be back soon for those tacos!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant my friends and I went to when we arrived in Pittsburgh. Very good, authentic tacos and great margaritas. Friendly staff. The only issue was when it came to the bill. We told them how it was to be split and both times it wasn't right. We managed, though. The food is still good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here all the time for the pitcher of margarita which is always a great choice. Their queso with everything (black beans, chorizo, and jalapeños) is amazing! It's comes in a little cast iron skillet to keep it warm with fresh warm chips. They have some really good tacos as well, my favs are the fish, baja shrimp, and short rib. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing, great for a date night or a night out with friends. The one thing I wish they had would be drink specials on holidays like National Margarita Day, National Tequila Day, or Cinco de Mayo because they usually have signs about them but never an specials when you go in.  Other than the queso & pitcher of margaritas, I love that they have ample amount charging outlets."}
{"text":"OMG not only is the bar lined with bag hooks but outlets/USB ports too so you can charge devices. This alone is a plus!!!   PBR in a boot for 3 bux-heck yeah!  No this isn't an authentic taco joint but they're good. Bistec (steak) and Pollo Rojo so good. Love the chips and queso too. Tacos range about 4 bux a piece.  Daily drink specials. Shot of the day $3. Featured flights $15 and more.  All in all prices are decent for being in a prime downtown location. It's like a more upscale (but not really) neighborhood bar that happens to serve tacos.  3-330 pm on a weekday is a great time because the normal packed scene just doesn't exist. It's steady but you can get a seat anywhere; at the bar, booth or table.  Love the rustic/cowboy decor and the fact that the salads are named after country stars.  Normally very skeptical and jaded about chain establishments but this one is a-ok.  Bartenders and servers seem to really like working here. That's always a good sign.  Finally, again, outlets!!!!"}
{"text":"Service here was second to none! We were checked on frequently & by numerous folks, including a manager. Our waiter was excellent & the tacos were very good.  I got the shrimp tacos and they were crispy & mouth watering. And you HAVE to order the green salsa they have, made of tomatillos, avacado & jalapeno, etc., it was delish with their warm, house made tortilla chips!  Also loved the fresh, house made corn tortillas the tacos are served on.  The vibe here is really nice, makes you want to just sit & relax."}
{"text":"Bakersfield has side of the freshest tasting meals I've had in downtown Pittsburgh. Olivia and Kurt have been great to us, and we can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican American I know good Mexican food. Fresh tortillas and the flavoring of the food is on point."}
{"text":"It's a good addition to the 25th food options. The margaritas are a little expensive (cleveland standards) but they are delicious. The staff was friendly and gave gold suggestions. Their queso is very traditional. They don't give free chips and salsa, but the app is only three dollars. Sometimes there is a wait, but there are plenty of nearby shops to checkout while you wait."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious.   I'm a big fan of their vegetarian tacos and the papas tostadas! They're very flavorful and fresh. The guacamole here is amazing as well! It's so fresh and addicting!   Their drinks are a little expensive but they're so good! I love the Bakersfield Margarita! It's so seeet and tangy."}
{"text":"There's a lot of competition when it comes to Mexican food in Pittsburgh. Bakersfield really holds it's own with a hip and well-lit environment, friendly waitstaff, and amazing food. A person can go through their entire menu in just a few visits because they serve inexpensive, small gourmet tacos, so you can buy three or more and be perfectly satisfied. The chips and dip are good as well! I will definitely be back in the future.   Pro tip: call for reservations or expect a long wait. We ended up waiting for a table for over 15 minutes and ended up in communal seating anyways. Still a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night but still it was packed with people. Awesome restaurant with great selection and prices.  Guacamole is made fresh every 60 minutes, nachos  also made in-house fresh and warm. You can order taco ala-carte to choose from 6 varieties (a delicious vegi one too).  Drinks are great too - craft beer $4 and up and margaritas-10-14$. Spicy jalapeño margarita is a must try.  Overall a great place to have a great meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Husband felt his ensalada was misting something so he was given three different sauce/salsa options to try. Queso was delicious. My tacos were tasty and filling. I even ate the radish- which I never do!"}
{"text":"One of the best & tastiest tex-mex food . Everything on the menu taste excellent. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but as a local-ish chain not from the 412, you're walking into some stiff competition in the Pittsburgh market at this point. But I am all for giving every business a chance, especially if you like tacos and tequila!   The name definitely doesn't speak to a Mexican joint, but I don't think they want to be labeled \"authentic Mexican\" by any means. I think they just want to have a casual atmosphere where you can enjoy some good food and drinks.   It's an absolutely beautiful space with a barn chic kinda feel. They have a small bar and picnic tables to dine at. We bellied up to the bar and got the scoop on specials for happy hour. Apparently their schtick is $3 shots of a certain booze that rotates and PBR on draft all night long. Literally from what I saw there were two drafts on tap and then a handful of craft bottled beers. So if you are all about tequila this is your jam, because they have a huge list (as well as whiskey) and various margarita's.   I ordered a marg, and while I did enjoy it, I felt like this one was a little on the sweet side, even after asking to see if it was more sour than sweet. I've had good margs that aren't too sweet, so I know they're out there, I swear!  But the tacos were great! I ordered the fish and short rib. While I liked both, I think the short rib won out among the two. We also ordered guac and it was very good! I loved that it was limey. The avocados could have been cut into a little smaller pieces, because I was basically picking up half the avocado on every chip... but that's not the worst thing in the world, right?  I feel like this place could totally get crazy at night... so I'll be back for a nightcap soon!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place overall. I'll start with the bass and end on a good note.   Food - I ordered bistec, fish and one of the chicken tacos (not the mole, but can't remember what it was called). Bistec was a bit gummy to my taste but flavor was good.  The fish tacos tasted like frozen Long John Silvers fish, so I was pretty disappointed in that. The chicken tacos were excellent. The guacamole was on the garlicy side, but I loved it.   Ambiance - Aside from the sweet specials menu, the first thing I noticed was the funky smell. It was a bit off-putting as the first impression.  While waiting for our table, we went downstairs to the lesser crowded bar. The scene was chill and it wasn't as loud as it was upstairs. The upstairs area music is extremely loud so everyone has to tell to have a conversation making it that much louder. I would recommend to the staff to turn the music down a few notches.   Drinks - drinks were great, although I refrained from doing any of the shot specials, I was tempted. I stuck with the jalapeño Marg all night. It was delicious.   Staff - staff was well informed, courteous and helpful. They did great with our party of 4."}
{"text":"While it's probably unreasonable to expect authentic tacos in Pittsburgh, it's not unreasonable to expect delicious tacos.  Good service, though, which is a given most places but a plus for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and good food...the noise level is high and may be a bit off putting but the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Considering how much I've heard about Bakersfield I was excited to be blown away by these tacos, but they may just not be my kind of tacos. Overall they were a little bland and dry for me. The girls I went with did like them but I prefer a more loaded taco.  I ordered a pineapple margarita and two tacos to start. They were a little small so I ended up ordering another one.   Pineapple margarita - felt like it was lacking in flavor other than the sweetness of the pineapple  Baja Shrimp - I tried this taco from a friend and it was definitely the highlight. The shrimp was crunchy, flavorful and perfectly cooked Pollo Asado - This taco was my second favorite. The chicken and black beans together were a nice combination Huitlacoche- I love corn in every form and while this taco was good, it was a little dry Pastor chicken special - the taco was spicy and pretty good  It was strange to me that a Mexican restaurant charged for chips and salsa.   Our waiter and the service was outstanding, so I want to give it another shot with the tostada next time."}
{"text":"I don't rate places at all but I had to put this down for them.  Soul satisfying food and margaritas. My favorite in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Get the pork belly taco and the short rib torta. Wash it all down with a house margarita!!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem!!! If only I lived in Charlotte!! I was visiting from Arizona over Christmas and I took my daughter and 2 year old grandson there for dinner!!!  The whole staff was welcoming and friendly!! Our server Cece is a doll!!! She was very pleasant and helpful when it came to recommending items from the menu!!  We loved each and everyone of them!  My favorite was the Chicken & Chorizo Tostada!! The guac is to die for!!! My Grandson was eating it with a spoon and wanted seconds ;) Overall, a pleasurable dining experience!!! I definitely will be making that a must the next time I'm in Charlotte!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and margaritas!! Pork belly and bistec were my favorites. Our server, Danielle, was super friendly and did a great job.  A definite must try while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good place to have lunch and happened by Bakersfield Penn Ave in Pittsburgh, PA. We decided to give it a try and loved it. It is basically a Mexican restaurant with very good tacos and margaritas. I had a short rib taco, my wife had a fish taco, and both were excellent. The guacamole is made fresh every 15 minutes, and it is delicious. We were surprised to find such good Mexican food in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We were definitely excited about a new Mexican-type restaurant opening up, so we checked out Bakersfield on a Saturday.  This place is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, so we were a little bit disappointed.  Think of it as a Mexican themed All American Pub. (in terms of atmosphere and crowd)  It was pretty loud and crowded by 7pm.  We waited 45 mins for a table, and then we were finally seated at a picnic table with some strangers. I hate eating at community seating when I go out to eat.  It just makes me think the restaurant is cheap and trying to cram as many humans into a sardine can as possible. When you eat at a picnic table you don't really ever settle in and enjoy yourself, either.  In terms of food and drink, the margaritas were good and the tacos we ordered were very good. The short rib one was probably the best, but the rest were serviceable. One nice thing is that you can order them a la carte, so you can try the different ones out. Unfortunately, they charge you for chips and salsa, which rubs me the wrong way as well.  They aren't even good or special.    I may go back here for some drinks and to sit at the bar, but never again for eating.  The value is in the margaritas, not the overpriced food you get to experience at a picnic table with strangers, while people slam into you as they shuffle around the bar."}
{"text":"The margarita was fantastic - one of the best in the Charlotte area. I like the style of this restaurant and clearly a lot of others do too. It was VERY crowded and loud on a Tuesday night. The queso was okay, but left a little to be desired. Next time I will add chorizo or jalapeños to kick it up a bit. The cochinita pibil taco was my favorite and I recommend it if you like spiThe tortillas are nice and soft. The service wasn't the best, but also wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome queso. Best tortas in town. Really really tasty tacos. I gave it 4 stars mainly because the tacos aren't exactly generous for the price, but they are certainly delicious. Salads are really great too. Homemade hotsauce/salsa is a little different but I personally love it."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this restaurant, great addition to the Cleveland food scene! Although they don't take reservations, you can download the app called Nowait and add your name to the list beforehand! The spicy margarita was amazingly delicious. All the tacos were super yummy but just a heads up, they use corn shells which I know some people don't love. Other all it was a great visit to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"Two words... Pineapple Margarita!  The fresh pineapple balances out the tequila perrrfectly.  And the seasoned rim salt makes an impression. It's very easy to throw a few of these back  Kelsey served 'em up right during the Monday lunch rush... She was very attentive, personable, and provided great service!    Despite being the only bartender on, and only having just one server on the floor, I think the ladies handled everything impeccably... I honestly don't believe anyone (6 tables, 3 bar groups) ever had to wait to order or receive what they needed.  The a la carte tacos are a little small, but big on flavor.  The fresh, homemade skillet queso is unlike most others though - great consistency and the perfect amount of spice!  You know this didn't come out of a jar   I feel like Bakersfield has lost a little bit of its spunk in recent months, but I hear there are some positive changes/improvements on the horizon... I look forward to coming back again soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I just moved back to cle from NYC and were so concerned there wasn't a good eclectic taco place. The worries are gone! This place is amazing. The chips were incredible along with the queso and we loved the tacos and tortas!Awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good food and a fun place to eat. I ordered the short rib tostada,  which was an explosion of spice, lime, and exotic flavors.   The wait staff was very attentive and the service was quick.   The beer list was extensive, although the draft list was relatively small."}
{"text":"So, don't expect authentic Mexican street tacos here. The tacos were good. Not Amazing, but good. I had three: pork belly, fish and the short rib. Pork belly was dry and not fatty at all (that last part may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective). The toppings were good. I did not like the short rib one at all. Not my bag of chips. Now, the fish was pretty darn good.  Crunchy fried with s nice combination of toppings. Oh and I almost forgot, they make their own tortillas and they are solid!  However, best thing of the night was the guacamole. It was different. Very chunky and I like the fact that it was all avocado. I hate guac that's muddled with tomatoes and other ingredients. This was perfectly lime green avocado and lots of garlic for a change. Perfectly seasoned creamy chunks. I've been craving the guacamole ever since. Need to go back and taste a few other tacos."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (as mentioned in all other reviews). You must definitely try out this place if you like Mexican food"}
{"text":"Favorite local taco spot with great margaritas and beers on tap. Sometimes difficult to get a table around happy hour / peak times, but the wait is worth it. Sandwiches and salads are also good. Queso and guacamole are solid as well."}
{"text":"Bakersfield does not disappoint when it comes to tacos! Adam was our server and he really made our day special!"}
{"text":"Just tried Bakerfeld today for lunch and was very impressed. Great service and atmosphere. A friend and I shared the chips and salsa (so good), I had the short rib tostada recommended by the server (amazing) and my friend had a few different tacos (she loved). I can't wait to go back for margaritas on the patio and their guacamole. Great add to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. For excellent mex-tex with a kick, order the queso with everything (jalapeno, beans, and chorizo) and the chochinita tacos. The home-made tortillas are fantastically made. Just one tortilla holds up the entire taco."}
{"text":"This is the spot for large groups. The flat rate of $15 for parties of 6 or more is a great value and I promise no one will leave hungry. I was disappointed in the lack of veg options and the two veg tacos offered both had mushrooms, which I despise :) I did end up trying one only to remind myself that, yah, mushrooms aren't for me! I did enjoy the papas tostados and it was quite a generous serving for the price. I also wasn't a huge fan of my Spicy Margarita - while it tasted delicious, the lack of alcohol was apparent and I passed on a second $10 drink.   If anyone asks me where to go with a large party, I will def recommend Bakersfield. Bonus, it's loud as all get out in there so if you're a loud person (some people make that claim about me), no one will even notice! And our server did a great job despite some small mishaps and really was hustling serving several large groups."}
{"text":"CJ and the guac were Da bomb.com! Perfect for Happy Hour!! Awesome Margaritas and whiskey!"}
{"text":"YASSSSSSSSSSSSS.. I have been dieing to get to this lil mexican spot and all i can say it was worth the wait. Aside from the decor and lighting it was a really cool vibe in here. I came here with two of my friends and we all loved our food.Our sever was more than great and when she brought our food out she came with a team we were like geesh we feel like royalty here no lie! I had the melanese sandwhich, and i ordered two margaritas the bakersfield and the pineapple margarita, i came with every intention to order their seasonal watermelon rosemary margarita which our server mentioned they are no longer serving those at the moment i had my taste buds all ready so i have to catch that one the next time around. Oh and how can i  forget my guacamole and chips the guacamole was to die for with the almost a hint of spice very good. I will definelty re visit this place of business very soon !"}
{"text":"Bakersfield is a great, cozy feeling place with tons of atmosphere, in an easy to access location! Great Servers and excellent, fresh food makes this a fun spot to stop and meet Friends?"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place.  However, the warm draft beer quickly tempered the excitement of the seemingly authentic menu.  The queso is good, but it ain't got nuttin' on the mighty Smoke's queso down the road.  And order at least 4-5 tacos 'cause they're mini (Dr. Evil voice), but they were meh despite the welcomed variety and promising flavor combos.  If you want another beer, just keep eating since the bar keeps are inattentive (whilst even seated at the bar?!).  The taco game in Pittsburgh is too strong these days to warrant an immediate return trip, but Bakersfield is a nice addition to downtown."}
{"text":"We had no idea what to expect walking in here. We were blown away. The ambience, service, drinks, food - even the music - all outstanding. The best Mexican food I've had in years. The queso is insane. The guacamole is insane. It was hard to make room for the rest of the menu, which is - wait for it - insane. That good. Can't wait to go back. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant already planning my next visit. Don't let the parking scare you off. Park across the street at Jersey Mike's (it's allowed). Try a Paloma. Have a shot. Get the queso."}
{"text":"Went for lunch...sat at the bar was greeted in timely manner ordered my drink and a chips and queso. Very underwhelming the queso tasted like it was reheated and held at too high of a temperature...was very grainy. For my \"entree\" I ordered two tacos one Al Pastor and one Brisket Taco. Al Pastor is my favorite taco and this one was to say the least the worst one I've ever had....small bits of pork smothered in chunks of pineapple...traditional Al Pastor is slow cooked pork with the pineapple cooked along with it to impart more flavor.....this was not the case with this dish. The brisket taco was no better...shredded flavorless meat in a poorly made taco shell. Had I not been so hungry I would have left after the first bite of both tacos. And the service can be summed up with this interaction between the bartender and new guests walking in ...\"Sit anywhere???\" Asks the guest and the bartender responds with \"Yeah I guess So\" Needless to say I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. We had to wait a bit on a Sunday night but nothing too bad. Guac was good, on the chunky side though. Tacos were very good and the sauces were a nice addition. Would go back but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Love this place! Margaritas are strong, gauc is always perfect. Papas tostado is full of flavor and texture! Must go to in pgh"}
{"text":"Had a great time with Supper Club group here.  It is so much fun getting to socialize and try so many different items family style.  For groups of 6 or more this IS the way to go.  We were continuously served menu items until we could eat no more. The queso dip was unbelievably delicious as well as the Johnny salad.  What a salad!  I think both could be very addicting. I also enjoyed my oh so very tasty margarita.  As the others may have mentioned, they sneak up on you.  Loved the sampler of tacos!  Nice way to try ones you might not normally order.  The vegetarian and carnita were my favorites and would skip the fish taco. The staff really did an amazing job with our group.  Everyone left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get tacos in Charlotte. We came in on a rainy Sunday and had excellent service the bartender Doug was attentive and made amazing drinks. The manager (Maggie was her name I think) was super attentive and was walking around making sure everything was amazing. Our waitress was super informative and super attentive. A must do in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Amazing margaritas. The queso is to die for. Homemade tortillas for the tacos. The hongos taco is my favorite. This is one of our favorite Charlotte spots!"}
{"text":"So we walked into Bakersfield on Friday night. The service was incredible!!! Our server Matias came to us with a highly positive energy after we sat at our table. Explaining to us the menu and giving recommendations. We found that he is amazing with custimer service so is the rest of the staff. After receiving our drinks and food. We found the food and drinks to be amazing. The drinks where out of this word, which led us to ask who made it. Matias pointed us to Karl and he was great! I had an amazing experience will be back for these two guys. Me and my girl left there really happy will be back. Also recommend for any one who goes to ask for them."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. Each taco has it s own flavor and taste to it. And to top it, it is not as costly. Definitely a must try when you are looking to get out with ur friends or family."}
{"text":"Guacamole gets an A+!!!! Big avocado hunks and lots of lime. Very flavorful and comes with plenty of yummy chips.   Tried a fish taco and the mole. Both were B- tacos. I know my way around a fish taco and geeze was I disappointed. I got the mole to try something different and it was highly suggested. I felt that it lacked in taco accessories and was mainly a big glob of meat. Also none of the hot sauces were spicy at all.  The spicy margarita was really good and well made. Price was right and maybe even on the cheap side since it was in a big mason jar.  Has a different feel than other taco places... Tex mex vibe was unique and welcomed. Location is good too. The service was also really great."}
{"text":"Cinco de mayo... 2 hour long wait... Laura is the best server I've had downtown ever. With all of the chaos she was incredibly sweet, quick, and efficient the entire time. The food is incredible.. But more importantly, the service during my \"hangry\" hour was incredible thanks to Laura!!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone for food, I am disappointed. Their tacos just aren't my cup of tea. Unless your meal consists entirely of queso cheese (straight cheese -- none of the fancy toppings). Then you will be in heaven because it's excellent. If you're looking for a lively atmosphere to grab a drink, they fit the bill. Just plan on a little bit of a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Mexican, you have my heart wrapped up like a perfect burrito. Well Bakersfield focuses on tacos, but you catch my drift. On a hunt for Mexican Liz and I stumbled on this place, new to East Blvd. but it's actually a small chain for what I Googled. The place was packed, not too surprisingly for a Saturday night and a 30 minute wait, not bad.   The decor is cool, rustic, with Edison bulbs hanging and thick wooden slabs as the table, I liked the place. A small tapas style place, Liz and I got the cheese dip, guac and a few tacos. We decided not to indulge in a Margarita, even though they looked good! We stuck to eating our calories. Our service was fast and friendly, always a good thing for a new restaurant.   The guacamole was fresh, chunky and a tad spicy. The Cheese dip was different, not a white creamy kind usually found in southern Mexican joints. It actually tasted more like real cheese, it was filling, just not what I was expecting.   The el pastor taco with pineapple was deli-sh as well as the fish tacos. I'm sure we will be visiting this place again.   Warning- Be careful where you park since this location doesn't have a parking lot. We parked int he Harris teeter lot ( and they didn't like that very much ) Also, they don't have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a moderately busy Tuesday afternoon.  Great service, really good food and strong drinks.  I should mention the guac was very fresh and tasty, my Bakersfield margarita was perfection and my server (short blond hair with tattoos) was friendly and efficient.  We will definately be back.  Just a side note, wouldn't mind something other than country music playing in the background...How about a little old school hip-hop?!"}
{"text":"Loved the food - hated the ambience!!! Way too noisy for good conversation and the service was mediocre at best!!!  Good enough to stop in for a quick bite alone after work on a weekday but not on a weekend evening!!!  Great place for take out - going to see if any of the local delivery services pickup from there - but I don't plan on going back for another dine-in anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing. Margarita is perfect. QUESO IS EVERYTHING. SO SO SO GOOD. The tacos are small, but the prices are good.  It's bro-city, so if you aren't into that...well... It's worth it though for the food."}
{"text":"The lovely folks at Bakersfield treated our Supper Club group like royalty tonight. Supper Clubbers can get a little bossy, a little feisty, and apparently a little drunk (I'm looking at you, Sheena), and they dealt with our snark and sass with style. Brandon and Dreamy Matt were our servers; both were super friendly and attentive. We also had visits from GM Neil and Manager Joe Not Joel; it was clear that they all wanted to make sure we had a good experience, so thumbs up all around, gentlemen. Thank you for your patience with our obnoxious group; service was impeccable for a place that's only been open for a couple of weeks.  Most of us opted for the Selecciones menu (essentially $15 for a more family-style sampling of apps, salad, and tacos...groups of six or more only) which was a great way to try a lot of the offerings. I think my favorite was the queso with the pickled jalapenos. The tacos were tasty although I actually think some of the fillings needed salt. I'm not a heavy salt user, so this surprised me, but it may be because the tortillas seemed on the bland side. That might sound like I didn't enjoy the food, but that's not the case. I liked the ingredients in the tacos, especially some of the more acidic/pickled touches. The salad that we had was fabulous!  The margaritas here are great, too. By great I mean better than the Barrio margaritas that everyone raves about. By great I mean miles above your standard Mexican restaurant. By great I mean: potent enough that after two, one of your best friends starts trying to set you up with the waitstaff despite repeated vocal pleas for her not to, your rampant embarrassment, and his polite disinterest. Sorry, Dreamy Bourbon Matt.   Service was legit, food was tasty, margaritas were memorable, price was right. I would truly look forward to my next trip to Bakersfield if I weren't too mortified to ever show my face there again."}
{"text":"This is new to Cleveland and a great addition to the West 25 area. It is pretty popular and always seems to be busy. The tacos are small, but tasty.  The pineapple margaritas are great. Beware, the pitchers are huge and it took three of us all we could to finish it. Delicious, but hard to go back to work after that.   Love the vibe and urban feel. The servers are all upbeat and fun."}
{"text":"Good food. Small portions. If you get Tacos, They are small so you will need at least 2. At $4 each,  this can add up. Did get free refill on chips in chips and salsa order. Nice environment. Little noisy but not bad. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me by how good it was. Hands down one of the best margaritas in Pittsburgh. Food wise, every taco has been amazing but my all time favorites are the guacamole and Jonny salad."}
{"text":"The margaritas are good. I was not impressed with the food. I had a sampling of chips, dips, tacos and chicken. I would not return to eat there. Because of the location and the size of the restaurant, I may return to meet people for drinks if I were downtown."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends, all 4 of us thought the mole tacos were gross.   But $3 shots! Their shot of the day changes daily. We had devil yell whiskey"}
{"text":"Worth the wait for a table on a busy night! The waitstaff and bartender were extremely friendly. The queso is a must! So unique and delicious. The steak taco was phenomenal and the pollo rojo a close second. Overall a great experience for a great value."}
{"text":"I've been to Bakersfield twice and I think I'm hooked. The Guac is to die for and I'm not an avocado girl. The service has been top notch each time and the drinks are great. Wish they had flour tortillas but it's so good I can deal with corn."}
{"text":"Loved it! Simple and easy menu. Nice atmosphere. Food is flavorful and zesty! I got the chicken tostado and it was so yummy. Service was fine- no complaints (we went during the week). Prices aren't bad either. If you're from Cleveland, I would say this is like a higher-end Barrio. Would deff come here again."}
{"text":"Tacos and beautiful sunshine! Well, they can't guarantee sunshine but you'll definitely love the tacos. I adore this corner spot simply because of the roll up windows, introducing fresh air and smiling faces from walkers in the dilworth area.   They offer a variety of beers on draft and by the bottle; reasonably priced with a few being as low as $4. The tacos average about $4/$5 per taco. But keep in mind, they're about 4in so it's recommended that you have 3-4 for a full meal. For a quick lunch, 2 and a drink will serve you just fine.   Overall, I like this place as I've been a few times before on random occasions and the service is always great, drinks are always strong and the food is always fresh. Give them a try... you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Two visits in and this is quickly becoming my new favorite spot for Mexican food and drinks. The menu is small but everything we've tried has been great! They have a nice selection of tequila and the margaritas are tangy and refreshing. The daily $3 shots are a nice plus.  Our server, Haley, had a great sense of humor and provided outstanding service. Her recommendations on tequila selections were spot on. I loved the large windows that open to extend the patio."}
{"text":"I have been to Bakersfield twice, both early Saturday in the afternoon and have loved my experience each time. I originally attempted to go on a Friday night when they first opened but the wait was 2 hours- eek! Other than the expected busy times, if you go doing off hours you'll be greeted, seated, and eating right away. I particularly love the eating right away part, knowing you can sit down order and quickly have your food.   The ambience is cool with the wooden walls and Edison bulbs- it's all very trendy right now and the space doesn't disappoint in that regard. I've only sat on the first floor at the high top tables, so I can't comment on the upstairs but the bar is nice and has a lot of seating.   The food is incredible- probably one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. I'm a creature of habit so both visits I had the same thing- queso with no add ins, guac, and the chicken chorizo tostada. First off, the queso is different than you would typically expect both in taste and texture but it's insanely delicious. Just the look of it alone- caramelized cheese in a cast iron skillet- it's enough to make my heart skip a beat.   The guac is INCREDIBLE as other reviewers have mentioned. It's more on the chunky side, often getting whole pieces of avocado  but who'd be mad at that. The flavor is perfect, no lie. I'm not a huge fan of oniony guac and this is far from that so it rates high in my book.   Chicken chorizo tostado is bomb. It's so so spicy but an amazing combination of flavor and spice without being overbearing. The portion size is not huge but after indulging in chips + then eating this I felt perfectly content.   My fiancé did get tacos during our first visit and mentioned he wasn't super impressed given the size (they are about 4 inches) and price ($4 a pop) - he referred to them as \"trendy tacos\". Although he said the flavor itself was good, he ate 4 and was still a little hungry so I think if your plan is to get tacos, don't come starving or you might spend to get full.   Yesterday, he had the chicken Milanese torta and was impressed and also left full so that was a win.   Last thing I'll mention is the service, or service of one of the wait staff in particular. Her names was beans, or so she told us to call her that. She was super friendly, great personality, very attentive, and even kicked us a free order of chips and salsa because I mentioned my fiancé wanted to leave feeling full. She was also waiting on the tables around us and was engaged in conversation with each. Half the battle in having a good restaurant (outside of the food/cost being good) is having staff that is personable and can provide great customer service. I'm sure we can all agree, it's terrible going out to eat and getting a miserable server. Beans was excellent and seemed like a cool person in general so I definitely hope to visit again and sit with her."}
{"text":"The quest (loaded,  chili and beans and peppers and yummy goodness) is my favorite thing there! The first time I had it I tired the steak taco and the shrimp taco.  The steak literally melted in my mouth.  Be sure to eat quickly because the homemade shells don't hold up well.  Pineapple jalapeno margarita is my favorite drink to have whenever I dine. The last time we went was a Saturday night around 1230 ish and the server sucked.  It was a lady clearly annoyed that we were late diners.  She rushed us the whole time and never refilled our drinks!  If we wanted more drinks we had to make our way to bar. With that being said our party of 5 didn't tip her well due to her own performance. Needless to say I haven't been back since.  I can go to taco bell for average service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met up with our friends and fellow yelpers to pregame and eat dinner. We weren't able to get a table but thankfully we found four seats at the bar. We first order a margarita pitcher to share which was absolutely awesome. Everyone was able to get about 1.5 drinks from the pitcher. Our glasses came with salt around the rim with a lime. I order 3 tacos for dinner. It was plenty to eat in addition with the chips and guacamole we had as appetizer. All the food was delicious and worth the price."}
{"text":"The  ,tacos here were excellent both the pork and the chicken , the premium Margarita is definitely a favorite of my wife . We I hope you had a great server Wendy very polite and a tentative . We can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"So. Friggin. Good.  My hubby and I stumbled upon a Bakersfield while in Nashville, TN and fell in love.  Of course, we were elated to find out there was a restaurant in the 'Burgh! We've been here several times over the past year or so.. each time, it's perfect-o.  The tacos are small, so you can order a few- each one has such distinct, amazing flavors... you can't go wrong.  The gauc is amazing- it's chunky, so you know it's FRESH and the flavor is GREAT.  Another staple is tha queso... it is unlike any queso I've ever had before.. The texture, the flavor, oh- and add the chorizo... you will NOT regret it!!! I almost forgot.. the jalepeno margritas.... YES! So refreshing.. love the citrus-y goodness with a hint of spice! Worth the trip everytime :)"}
{"text":"Came here because I live in the city which this was named after. Thought it was a cute idea, nothing like the real Bakersfield, which is a good thing lol food was a trendy version of Mexican food, not authentic at all. Modern approach to cuisine, if you're looking for authentic, this is not the place. Atmosphere was chill. Really cute inside. Staff was very friendly, I really liked our server, he was funny."}
{"text":"My friends and I came at around 1pm for lunch.  I wasn't too hungry so I only ordered one taco (pork belly). My friend also ordered a pork belly taco and a fish taco. Both tacos were tasty and not too ridiculously priced.   Pork Belly taco 8/10 Fish taco 8/10  I ordered a red wine sangria and it was really refreshing. My friend ordered the Bakersfield Margarita. It was a tad bit strong but my friend said it tasted good.   Overall, the food is good but the service was definitely not up to par. Our server Amy took 10+ minutes to acknowledge us, 15+ minutes to come back with our waters, and forgot to bring us the lemons that my friend asked for. I don't think she even smiled once at us.   Our margaritas and sangrias also came after I had already eaten half of my taco. I had to ask another waitress to check on our drinks.   The service is a 3/10 but the food is a 8/10."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great liquor specials ($3 shots of whiskey or tequila which varies daily). Highly recommend the Short Rib Torta. The location could be better but does not take away from the awesome experience."}
