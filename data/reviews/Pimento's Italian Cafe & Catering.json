{"text":"We picked up a pizza from here to try the full meal deal so I thought I would give an update. Still the same fresh, quality pizza - just like the flowers. We both really liked this pizza - neither of us felt greased out and I wasn't laid out on the couch with pizza belly. The only problem was that the pizza could have been cooked another couple of minutes in my opinion, the crust was just a touch doughy.

I do have a different kind of complaint though - I don't care much for their website. I can't find the business address at all on there - why is it so hard to find? I assume because they have a food truck? I dunno. I also couldn't call in to order pizza. I tried the number many times but it must be for catering orders or something only? The only way to order our pizza was to walk into the shop and order. Then we sat in the car and waited because it's so small in there. At least it's quick - about 15 min for our 'za.

The flowers are still the bomb in my opinion. Hot n' fresh. I still dig the grab n' go aspect. I say go for the flowers if you are interested in checking this place out. Need to add - beware when you are eating one of the flowers! It's messy and runny but so good. Can't reccomend eating it in the car. It's almost best to stand and eat it, seems to be the nature of the beast. A lot of juice (not grease!) comes from the sauce or something - so beware or you will get burned! 

OR you can go the route of having a big messy stain on your shirt and looking like Pig Pen for the rest of the day. You choose."}
{"text":"Serves unique pizza and kinda home made style ice cream.
Hidden place in the bridgeland community. I dropped by there on my bike ride trip.. Very small but the service was friendly and it's surprisingly busy!.. (that's why it's a lil bit slow I guess...one man shop)
The only thing is this place only accepts cash (not sure if if it's just for that day or always like that). There's a ATM right around the corner. 

Check it out if u happen to b in that neighborhood:)!"}
{"text":"I walked into Pimento's last night for my second time ever. Chef Mario remembered me as \"the vegan baking lady\" from the exchange we last had over a year ago. This continued as another customer walked in. He and the other staff member knew her name, inquired about her wedding that weekend, and talked as old friends.This is the mark of a truly remarkable, personable small business owner, and I only hope to treat my customers this way if I ever own an establishment myself. 

The good impressions don't stop there. I ordered the Giardino without cheese, wif more veggies. The lovely lady taking my order reminded him of this, but he remembered my restrictions from last time, \"An Italian girl who cannot eat the salami. I pray for you every night.\" So does my grandmother, Mario. Don't even worry about it. 

I watched as he made our pizza flowers before our eyes- these are like mini pizzas with a stem. If ever a handsome Italian man is crazy enough to marry me despite my irrational dietary restrictions, I kind of want this to be my bouquet; pomodoro, black olives, mushrooms, green peppers, red onions, fresh tomatoes, and artichoke hearts, with an adorable spear of green olives in the middle! One thing I did do when I got home, is shred some vegan daiya cheese onto it to see what it was like, but these cones are amazing both ways! So remarkably fresh. 

 I love this place, it feels down home and makes me want to write a Jim Jarmusch-esque film about it, documenting all the exchanges of dialogue that occur as Mario perfects your pizza (think Coffee and Cigarettes). Toss out your cell phones (this charming business owner tells me he hates computers, which might explain the website). Walk into this pizzeria and place your order, like the socially capable person you are. Sit on the bench, and watch your pizza be made before your eyes, make conversation. Be completely enchanted for a a little while. These cones are best eaten on a beautiful day, slumped outside on a step or curb on the streets of Bridgeland, formerly known as \"Little Italy.\""}
