{"text":"Wonton Gourmet is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, and the majority Asian clientele would seem to agree. It's a rather small restaurant, with an austere ambiance. There are probably 20 or so tables, mostly 2 and 4-tops, but there are a few larger round tables that can sit 6-10 people.

They have two menus: one for the non-Asians with most of the \"typical\" American-Chinese dishes like sweet and sour shrimp, General Tso's chicken, and eggrolls; and one that is all written in Chinese, which includes items most of us white folk wouldn't know about, and that might push some of our limits for what we feel comfortable eating, like frog, pig intestine, or beef tendon. Please note, my previous statement is not a judgement of Chinese food, but more of a remark on the somewhat limited palate of the \"average\" American.  I feel I should note that I happen to like beef tendon.

I would recommend avoiding the more typical American-Chinese dishes. You can find those in any Chinese restaurant in Ohio, and Wonton Gourmet doesn't do anything special with them.  If you can read Chinese, or find a friend who does, try exploring the \"real\" menu.

We go here once or twice a month, and I'm fortunate that my partner reads Chinese, so we have access to both menus. This is helpful, because although they have a lot of their menu spread out across the walls of the restaurant with color photos of the dishes, it's hard to know what's in many of them, beyond their names.  For example, \"Hong Kong style noodle soup,\" doesn't provide much insight, other than the fact it's a noodle soup that is typical of the former UK colony.

I have had a few mediocre dishes there. I happen to feel that the HK Style soup is bland and not worth the calories. I also had a beef and vegetable low mein that was flavorless. But for the most part, I have enjoyed their food. They have a great beef and tendon stew in a clay pot, a deliciously rich bamboo and mushroom sautee, a wonderfully crispy wok-fried chow mein, and many others.

Don't expect to be bowled over by ambiance, customer service or presentation, but overall, if you're interested in exploring authentic regional Chinese cuisine, you'll probably have a good time.  You should also be aware that it gets very busy for brunch/lunch on the weekends - they serve some traditional Chinese breakfast foods, not typical brunch fare that you'll find at an American restaurant - so if you go between 10:30A and 1P, there could be a wait."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Chinese place in Ohio.  I was very impressed by their extensive menu and items we ordered were very tasty.  Run by a Cantonese family but they get a lot of Taiwanese or Mainland China students from Cleveland U eating there.  Pleasantly surprised that such a place even exists in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"Picked up my takeout order and from the look inside the restaurant, combined with the weight of the four items I ordered, I was really excited - from reading reviews, I expected to be really happy and satisfied with their food. 

I ordered two small wonton soups, house potstickers, ma la jon tung choy, and beef chow fun. The wonton soup and potstickers were fine, despite the wontons being super dense. 

As soon as I opened the ma la jon tung choy, I was extremely offput. The greens were an overdone dark green color and kind of mushy, they also reeked of shrimp paste, and I ended up throwing them away after one taste.

The beef chow fun was flavorless and the beef was scarce. There was zero sauce on the noodles or beef, and the beef was also overdone."}
{"text":"Best authentic chinese food I have come across. I have come to Cleveland mutiple times just to come to this restaurant and eat their shrimp wonton soup. I'm from Detroit, so its about a 3 and a half hour drive, but it is so worth the drive. The food here is so good. My favorite dish is the chicken hot pot. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Rating this place high for hours, taste, quality and value. My husband and I discovered it a few months ago and were really impressed with the authenticity of the menu. I tried a dish that was new to me and was blown away by it. The dish was a type of dumpling, similar to a gnocchi, but not made with potato. 

We returned last night (Saturday) after a show at Playhouse Square. I called ahead to make sure they were still open and yes, they were open until Midnight. Huge win if you've ever struggled to find a place to eat past 10 or 11pm in this city. 

When you walk in you are greeted promptly by the owner with a big smile. While the seating options are limited in this small and very practical layout, he'll always ask you if the seat he offers you is OK. The tea that arrives almost immediately is loose leaf, and has a wonderful sweet flavor with no bitter taste to it. The woody bits and green leaves give it a gentle color and aroma that never turns too dark or intense over the course of the meal.

I've noticed there are two menus: the one they give you when seated, and the one sitting on the table. I think you can order from either. In fact, I think you can order whatever you want, and they will make it for you. I heard the owner talking with a customer at the table behind me about some food - a certain style oyster - that this customer had while he was abroad.  The owner said, \"Yes, yes, we can do that...come in next week and we'll have it for you, OK?\"

Some people measure the authenticity of an ethnic restaurant by the number of cultural natives at the place. Judging by last night's crowd, this  one is the real deal. At 10:30 at night, there were tables and tables of Asian families dining, some large eating family style, others small enjoying a dinner date.

We ordered the chive pot stickers and a plate of fried rice \"young chow,\" which meant it had shrimp, ham, roasted pork, egg, cabbage, carrots, and peas. The potstickers were absolutely delicious, and the fried rice was perfection. If you think you've had fried rice at some places, you haven't had fried rice until you've had it here. Light, savory, and \"fresh\" is the best way I know how to describe it. You don't feel like you're eating a heart attack on a plate the way you can with some places' fried rice.  My husband also ordered a plate of chicken, which was perfectly sautee'd, not too greasy, and seasoned perfectly. 

Our bill for all this heaven was only $23. And we have enough left over for lunch today. Amazing."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its small footprint. This is a high high quality Chinese restaurant. It is very very clean inside, top class compared to most Chinese restaurant type, definitely the top one in Cleveland.

The food is not just authentic, it is very good. It is comparable to the very good ones in San Francisco. The price is reasonable too because they provide all kind of small dishes. I do feel that if you count the price per pound, it is more expensive than most in Cleveland area. In my opinion, it totally worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, not only the food is great, the service is awesome.

I went there today for a take-out since it was so crowded for dining-in. I ordered and waited in the parking lot for a good half hour - after that, I went in and was told my order was ready so I took the whole thing without even checking if that was the correct order (since I can't read Chinese).

I went home and realized the order was wrong - I called the place and a very nice lady offered to deliver my food right away and told us to keep the food that we already got. Half hour later, our food arrived, my offer to tip was completely rejected.

I am very satisfied with the service as well and I will definitely recommend going there to anyone."}
{"text":"Every time I come back to Cleveland, I must have a meal at Wonton Gourmet & BBQ!  Don't believe my grand opinion of their establishment?  Just look inside on the weekends around lunch.  It's packed with Asian locals and people of different races!  This place just makes great food, quickly and cheap!

All their soup noodles are delicious.  I like the shrimp wonton noodle soup.  

Their hot entrees are also delectable:
Japanese Tofu
Hot & Spicy Fish Fillet
Fried Turnip cakes
 
the list goes on and on.  

*drooling*  I miss you already."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I craved some authentic chinese food.  Even though I'm not Cantonese,  my parents have lived there for awhile so my meals consisted of Cantonese food. Being in the restaurant made me nostalgic.  
Anyway, back to the food, we got mo po tofu, beef chow fun and some pancakes. Everything was really good. The tofu had the perfect spice. The only thing I regret was not inviting more people so I could order more food. I want to try their bbq pork chops, wonton noodle soup, and their milk tea next time. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time I went it was delicious. But maybe that's because my parents ordered the food and know how to order authentic chinese. We got the cirspy shrimp which was delicious, along with a tofu dish, spicy fish, etc. All was very good. Second time I went I got the duck dinner, not as good. The duck was old and over-fried. Last time I went I ordered a ma po tofu with pork and they cooked the vegetarian mapo tofu, which had huge chunks of ginger in it and was not good. I'll still go back though, probably the best authentic chinese around."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times since first being recommended by a Chinese friend.  The first 3 times were good. Last night it was horrible.  The eggplant was bland and the bamboo tasted spoiled.  So I averaged my review from my four visits.  It may change since I order something different every time.  Maybe its because I spent a year in Shanghai. Go fig."}
{"text":"Drive here from canton just to eat   Food is the best Chinese my wife an ive had.  Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. This past weekend my brother came to visit from out of town and we took him here. We ordered the salted fried pork chops with spicy garlic and roast duck along with some bubble teas. It was delicious. My brother loved it."}
{"text":"Excellent Hong Kong style noodle soup with shrimp dumplings! That alone makes it worth the visit and the bowl is so big, you can call it a meal. Some of the other dishes though are hit or miss; I got a rice plate with beef and vegetables and was unimpressed. No Asian veggies in it, just celery and carrots. Nonetheless I'm eager to go back and try some of the other dishes. NOTE! They have 3 different menus, and if you go during lunch and you're not Asian, you'll get the \"boring honky menu.\" If you want the serious Hong Kong dishes, order from the pictures posted on the wall or from the Chinese menu."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of Northeast Ohio! It's seriously authentic! My favorite items: the wonton noodle soup and their steamed oysters! I've also tried their clay pots, and those are great too! We need more places like this in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This is definently a case against judging a book by it's cover. Wonton Gourmet could be mistaken as an ordinary Chinese restaurant in a strip mall, but it is so much more. The second you step through the door the tantalizing smell of authentic Chinese food will hit you. Once seated there is hot green tea waiting for you at the table. Across the walls are pictures of every item on the menu, luckily we were eating with regulars who knew all the best dishes. We had hot and spicy fish, salt bake pork chops, chili chicken, cumin lamb, shrimp wonton soup, and a type of cabbage with a taste similar to bok choy. Everything was delicious, but the cumin lamb, and the hot and spicy fish were especially superb. Both dishes were prepared with finesse and the deep spicy flavor in each one was perfectly balanced with the other flavors. The fish was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the lamb was executed with perfection. This is the best Chinese food I have ever had in my life, you will be missing out without taking a trip to Wonton Gourmet."}
{"text":"For me this place is just OK. We have beef chow fun,wonton noodle soup ,roast duck and general Tso's chicken.
The wonton noodles soup was pretty good the best in Cleveland. But the chow fun is very greasy  and not much taste,the roast duck is dry and the same with the chicken. 
They use a lot of MSG there after I ate there I have to drink a lot of water."}
{"text":"I just visited Cleveland for the Labor Day weekend. After driving back from Canton and a visit to the Football HOF, I was famished. Not much was open after  10 pm in the city, except bars. i accidentally stumbled onto this place and was more than pleasantly surprised. 

Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly waiter who ushered me to a table and within a few seconds I had a piping hot pot of tea. The waiter recommended a steak entree and I took him up on it. WOWZER! To my surprise, for just $10.95 I received a platter of excellent spiced steak, cut into pieces, along with a bowl of steamed rice. The meat was so tender it required no knife to cut it, fork tender. The waiter was great and attentive without being disruptive. The cashier also stopped by to check on my satisfaction. Really, really, good food, combined with excellent service. These people really care about your experience. My favorite dining experience in Cleveland by far, was my most unexpected find."}
{"text":"This restaurant is authentic Chinese with 3 very large menus.  Pictures on the wall help make it simple to choose.   The sizzling beef was good quality meat. Although it wasn't listed as spicy, it definitely had some zing. The shrimp and broccoli had lots of nice fresh vegetables.  A large side of rice accompanied our meals. The pot stickers were average, but the egg roll was great. My only wish is that they would offer a sampler platter so you could try a little bit of everything.  I would love to try jellyfish and other more exotic listings, but I  don't know that I  could eat a whole plate full."}
{"text":"Dine in or carry out this is one of the best in Cleveland. The Chinese sausage fried rice and pork pan fried noodles are a couple of our favorites."}
{"text":"I tried to order food before they were closed and they refused me. That's fucked up. Honor the hours you claim you're open."}
{"text":"I wish I could be here right now.  Huge portions of authentic Chinese food (or as Americanized as you want) with friendly service and rock-bottom prices.  While we were a bit overwhelmed with the number of choices available, everything we tried was absolutely delicious and we left stuffed and happy :)."}
{"text":"When I crave authentic Chinese I come here. Some must haves sweet and sour bbq pork chops, spicy black bean clams, and salt and pepper calamari. The flavor is just right and it hits the spot when I start thinking about the food I grew up with."}
{"text":"Real Chinese food. Make sure to order off the Hong Cong menu. Three flavor shrimp dumpling soup is amazing."}
{"text":"I love it!! Only downside is staff is not friendly at all. Most of them barely speak English. That  part makes it more authentic. They have three menus one is just American Chinese and the rest real Chinese!! 

Delish and very inexpensive. Neighborhood slightly sketchy."}
{"text":"This terrific restaurant was busy at 8PM on Sunday night.   The Orange Beef was delicious and the Sweet and Sour Chicken was great.    The service was fine."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp for a restaurant to go to the day after Christmas because no one wanted leftovers.  Wonton seemed to have good reviews so I drove from Beachwood to 30th and Payne.  We ordered General Tso chicken, ham egg foo young,  shrimp fried rice and beef with Chinese vegetables.  The price was reasonable about $40. The food was just ok. Not great but not offensive either.  Then my mom bit down on something and after examination we thought that it was a chicken bone fragment.  Ok...a short time later I had the ham egg foo young and bit down on a couple of bone fragments.  At least I hope that's what it was. There shouldn't have been any bones in ham egg foo young.  Needless to say I won't go back."}
{"text":"The Food was great to fantastic, But I like Hunan East on Richmond Rd. better. A helluva lotta food for the price. I chose some of the Hong Kong (authentic Chinese) fare such as the Fried Turnip Cakes and all Flavors Shrimp Wonton Soup  for an appetizer; my two guests played it safe stuffed wonton. All were good but fried turnips is an acquired taste..had a ting of a fish taste. We ordered three entrees to share; Chicken Chop Suey, , Szechuan Shrimp (spicy) and me the Seafood Pot...all were exquisite! They almost ruined my night by adding an $8.67 for a group of three folk...it almost seemed like that stereotype thing; that we black folk don't tip. normally tip at about 20% so the waitress cheated herself out of about $4.00 tip of a $57.00 bill. I also tip with cash! Ha Ha! Despite that slight I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food. This restaurant is actually run and the food prepared authentically. The service is good and fast. The portions are large and inexpensive. Very kid friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, this is Cleveland.  It's not Toronto, it's not New York and it's not San Francisco.  Least of all it's not Taipei or Beijing or a lot of other places.  However, the food here is pretty decent.  Was there today and three of us had Seafood w noodles, egg fooyung, Szechuan pork with eggplant, pot stickers and ung choy (similar to spinach).  The ung choy was excellent.  The seafood w noodles was close to excellent.  The Szechuan pork was good.  The egg fooyung was so so.  The Szechuan dishes -- which are supposed to be spicy were a bit tame and a tiny bit oily.  But, there is a spicy chili sauce on the table which was quite helpful.  Folks, this is as good as it gets in Cleveland for Chinese and it's not bad.   This place would have dfficulty surviving in Toronto, but Toronto has a huge Chinese immigrant population, we don't.   I'll go back.  The food is served 'family style.'  That means when your order a dish, that dish is intended to serve about four people.  The servings are generous.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  After eating we stopped at Park To Shop.  I love the fact that you can buy a huge bag of frozen custard (dessert) bao (buns) for $4.29 there.  I suspect that these are the same buns that Li Wah serves as part of their dim sum offerings."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese spot in town - that was before the previous owner sold the business to some new guy. Now everything is just downslope. The older waiter is rude and cold; there are no services to be expected from him. The quality of ingredients is deteriorating. I just had some mold bok choy last night and the owner told me all bok choy was like that...

In contrast, the former owner was warm and you could always expect efficient services here. Although to be fair, we did have a couple of times when quality wasn't consistent or there was hair in the dishes. But at least they didn't try to find lame excuses and was always quick to resolve issues. Before, I would happily give it 4 stars. Now, it barely deserves 2. 

It's too bad with Wonton Gourmet on my blacklist now, there are only 3-4 decent Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  We tried this place out after reading reviews on yelp!  Actually, it was the pictures of the different dishes on yelp! that did it. First of all, please don't judge this place by its location or how it looks from the outside (or inside for that matter).  As we were walking in, there were folks coming out with carry out. The first thing I noticed was all of the Asian patrons. I think that is a good indication of the authenticity of the cuisine. The second thing that I noticed was all of the numbered pictures on the wall corresponding to some of the menu items. Thank God for those because I have to say the number of choices, on three different menus, is \"overwhelming\" (in my wife's words). Yes, three different menus....we didn't really use any of them and used the pictures instead. 

Here's what we ordered:
Tea; Shrimp wonton soup; XO Seafood Fried Rice; Beef Chow Fun. 

Our food literally came out within 5-minutes and the portion sizes were humongous.  The fried rice was probably the best I've had and the beef chow fun was on point. The soup was my least favorite, but I imagine if I was really in the mood for soup I may have enjoyed it more. The shrimp stuffed inside the wontons were a nice size. 

Overall, I felt like I was in an authentic Chinese restaurant with the background noise filled with Chinese patrons speaking their native language and a Chinese news broadcast on the television. I can't wait to come back to try some of the other dishes on the menu, ahem, I mean the wall."}
{"text":"FOOD:
Best authentic Chinese food in Cleveland. I have pretty high standards for my Chinese food, and that's coming from a Chinese New Yorker.  I have tried many restaurants in Cleveland, and so far the others (Hunan East, Lai Wah, Siam Cafe, etc) don't compare. I come here about every two weeks and everything on the menu is good. Nothing they serve has been bad so far, but I would suggest avoiding the menu that has your typical American Chinese take-out. The wall is full of pictures end to end, that can serve as a good guide on what to order. Some of my favorites so far are: Garlic snow pea tips (kinda like Chinese spinach), Chive dumplings, Hong Kong style Lo Mein, Cumin beef, and XO fried rice. 

Pricing is very reasonable and they give you a large serving. If you order one dish per person, you'll definitely have tons of leftovers at the end. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Very casual place with its wooden tables and chairs, and fairly small. And honestly, you can easily drive by it without noticing it. But don't let looks fool you! If you want a nicer more formal atmosphere, Lai Wah down the street might be better. But the food and pricing at Wonton is unbeatable, that I always come here."}
{"text":"This place was a late night choice made from our hotel room after a long day of driving. This place reminded me a little of any really good Chinese place in Austin where you hardly find \"whitey\". The walls of the place were covered in delicious looking photo's of the menu. The waitstaff was very polite and excited about us being there. We sampled there marinated chicken which was the moistest thing I have ever eaten. We also had there chive pot stickers which were very nice. A Wonton soup with bok choy. Finally some pork chop dish which was tasty and different. Our dog Bella was happy to try the left overs when we got back to the hotel. I hope to try this place again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously. Best. Chinese. Ever.

My boyfriend decided he wanted Chinese food today and I wasn't really feeling it. Gosh, am I glad I got hungry and didn't have any other suggestions because this changed me. For real. 

We decided to each get a soup and then get something else to split. I had the shrimp wonton soup with noodles. Fantastic. The broth wasn't hot salt water; it actually tasted like broth. Delicious, satisfying broth. This is the kind of dish that I'll crave. You know when you just remember a flavor and you know when you want that certain food, it's supposed to be that way? This wonton soup is most definitely going to be that kind of dish for me. Next time I want some wonton soup, it will be that soup that I'm wanting. 

The other dish we had was the beef and broccoli. I don't normally eat beef when I get Chinese food, but I'm (once again) glad I let someone else make this decision because it definitely wasn't a bad one! The beef was tender and the brown sauce, to quote my boyfriend, was surprisingly NOT sugary. It had full flavor, less sugar, and I actually didn't leave here regretting the amount of food that I had. I didn't feel like going into a food coma from the heaviness of the food and sugars/oils used. 

Finishing touch: really tasty orange slices. I don't even like oranges and I enjoyed these. 

Bottom line: flavorful and authentic."}
{"text":"Real deal Chinese, helped by many dish-pictures hanging on the wall.  you can get a little bit of everything here from noddle dishes, hearty soups, great wontons, fried rice, etc.

We shared several dishes, a heaping bowl of soup with three different kinds of shrimp wontons and an order of pot stickers that was the hidden gem of the meal.

If you are near downtown and want to find an authentic spot in Chinatown, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Yes! Looking for something local and good- great way to close our Great Lakes journey. Ma Po Tofu, hot & spicy beef and the Szechuan eggplant and chicken were all great! We threw in a Chinese sausage fried rice for good measure."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Chinese food in Cleveland. As a kid, my dad took my brother and I there a lot and so it holds a really special place in our hearts. The food is always amazing. They have pictures on the walls that you can order from and sometimes I go by just that and really have no idea what I ordered, but everything is delicious. The restaurant itself is small and cozy. Seriously, I don't think there's better Chinese food in the city. Plus the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with amazing food. The cumin lamb was delicious but spicy. Has the house bean curd without pork- it's basically tofu with veggies. Tofu was seasoned well but I wasn't crazy about the mushrooms that came with it but I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms. Well priced too & large portions. Will definitely come again- lot of things on the menu I want to try!"}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet has quickly become one of my favorite go-to spots in Cleveland! Too often, quality Chinese food is rare in less diverse Midwestern areas such as Columbus. You're often left with dry sesame chicken and undercooked rice. Cleveland, however, has really lucked out with Wonton Gourmet! The service, food, and welcoming ambiance are beyond compare in the world of American Chinese restaurants. 

Every time I have visited Wonton, the service is prompt and attentive, even when I have visited later at night and with large groups. The servers are helpful and offer many insights into the menus. The long list of menu items is conveniently pictured along the walls, and they encourage standing up and walking around to make sure you know exactly what you're ordering. The feel of the restaurant is so welcoming that often, other tables tell you what they love ordering to help you make your decision. Pro tip: the best item I've ordered is #40: seafood with fried noodles!

I love the servers here as well - they are friendly and never judge an inexperienced diner! They also box up your food for you at the end. 

While it's in the heart of Midtown, I have never felt unsafe visiting this restaurant, even in high school when my friend's mom screamed at us to run inside quickly before immediately locking her doors and speeding away in her Honda minivan. It's a nice oasis in the middle of Cleveland, and I am already craving my fried noodles again!"}
{"text":"The food here is the best in Cleveland, in my humble opinion, for authentic Chinese.  We order here frequently to go, and have dined in a few times.  The Salted Baked Pork Chop is fried deliciousness.  I would eat the bones if I could, and I am not one of those people who like to eat fat, but seriously these pork chops are picked CLEAN.  It helps that it is crispy and well cooked.  Our kids LOVE the beef with Chinese broccoli.  Lots of flavor, but the sauce is actually surprisingly light.  Tons of veggies make this a dinner out option you don't need to feel guilty giving the kids.  Chive potsickers...OMG...little salty bursts of onion and pork in homemade noodle, awesome.

Other options I've had that I enjoyed, but may be an acquired taste, are the spicy fish (super spicy, yum!! Not the hubbys fav tho!), calamari with black bean sauce (calamari in very long tubes, I wasn't a huge fan of the chewiness, but still good), and the hot and spicy beef noodle soup (soup flavor was great, but on the oily side, and HUGE pieces of brisket, but me being me I had to trim the fat down on these).

You may ask why 4 stars?  Well, this is in Asia town and has a very strong Asian clientele, which is never a bad thing!  However not speaking the language puts a bit more \"distance\" between yourself and the staff, and we have definitely felt the service at times was a bit indifferent.  Not rude, not bad, but you know when you say a joke or smile and it just crashes against the brick wall that is your server? Yes, that.  But don't let that stop you from being adventurous and relying on the pictures on the wall if you need help ;)"}
{"text":"This is seriously good Chinese food. I find it difficult to make a trip for a sit-down Chinese meal with my picky-eater friends. So, this rare trip to a real Chinese restaurant with my super-adventurous family over the Thanksgiving day weekend was a real treat. 
After a visit to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame and not wanting to rush back to Mashed potato and stuffing left-overs, my parent knew there was a good Chinese noodle place with lines down the street most weekdays. My trusty Yelp app gave me turn by turn directions to Wonton Gourmet in Cleveland's \"Chinatown\" (it's like 5 buildings with Chinese writing within a few blocks).  The photos were really helpful, except the portion sizes were deceiving in that the objects in image may appear smaller than real life!
For 3 people, we ordered the three flavour shrimp dumpling soup with noodles, stir fried noodles with seafood, and MY FAVE: Szechuan fish. 
The fish comes with rice and about 6 whole fish worth of bone-free fish steaks swimming in a bright red garlic and chili broth. There are a few slices of cabbage on the bottom, but this one came home with us and was a huge hit! 
When we got it packed up to go, the server gave us some extra rice! 
How's that for supplementing Turkey Day-after leftovers? Yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Chinese food . My favorite is spicy fish and spicy beef. Service is ok. But the inside needs some remodeling..."}
{"text":"Another great meal.  Tried the bamboo and mushrooms and it didn't disappoint. Wish it was in a better neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is THE place to go in Cleveland for authentic Asian food. I usually come here with a group of people and we share a bunch of dishes family style. This is a great place to do that, because the portions here are large and meant to be shared. This place is also good for a date, and my boyfriend and I love going here and sharing 2 dishes. We always have leftovers for a midnight snack. But I will have to admit, the ambiance is not really that romantic, so this place is not really for a 1st date, it's fine for a 96th date once you're comfortable enough with each other. Usually a meal here is $12-15 per person including tip. 

Service: Always great! The servers are really friendly and always smiling. They are really accommodating too, like once we asked if they would change the channel on their TV, and they did. Another time, my friend was not happy with her food and they took it off the bill. 

Food: OMG so good! I'll order the dishes from best to worst. We usually get the hot and spicy fish (which is very hot and spicy and flavorful). We also get the salted baked calamari or salted baked seafood, which is always fantastic. Sometimes we get the fish with sour vegetables, which I love but some of my friends think is too sour. We usually get veggie dishes as well: the Szechuan eggplant is may absolute favorite (even better with pork), the gai lan and kong shin tsai are also very good. The meat dishes are usually okay, we get the beef shortribs and cumin lamb, but the meat isn't always as tender as I'd like. The mapo tofu and Szechuan chicken here are not my favorite. 

Overall, this place is great for an awesome Chinese meal. Expect to have an excellent time and to be super full after leaving."}
{"text":"They dish up great HK style street food. Fantastic noodle soups. The dumpling soup is one of my faves here.   My type of comfort food.

Their HK milk tea (hot and cold) is fantastically delicious, like what you would expect to get in Hong Kong. I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner the last time few times I was there, he actually imports the tea leaves from HK to ensure the authentic taste!  It is actually a mix of 2-3 types of tea leaves.  So if you order HK milk tea elsewhere and you a given a cup with a lipton label hanging out the side, sorry, that's not the real deal..."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic food with so many choices that you could eat there for many weeks and still not try everything on the menu.  Though it is authentic and tasty, I felt like it wasn't special enough to make me miss my usual Chinese spot.  

But you know this place has to be good when you see many tables and the waitlist full of Chinese families."}
{"text":"Ok.... After eating a lot of Chinese food in NYC ...I found Cleveland lacking big time ! UNTIL .... I had dinner at Wonton . The restaurant is not going to win any decoration and ambiance awards,and i dont care. Just look at the walls and pick a number of the picture of the dish you want. The best Wonton soup I ever had....the broth tasted like they were boiling chickens in back...lol. Best dish was the eggplant..first  time eating it. Bring friends and sit at the revolving table...you get too much food !!!"}
{"text":"Truly a legit Asian establishment. I swear they have a million pictures on the wall to confuse the hell out of you. Through my experience eating here, I would recommend the spicy fish, jade tofu, the greens, house dumplings, and eggplant something I can't recall. They even have the HK style baked pork chop but it takes unusually long for them to make the order, so I don't see it worth the time. 

And it's no doubt ALWAYS open. Always."}
{"text":"I would say this is the most authentic chinese food you will get in cleveland!  It's a hole in the wall type building, but inside is decent, has pics of food on the wall. I have been here a few times and I'm quite satisified with the food. I like the fried rice and the (lo mein) wide noodle with gravy."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cantonese food. My go to place. Fast and fresh. I always order the bitter melon with shrimp and three soup with noodles. Wonton Gourmet has never let me down."}
{"text":"Very authentic Hong Kong style food. The restaurant is clean and service is good. I ordered beef stew over rice. The sauteed clam (#33) also looks very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, have I not written a review for Wonton Gourmet & BBQ?   Wow... how very negligent of me.  This is, without a doubt in my mind, the very best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.  It is one of the things that convinced me an American born Chinese who is quite picky about my Chinese food that I could build a life in Cleveland.  

You can read more about it from other reviews here, but I just wanted to toss out some dishes that we love in my house- the Jade Tofu w/ battered fish, the turnip cakes (whoa, delish!), the \"salted baked pork chop\" and by \"baked\" they mean perfectly deep fried so that they are crispy, tender and amazing.  I have never had a bad meal here- the staff is busy but always courteous.  Watch out for your car as it is not in the best neighborhood, but just don't leave valuables out and you'll be fine.

Portions are good- I always order more than I can eat so I can take it home and enjoy it for a couple more meals.  I wish this place was closer to my house- I'd go all the time.  Just look at the pictures on the wall and choose a couple things that look good- please don't waste your time and money ordering crummy American-Chinese food like egg rolls and general tso's chicken.  Try things out- I'm pretty sure you'll like most of what you eat and you'll broaden your culinary horizons!"}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet has an impressive offering of classic Cantonese dishes but their execution is average. I can see that this place is good for Cleveland, but it's not so good compared to the better Chinese restaurants in New York City.  I had the wonton noodle soup -- the noodles were great, but the broth had a disappointingly muddied flavor. I don't like beef chow fun unless it's made really, really well, and here it was far too greasy. We were very happy to find that they had snow pea shoots sauteed in garlic, but while the vegetables were fresh, they were coated in too much salt and MSG. The serving sizes of these dishes were unnecessarily big and we didn't want to take the leftovers with us. The waiters are very pleasant but the food took a long time to come out. It appeared that people who had ordered takeout were waiting a long time, too."}
{"text":"Great food, fried pork chops, orange beef all very good. Also well packaged. The only criticism I would have is that their crab Rangoon needs work. I would try something else I wouldn't order that again."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I noticed that the vast majority of customers were Chinese (which is a great thing if you enjoy authentic Chinese food). They have a decent selection of wontons and other HK favorites like fried dough with noodles. The portions are big and the prices are decent.  I'd also recommend coming here for a traditional Cantonese breakfast (congee and fried beef noodles)."}
{"text":"If this is \"authentic\" hong kong food like my friend states, I'm going to have to cancel any future tickets to Hong Kong I may have.  Maybe growing up in the suburbs has given my palate a bias towards Americanized Chinese food, 'cause this stuff I just couldn't stomach.

Much of the food is way too oily.  It's a shame really cause the sauce tasted good but it was just swimming in oil.  I need to find me a PF Chang (don't hate)."}
{"text":"They have completely turned this place around- before the place wasn't very clean!! The new owners have made this place very cozy, warm and clean.  I also like how they have pictures of the dishes on the walls, so you know exactly what you're ordering and it won't be something completely random

The food is delicious and fresh.  I love their fried Peking ribs and salt baked lobster.  The Peking ribs are crispy and the sauce has a slight tanginess with sweetness and hits of worchestshire sauce. The salt baked lobster is cooked in a way that locks in the fresh seafood flavor without any fishiness. The lobster is cooked with hot red and served with fresh green chilies.  The vegetables are fresh, but the vegetables are stir-fried in the same oil that the chiles are cooked in, adding heat the veggies.  While I love spicy food, I don't need my vegetables to be spicy.

The service/waiting time to get your entree  is a little long, but worth the wait once you're there.  It has 3.75-4 stars, instead of five, for less than speedy service/waiting time and the spicy oil that the veggies are stir-fried in.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I came here with a party of 10 for dinner on a Saturday night. I called ahead and they were able to hold a table for us which was nice. 

We ordered about 7 different dishes and shared it family style. It is kind of a typical Chinese restaurant where the waiters arent checking up on you...but we were easily able to get our waiter's attention when needed. Whenever we needed something (whether that be more rice, more utensils or more tea) the waiters were very friendly and gave us what we needed in a timely manner. 

Everything we ordered was tasty and came out quickly! The only dish I wasn't a fan of was the chili chicken...which was dry and more breading than meat. The menu is fairly big and accommodates to many different taste buds. The portions are also generous and prices are fair, allowing us to spend about $11 per person after tip. Totally worth!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place other than that everything I tried on the menu was pretty great and the prices were in line with what you might expect. Whether you expect something \"Americanized\" or more traditional you should enjoy your meal at this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service overall. They even gave us complementary fruit slices when they presented us the bills!"}
{"text":"Had hopped to give this a better review but the food was off.  We had had duck but it was so salty, boney and fatty.  Second dish was Governors Chicken that was too mild.  We asked it for it not to be spicy and they ended up putting in no spice.

Decor is sort of tacky with all the signs of the dishes and prices.  It looks like they have not changed that in a while.  There are lots of choices.

The service was good and prices reasonable.  The portions are large for dinner plates."}
{"text":"The food is the best Chinese food in town, hands down. Unfortunately their customer service ruins the dining experience. We had to wait almost 20 minutes until we had an interaction with our waitress. She speaks/understands little to no English. Not only did they bring all four dishes out at separate times, they had no explanation for the last dish (which came out 40 minutes into the meal). Not even an apology! A bit of courtesy and attentiveness to the diners experience goes a long way. To top it off, the waitress hovered over us to hurry up and sign the checks in order to seat another table in our spot, and mind you I had finally just received my dish (which was just above room temperature). I understand that we came during a busy time (and I've had similar experiences dining here when it was not during peak times), but Wonton needs to understand that it's not only the food that makes the experience of dining with close ones special, but also the customer/employee relationship that occurs during that time."}
{"text":"We had take out from her last night. It was delicious! I had the orange chicken, fried rice, and egg roll. My husband had the schezwan shrimp. We both had taro bubble tea. The food was huge portions and awesome, the tea wasn't that great. All for $23 though! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I am 100% Cantonese and lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for 18 years. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place several years ago and regularly go here for my fix of traditional Cantonese favorites. It's not the most amazing Cantonese food I've ever had, but considering this is Cleveland, I have to give them mad props. This is a no-frills Chinese place, just the way I like it. The waitresses can sometimes be coarse or in a hurry, but just be patient. You're here for the food, not the service.

I love the noodle soups. I don't like seafood/wonton, so I usually opt for roast pork, roast duck or braised beef with it. Eating here almost tastes like home and makes me pretty happy. The portion sizes are reasonable and with tax and tip, I usually pay about $9. If you get it with rice instead, it comes with sweet soy sauce; be sure to ask for it on the side if you do. They can sometimes drench it and it's kind of hard to pick up wet rice with your chopsticks.

I've certainly ventured outside of my usual noodle soups, and they're just as good, but not memorable. They have a house special fried noodle that is humongous! It's definitely for two meals and is $10.

If you like Hong Kong style milk tea, you can order it here. Beware, HK style refers to it being pretty strong and bitter in taste, so this is for those who know what they're getting in. I'm personally not a big fan, so I only got it once or twice to try."}
{"text":"My husband an I moved here from the San Francisco Bay area 10 years ago.  We have been searching for good Chinese and finally found this place. The food is excellent. It's fresh and authentic. We will be eating here often!"}
{"text":"I admit that I love the food (although sometimes the MSG is a little heavy). I used to come here quite a lot. However, I haven't been back in a while because of the terrible service I received the last time I was in. It took almost 40 minutes for my credit cards to be processed. The front desk lady and I had an incredibly hard time communicating and it took forever to figure out how to split the bill for my group of friends. I understand that its complicated to split a bill for many people, but 40 minutes???!! That's a little too much. 

I'm hoping I can go back sometime soon to get some of their tomato, beef and egg, but definitely with only a friend or two. I can't imagine handling another 40 minute transaction time."}
{"text":"Really delicious food.  We ate here on the recommendation of some friends who are big fans, and they did not steer us wrong!  The portions are huge and the food came out quickly (although not all at the same time, but...whatever).  The service was decent, and the prices are beyond reasonable.  The sesame chicken was the best I've had anywhere.  Some places just don't get it right, but this place has it down.  This is definitely a place I'll go to again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. The food is very authentic and everything is always so good. We ordered chili chicken, deep fried sole, salt pork, salt squid, beef chow hofun, Szechwan beef, fried rice, orange chicken, and a veggie dish ever thin was better then the next."}
{"text":"Use the photos and you'll taste what you see. Use the  menus and prepare for confusion. Just use the photos!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Cantonese food!! We got the famous fish tofu casserole (worth its fame), roast pork wonton noodle soup (good noodles! Shrimp wontons not limp!), & fish stomach soup (soul warming). Served with a huge bowl of white rice. We can eat a lot but we still had leftovers.  

Prices are $1-2 more pricey than what I'm used to for Cantonese food. Who've thought Cleveland would be more expensive than New York City?? 

The wait staff was very nice to us, even warning us that we're ordering too much food for 2 people. They also have specialty drinks like bubble tea & Thai coffee. 

Only downside is the sketchy neighborhood but parking is right outside and there's closed circuit monitoring of the parking lot inside the restaurant. The insides of the restaurant is also much much nicer than it seems from outside."}
{"text":"Always hit this place when visiting from San Diego. Always enjoy the Salted Pork, Bitter Melon with Shrimp, Roasted Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Walnut Shrimp and Orange Chicken!!! Perfect place for kids...lots of noise!"}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area I am a bit of a Chinese food snob. Imagine my disappointment when I relocated to Cleveland and found it was a wasteland in terms of Chinese dining. (I guess it shouldn't have been much of a surprise.) Restaurant after restaurant I walked away yearning for the abundance of cheap, delicious and diverse Chinese food I left behind. One day, my wife suggested we visit Wonton Gourmet & BBQ, a nondescript restaurant in a Cleveland's modest Chinatown. (Not 100% sure if it's really a Chinatown, but there are a few Chinese businesses near by.)  Appearance aside, I went in with an open stomach and mind. I'm sure glad I didn't let the spartan interior dissuade me from giving it a try. In addition to friendly service (I think it's family run.), the food was really good. I'm not talking good for Cleveland, but good regardless of geographical location. Sure, the food can be greasy, but who goes to a Chinese restaurant to eat healthy? I just make sure I load up on veggies and fruit when I get back home.

Favorite menu item at the moment: Spicy beef soup noodle"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Food was excellent.  Had heard about the Beef Chow Fun and it lived up to it's reputation.  Server was a pleasure.  He was very friendly and pleasant.  Food portions are large.  Great value for the money."}
{"text":"Yum. Legit.
But I recommend NOT cabbing here. No one wants to pick you up and take you back down town! Cab companies seem to think its a bad part of town.
The food was good!
The house wontons are super good. 
Spicy beef noodle soup and the duck wonton noodle soup were also really good. 
If I weren't leaving tomorrow I'd be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the wall really cheered me up.  I'd eaten a particularly unsavory meal the night prior (which will be rated at a later date) which had led me to quite a funk about the state of chinese cuisine in CLE.

Fortunately, a couple dear friends brought be for a Saturday brunch here that included Chive dumplings (Guotie), Cantonese styled fried noodles iwth beef (Niurou caomian, Liangmianhuang), Peppered calamari (Cao youyu),  Beef tendon hot pot (niunan bao).  Cantonese breakfast food is available here, and the pricing is quite nice; though you can get cheaper in NYC (Due to really stiff competition).   The team here is essentially recently from HK; it's got the feel of HK street food, and the taste matches the ambiance.  Translation:  It's not haute couture for food... it's food for the people at prices the people can pay.  It's cooked and served with a fair amount of warmth, and served with the no-nonsense affection that some Hkers oft give off.

Oh...  They have cold milk tea!!!!

Why a four?   It's really a 4.5 due to price point... but I have to check out the other cantonese restaurants before scaling it for CLE."}
{"text":"If you feel adventurous and love spicy food, try their spicy pork intestines. It's actually very authentic. Also, their black bean with tripe are really good as well. These are 2 very different dishes from normal chinese dishes.
They were extremely busy on weekends around lunch, so try to go a little bit early or a bit later to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Love this place.

The customers are usually at least 2/3 Asian, which is always a good sign.  Everything I order is good.

Favorites:

* Black Pepper Short Ribs - So good.  Near-impossible to eat with silverware or chopsticks, for me at least
* Hong Kong Fried Chicken
* Chili Chicken
* Salted Bake Pork Chop"}
{"text":"I really love wonton gourmet! When a few friends & I \"discovered\" this little place, we just fell in love with it. There were even 3 older Chinese men smoking outside of the restaurant! \"You know that it's good when...\"

I usually go for the shrimp wontons with noodles because I'm craving the dish. Everything else is really tasty. They also have congee with thousand year old egg. 

Since then, wonton gourmet has seemed to grow in popularity. I went in for lunch a few times and it was packed! I only hope that they don't start to Americanize their food to appease customers.

My Chinese food-expert friends agree -- this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Good authentic food and polite service.  Come hungry.  Nice to have an authentic Chinese restaurant downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Without question the best Chinese food in Cleveland. Our offices have been in the \"asian district\" neighborhood for about 5 years, and we've tried them all. The Egg Rolls are beyond reproach. Seriously the best in the city. The \"wall menu\" (you'll see what I mean) has been pretty funny to watch evolve over the years."}
{"text":"It saddens me that Wonton Gourmet and BBQ is a mere fig newton of what it once was. For the first few years of their existence my husband and I along with numerous friends frequented the place almost weekly. A few years ago the place started on a steady decline and despite the promise offered by new ownership, has not made it's way back up.

Their Turnip Cakes used to be my gold standard for Turnip Cakes and they used to be great every time. Then they went through a phase of sometimes coming out of the kitchen undercooked and flaccid. To compensate we started asking for them to be \"crisp\" when we ordered them. That worked about half the time but the other half they came out burnt. On our last visit, not only were they burnt but they tasted sour and old.

Their Bitter Melon, Eggs and Shrimp used to be a favorite. After two orders with shrimp so ammoniated it was inedible, I started ordering it with out shrimp but the dish was wildly inconsistent. Sometimes the melon was undercooked and exceptionally bitter and other times it seemed so wet that it left the whole dish sitting in a small puddle of water. 

I'll not go on and on over other dishes that have disappointed but will say that the lack of cleanliness has also been a turn off and the constant blaring of the TV is something I can't take.

I wish we could have the old Wonton back."}
{"text":"I would like to take back my negative review of Wonton Gourmet from several months back. I've come to realize that although Wonton has so-so service, the food is hands down the BEST Cantonese food in all of Cleveland! The price is also fair! 

Make sure you order the braised beef or fish and the jade tofu!"}
{"text":"Wonton is a great place to go with a large group of people. When we come with around 10 people, we get around 7-8 dishes to share, and leave feeling super full and satisfied.

The owner (at least I guess he is) is also super friendly and likes to joke around with the customers. The waitresses are also attentive, and they even knew what we wanted before we had to ask (probably a sign we come here too often haha). Of course, it always helps when you do speak Chinese.

We tend to order the same few dishes with some changes. My personal favorite is the Jade Tofu with Fish. The egg tofu in it is so soft and simply melts in your mouth, and it has a good mix of veggies in it making it a good stand-alone dish. Another favorite is the salted pork chops, which are hot, crispy, and delicious. If you like spicy dishes, consider the Mapo Tofu or the Spicy Fish (not totally sure what the English version is called, but the ???). Or if you want more veggies, try the Tung Choy or the Pea Sprouts (this one is seasonal). If you want noodles, order the Beef Chow Fun (always a good one). Finally, on cold days, get the Watercress and Sliced Pork Soup--a clean and light taste, but yummy and warms your right up 

Those are a lot of options to choose from, but honestly it is hard to go wrong. Just take a look around the picture menus on the wall and get what looks good to you!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from here and got the spicy beef and noodle soup. The broth was complex and the noodles have a great texture. The beef was very tough though-a few of the pieces I had were inedible. I have to compare it to other places I have gotten beef tendon soups, they were melt in your mouth with just enough chew. I also got the fried potstickers. Again, delicious flavor. I will definitely come back and try a few other dishes though."}
{"text":"Stopped by while visiting from Michigan and saw this place had good reviews. First thing js I'm glad the restaurant had a parking lot as I was afraid we'd have to street park. 

Walking into the restaurant it seemed like this was THE place to go for authentic Chinese food as the place was packed and everybody seemed pretty \"fobby\". We got a table pretty quickly though.

I ordered the typical BBQ pork over rice, wife ordered #23 three flavored shrimp noodle, and we added a salty fish fried rice as well. BBQ pork over rice was only average, pork was a little too lean and the rice was dry and clumpy, the BBQ sauce was good tho. Wife's noodles were also only average but the dumplings had good flavor. I would say the salty fish fried rice was the best of the dishes and probably because it was the most authentic. 

Service was good and quick. 

If this were California I'd give it 3 stars, but for being in Ohio it deserves 4 stars. Good enough for the Midwest!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Stopped by before a show at csu. No one in our party of six realized that each entree feeds 3. We ordered six entrees two orders of pot stickers and soups. This was more food than thanksgiving. 
The waitress was kind enough to inform me that I was trying to order pork fat. I switched to the chili spicy fish. It was excellent. I rarely order cooked fish but I would definitely order this again. I got to try all the entrees. Two in our party order of the American style menu. Moo goo gai pan and Szechuan chicken. I wish the American style Chinese restaurants put out dishes as good as these.
Chive pot stickers were just plain great. 
Hong Kong style fried noodles were a stand out. Crunchy around the edges. 
Service was efficient and friendly. All of this food was $87 before tip. Crazy cheap for 6 people. We were eating leftovers for three days."}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is still my first choice for Chinese in Cleveland. They have THREE different menus. (I swear, there used to be just two.)

This place is always packed every time I stop in. And it's packed with real, live Chinese people. So, like Daniel A., said -- it must be good. 

I finally took the plunge for the deep fried pork intestine this time. It was okay. Not crispy enough for me. And perhaps too organ-y. (And I'm having tripe later this evening.) 

You MUST try the hot chili chicken dish. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  My husband and I have been here three times since the summer and we love it.  Every dish that we've had (we never ordered from the American menu) has been delicious, portions are huge and the prices inexpensive.  I was honestly a little intimidated the first time there.  My favorites are the house pot stickers (these are a MUST) and the szechuan fish, the fish is extremely spicy and not for the faint of heart.  We haven't been disappointed with one dish.  Next trip I am going to try the seafood hot pot.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  The best Chinese food in Cleveland.  Love the Hot and Spicy Szechuan Fish and House Pot Stickers.  Authentic (menu on the wall) and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I can't even explain to express this place. It's a small place but the food is fantastic and pretty cheap for the amount you get. We usually order 4-5 plates at a time for 3 and take mostly of it home because they give you so much."}
{"text":"Best chinese/hong kong style restaurant in town
A bit old but food is definitely good 
Hong kong lemon tea is great 
Wonton soup is good"}
{"text":"Came here with the two best friends on a Saturday night . Not busy at all . We ordered the beef brisket wonton and ramen, roast pork wonton and ramen and the duck ramen . The wontons were good but the broth was super SUPER bland - it tastes like boiling water with no flavoring . So so so disappointed . We also tried the mapo tofu which was good . Overall, large portion , but poor flavoring . I do not think we will be returning"}
{"text":"I went here a few more times after my last review and hate to say this but the food has gotten bad. First of all, don't take granted of their prices. They are marked on the menu as is but they'll tell you that it's actually higher and don't bother in changing the prices on the menu. Secondly, all of their foods are hella salty and has way too much MSG so if you're allergic and don't want to end up drinking tons of tea or water, ask without it. 

From the last visit which was this past Saturday, we tried their roast pork wonton soup and broth lacked authenticity. It tasted like definitely instant packet broth. This of course caused everything else in the dish as a failure. The lo mein noodles were literally just hard and lumped together. When I order my soup, I like it to be soupy hot and my noodles silky smooth. Then I can actually enjoy it. This was poorly incorporated. The vegetables, pork, noodles seemed separate from each other like they didn't belong together in the soup. I tried something different instead of ordering beef chow fun all the time so I tried the lo mein with beef brisket in HK style, price listed for $10.95 but waitress said its $12.95. horrible dish by the way. It was just stir fry lo mein noodles with Yu Choy and beef brisket. boring dish, which was really disappointing and overpriced!"}
{"text":"I had the duck soup and it was very good! My friends had the chicken lo mein and the sesame chicken which were also delicious! The only thing was that they had a couple different copies of the menus so that was confusing. They have photos of the dishes up on the walls, which was helpful but you can't see them all from your table, so I'd recommend them making up new menus with photos in them. This would make it a lot easier for people to know what they're ordering."}
{"text":"nothing special. microwaved food is better."}
{"text":"I'll definitely have to re-visit for dinner, based on Yelp reviews.  I had lunch there and definitely was not blown away.   I went on a recent Friday afternoon, not crowded, but not empty either.  I was seated right away.   There was a little bit of a wait before someone came by to take my order.   I ordered the lunch portion of Szechuan Shrimp, which came with Fried Rice and an egg roll.  While waiting for my order, I noticed that everyone around me, had pots of hot tea, I flagged down my waitress and asked for tea, she seemed a little bit bothered, but brought it shortly thereafter.   My order arrived, pretty large portion for lunch.  The fried rice, was just that, no veggies, just brown tinted rice.  The eggroll was just ok, nothing extraordinary and a little bit dry.  The eggroll was accompanied by some type of fruit sauce (pineapple maybe), that was also, just ok.   The entree, where do I start?   The Szechuan Shrimp was absolutely drenched in a huge amount of what looked (and tasted) like hoisin sauce with a few red pepper flakes for heat.   The selection of vegetables was just ok, kinda looked like a hodge podge of whatever was laying around in the kitchen.   I walked away from my lunch very disappointed.   There was a direct view of the area behind the register (also where the drink dispenser was located), I could see supplies, garbage etc.  Also there was a big pool of water in front of the register, as I was checking out.   Needless to say, I REALLY wanted to like this place but it really missed the mark for me.   I will give it a another try, in order to try some of the more authentic cuisine, such as the salt-baked selections.  Just not sure that I will return soon:-("}
{"text":"10 stars !!!  my favorite chinese restaurant in cleveland!  I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food (because I am Chinese and I know it when the food is authentic and good).  I visit this place at least once a week, no kidding.  The price is very reasonable, place is clean, and people is nice.  I have been living in Cleveland for almost 4 years, and I found this place about 2 years ago (WTH wrong with me?).  Once in a while I still visit Siam (another Chinese restaurant) but I can say that none of the Chinese restaurants around town can compare to this one.  You can get a wide range of Chinese food from this place.  (HK style, northern chinese style, etc)  MUST TRY their mike tea - hot or cold - you can't get more \"HongKong\" style than what they have.    

On top of the wonderful food, the most important thing is their owner.  I know him personally, and he really cares about the quality of food they serve and tries to keep his customers happy.  Let me just say this, Wonton Gourmet will be one of the few things I will miss about Cleveland when I move! =)"}
{"text":"SF Bay Area native here, home of the most delicious and culturally diverse foods! I'm very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine, specifically Chinese food, Japanese food, and Vietnamese food. One trend that I am aware of (and dislike) is that many Asian restaurants dilute the quality of the \"authentic\" Asian cuisine, often \"Americanizing\" it for the American palate. 

With that being said, this is my fourth Chinese restaurant in the Northeastern Cleveland area, and this by far tops them all. It's a small hole in the wall type of joint, mom & pop shop owned, but they have a big parking lot that is under video camera surveillance. 

They serve your typical Americanized Chinese dishes (orange chicken, General Tsao chicken, etc.), but they also serve authentic Chinese dishes. Been here three times already, and each time I order the Jade Tofu dish, hands down THE BEST tofu dish I have ever eaten! I'm not usually a tofu-dish type of person, but they use an egg-tofu in the dish which gives you a silkier, melt-in-your-mouth tofu taste that is absolutely out of this world delicious! It is typically served with bite size pieces of fried fish, but you can ask them to skip the frying and soft-cook the fish instead.

This is my top pick for Chinese restaurants in the Northeastern Ohio area.

Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else."}
{"text":"Looking for a go-to Chinese joint when you get that craving? Look no further. There's literally no reason to go anywhere else in the area. This place is as authentic as it gets with lots of delicious options to satisfy any Chinese food craving. Nothing here tastes over salted, over cooked/ crunchy or over sauced-- which are all huge NO NOs when it comes to Asian cuisine, at least in my book. 

The service is always super nice. They have their own parking lot and heck, you can even keep an eye on your car from the parking lot with the way their security cameras are set up and on monitors inside the restaurant. Small but accommodating, simple and clean. 

There are pictures of  entrees on the wall that may look a little silly but actually make a ton of sense and are super helpful if you need help choosing between their yummy options."}
{"text":"In Cleveland by far one of the best Chinese places that I have been to. The teas are real no tea bags, food is authentic and delicious. Wait staff very friendly unlike you get in most places like this. Hole in the wall no ambience but great food. Don't miss it"}
{"text":"I grew up in China, and this place offers the closest experiences to what you would get in China. Although it is located in the rundown Asian town and has lower than average decor and ambience, it offers the best Chinese food. The only places I got equivalent or slightly better Chinese food were at New York and San Francisco, so for Cleveland, this restaurant is good as Chinese food can get! You can tell how good it is by the people who go there - Chinese family and a lot of young people who like good food at a reasonable price! 2 thumbs up to this great place !"}
{"text":"This place is located in one of the sketchier parts of town but don't be deterred. This is seriously the best Chinese food I have ever had anywhere...hands down. Especially the three flavor shrimp wonton soup! Until I came here I had no idea Chinese food could taste SOOOO DAMN GOOD! I am contemplating placing a carry out order as I write this review They have 3 menus.. yes THREE! Which can be a tad bit confusing. If you dine in they have pictures which can help with your menu selection. I have not ventured much into the Hong Kong version of the menu but they have something for all taste levels. The service is just ehh but the food is so good who cares."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for dinner now and absolutely love this place. The food is delicious; I've tried the hot chili chicken, the schezwan eggplant, the scallion pancakes, and the shrimp pot stickers and would recommend any and all of these. This place has a typical, quick-serve chinese restaurant atmosphere, but the dishes are far better than your average chinese place. The price point is fairly inexpensive for the portion sizes that are served. A hidden treasure."}
{"text":"I'm glad I followed fellow Yelper's advise on this one. I would have probably never gone here otherwise.

A little hidden gem in china town. The dining room is tiny and it's filled with real asians and stuff!  ;)  Seriously though, it's always a good sign when people of the given ethnicity are dining at an ethnic restaurant.

For an appetizer, we enjoyed Crispy Fried Pork Intestine and Potstickers. The pork intestine was excellent. Not the healthiest of things to eat with the yummy layer of fat, but sometimes you just have to indulge. The potstickers were good, although I would have liked them to be a bit more browned in the pan. They seemed almost steamed, not pan fried. For the entree, I ordered the Fried Porkchop. Excellent with delicately sweet sauce, but beware of the small bones!

It's beneficial that they have photos on the wall of all of the offerings. It helps for those of us that don't speak the language. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"this place is delicious. one of the first chinese places i went to when i first moved here, and still one of like two places i go for real chinese food. this is as authentic as it gets.
i always get my staples... house tofu, house eggplant with garlic sauce, and vegetable tofu panfried noodles. delicious.
i've also had their ramen at one point, and some other appetizers. everything is great. it's definitely oily, appropriately so for good chinese food, so don't come here expecting super healthy and go bitching about it! the vegetables are fresh tho, no question. and i'm sure there is plenty of msg in everything. msg is amazing. yes, it is the same thing as umami you crazy people!
another plus is the pictures on the wall. you get to know what you're getting into!"}
{"text":"So, this is my primary restaurant. lets talk. Lets get price out of the way. Most of the time , I get out of here for two people between $15 and $20. And I'm stuffed and taking food home. My favorite dish listed below is $12.95  This is Chinese fare as good as anywhere. Real Chinese food. Real Chinese people.  5 star is based on food and price, and service only. Its exceptional. The people who own this place are hard working honest , exceptional chefs. And the table staff are hard working too.
      The layout is to  cater to Asian  family  groups in the middle. On large round tables.  And the tables have glass topped lazy Susans. Everyone orders  a plate then they share via the lazy Susan. This is how Asians eat. The walls are where four seat tables are at.    The great thing, is they put color full page pictures on all  the walls of almost all their dishes. So you can walk around and look if you dont know what the heck you want. 
      Saying that. its old and divey. And probably paid for,  which explains the super low prices. It is packed most of the time. All the Chinese come here. Theres a lot of CSU students too. City  office workers.  I have never been disappointed with anything that I ordered here. The shrimp wonton soup, the spicy wonton, and salted baked pork chop are the must. The food price is low and the food portion is big, And they have take home boxes. And they pack it up for you. 
          The service is another thing that I am always impressed when eating at this restaurant. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive. Again, please don't expect anything fancy here. When I say the service is great, it is great when comparing with many Chinese restaurants where the waiters/waitresses often cannot even speak English and very short with customers. Here, the staffs always smile and are nice. And, importantly, all staffs, as I experienced so far, can speak English. 
They actually have about three menus. So they do Hong Kong food and Chinese / Chinese American food. But I order off the walls usually. 

My favorite dish here is called Pork Chops Hong Kong Style. Its really like an American oven cooked casserole .Not Chinese food .  The wall picture does not do this dish justice. They double cooked  breaded pork chops and bake them in an oven over rice an hour. And its topped with a oven cooked  tomato based vegetable  topping . You have to wait 45 minutes for this dish So I don't get it if Im in a hurry.  . But its really like American food. The rest of the menu is faster to get. And Chinese. 

They got tv cameras so you can watch your vehicles from some of the seats. They got their own parking lot is big. Its west of Dave's Supermarket on the North side of Payne. . Big Yellow canopy.  The neighborhood looks dicey but I never had any issues for many years. its generally 75 percent full. All local Asians eat here. They got big group tables with  glass topped lazy susans. too. Asian language TV is on all the time ."}
{"text":"My 5-star rating for this place is totally based on its food and service. I disregarded the atmosphere of the restaurant as I always come here mainly for food, not for a romantic dinner for sure. The restaurant is located in the area where I often feel unsafe, but the food is so good that I always have to come back. 

It almost sounds exaggerating, but true, to say that everything I ordered here is so tasty and flavorful. I have never been disappointed with anything that I ordered here. The shrimp wonton soup, the spicy wonton, and salted baked pork chop are the must. The food price and the food portion are also very reasonable.

The service is another thing that I am always impressed when eating at this restaurant. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive. Again, please don't expect anything fancy here. When I say the service is great, it is great when comparing with many Chinese restaurants where the waiters/waitresses often cannot even speak English and very short with customers. Here, the staffs always smile and are nice. And, importantly, all staffs, as I experienced so far, can speak English. 

Overall, if you are in the mood for \"great\" Chinese food while you are in downtown Cleveland and looking for a very casual meal, this is the to-go place that you should visit. It is true that the atmosphere at Liwah (another Chinese restaurant close by) is better than this place, but the food, price, and service are not comparable to this place."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. Very authentic! By far the best dry chili chicken we have ever had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. Everything else was flavorful as well. The only downside would be slow inconsistent service. But it's not terrible. Will be back again some time."}
{"text":"Ordered wonton noodle soup with the three different types of dumplings. Meh...not bad, not amazing. I guess something in between. We tried some other dishes: taro, fried dumplings, duck wonton soup which were all just okay. This place was pretty bumpin on a Saturday, we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong things because it certainly had an authentic feel. I'm tempted to go back and try it again before give this a completely mediocre review."}
{"text":"I married into a Chinese family. I know when shit is real, homemade, no fucking around, delicious food and when it's typical MSG-ridden American-Chinese. 

This place is ALMOST as good as my late husband's cooking and my MIL. The noodles are fresh, so please opt for the udon if you love homemade, chewy, fresh noodles. 

My best friend and I decided to go here after our first choice restaurant looked like something straight out of a horror movie. I am so glad we came here. PLEASE, do not let the looks discourage you from coming in this place. 

This is old school, hella dope Chinese food. 

My friend and I have been pretty depressed and stressed lately so we decided today was the day to embark on a binge of \"let's eat our feelings.\" We got a potsticker appetizer, she got the shrimp dumpling udon, and I got the beef udon soup & a bubble tea. PHENOMENAL. PHENOMENAL, guys. I fucked up that big ass bowl of garlicky udon like no ones business. That shit was the most flavorful and deep udon I have ever been served in a restaurant. The baby bok was tender but had enough snap for texture and it was so fresh. The broth had so many different flavor elements. But the real star was the udon. Seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Growing up on the east side of Cleveland, we frequently would head over to the restaurant in which was before Wonton Gourmet came around. Despite the limited tables and seats, the support system of Wonton Gourmet's customers is bigger than one can image! My family and I came downtown on a Saturday evening and the amount of people dining in and ordering takeout, during our dinner there was quite surprising. 

One of my favorite dishes as a kid and even as an adult is the Bejing Pork Chop. The sweet and savory red sauce of the pork chop pairs so well over white rice. In good ol' Chinese fashion, this family style restaurant allows you to share all the delicious goodness. With four adults, we ordered a soup and 3 main dishes to share. Needless to say, it was the perfect amount of food, without having to bring leftovers home! Highly recommend Wonton Gourment for authentic Chinese food and great service!"}
{"text":"Until recently, it's been a couple years since I've dined here. The food quality seem to have degraded after new ownership a few years ago, but now, it has redeemed itself! 

I dined here twice in one week because it was just that good! The last two dinners were excellent. In the two trips, I had the cold spicy beef tendons, beef tripe, salted fish fried rice, fish filet w/ jade tofu, and several of its noodle dishes. The quality and taste is now what I've remembered. We really liked the salted fish fried rice. Great flavors from the salted fish and is very light on soy since the fish is enough to season the rice. The other dishes were also very tasty. The cold cut tendons were a great appetizer during and prior to the meal.

Definitely worth a visit if you are into authentic Chinese. Be sure to use the pictures on the wall to help you decide!"}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is a gem in Cleveland.  Granted it isn't located in the best area, but don't let it's location fool you.  Some of the best eats are located in shady places.  

Their portions are huge and everything is priced right.  Think family-style dining.  They have a more authentic menu for those of us wanting AUTHENTIC Chinese food and they also have an Americanized menu for those with more western palettes.  They have pictures of their dishes along the walls of the restaurants.  

The restaurant is small and can get crowded, but it's always a good sign to see a Chinese restaurant packed full of Chinese people...and gwai lo!  The restaurant itself is super clean, service is friendly and they do speak English, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Ok place for a lunch stop.   The place is basic, dated, and not fancy, but you do get a decent value.  We had pork ribs with bittermelon and a bowl of their wonton noodle soup."}
{"text":"The boy and I spent 3 days in Cleveland for a business trip, and every night we would stop by here to get take out to bring back to our hotel room.  Close to authentic Cantonese style food; we thoroughly enjoyed every dish we had but the Jade Tofu with Fish Fillet stands out the most.  Their Hong Kong style milk tea and lemon tea are definitely worth trying too.  

I really love how generous they are with their portions, this restaurant really has amazing value for how much food they give you.  Most Cantonese restaurants I have been to usually offer subpar service, but not this place.  Their staff are very friendly and attentive.  

The outside of the restaurant might not look like much, but if you're craving for some good Chinese food, Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is worth trying.  

Ambiance: 5/10; Service: 9/10; Food: 8/10"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!!! Seriously authentic Chinese food. Salted bake calamari= delicious, tung Chou with garlic- yum, beef brisket lo mein Hong Kong style was amazing, and loved the home style bean curd (just a tad spicy for kids but very mild for adults)
sautéed pork over ho fun was a bit bland, but the kids loved it and the noodle texture was good.
Potstickers- so flavorful with great texture, So much more I wanted to try, but portions are huge!"}
{"text":"A few days ago I took my niece who is visiting from out of town for lunch at Wonton. She studied in China and remarked how much better the food was at Wonton. Since she traveled to several locations in China I accept her comment as having merit. I read reviews from New Yorkers whining that only NYC can make pizza. Californians snidely remark only they have good sushi or real Korean food. 

New Yorkers are too provincial to realize only they like flat foldable pizza. Californians fail to acknowledge that Japan buys its fish from Hawaii and Korean food served in LA is called California Korean. What does all this mean? There just is no authentic food. Each cook adds her own flair. As families gain more wealth they forgo the previous \"authentic\" cheap cuts for those more prime. Living in different regions means taking advantage of the local ingredients. Everyone in America makes chili. Whose can be called the authentic American chili? 

Is Wonton authentic Chinese? For the cooks there it is and that is good enuff for me. Some things I have had there are the best of class, e.g., the pot stickers. Some things are far from the best. The char siu pork wonton noodle soup looks beautiful with a generous slab of red char siu. However the five spice powder used on the pork is so cloying I can taste nothing else. 

Not everything will be to everyone's taste, but with thought any diner wishing a good Chinese dinner will find it here. May not be the first thing you order, but blame your ordering and not the food for any dissatisfaction. Remember you are not Chinese living in China, which my niece made clear has food not as good as Wonton."}
{"text":"Vincent and I were looking for some wonton soup place. It is really high-cost performance. If you are looking for Hong Kong style restaurant in Cleveland, here it is."}
{"text":"Still so gooodddd!!!!!! Man, I love this place. This place serves up wonderful Cantonese comfort food, but on our most recent visit, we tried the Sichuan-style braised eggplant. Oh so good, even without the ridiculous spice. I'm sure that with the traditional spice level, this place would have been off the charts! However, we were with our friend who is not a fan of spice, so we went without. Next time though, I will have to try it in all its spice glory! A bit on the oily/greasy side, but I've seen worse.

Beef chow fun, dumpling soup, and fish fillet tofu stir-fry are still top notch, and worth every penny. Eating family style is the way to go here, so you can try as many flavor profiles and take some home with you!

Lunch rush seems to be between the 11-12:30pm hour on the weekends, so to avoid that, come around 1:30pm and you will have no wait. Regardless, I'll be happy to wait to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is everything others have said so I'll skip all that so you can read something new. 

The front lady was SUPER nice and helpful. They literally ask you to walk around the room and look at the pictures of food on the wall and pick what you want. (I was ordering to-go.) I'm a bigger fan of Manderin & Szechwan than Cantonese, but since this place is touted as the best Chinese in Cleve, I am there. 

I ordered: 
*Pork Pot Stickers w/ Green Onion = authentic and delightful
*Dandilion leaves sauteed = this is a lot like chinese broccoli or spinach and it doesn't disappoint
*Hot & Spicy Pork Noodle Soup= pretty good, but I had wanted Hot & Sour, they don't have it, so this is what I got. 
*Chicken Chow HoFun= very good, but dare i say it could have used more salt? 

I give this place 4 stars for being super authentic, VERY reasonable, GINORMOUS portions and for being incredibly kind to a blonde tourist walking in because of Yelp. 

My ONLY disappointment was the chinese donut. I asked the gal if i should get congee OR the donut, and she said you should get both. This seemed weird to me, why do I need two desserts? But now I get why, you have to coat the donut in something otherwise its just a naked churro with zero flavor. I wish she had just told me to get both, I would have seeing as I'm relying on her. 

On the whole, I am SO glad I went there as opposed to some americanized P.O.S. (piece of shit) strip mall joint. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally I was able to check out this place since moving to Cleveland from California for 1 month...I had a shrimp wonton watercress with noodle and my bro had duck wonton noodle. We also ordered a young chow (house special) fried rice and shrimp rice roll. I would say the noodle itself is not that special and the soup base is just typical. However I liked the wonton that my bro had better because it had a sesame flavor in there (just my opinion). My wonton mixed with watercress was alright. The fried rice was good but not great....good because it's not oily although they used spam in there...not too authentic...it should be chinese sausage instead....The shrimp rice roll had a nice medium soft texture and freshly made...It was great....The overall experience there was actually awesome, speaking of a Chinese restaurant in Cleveland...I'd definitely come back soon this weekend to check out their other dishes....BTW, their prices are not bad at all as well as their services."}
{"text":"Good authentic Chinese.  Spicy wonton appetizer was excellent.  Was too full to try the rice roll donut but I'll be going back for it soon.  Very basic dining room but comfortable.  Service was polite and prompt.  I highly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't recall ordering anything here that wasn't outrageously delicious.  Plus the portions are enormous (lunch the next day.)  I also asked some Chinese co-workers, \"What's the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland?\" -- all three answered \"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ\" without hesitation."}
{"text":"I certainly enjoyed the food here.  Great atmosphere and some of the best cumin lamb I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hungry?  For authentic Chinese food that tastes great, Wonton Gourmet & BBQ should definitely be on the short list of places to go.  Given its name, the Hong Kong style Wonton & noodle soups are a must-try.  They have shrimp wontons and there is also a three-variety dumpling version.  These are NOT the tasteless Americanized wontons that are made with thick doughy wrappers with hardly any meat - these are very tasty flavorful thin skinned wontons.  

I also really like their beef haw fun (wide noodles), salt baked seafood, and fish fillets and tofu.  Their XO seafood friend rice is also very tasty.  There's plenty of other good dishes to try also.  This is not a fancy place and is low in terms of decor or ambiance.  But as can be judged by the many Asians that frequent the restaurant, the focus is on authentic good Chinese food.

Oh, and don't be intimidated if you don't know Chinese and are not familiar with the cuisine.  They make it very easy as the walls are plastered with photos of all the dishes with an order number, the Chinese name, and the American name.  If your mouth is full and you want to order more, you can just point at the photos if you have to.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best, most authentic Chinese restaurants near downtown Cleveland. My family and I frequent this place to dine in, order take-out--consistently solid."}
{"text":"Stars: 3+

Pros: 

First, there are not many Chinese restaurants in the area to choose from. Cleveland's \"chinatown\" is rather non-existent. Wonton gourmet is exactly what you'd expect a good chinese restaurant to be like in Cleveland.

Important note: the style is Cantonese/Hong Kong cuisine.

A few memorable dishes: 

A very famous spicy beef dish (), fortunately comes in a spicy oil-based sauce. Believe it or not, some Taiwanese restaurants serve this Szechuan dish in WATER (Peach farm in Chinatown of Boston). The beef could be much more tender, and the vegetables (generally napa cabbage) was not cut very thinly. It was just chunks of the thick bottom part of the vegetable, not even the leaves. Somewhat disappointing. 

\"Aromatic\" Eggplant (). Pretty good. Note: this style of cooking MUST be done in a lot of oil. Therefore, it is oily, no surprise there. Tastes decent. Eggplant not overly done, and cooked on high heat. Retains the purple color, very nice. Chicken is very tender. The sauce is my only gripe, as it could be more flavorful.

I have heard that the #6 dish: Hong Kong fried rice on pork chops?, is very good. I had it once and did enjoy it very much. Unfortunately, it was a while ago, so I can't remember.

The inside of the restaurant has pictures on the walls. Good concept.


Cons:
 
Some dishes, I believe, do have quite a bit of MSG. Of course glutamate makes any food taste much better (cuz it stimulates umami taste sensation), but it makes me want to throw up sometimes if it is used too heavily. Was not exactly pleasant.

 
Overall, your standard Chinese restaurant. Can't go wrong, but you can go better (to Cali or NJ, haha)."}
{"text":"This place is crazy authentic--like, waitresses don't speak english, fried pork intestines and pictures of the menu on the walls authentic. 

Like many other yelpers have mentioned, the service is very transactional, but not necessarily rude. The restaurant itself is a clean hole-in-the-wall, if that makes sense. I noticed there wasn't any carpet (thank god) and everything appeared pretty spotless. 

Then, for the most indecisive person in the world, the moment of doom: three menus (count 'em) chock-full of delicious/strange sounding noms. I just about had a panic attack trying to pic something when I remember fellow yelpers saying it's best to just order off the wall. Perfect! 

Our table of three way over ordered, but it was wonderful to be able to try a little bit of a lot of stuff! I ordered the roast pork wonton soup with noodles and the hot and spicy beef. The rest of the table ordered the garlic greens (name?), house potstickers, turnip cakes, roast duck wonton soup, fried pig intestines, and HK-style fried chicken. Let me start off by saying I did not have the balls to try the intestines, but my companions said it was crunchy, almost like a pork rind. I'll just have to take their word for it. 

The hot and spicy beef, garlic greens and pot stickers were my favorites. The beef was super tender and the sauce, although spicy, wasn't overly so. The greens were perfectly cooked and seasoned and the potstickers were crispy on the bottoms--yum! I tasted a little fishiness to the turnip cakes, so that turned me off and I didn't really try anything else. 

The bill was super small for all the food we consumed--eer boxed up, rather. But it was definitely a great first experience to truly authentic Hong Kong style Chinese food.  I'd definitely come back to try more off their three friggin menus!"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Chinese food I've had (and I'm Chinese). The dishes are full of flavor and well cooked. A Cleveland favorite."}
{"text":"I can only review my take out experience. I heard of this place from a friend who had raving reviews for Wonton Gourmet. Ordered the salt fried calamari, wonton soup, egg drop soup, General Tso's chicken and Orange Beef combo. We ordered through Ubereats (which is amazing!) and our food got here in about 20 minutes. We were very surprised at how much food we actually got. Portions are excellent and bigger than the usual combo boxes you get at a take out Chinese restaurant. The calamari was just a little bit soggy but that's to be expected for take out. Everything tasted delicious and not too greasy. Prices were very reasonable. 
Will DEFINITELY stop in and try a sit down meal!"}
{"text":"This place blew me away!! I didn't know you could get Chinese food like this in America--except maybe New York or San Francisco. Least of all Cleveland. They have all the different items posted on the wall and you walk around the restaurant (all Chinese people) and pick out what you want. Everythings homemade and in case some of the weirder stuff doesn't appeal to you, there is a more traditional \"gringo\" menu as well. All together, we spent less then 20$. No alchohol but there is a liquor store next door. It's right off the highway (we were just passing through and found it easily-a great roadtrip stop!!) and it's open till midnight. Nice people too"}
{"text":"The food is real. Some people are put off by the Chinese aspects of the place in that it looks, smells, and is an actual Chinese restaurants. It is a small place that is not fancy and isn't in the best location,  but who really cares with good food. The place is very clean with pictures of most of the food on the walls.  If you are looking for authentic  Chinese noodle soup you will be hard pressed to find better in the Cleveland area. They have several menus. They have the Hong Kong Style menu, the authentic Chinese mostly Cantonese menu and the Americanized Chinese style menu. I personally go for the Wonton with Noodle Soups or the hard to find Congee on the Hong Kong style menu. With 14 verities of Noodle soup, it  makes it hard for me to decide, Roasted Duck, Pork or Beef Brisket. The Wontons them self are light and delicious, with a good Shrimp flavor to them. The soup broth is delicate letting the meat and Wonton shine. So for those wanting eat more closely to like what you would get in China give it a try"}
{"text":"Great little joint; pipes in satellite TV - what a treat to watch Asian variety shows while having a late Saturday-night  dinner.  It's the kind of place where you can order off the Chinese menu, except that the Chinese menu is accessible to everyone.

Good:
* Great, great food.  The seafood with X and O sauce, the salty fried rice, the jade tofu with fish - I order these with regularity.
* The wait staff are super-nice and happy to make recommendations.
* Good price for decent food.

Bad: 
* I love snow pea shoots, and all other manner of greens, and order them here, but they are on the greasy side."}
{"text":"A great place as far as I can tell so far.  Serves authentic Chinese food and never heard of anyone getting sick from eating here."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food here.  I've moved out to Ohio recently for school, and being from SoCal where Asian food is abundant, it is SO SO hard to find good Asian food out here.  This place is definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"The wonton noodle soup w pork was awesome! Outside of Pho, this soup broth is the best I've had flavor wise. The fullness of the broth was excellent, and I don't usually sit around talking about soup broths. The pork in the soup tasted really good, as well. Additionally, I ordered the Jasmine Tofu w pork. This was the first time I've actually ordered tofu as my entree at a restaurant, and wow was it good. Melt in your mouth good! So fresh! Service was excellent, as well, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Totally love Wonton Gourmet. Absolutely friendly staff and incredible food. I'm partial to the cumin lamb but everything I've ever had has been fantastic. Really affordable and huge portions. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My son and I love this little spot.  The pot stickers, sesame chicken and spicy pork ramen are our go to's.  Also good is the hot and spicy beef, spring rolls and fried rice.  This little place is clean and the staff speak enough English to be helpful...and they're very nice!  

Tables are always filled with neighborhood Asian folks...so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Hunan East. You used to be my #1 but Wonton Gourmet just beat you. You want authentic food with reasonable price and quantity? Welcome to wonton gourmet!! 

I came here 3x within the last 2 weeks and I'm still craving it! The few dishes you must try: Chicken with Eggplant (forgot sauce name), Beef Ho Fun, & Tofu Seafood Pot (I think that's what it's called).

Let's start with Beef Ho Fun. Usually when I go to a Chinese restaurant for the first time, i already order beef ho fun. It's the easiest way to tell how good/bad a restaurant will be. And wonton gourmet, THANK GOD I FOUND YOU. I love it! i love it! this place is just delicious!!! Then, there's this chicken with eggplant dish that my friend insisted we ordered. The sauce didn't sound that exciting and I don't like to eat eggplant, but the sauce will make me order this dish forever again. Last, the tofu with seafood pot.... the tofu is my favorite kind of tofu in the world! And I finally found a place that cooks it.

Wonton Gourmet, thank you for existing in Cleveland. I will forever make sure you stay open and successful."}
{"text":"This place is pretty F*cking good. All of the flavor and none of the glitz as some other places in China Town Cleveland. The pictures on the wall make it easy to try something authentic instead of some Moo-Go-Gi-Pan crap. The dumpling soups are the cure for what ever ails you. The service is great. I need to come here more often. With Hunan East around the corner its hard to justify the drive. When I order Chinese food from some place that is half way authentic I always ask for light on the oil. If you know how some of that stuff is cooked you would too. They did honor my request, thus no problems later in the evening. Oh did I mention that the prices are very reasonable? I ordered some Ho-fun noodles and they packaged the noodles and the sauce in different containers so they would not get soggy. That was most considerate. It took me 3 days to finish it. 5 stars and an F-Bomb. Almost put another F-Bomb in here but did not want to be a potty mouth."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went for the first time today and everyone loved their meals. I had the shrimp dumpling soup with noodles and split the salt baked whole shrimp. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Wonton gourmet is a frequent stop for me and my buddies (pretty much a small swarm of American-born Chinese students).  The food is cheap and tasty, and you can never go wrong with pointing at one of the many pictures along the walls and deciding you want to eat that dish.  Admittedly, the food is a bit on the oiler side, but it is quite good for the price.  It's hard to name which dishes would be our favorites, although often we will get a mixture of some of the following:  the salt and pepper pork/seafood/shrimp, the eggplant dishes, various seafood dishes, and mapo dofu.  The congee is also tasty whenever you're in the mood for it.  Overall, it's a good place to get cheap authentic Chinese food in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Good authentic Chinese restaurant.  It's a very casual place in a transitional area.  But they have dishes you don't find in most \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurants.  The cumin lamb was delicious and I really enjoyed chicken chow fun with pepper sauce."}
{"text":"I love the handmade noodles in their hot and spicy beef noodle soup. The broth is delicious too, albeit a bit salty, don't really mind it though I still love it. The beef brisket was a bit tough but the handmade noodles and broth made up for it!

Service is a bit slow, can be better. I'll definitely keep coming back for the beef noodle soup though :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Congee is delish and the food is extremely good, tasty and full of flavor. My only complaint, I wish they were open 24/7 lol, otherwise its awesome! You want authentic and good Chinese, go here!"}
{"text":"After many years of debate, I think I have to say that Wonton is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. I have never gotten a bad dish here! Two of my favorites (and my friends' favorites) are: jade tofu and eggplant with pork. Portions are generous and service is fast."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Wonton Gourmet & BBQ, and I was happy to find some decent Hong Kong food  in the area.  I'm Cantonese and I was surprised that my waiter started speaking Cantonese right away to me instead of starting with English, I would suggest going with a native or there might be some words lost in translation.  I was also surprised by the amount of menus?  3 menus, which my boyfriend found to be a bit overwhelming.  I think that wasn't the best idea, especially for people who have not been here for.  I would suggest ordering off the walls because they say everything there is good to eat.

 My boyfriend ended up got the shredded pork with fried noodles and it was  o.  I feel like there was a bit too much sauce on the dish, so the noodles became soggy pretty quickly but the portion was huge for the price.  The taste was alright but could have used some more seasoning.  I probably wouldn't get this again the next time

I got the beef brisket hong kong style noodles and it was the better of the two.  The broth was not to salty and the noodles came out pretty good.  There was an ample portion of beef brisket in the dish so that made me happy.  I would go again and maybe try some different things.  Overall I would say a 3.5, hopefully next time when I update this review it will go up to a 4!"}
{"text":"If this is the best Chinese food in Cleveland, then that sucks for Cleveland.  I found it greasy and not very flavorful.  The portions are big for the price, and that might make some people happy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is about 1/2 mile from downtown and they are opened everyday at 11am except on Tuesdays - closed on Tuesdays.  I'll have to give them 3.5 stars for now... I wasn't blown away by the establishment... two things going for them, the price and late hours.

I got there as they opened, got seated and reviewed the menu... they do have lot of pictures on the wall, but I decided to stick with the menu and check out what they had... yes, they do have two menus - one is for Americanized Chinese food and the other is for more authenticate food from the mainland.

I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with egg noodle and eggplant with shredded pork over rice.  Now, I had no idea what over rice meant, granted I did find out when the food arrived... but as a first timer, I was clueless... basically, the dish is served on a one plate, 1/2 is the rice, the other 1/2 is the dish, of which some are over the rice - hence, 'over the rice' menu dishes!

I got my eggplant first and it was good, I added the hot chili oil and it gave the extra kick to the dish... the shrimp wonton soup with egg noodle... well, it was very blend, so I had to add more salt and black pepper to give it a taste... but nonetheless, on a rainy day, it was very nice to have a warm noodle soup!  So for both dishes, my total price with tax was like $12.50, very cheap and their price is very reasonable!

As for the service, it was quick, but when I was there, there was only one waitress... and even though she knew I didn't speak Chinese, she kept it up :)  also, along with English... not sure why.... 

I would recommend you give this place a try and judge it for yourself... they are opened until midnight, so if you are craving for some Chinese food, swing on by for a byte!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some good Chinese grub, look no further. We got takeout - the crab Rangoon, egg drop soup, Szechwan beef, roasted pork fried rice and an egg roll. All delicious!!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the food was excellent! My mom and I had the Beef Chow Fun, Twice Cooked Pork & Malaysian style Tung Choy. All had a great distinctive aroma. Possibly the BEST authentic Chinese food in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Great place. I brought my younger sister and we scanned the walls for 10 minutes looking for the right dishes (they post large photos of all dishes). Delicious experience! Their soups are quite notable, but you can't go wrong with anything that looks tasty on the walls. We got eggplant and frog legs!"}
{"text":"Bam I'm in China.  I was just in Cleveland like 3 steps ago.  I actually cannot comment on the food authenticity, but I can tell you it was good.  The best pot stickers I have ever had.  The thing that makes this place worth a trip is the variety.  I am so tired of going to a Thai place or Chinese place and having the same menu items as the Asian food at some grocery stores.  Wonton has different selections, and don't worry about not know what you are getting.  Just point to the picture of it on the wall, and it will be swiftly brought out.

The only bad part is the cramp dining setup.  Enjoy Asian food with the joys of over population.  

I would say Wontons is a must at least once."}
{"text":"Looking from the outside, you may just pass it up.  However inside is neat and clean and the food is some of the best I have ever had in CLE.  I will certainly order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch via Grubhub. Arrived ridiculously quick and stayed hot since it was way earlier than quoted. I had the Szechuan tofu and it was very good! Took a star off as there was only 4 pieces of scallion pancake, most places serve much more. 
I'll order again but skip the scallion pancake."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, a place with more Chinese than English in the menu, and the walls papered in pictures of delicious foods. No frills, casual, but extremely tasty authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm beyond sad to write this review. This used to be my go-to place to introduce friends to Cantonese food for 5+ years. Salt bake pork chop was my favorite, along with Spicy shrimp, wood ear mushroom and melon, shrimps and bitter melon; and the earnest and chatty owner and his staff.

That is until the change of ownership about 2-3 years ago. 

After the new owner took over, I come back to check in every once in a while to see if things turned around. No, the food has never recovered to its previous glory.

Take spicy fried shrimps for example. There is too much breading. The shrimps were 3 times bigger in the previous version, and the breading was very light. You want to taste the shrimps, not the breading.

Salt bake pork chop - all you taste is the fry breading. Where's the pork?

If you've never been here under the previous owner, I suppose you don't know what you are missing. It's like a Tribute Band to a rock star who passed away - they can imitate, but they are not as good as the original."}
{"text":"Wonton gourmet has always been one of my favorite restaurants. I was very excited to find out that they are part of skip the dishes delivery on line.

Portions are huge and absolutely delicious. My favorite items include the Ramen noodle dishes, wonton noodle dishes, Jade tofu and fish fillet.  If you like dumplings, try the pork or pork and chive dumplings. They are simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I have the most authentic wonton noodle in North America in this place. It tastes just like what I had back home. The beef is soft and the soup has sea food taste (which I like).
-------
folks, I came again recently. The congee is good but not the bubble tea....Besides, don't order shimp rice noodle roll. It is not FRESH!!! Smell funky too"}
{"text":"First rule of a good Chinese restaurant: 
There must be chinese customers.
Second Rule of a good chinese restaurant:
The chinese in the restaurant must be eating (not just waiting on tables) and speaking in languages you (presumably average Americans) don't understand.
Third Rule of a good Chinese restaurant:
No fortune cookies!

Thus I arrive at Wonton Gourmet and BBQ with my usual dose of skepticism. Though there were no Roast Duck or Char Siew hanging near the window, I was instantly transported to my happy place when I walked in.

Plastered on the walls were photos of the food they serve, including dishes, I've not seen since I stepped on the plane in Asia to return to the US. The menu is extensive. It's a mainly cantonese cuisine type of place. So a lot of items with roots from Hong Kong. Such as Wonton soup with egg noodles, Beef Chow HoFun (and yes Ho is fun VERY fun).

The wonton soup with egg noodle is VERY authentic. The dumpling is filled with meats and not wrap. The veggie amount is the same as any you would get while dining in Asia. There were five wontons and the clear soup is as real and tasty as any in Hong Kong, Singapore or China(s). 

The House Pot Stickers are good. Presumably, these dumplings are a house recipe. The dipping sauce is somewhat Americanized but taste good. The Pot Stickers sauce I'm used to is just black vinegar and ginger.

The Beef Chow HoFun....well, yum! It's a standard item in Cantonese eateries all over Asia and it's nice to find one so similar. I've always like my food hot (spicy hot!) so I add the table hot sauce to it....and it just doesn't get anymore authentic then this.

The tea is a MUST TRY!  Hot or cold, basically it's your regular black tea made real strong with a healthy dose of evaporated milk to taste. If you are having the tea hot, don't forget to add sugar (available on the table) to your liking (I didn't see artificial sweeteners and didn't bother to ask)

The wait staff is a pleasant crew and spoke decent English. They accommodated my children and were helpful when asked.

If you are looking for an authentic chinese dining experience, look no further! Because at the end of your meal, you get only the check. NO fortune cookies!! 





Though my 3  year-old did ask \"where's the cookie?\" OMG what have I done to my kids?!"}
{"text":"Food: 4
Decor: 2
Service: 3

I came here with two Cleveland friends on my weekend trip to Cleveland. Having tried to steer away from Asian food in OH, I was surprised to end up at this place for lunch.

We ordered eggplant with beef, a large soup with egg and pork, fried donut, and sweet and sour pork. They were all pretty good, and we had plenty for leftovers after for dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places in the area. Authentic.  The servers barely speak English but they are much nicer than the servers from other Chinese restaurants nearby. 

I love coming here because of the salted baked three flavor seafood and the Three Flavor shrimp dumplings with Noodles. There is even a tofu dish that is my favorite here.

I love that when I come here is mostly Asian customers. 

Also I love that they use the hot chili oil! I don't have to ask for it"}
{"text":"Probably the restaurant I've been MOST often in all of Cleveland, period. Go with a big group and share everything so you can try all the amazing food, leave stuffed with leftovers, and be shocked... SHOCKED.. by the amazing prices, usually less than $12-15 per person after tip without holding back on ordering, at all.  

YUM.  This is better than Szechuan and their good, but one note flavor and over salty everything, and is not quite as good, but significantly cheaper than Siam down the street.  Those are my 3 spots for authentic Chinese food, and Wonton is easily the best balance of taste and price. 

I mean, if you are coming from china or a giant city like LA, Chicago, or NYC, this probably won't impress you, but for Cleveland, its the go to for Chinese fair."}
{"text":"Came here with the parents the other evening and was greeted by a cheerful waiter and the wonderful aromas of East Asian deliciousness. We were given three menus: one \"Americanized\" menu and two Cantonese and Hong Kong-style menus. We ordered the cumin beef, chili chicken, and the chicken fried rice with basil off of the HK menu. Each dish was delicious! The beef was especially tender and spicy, and the other dishes were extremely flavorful. Portions were quite hearty and definitely able to be shared. I think we alarmed the poor elderly Chinese couple dining next to us because we were wolfing down our food with such bestial glee and ferocity...oops :) Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best wonton noodle soup I have ever eaten (and I have been all over China so I think that could count for something). Because my father can cook excellent Chinese food I am rather picky about the quality. (Basically, the one area I am a snob in is Chinese food). So believe me when I say...if you ever get close enough to this place you should make it a point to stop and eat here. The prices are just right, and even if you don't order the soup...it is hard to go wrong. I had the duck rice and my father had the wonton soup and we shared. It was beyond words (in the best way possible). Too bad we were just passing through and I don't live close to this place or I would be a regular (they might even get annoyed at how frequently I'd be going or start handing out frequent dining cards). 

Now if you are sitting at home, wondering where to go and for some reason reading my review to decide where to go to eat tonight....you have found the place, so what are you waiting for? Go! I promise you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid place in Cleveland to get Cantonese food. The turnip cakes are definitely the best that you can get in the downtown Cleveland area. Wonton Gourmet is also the only restaurant in Cleveland you can get Hong Kong style baked pork chop over rice, which is a plus. The HK lemon tea and HK milk tea are nice too. Overall, a great place to go if you want delicious, authentic Cantonese food."}
{"text":"Heard from an inside source (okay, just a fellow fan who's been dining there longer) that the chef there can cook both authentic Hong Kong-style Cantonese dishes not even included on the menu (e.g. San Mian Huang--crispy noodles with gravy and shreded meat on top so that you get both a soft and crunchy textures!) AND spicy Hunan dishes.  Note to self (and all you reading this): try the water-boiled fish or chicken, in spicy Hunan style.  It's supposed to be truly sizzling and aromatic."}
{"text":"I came here twice for their SUPER DELICIOUS Chinese food. One was last summer, another was this spring. Since last summer, I couldn't stop to miss their food. All their food we ordered were so delicious! Therefore, my friends and I decided to come here again in spring break this year. Until now, I've moved to west coast, I still miss their Chinese food. I hope one day I can visit Cleveland again for this restaurant! TRUST ME!! If you are Chinese, you will like this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just was here today ... did the shrimp dumpling noodle n roast duck noodle ... wow yummy ... been awhile since I tasted such good dishes"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and her family love this place. I am a convert! This is traditionally considered Hong Kong style comfort food. The Hong Kong diner food is mostly concentrated on the little yellow menu, so that's where I order from most of the time.

As I said, it's comfort food, and I feel very comforted whenever I go. It's nothing like the Americanized Chinese food I grew up with. They serve a few things most Americans probably won't eat--like crispy fried pork intestine, which I still have not developed the courage to try--but on the whole it's just a much more authentic, fresh, and non-artificial tasting Chinese food experience. 

It seems like everything is amazing, but I particularly love the rice porridge (with Chinese donuts), the ningo, and the pan fried noodles. 

Oh... and the turnip cakes.

Oh, don't forget the pot stickers.

and the rice rolls. Oh my gosh, I could go on and on.

What's funny is that they have a couple of servers who don't speak any English or Cantonese (only Mandarin) so even though I'm there with a bunch of Chinese people they're still using sign-language to communicate with the waiter. 

One more thing. It helps if you know that friendly service is not really a Chinese concept. It's more like, we give you food, you give us money, then you leave. I like the matter-of-fact and honest nature of that transaction. That said, I think the service is pretty decent, they get the food out quickly most of the time. We waited a long time once, but that never happened again.

I had better stop. I feel like I'm in danger of writing the great American novel here. I could go on and on, but the truth is, you have to try it! Go in, eat, enjoy. Don't forget: yellow menu."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Cantonese food that you can find in Cleveland.  The restaurant is full of  Asian people.  This is the favorite hangout spot of the fobs at the Case grad school, and the default Chinese restaurant that my Asian friends go to as well.  They speak to each other in Chinese, they have Chinese on their menu and ghetto pictures of the food selections on the wall.

The food is a bit greasy at times, but with Cleveland's standards, it's quite authentic and quite good."}
{"text":"We just picked up our takeout order from Wonton Gourmet & BBQ and I would not recommend them. Our order was incorrect... I ordered 2 wonton's and received 2 wonton soups. The sweet & sour chicken came with 1/2 of a ?container of sweet & sour sauce. The order did not include any soy sauce and when I realized this 15 minutes after picking up our food, we had to turn back around. When requesting more sweet & sour sauce they wanted to charge for it. The food was bland along with being cold at? this time. The lo mein was cold, the ?chicken was cold and the ?soup was not tasty."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Chinese!  LOVE!  The Turnip Cakes...A...Mazing!"}
{"text":"I am slightly ashamed that I eat the food here often enough that the staff recognize me not only in person, but my voice over the phone when I order food for pick-up. This place is an amazing value and you get an unreasonably large amount of food for the price. They do use MSG, but you can ask them not to add it. Some of my personal favorites are:

Salt and Pepper Pork Chop: Definitely not for those on a diet, but it tastes so good that it does not stop me from ordering it nearly every time I come here. This dish goes especially well with the accompanying guilt. Not too much breading, plenty of meat, and seasoned appropriately. I have tried this dish at numerous Chinese restaurants, and this actually stands out as one of the better ones. It will be overly fried on a rare occasion.

Fish/Beef in Chili Oil: Just when you thought the typical entrée here was large, this one is even larger. As expected, given that the dish is immersed in chili oil, it will be fairly salty and spicy, and tastes best with a good amount of rice. This alone feeds me for 3 or 4 meals - and I can eat A LOT.

Beef with Bitter gourd: Not much to say here, tastes exactly as it should.

Beef Chow Fun: Also an unusually large amount of food.

Fish with Seasonal Vegetables: The fish is breaded, but not overly so, and also tastes pretty good. One side benefit of this dish is that the vegetables provides the illusion of a healthy, well-balanced meal.

Overall, this place is slightly on the greasy/salty side, but is otherwise pretty authentic Chinese food and tastes great. This is my default place to eat when I am too busy or lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food! I recommend this place to all my friends. The dishes here are so good and remind me of food I had when I was in China."}
{"text":"Spectacular. Huge and beguiling menu. Avoid the Americanized stuff and get some of the authentic dishes. We started with the chive dumplings and cold and spicy noodles before moving on to the beef with eggplant, shrimp dumpling soup with noodles, and pea greens with garlic. Each dish had sophisticated layers of flavor that really impressed us. Service is very fast - maybe too fast for some. This is not a white tablecloth place, but what's coming out of the kitchen would not be out of place at an incredibly pricey restaurant. Even after overeating, we had enough to feed four people with our leftovers the next day. So, six amazing meals for $50. Awesome. I'm really eager to go back."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, unassuming,
and has really good Chinese comfort food.
Flavorful congee and noodle soups
with big portions and very reasonable prices
Their entrees are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet is my favorite Asian restuarant in Cleveland's Asia Town.  If you're looking for a place with delicious Chinese food, good portion sizes, and reasonable prices, this is the place to go to.

The restaurant itself is pretty small.  At dinner hour, it may be difficult to seat a very large group.  The servers are friendly.  Ordering is easy - pictures of the dishes are on the wall so you know exactly what you're going to be eating.

The jade tofu dishes here are my favorite.  You can either order this dish with pork or fish.  Jade tofu is an egg tofu that is fried on the outside and soft on the inside.  The gravy with this dish (and most of the dishes here) is delicious.  Vegetables are included too.  I also think that the noodle dishes (pan fried noodles, beef chow haw fun) are very good.  When my friends go here, we also frequently order the spicy fish and the Szechuan eggplant (with or without chicken).  The spicy fish dish isn't my favorite in Asia Town, but it is really good.  You get a lot of fish.  Recently, I had the beef with Chinese broccoli and was happy that the meat was very tender and tasty.

So if you're looking to try a good Chinese restaurant with a small group of friends, check this place out.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't been a big fan of this food in many years because of how much oil and sugar most places use.  There's a lot of fried food too.  This is a great authentic Chinese restaurant, however, and if you choose carefully you can eat a nutritious and healthy meal here.  I loved the chive pot stickers.  I chose poorly with the twice fried pork and the fried fish.  They were both seriously oily and while the flavors were outstanding it was too much for me.  I think one shared for a few people with some of their vegetable dishes and some soup would have been smarter.  The neighborhood is off-putting to say the least and the restaurant is nothing to look at on the inside but this place is a jewel nonetheless.  I would definitely return and try more!  Order off the wall or their non-American leaning menu."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special the food was over oiled and absolutely flavorless. The 3 dumpling soup these other folks are ravening about smelled like a barn and was virtually tasteless. Even the tea was completely flavorless. You want authentic your much better off at Li Wah down the street."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style dishes, which was a pleasant change from regular asian/chinese food."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious Chinese food. The noodle soups (3 Flavor Dumpling with Noodle is a MUST) are wonderful. The Sauteed Tung choy is good and garlicky. 

For the more adventurous eater, the Salt Baked Soft Shell Crab is one of the best dishes on the menu.

Make sure you get all 3 menus and don't be afraid to order off the pictures on the wall.  Nothing has ever disappointed -- this is a place that we crave!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a late dinner. Had for more food than expected, great service, and the food was excellent. Had shrimp wanton soup, general tso chicken, and jade tofu with fish, and a spring roll. Loved all of our food. Will definitely be going back. Thx yelp for the other great reviews; I don't think we would have went to this place without all the positive feed back!"}
{"text":"oh wonton gourmet
a happy ending indeed
pleasure of the mouth

I'll be damned if this joint can't hang with any real Chinese places anywhere.  In our fair city there are loads of American Chinese craptastic places, buffets, which range from gross to wretched, but this place is the real deal. No General Tso's chicken scraps, no sweet and sour dog food, but a myriad of authentic and flavorful dishes. 

The cumin lamb was a hot and spicy treat that packed a wallop, but was not some test of manhood to eat. You could taste a lot more than the peppers. The chive dumplings were homemade and the filling was very flavorful.  Szechwan beef was wonderfully nuanced. Sesame chicken -best I ever tasted.

The ubiquitous flat screen showed a Chinese flick. Interestingly, the sound was on and the movie was not dubbed, but it had Chinese subtitles as well. 
Double happiness?

Carry on..."}
{"text":"First off just by looking at the building you wonder to yourself are these yelpers serious about this place. Well they are the beef chow fun was delicious and the governors chicken and chive dumpling were great. Only thing holding back from me giving them a 5 stars is I wasn't a fan of the service, for it's hard to understand a waitress that speaks no English."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is always so friendly and the food is amazing!  The environment is a little bit of a dive, but I find it quite charming.  I always love how whenever I stop in here there are often a mix of asian locals and groups of people of different races!

This place is great for fair priced, yummy food!"}
{"text":"Portions are wayyy to much, and the taste is meh. I got sesame chicken with fried rice and egg roll. Coming from NYC I wasn't expecting much but this place was depressing compared to back home. The rice was bland. The egg roll had too much cabbage inside, and the chicken was cripsy on the outside but inside seemed under cooked. The sauce wasn't the best either. Overly not a great experience. Kinda pricey too for Chinese food. Which I only ate about 10% of."}
{"text":"Loved the spicy wontons! They were sweet and hot and I totally recommend them! Hope to go back and try more foods next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food ever.  It's Hong Kong style.  Chili Chicken is amazing.  Spicy beef, sauteed short ribs, cumin lamb...its all good.  Portions are family size.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is my #1 go to on the East Side, and is the best traditional Chinese in Cleveland hands down. 

I've been here 10+ times over the last few years by myself and in groups. The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. Portions are large and splitting 3 dishes amongst 4 friends is usually perfect. 

I'd suggest the cumin lamb if u r a fan of tha heat."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Chinese food in Cleveland!!!  :). Super clean, parking lot, Chinese television while you dine.... It's great!
Excellent beef chow fun, calamari and wonton.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend. I been to most of the Chinese restaurants in cle. Best Chinese place here. I always get the salt baked or HK pork chops here."}
{"text":"Cleveland Chinatown is pretty lackluster, but Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is a gem!

The kung pao chicken is sooooooooo good. The best I have ever had, and that is saying ALOT. (I'm craving it...as i type..and as i eat my breakfast....:p) Other than that, the mapo tofu and watercrest with garlic  that we ordered were pretty standard. I would have been more adventurous and ordered a few dishes that were more authentic, but I didn't want to overwhelm my non-Asian friend..

I thought the prices were reasonable for the amount of food we got, but the portions per order are definitely for sharing. There is no way one person would be able to finish one entire order by themselves (we tried, and had a pound of food left over...). You've been warned! (:

Anywho, I'll definitely be back if I find myself in the Cleveland area again! (:"}
{"text":"We been frequently here often. My lastest craving is the steamed fresh oyster with black bean sauce. It is served minimum 3 per order. They are gigantic oyster steamed to perfection. 

Word of advise, this place is always packed and food is really good."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese take-out restaurant atmosphere, but this place has really good everyday Chinese food!  Their foods range from simple lunch foods - wonton noodles, porridge, Chinese donut, fried rice, BBQ meats - to the more elaborate dinner plates - seafood, tripe, a slew of stir-fried vegetables, hot pots, etc.  Lunch is about $10pp, and dinner is around $20pp.  You know this place is authentic - besides the Chinese news and dramas playing on the TV, the restaurant is filled with Chinese people like me!"}
{"text":"Out standing Cantonese food and taste of China.  Have food from Taiwan,  China, Hong Kong style all in one!  Amazing combination but authentic taste of each. Price is low!Will sure come again!"}
{"text":"Came here often. This is a hidden gem in Asiatown. If you don't know what to order, just order off the wall with numbers or point at others' food. Don't expect everyone to speak proficient English here. I loved everything I tried off the wall--- be prepared for spicy dishes. They are almost all spicy so ask if you don't know!"}
{"text":"I really meant to be good, honest. No, really, I did! 

Like most people my age I have to work hard to watch my weight. The plan today was to order the Roasted Duck on Noodles HK Style soup and the Salt Baked Calamari (which I had last week...omg, can't begin to tell you...).  BUT, I was only going to have a piece or two of the calamari and take the rest home for dinner. 

What happened? Well...flavors happened. Big, bold, amazing, addicting, stupidly-great flavors happened. It wasn't my fault at all. They hijacked my willpower, put it into a plastic bag along with two 30 pound weights and tossed it overboard into the deepest and darkest part of Lake Erie. Like taking candy from a retired person. I was done. 

The soup was just outstanding (see pic) to the last tiny droplet. I would order it again in a nanosecond. And that calamari...my vocabulary and writing skills aren't up to the task of expressing how flavorful it was. It's my new BFF (best fish forever). Chill, Marine Biologists, I know it's a cephalopod. 

I usually don't like restaurants that are cramped, noisy, and look like they were decorated by a sophomore linebacker from Ohio State, but Wonton Gourmet is my favorite Asian restaurant in this city by FAR.  And since I'm usually one of only a handful (if that) of Caucasians present, I'd say that's an opinion shared by people who know a hell of a lot more than I about this kind of food."}
{"text":"Possibly Cleveland's best offering in the Chinese category, Wonton Gourmet is a must visit if you are looking for authentic chinese cuisine with a wide range of choices.  Tung Choy with Garlic is one of the most flavorful greens dishes ever and the Cumin Beef and Mao Pao Tufo are all my favorites.  Also, the Salted Bake options are unique.  Be advised many of the Shrimp dishes come WITH the shells on and while I know it is customary for many countries to eat the shells...I just can't get past it!

No, it isn't fancy dining and won't Wow you with ambience...however...the food makes me grateful this restaurant is part of our amazing food scene in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The food here was just average but it was the highest reviewed Chinese place we saw in Cleveland.  Hate to knock it but this was the first Asian restaurant  (and not the last) on our East Coast Tour that we were disappointed in."}
{"text":"Oh man!! I'm definitely ordering food from here again!! I got delivery through skipthedishes.com I ordered the dumplings/ pot stickers and veggie fried rice. It was probably some of the best pot stickers I have ever had (and i've had a lot) also i'm a huge condiment person and the ponzu sauce with the pot stickers was crazy good. The Vegetable fried rice was loaded with veggies, carrots, bean sprouts, peas, bamboo shoots, onions, eggs, broccoli and more! Cooked to perfection and lightly seasoned with soy (your probably going to want to add some soy), I asked for real soy on the side and was given a cup of that since we all know the stuff in those packets is filled with dyed salt water 90% of the time. Check this place out for sure! Can't wait to explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food. I went super boring and traditional as I was nervous to go outside of my comfort zone. I wish I would have because all of the food I saw looked absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Our family usually always come here for family dinner or sometimes just a quick lunch . The food is very authentic and you don't have to wait that long. I give them a four star, because the service is not always so great and the older waitress would ask for a tip when she serves us ."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food. I'm Chinese and I love their food. I come at least once a month or so, at one time it was once a week almost. Come with a large group and do family style. The restaurant is kind of a hole in the wall compared to other places but the food more than makes up for it. Service is good, pricing is good."}
{"text":"MMMmmm!! This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. I liked it more than Siam Cafe, which I've been to a few times and wasn't wowed. I went with a large group and we tried a number of dishes and ate family style.  We had the Orange beef, Singapore noodles, eggplant with shredded pork in pan-fried noodles, and seafood with fish maw soup, Jade tofu+fish, iced milk tea. EVERYTHING was delicious! (I probably would pass on the Jade tofu and iced milk next time, though..there still isn't a fantastic bubble tea place in Cleveland. Koko is where i go for my bubble tea fix, but it's nothing compared to Tenren's in NYC or Joy Yee's in Chicago)All of us in our group of 10 was satisfied with yummies in our tummies.

It's authentic Chinese food. You know the Asian food will be good when most of the patrons are Asian and the waitstaff can't speak English. That's just how it is here in the Midwest with first/second generation Asian-Americans.

It was soo cheap, too! Less than $12/person and we ate our hearts out!  So much more satisfying than going to a gourmet restaurant. I was just at Lolita's last night, which was good, but not as good as this place. I'd rather eat this type of homecooking than spend thrice as much with a bunch of yuppies and rich ppl.

I'll definitely be coming here on a regular basis! :) YOU WILL LOVE IT, TOO! I promise! Warning: You will be outnumbered if you're white. ;)

Oh yeah, the waitstaff is kind of blah, though. She kept on asking us if we had a coupon, and I said, \"Oh no, but I wish we did!\" Then she said, \"Well we don't take coupon!\" And I looked at her confused, like \"Ummm..okay, so you want us to leave then?\" Lol.  But it's just a language barrier. I guess there was some sorta scam from restaurant.com, and they don't take the coupon they put out, FYI, if you have one."}
{"text":"Shrimp wonton egg noodle soup was really good! The soup is rich in a seafoody way (reminds me of Japanese ramen), and the thin noodles are chewy. Not fancy descriptions, but it was delicious!

Schezwan double baked pork was also very good. A spicy dish. Comes w/ as many dried peppers as the meats themselves, but it's not THAT spicy if you don't eat the peppers. But the pork! Their textures are chewy and at times even crunchy. The sauce is tasty. It'd be a really good entree to order for a group, but I wouldn't recommend only eating Schezwan double baked pork by itself as a meal, since it's spicy and one-dimensional; you get kind of sick of eating it half way through; though this may be true for all the Chinese meat entree...

And I'd follow the advice from the fellow yelpers on picking an appetizer and an entree for two people."}
{"text":"Oh wonton gourmet, why did you get my hopes so high?

My friend and I were hungry after an evening Sunday service, so we looked around for a place to grab some food. Dumpling soup sounded amazing, and we called wonton gourmet and bbq. What? Open until 11:45pm! Hallelujah! Off we went.

Walked into the restaurant and was seated right away. Greeted by a mix of Chinese music videos blasting as well as pictures on the wall of their dishes (huh? that's weird... ), we looked at the menu. I got the three flavor dumpling soup- which consisted of some shrimp, some dumpling which seemed to have Chinese sausage in it...and something else. The noodles....were not great. The broth also....not so good. The noodles tasted like they were like...instant ramen noodles. Not the quality that I'm used to tasting at dumpling restaurants in Toronto or Cali.

My friend got the tomato beef chow fun. For some reason, they only had it over rice...and he wanted noodles, so he asked for them. The waitress seemed to make a big deal about it, having to ask the other waiter, then the owner, then the chef, etcera....and then when he asked her how much it was... it was 3 dollars more than what it would cost on rice. Geesh. Any normal Chinese restaurant would have instantaneously substituted it. Okay, yes, we both couldn't speak....but still! C'mon.

Don't get me wrong, the dishes were pretty big. My friend said it was \"kind of what I'm used to from Texas, Seattle, Cali\" of his dish.... I was definitely disappointed in mine.

Next time I'll just cook it at home...it'll be better. :P Or maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff....."}
{"text":"Had the beef chow fun. Fantastic! Can't wait to come back. Over 100 meals on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wonton Gourmet is probably one of the best chinese restaurants in Cleveland. However, I do have mixed feelings about it. Here's why:

Its menu focuses mainly on mid to southern chinese cuisine and doesn't have a lot of northern chinese cuisine selections. Some of my favorite dishes there include: jade tofu, spicy fish, cumin lamb, and many many others.  I will have to warn you that they put a lot of MSG in their dish (just as any chinese restaurants in town) and you'll feel very thirsty afterwards.

Some of my bad experiences there include:
1) one time we ordered a vegetable dish. After we were almost done with it, I saw a blue rubber band on the plate... So my guess was they didn't wash the vegetable properly - they probably just rinsed them under the water and didn't even remove the rubber band. That was a little upsetting. So I talked to the manager and they took off the price of that vegetable dish from our bill.

2) One of the new waiters was very friendly, almost too friendly. He was joking about my last name but I thought that was very rude and insensitive and even immature of him. So I confronted him later and he sincerely apologized.

So, I will go back if I'm really craving for some southern chinese cuisines but I would be careful with everything. Something new and unexpected might happen next time!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Wonton Gourmet on a recent chilly weeknight before seeing South Pacific at PlayhouseSquare.  With its proximity to the theater district and abundance of free parking, we often plan to hit up a new spot in Asia Town before catching a show at the theater.

Wonton Gourmet was great!  Friendly, prompt service, and excellent food!  We had the wonton soup to start, and then for entrees we ordered the Szechwan Chicken and Beef with Chinese Eggplant.  The beef dish was a little spicy, but both were excellent!

The atmosphere was your standard Chinese restaurant with one unusual feature: the large-screen TV in the back of the restaurant that was playing a Chinese variety show, which I can only describe as a variation on America's Got Talent in Mandarin.  Everyone else in the restaurant was watching with rapt attention, so we tuned in, and it turned out to be entertaining!

Most entrees were $10 or less, and we enjoyed eating the leftovers for three days.  You could really do well to share a small appetizer and an entree.

I will say that the menus were a little confusing for this first-timer: there were three separate food menus, and by the time we left, I still couldn't figure out how they were organized, but they also have helpful huge color photos on the walls that correspond to the numbers on the menu, so that helped, too.

We'll be back, Wonton Gourmet!"}
{"text":"I just want to say I stopped eating Chinese take out and I hate when an ethnic group changes their cusine to suit Americans . This restaurant is pretty authentic I stopped and had carry out the Szechuan Chicken and Wonton soup it tasted like the real deal it was nice and spicy .I couls taste the asian spices and the Authenticity of the dish which is the whole purpose. The menu is huge alot of these dishes Ive never ate like the soup with fish in it etc. Check it out if you want the real deal I will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you Wonton Gourmet --I understand now.

I understand that General Tso's chicken is not supposed to be rock hard fried to death nuggets of leather covered in sweet glop.  It is supposed to be tender, juicy chicken enhanced with a delicate, complex sauce that mingles sweet, spicy and savory flavors.

I understand that dumplings are not gobs of mystery meat inside tough chewy dough, but rather bits of actual shrimp and identifiable vegetables delicately encased in thin, tender wrapping.

Mei fun is not one solid gelatinous mass covered in \"brown sauce'.  IT'S SUPPOSED TO TASTE GOOD!!!!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you Wonton Gourmet for showing me the light.  Thank you for not dumbing down the food for a non-Asian customer.  You made my Chinese New Year happy, indeed!"}
{"text":"Good place to get some Chinese food. Usually come with a bunch of friends and order a bunch of dishes to share. This place gives a good amount of food. Come hungry!!

Below is what we usually order:
-Mapo tofu
-salted pork chops
-jade tofu 
-chili chicken 
-sizzling steak in blk pepper sauce"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Wife and I got the eight treasures hot pot and it was bursting with flavor! Also best pot stickers I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"So this is what Chinese food is supposed to taste like! Holy crap! So good!

Honestly, I was glad to be in dining with Chinese speaking friends or I may have struggled a bit with ordering.  I had no idea what was good (or what my friend ordered for me!) but when it all arrived at our table the portions were huge and delicious!  My favorites were the black pepper short ribs and the shrimp wonton soup.  We ordered four meals for three people and we had enough leftovers for probably another three people.  The portions are freakishly big!

I'm so glad to have tried this place out.  No fakey MSG-laden flavors here.  Everything is flavorful in an authentic way and I can't wait to go back!  I've been thinking about that sweet and sour sauce all day..."}
{"text":"Since moving here, we wondered where the local Asians in the community ate. Now we know! I was so elated to see uncles and aunties there for a mid-Sunday brunch. The venue is cozy and pleasant. Once inside, I was taken back by the friendly and prompt service. It was almost difficult to order from the menu with pictures of the entrees bordering the room. 
We ordered a couple quasi dim sum dishes--turnip cake and rice cake with chinese donut. The turnip cake was a hit, and the rice cake with chinese donut was too oily. Probably better to order it with shrimp or beef next time. For entree, we had the egg noodle with wonton and bbq pork. It's served piping hot and very fresh. The wonton isn't mom's caliber, but it will do for Cleveland. 
Good to know-- Prices are very reasonable. Portions hefty. Super clean restroom. Closed Tuesdays. Closes like at Midnight when it is open. No duck or pork hanging behind glass, so you can bring timid eaters in."}
{"text":"I kept reading reviews for Wonton and finally gave it a whirl. My friend and I split different things off the \"real\" or \"Hong Kong\" menu or whatnot. I really didn't understand most of it and did not feel like looking at the pictures on the wall. Although they did help. I was thankful that there was a guy sitting next to us who could fill us in and advise on what to order, the differences in Chinese cuisines etc... He drives in once about every two weeks from Youngstown. He claims that on certain days, Wonton makes better food than he has had in the major cities known for Chinese food. The TV shows were interesting. There were some really interesting people inside and a lot of friendly individuals. I had a beef and chinese broccoli dish. There were nice, big chunks of fresh ginger included and the flavors were great. I think Peking pork chops was the name of the other dish I tried. They were very good. I cannot wait to go back and try some more food there. The price to portion ratio is outstanding and one $8 meal can easily be stretched into two."}
{"text":"This place looks crappy and creepy on the outside. Be bold and fearless, young (or notsoyoung) eater -- the food is worth crossing potentially awkward cultural boundaries for. And your car will be safe, I promise.

We (le moms, le pops and I) were seated very quickly even though the place was chock full of Chinese people (and other people.. but mostly a lot of Chinese speakers). They give you menus (2 diff menus, look at both) and there are pictures (with English and numbers!) on the wall. 

We had:
** Shrimp wontons with noodle (forget the noodle but the shrimp wontons are awesome! believe me because I generally think wontons suck! plus I mean.. it's in the name...)
* mustard green soup with pork and tofu (#14? tofu so soft... broth so clean yet flavorful (ginger)... pork so... so GOOD. comparable to the soup at Siam Cafe... I'm not sure which is better but I might say WG's)
- crispy whole fried sole hk style (#39. not bad. dad demolished it. but not as stand out as the other stuff)
- szechuan pork and eggplant (i love eggplant. and i love this dish. i do i do i dooo)
- mapo tofu and meat (I believe the meat was pork. this was good, spicy, but not too special)
*** JADE TOFU AND FISH (or something it might be 38) YOU. MUST. ORDER. THIS. It is delicious! My mom shouted when she had a bite because it was that good. (And then my dad did and then I did.)
- cold milk tea -- personal preference, this is nummy to me

Believe me when I say  -- 1 appetizer and 1 main dish is enough for normal people! DON'T over order because the food does NOT taste as good the next day (it might even suck). Just come back sometime like I know I will. 

Lived in Cleveland since day 400 or so of life and this was my first time here. If you haven't been you are missing out on part of the wonderful thing that is Cleveland.

*edit* If it helps..  my parents and I greatly prefer this to Hunan East (different style of Chinese food, I know)."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything is made from scratch from a small open kitchen. 
Staff is very accommodating.
Menu is a little confusing (there's 3) best bet is to order off the photos on the Wall. Its not fancy not even close ..but its amazing. The wontons are being made as they serve you. 
They have family style tables that turn to share with your guests. There's only three of us so, we ordered potstickers, veggie ramen, wonton pork noodle and pepper steak. Honestly everything is amazing here ..but the soup is the star! I will be back soon. Thank you Wonton!"}
{"text":"At first I was a little worried when I found this place because it seemed to be the only joint in the area that didn't have a super long wait, but because of the good yelp reviews I went anyway. Now I'm not saying this is the best way to judge a place but when you walk in to an Asian restaurant that is packed with mostly Asians it's a good bet that the food is on point. We had lo mein, pot stickers and sesame chicken. All were amazing. I wish I lived closer so I could explore the rest of the menu. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Good solid authentic whole-in-the-wall Chinese food.

I've been here twice now: once for a quick bowl of noodles for lunch alone, and once for a meal with a group of friends.  The food was fine both times.  The service is quick and efficient, there's nice pictures on the wall if you don't know what you want.  The shrimp dumpling noodles were very good.  And it really is authentic Chinese food -- the kind of food I might find myself eating with my Chinese bf's family.

That being said, it didn't blow my mind or anything.  I've had better.  I can see myself going back based on convenience, location, etc.  But then again, I wouldn't miss it if I don't...

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the Jellyfish and there may, or may not be a next time. It was not bad food, but when my friend said people were comparing it to the most authentic HK in Cle, I didn't taste that in the place. 

The quantity was on point I have to say that. I may go back at a time when I'm really hungry. You know the time when you might just pull into McDonalds if you happen to pass one, you all know what I'm talking about! Prices were on point also. 

My dumpling soup was pretty darn good, but the chicken I ordered was a little spicy with no warning of it. Was not a fan of that. I think that is actually the only negative about the place. This is a positive review people, I myself just realized this. I am now staring at 3 stars and am moving it up to 4. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I come to Cleveland once every two weeks or so and I come here every time with my family! Their twice cooked pork is super amazing. Fatty but oh so good. I'm also a big fan of the fried squid lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. 

What else is great about this place is the portions. While the price is $ to $$, the portions are definitely good. More yum for your buck."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing don't let the exterior fool you. The delicious looking photos of food dishes kept us ordering more and more. Everything we order was quite good and came out quick. Price is very reasonable as well.

Would recommend this to anyone who loves great variety of asian dishes."}
{"text":"If you like fried, spicy, or noodles this is the place for you. This is the type of place if you want your food quick and no frills. Menu is on the wall along with a small menu of noodles and congee. For dinner, I ordered some entrees off the wall... cumin lamb, fried seafood platter, and schezwan eggplant... everything was good and spicy. Next time I come though, i'm looking forward to getting some soup noodles and pork and 1000 year old egg congee (with the doughnuts of course!)"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was very fresh and flavorful. The shrimp wonton soup was so satisfying on the rainy day. I also had the best mu shu pork I've ever eaten. This is a no frills restaurant serving amazing food."}
{"text":"The Verdict: YASSSS! Actually authentic cantonese/Chinese food in Cleveland! Thank goodness!

The Food: I actually come here almost every weekend with my friends. The food is great, we eat family style and try a new dish now and then. Great hit dishes are ho-fun (a type of long flat noodles), shredded pork udon, salt and pepper pork, Beijing style pork (it's sweet and sour tasting), Szechuan-style pork, and pan-fried noodles. Their veggies are also very fresh. The dishes are huge and very affordable! We always go home full and satisfied.

The Extras: They have free private parking on the right side. They are open very late. Sometimes it can be crowded, so you know it's legit! But that's only rarely. The menu comes in English and Chinese, and waiters and waitresses are very nice. They take credit card."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Cantonese food!  Their noodle and wonton soups are amazing!  They also have congee and bubble tea.  It's just like the food I had while in Hong Kong.  Most of their popular menu items are displayed with photos on the walls.  Just tell the server what number looks good and order it!

Some of my favorites are the salt baked squid, jade tofu, and Szechuan eggplant.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are quite large, so come with a group and enjoy! ^_^"}
{"text":"Ni hao.  Can't get to Hong Kong today on the next flight out on the orient express.  Baked pork hong kong style is my favorite here. Chinese satellite tv is on to catch up on what's happening in the old country or to see the latest game show that will be in the states in a matter of weeks. If you don't know what to get or speak mandarin, just point to the pics that illustrate the dishes on the wall. Go ahead try that dish that looks like chicken. It may just be eel or squid and I'm sure it's good. Bring your laptop with rosetta stone to learn mandarin so you can understand what the locals are saying about you. For you non adventurous types there still is an americanized menu for your faint heart."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write this review, because this is a restaurant that I have loved for quite a while now, and could always expect consistency from, but this place has most definitely slipped in quality since the previous owners & chef left. Even though its still one of the only restaurants in Cleveland that offers authentic Cantonese style dishes, the quality of the ingredients has been declining in the past year. The last couple of times I came, their namesake, the wonton noodle, hasn't been as good as it usually is, I chocked it up to a bad visit, and kept trying to come back, but each time I'm disappointed. I no longer get thick pieces of Chinese broccoli, but rather a few measly stems. The wontons are not even close to what they used to be, and the broth has lost its unique flavor.
I'll probably continue to come back here, but I am sad to report that I cannot endorse it wholeheartedly as I used to."}
