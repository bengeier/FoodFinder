{"text":"Five stars for the falafel at Amena!  Similar in style to the falafel in pita at Sababa (hummus, cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, etc), but even better.  Their pita is fluffy & delicious, like soft little pillows.  Falafel are bright green, flavorful, and the perfect size.  You order at the counter and when it's ready, you come up and chose what veggies you want inside.  They also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables, and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava.  Best falafel in pita I've had in Vegas.  I wish I'd tried this place sooner... the creepy Trader Joe's strip mall/dive-y location was throwing me off.  I should have trusted Misty's review because I've been missing out!  And like she said- they sell their pita bread!!"}
{"text":"Great middle eastern deli with several vegetarian choices.  Very inexpensive and extremely friends staff.  Baklava is a must."}
{"text":"The bread makes the meal testier , we ordered the combination plate which it has beef shawarma, chicken shawarma and falafel but it did not have the tomatoes (where's the tomatoes and the pickled turnip) I have to say the waiters was very pleasant but she lacks experience or maybe because she was the cashier busboy waiters."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high star reviews.  This place is OK at best.  The beef sharwma is not what I usually I'm am used to...its basically not.. Service is OK..they forgot my water even though I was the only customer lol. One girl is polite and pretty :)"}
{"text":"Warm, friendly, generous people, amazing food (especially Pita, dolmas, hummus, FALAFEL, eggplant dishes, oh, and balaclava - don't miss that).  and if you like french fries made from fresh potatoes, you're in heaven. One of my favorite spots to eat anywhere, and certainly in Vegas. I'd give it more stars If I could.  Get the home-made lemonade!"}
{"text":"Our first dining experience in Vegas. Exactly what we needed - delicious and authentic food, super friendly service, welcoming environment. The grape leaves were mouth watering, the pita was fresh made, the baklava was delicious. Definitely get food from here at least once."}
{"text":"We were just sort of driving around when we stumbled on this place. I ordered a gyro plate, and I gotta say, it was amazing. The hummus was perfect, the salad was fresh and delicious, and the meat was tender and perfectly seasoned. Desserts looked great too, but I didn't have any. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because my husband wasn't crazy about the lamb chops he ordered... He thought they were small for the price and overdone. But if you're looking for something healthy, they had a lot of great options. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best falafel in town. It is so delicious and fluffy. The baklava is heaven, not too sweet and huge. The katayef is delicious as well.  A little oily but has outstanding flavor.  I've never had a bad meal and the staff is super friendly. The owner is usually there and greets everyone that walks in."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great service. This place has earned a new regular customer."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, great service and hospitality. I don't like to rate restaurants based on 1 trip, 1 dish but from what I ordered, the veggie combo, I loved the hummus and pita bread but the greatest thing that I had was the falafel and baklava. Highly recommended.  My favorite bites from Amena Bakery & Deli are the falafel and the baklava."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. I have trouble deciding what to get because it all tastes good. They make their pita bread! Love this place."}
{"text":"We were headed to Trader Joes as we just checked in to our suite fresh off a long drive from California. We saw the place in the same plaza and quickly looked to see if hey had a Yelp review. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it had a good review and we were starved.   We both ordered combo plates. I asked for no salad, sub baba, she asked no salad, sub tabouli. The staff accommodated us easily. No extra charge. We tried their meat couscous dish per the owners recommendation...OMG, we could not stop eating. Overall friendly staff, good Mediterranean food, large portions. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing . My first time here and I was greeted with some complimentary treats that were delicious ! Not to mention thw guro was very authentic and fantastic . The chef really knows what he's doing , and he really makes you feel at home in the restaurant . I will for sure be back ."}
{"text":"Oh my! Oh my! I am absolutely impressed with this unassuming little deli. The combo plate is just awesome. I had the fries with the combo plate and that took the mixed flavors of the meal to a whole new level. The service is very good and prompt. The food does not arrive fast, which I thought was a good thing. Did not have a fast food ambience or a fast food taste. I travel to Las Vegas every year and this will be a stop I make every time."}
{"text":"WOW! I just happened to be hungry and wandered into this amazing little place!   I bought the fresh baked pita bread - yummy, the hummus - very good, and the most delicious baklava I have ever tasted in my entire life!   Go. Get. It."}
{"text":"This is one of the best middle eastern restaurants we have been to. The owners are so welcoming and kind, and the food is amazing. Hummus with fava beans and falafel was great, warm pita bread was excellent. Don't miss the mint lemonade. We also tried the kunefa and several cookies which were all delicious. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. We are from Salt Lake City and never miss coming here...  Everything on the menu is awesome and the service is so friendly it's shocking.. The fries are amazing and the baklava is the best I have ever had. My wife always gets the falafel.  She swears by it.  I promise if you try this place you will be a loyal repeat customer."}
{"text":"An island of fresh and real food from the middle east.We found it by coincidence and were very positively surprised as the place does not look very inviting from outside. The lentil soup was like the one my grandma used to do, the pita freshly baked , amazing humus and the pitas with tasty fresh ingredients. The deserts  are very authentic and the \"knafe\" tasted better than in Nazareth. We were with our kids and the staff is very helpful and friendly.The only downside is that the exterior atmosphere is very simple."}
{"text":"It was just okay.  The Filafel was pretty okay.  I do not like their yogurt sauce.  Did not even taste like yogurt.  The pita was soft & chewy at the same time, and was really good.  Their Schwarma was lame.  I don't even think they used a spick for it.  It just tasted/felt like pan fried steak.  Very little flavor.  I would not go back there again.     The workers are very nice, but the food was just too bland for me.    I want to warn that I may be a bit biased: I've been to Israel and I've had awesome Filafel & Schwarma in Europe & Turkey, and this does not even come close to the stuff you buy in the streets over there.  Oddly enough, the best Filafel I ever had was in Paris.  So don't let me ruin your experience there.  However, all I can recommend is their Filafel; and it's not a 'glowing' recommendation, but it was okay."}
{"text":"Best baklava recipe i have ever had! and the fresh pita bread is so soft."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Very authentic taste! Definitely one of the best Mediterranean cafe in town."}
{"text":"I drive by this place at twice a week and I never knew that it was here until I yelp Arabic food in the area so I decided to try it out and boy the food here was amazing. I truly recommend this place to anybody who wants to try authentic arab food"}
{"text":"Amena had really good service and have really good plates.They have great prices I recommend it."}
{"text":"Very delicious and very fresh food.  Always make it a point eat here when we're here visiting from Hawaii Very friendly young lady greeting us always.   Eating at the buffets here in Vegas is fine, but sometimes you want home cooked authentic food from this place Excellent!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I died and went to heaven, and heaven has a name: It's Amena.   I haven't had anything Mediterranean since I left Detroit about 2 years ago, mostly because there truly wasn't anywhere to get it in the places I've lived since then. I walked into Amena with high hopes because of good Yelp reviews and I was NOT disappointed.   I had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, lentil soup, and a couple of pastries (baklava and another that I really have no idea what it was, but it was delicious). Everything about it was perfect and just as I had remembered it should taste, and the falafel and baklava might have been the best I've ever tasted. The lentil soup was also exceptional! The staff are very welcoming and made my experience just that much sweeter; I could not have asked for a better local deli/restaurant!   Run, don't walk, to Amena. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had a variety of different things to eat at this restaurant and I can say I was very impressed by the quality of the food. I had the chicken Shawarma plate which was real good. And had some of their freshly made cheese boureakas which was heavenly. And for desert make sure to try the cheese kunaffe and you will be totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Perhaps if you don't have any other Middle Eastern place to compare to, this place would be good. My husband and I dropped in here on our way out of Vegas wanting some light and quick eats. In short, the food was not very authentic and I can say that because I am of Middle Eastern decent. I know this place is rated pretty high on yelp and that is why we dropped in... Maybe we caught the cooks on a down day?  The chicken and \"shawarma\" meat were kinda cold. Shawarma in quotes because it wasn't shawarma; just pieces of meat saut√©ed on a grill with no spice at all. The chicken had I think sumac on it. Whatever spice it was, it definitely wasn't the spices used on shawarma.  The salad was not fresh at all and the hummus bland.  Overall, this place is a bit pricey for the quality and setting.  The positives: service was great, the girls that worked there were very nice and attentive. Oh and the falafel was very fresh. So get a falafel sandwich from there."}
{"text":"Food was quite good. Good kunaffe and kibbeh. I would definitely return. I took a star off because I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows were dirty and the table was super wobbly."}
{"text":"Amena serves dishes from owner Amer Hamed's native Israel, and indeed, there are Israelis here at any given moment, chatting away in Hebrew and eating  shawarmas. The restaurant also doubles as a bakery. Fresh pita bread, hot rolls and delicious pastries and meat pies are made on the premises daily, and that includes Saturdays."}
{"text":"ok.  i like this place.  i've tried many middle eastern / greek places in this town, but this is one of my favorites.  it's definitely a hole in the wall, and despite being a middle eastern restaurant, the owner seems to be israeli and the workers are mexican.  interesting, but you say halal, i say kosher.  anywho, their fallafal is really good, and so are the fries.  they also serve mexican pickled vegetables when you sit down..  why?  i don't know.  but i do recommend this place, and it's close to trader joe's."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful. Absolutely the best hummus I've ever had - it's so creamy! The fresh pitas are to die for, and the owner (who I believe has rung me up every time I've been) is a really nice guy - when I was deciding what to get today, he gave me a sample of the homemade baklava, which was dissolve-in-your-mouth delicious. Amazing place, wish it was a little closer to my house!"}
{"text":"What a quaint and warm place. I felt so welcomed, being completely unfamiliar with this type of cuisine. The lady at the counter was patient with me and I honestly felt like a stranger invited to eat in their home. Food is made with love. Others there revelled at the delicious food and declared their devotion to the place lol!! I got the knuffe and baklava and the bite into the knuffe made me pray outloud! I saw clouds part! Please eat here if you want the same emotion I've described. This is exactly how to run a fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"By far the best kabob in town. The staff is absolutely fantastic. They treat you like you are at their home."}
{"text":"Our family just stopped in for dinner and we couldn't have had a better meal, plus awesome service! The owner was very kind and courteous. Be sure and try the lemonade! Veggie plate offers a great variety of things to try. Chicken shish kabob was delicious. And If you go on Sat they have a special dessert with cheese in it that we all loved. Or try the Kunaffe.  !"}
{"text":"The grape leaves were terrible!! All of the rice was hard and crunchy!! The baklava was ok.. The pita and Babaganoush was really good though.."}
{"text":"I love this place just went there for the second time and the food is so amazing and organic it tastes so good!! I'm sorry I am not a great writer to translate exactly how good it is so you have to go try it the gyro is so good and the eggplant plate was delicious !! can wait to try more of their stuff !!!!! And most important the service is excellent both times I went they explain the whole Manu to me and were so nice !! Oh and the fries are home made as well !!"}
{"text":"Where is the 10 Stars this place it's amazing everything fresh they have the best falafel and Pita also the dessert .it's very clean and friendly the very good prices definitely come coming back"}
{"text":"We came here based on yelp reviews, since we were visiting from out of town. The staff was patient with us, helpful and kind. The place is very clean, small and intimate and bright. The food is amazing!! Everything is fresh and tastes homemade. We're a mixture of vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters and everyone is well fed and happy. Every time we come back to Vegas to visit we will be stopping by :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. A little pricey but well worth it. The owner is really nice and did his best to make sure that we had everything we needed. They ended up misunderstanding our order as we had a party of five and they thought we ordered  five combo plates when we really ordered four. But we told them we would go ahead and take the extra one which they gave us at a discount so that was nice. The hummus was probably the creamiest I ever had, maybe due to extra tahini, which means extra calories but well worth it. And the pitas were home made and like little pita pillows, so soft and tasty. I bought extra to take home. Also, the gave us as many pitas as we wanted without charge while we were eating! The portion size of the combo plate is pretty big and two people could share it. Also, one person in our party ordered mint lemonade, minus the mint, they brought it out with mint in it and she asked them for just the lemonade, they brought her a new one without mint with no complaints or questions asked. Also, they give you little olives and other pickled goods while you wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food !!!!!    This has to be the best middle eastern food Food you can get in Vegas.  It's very Authentic.  The Hummus tastes like my mom makes it . try the shawerma too that was incredible . they make their own bread on premises.  They truly make food with love."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, everything we ordered was on point . The bread is made on the spot , homemade hummus and great service"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in today. First time eating here and it was only my 4th time having Mediterranean food... Enough to compare. I ordered the schnitzel and my husband had the shwarma (sp?). I thought the schnitzel was pretty good. It tastes like a country fried steak but not as crispy on the outside. My husband enjoyed his sandwich as well. Overall, the food was prob a 4/5.  I ordered a glass of water and it was horrible! The last put a lemon in it and it still could not mask whatever was in the glass. I had my husband tried it and he agreed. I usually drink my water with lemon in it and heck, I even drink water from the sink from time to time and that water did not taste right. I told the lady about it and she just dismissed me and said oh well maybe you're not used to the lemon. Uh, no. I'm not used to shitty water. She claims she uses a filter... Well, I guess it's time to change it! I tried to keep my voice as quietly as possible so the other customers wouldn't hear but she kept yelling. She's really rude and honestly, I prob will not come back.  I truly believe that the success of a restaurant is 40% food, 50% customer service and 10% for the rest of the factors."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place . We're going tomorrow to pick up their fresh in house pitas!! Once you try their pitas you will never want to have them any place else. The owner is so nice and remembers us every time we come back. Makes us feel so welcome. Awesome place"}
{"text":"I don't really know what I was eating, but it was definitely delicious. Walked over here after grocery shopping at trader joes and was pleasantly surprised. Delicious authentic middle eastern food. The owner was super friendly and made the experience great. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"And now for something completely different. This place is a tad on the pricey side, but the quality more than makes up for it. Plus, the menu is very different from every other restaurant I've been to. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So glad we found it. The boba gnush and hummus were incredible."}
{"text":"Simply delicious and fresh food at Amena, it feels like home cooking.  I particulary love their pita bread, hummus, falafels and the cookies with walnuts inside. Their service is extra friendly.  I'm looking forward to try more dishes from their menu.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Bed middle eastern food in Vegas !!!! Little pricy for what u get , but he knows his cooking !!! Worth a visit"}
{"text":"Traveled 20 minutes from the strip to get shocked of the quality of food . Worst service . Stay Away"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Vegan, vegetarian and gluten free option.  Great meat dishes as well.  Fresh, bright flavors.  Outstanding service - friendly, helpful and accommodating.  So lucky to have run into Amena on accident!"}
{"text":"I had never been here, stopped in to buy some baklava. Customer service was WONDERFUL. A very nice gentleman let me sample a variety of food, all tasting delicious. I ended up getting several things & was very pleased with everything. Top notch customer service & great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegan friendly place, got amazing food and the people couldn't have been friendlier.  Definitely try the home made lemonade!"}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time last week , I ordered a vegetarian plate and found the hummus and babaganoush and tboulah to be great but the falafel and the grape leaves to be mediocre at best , would like to try thier grilled meat as they seem to be a family run business and very authentic Arab food , would recommend ."}
{"text":"The food is incredible! Everyone in my group loved their dish and collectively agreed we will be going back. They also have great service and make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"Excellent hummus, tahini and red sauce. Will try to sneak in a second visit while here for a conference so that I can try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Favorite Mediterranean food in Las Vegas!   The food is amazing - my boyfriend and I get a bowl of hummus with chicken shawarma on top of it every time, which comes with fresh baked pita bread. The tahini sauce here is the best I have ever had!  The service is what really has brought us back so much. The women that work there are always so sweet to us, the first time we went she brought over water refills and more pita bread. It doesn't look like a restaurant where you get server service, so we were very pleased with our first experience.  The owner Amir is also so great! He takes his time to explain anything to you. Really hospitable.   Also, I can't get enough of their pickled veggies - dipped in hummus! Baklava is also the best I've ever had.  Awesome food - service - and location! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to pick up freshly-made and delicious pita, hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, and pastries. The mint lemonade is blended up to order and always refreshing. I have also dined in for dinner, and left impressed by the quality of the food, generous portions, and the exemplary service."}
{"text":"I eat hummus almost every day. The hummus at Amena Bakery & Deli is fresh and delicious. The pita bread is soft and fluffy. Fluffy pita bread? I never knew such a thing could exist.  The portions were generous, the food was flavorful, and the price was inexpensive given the quality of the food.   I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wanted a good place for lunch so yelped, best lunch in las vegas and this place came up and I love greek food so decided to drive a bit from the northwest to try it.    I couldn't decide what to try, so I got the combo plate with sherwema chicken and beef, hummus, salad and falafel.    I've had falafel a few times in the past but never really knew what the hype was about......until I tried these.  Seriously perfectly flavored with a bit of crunch with every bite.    I have a little love for another little locally greek cafe in the northwest, but I must say, this place kills their falafels and pitas.  Freshly baked pitas are wonderous.  Both the chicken and beef were tender and seasoning was also perfect.   The hummus was good.  The salad was a nice crunchy mixture of chopped lettuce and veggies, but the dressing wasn't my favorite, but then again I've only really liked one greek salad dressing and that was from the little greek gem in the northwest.  Overall, it was cold, crisp and refreshing.  The service was great, the owner was there and very helpful and gave me dessert on the house, baklava.  I'm not sure if I've ever finished a whole piece of baklava because of the sweetness, but this one went all in.  Perfect balance of sweetness and crisp texture.    Felt this little hidden gem had a lot to offer and hopefully more people give it a try.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! So fresh! Flavor! Passion! You must eat here, and fast! Truly a Vegas gem and your taste buds will be oh, so very thankful!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Expected the gyro to have more flavor and be WARMER. Really average food, and kind of spendy for the average quality."}
{"text":"Best kibbeh I have had in a long time... tender with the most flavor. I like whole or slivered pine nuts. There's were ground but who cares.  They we're delicious. The falafel was equally very well done."}
{"text":"Zero atmosphere,  yet friendly,  clean and a dozen or more vegetarian/vegan options. My falafel is absolutely delicious and the pita is freshly baked. ...I am taking a few home to make lunch sandwiches this week."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a good falafel anywhere...especially in the middle of the Mojave Desert! Lucky for us Amena exists to fulfill our deepest Middle Eastern food cravings.  I had a Falafel sandwich($6.49) which came stuffed with pickles and other assorted goodies. Ask for the hot sauce they have a squeeze bottle full of it along with tahini sauce for your sandwich. They have several tables to sit and eat here,as well as an awesome assortment of sweets. They make their own grape leaves and pita and lentil soup! Not to be missed!. Great place to grab a bite before shopping at Trader Joes!"}
{"text":"This family owned and operated restaurant/bakery is awesome!  Super friendly staff, the food is delicious and authentic, and the restaurant is cozy and casual.  We could have stayed and hung out and ate for hours.  Try the mint lemonade and hummus!"}
{"text":"This is the most delicious and awesome Palestinian  food in town and the service is so amazing!! Love this place and reminds me of home and the morning Turkish coffee  is breathtaking. Highly recommended if you are middle eastern and you need a taste of home !!   Great and thank you and keep the hard work."}
{"text":"Best shawarmas ever. Sauces are amazing, if you go at the right time they're not packed but either way, worth it. It's far from where I live but close to where I work and I get it as much as I can. They're friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is the best place if you want to experience homemade Mediterranean food. The service is great and we had the owner come check on us to make sure we were taken care of. The hummus with meat was my favorite. Make sure to try their lamb shops, they were so juicy and flavorful! We also bought some warm whole wheat Pita bread to take home."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas and couldn't leave without some falafel :)  I went to Amena because it got such amazing reviews! The woman at the front was incredibly hospitable!  We came on a Sunday night and practically had the place to ourselves -YAY!  I took a first-time-falafel-taster here.  I was very proud of him because he was very open to trying a vegetarian favorite of mine.  He ate 5 out of 8 falafel balls and killed the hummus, so it was a success!  The pita was so fresh!  We both adored the mint lemonade.  It was amazing and thank you so much for the refills!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say service and quality has declined. I ordered a sandwich and it was frozen pita and under cooked falafel. Sad to see this  decline in quality."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for falafel in Vegas. We come here often for falafel pita lunch sandos.   Being veggie they always make sure they clarify vegan and I really love it. No fuss, no hassle, they always double check.  The owner is from Nazareth and Jerusalem. They carry those fun Osem snacks and they even carry the organic tahini containers that my father in law insists on me buying.   Falafel: It's not the super yellow Israeli small balls, but it's not the super green (parsley filled) cheap way either. They are perfect. Slight crisp on the outside, no grit no fluff inside. They melt in your mouth somehow. Sooo yummy and filling!   From eggplant dishes, Turkish coffee, to baklava, to fries they have all the goodies. And it's all at a great price.   Baklava is very hard to find vegan (most of the time made with honey) so it's nice if you get the craving!   We usually get veggie combo with dolma and the falafel plate and it's usually too much food :)   They even offer regular or whole wheat pita and wow it's good and I don't even like bread!"}
{"text":"First time here after my craving for falafel wasn't faltering. I have to say, this place is AMAZING! The staff is beyond friendly and positive, the food is the BONUS! My husband and I will definitely be adding this to one of our go-to spots from now on. Thank you, Amena Bakery & Deli for your beautiful service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, this place is worth the visit for the wonderful home made Pita, Falafel and the BEST Hummus in town! They also have very fresh and authentic pastries which are all delicious. With so many cheap and \"fake\" middle eastern restaurants around, this one shines in it's authenticity, freshness and good quality. If you didn't grow up eating this sort of food, you have no idea how many restaurants are serving you cheap imitations of it. Amena is definitely not one of them. If you like middle eastern food, this place belongs on your frequent restaurant rotation. If you've never really experienced good middle eastern food, this is a great place to get acquainted with it. You'll be a fan for life!"}
{"text":"A new \"accidental\" discovery that is now a new favorite. Started off with a sampling of their cookies. All fresh, flavorful and deemed worthy to have again. Returned and am trying the hummus, katayef, and spanokita. All very yummy.  In a town that has tons of Mediterranean restaraunts, this is now my favorite."}
{"text":"The search has finally ended!  Since living in Vegas for the past 18 years I have been sorely disappointed in what some places consider to be a good falafel.   I have managed to find what I thought was impossible here at Amena.  A beautiful crispy outside, wonderful soft GREEN inside (green is good.... Really good when talking falafel) and amazing flavor falafel ball.    It is very similar in flavor to the ones I grew up with in San Jose at Falafels Drive In: http://www.yelp.com/biz/falafels-drive-in-san-jose  I ordered the Falafel plate.  It came with 7 large falafel balls, salad, hummus, a small thing of pickles, 1 pita and the necessary 2 sauces: A deliciously spicy pickled pepper chunky delicious concoction.  It also came with the delicious creamy white sauce you can put it on anything.  It was a wonderful lunch.  It really was perfect, save one thing:  It needed more than 1 pita.  The 1 pita provided was enough for either the hummus OR the falafel but not both.  However it was not enough of an issue to give less than 5 stars.  The service was also wonderfully attentive and helpful.  I will be back.  Hopefully to try something different."}
{"text":"After picking up the last items on our office supply/snack run, the girls and I were hungry and looking for a bite to eat.  We were looking for a salad or sandwich place but when the best recommendations we got were for Olive Garden or TGI Fridays, we decided to turn to Yelp.  Turns out, Amena was in the very same mini mall.  Awesome!  From the moment we walked in, we were in love.  So many delicious options!  We almost made the mistake of each ordering the veggie combo.  Luckily, the lady behind the counter stopped us.  The veggie combo is more than enough to share so we got the grape leaves and the mahi mahi as well.  I'm pretty sure the staff at Amena thinks we're big freaks.  I don't think we stopped talking about how great everything was the entire time we were in the place.  We loved that they brought out olives and pickled veggies to start, then the warm pita bread, then the veggie combo...you get the idea.  Everything was wonderful and so fresh.  You know when you can just taste the difference between something that was pre packaged and something hand made?  It's like that.  You can tell that everything is homemade with love.  After almost cleaning our plates, we were told that the mahi mahi would be out in a few minutes.  We were stuffed already but couldn't stop eating.  I'm so glad that we didn't stop there.  The fish was buttery, hot and perfectly cooked.  And it came with more hummus and pita bread.  We polished that off too.  Not only is the food wonderful, the people who work there are so gracious and genuine.  They took excellent care of us, which was unexpected for a deli.  The prices were also very reasonable.  The three of us could have easily split the veggie combo and the grape leaves and been perfectly happy.  I'm so glad we didn't miss out on that fish, though.  We walked out stuffed and raving about our new favorite lunch spot.  I'm just kicking myself that I didn't leave any room for dessert.  Oh well, I'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"Go here!  I have never had a bad meal here.  Not always known what exactly I was eating, but good is good in any language.  The plates are deceiving, you might think that it is small portions, but you will be satisfied.  You need to go here.  Every time I visit vegas, I make it a point to come here.  It is a must stop place.  The food is amazing, and the service is good.  The waitress is very helpful and informative."}
{"text":"One of the best restaraunt's in Las Vegas.  I always feel like every dish is prepared just for me.  Everything is fresh and done the long way, the chef doesn't take short cuts and every dish has the flavor to prove it. I love the staff who go out there way to make me feel at home,  Best Middle Eastern food outside of the Middle East! The lentil soup and the falafel are the best I have ever tasted and I get all the hot sauce I want!  After a resent trip, I feel like I should amend this review. When the owners or family are not there, the food is merely ok. The soup was watered down and the food was missing its punch. No lemon juice squeezed on top, no spices.  You need more reliable employees. That care about your business. The food was so bland, it made me not want to come back"}
{"text":"Went in there today with a friend and bought us both Mint Lemonades, I knew they were fantastic and insisted that my friend had to try one and of course YUMMY!  I wanted to try the food but it was close to dinner time so I have added it to my food bucket list instead and will be back asap!  Have been there before and they were amazing then too and they have since remodeled and had some awesome things for sale--Tahini, Honey, cookies, they also have a bakery/dessert section and a Vegan section which I dont see very often."}
{"text":"Great price, tasty food! Gyro & chicken. I literally came here 3 days straight to eat around the area. Big bang for your buck.   Located in Trader Joe's plaza. Grab some grub when you buy grocery."}
{"text":"Great humos, and flaffels and the kunafe is the best of had in the states so far. Small place the owners are super nice. A great arabic food place , they even make plates that are more than the usual sandwhichs and kabobs"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I'm surprised that I haven't written a review. The food here is incredibly delicious. All the food here is prepared fresh. The lula is one of my favorite dishes but I've tried a lot of whats on the menu and I was never disappointed. The desert that they have here is one of the best for Mediterranean desserts. Also the staff here are all friendly I guarantee you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had the combo plate and left full and very satisfied after trying a delicious baklava for desert. The Owner- Amer and his staff were very friendly and accommodating. It is an immaculately  clean place too! I look forward to going back there to eat the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I LOVE all the vegan options here. My favorite is the fava beans, hummus, falafel, and the mint lemonade. If you need a sweet treat, try the baklava! I'm never disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Truly delicious. Stopped in here for lunch with my wife. I had the vegetarian plate and she had the chicken shawarma. Both plates were amazing. service was quick and friendly. Everything tastes fresh and was well seasoned (not too heavy but flavorful). The homemade lemonade with mint was perfect with the meal. This place is a must to come back to."}
{"text":"Came by for the chicken shwarma plate, as recommended by our famous and fearless CM, Drew. I ordered takeout after visiting the bookstore next door, and it was a relatively short wait for my order: about 10 minutes.  Pricing was a little on the high side: got the chicken shwarma plate with two pitas and sides of cucumber salad and hummus ($12) plus a beef kibbeh ($2), bringing my with-tip total to around $15 for one for take out. A bit steep, but food was quality.  Came home to enjoy, and it was still piping hot, which was a good sign. Chicken was well seasoned and moist, pita was soft and warm and didn't harden as at other places. Hummus had a good consistency and texture and was not chalky but was somewhat bland. Cucumber salad was standard. Would consider getting it again. The kibbeh was a small fried ball of beef and onion for $2- probably a decent price for it but not worth getting, IMO. Didn't have much flavor and just didn't stand out at all.  Service while in store was good- they friendly and polite. They have a deli counter with various salads, a pastry case with desserts, and a few random grocery items scattered about without prices. To the bottom right of the menu, there's a specials board: the open face eggplant sandwich is new and sounds like it might be tasty. Will be keeping this place in mind next time I need lunch after the bookstore, or want a quick-fix to my shwarma cravings."}
{"text":"The dishes are very delicious and the service here is excellent! If you ever plan on vacationing in Las Vegas, I highly recommend going here. Whether you have an adventurous pallet or not, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was prepared fresh and the  shawarma and gyros were tender and flavorful. The grape leaves are the best I've ever had. However, the grilled chicken was rather dry but beautifully presented. The yoghurt is the best in town!! Make sure you order the fresh lemonade with mint, perfect for summer. Overall, homemade Mediterranean, so healthy!!"}
{"text":"By far best pita bread you will taste in this town. All of their meat plates are spectacular and the falafel is my personal favorite. Gyro meat will melt in your mouth. I highly suggest this to try."}
{"text":"Very cute spot. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helped me with my difficult order. She was patient and checked on us several time to be sure we had everything we needed. Customer service was excellent without seeming like they were imposing. Loved the hummus and I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm a falafel guy, first and foremost. This falafel, although crunchy outside was mushy and undercooked inside. Almost raw or uncooked. Maybe if they cooked it through it would be good. But I couldn't tell for sure. Place is clean, service is good and quick."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious with something for everyone - meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free...  I liked my grilled eggplant dish so much at the restaurant, that I had Amena cater a party a week later. I brought them my platters hoping they could arrange everything and look how stunning they we're!  And they were very professional, conscientious and communicative."}
{"text":"The mint lemonade was good enough, but add everything else in and you get some seriously good food experience. I'd say the lunch plate with a little of everything is a good start. From there, you can pick your favorites. You can also use this place as a bakery for an extra added bonus. Quite affordable for what you get.   The feel of the place is casual. It operates as a cafe for dining in. I haven't been here and not been able to get a seat.Not much to look at, but it does have some bakery goods for the enhanced smell.   While you're at it, you can visit Amber Unicorn Used books next door. It makes a great lunch stop. Books and Mediterranean food are a great combination."}
{"text":"The food here, for me, is \"5 Stars\". The service was a bit disorganized...only 3 tables of people eating when we were there, but the person serving the food got every order wrong. If you are patient though, you will get some great mideastern yumminess. The schwerma plates had enough for two meals. The standouts for us were the hummus...the creamiest I've ever had! The fresh lemonade with mint. (Drank 4 glasses!) Amena makes pita bread to die for. We also took home very large flatbreads that were like lavosh only moister. On another trip there I got some of their pastries and liked those too, though they weren't the best I've ever had (not enough filling). When I'm craving schwerma, hummus, or fresh pita in Las Vegas though, this is the place to go. (And it's not a very long taxi ride from the Strip, for you visitors.)"}
{"text":"I have to say I been here at least a hundred times. By far the best falafels I had. They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The hummus is smooth and fresh. The falafel plate is just under $10 and feeds two people easy. I recommend this place to anyone. Just amazing!!!"}
{"text":"IGreat food, portion is is just right, pita bread is soft and fresh. I had the combo and could not finish it. Next time I'll have to save room for some baklava!! Will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing place. We ordered facade beans and humus and falafel.  Oh my God never had it like that in my life.  Mint tea and deserts were amazing  Let's put it this way for the price it's really good meal. Vegetarian people this is your spot trust me. Don't let the location or the look deceive you. You won't regret it The young lady that served us is amazing polite and very informative. No matter what we asked her for she said no problem.  This is the customer service we didn't get in a 5 star Restaurant  I will go there again and again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after visiting Amber Unicorn Books next door & was immediately welcomed by the owner & a waitress. Very friendly, made suggestions based on what I like to eat, explained what was in the dishes, made conversation. The food was incredible! I am kicking myself for not coming here years ago. I love their selection. Great for all types of food preferences. Vegan options a plus! I got a sampler platter & the falafel was great, the hummus, babaghanoush, it was all fresh & just right."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best middle eastern experiences around. The pita is homemade (one of a kind) the food is to die for and the owner is awesome!   He also has a place duzar in Henderson... We will be trying that next!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is GREAT! The service was great! The food was great! My friend just got back from Saudi Arabia and he said that the food at Amena was very AUTHENTIC. I come to Vegas every year and I will definitely be coming back to Amena!"}
{"text":"after months of hearing how great this place is, we finally made it here. they close a bit early and we are typically late eaters so we never managed to get here early enough to try it out. we really should've made more of an effort though because amena is the real deal.  falafel, tabbouleh, hummus and pita are some of my most favorite foods. the falafel here is one of the best i've ever had. it was a little bit darker than i would normally prefer but i believe it was more of an oil issue than the falafel itself, which had great flavor and consistency. the tabbouleh was nice and refreshing with a tartness that i find lacking in most tabbouleh these days. the hummus was so smooth and delicious with a strong tahini flavor. the freshly made pita was soft, warm and chewy.  the star of the meal for me, though, was the lentil soup. i am a lover of soup and this lentil soup was absolutely fantastic! it was smooth and flavorful with a few chunky, hearty bites of lentil. the portion was enormous and it was served piping hot which was fantastic on a cold winter night.  the restaurant itself is sparse and deli-like. you order at the counter but pay after you eat. our server was a very kind young lady who checked up on us frequently and thanked us after each visit to our table. it's rare to find a dining establishment that appreciates your business to such a degree.  we really enjoyed our meal and it was very apparent when the hubby exclaimed \"why has it taken us so long to eat here?  this place is great!\""}
{"text":"Great food, great value!  The falafel pita is super delicious and a great value!  This is a nice deli-style restaurant, perfect for grabbing a quick lunch or just having a casual dinner with friends.   They also have pita, hummous and pastries available for dine-in or take out.  We got pita, hummous and baklava to go.  Everything was great! We will definitely be going back to Amena!"}
{"text":".thank you gil for recommending this place it was very good especially the fresh made bread .the kabob was good as was everything else in fact I will take a order of the bread and hummus to go .."}
{"text":"The mint lemonade is delicious. The fresh homemade pita is out of this world fresh and great flavor. Also, the hummus, rice and other side dishes are tasty. I thought the kabobs were over cooked to my liking. The price was moderately priced.."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I eat here about 1 time a week.  The food is always fresh, well presented, and satisfying.  They bake their own pita, which is always soft and fresh, and they even sell it by the bag, which always seems to draw customers.  I notice people come in all the time while I am eating and buy bags of pita.  I love their falafel and grape leaves.  The grape leaves are dense and tightly wrapped, and have a nice balanced flavor.  The combo plate is superb, which is a healthy amount of food for $16, and includes hummos, pita, salad, chicken, beef and falafel.  I love the great mix of flavors and the large portion.  Probably some of the best falafel and grape leaves I have ever had, and the other stuff is very good also.  I will say that I find their baklava too nut heavy, but other than that, I am hard pressed to complain.  The home make some mint lemonade too, which is super tasty, but you definitely need to enjoy mint.  Kind of like a non alcoholic mojito."}
{"text":"Everything is home made and extremely fresh(bread, desserts, sauces, hummus, pickles omg yummy). The owner brought us Turkish coffee and his home made dessert. Omg it will blow your mind! Best Turkish coffe and k√ºnefe Ive ever had in US and Im Turkish. If you want to experience a different cuisine along with friendly staff  who loves what they are doing this is your place"}
{"text":"Wow, Very good, well priced.  You can't go wrong, there's delicious middle eastern food and desert.  I love the pastries.  Try a Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty incredible food and friendly service. I love their pitas. The limeade is strong and good. Yes!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for another authentic Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas and finally... I found this place! I have been craving some authentic food since I had some of the best ones in DC!  Food: Veggie Platter- it came with falafels, hummus, baba ganoush and veggie salad stuff (forgot what they call it).. amazing! their hummus is so good with chick peas on the side. It came with fresh, warm pita and you can eat it however you want. I put the falafel and the toppings inside the pita to eat and it's sooo fresh, healthy and delicious!   Grape leaves- The grape leaves and rice came out warm and fresh! it was good.. tasted like every grape leaves rice dish.  Grilled chicken hummus platter- the grilled chicken was so juicy!!! I love how they grilled it and the flavors they put with it. It came with rice and hummus on the side.  Carrot juice- so refreshing!!!  The platter sizes are pretty reasonable. It's more than enough to get you full for the rest of the day! However, it is a bit pricey. Everything is between $10-25 per item. I have been to cheaper places, but I guess you can say you are paying for the quality. Will I be back? Of course but only when I want to splurge!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the GYRO plate.  It's times like these when I question the credibility of Yelp. I came here with a craving for a gyro and with the \"great\" reviews my hopes were high.    The short....I ordered a $14 gyro plate and got 2 large pitas with tasteless prepackaged gyro meat.  Prepackaged due to the uncanny symmetry of every piece of meat and the fact I didn't see a vertical roaster in the kitchen.  Come one yelpers....5 stars for a Greek place that doesn't even have a gyro roaster!!!  I'm sure other items on the menu are good, but look elsewhere for a good gyro."}
{"text":"Can I say that I love this place?   The owners are so nice.  You can tell that they love their business and their customers.  With that said, on to the food!  They use halal meat, which is important to some. (As I've Yelped halal in Vegas and haven't got any hits, I figured it should be noted.) On my next trip, I will check out the sandwiches, but this time around I had the combo plate and kibbeh balls.  Both were outstanding.  What I really loved was the hot sauce.  So tasty!  It reminds me of the flavor from Mamoun's in NYC but not quite as spicy.  It was love at first taste.    The Turkish coffee was good but not the same as I've had in Jersey.  It didn't really have the grounds in the bottom, and I was given sugar on the side instead of it being sweetened during preparation.  I kind of found that to be strange, but I'm no expert on Turkish coffee.  The baklava and fig cookies were outstanding.  This is by far the best restaurant of this genre I've been to in Vegas.  In fact, I think I just talked myself into going back today."}
{"text":"We went there to try shawarma. Also, we tried humus. We liked both of them, especially shawarma was delicious. They make pita bread themselves which is worth to try."}
{"text":"I would like to begin with a big thank you. What I ate today at this lovely little place was amazing and it put a smile on my face. Veggie/vegan platter. There was enough for me and my lovely companion. Let's not forget the great service."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for Israeli/ mediterranean food! The chicken shawarma and the falafel are amazing!!  I always end up buying goodies to take home, like their homemade humus, babaganoush and their homemade baked on the spot pita bread is to die for!! The owner is always there and is super nice. If I lived closer I would eat there much more often. Love, love this place! highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! My coworker and I stopped by on our lunch because we were craving Mediterranean food and were pleasantly surprised. The food was DELICIOUS and the staff was extremely kind and accommodating. We both will definitely be coming back...regularly! Be sure to order the grape leaves when you visit :)"}
{"text":"I been there few days ago the service is great the food is ok!i had a chicken shawarma plate i think the price are lil too much while i have been to better places with lower price!!!but yes i enjoyed my meal"}
{"text":"Amena is great! The ambiance is so relaxing that I could actually enjoy my meal. My friend asked about the chocolate quickers and they gave us 2 to try for free. They were so delicious, like a mix of chocolate cake and brownie mix but so soft and decadent."}
{"text":"The fresh-baked pita bread (regular or whole wheat) is outstanding - the best I've ever had.  The prepared salads etc are also very good."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern restaurant in Vegas [period]  Friendly and attentive staff, delicious food made fresh from scratch. Feel this is highly underrated /not as popular as it deserves to be due to the location."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a apparel show and me and my brother felt like having some nice kebob and shawarma..we searched online and found this place..its about 15 min drive from the covention center..so we visited this place and had beef shawarma and the taste totally blew us away..it was so tasty and juicy that I don't think I've ever had a shwarma like this before..this place is owned by AMER I guess who is a frndly guy and help you out to select. The perfect dish..he also offer free arabic desert sometimes..so the experince was preety amazing..I visit vegas 1 time a year and I hope to visit Amena deli again next year..its also Halaal Btw good for the muslim freinds."}
{"text":"Maybe the best Kibbeh I've ever had!!!  Definitely the best Pita.  I was disappointed in the Gyros meat but everything else we tried (and we may have eaten 2/3 of the menu) was awesome.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot off the Vegas main beat, great service and food was great! Had a mix plate with lamb and beef, falafel was great and so was the hummus and home made pita bread."}
{"text":"This place is amazing we love the food the people are so sweet the food is so fresh and it's homemade! Even the French fries taste homemade !! They have vegetarian choices and vegan as well which is amazing !! The meat is delicious as well I give this place a 10 star if I could !! That's how amazing it is !! Please try it"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food.  Every time I have been here, the service has been exceptionally friendly (Amer, the owner is awesome!) and always offering free tastes of whatever I haven't tried yet.  I've eaten their vegetarian plate (hummus, falafel, salad...) and their chicken shwarma.  I leave satisfied and without guilt - it's so healthy!"}
{"text":"Well the other reviews were right! The Hummus is outstanding!!I I had the sampler plate with chicken and beef schawarma, falafel, pita, hummus and salad and it was a lot of food. I took 1/2 home for later!! Very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Home away from home! I love hummus and happy I took an hour off the Vegas convention to visit this fridely restaurant and enjoy their amazing food and hospitality!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I always drive by Amena when I go for my groceries. Looked them up on Yelp and had to try it after reading their positive reviews. We were looking for something healthy that night and it filled the spot.   I loved their pickled sides and the salad was awesome. The chicken was seasoned well and their homemade pitas sold me; thick and fluffy. But what really sealed the deal was the baklava and mango drinks. The baklava was filled with a strong cinnamon flavor and light on the honey with crushed Pistachios on top; yummy! The Mango drink was light, iced and refreshing.  I wish the prices were a little lower, but it was a great visit with excelent customer service.  Thank you for the extra pitas!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the owner Amer is very friendly and eager to please, all his customers. The staff is very nice as well. It is very clean and the bathrooms are too. This is a family owned and operated business which is nice to see, and they are opening a second location in Henderson."}
{"text":"The best lunch I had all week was at Amena. I've been there quite a few times, and I've never been disappointed. I generally get the falafel since it's the best in town, but today I went for the kibbeah, babaganoush and hummas. When the owner saw that I was torn between the falafel and the kibbeah, he tossed in a couple of falafel for free! And i had the most wonderful fresh lemonade with crushed mint. Unbelieveably good. As always, the food was superior and the service was outstanding. Why eat corporate crap when something as wonderful as Amena exists?"}
{"text":"So after always reading the reviews to this bakery and deli I decided to try it last Sunday. Needless to say I was not disappointed! We ordered hummus and pita as well as grape leaves for the appetizer. I'm not a huge fan of grape leaves so I expected these giant cabbage looking rolls stuffed full of filling.it was funny how when they came out it was the complete opposite of what I was thinking. they delivered to my table small little rolls of joy stuffed with an amazing rice mixture that I won't forget! The hummus was absolutely amazing and the olive oil on top was top notch finishing oil. The pita bread was hot and gooey and warm and chewy and amazing!   We waited for our main meal which did take quite a long time.if I do have a complaint about this place it was the waiting time. But it was well worth the wait. My chicken sharwma   was absolutely divine the rice was perfect and they delivered a nice pickled mixture on the side.  They even had vegan options as well as vegetarian options for my son who has allergies! All in all the foods was amazing! Can't complain and I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"This is my #1 Favorite Restaurant in Las Vegas.  This place has the best falafel and the best pita I have ever had.  I've been a customer here for seven years. Even though I only visit Las Vegas four times a year, they always remember me and they treat me like a prince.  I don't even have to ask for the little bowl of pickled veggies.  They know how I roll.  The falafel sandwich here puts all others to shame.  It's absolutely perfect.  I do not believe there is, or maybe even could be, a better one.  It's the Platonic ideal of a falafel sandwich.  The falafel patties are unfailingly fresh, always fried to order. Perfectly crisp and packed with flavor.  I've never counted how many are in a sandwich, but there must be four or five.  There's falafel in every bite.    The pita bread here is pillowy soft, yet strong enough to hold a bunch of falafel and toppings.  Best pita I have ever had, no doubt about it.    I love how they construct the sandwich.  The split the pita and fill it with the falafel instead of using it like a taco shell.  The sandwich comes with lots of falafel and everything else you want, cucumbers, tomato, pickles, cabbage, tahini, hot sauce, and probably more.  It's loaded. It never fails to fill me up.  I savor each and every bite.  I notice as I get towards the end of the sandwich I start taking progressively smaller bites, because I don't want the sandwich to be over.  When I finish the sandwich I as happy as Mikey C gets.  Total satisfaction, every time.  After I'm finished eating they always ask me how I liked the sandwich.  They smile when I tell them how good everything was.  They chuckle just a bit when I insist that theirs is the best falafel and the best pita  in the whole damn world, because I go on an on about it.  They know I am one of their biggest fans.  Plus, they know what I'm saying is 100% true!  They have a lot of other stuff on the menu, and it all looks great.  There's just no way I will ever get a chance to try it because I'm all about the falafel.    Mike C says: falafel today, falafel tomorrow, falafel forever!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch at Amena.  Very good lunch spot.  Owner and his staff were very attentive and offered good recommendations on their menu.  Food was very good - particularly enjoyed the falafel, hummus, schwarma, pita, baklava and manoshet.  Falafel, hummus and pita were particularly notable - hummus was fresh, creamy, flavorful, falafel was freshly made, crispy on the outside, smooth and well seasoned inside.  Atmosphere was simple and unassuming - very comfortable, nice little market/cafe atmosphere one commonly sees in mediterranean style restaurants.  Recommended lunch option in the center of town - again, very good food and very friendly and helpful owner and staff.  Another local business that deserves support based on quality and service."}
{"text":"I have to say hands down the best baklava I've tried in the U.S. Since being in the Middle East since 2010 I've been on the hunt for decent Mediterranean food and this place hits the spot.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and it was great! Loved the homemade hummus. The only thing was the price. Total was $16 and that was just for me but if you want great healthy food then you gotta pay for it.  The baklava was moist and not too sweet. Still flakey and delish! It was great.. Everybody has to try their baklava at least once."}
{"text":"Best Baklava ! I ordered the vegetarian combo, fresh healthy deliciousness in every bite. Tabouleh, baba ganoush, hummos, falafel & salad. The falafel was heaven, light as a feather and crunchy on the outside. I should have stopped half way through but it was too good. My husband got the lamb plate, it was good, nicely spiced. The portions are big and very filling... We ordered 2 katayef to take home, wished we'd saved room ! They were made to order came out piping hot and delicious but we were too full. We ordered a cheese and a walnut, such goodness, I could only think how these must taste piping hot !  I would go back just for a piping hot katayef !"}
{"text":"Everybody hear is so nice ! Just moved here and will definitely be coming back! So yummy AND healthy"}
{"text":"Had the combo plate... Huge amount of food and everything on it was incredible! Homemade pita bread is outta sight! Will be making this place my go to for Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"What a find!   We rolled into town from Moab, Utah today and headed to Trader Joe's. for some groceries.  A couple of doors down, we found Amena.  We arrived around 3 pm for dinner. Amer, the owner, was extraordinarily nice. He offered us suggestions and even some free tastes. We ordered hummus, baba ganush, tabuli, and falafel plates, chips (french fries),  and a separate chicken shwarma sandwich. Everything was freshly made - I mean really just made for us. This was some of the best middle east food I've eaten in the US.  The pita was incredibly soft and moist - it was just baked earlier in the morning. The baba was smoky with some chunks of eggplant and garnished with mint. The hummus was smooth and creamy with 4 falafel added on top (we didn't know the plate came with these). The falafel was very crispy, but not over fried. The interior of it was very green, indicating Amer used lots of parsley and cilantro.   For desert, Amer suggested his homemade Kunaffe - filo, honey, sweet goat cheese topped with pistachios. Wow!  You come here obviously for the food, not the table settings. Most of the food came on ceramic plates, but a few dishes came on paper plates. Silverware was not plastic. Basically, you order at the counter, sit and the food is brought to you. That was just fine by us.  At first the prices seemed a big high, but once we had a chance to eat the food, the quality far surpassed anything that would be priced less. Here you clearly get tremendous value for what you are paying for. Especially, since all the food was freshly prepared for us - nothing was prepped waiting to be added to our dishes.   Amer is an outstanding value. If you are looking for incredible middle eastern food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Found this little gem by accident and are we happy we did!   People very friendly and the food was fabulous Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I've got two words for you: Baba Ganoush. Amena knows how to do this dip WELL. SMOKEY DELICIOUS CREAMY, All the things it needs to be. Besides the baba ganoush, the tabouli and salad were excellent. The falafel is good. Their freshly baked pita bread (in-house) are like little pillows of joy, SOOOO GOOOOOD. definitely give this spot a try. The interior is a little piece of Nazareth. Amena will not disappoint. Oh, and mint lemonade! Cheers!"}
{"text":"this place has gone down since the owners are no longer involved as much! We have been going here for over 3 years and food was used to be fresh, tasty, and service was excellent. Well we went there December 7, 2014 and not only the service we received was horrible. We ordered a plate that showed it had sunny side up eggs in it. so i asked can you be sure the eggs are in fact sunny side up and soft and she said sure. When i got the plate the eggs were scrambled and mixed in with the rest of the stuff on the plate when I complained she gave me an attitude and even at first said we have no money back policy??? but then she refunded us for that plate.  But that's not it... before they used to use fresh lemon juice for their tabouleh sauce so it tasted really good, they use something bottled now so it tastes acidic and really not good anymore, i ordered a Turkish coffee and everyone knows Turkish coffee is served very much the size of an espresso. They brought it in a beer glass and i am looking at it in disbelief thinking these people don't know what Turkish coffee is, anyone drinking that much of a strong coffee will get a heart attack! So no more business from us....  I should give them no stars really."}
{"text":"Honest review here! I've been here quite a few times and the food is AWESOME! It truly has never disappointed. There falafels and hummus are just so gosh darn good. Call me nit-picky, but the reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5 is this, every time i have come here i have sat down to eat. Always asking for a glass of water and I'm telling you it's never been so difficult to get a refill of water in my life. They are super nice but aren't all too attentive. They basically get your food with a smile and forget the rest. The last time i was there, i went with my sister and the roasted eggplant took a good 20+ min at least. No problem, we were having a nice time chatting and they did give us some really awesome rice dish and omg a mint lemonade that was all too good. Long story short, awesome food, eh service, nice people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas.   Falafel, chicken, mint lemonade, tabouleh all amazing.   Food is quality and fresh."}
{"text":"The food is amazingly fresh and tasty!!! You must try it and the owner Amir is friendly and helpful with food recommendations. They really do cook with love!!"}
{"text":"Went to TJ's hungry and instead of picking up some of their prepared food to eat (E Coli outbreak) I decided to check this spot out. At first, the word 'Deli' had me excited for a sammie, but as I got closer I saw other signs for 'Shawarma' & 'Falafel'. Holy excitement. The place itself isn't much with just a few tables strewn about. One side has freshly made pitas lined up on a table and a case serving baked goods. The other side was the 'deli' section serving all sorts of Mediterranean delights. Beef, chicken, lamb shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, homemade hummus, etc..    I scooped up a chicken shawarma plate ($11.99) which came with sides of hummus, a small salad and two pitas. There was certainly a good amount of food for the price and I walked away full. The salad was OK, typical Israeli style with lots of cukes. The chicken was moist, sliced nicely and had that wonderful  shawarma spice to it. The only knock is that it was wayyyyy over salted. Highlight of the dish was the hummus. . Shawarma, earmuffs!.... I knocked back two fantastic pitas in that hummus. So good.  Def stop by if you dig the Mediterranean meats vibe."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Falafel was yummy :)  Super pleasant service-- they wanted to be sure we were happy with our food.  The fresh lemonade has LOTS of fresh mint in it... way too much for me. Baklava was good though :)"}
{"text":"We're visiting from out of town and needed a vegan friendly place. My boyfriend and I split the manakesh cheese and lentil soup and it was AMAZING. We weren't that hungry but I could easily have eaten more, everyone in our groups' food looked good. The service was so friendly and attentive, they even gave us cucumber lemonade! Definitely coming back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm rarely on this side of town, but if I am, there is nothing keeping me from coming here and indulging in my gluttonous ways. I've only been here a couple times and each time I am always greeted and treated so nicely. The young lady that is always running around there is so generous and thoughtful. She will go above and beyond to make your experience very satisfying.      Now for the food! I tend to get the combo plates so I can taste more of a variety. The meat combo plate has chicken, beef (can add lamb for an added expense), falafel, hummus (any kind you want to try) and a side salad. The veggie combo comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbuleh ( not sure what's in it, but it's delicious) and falafel. Their meats are so perfectly seasoned, their hummus is flawless in my eyes and their falafel are so moist. I think it would be very hard for this restaurant to disappoint. I also love to order their homemade mint lemonade. The freshest I've had in a while! When I was done, the waitress brought out more and told me there was some left over that she didn't want to throw out.     Now to the desserts! Baklava is Baklava. I don't have much of an opinion on it other than it being rather good, but the kunaffe! That is where the money's at. It reminds me of a birds best pastry I once tried. It can have cheese or walnuts in it. They might be of a higher price, but very big portions. If you have my tried this place and you like middle eastern food. I recommend putting on your shoes, getting in your car now and come try this amazing and delightful little restaurant. The end."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great price. Try the dessert"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town Hummus wow amazing and the bread is something else I do highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean food, definitely worthy of a 5 stars!! I came in to find a place for a nice sit down lunch. At around 8.00$ a plate their prices are very good, and the service is on point. The quality of the food supercedes the price. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great Mediterranean food experience!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick dinner and instantly fell in love with this place. Fresh bakes pita and desserts are for sale and the girl working the counter was polite and helpful. My friend and I ordered the Combo Special and Tabbouleh salad which was plenty for the both of us. Everything was DELICIOUS! The falafel was the best I have had in Vegas, the meat was amazingly seasoned, the hummus was perfect, the whole wheat pita soft and fresh, and the side sauces were perfectly complimentary. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!! Hiding in a shopping plaza with Trader Joe's, Amena is a welcoming place with delicious healthy options. Came in with my two brothers and bf and were helped immediately. We got the homemade lemonades, by the way come with mint and shaved ice and are well worth the wait! I ordered the gyro lamb sandwich, which I assumed came with the salad. Oops, I was wrong. But noticing that I was disappointed, in the fact my bf was thoroughly enjoying his salad, a man I assume was the owner, came up an explained how it wasn't part of the sandwich, but if for this time only if like to get one, on the house. Surprised, I said yes and enjoyed one the best little salads I have in awhile, I definitely would buy their salad dressing if they sold it. 10/10 would come again, and definitely get the plate lol."}
{"text":"I read an article about Strip chefs' favorite off-Strip restaurants and this was one of them. I can see why. It's definitely a hidden gem. Their homemade pita and hummus are amazing, and the space is really clean and bright. Try the chicken shawarma pita and definitely get a mint lemonade."}
{"text":"Late Lunch after Mani/Pedi: Turkish Coffee Beef Shawama Sandwich (Humus OTS) Homemade Mint Lemonade  Yes, yes and yes! Will return for sweets."}
{"text":"After many underwhelming food experiences in Vegas, this was like an oasis! We were grabbing a few things at Trader Joe's and I looked for coffee. Man, am I glad I did! Now, my Mama's best friend was Armenian and her husband was Lebanese. We are a lot of tabbouleh, lamb, kibbeh, growing up. So this is so comforting to me. This place is immaculate.  A lovely young lady helped me pick a few things to go. I also ordered two Turkish coffees, which were amazing. I am a cream lover all the way, but this coffee is so smooth and rich you don't even care that there isn't any cream for miles.  I ordered a small tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves, and when I saw the bags of freshly baked pita, oh yeah. It is so soft and has the best little chew to it. Then my hubby arrives and we ordered a gyro to go, and all the way! It came loaded with veggies and was easily the best one I have ever eaten. And have I eaten a few in my time.  She gave me a few little containers of sauce. One was tahini, and was smooth and buttery. I dipped my pita in there and savoured every bite with my tabbouleh.  The other was this gorgeous dark red hot sauce. It was thick and chunky and sent the gyro over the moon.  My hubby was in hog heaven. He vowed we will never eat anywhere else in Vegas. This whole meal with two Turkish coffees was about $30. A steal for the amazingness and high quality of food you get.   One thing that touched my heart was that they had a sign that said they would provide a box to put your leftovers in for a homeless person. I always want to do that!"}
{"text":"Wow omg, there food is amazing. This hole in the wall bakery is worth the find. Just amazing food; I had their sampler plate with 2 pieces of bread and salad. There food is on point, normally I don't care for Mediterranean food as it's not spicy enough for my liking but their chicken and beef is just the right combo of spicy and sweet. Great Tahini sauce not water and a nice consistent spread. A must eat place and it's right next to traders joe!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place daily and decided to finally give it a try. I picked up the beef shwarwama and I don't think it was worth the nearly $10 it costs. The meat was mediocre and rather bland. Everything is pretty pricey, but I think for \"Mom and Pop\" places, that's expected."}
{"text":"I am so upset right now that I can barely write this.   Being a loyal customer since day one and recommending Amena to both family and friends I thought my business meant something to the owner. I, at the very least, thought that my loyalty would buy me honesty. I was wrong.   A couple of hours ago I went into Amena to get some tabbouleh. Rosie prepared it. When I got home and tasted it, it was FANTASTIC!!! It was so good that I decided to go back and get another batch.   The owner was there and when I told him how good that Rosie made it, he told me that everyone makes it exactly the same. I replied that it was not exactly true. I've had it many times when it had way to much lemon, to little of this or to much of that. However, Rosie's was perfect and I asked him to please let her make it for me. He agreed. I went around the corner to see it being made and to my disappointment and surprise, he was making it. I told him that I wanted to try it before I paid $12.00 for a large. Sure enough it was loaded with lemon and I told him so. He said he'd retry. Second attempt; just as bad.   He justified his lie by saying that Rosie was preparing another customer's dinner. I informed him that since I made a special trip to get more of Rosie's tabbouleh I would have been more than happy to wait for her to finish with her customers.   Let's break this down. Over arrogance and dishonesty the owner lost a loyal customer that has been patronizing and recommending Amena to many, many people since literally day one. That's the definition of stupidity. I'm also posting this on Yelp and any other review sites that I can.   I'll now give all of my business to Afandi on West Charleston. It's closer to my house anyway."}
{"text":"After working several days of EDC festival and several more to go we finally were able to eat a meal. We were stopping by trader joes to stock up on some snacks when we found this gem glowing in the desert wasteland. The falafel was so moist and delicious. The pita was soft and supple like a freshly fallen snow. Baba Ghanoush was smokey and perfect! Do yourself a favor and eat here. It's delightful and the people are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for guiding us to this wonderful place.  Wife and I were greeted by Rowan (sp) and we mentioned that it's our first time here.  We just wanted to eat from their vegan menu and she told us about their vegan platter and the popular falafel sandwich.  We ordered both and as we were ordering, we hear \"chop chop chop\".  I just love hearing veggies being freshly prepped.  The food arrived in good time and wow...the plating was a piece of art.  The flavors from the platter were all fresh and well balanced.  Now, for the falafel sandwich AKA Best sandwich ever!  Its the real deal and we just crushed it.  The prices are very good for the quality as well.  After we finally stopped stuffing our face, Amer, the owner, introduced himself and asked us how everything was.  He was very pleasant to speak with and gave us some vegan baklava AND their famous mint lemonade on the house.  It was tough putting anymore food or drink in our bodies but we were not going to be rude and refuse.  Needless to say, they were both phenomenal.  We picked up some pita bread, falafel and hummus for later.  We were also advised on how to store the bread since it does NOT contain the preservatives/poison that most bread does these days. Thank you Rowan!  We will definitely be going back!  Thank you for making our first time there a great experience and for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"I came here in September. I had a pick-up order and I stayed for about a half hour talking to the owner (Amer) and a young woman behind the counter (I never got her name). They were both extremely friendly, helpful, and hilarious.  I was given some samples to nom on: * Amazing coconut covered chocolate ball - not too sweet and a great texture. Addictive. They should be called crack balls. * Baklava - one of the best I've had. * Homemade lemonade - minty and refreshing, and not too sweet. Delicious.  I took home a chicken shawarma plate, gyro plate, lentil rice, lentil soup, homemade pita, and a lemonade.  The plates came with a little side salad and hummus. The salad was fresh and had what tasted like an italian dressing on it. The hummus was good but there was something missing - it could use more cumin and/or garlic.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the shawarma plate because the seasonings didn't stand out to me and the chicken was a bit dry. The gyro plate made up for it though, since that beast was very flavorful.  The lentil soup was tasty and nicely seasoned (salty soups are the bane of my existence) but the texture was off for me - it was as if the soup was made of lentil powder and was \"scratchy\". My fianc√© loved it, however. Go figure.  The lentil rice was delicious. I love lentils and I love rice, so when you throw them together, it can't help but be delicious.  Overall, great little hole-in-the-wall, fantastic ownership and customer service, and good food."}
{"text":"Hands down best pita bread I've ever had , you can just eat it by itself so delicious ! Katiaf are very good , service  is friendly ... Many vegan / vegetarian options :)"}
{"text":"The entire vegetarian spread I had was amazing. My favorite thing was the wrapped stuffed grape leaves, tabbouleh and the lentil soup was very good. This is not too far from home, I'll be sure to try new things next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did but something just wasn't right.  Like Carly A. said \"An it's an o.k. bakery but not a five star lunch spot.\"  The owners were overly friendly, but the presentation and organization left much to be desired.  Upon entering there was this loud middle eastern music playing, and I couldn't hear what the waitress was saying.  I ordered the Amena salad w/ chicken.  When the salad came out there was no chicken on it, I asked the waitress and she said it doesn't come w/ chicken on it.  Why didn't she tell me that when I ordered?  I also ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich, which was o.k. but a little sloppy and too much cumin or turmeric in it.  It was a little expensive for my taste...$20 for a sandwich and salad, which took too long to make and wasn't that good.  The ingredients were fresh and the pita bread and hummus were yummy, but  dealing w/ the loud music, the wait, the misunderstanding w/ the order and the overpriced lunch did not make for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Dang! I wanted to be the first to write a review and TWO people beat me to it! This place has great, fresh, healthy food! They day I went, they'd only been open for 4 days and they were a little discombobulated. Serving spoons were nowhere to be found, so the folks working there were trying to use tiny plastic spoons to fill big heaping containers. Their cash register was broken too.  But from my first taste of baklava, nothing else mattered but the food. The baklava is luscious. It's some of the best I've ever had. It's not gloopy and not cloyingly sweet. The taste of nuts and honey and flakey pastry all come through.  Then I tried their veggie soup. It was nothing fancy, but somehow heart-warming soul food in soup form.   The Manoshet White Cheese pita/pizza like thing (fiteer for those who know the language) was outstanding. The pitas are fresh baked every day using organic flour. I could eat the Manoshet 3x/day and it would be a long time before I'd tire of it.  The Nazarene Salad was a standout. Cabbage, carrots, sesame seeds and bell pepper in a tasty homemade dressing.   I do want to suggest they add a combo plate of salads but as friendly as these folks are, I bet they'd make one just for you even if it isn't on the menu.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the atmosphere. I'm not so inclined to eat in and much more inclined to get take out. But the food is some of the best to be found in Vegas."}
{"text":"So yummy!  My husband and I were searching for a quick lunch before grocery shopping (never go to Trader Joe's on an empty stomach) and lucky for us, we found Amena right in the same shopping center!  I just moved to Vegas and have been eager to find a pita place to rival my beloved Naf Naf back in Illinois and Amena comes pretty close! The service was so friendly (we even got a complimentary piece of baklava as our dessert) and the food is delicious. We shared a plate of falafel and hummus with fava beans and it was really delicious. The falafels are perfect- crispy and crunchy on the outside, soft and delicious inside, and the hummus is sooo smooth and creamy! I You can also buy the pita to take home, like we did (6 for $2.29, and wayyy better than store-bought pita!). I can't wait to go back to try the shwarma."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to try out.  I especially recommend the mushroom hummus: mushrroms and onions sauteed in olive oil, served over a plate of hummus. A delicious and satisfying snack.  The falafel was very tasty, though I think it was frozen.  At any rate, I would order it again.  We had the combo plate which included falafel, beef shawarma and chicken shawarma.  I was not impressed by the meat dishes. I didn't find them to be very flavorful.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a vegan meal.  Maybe a spot of hummus to get you through the day.    Be mindful that this is a very casual deli. Great for lunch. A good place to drop in if you are driving in the neighborhood.  Sadly, I did not try any of the baked goods.  After gorging myself on hummus, I didn't have any room left for dessert."}
{"text":"How do you even write a review for a place as great as Amena?  Like...really?  We had been s l o g g i n g our way down the strip just fantasizing about something good to eat, something real and comforting and delicious.  We were calling places, dipping into and out of casino parking lots, on and off the freeway.  It was misery.  We pulled off Decatur - into this big and mostly vacant parking lot.  And there it was.  AMENA! When we walked in it was quiet.  We were exhausted, hungry, basically two depleted humans in need of sustenance, and not just food.  Somehow I knew the food would be delicious.  I know Greek.  I know Lebanese, Persian, and the like.  I love Mediterranean food.  We ordered falafel, gyro, grape leaves, some hummus...a bunch of little things arrived.  We were TAKEN CARE OF by our waitress/hostess/server who was so kind and generous and informative.  We were TAKEN CARE OF by Amer, the owner, who shared his passion for food and even a couple desserts on the house.  I was humbled, honestly, at the beauty of the food and the warmth of the proprietors.  Everything was fresh, everything warm and bright and deeply satisfying and nuanced and delicious.  This place is NOT TO BE MISSED if you're in Vegas for even one day.  AMENA is to be at the TOP OF YOUR LIST if you need catering.  I believe Amer, the owner, said he is from Nazareth.  THAT is cool.  All the food, without question, comes redolent with history and tradition - I know that much.  This place is SO BEAUTIFUL!  It's a nice little deli in a kind-of strange location, but easy to get to and worth returning to frequently.  It's that good.  Bring people.  Tell people.  Eat and enjoy life at Amena.  That's what we did.    #supersatisfying"}
{"text":"Just traveling through Vegas for the week and we were looking for someplace inexpensive yet good for dinner before we headed out of town. The cashier at Trader Joe's recommended this place so we dropped in. At first glance, it appeared to be your typical falafel joint. But as we perished the menu, we were impressed with some of the options, like shakshuka, the dinner plate specials, and their vegetarian/vegan/and gluten free options. The cashier was more than accommodating, friendly, and helped to make sure we got things that would make us happy. My friends had the chicken shawarma, which they both said they loved. One of them substituted her pita for veggies, and they were kind enough to give her those plus extra salad. I ordered the open face stuffed eggplant, which is grilled and skinned and then topped with abundant fresh vegetables and spicy tzakiki sauce. Wow. It was simply, simply fabulous. They even gave me extra humans and pita for protein. Their pitas were soft and felt homemade, and their hummus was so, so smooth and tasted great. If not homemade, at least it was infinitely better than your standard hummus fare. They also started us with house pickled vegetables and olives (you'll be happy if you like that stuff), and gave us complimentary bites of balaclava for dessert. I highly recommend checking this place out. If I lived here this would go in my regular rotation. 100% happy. And I can't say enough about the friendly service."}
{"text":"Fabulous food ... nice people ... incredible desserts !!!! The chicken shawarma sandwich was fantastic and the hummus was perfect !!!"}
{"text":"Very few Lebanese choices in Las Vegas, Amena bakery and deli is the place to go! The homemade food is phenomenal. The kibbe is as good as I've had anywhere, and food is always fresh and well prepared. Service can be a little slow, but I put that down to the effort and care that goes into preparing each dish."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and I've definitely become a fan!  We got some kinda flatbread with cheese to start which was good, we also ordered the homemade lemonade that I really enjoyed because the owner Amir blends mint into the lemonade which totally tasted like a mojito without the alcohol. we also ordered the combo plate(Falafel, Hummus, Beef Shawerma, Chicken Shawerma, and a side salad)   We also shared the Shnetzel Plate which came with fries and a side salad  We definitely enjoyed the Falafel, Pita, Hummus, and salad, but the Beef and Chicken Shawerma were kinda dry and not like other shawerma I've enjoyed before. Unfortunately for the Shnetzel.....dry too. Their sweets were pretty good and we bought more pita and falafel mix to cook up at home.  We'll be back, but  probably just to stock up on more falafel and pita...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner.  We had the combo special and chicken shawarma.  Everything was so good.  Hummus was smooth and delicious and meat tender.  We got pitas, labne, and baklava to go.  All very good.  Great service and will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best little Greek establishment in Las vegas!  My husband and I have purchased their homemade pita bread for over 5 years.  They have the best pits breads in town! Or that I have ever tasted anywhere. They make them fresh and they go fast . He can also hold some aside for you if you call ahead. Today we picked up his fresh made feta cheese and it is just amazing. We also tried a few of the freshly.prepared cookies and the date nut ones were still warm. The cookies are all delicious. Their hummus and other menu items are just perfect as well. I highly recommend this place. Also the owner is very nice and remember's my husband each time he comes in."}
{"text":"If you are one of the poor souls who has suffered from the likes of Chobani or Fage Greek yogurts, now is the time to treat yourself to the real deal: Labneh. It is rich and creamy, so you will eat less and feel more satisfied. Amena's Labneh is less bitter than Greek yogurt available in grocery stores. So I pick up a tub of it along with fresh hummus or tabouli or baba ghanoush as part of my regular shopping routine after leaving Trader Joe's.   Amena also serves a delicious and abundant Falafel plate that would feed me for two to three days--the plate is a healthy, fulfilling lunch or dinner.   The date pasties are handmade by mom. And so even though I don't like dates (or pastries, really), I had to try them and thought, \"Oh, these were the inspiration for the Fig Newton.\" They're worth trying.  The pita bread is exceptional. Overall, high quality foods, reasonable prices, nice people, great service. Amena caters, too."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a craving for shawarma and was served amazing beef shawarma, great falafels, and the best baklava I've ever had by the extremely friendly owner. I'll definitely be coming back for more! I regret not buying some of the baklava to go, but that gives me something to look forward to next time."}
{"text":"Very personable and friendly staff, good prices, and EXCELLENT food. I am a bit of a falafel/Mediterranean snob and this place exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"Very good service but the food is better!  All made from scratch.  Will be back very soon.  Portions are large."}
{"text":"Cute place! Food is decent.   Recently came here for lunch with a coworker at the recommendation of a friend who lives in the area. We ordered the beef shwarma sandwich $9 and the lamb shwarma plate with half hummus and half yogurt $12. The service was quick and friendly. The food was mediocre, lamb meat was well marinated but the quality is questionable, especially very chewy and dry. The pita was cold. We also ordered baklava for dessert and it was rather stale.   I have traveled to the Mediterranean many times and ate alot of food out there, this place just doesn't compare. Parking is very easy."}
{"text":"GREAT customer service.  Maria at the counter really sets the bar. Very friendly and accommodating.   Mint lemonade- So refreshing, a must (5 stars)  lentil soup- Delish, perfectly seasoned (5 stars)  Falafel- BEST IN TOWN ( 5 stars )   kunaffe with cheese- a little too sweet for me at first, but the butter and cheese cut through it the more you chew. (4 stars)    Kibbeh- My husband says Some of the best he's had (5 stars)  I wasn't too impressed with the combo platter/hummos but with everything else being so delicious, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't be very detailed because our experience here was insanely quick. I wanted something to bring to my co-workers that I knew they would enjoy. I picked up six almond cookies and two triangles of baklava. This was strictly for the bakery, and not for the actual restaurant.   Walking in, the environment is very quaint and the shelves are stocked with visually attractive ingredients and spices. The whole place is very cute, and the service was wonderful. The woman was very nice while extremely quick to greet us and assist on what we needed. The displays were admittedly somewhat bare in the bakery portion, but the cookies were in massive quantities, beckoning me to wonder how old they were. Still, everything did actually look decently fresh. The smell was also there.   The almond cookies were good. The filling was very tasty, and the exterior was crunchy enough. I was hoping for something a little more buttery, but they did taste authentic (old memories of a very good friend with a talent meant for the kitchen). However, one of my co-workers bit into one and complained that it tasted like lotion. I asked if it was the almond extract she may have been tasting, but she insisted it was scented moisturizer. A second tried it and confirmed, but these things do tend to happen and we often are unable to keep track of everything. Better than a hair or bug, if you ask me.  The baklava was good. It was pleasantly flaky, but a little too sweet; somewhat overwhelmingly. The interior consisted of nuts and honey, which is almost always a delectable combination. If eaten in smaller portions, they work out great. I definitely liked it.   Overall this place was good. Again, this is a rating meant only for the bakery section. I do intend to return and try their actual meals out, plus their deli. The prices are a little high. The baklava was anticipated, but it was over a dollar for each cookie (a somewhat small and round cookie). Still, I wouldn't know how the food is yet. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the first day they opened. The food is fantastic. They have the best pita bread in town. Oh and those cocoa balls with coconut are addictive.  The owner is cool and used to be there all the time, made sure everyone was happy and taken care of, now there is a girl in the front and sometimes she has a bad attitude. It's kind of awkward at times."}
{"text":"Wow loved the food. Great service that was attentive and friendly. The food had great flavor and we were impressed plus the bakery was fabulous"}
{"text":"So good!  We got the combo with the Chicken and Beef Shawarma, falafel, and hummus, which came with freshly-made pita bread.  We also got the Amena Salad and Baklava.  Everything there was made fresh, the restaurant/store is family-owned, and everything was delicious.  We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hummus is super creamy (not good ) service is super slow.... not coming back here. The we ordered to dishes and they came like 20 min apart"}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of the menu. The quality of food is very good considering at the prices for what they are. I like this place as I have not been disappointed yet in any of the dishes, although people seem to love the lemonades but they are not really my thing. The Greek salad it pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Their falafels and Hummus were really good.  Made right there.  Really gives you that home made freshness!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite in Vegas ! I love there salad it is delicious and so is the lemonade ! I try to go back atleast once a month !"}
{"text":"Great place... The food was super great... We easily dropped 50.00 in this place... We didn't regret it!!! The girl at in the front was very accommodating and made us feel like regulars! We're only in town for one more week but we will be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better on a summer day then some fresh Mediterranean/ Greek Food.  I was going to Trader Joe's and happened to see Amena in the corner of my eye so i quickly looked it up on yelp on my Iphone and say it got good reviews.  Went inside and was happy how to see it is almost a deli set up with a little bit of table service. I had the Amena Salad $7.49 which had Mixed lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Red onions, Feta Cheese, Walnuts and black olives with what i think was a herb vinaigrette. It hit the spot and was nicely balanced but kinda hard to eat with everything being small diced.  Since i was hard torn between the salad and Falafel sandwich the cashier/ server/ busboy/ possible owner gave me three falafels and a pita bread for free. The pita bread as Misti Y. sayes is AYUMYUMYUMYUM. taste like it was made minutes before it was brought out. and the falafel was very good. Crispy on the out side and soft on the inside with a great balance of herbs and spices.  I would defiantly recommenced this place for a nice relaxed lunch. I will come back again."}
{"text":"What a little culinary gem ! Delicious authentic middle eastern food with a home cooked flair. The best I've ever had in Las Vegas. Amer is a delight! Cordial & gracious, I felt the true middle eastern hospitality. Everything we had was amazing! We tried the lamb sharwma and falafel which was excellent. The sauces, fresh baked pita and delicious pickles veggies complimented both dishes perfectly. Amer brought us samples of there lentil & veggie soups which we loved, full of flavor & nutritious veggies. Last but not least we indulged in the Baklava, wow!!! Again can't say enough about this family owned business...highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in town! The lamb is great, the chicken is wonderful, the juices are fresh and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I love the spices in the meat and the excellent hummus. They make an excellent hot sauce that goes great with everything. The fresh lemonade is just that and terribly refreshing. I love it!"}
{"text":"I found Amena thanks to Yelp -- again - (Poly A, your review was terrific and convinced me particularly when comparing your notes on Habib's, that I should give them a shot).   So this Easter Sunday, when I realized I'd not ordered items for a party the next day, I remembered reading the review and headed over -- they were open -- Habib's wasn't.    I explained my situation to Amir -- what a great guy.  He and his niece were thoughtful and caring -- beyond generous.  I think they offered me samples of everything in the place.  And even offered to make items I needed that were not on their menu.   I arranged for pick up the next day at 2:00 (meat, cheese and spinach pies, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, tahini, pita bread, baklava, these round phyllo cookies that were crispy, sticky, sweet and cinnamony and just incredible, as well as little chocolate \"quickers\").     My staff had made lots of the items we served at the Persian-themed party, but there were some things that were just too hard for them to pull off -- hence the outsourcing.  I've not had tremendous luck finding good reliable sources since we've come to Vegas -- but these folks are the real deal.    And sure enough, yesterday at 2:00 sharp -- they were ready, and proud -- even found Persian music for me to use at the party!  Everything was delicious -- truly spectacular and reasonably priced.  Bless the Chef's heart -- he looked exhausted, too.  I know my order was a tall one.    I did learn one thing that I thought was interesting that Poly hadn't mentioned -- the family is from Nazareth.  Amir used to be a local bank branch manager.    Anyone looking for a great lunch -- terrific falafel sandwiches, kebobs, etc -- like Poly said -- on freshly baked pita is in for a treat.  It's also a great spot for a dessert -- or to use them for takeout -- but probably best to get to know them and order in advance.     The shelves do seem a bit bare -- but trust me, engage the owner or the girls in a conversation -- ask him what he likes -- their food couldn't be fresher, or their hearts any bigger -- and when I see a family working this hard in this business with such passion, I can't help but want to spread the word..."}
{"text":"Took A lunch break and order a Shawarma plate, well it's not my first time coming here and always the food is fresh and taste so good.  As well you don't have to wait so long for the food to come out.  I recommend to anyone who want to try Mediterranean food to come here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Middle Eastern food. Our first time eating here, the shawarma and combo plates are generous and amazing tasting. We love the baba ghanouj and the fantastic desserts. Best falafel I have had in NY, LA, or Also great customer service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for good shawarma and falafels!  I was at csn searching for some nearby places to grab a bite.  The yelp app had turned up Amena bakery and deli.  I thought I'd give it a try.  The bakery is located in the same parking lot as trader joes.   Upon walking inside I was greeted by the nice cashier.  I placed my order of one chicken shawarma sandwich and my brother had the falafel plate.  The chicken shawarma comes with your choice of veggies and hummus inside. The server, Miriam brought it out to us.  She was very pleasant and was very good at checking up on us.  At the end of our meal we had baklava.  That really sealed the deal on this place!  The baklava was perfect. It was so tasty and didn't just taste like a bunch of sugar.   I'm so glad my first experience went well.  From the food to the service, this place is definitely a place you should try,"}
{"text":"I expected other flavors based on a lifetime of ordering Mediterranean/Persian/Greek food however the quality and quantity of the food were good. Delivery was super easy and quick. Friendly delivery man."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat the food is amazing and I too k a picture of it is absolutely fantastic best hummus, gyro, authentic bakery with their own fluffy pitas and sweets to die for.    Price is very cheap for the quality.  I found it from my casino host whom said they order from them to cater for their high end guests.  I am a picky eater and normally don't yelp, but this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Amena Bakery and Deli is a delightful hole in the wall restaurant that serves up delicious food. While I am not a picky eater, I am not by nature an adventurous eater, but Amena's food has gotten me to enjoy Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"delicious meat and salad and a to die for mint lemonade! had the beef Shwarma plate and the meat was so tender and lean. will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food (try the kebeh and falafels).  Their pita bread is baked in house and very fresh.  Hummus is also very good.  More of a counter, to go set up, but they do have a few tables.  For dessert, try the kunnafeh, it's excellent."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! This little hole in the wall really packed a punch. My girlfriend and I were really taken by surprise because all we were expecting was a bakery / grocery. I didn't order from the menu at all, I just asked the very friendly woman behind the counter what was good and fresh. She recommended the chicken roll which came with pita, hummus and tabouli. It really was some of the best middle eastern home cooking I have ever had. I would recommend this place without hesitation. They have a great sense of quality ingredients with a flair for creativity but they stay true to tradition at the same time. My only suggestion would be that they should use less plastic and aluminum foil when reheating the food."}
{"text":"Good place ... excellent Mediterranean food.  I had a veggie platter which included falafel baba gnous cucumber with yogurt and the make their own pita bread which no one does ... service was okay ...but the owner (I guess) was great :) I'll be back here fosho"}
{"text":"Need a quick lunch to go and found Amena's on Yelp.  I ordered the Falafel Sandwich with hummus. The super nice guy behind the counter asked me if I wanted to add pickles and salad - Yes and Yes.  The service was friendly and the wait for my food short.  Too messy for the car - so I had to wait until I got back from work.  Still ended up on my pants - ha ha ha!  Yes, I am sloppy!  The falafel was delicious - crispy and full of flavor.  The pita was fresh and soft.  The sandwich had a good kick which complimented the added pickles perfectly.  Will definitely be back for more.  I need to try the lemonade and baklava."}
{"text":"I will have to Thank Yelp for this amazing place!! Wanted a little something different and came across Amena's... Can't say that I have ever really had mideastern food before, but after Amena's I will be having more in the Future!!! It was a little pricier than I though, but the food is well worth it. And as it is a Locally owned place the staff where awsome! They brought My friend and I free samples of the tasteing lemonade and the most AMAZING baclava I have ever had!!! I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great lunch!!! (And did I mention the best Pita's you will find in town!!! )"}
{"text":"Talking about a place with no character, way less than casual seating... 2 families were present when we came , middle eastern from their accent/language, loud, kids were everywhere! servers lack curtesy .. I give food's taste and presentation 2/10  if you are a true fan of middle eastern food , my simple advise is to skip this place."}
{"text":"Vegan options galore! Best falafel and hummus I've had! Loved the veggie combo plate, it's a large portion and everything is delicious. The falafel is soft and the best falafel I've ever had. The hummus is so creamy it almost tastes whipped. So happy to see that the options are vegan and no animal products included in the hummus and falafel. The best part is that they have vegan dessert too! The baklava was sweet and decadent, perfect treat to end the meal."}
{"text":"I have eaten this type of cuisine all over the world. From the Middle East to the Gulf States to India and even in my home town of NYC.  This is as good as it gets.    First of all, the home baked pita is very authentic, not your run of the mill dried out sandwich pocket. It is light, airy and moist.  Worth checking this place out just for the pita. It will re-define what you thought Pita Bread is.  When it comes to Middle Eastern food, I have 3 items the tell me if we are in for an authentic experience or not. Baba Ghanoush... it should have the taste of the fire roasted skin of the eggplant.  Bingo!  Houmous, a delicate back drop of tahina and lemon on the tongue. Bingo!  And finally, the Harissa, it should be fiery but you can taste the flavor of the pimento as well.  Bingo!!!    The owner's neice, Shada was a very comely and sweet young lady that took care of us.  The owner's family are Palestinians that grew up in the Israeli town of Nazareth. So there is a mixing of the two cultures in a world peace sort of way.  We had found this balance when we traveled to Israel and spoke with Palestinians who lived inside Israel.  Not to get off on a rant, but it shows that there could be peace if folks would just sit down and start eating together.   If someone's ear isn't accustomed to differences between Arabic and Hebrew they could easily mistake this place for an Israeli owned cafe.  They both kosher and Halall meats.    This place is about 2 to 3 miles west of the strip.  But worth the drive to get away from the maddening noise of the casinos and sit down to a home cooked ethnic meal.  And as long as you made the drive out to the westside of town, they share a parking lot with Trader Joes.  And who doesn't need snacks in their hotel room.  Before I forget, their pastries were delicious, my favorite was the baklava."}
{"text":"I recently went to there first location off of eastern had a great experience there service and food wise. I wish I was about to say the same about this place. Food was good but the customer service completely ruined our entire experience. From now if I do ever go back I'll make sure to drive the extra 30 mins to there other location."}
{"text":"The owner is very kind and welcoming! We enjoyed the lentil soup, chicken swarma plate, Turkish coffees and sweets. Food tasted homemade and delicious. Bought whole wheat and white pita bread to go. Super fluffy!!"}
{"text":"Super fresh food and welcoming helpful service. I got the veggie plate, an extra bag of their fresh made pitas, baklava that was delicious and fresh from the oven, and their wonderful mint lemonade, and fresh guava juice, both not overly sweet which I appreciated greatly.  They answered all my questions gave me samples of things to make sure I liked them, and helped me get all my stuff to the car. Loved it, and so did everyone I shared it with!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having a car in Vegas so we were able to enjoy where the locals eat, instead of mediocre tourist food that is provided on the strip at 5 star prices.  This place was amazing and a great bargain.   We were able to share the combo platter (beef and chicken schwarma, falafel, hummus, tabbouli, salad, baba ghanoush(sp?) and fresh baked pita bread) and and a bowl of their vegatable soup. This was plenty of food for two people. We also ordered their mint lemonade and asked for it to be less sweetened. Perfect combination to go with the savory flavors of the meal.  This will be a definite come back to restaurant for me whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Middle Eastern food, I cook it, I grew up on it, and I eat it most of the time, so, I was told about this new Resturuant Amena by a friend last week, we went there with other people, I looked at the menue that looked mostly similar to the other Mideastern Resturaunts' menues with a couple of more items, however, I was impressed with watching the bread being baked behind the counter, and being served warm from the oven, I was more impressed to learn that this bakery makes baklava and sweets (both middle eastern, and western sweets), I was even more impressed when I learned that you have the option to have your baklava with less sugar than you usually get at other places, and what imprssed me most is when I learned that you can order Kunafeh, this is a very specialized desert that is made in parts of the Middle East, it is made of goat cheese, hairy dough, nuts, and honey sauce, it will take them about 20 minutes to prepare it because they make it fresh for you. So, we ordered the regular food, and tehy made the desert while we were having our lunch which was heavenly, everything is so fresh, and delicious. the owners are soooo concerned about the customers satisfaction, when I bought few items from the bakery to take home after the meal, I asked if they had whole wheat pita bread, and because they had the whole wheat pitas baked the day before, and not the day of the sale, they refused to charge me for the pitas, which by the way turned out to be heavenly, I wouldn't have known it was baked the day before if they didn't tell me. I strongly recommend that you try this place."}
{"text":"I just don't know what all the fuss is about. I got a veggie plate for myself and a gyro for my hubby. The veggie combo advertised a few of the items (hummus, taboulli salad, falafel, and pita bread) that it included and \"much more\". Well, there wasn't anything more in my veggie combo that wasn't named on the menu. Didn't like the falafel much, kinda dry. The hummus was less than ordinary. The best part was the fresh pita bread and the rolled fillo pastry that I had. I would buy some of their fresh pit bread to take home. It's a decent place to stop for a snack, I guess. Still the fact remains, I ordered takeout; stuck my food in the fridge for later because I enjoy leftovers; and just ended up throwing it out because it wasn't enticing me to eat it at all. So I'm still searching for a good Mediterranean RESTAURANT & dining experience - not a deli."}
{"text":"Healthy delicious food try pita sandwiches and sweets amazing good veggie options and a wheat pita is for ones who prefer to be on a healthy side hummus making it all perfect"}
{"text":"Amena is our go to spot when we can't decide where to eat and we have never been disappointed. The pickled veggies you start off with are savory and yummy all on their own, and I love the olives. We always get falafel - the best I've had since Mamoun's back in NYC. The pita it comes in is fresh, fluffy, and they'll add a delicious dollop of hummus upon request. I also really like their gyro sandwich with lebneh. Both sandwiches come with your choice of tasty toppings like onions, tomatoes, two kinds of cabbage, pickles, hot sauce, cucumbers, etc. Their tahini and hot sauce can be added or served on the side in a bottle - I do both. Another favorite, even in the summer, is their lentil soup. It is velvety and flavorful, we always share a bowl and fight over it, haha. Sometimes we get a piece or two of their baklava - again, the best I've had in Vegas. I really like the baklava cigars, they're rolled up and yummy. Note: Last time we went we ordered two sandwiches and some soup. The owner came to over to apologize after we paid because he hadn't realized the soup was almost out and he didn't want to give us the bottom of the pot. I respect that as he could have just added water and served it as many restaurants would. He offered us our $ back for the soup or the chance to try a special dessert and OF COURSE we chose dessert. I don't recall the name but it was fabulous!!! Shredded filo dough wrapped around a goat cheese/brie hybrid and topped with ample pistachios, walnuts and honey. Looked like a pie and I have no idea how we ate it all but we did! I highly recommend anything from Amena."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Palestinian food. What a taste of home!!! Each and every food on the menu is made with great care. The owner is an amazing guy. Make sure you visit this place, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Come for the hummus. Stay for everything else on the menu.  My CEO brought eight of us here for lunch. We all got food comas. The delectable mint lemonade is a non-alcoholic mojito. The hummus... how do they get it sooooo smoooth? Everything was delish. The pita bread was a tender pillow of bread. No tough microwaved stuff. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A 5 star Mediterranean food bakery! I had to check this out.   Such a hidden gem in the Trader Joes plaza center on Decatur, very near the cross street of Sahara near the used book store. If it wasn't for Yelp and the amazing reviews I wouldn't have known about this place.   I had come to get my nails done at a location right next to this place and afterwards I was feeling hungry. I walked over and was greeted by a lovely waitress.   I had the Gyro sandwich and I have to say everything was DE-LISH! The food was fresh, the meat tasty. The staff was incredibly friendly.  I noticed tons of people coming in and ordering their breads to go! The pita bread is made in their bakery in house which is a real rarity and were so good you could eat them alone and be satisfied.  I sat in front of the pastry display, so I was \"forced\" to stare at all of those flaky little pillows of deliciousness. I literally couldn't leave without having a light little dessert. Wonderful place for a quick and hearty meal.  Make sure and save room for the baklava...SO good and it's dripped with honey and full of pistachios - delicious!  I have to mention that the A Rating was also a pleasure to see! Make sure you check this place out, you won't regret it! They also cater!  If you're in Vegas and want homemade, authentic Middle Eastern food, this is the place to go.  Will definitely visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Vegetarians rejoice! ...and Middle Eastern food fanatics!  This place is great!  I had long been craving sabich (ch pronounced like a hard hhhhhh, other transliterations use sabikh with a K) since the Israeli joint on Fort Apache and Sahara closed down over 3 years ago.  A little birdie told me Amena had sabich, so on a trek from UNLV to Centennial Hills, I stopped here for lunch.  Fresh-made pita daily, this place smells good and has a wide variety of menu items including sandwiches with schawarma, falafel, lamb to veggie pies, hummus, lebneh, etc.  I stood in line and looked frantically for sabich on the menu, but it was not there.  However, the staff resassured me that it is available, \"off-the-menu.\"  Sabich is essentially a pita stuffed with eggplant, hard boiled egg, and amba (a sour mango spread).  Amena serves it with hummus instead of amba, and then allows you to stuff it with all of the healthy fixins': red cabbage, green cabbage, diced onions with a tomato paste similar to harissa with a hint of spice, cucumber, sliced onions, and pickles.  It was a MOUTHFUL!  The staff set s'chug (hot pepper paste) and tahini bottles on the table.  I also got a Mexican coke to drink.    The sandwich was overfull of deliciousness, endless flavors, crunchy fresh veggies, soft pillowly fresh pita, a variety of beautiful colors, hot and soft eggplant and eggs....drool!  Eating this...probably seemed like food porn to the rowdy group of Israeli guys at the table next to me, chattering away in Hebrew.  I am so coming back here and dragging Eric R. who loves middle eastern food and fresh pita!!!  And for all of the curious readers out there, the word for tasty in Hebrew is \"ta-im!\""}
{"text":"I was taken by surprise when I first found this place a few months ago and now I stop by at least once a week! The ladies working there are so sweet and they remember me and what I like.   The fresh pita bread is so delicious with the hummus and the beef kebab is one of my favorites.  If Im not looking for a meal I usually stop by to get some fresh pita bread packets, mint lemonade and walnut kanaffe. You will not regret it!   They've definitely gained a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"It's a place you wouldn't find unless you are looking for it. Amena is one of the best Mediterranean food I've had in vegas. If you're looking for a good falafel, shawarma, gyro, hummus, or just pita bread. Amena is the place to go."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I MUST eat here. This is probably the best food I've ever eaten and the hot sauce is AMAZING. Better than sriracha and not too spicy.  You will leave satisfied.  Try the combo plates and make sure you get the baklava. The staff are the friendliest I've ever met and always excited to help make your first visit one to remember."}
{"text":"I'm out of state, living in a casino and craving good, homemade food....this place hit the spot!  I happened to walk in and was greeted with excellent customer service and the people there already ordering were raving about it. So happy to have a go-to for Mediterranean in Vegas. Yum! Hummus, falafel, lemonade and homemade pita bread are out of this world."}
{"text":"Ate there with my wife and son,  the food was OK... It was much better my first time there. Overall service and food get 4/5. Wait!!!!!!!!!! They're pita bread is outstanding!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We've been looking for good falafel forever and finally found it! Perfectly green and light and fluffy just like it should be. All of the food is made from scratch and it's definitely worth visiting. Everything is yummy and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Their service was above excellent !! The food really lives up to their we cook with love slogan. You can def feel the love in every bite :D They gave us free Baklava  on the house to us both. So so so very nice experience!  We are definitely coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"the best falafel and kibbeh in town! very friendly service , the owner really went out of the way to please. pita is made fresh in store and is extra fluffy. we got a veggie combo plate and the daily special of rice stuffed chicken thigh, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I went to lunch there was one other couple no other customers the tables where dirty no plates on them but food crumbs , I wiped the table my self because I already ordered the food , I ordered Combo plate which had different food non of it tasted  any good the only good thing  is the humos , the falafel wasn't cooked enough the shawarma doesn't taste any good I wanted to try kenaf pastry with cheese it hardly have any cheese , I always eat Arabic food in different restaurant I know what Arabic food taste like , I'm Middle eastern my self . And the price is too hi for the amount of food and the quality they give u , I will never go back there again ."}
{"text":"It's funny how we came about this place, we woke up and craved some Arabic breakfast so I googled and few spots came up and decided to try this place out, the food here is amazing and they were very helpful on changing couple things and adding some others ingredients. Definitely coming here every time we visit Vegas! Rawan was very nice as well! This place is a must if you enjoy middle eastern food"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Arabic food I've had in the U.S. I'm actually less homesick eating there! Grape leaves? Arabic-standards-amazing!! They bake the bread there, which is fresh and unbelievably delicious.   GREAT FOOD! AMAZING SERVICE!  Must-try!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this place.  Usually, I'm not too excited about Mediterranean food, but after having taking my first bite of my beef shawarma plate made my day!    Came along as sides, the hummas, pickled beats, and pickled cabbage were all distinctly flavorful.  Their homemade pita bread was fluffy like a pillow, unlike any I've had.  Sliced pickles and green olives were shared at the table.    Overall, I'd say they've got good service.  For the basically a $10 dish, I got more than I should have - gratefully so!   Keep in mind that we came in the late afternoon.  I wonder would it be like during lunch time."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall place is so good!  Walking in I was a little hesitant by the interior but the food is amazing.  I got their chicken shawarma with their in house mint lemonade.    My order came with a good amount of seasoned chicken, salad, and hummus.  The cherry on top of the cake was the fresh pita bread.   Everything was so good I ordered another mint lemonade, hummus with olives, and regular hummus to go.  And of course I got a few sides of pita bread.  The to go order didn't last a day in my household!"}
{"text":"Asked for beef shawarma where's the beef I will not be coming back 11$ this place is a rip off"}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty great but their customer service was terrible!   Earlier that day I had a coworker bring me lentil soup from this restaurant which was the best I have tried so I decided that I would actually go there for lunch. Upon entering the establishment I did notice there were a handful of people enjoying lunch so I kind of instantly thought it was going to be a great experience and since it was so close to work, I would probably make this a frequent place to eat. That actually would be the farthest thing from the truth!  I walked up to the counter and was not acknowledged for several minutes even though the women working behind the counter made eye contact with me several times. I reviewed the menu and decided on the lamb gyro platter and was going to be also getting a side of hummus to go for the girls at work. After a few more minutes a middle eastern couple came in and instantly the lady behind the counter said to them \"Hello\" and they replied hello back, still nothing was said to me, they started to talk in a language that I did not understand which was no big deal and they all looked at me, so the worker comes up and said \"yes what would you like\" I placed my order and also added an iced tea and went to have a seat. The couple ordered their food and sat down. 2 other middle eastern guys came in, immediately placed their order, the lady came from behind the counter gave them a hug, seemed friendly here. A white couple came in stood at the counter for exactly 8 minutes, I timed it and was never greeted and then they left without ordering anything.   The 2 gentlemen that came in long after me were served their food first, then the couple immediately behind me received their food next which did include stuff that looked to have been cooked longer than lamb gyro meat. It was about 40 minutes after I sat down that I finally received my gyro that was not put together at all, I guess you have to build your own here.  I asked for my drink and she was all \"Oh I forgot\" then after she dropped it off I asked if there was any way she could bring me silverware and the hummus I ordered?  She laughed came back and literally dropped it on my table!  Nothing to go with the hummus either so I ended up having to go to Trader Joes after I finished my Gyro so that we had something to eat the hummus with.    A few other people came in that were not caucasian and were promptly greeted and served faster than I was.    Although I look caucasian, I am mixed but feel this is the first time someone discriminated against me for being part white! I know that sounds ridiculous but also witnessing the caucasian couple not be acknowledged at all makes me believe that these people really do not want anyone in here that cannot speak their language.  As i was leaving I did see the lady behind the counter and say \"Thank you, have a nice day\" and she just looked away."}
{"text":"Great food great service and great great food lol Shawerma beef sandwich was great Def will come back"}
{"text":"I love this place. Worked here a few years ago and best proof that it's the best is that I still come back as a client and bring friends and family. Clean, good quality and we'll priced food. Everything home made and the bread is to die for. Also if you like sweets check out their baklava trust me when I tell you that thing melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Very fresh. Great variety. Friendly staff. Favorite Las Vegas restaurant. The best! Try the mint lemonade slush drink!"}
{"text":"food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced. owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will I be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in $2 drinks and $3 desserts the bill begins to rack up"}
{"text":"Forget everything you \"know\" about good Mediterranean cuisine- Amena is hands down THE BEST, most fresh I've ever experienced.    Not only is the staff and owner the most attentive and caring people I've ever met, the preparation and care put into each dish is outstanding.  The ambiance is great as well, a cafe feel with attention to creating personal space while openness allows for a sharing experience with others.  No matter what- this is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My family love eating here. It's heaven if you are from the Middle East. The owner and staff treat everyone great. We are Israelis and they are Arabic I believe and if everyone acted in the middle east the was they do at this place we would have peace in the middle east. Wish they had a six star option :)"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! Even if you eat a lot it doesn't feel so heavy! My husband and I came in and got the gyro plate and the shwarma combo plate which came with hummus and falafel. Those falafels are the best!! You can't beat the pita bread too. The portions are huge. The gyro plate could have made 2 sandwiches easily and the combo plate would have been good for 2 people. Didn't get to try the sweets this time but we'll for sure come back and not order too much so we'll have room for dessert lol"}
{"text":"The fresh pita is heaven. So soft and fluffy! Really, don't buy that store bought stuff anymore. Food options are solid as well. They have the best falafels. The mint lemonade is also a must. Very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Very nice and affordable restaurant.  Was particularly impressed with the falafel which had a nice crunch on the outside and a tender, flavorful inside.  While the meats were just fine, I can't help but think the quality of the meat and technique is below a place like Khoury's.  Still, it is a bit more affordable.  The hummus nice and flavorful.  The pita was fine though if they were made in house I'm not sure it was much better than store bought.  Perhaps they need to be eaten closer to when they were made than I was able to.  All in all I was very happy with my meal.  Also like that they gave you bottles with tahini and hot sauce.  Put as much or as little as you like."}
{"text":"Had the chicken schwarma and falafel with a side of jalape√±o hummus. It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I returned today and can't believe it took me three months to do so! Still blown away by the food (that I will be eating for the next day or two since there's so much:) and the fast, friendly service. Loving the #6 combo and some extra pita bread for good measure but I HAVE to try some of the other dishes I spied while I was over there today."}
{"text":"I have been on a falafel kick and on the quest to find the tastiest ones around town. This is a serious contender.   I love that it's a stuffed pocket and not just folded up like a taco and the bread is fresh made. This was how shawarma places I frequented as a kid did it. It's also awesome how you can pick your toppings! I like that they give you a bottle of tahini for the table since I loveeee tahini and pepper paste.   The falafel itself was crispy, but still fluffy inside and had good flavor. We are coming back for this for sure. We also tried a shawarma and this was good, but it's not quite the shawarma I'm looking for. Good spices, but the meat didn't come from a spit, but pan.   We also grabbed some pastries. Two baklava, a flowery \"macaroon\" of sorts, a date cookie. The baklava is money. It was syrupy in a good way. When you bite in it's moist with syrup, but it's not overly sweet. Definitely will be getting. The other two were just okay, I don't think I'd get again.   Prices were reasonable. Two sandwiches (I think they were $6.50 each), two drinks, 4 pastries was $26.   Conclusion- Falaf'n tasty! Bak-lovin'! Though there was a few okay items we ordered, those two items were some good eats. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken dip it in the hummus.  The hummus with the spice sauce.  Super delicious.  The date cookies are fabulous  The service:FIVE STAR"}
{"text":"I'm in love! Saw this place and tried it on a whim. Best. Whim. Ever. I had the lamb shawarma, one falafel ball, and a dessert whose name I can't remember. I couldn't stop ordering because it was all amazing!"}
{"text":"All these years making the expected trip to Trader Joe's (Being from Hawaii, I have to bring something back home), just realized a good restaurant was just right in front of me.  The pitas are made by the restaurant and is baked fresh, you will notice the difference.  The hummus is head and shoulders above the packaged ones you buy in the store.  The falafel was the perfect fry, crispy on the outside but yet moist on the inside, this is not easy to feat to match.  The portions are generous and the service is friendly.  Expect each dish to be just above $10.  Highly recommended if you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I need the preface the five star rating with he fact I am totally unfamiliar with this style of Mediterranean Food, outside of ordering lamb or a Gyro at other places, this was a new adventure.   Was looking for a bakery (sweet tooth was acting up) and found this deli for dinner instead.   I had a combo plate with beef and chicken shawarma humid, salad, olives,relish plate and pita bread included....I also ordered these little football looking things that o won't even try to remember how to spell, filled with meat and delicious.   The great server behind the counter was wonderful with answering my questions and the myriad of spice flavors have my mouth an adventure I won't soon forget.   Think I'm gonna stop by for some baklava from the dessert case before I leave town.   You gotta stop here"}
{"text":"Late post went there December. In a shopping joint. Away from Casino little bit of drive. Very good service. Good portions. Tasty meal. Will definitely recommend. Looking forward to go back again."}
{"text":"As much as I love it, I was scared from Mediterranean food after a previously bad experience. My brother, though at another time and place, was in the same position as myself - mine regarding falafel, his over tabbouleh. But we braved it to Amena after a time to the Korean spa to regain both hope and nourishment. Amena threw out of my inhibitions - evident through the empty places and pleas for dessert that soon followed.  My brother and I ordered based off our usual technique: divide and conquer. This meant ordering both the vegetarian plate ($9.99) and the Combo plate ($13.99). Soon after ordering at the counter, our food was brought out, and the Mediterranean bloodbath shortly followed. The vegetarian plate soon became both of our favorites - with hummus, babaganoush, falafel, potatoes, a savory Greek yogurt, salad, and tabbouleh. The babaganoush was so fresh and undiluted in its eggplant essence. The falafel was fresh out of the fryer, and absolutely blew my mind in its simplicity - who knew chickpeas could taste so good? The yogurt was literally thrown on everything, and made everything that was delicious infinitely better.  The Combo plate included beef and chicken shawarma, more hummus, falafel, potatos and another salad. The meat was really good, but honestly, we were more enamored with the veggie plate as we're not big meat eaters (also, we're suckers for babaganoush). Regardless, we finished off two plates within ten minutes or so. But I didn't even mention the pita! Fluffy, freshly baked, and housemade? My brother and I devoured the pita just as fast as we devoured the plates of food in front of us - rip, rip, meat! Rip, rip, falafel! Though we were offered more, our waistlines could not handle the carb overload.  Then there was dessert. Initially, we had wanted to order fried dough stuffed with cheese topped with honey. But somethings are just not meant to be - evident through my inability to pronounce the dish and the fact they ran out of the dough. The proprietors then suggested the kanafeh with cheese (around $7 for a small) as an alternative. Neither of us had a clue what I just got ourselves into, but a few minutes later, I ate my way out of oblivion. Reading my brother's review, the kanafeh is comprised of phyllo dough so thin it resembles vermicelli noodles. Throw that onto of cheese and drizzle honey and pistachios on top - that's a kanafeh. Seeing as we devoured two combination plates and pita upon pita, we failed to finish the kanafeh (much to our waistline's dismay). But it was the perfect marriage of savory to sweet, crunchy to melty.   To be honest, the food was only have of the experience. The service was above and beyond graciousness. Within two minutes of entering the restaurant, both of us were offered free dolmades - the grape leaves tender and fresh with the lightest rice filling I've ever had. The owners were always so sweet - always asking the two of us if we were doing alright, how the food was, constantly offering more pita. Suggesting this dish or that dish, their upselling would normally be off-putting, but when the food is as delicious as Amena's or the people as nice as they were, I don't mind one bit.  For months, I had bookmarked Amena. It was only until every other establishment as an option fell through that I was finally able to cross it off. Luckily enough, the gods were in our favor that day. The hospitality and the sheer deliciousness make the summer, when I come back to Vegas, seem so far away now."}
{"text":"This place is great!   Found it from the glowing yelp reviews and it was spot on.   Nice little shop with great items, the fresh pita bread was soo good.   -Beef Shawarma Plate: nice portion of marinated beef, hommus and a nie little salad. It was good, tender meat, nice flavor and good portion.   -Gyro Plate: Gyro meat was spot on, one of the best tatsing in Las Vegas, same sides as beef plate.   The tahini sauce they have on the side is great, smooth texture and great flavor. They also have baklava as well, I didnt try it but everything else was soo good I would imagine it would be good too.   I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We stop by here occasionally to pick up Middle Eastern baked bread to go, such as freshly baked pita.  They also have excellent freshly prepared Middle Eastern food, both wraps, and plates. Halal meat used.  They do cater."}
{"text":"Really, really good Mediterranean food at a great price! Right next to Trader Joe's in Las Vegas, it's worth dropping in before picking up some omiyage for home."}
{"text":"I am always questing for the perfect falafel. They are falafn good when executed well, which requires the perfect taste, the perfect fry and the perfect pita. Amena bakery comes close to achieving perfection.  The first time I went to Amena it was for their freshly baked pitas. AYUMYUMYUMYUM: that is me devouring a bag of delicious Amena pitas. They are like little clouds of joy in your mouth. I have never had a softer pita, and they stay soft in your cupboard for a long time.  Plus, they are a good deal. I can't remember how much exactly, but you are going to be pleased. Do not settle for grocery store pitas when you can get these for the same price or cheaper.   Moving on to the falafels, as you may know I think the best falafels in town are at Mad Pita; however, these are a strong second, and depending on my falafel mood, I might choose Amena over Mad Pita. They aren't as crispy and fried as I might enjoy, but they do taste scrumptious. Plus, the pita execution is solid. Have you already forgotten about the pitas? Well, let me remind you: AYUMYUMYUMYUM! At Amena, they do a pocket style delivery, so it is an easy handheld meal. No folding here. No fork and knife required. Plus, they have the little salad bar where you choose what you want in your pita, and are you ready for this, I am not sure if you are, but here you go: pickles. That's right. They have precious pickles for your pita. I love pickles, so when you add those to falafel, you are talking about a potentially habit-forming taste combo.  I am warning you: don't get addicted, but if you do, I'll be there to take your falafels away from you and eat them myself. Yes, I would do that for you."}
{"text":"This is probably the last time I'll come to this place.  First, they're waaayyy over priced!  Second,  understaff & last but not least the food was terrible.  I ordered on the phone and told them I'll pick it up and they said it'll take 20 min, so I waited.  Got there 20 min later and still waited 10 min and the server served my food in a styrofoam and just laid it and said \"enjoy\" I was like fine...I looked at the chicken and it was burned and rubbery!  Server kept apologizing and wasn't listening to me as I told her I only had 30 min. Of break and wanted the new chicken order in a foil since I've been waiting.  In short don't come here unless u want good fresh fries and hummus are the only stuff I liked.  Terrible and disappointed."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a bite. The Gyros I had was great. Right next to Trader Joe's so you can get your shopping in as well. Very friendly & helpful staff. You will enjoy the Mediterranean sweets as well."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and for a salad that cost $13 bucks I was expecting more and a better taste . I could have went to sweet tomatoes and paid less for a all you can eat salad and that's including a drink but I went off all the good reviews and they were all wrong. I won't ever go back"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Lamb and Beef Gyro with Yogurt Sauce Veggie Combo - Falafel, Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Tabbuleh, Dolmades, Greek Salad House Made Warm Pita Kunaffe with Cheese Baklava Date Cookie Walnut Cookie Chocolate Quickers  Tucked away in a shopping plaza on South Decatur Boulevard, Amena Mediterranean Caf√© & Bakery focuses on Mediterranean Food \"cooked with love,\" and although the restaurant, bakery and specialty goods store may not appear to be much from the outside those venturing through the doors are in for something quite special served by a team that really does seem to pour a lot of passion into what they do.  Owned and operated by Amer Hamed, the native Nazarene originally looking to fill a niche based on the foods of his homeland and a focus on Halal Meats and dietary traditions, entrance to Amena Caf√© is much like many other similar styled eateries with a counter to the right and tables spread leftward, patrons eyes diverted to a pictorial menu board hanging overhead without prices while both laminated and carryout menus tell the full story with costs very affordable.  Just under a quarter filled during the early lunch hour, many of those present speaking in Hebrew clearly regulars, it was with warm greetings from one of two women that patrons were greeted and after a quick perusal of the options the decision to invest in the \"Veggie Combo\" and Gyro proved a great way to take a wide look at the options with six styles of Mezze plus the Sandwich and warm Pita making for a fairly substantial meal.  Offering take-out and catering, in addition to table service, it was with the kitchen slightly backed up by a few large orders that perhaps a dozen minutes passed listening to the ethnic music above, and although the warm water with Lemon had a slightly 'off' taste in desperate need of softening the food itself showed no signs of compromise, first bites of the Chickpea Croquettes showing a golden shell give way to pillowy insides nicely tinged with Salt, the tiny Dolmades amongst the very best of the genre without overwhelming bitterness from the Grape Leaf while Salads were merely decent, though Tabbuleh has admittedly never been a dish that I've enjoyed much.  Spreading both the creamy Hummus and smoky Eggplant puree on warm Pita and briefly pondering whether better versions of either can be found in Sin City, first bites of the Gyro showed signs of a kitchen willing to let the richness of Lamb shine despite the addition of Cucumbers, Tomatoes and tangy Yogurt dressing, the $8.99 pocket probably big enough to be shared by most diners, though it also holds up well for leftovers to be enjoyed later.  A bit more spendy on sweets than savories, cookies and baklava ranging $2.00-3.50 each with all pleasant enough, though none prone to wow when compared to others in the city, a better investment is found in the $9.99 Kunaffe with Cheese, a Honey soaked take on Palestinian Kanafah with soft white Cheese cooked stretchy beneath crumbled Pistachios and Semolina threads that is as rich as it is delicious and also still great when reheated.    Obviously investing a lot of time and effort into the concept while carving out a niche that has been widely embraced by descendants of Israel and other nearby lands, Amena Mediterranean Caf√© & Bakery is a great place for lunch where one can eat as healthy or heavily as they choose to, some items better than others but all-in-all certainly a good choice for the genre and area."}
{"text":"Perfect experience every time! Come here for the amazing vegan food. Best baklava and dolmades (grape leaves) hands down! Their baklava is vegan - made with simple syrup not honey."}
{"text":"Excellent. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Had the falafel platter with tabouli and hummus. Everything was clean and delicious. Lots of food. Seven falafels. Need to go back often. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is good! Quality, fresh & tasty. The place however is always somewhat of a mess and disorderly. Tables are left dirty and unattended to while people wait to sit down. The Mexican girl at the counter seems to be overwhelmed and thus unable to attend to them.   The menu is very confusing and it's hard to distinguish what you're getting. Does it come with fries, or salad or tabbouleh? It's all guess work.  I live out of town and come to Vegas every month. This is the second time I've come here and if it wasn't for the fact that I'm middle eastern and enjoy the food I do t think I'd come back. It's going to be hard for me to come back here next month because of the confusing process and environment."}
{"text":"Random find while hitting up TJ Maxx for a suitcase to bring my Vegas purchases home.  Food seemed very authentic, fresh, and delicious.  I could just wrap myself in the pita bread and eat my way out it was like a warm pillow of carb heaven!  Portions were very generous.  I had the gyro with salad, pita and hummus.  I also had my first Turkish coffee here.  Strong (I love rich black coffee) but smoother than I expected, it was yummy and I loved the super cute cup it was served in. (If you're not familiar with Turkish coffee, it does have some fine coffee grounds as you get to the bottom.)    Service was very friendly, like you are eating at someone's house where they really care that you enjoyed your experience.  Love places like this!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say about the quaint little deli!  Super clean, great service and awesome food!  The prices are reasonable too!  Fun place to bring out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"For a long time I was stuck in a rut and went to only one Mediterranean restaurant since it was close to university. Thanks to Yelp and other Yelpers I am trying all these new places now. Amena is by far one of the best I have tried yet. My sister and I came here after a day at the Korean Spa. We had sweated out all the alcohol from the night before and came here for healthy food.   The restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and then they bring the food out to your table. As we were looking over the menu, the owner came out and offered us a sample of their dolmades. These are probably one of the best I have ever had. The leaves are tender and the rice filling gave it a nice contrasting texture. Served at room temperature, it was hard not ordering some. We ended up getting the vegetarian plate ($9.99) which consisted of hummus, babaganoush, 4 falafels, tabbouleh, potatoes, Greek yogurt, and a salad. After the last encounter with tabbouleh, I never expected to eat it ever again. The previous restaurant made it entirely out of parsley and had me thinking I was eating grass. Not at Amena, theirs was a good mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, wheat, mint, parsley, and lemon juice. The babaganoush was magnificent. Light and no one flavor was over powering. Like an ensemble cast, there was not one star, they all gave stand out performances. Like everyone mentioned, the falafels and pita are noteworthy. Moving on to the next plate, the Combo ($13.99) had beef and chicken shawarma, hummus, falafels, potatoes, and a salad. Ripping pieces of the pita and using my hands was my only thought. Utensils only slow down the eating process. Squirt some tahini and homemade hot sauce for perfection. Good thing they place a bottle of each on the table. I could not get enough of anything. Before we knew it, both plates were empty and all the pita was gone.   It is crucial to save room for desserts. Being a bakery, we wanted a cheese stuffed dough dish tossed in a honey sauce, but they were out. Instead, the owner recommended the cheese kanafeh. When it came, we were in awe. My sister guessed that it was phyllo dough, I thought it was vermicelli noodles. Looking it up, we were both right in a way. It is phyllo dough shredded up to vermicelli like strands that has a light spread of cheese, browned in butter, soaked in a simple syrup, and covered with crushed pistachios.   I had got a Turkish coffee as well. This was my least favorite item. It was too loose. I am used to it being thick foam and almost sludge like near the end. I also appreciate it when it is sweetened for me. I ended up not getting any sugar added to mine because usually it is sweet enough, but not this time.  With the friendliness of the staff and the quality of food, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town. Stopped by for the first time today and was welcomed by Rowena(it think that's how you spell it) she was very helpful with the menu. As I was waiting for my food I received a nice surprise, a sample of baklava, it was so crispy and the right amount of sweet. Once my pita arrived it looked so fresh and taste just as fresh. Check it out if your ever the mood for fresh pita. Didn't get to take a picture because I scarfed it down."}
{"text":"Visited Amena for the 2nd time today.   First time I tried a falafel plate with an order of lentil soup and was actually quite disappointed in most of the items I had with the exception of the falafel which I found to be a very tasty version.   The lentil soup tasted medicinal to me and in all brutal honesty was the worst version I've had and for $4.95 I quite simply have no desire to ever order it again, though I would definitely give it another go if it came as a side to something else I ordered, but I don't see that as an option on their menu.  This is a little frustrating for me because I love ordering lentil soup from EVERY Mediterranean restaurant I go to and don't really want to spend $20 each time to do it.  AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.    This time I decided to flip the script and go with the combo plate which came with several of the aforementioned delicious falafel, a healthy serving of hummus, some Beef and Chicken Shawarma, a side salad, and one piece of pita for $13.99.   Frustration point #2.  REALLY?  One piece of Pita?  With the huge amount of hummus they provided with the combo plate I really expected several.   For a comparison of my favorite Mediterranean choice, Hedary's provides 3-4 pieces of Pita for each and every lunch special ordered (and a choice of soup or salad to boot!)    Mmmmm, hedary's lentil soup.....  Okay sorry, back on track.   For what it's worth, that one piece of Pita was fantastic.  Fluffy, delicious, and perfect when dipped into the hummus (which I found to be a good version) or when used as a pocket for stuffing falafel and/or beef/chicken in it.  I REALLY could have used a few more, particularly for $13.99.   The beef and chicken shawarma had a really nice flavor from whatever marinade they are soaked in, though the meat did seem a little dry/overcooked.  The side salad was neglected by me like a red-headed stepchild which is the norm and nothing against Amena.    Lastly I also ordered some of the homemade lemonade which I just saw Nelson mention is blended with mint.   I actually would have liked something to mention this fact on either the menu board or when I ordered it because I think I would have much preferred it plain.   It was decent even with it, but I'm not a big mint in drink guy.    On pure taste of the food I had today, I'd give it 4 stars as the Pita, Falafel, Hummus and Shawarma all hit the spot.  Docking it down to a 3 based on the previous Lentil soup experience and for not being an overall good value in my opinion with the skimping of pita and pricey lentil soup.   If only I were rich Amena, if only I were rich...."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been several times and everything is fabulous. Mostly I have chicken or lamb  shwarma or a combo plate and share with a friend. But once the owner talked me in to the \"special\" chicken roll. It was to die for!!  Too bad it isn't part of the regular menu.  But when I was there today he said they'd have it again this Friday, May 13th.  My lucky day ."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall that you would completely miss if you weren't in the plaza. Actually, you still might miss it if you were in the plaza. The sign isn't very noticeable, but it caught my eye because it listed some foods that they had. I am really glad that my boyfriend and I decided to check it out because we were not disappointed.  I have tried Baklava before, but I didn't care for it that much before. This place makes it just right. Not too sweet, which is how I like most of my pastries.   My boyfriend was raving about the Shawarma, so we ordered the lamb Shawarma. It was wrapped in pita with veggies and yummy sauces. If you like spicy, definitely get the spicy sauce in your Shawarma! It is just the right amount of spice and tasty.   I want to come back and try their Turkish coffee with Baklava of course!  The service was exceptional. Mariam (sorry if I spelled your name wrong!) was helpful with her suggestions and made very good conversation."}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch here and it was amazing - very authentic falafel , kebbeh and shawarma . Just not a huge fan of their pitta - it was thicker than the ones we normally get at other stores. The desserts were fantastic- you have to get the kunaffeh it's made on demand is simply great. Service is good ! I will certainly be returning for some kunaffeh and Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"I have picked this place solely based on Yelp reviews and pictures. As we are not very familiar with the city of Las Vegas it took us a while to locate it.  It turned out to be a good idea to explore small local restaurants outside of the Strip. The price was good and the food was excellent. We had ordered a vegetarian plate and kunaffe to go. It was plenty for two of us. My husband went to get the order and he said that the lady who helped him was really friendly and welcoming.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone who likes Middle Eastern food or just wants to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place when I go to Trader Joes and after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed...it was pretty damn tasty. There were a few other people in the cafe eating when we arrived and we decided to eat in as well. The proprietors were super friendly and asked if it was our first time there. They totally made us feel right at home, as opposed to a couple other places we have tried recently where we felt like total outsiders/intruders since we weren't regulars.    We ordered a falafel sandwich and a hummus plate with falafel. That plus a couple bottles of water was under $20. The bf had the falafel sandwich which was stuffed with a variety of toppings (I had to have a few bites and it was delicious). The hummus came with 4 falafel balls and a stack of super fresh, pillowy pita (and way more than I could eat so I took half home--Mmmm midnight snack!). Soooooo good. I could basically eat nothing but hummus and pita  everyday and this is some of the best I've had--I'm definitely going to be frequenting Amena for takeout hummus and pita in the future...looking forward to trying the babaganoush next time too! I just wish this place was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Dude.  U walk in the place and you think it's a dirty dumpy market with a dirty kitchen!  But it's AMAZING!  I've been searching since Feb 2011 and it's Nov 2014 for good falafel in Vegas!  And it's crazy cheap!   I mean...AMAZING!  Grab their local honey on the way out..."}
{"text":"I came to Amena for the 1st time ever. I want to say How amazed I am on everything I tried; falafel, hummus, shish taouk, and the shish kabob are delicious, tasteful and the authenticity of the food is authentic. I am recommending AMENA Bakery and Deli to all my friends and family. And to anyone looking for authentic Turkish food!!!   By the way don't forget to try the Sweet pastry! Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"I've waited awhile to write this review to see if how I felt would change but since it hasn't here it goes. Walked in on a Friday at around 2:30pm. First thing I noticed: there were empty tables full of food. 3 tables were being occupied at the time but the rest of the tables were unusable because they were ALL full of left over food. I have no idea how long they were actually sitting there for...it was disgusting...but I really wanted to try their mint lemonade. There was one person ahead of me in line waiting to place their order. We were the only ppl there that had not been helped yet, other customers were already sitting and eating. It is now my turn to order. I place my order and ask how long it'll be. The cashier replies 5-10 minutes. I raise an eyebrow and say ok...wondering why it would even take more than 2 minutes if there is no one else waiting for a drink... I walk around for 5 minutes then sit down at one of the dirty tables that no one has even made a move to clean this whole time...12 minutes later...the customer ahead of me has gotten their meal and the cashier is just joking around with the cooks in the back. I approach her and ask how much longer will it be for the lemonade I ordered. She laughs and says \"omg I forgot you were here!\" Uhm? I say nothing and just look at her. She runs off and brings me back the lemonade she made 2 minutes later. Let me repeat that again. 2 minutes. AND let me also point out she was the one who made it. Not the cooks, which is who I assumed was to make it since it was taking so long. She hands to me still laughing. I take it and turn to walk out and she shouts behind me: GOD BLESS YOU!!!! This whole experience was enough to to make me never return and stopped my office from trying this place. The level of professionalism was beyond negative and the attitude of the workers was just appalling. The fact that this cashier instead of taking initiative to clear the tables for customers to sit or make my drink while the cook made someone else's order decided to just fool around is disappointing. I hope management does a better job of managing their staff and teaching them proper work ethics. Regardless that the lemonade is nice, it is not a place I will be returning to."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  We tried a little bit of everything and I was not disappointed with anything that we ordered.  The lemonade is sooo good its ridiculous.  And the owner Amer is so nice and friendly.  He checked on us a couple times to make sure that everything was great.  Definetly going to be going back often!!"}
{"text":"Friendly Service, Good food and modest prices. Try their Hummus and Tabbouleh, you'll not be disappointed. Their freshmade lemonade is good too."}
{"text":"Thanks to Poly for recommending this place so strongly.  Mamoun's Falafel in NYC is my favorite restaurant of all time and while it wasn't close to being THAT good, this is the best I've had in Vegas.  Hummus was awesome and I could eat the pita for DAYS.    Very friendly staff that gave us a couple of extra pieces of pita for our sampler and the salad was very good with a nice variety of stuff.  Came out to about $16 for two.    I still don't get how restaurants in Vegas can get away with calling their meat \"shawarma\" when its cooked in a pan.  It should be on a skewer or spit or something like that.  Whatever..food is still good here and I plan on becoming a semi-regular since I live so close."}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas, trust me, I've tried them all.  Apart from the exceptional service the lovely lady behind the counter, the place is clean, the food is freshly made and the flavours are as authentic as they can be.  Wide selection of all the good stuff!! Plus they got a pastry section that is just a feast for the eyes. Definitely will make this place a regular."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and willing to explain everything on the menu with a smile! One of the best places I've ever visited!"}
{"text":"The best in town you should try it, hummus great, pita amazing, falafel wonderful. You should visit Amena:)"}
{"text":"Ahhh thank the LAWD. This was delicious. We got the chicken shawarma plate, the veggie plate, the lemonade and some cigar baklava. The taste of everything was right on, just like how \"jidd\" used to make. Thank you for restoring my faith in good middle eastern food.  The pita bread is something not from this world. People were coming in just to get bags, BAGS of pita.  Oh.....the lemonade? SON. You've made a mistake if you didn't get that, turn around right now. Order 2. GAHHHHH."}
{"text":"Somehow when I found this restaurant on Yelp the 1st time, the reviews were like a year old.  I am glad to see these recent ones.  I am new to a few of these foods, but One bite and I'm Hooked!  This place is small, SO clean, and the waitress/owners very helpful and friendly. I bought the baklava and date cookies to go on  my first visit.  I don't like real sweet desserts and these were 'just right'. The date cookie my fav.  Back for dinner last night with my guy (Iraqi).  We shared the combo plate with chicken, beef, hummus, falafel, salad and pita (fresh, warm) bread. Also had a side of kibbeh balls and dolmades.  Everything I tasted was fantastic. Kibbeh is a new treat that I will place on a favorite list. For dessert we had the Kanaffe with walnuts, YUMMY. Every item was fresh, and delicious, and my guy said it was a 'great find' we can make a 'regular' spot for his favorites.  Yes it is next to Trader Joe's that I've gone to over the last 8 years or so and I never noticed this little gem.  What a pleasant discovery. **Oh, no pics ...sorry, the food was so wonderful we had it half eaten before I realized I should have taken pictures.  :0P  nom nom"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on 11/24/2015 and had a great meal! We had one Falafel plate and Seasoned Chicken plate. Everything was freshly made and delicious. The pita was out of this world! So soft and fluffy we had to take a package with us. We also ordered the lemonade, which looked a bit strange and was a bit tart, but it went well with our meals and was very refreshing.  The place is small and a little out of the way, but worth looking for! Very friendly staff. Next time, we will try some of their desserts."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had Mediterranean Food and I was not disappointed, the service was SUPER FRIENDLY, felt very welcome when we came in! They have vegan options as well, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich, amazing it was, and some homemade fries. Definitely will be coming back here again for sure, Thank you so much! :3"}
{"text":"Nice Middle Eastern restaurant--the food is good and the folks who run it are nice. I had the lamb shwarma, the other person ordered the falafel. Both dishes were good, I think if I go back I'd probably go with the falafel. It's also close to a Trader Joe's so you can do lunch and then go grocery shopping."}
{"text":"Came back to Amena for lunch.  It was great!!  I called ahead, and there was FRESH PITA BREAD.  YUM!!  By the time I got there, I paid, and food was ready.  Love this place.   And yes, still super clean.  Like you can lick off the floor clean.  And still super friendly.    Bought the Combo Platter for lunch, and 2 packs of pita bread.  $20.  I'm so happy!"}
{"text":"The owner was really friendly and explained a lot of the menu since it was my first time. The chicken shawarma was delicious with quality chicken (no fatty chunks or hard pieces) and a very light curry flavor. The pitas are homemade and DEFINITELY worth the $2-3 for 6 extra pitas. They're pillowy and light and taste how pitas should, not like from the grocery store. They also have what I think is a homemade hot sauce and it's actually spicier than anything I've had at other restaurants. The tzaziki sauce is also really good. And they gave me and my sister these amazing dessert samples while we waited for our take-out order! One looked like cornbread, but tasted like honey with cornmeal in it (sounds weird, but it was really good), and the other looked like a miniature cinnamon roll but also had a very interesting, light texture. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thank you once again Yelp Las Vegas!!!  I was searching for a yummy lunch spot and I came across Amena!  I not a huge fan of falafels but I'm a huge fan of pita :D  After having Amena's falafels in their fluffy pita pocket... I'm sold! Not a huge fan of their hummus or talziki sauce but the falafels and pita bread are amazing enough to make me want to come back soon!  Next time I want to try their chicken shawarma! Haven't had it since I was in Dubai. Oh and their baklava :D  If you love pita bread... stop by Amena's for their daily fresh baked pitas which comes in minis and regular size. I got a bag of minis to go :))  After lunch here today with my gf... I'm a big fan of Amena's falafels and pita bread! We both enjoyed Amena's!  Casual in door seating. reasonable prices. no stress free parking.  I'll be back for my middle eastern fix! -Miss Yelp 2011"}
{"text":"This place has something that you don't often find in Las Vegas: AWESOME, fresh-made babbaganoush!  Of course you can find hummus in all of it's one million plus versions everywhere all over town, but the babba here is wonderful! Just the perfect balance between nutty and buttery, smooth and robust, with plenty of garlic and that smokey edge. Be sure to pick up a bag of their home made pita bread...melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for good middle eastern food here in Las Vegas and have had a bumpy ride. Some of my neighbors mentioned Amena, so I looked into trying it. I went in the first time to check it out, and get the feel of the place. I am very critical at times of a restaurants kitchen and staff, if they apear sloppy or unengaged it is a big negative. I think of food almost like medicine bad in = bad in general. I liked everything about it but.... it seemed a bit pricey so we just got some pita bread and humus. I continued my quest for good food from the fertile crescent area. Months later we decided to give it a real shot and had a full meal. Here is what we found. Great yellow lentil soup. Complex flavors, good texture, and it tastes like it is made with love and skill. The humus was good, if not great, the baba was very good, the pita bread was excellent, the kibbeh was good, the deserts were good, and most of all the owners were fantastic. They were helpful, kind and very welcoming! I am excited to go back and try the grilled chicken platter and more. I am told that if you want the grilled chicken platter and some of the other main courses to order before getting there because they take more time to prepare."}
{"text":"Their food was okay but their service was tense and cold. I did not feel welcome here. Maybe because I'm not of the same race? I'll not go back."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this place while shopping at Trader Joes .on our way out we noticed Amena. My friend and I shared the vegetarian tappas plate..soooo good. Our other friend had the chicken shawarma..she loved it! We each had a sample of the homemade mint lemonade..delish  and a Turkish coffee. The owners treat everyone like family..HIGHLY reccommend!!"}
{"text":"There's never a dull moment here at this restaurant when you want great food and amazing service they always deliver! Amer is one of the friendliest owners you'll ever meet don't take my word for it! Come and try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review to include catering.  I ordered Kufta/Macaroni/Grape leaves/stuffed Zucchini/Bamia/ emjadara/ lentil soap/ Konafa with walnut /kalayat bandora /maamol and Harisa.  My guests were all impressed and they all agreed this is the best Arab restaurant in the USA.  This is authentic home cooking that's no different than back home.  The price is affordable but the quality is superior-best middle eastern -Arab food in Vegas.  I have been to all the others and none are close in quality.  This is the #1 Arab restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Some of the best tabouli in town. Made fresh onsite by the owner! Lots of lemon is the secret, I think...  They also have fresh baba ganoush and hummus and a place to sit and devour it all. the baklava ain't too shabby either. The place is not glamorous or fancy in the least bit. It's in a strip mall next to Trader Joes, but they get 5 stars just for the tabouli. Plus, the owner is a very nice man who always has a smile and pleasantries for you."}
{"text":"Eat here! It's so delicious and everyone working here is incredible, they brought us extra goodies to try and literally everything tasted so perfect! I had the veggie combo and it was huge!! Great spot!"}
{"text":"This the best Mediterranean food I have had in a really long time. I got the veggie combo to myself and it was enough food to feed two people. My favorite things on the plate were the baba ghanoush and grape leaves. The staff is super friendly and awesome. I highly recommend you check this spot out."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade, fresh lemonade.  Awesome falafel."}
{"text":"I found this place because of Yelp, and I'm so happy to be yelping about it.  I was at the hospital and literally yelped \"healthy food\" and searched the surrounding area and settled on this place due to high reviews.  It was easy enough to find; it's in the same plaza as Trader Joes.  There was only one person working in the front, but I did show up 30 minutes before closing time.  I ordered the lamb gyro.  She was nice enough to ask if it was okay to include all the ingredients, because that reminded me to ask for no onions.  I also ordered a chicken gyro, but unfortunately they were all out of chicken.  I asked for a recommendation, and she started explaining the falafel sandwich.  I was sold.  I took both to go.  It took about 5 mins for my food, just enough time to run to Trader Joe's and buy a bottle of wine.  Both items came out to ~$16.  I had the falafel sandwich.  It was really delicious, clean, and surprising light.  I wasn't ridiculously full afterwards.  I did feel like ALL the ingredients were really strong though.  The falafel were falafelly spiced by themselves, the hummus was very strong, and even the dressed greens were super strong in flavor alone.  All together, everything created a party in my mouth, and my mouth was happy.  I would highly recommend a strong mint afterwards though if you're eating in the restaurant (especially if you come here on date night).  I can't wait to go back and try more items off their menu.  Despite their strong flavors, the food was really delicious, light, flavorful, and really reasonably priced."}
