{"text":"Service was friendly, but took way too long to take our order on a not-so busy night. Our soup had TWO small pieces of chicken and the broth was bland. If you want good Pho go to the one on Ranchlands."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great customer service. Broth is always excellent and my go to Vietnamese Pho restaurant! Few recommendations I enjoy are their Peanut Sate, and Beef Brisket Pho. Best 9~$10  you'll ever spend."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food! The spring rolls are simply amazing. I ordered the vermicelli with the roll,  shrimp and charbroiled pork and the special stir-fry with chicken, shrimp, egg noodle and veg. It was all good fresh food."}
{"text":"Compared to other pho places in the area, this isn't the best place. The peanut satay beef was very salty. This place has lots of seating and parking."}
{"text":"Finally a great Vietnamese restaurant in the NW! I no longer have to drive all the way to the NE just to get great Vietnamese!  It was a cold night after work yesterday and I happened across Pho Anh. Upon entering we received a friendly greeting and quickly were seated.  Menu was a bit smaller than other places but it was concise and had all the core Vietnamese dishes.   We started with some delicious shrimp salad rolls and I had the peanut satay beef soup.   OMG ... the soup was amazing! They are now in my top 3 of best beef satay soup in Calgary! (Nho Saigon in Marda Loop and Lotus Vietnamese Noodle House in Vic Park being the other two).  Staff was very friendly and checked up on us a few times. Drinks were refreshed without having to ask.  After one visit I have become a regular!"}
{"text":"As you all know Vietnamese are famous for their beef noodle soup. I look for full burst flavoured soup that. The soup here is little on the blend side. The fish sauce is little light as well. Place was very clean. Service was good."}
{"text":"I came here in (my eternal) search of good pho. My smartphone app recommended this place for the peanut satay beef pho, so I arrived and ordered that dish, asking for slightly less heat than advertised--which they were happy to accommodate--with spring roll starters.  Well ... YUM! the spring rolls were just competent, but the peanut beef satay was VERY good! I slurped up all the noodles, beef, and added sprouts I could, and it was only modesty that prevented me from tilting the last drops in the bowl into my mouth.  Unlike other unfortunate patrons before me, my servers were attentive and responsive. I got the sense they were trying to address the issue.  In any case, I'll be back for that delicious dish again."}
{"text":"This is a fairly decent restaurant in the Crowfoot area, although there's nothing on the menu that would distinguish them from other Vietnamese restaurants.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  Our salt and pepper chicken wings were okay (not as good as the wings at Matador Pizza).  My beef pho (no MSG added) was excellent.  The soup base was flavourful and the beef was fresh and tender. The rice noodles were stuck together, though.  The boys ordered the barbecue vermicelli bowls with pork and shrimp.  The grilled pork was cooked perfectly (still tender) but we found the shrimp a bit small. Overall, I'm willing to give this place another try.  I'm hoping that they'll expand their menu eventually."}
{"text":"Tried this place when they first opened and I was convinced I found a new favourite in-and-out pho restaurant close to home. However, I had take out after they did the renovations and the flavours seemed off. Overall I felt a bit disappointed and haven't been back since. Not sure if they changed the recipe for the broth for the pho or if it's a new cook, or something, but it just didn't taste amazing. I remember seeing signs everywhere (before renos) that they didn't use any MSG which is always pleasant to hear at a Vietnamese restaurant, so hopefully that fact remains after the renovations. If you are looking for a quick bite in the crowfoot area, maybe check it out. I've just tried so many good pho places in the NE now that I can never go back :/"}
{"text":"A new vietnamese place where Bad Ass Jacks used to be.  Unfortunately, the same owner/operators of Bad Ass Jacks have just abandoned the franchise and gone out on their own with a new name and menu.   I'll be honest,   I didn't stay once I realized there were familiar faces there so I didn't try the new menu.   The food was never the problem though - I enjoyed the food from the last venture but it was the customer service that chased me off and had me swearing never to eat there again.   For years I ignored the poor service until the one day they crossed that line so far I was done.   I notice they have completed some renovations which enclosed the kitchen and it was the daughter at the till (the nicest of the family)  so perhaps they are trying to put a new foot forward with this new venture by keeping the worst of the family out of the public eye.  I did check out the menu before leaving,  the food is standard pho and the prices are reasonable.  If I wasn't still bitter about what was likely the worst treatment I've ever received by a business owner,  I probably would have given it a shot.  The one star might be harsh for not eating the food, but realistically it will be my hurt feelings that will keep me out of that location and nothing else seems to fit.  I fear they changed the part of the business that wasn't broken though but hopefully for them Pho Ahn is not just lipstick on a pig."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the flavor of my Vietnamese sub, but the subsequent FOOD POISONING was not what I was expecting.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed fresh Pho until I stepped into this place. Have been here twice and both times service and food were outstanding. Fresh flavourful pho and friendly family service. Great spot in the NW."}
{"text":"Is there anything better than a steaming bowl of pho on a miserably cold winter's night?    During a recent cold snap I wanted pho but didn't want to venture to my favorite spot downtown so thought I'd check a new'ish place closer to home.  Got a large special beef to share with the GF and an order of spring rolls and order of beef salad rolls.  While nothing was bad it was all rather blah.  The spring rolls had a sort of funky turmeric taste and the meat in the salad rolls was quite tough.  Most disappointingly was the pho.  The best thing about a good pho is of course the broth...that rich meaty complex liquid gold that hits all the taste buds.  Unfortunately their broth was very bland and didn't have any of that signature deep flavor.  Take out service was fine."}
{"text":"Tried the new Vietnamese restaurant in Crowfoot.  It's about time we got a good Vietnamese restaurant.  It's a family-run business.  Customer service was fantastic.  We were served by the niece, her aunt(owner) and uncle (chef/owner).    We ordered: 1) No.1 Spring Rolls - delicately-made spring rolls with the fish sauce for dunking the spring rolls.  Very tasty.  2) No. 14 Rare Beef & Brisket Pho - very good beef broth, beef came out rare (perfection!) and the brisket was sliced thinly and was very tender.  The usual plate of raw bean sprouts, mint leaves, chilli and lemon pieces were served for adding to the pho.  3) No. 22 - Special Charbroiled Lemongrass Pork Chop, Beef & Chicken - came with a bowl of rice cupped on the plate of deliciously-grilled and aromatic pork chop, beef and chicken.  Also came with fish sauce to be poured all over the meat and rice if you like.  4) No. 41 Peanut Sate Beef Pho - cooked to perfection!  I'm ordering the next time I go eat here!  I had asked earlier if they made this pho with coconut milk or not.  They said not.  I explained that we've ate a similar dish with coconut milk and the lady owner said she will try to make that dish.  Then, I saw a man come in and he came out later to tell me that he was the chef and the lady's husband.  When the food came out, we realized that the peanut sate beef pho was made with coconut milk!!  The chef surprised us with the coconutty-concoction and it was very, very good!  If you like coconut milk, ask for it in this soup.  It also has a nice spicy kick in the soup.    The restaurant is just starting out.  They don't have Vietnamese dessert beverages like 3 beans, shaved ice with coconut milk. They have other beverages like tea, coconut water, pop, apple juice, orange juice, beer, red win and of course, Vietnamese coffee (served hot/cold).    Check out this little place!"}
