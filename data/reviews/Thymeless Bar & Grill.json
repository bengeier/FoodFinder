{"text":"Thymeless is the only spot downtown that plays reggae every day of the week and is pretty low-key. There is no need to get really dressed up since there is no dress code. Dress up, dress down, it's all good.  Though the atmosphere has changed in the past few years (used to be a lot more RastafarI around, and a the back patio used to get a lot more full), the djs are still great. Dj Chocolate and Patrick Roots; I-sax, Friendlyness and more are some of the rotating deejays that can be found there.  The vibe is usually relaxed, but you find a lot of white women trying to chase black men, and it can really throw you off balance if you start paying attention to that.."}
{"text":"This place has its own charm to it.  I would recommend going here just to check it out for a very unique experience....  What you get here is a calm cool vibe with sweet reggae music in the air.    Someone below says that there are 6 foot rastas, and yes you do get that.  Trust me that I have been here over 50 times and never once seen a fight.  People are very humble here and do not want to mess up the place they enjoy going to.  Stay humble, respect people around you, and enjoy the pleasantness of the vibe.  Music ranges from conscious (mainly), to dancehall, to a drop in guy who will play saxaphone over a dj.  Anything can go so long as it is nice.  Remember you are near Kensignton Market,  only in this area could a place like this exist.  Everyone goes there to respect the vibe and the music.  Be on your mellow, and you will enjoy...."}
{"text":"Place has gone dowwwwwn hill. Used to be a cool spot and fun spot. But, the last time I was there the place was full of dusty and nasty people that looked like they just rolled out of bed. The vibe was just not there any more. I just don't know what to this place. SMH"}
{"text":"As the pictures show, it is not a place for classy dressing.  It was okay because the locals enjoy that they get a laid-back type club feel.  It seems to be very well known in the community, but a little ghetto to the classy person.  It's a caribbean place to hear caribbean music and I would think that that is the only place that exists, but they have to have more rules to what you can or cannot bring into this place if it is going to thrive from here.  (Locals will understand what I mean).  Oh, btw, the patrons who attend here seem very polite."}
{"text":"I kind of love how this place gets solid 5 star rating from almost everyone. I can understand why. This is pretty much a dive bar that has hit a niche of raggae and dubstep/techno.  It's QUITE the combination. Add that with a hodge podge crowd of skids, White kids with dreads, low-pant riding, big coat wearing \"gangstas\" all mixed within a scene that KIND of looks like a grunge mosh pit of awesome dance.  People come here to seriously move to the music. And I get why this place is popular- the sound system is surprisingly good for that little space; the DJ isn't bad- really- and there's some live vibin' that's kind of amazing.  Drinks are cheap.  like 5-6$ for bottles and hi-balls.  Just avoid the cloud of smoke and you'll be ok : )  The good: Good sound system; no pretentiousness; people that dance. The bad: If you aren't into this particular milieu of a scene you'll know it right away and bolt in the other direction. The interesting: The floor has EXACTLY the right amount of \"slip\" for good dancing.  I know that sounds weird...but there's a certain floor that actually really good for house dancing and this is it.  See you there."}
{"text":"I was waiting for friends who are always late and me being the neurotic Virgo I ended up downtown two hours before they did. I was walking around College looking for a place to entertain myself and stumbled onto Thymeless.   It was dark and pretty empty when I arrived. Good reggae playing. I ordered a beer. It was $5.50 for a domestic bottle. A little steep but still in the acceptable range. The bartender  was quick and efficient but didn't seem to care much about her job, real laid back, I liked it haha.   The place started to fill up at a steady pace. It looks like it might be a good place to party after all. I spent too much on beer so I asked for the nearest ATM. It's in the front of the bar. A+ for convenience. Then I used the washroom. It was pretty clean for a downtown dive. Another A+.   All in all I'm intrigued by this place. Very laid-back vibe, seems friendly enough. Close to my usual drinking grounds. I think I'll definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto two years ago for New Years weekend. We stumbled in here twice that weekend. Had a blast, danced our asses off, met some really welcoming and loving cats. We still talk about how we wish we had Thymeless near us. Good music, solid service and excellent vibes."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening at about 11pm. The place smelled like baby powder (hmmmm?). It was quiet to start, which was nice because we had a booth to sit in.  The selection of beers is good--as expected, many West Indian/Caribbean brews.  Other than my friend and I, there were about 3 other women in the bar and one looked like she was alone. All three definitely appeared to be on the prowl. Unfortunately for them, there were maybe only 6 guys in the bar and 2 were DJing and one was bar-tending.    As my friend and I chatted and enjoyed the reggae renditions of songs like George Michael's \"Never Gonna Dance Again\" mixed in with some Peter Tosh, more people started coming in - mostly rastas and reggae-enthusiasts of all ages. One older man complimented by shoes. He was cool.  Anyway, we stayed there most of the night and pretty much everyone in the bar was up dancing. Another woman who had come in with her husband was instructing me on my dancing...telling me I was using too much hip (sorry - I love soca), and not enough shoulder.  I can't wait to return to show her my progress.  There is a foosball table in the basement."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place to me today. I called to see what time they were closed because I was tryna go with my husband. The guy on the phone was beyond rude. When i politely asked what time they closed he was like \"the same time every bar in toronto closes\"with major attitude then hang up. Fair to say he's  a dick so i would never visit. If you're than rude over the phone imagine in  person. This is why i stay clear of caribbean own places.  The attitide is appalling. I am paying for the service not begging. WTF"}
{"text":"Hmmm, I just happened to walk up to this bar on a Friday night, and I decided to stay a bit. There wasn't much of a crowd throughout the night, and the music was just ok. Actually, it was a lot of reggae beats (so you might like that), but I myself prefer more dancehall. It isn't someplace I'd go downtown just to visit, but next time I'm in the area, I'll try out the Saturday night vibe."}
