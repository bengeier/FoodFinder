{"text":"Was here for a conference, staying on the south tower, this place was GREAT for picking up quick, tasty food to keep me happy for the day! The staff are real friendly & the potato salad is good. My first night in Vegas I was ravenous after a loooong flight, figured I'd get the a large turkey, bacon & swiss... It was HUGE! The 6' half was more than enough, though so damned tasty! I'm actually missing the sandwich..  Their French dip is also pretty reasonable, it was my first so I can't really compare it to much, hot dogs weren't too shabby either. Other than that the only downside is that it does close :P I'd have killed to have this on return from a night out!"}
{"text":"Located in Bally's next to the South Tower elevators. I imagine most customers are Bally's guests. Prices are good for a hotel restaurant. It opens early and opens til 1am which is good for guests. Food is okay though. There are seats too so you can sit and enjoy your food or you take it to your room if you don't like smoke. You can smell it since it's on the casino floor. I'd only come here I'm staying here and too lazy to go far to get something toe eat."}
{"text":"They changed the menu and took away the good loaf bread options but still offer the delicious sourdough bread in a small size."}
{"text":"Nosh at Bally s. The food was super tastey. Although it wasn't very cheap, but what is on the strip? I got the French dip on parmesan and want too interested in the menu at first. But I surely enjoyed eating it! Open 24 hours, gourmet food, tastey."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food. We stayed at Bally's, that's the main reason I purchase a groupon for Nosh.  However, The cashier  couldn't take the voucher on my mobile, it either had to be on app or on paper. I had neither. I always show e voucher with a the barcode when redeeming groupons, it works everywhere but not here. I had to download the app to use the groupon.  With the dotty internet connection in that area, so frustrating. After ordering, It took so long to get the sandwich, and I ordered sticky bun but got a cinnamon bun. The taste of food was not bad. The Sandwich on ciabatta was fresh n flavourful. If you stay at Bally's or are in the casino, it's a place to grab a bite, they open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Not good. Bread seemed lees than fresh. Expensive and prob gonna be a long wait. Only had one person making food for a line of plus 10. Then a fellow came out of back to help.  He had the big chef hat.  then he got tickets out of order and put provolone on my ham and Swiss.  He could not find the garlic mayonnaise so I got regular mayo. But wait!  The other worker helped him find the garlic Mayo and then I got it too. Mayo on mayo!!!  12$ for this???"}
{"text":"Came to Nosh for coffee and croissants this morning. Coffee is decent. My dad was eating his scone and when he pulled it apart to take a bite.. He saw a bug crawling from inside.. Interesting."}
{"text":"Located by the Bally's Jubilee Tower. Stopped by for a late night snack at 1am. Split a turkey wrap (lettuce, tomato, avocado and some aioli) which was quite tasty. I think it was boston lettuce but everything tasted fresh. It was about $9 with tax. During my stay at Bally's I would see a line for Nosh especially for breaksfast"}
{"text":"R.I.P Nosh!  We have been stopping to eat here for years and someone had the bright idea to change the sandwiches and managed to destroy what was the best turkey, bacon, Swiss sandwich in Vegas.  Also changed the coleslaw, which was delicious,  to some spicy slop.  BTW, BLT sandwiches are not supposed to be served piping hot and if you say applewood bacon on the menu it should also be on the sandwich.  Time to find a new deli in Vegas because Nosh is dead to me."}
{"text":"Fairly priced for the Strip (if you just get the sandwich). The sandwiches are served hot and on fresh bread. They are large enough to be very filling. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was pretty good. Arugula and onion-tomato salsa on the sandwich was a nice touch. I was pleasantly surprised given other medium priced hotel casino food options."}
{"text":"Nosh Deli. ...No Rye bread. ..No Cornbeef. ..No Rubens. ..Really. ....$12 for French dip with less than four oz.A sandwich maker set on medium slow speed.......Never again Zero stars.....oh nice napkins"}
{"text":"We waited 10 minutes for a cold pretzel dog that cost $7.00 with no sides! Definitely won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Horrible and overpriced. I got the chicken salad on a French roll. The chicken salad had way too much dijon mustard and mayo. There was more mayo than chicken. It cost me $9 just for the sandwich which means no drink, no chips. I feel so ripped off. So far Bally hotel has the worse lunch spots. If I wasn't attending a course here, I would never eat at any of the restaurants here. Tomorrow I am def going outside in search for a spot."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich from NOSH was one of the best meals I had in Vegas.    The meat was steamed and served on a warm crusty bun with cheese and slaw.   So good!"}
{"text":"Bland precooked breakfast and overpriced. It is convenient if staying at Jubilee tower but there are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"For the price of $12, you can't beat this 12\" hot sub, chips and drink combo. Plus their french bread is great! Nice crust with chewy insides. It works well with the hot pastrami and soaks up some of the slaw juices as well. Really a gem of a place hidden in the corner of Bally's. If you can find it, if you're looking for a good \"bang for your buck\" type of place, this is definitely it. I'd say I liked my pastrami hot sub better than my sandwich at Earl's."}
{"text":"I've had better hot dogs.  I've sure as hell had cheaper hot dogs.  But the two hot dogs I ate here for Christmas dinner were just what I needed."}
{"text":"This a solid place to grab lunch or a bite at all hours. Two sizes of sandwiches and getting the large one to split makes it a good deal and the quality is there. The sausage sub and the cold Italian sub are both winners and they do a good job of getting you through the line filling your order. Been many times and every time it has hit the spot."}
{"text":"Nosh is located inside the Bally's hotel and casino. They sell breakfast sandwiches and coffee. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when coming to this establishment and I wasn't wrong. The food is alright, but a little overpriced for what you're really getting.  One thing that surprised me for sure was the coffee. It tasted way better than I thought it would. There was a lot of rich flavor in it and it didn't taste and. I love me some good coffee.  I ordered one of their sandwiches and it tasted like an average sandwich. The food was alright, but if I were to come here again, it would definitely be for the coffee!   I wish I had read reviews earlier, because apparently there is a Groupon deal going off with this place, $20 worth of food and beverages for two people for $13. I wish I had discovered this deal! At that price, there is pretty good value."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much, but was really surprised at the quality of the food.  We had the chicken soup. the turkey wrap, and the pastrami sandwich. Everything was really delicious. The soup actually had vegetables and chicken in it and the sandwiches were not dry. A good stopping place if you don't have much time or looking for somewhere cheap."}
{"text":"Ordered prime rib french dip sandwich, Caesar salad and carrot cake. Sandwich was moist and tasty with a flavorful au jus. Sandwich was shared and was enough with salad and dessert. Salad was fresh with soft coupons and fresh Parmesan cheese. Untraditionally and in a CIA fashion We Dipped salad in au jus and was really tasty. Carrot cake was good with a taste of cinnamon and traditional cream cheese icing and reasonably priced at $5.   Sandwich is good for one person if you weren't interested in a salad. Came in the evening and pastries were half off. Picked up pastries/muffin for breakfast at $2 each."}
{"text":"One of the better clam chowders I've had. We'll worth it.  Definitely planning to get it again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Cute little cafes that sells breakfast food, speciality sandwiches, salads, and last but not least, deserts! And also all for an affordable price, which is rare to see when you're on the Las Vegas strip!  Great little place to get some quick grub for the low. I spent less than a $20 bill in here for almost 3 people (third person wasn't as hungry) and all of us were satisfied! Oh, did I mention that that was INCLUDING drinks!?  On top of the sandwiches, they offer hot dogs...... unless you consider a hot dog a sandwich! I won't judge you. Those come out to around $6 which is a little pricey for a hot dog but it's better than just your generic wiener in a bun."}
{"text":"I walked down from the Venetian to get a bagel with salmon. Got there at 6:50 on Tuesday and they were open but deserted. I asked for a salmon bagel and the cashier said they didn't serve breakfast till 7. Ok.  So I walked around and came back and she was taking other people's breakfast orders at 6:55. Ok.  I ordered my salmon bagel with everything on everything.  The bagel was not a bagel. It was dense bread, and too sweet. No bagel \"skin\" texture at all. The toppings were somewhat tasteless, even including the salmon. The bagel was a 2 out of ten.  The best thing was the potato salad, which was a side probably left over from yesterday, but was very good with bacon, redskin potatoes, etc. next time I'll just get that."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a lunch break to see if the sandwiches are any good. I have to first talk about the bread. I don't know where they get the bread but it is very GOOD! They serve breakfast sandwiches, wraps and of course lunch meat sandwiches. They also have an all beef hot dog on the menu for $3. Nosh is conveniently open 24 hours. I ordered the foot long pastrami sandwich and made it a combo with chips and a drink for around $12. I spend the same amount for a sandwich at capriottis and it doesn't come with chips and a drink for that price there so I found this reasonable. The pastrami isn't the best in town and isn't boar's head quality, but it tasted good enough for me to want to come back. This is a nice place to stop and a grab a sandwich to go or eat at a table in the seating area."}
{"text":"There are countless places to eat in Vegas, but I can't say they are all good. When I'm having a good time, my last concern is taking a break to eat. Also, when I take a break to eat, I want something good and I don't want to wait very long. I know if I want to, I could have a 5-star meal anytime I want, but I don't go to Vegas to eat, I go to have fun. So, if you're at Bally's or Paris next door, there's one place I recommend you to go eat and you'll never wait long or be disappointed. EVERYTHING I've eaten there is delicious. They even have something for your sweet tooth, all at a reasonable price: a delicious, hot sandwich on your choice of bread for $9 or a Krispy Kreme donut for $1.50. On top of all of that, the service is beyond exceptional, I enjoyed the food, as much as I enjoyed being greeted with a beautiful smile."}
{"text":"Had a bagel with cream cheese. Good warm bagel softer inside and crunchy outside at a $4 tag."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of Other Yelpers. Specifically they had mentioned the prime rib French dip sandwich for $12. We split the sandwich and we both agreed it was very flavorful!   We also agreed that splitting the sandwich between the two of us wouldn't be enough to fill us for the rest of the evening. Traditionally we share a salad as well. So half a sandwich and have a salad met our dining needs.   We finished off dinner with Carrot Cake. It was good but we thought the cake part could have tasted more of carrots.   A majority of the self serve tables were clean. The shop had a A rating. And at 6pm, the pastries were half off.   I would recommend this to the folks who want an inexpensive, eat at your own pace, without interruptions but hearty  dinner."}
{"text":"I work near Bally's and have often stopped by Nosh on my lunch/dinner break for one of their awesome sandwiches.  I've tried almost everything, from the Turkey Bacon and Swiss to the French Dip.  I personally LOVE their chicken salad, so it's always a treat to have that, too.  Their service can be a smidge on the slow side, but I've always gotten a great meal, so I can overlook a bit of a wait at times.  The staff is always extremely friendly and the pricing is pretty good for the amount of food that you get.  I'll definitely continue to enjoy Nosh as long as they're open!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy people... but a great place to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee at an affordable Vegas price. I had a croissant sandwich that was actually fricking tasty and the coffee was hot and strong!  The downsides are a lack of seating and a pretty limited menu, but I guess you have to make some sacrifices for low prices..."}
{"text":"Stopped by twice on my 5 night stay at Ballys. I regret not buying the Groupon they had before I left for my trip...  For breakfast, I had the croissant with bacon and a mushroom/spinach eggs. For $6.50($9.00 with coffee combo) it was a delcious alternative to an overpriced Strip breakfast. The croissant was buttery and flaky. The bacon was perfectly cooked and eggs flavorful. All the flavors mixed perfectly well and wanted a second after I finished.  Went back for lunch another day and had the Prime Rib of Beef Au Jus which consisted of Prime rib, caramelized vinegar onions, garlic mayo, cheddar cheese, and au jus. Again, very flavorful and it hit the spot for a quick meal. $12 for a combo which included a drink and side. I chose the pasta salad, which again, was very very tasty. Im picky when it comes to pasta salad but very much enjoyed it. Had nice size chunks of cheese in it and the cream mix was different then what I expected. It was served in 1/2 pint container which I thought was generous for a side order. I had leftovers so I gave it to one of those homeless bridge guys. He was happy with it."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place four stars because it is open ALL NIGHT!! When it is 3:00 in the morning and you are starving you will find Nosh tucked away in a corner at Ballys. They serve all kinds of sandwiches. I was starving and opted for a tuna hero. The tuna tasted like homemade and the hero was huge and weighed a ton. For about $12 it was a giant hero. Hit the spot and wasn't crowded either. Late night munchies spot!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here every day if not 2x a day while here for my week stay. My findings:  Super convenient if staying at the jubilee tower. Right at the base of the elevator.   Food seems fresh! Nice case of ready to go fruit trays, cookies, pastries. I was incredibly impressed with the cheese plate, exotic cheeses with fresh and dried fruit,  garlic, capers. Awesome snack for $6.  Be warned,  every morning the line is outrageous. It apparently is the only breakfast spot apart from the coffee/snack kiosk by checkin desk. The line gets LONG. And you WILL inevitably get behind one (if not two, depending on your vegas luck for the day) foreign families who have absolutely NO idea what is going on.  Their salmon lox bagel sandwhich is delicious though and the staff I encountered was very friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing on the Strip is cheap but this is the most affordable option in or right around Ballys by far for some decent food ... next best is walking a block down Flamingo to Ellis Island. Also the most economical place to use a dining credit.   Bagels range from $4 for just cream cheese to $7.50 for eggs / cheese / meat. You can also get a big hot dog for $6 or big sandwiches for $9-10 each.   Food quality is a little better than the usual quick-serve breakfast. Portions aren't overwhelming but are decent. Coffee is on par with Starbucks Pike Place - good enough to do the job.   Note that the breakfast combo deal has changed from what's listed on their online menu - now it's basically a 75 cent discount on your coffee when you buy it with any breakfast sandwich.   Prices are definitely a tad too high but it can (and does) get worse on the Strip. 3 points for superfast service and being open at 6 AM every day - can be hard to find Strip breakfast places that open before 8."}
{"text":"1.5  The reason why we came  here was because of the pictures on Yelp. The sandwich in Yelp looks good. So we were excited to try.   The place is locate next to the jubilee tower.   The menu was different from the one posted in Yelp. There was no French dip or an option to get 8\" and 12\".  However, we still wanted to try it out. I order the meatball sandwich and my bf did a combo with the roast beef with cheddar and the slaw.   The meatball was bland even with the salad inside of it and it was messy. The roast beef cold. And the slaw tasted spoil, so we threw it away.   Service was slow. The workers from the cashier to the cooks took their time, they didn't have any urgency while working. Therefore, it took a while to get our foods.   Overall experience, not good. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Not busy at all when I decided to stop in to grab some breakfast. I asked for egg whites turkey and cheese I received bacon regular eggs and cheese instead. I had to take a trip all the way back from my room to exchange my food.once I was upstairs with my revised order I realized it was completely cold! It's supposed to be a grilled breakfast sandwich! The cheese wasn't melted at all."}
{"text":"I was really surprised when this anonymous looking sandwich shop sitting right next to the hotel elevators actually provided a really great turkey bacon and swiss on french baguette. Bread was fresh and there was abundant turkey and bacon content. I definitely recommend it if you're staying in Bally's. The prices are a bit high but you get a very large sandwich for what you pay."}
{"text":"Very good experience here with our room including \"free breakfast\" redeemable at Nosh and Java corner. The \"free\" breakfast turns into a $9 credit per person you can spend until midnight. The rest is on you.   First time I had a very tasty croissant which suited perfectly my French palate.   Second time I had the ham and Swiss sandwich on French baguette -of course. I was tasty and filling.   The workers here were nice every time. The first time due to room change the reception forgot to credit my room but after the cashier called it all was sorted out.   Overall good fast and fresh food to eat seated or to go. We actually prefer this location over the Java place since we can be seated. Java works for to go food before taking a shuttle for example. Enjoyable experience which is not always the case in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was very bad. They do not explain what they have and gave wrong order twice."}
{"text":"Surprise!! Surprise!! Surprise!!  I haven't eaten here in awhile but decided to the turkey bacon sub with a delicious honey mustard slathered inside.  I was pleasantly surprised how tasty the sandwich was and they loaded it up nicely with some delicious turkey and lots of bacon.  The bread was very fresh as were all the veggies and lettuce tucked in side.  The sandwich was big enough to share, and we still had some left over.   I don't remember this place making such killer sandwiches, but I'm glad I circled back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Nosh sits right around the corner from the hotel elevators for Bally's guests in the South Tower. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're staying there it's convenient. The service is fast, and my friends adored the swinging order clips that fly between the cash register and the food station.   My big issues with the place lie in the price and the hours. It opens early enough for getting morning coffee, but it's $3.50 for a regular size. The price compares to the place across from check-in, but if you cross the street to Bill's, you can get a regular Seattle's Best for $2. The made-to-order breakfast sandwiches are great but pricey. I like the $2 hot dog option, but Nosh closes at 1am. When I wanted late night food on my retreat back to the hotel room, Nosh wasn't there for me. I tried one for lunch, and coming from Chicago, I have to say it was just fine."}
{"text":"It's ok.I world not say it is a 15 dollar sandwich. The staff it's so slow taking the orders and preparing you would think it's a 5 start restaurant.. come on it's a sandwich. I guess in a pinch and you need something and your here go fit it, otherwise there are better places.."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this sandwich shop because of their chicken salad sandwich. So being in vegas, hungry and hung over, a friend and I took the shuttle from the Sahara to ballys.   I ordered the large chicken salad sandwich combo with a side of macaroni salad and my friend ordered the french dip.  The chicken salad sandwich was huge, over a foot long with thick bread and stuffed with lettuce , tomato, onion and the chunky chicken salad. I thought I could eat the whole thing but given my state my eyes were bigger than my stomach and struggled to eat half. I'm not saying that is was bad, just average. The macaroni salad was bad with rock hard noodles. My friend enjoyed her french dip and ate her whole small sandwich. She got chips for her side and you can't screw that up. My total came out to around $13 but you really get a lot for your money.   Overall this place is OK for Vegas and did have fresh stuff for the sandwiches. It will give you another option besides McDonalds and Subway."}
{"text":"This review is just for the bagels because it is all I have had there. It is all I care to have at Nosh. They are so amazing...they haunt my dreams..."}
{"text":"We were desperate for a quick sandwich before our night out.  This place came to our rescue, I guess?  We split the Chedder roast beef.  I was picturing a roast beef sandwich with chedder cheese, right?  So the roast beef was sooooo fatty.  I was pulling off huge chunks of fat.  Also the chedder \"cheese\" was really like a nacho cheese sauce like cheese sauce.  Yuck...  The best part of the sandwich was the huge baguette they put it on.  However, the sandwiches were a good size.  Maybe it was just the type we ordered that was bad."}
{"text":"This place is really busy. The food is very good for a cafe. The price is is the same as any other sandwhich shop. I recommend purchasing a group on...Great savings. I ordered the clam chowder and it was very meaty with seafood. The sauce was delicious. We also ordered roast beef on rye. Complements to the chefs, the coleslaw made it juicy and fantastic.You just want to order another one. The staff are friendly and quick to prepare. Check this place out, it's hidden in Bally's Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite to eat before heading to the \"Paranormal\" show. A little slow, but things were fresh and hot. Friendly and helpful staff - great pasta salad. The turkey sandwich had a wonderful flavor and was huge!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best places in Vegas. A true five-star ,but that has changed. I have been going to Nosh for 6 years now it was the best place to get a sandwich on the strip. But now they give you half a sub for a dollar more than it used to be for a full 12 inch sub sometimes 13 or 14 inch. Can't stand when corporations rip people off like that especially when they had a good thing going, it's all for the profit. They know you're in the hotel and there's nowhere else you can go. Sad to say Nosh is a no-go."}
{"text":"????????????????????????Ballys????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here on my Vegas trips.  The food is fresh, and the service is good.  Plus on this last trip they had a spectacular combo special for only 12 bucks.  Included was a foot long sandwich, a bag of chips and a drink!  The sandwich was LOADED with stuff, and that really surprised me.  Conveniently located in Ballys by the Poker Tournament tables."}
{"text":"Great French Dip an the fiancé's pastrami was really good too. The guy taking our order was slow but the food was SO GOOD! will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. This is a great place for a quick yet tasty bite. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is welcoming.   No, this is not a sit down restaurant but it is definitely a few steps above Subway.   This is our go to spot to satisfy the hunger and not put a dent in our budget.   See you there !"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for a convention that is right by Nosh and I have to say this place is weird...First off, credit where credit is due, it's good food at a decent price, but I think it may be under new management or something?  The people working there seem to have NO clue what they are doing and can hardly speak English.  The first time we went, the lady behind the register kept running over to the guy making the sandwiches and \"training\" him, so that was weird...they got my order slightly wrong but I figured whatever, mistakes happen.  Then yesterday morning the soda machine was flat and they forgot the danish I ordered...then last night it took us about 30 minutes to get our sandwiches.  They served everyone in a total wonky order (and you can see them making the food so it was obvious it wasn't a particular order that was messed up, they were just arbitrarily picking orders) finally my husband went up to see if they started his order, they hadn't so they did then, but it took them 10 minutes and by that time he was running late to his event.  I then had to remind them of my sandwich, a french dip.  When I said \"French dip\" I might as well have been speaking Klingon, the lady had no clue what that was and then ended up making me a dry roast beef and cheddar sandwich that I accepted in defeat... I just wanted it to end...anyway, seems to me like maybe someone should train people here..."}
{"text":"This is a good option if you need a quick breakfast and staying at Bally's or Paris. We walked all along Paris and didn't feel like having a crepe or sweet, buttery pastry. So we found this place and they have very reasonable bagel sandwiches for only $6. They were really good too and a decent size. The bagels are nice and chewy too."}
{"text":"The food is actually really good. Only giving 2 stars because the cashier asked to see my ID for a credit card transaction and didn't ask ppl ahead of me the same. Seems to be a common discriminatory practice in Vegas. Again, maintain the same polices for ALL patrons."}
{"text":"This place saved me!   When you're in Las Vegas, it's very difficult to find a fast place to grab a quick bite. Nosh is inexpensive and has a large variety of sandwiches.   They make everything fast and I was able to get back to my game of Blackjack.   They had excellent desserts too. That chocolate twist had me on that sugar high. So good!   Great for sitting there or taking it to my room. This is why I love Bally's!   The broads who were making the sandwiches were really nice and dope!"}
{"text":"Do not buy the hot pastrami unless you are looking for a very salty fried bologna sandwich on doughy flavorless parmesan cheese bread. So salty it was truly inedible. Unfortunately, I had brought it back to my room to eat, so I had to wait to throw it away until I went out again. The fruit cup was ok. I was very disappointed that they won't serve breakfast sandwiches until 7am. That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"If you're staying at Bally's, had a long, but exciting night, and in dire need some some food to munch on without table service, Nosh is there for the rescue!  It was my last night during my last visit to Vegas and by that time I really wasn't in the mood to go to a sit-down restaurant, nor travel far to grab some food elsewhere.  I was tired but luckily Nosh was there thanks to them being open 24 hours a day.  They have some really good specials like their $3 Hot Dogs and $12 Foot Long Sandwiches.     I ordered their Large Italian Sandwich and as you can see, this sandwich was loaded!! (http://bit.ly/1yLBvZS).  The bread was good and they definitely piled in the meat.  It definitely hit the spot for me before calling it a night.  For being open 24 hours and offering a nice selection of sandwiches and snacks, Nosh is a dependable spot if you're staying at Bally's."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for breakfast twice and both times really enjoyed it. I'm only reviewing this place based on breakfast.  This location is tucked away in the corner of Bally's by the bathrooms, so it may not be super easy to find, but once you do, I recommend it.  They have a lot of things to choose from, but the smoked salmon on a bagel sounded the best. After choosing a whole wheat bagel, it was toasted, cream cheese added, smoked salmon, capers and red onions. This was a very satisfying meal. The salmon was almost like butter and very easy to eat. The capers added a nice touch with the red onion and cream cheese.   We also got a yogurt parfait to share and it was fine. Actually a really good deal and a nice ending to a great breakfast.   Tip: Go early. As the morning gets closer to lunch, the line gets longer. There's only one cook, so longer line means longer wait time.   If you're in the mood for a tasty bagel with salmon, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Decent for a quick breakfast. The eggs are precooked and not fresh. The other bakery pastries (bagels, danish, etc) were good! And the iced coffee was good, even though more expensive than Starbucks (how does that happen?). So look for a Groupon ($13 for $20) which makes it a little more palatable."}
{"text":"NOSH is a little sandwich shop tucked into the corner of Bally's Casino. Good sandwiches and good drinks .... The really good thing is that all the good stuff is available late at night.  I had their chicken salad sandwich on toast and it hit he spot after a late evening (early morning) also, after all of the places in the Paris have closed. They specalize in \"Dogs,\" but I was just not in the mood. A sandwich and bag of chips hit the spot. The shop is located right next to the hallway leading to the tower rooms so you can not miss it. A good spot for a late night snack ..... if you find yourself in that part of the Vegas strip"}
{"text":"Mmm. Really like my smoked salmon bagel for breakfast every morning during my Vegas stay! Would've been nice to have access to refill my coffee though."}
{"text":"Super affordable sandwich place located around Bally's casino. Great value because usually everything on the strip is expensive. At least you aren't really sacrificing any quality with Nosh.  The food was actually pretty decent compared to other quick breakfast places. Definitely better tha your typical Denny/IHOP, as this food had some flavor to it.   Ended up spending less than $20 for two people including drinks. That's value to me, especially if I am looking for value meals on the strip!!!!"}
{"text":"Won big at the roulette table, got hammered and went to take a nap.  Woke up and felt like a*s but wanted to get some food in me so I stumbled down to Nosh to grab a sandi.  The wait was a little long but ended up ordering the Italian combo sandi and the chicken noodle soup.    Soup was awesome!  Chock full of love.    Sandi meat was good but the the bread ... ummm ... have you ever chewed on a rock?  Dont get the baguette unless you 1) have dental insurance or 2) dont mind shards on skin hanging from the top of your mouth."}
{"text":"Stayed at Bally for the weekend and this cafe was nearest the elevators to my room.  Open 24hours and such good quality for the price.  I think I are here everyday. All meals are under $10 and the quality is fresh, and portion is big.  Food-during the 4 days I stayed I tried egg salad sandwich, chef salad, hot dogs, pastrami, clam chowder, chicken noodle, roast beef. All were very impressive in taste, price, and quality. I didn't except such good quality for cheap price.  Staff-all very nice and welcoming. They all remembered me and my friends because we ate her every night piss drunk stumbling to the elevators. There probably use it, but they hooked us up with some donuts and bagels so I threw a few bucks extra for tip."}
{"text":"We had complimentary breakfasts included in our stay. We chose Nosh. They serve breakfast until 11:00. I had the bagel and coffee combo, the coffee was average, but the bagel was delicious. You can butter or cream cheese in it. The Husband had the breakfast sandwich and coffee combo. He loved the sandwich. It was eggs, bacon, cheese and ham in a croissant. The combos were $7 - $9 bucks. Super cheap. They have very limited seating, however we found a really nice lady who shared her table with us. But you could always take it to go. Great value for food especially if it's complimentary."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, not a glamourous deli by any stretch but located conveniently off to the less quieter corner of Bally's, by the Keno area.  Ordered the roast beef dip on French bread, which was quite surprisingly fresh and soft; but the meat was a bit on the dry side, though nicely sliced thinly.  Even dipping into the au jus, which felt a bit heavy on the salty side.  But parents enjoyed the BLT.  Still will return simply b/c they have Krispy Kreme donuts, albeit today just the chocolate glazed and originals ;)"}
{"text":"They take forever! We just ordered bagel with cream cheese and it took a good hour! Horrible they work like turtles! Soo slow"}
{"text":"Nosh is located inside of Ballys Hotel. The food there is great and not pricey. I had the BLT on wheat. Best BLT ever!! It was a little crowded but its worth the wait. The staff was very friendly and I didnt have to wait but a few minutes before my order was ready. I recommend this place. =)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Stayed at the hotel for a week, and ate here many times...breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Interesting thing- they did a menu revamp halfway through our trip and the new menu is absolutely delicious! We had a turkey, avocado, and bacon sandwich with mixed greens on ciabatta.  Delicious.  But our absolute favorite is their chicken noodle soup.  So fresh.  Quite possibly the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had.  The prices here are fantastic.  If you are staying at the hotel, keep your cup for free refills.  Oh! And the peanut butter cookies are SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot pastrami sandwich with tasty red potato salad and an icy cold beer is ideal before seeing Jubilee thirty feet away."}
{"text":"Great sandwich for the price!  Ordered the footlong 'Wanna be a Reuben' and it was well worth it!  Served on a tasty parmesan roll and filled with pastrami and coleslaw.  It's a great place to go if you're looking for take out sandwiches/food!"}
{"text":"Good if you are in the hotel and especially in Jubilee tour it sits next to.  Pricey but average for A Vegas hotel.  But the food was excellent.  The croissant sandwiches were very delicious.  Had the bacon/egg one.  Also, the raisin cinnamon roll was excellent.  At 10:30 am on a Thursday they were packed and no seating (although if you aggressively have a family member look for people leaving you can get a seat)."}
{"text":"It came to almost five dollars for a bland cup of coffee. There's no reason to dine at Nosh unless you can't walk another two hundred feet or so outside to the strip.  So, please by all means, eat and drink the incredibly mediocre offerings from Nosh ONLY if you can't work up enough energy or stave off enough drunkenness to get yourself out Bally's front door and find a real place to eat that will give you better than average service and not quite as overpriced (for the quality) dining options."}
{"text":"To say this place is over-priced is an understatement. $4.05 for a 16 oz. cup of coffee? Starbucks is cheaper than that! Of course I could have had free coffee on the casino floor if I could find a waitress!"}
{"text":"We had our breakfast here on the way out of town.  Breakfast special was a croissant with bacon, cheese, and \"egg\".  (The egg tasted fine, but it looked weird.  Like they cooked a bunch of egg in a sheet pan and sliced it apart.)  The coffee was good, it was fast since all they did was put it together and microwave it.  My wife had a banana that was $1.50.  I had to laugh at that - if you go to the grocery story you can get almost 4 pounds of bananas for that much.  Ahhh, the price of eating at a Las Vegas casino.  We'd eat here again... maybe no bananas, though."}
{"text":"When we come to Vegas, we typically stay in one of the hotels on the strip. Nosh's Deli has provided us a fast and inexpensive breakfast option numerous times. My father-in-law always gets the bacon egg and cheese bagel, and my wife and I get the bagel and lox, with capers and red onion (the only thing that would make it better is if they offered slice lemon). While these offerings may not be haute cuisine, they taste good, and at 7-8 dollars, can be a much better option than the $49 buffet over at Caesars. Also, since it is centrally located near the front of Bally's casino, it is convenient, and prompt.."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I eat here a lot when I play poker at Bally's and use my tier credits to pay for my meals. The Pastrami and BLT sandwiches are my favorites. The soup and bread here are amazing too."}
{"text":"Omg for a hotel sandwich place, this place is good. Well I can only vouch for the prime rib sandwich. It was so good! So good that I ate it twice during my 3 night trip. The sandwich had onions, cheese, mayo and came with an Au jus dip. If you love prime rib and are staying at Ballys or happen to walk through stop here and get this!"}
{"text":"Croutons stale in Caesar salad.  Carrot cake good.  Fruit plate good.  Over $30 umm no not good."}
{"text":"The girl who took my order was so rude and so cold. She was so rude!! She had brown hair. I really hope they fire her because she doesn't deserve to be working there. Other than that the food was really good."}
{"text":"Overpriced like always. Got 2 regular drinks (soda) and 1 cookie. Spent almost $10 bucks.   Had some nats flying around the soda area, but I could say this though Pepsi was super refreshing.    Not worth spending that much for something that roughly cost 3-5 bucks. Lady was very friendly though."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for lunch because of a Groupon deal we found. The deal was $20 of food & beverages for 2 people for $13. We were pleasantly surprised by this place! It was a bit of a maze to get through Bally's to find, but I'm happy we did. This restaurant is good for a quick lunch or snack at fair prices.  I chose the grilled veggie sandwich on ciabatta and my boyfriend chose the Italian hoagie on a hoagie roll. My sandwich was a bit oily from the roasted veggies but nothing terrible. Overall, both of our sandwiches were fresh, flavorful, and filling. We shared a soda and a bag of chips also.  I believe our total was $23, so we only had to pay a few dollars out of pocket for this meal. We would definitely return here when we are back in vegas just for the prices, even if we didn't have the Groupon! For most of our meals in Vegas, we decided to split something to cut down on costs. The fact that we each got a decent sized sandwich, a bag of chips, and a soda for under $25 is practically unheard of in Vegas.  One negative of this place is that the seating is somewhat limited as they are only a small cafe. Also, it's right next to the casino, so it's pretty loud and filled with the scent of cigarette smoke, but I'm sure this fact is also what makes it convenient for people who want a quick snack while gambling. We will for sure be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had exactly what I wanted when I wanted it. Long line on Sunday morning and the taste of my egg and cheese on a bagel was pretty bland. But I was happy to have that egg and cheese bagel when that was exactly what I was in the mood for."}
{"text":"I stayed at Bally's on the south tower. Was tired and hungry. Did want to grab a quick bite so I ordered 3 hot dogs and 1 clam chowder from Nosh. The hot dogs were dried and the clam chowder was too salty. When I told the cashier that it was very salty and she goes \"SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? What kind of attitude is that? I was very upset with her attitude and asked for the refund and she goes \" I can't do that!\" I was like \" Then please replace it with the chicken soup.\" And the other cashier gave me the dirty look and dipped the clam chowder to taste it. After she tasted the clam chowder, she knew that it was too salty to serve, she put the hot water into the pot. WHAT THE HECK? And she gave me the chicken soup and it was $1.00 cheaper than the clam chowder. I asked for the refund of it since they both had the nasty attitude. They refused it and told me to grab a cookie or the snack. I had the worst clam chowder in my whole life as the service. I will not stay at Bally's nor will go to this place ever. My company stays at Bally's all the time for the trade shows and my coworkers spend a lot of money there. But tell them 'Bye Bye\" Can't forget their names. Worst cashiers with bad attitudes NORMA AND YVONNE!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently horrible service. Pretty sure the lady that has the horrible attitude is the manager too. The level of attitude is mind-boggling but I put up with it bc I have always wanted a bagel more than I cared. This last visit, however, the bagel lady made my order wrong and was argumentative with me (even though it was her mistake) and started like slopping my bagel around in an unappealing way with her (at least gloved) fingers and refused to re-make her error. It was a weird back and forth bc she obviously made an error. I pay for a $12 bagel, I tip, and keep returning even though all of you are excessively bitchy, but thank god I don't have to anymore bc I found better spots without the unnecessary attitude. Hate this place. Ultimately she did \"offer\" to remake it LOL but she like grabbed my bagel all aggressively and at that point I didn't want her to Touch my food at all. So gross."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good turkey sandwiches; I can't speak for any other menu item but I did have two turkey & swiss on wheat (with bacon) sandwiches, and each time it was executed wonderfully - soft bread, good quality turkey, crisp bacon and a nice cut of swiss. A sandwich is rather simple, but this was notable enough for me to review - and to have twice. Good work to the team at Nosh, a rather unspectacular looking joint tucked away in a nearly-barren corner of Bally's."}
{"text":"Awful and expensive.  Had a prime rib sandwich. Had a couple bites and threw away the rest.  Mac salad was very dry and had no flavor."}
{"text":"Foods ok but way over priced for what you get. 2 small sandwiches, 1drink, 2 Danishes and a bag of small chips for $32. Really??? It's like airport prices such price gouges knowing late night not much options and too tired to drive somewhere."}
{"text":"This little cafe/deli is right by the elevator to our renovated Bally's room in the Jubilee Tower.  Let's just say this is a good spot for drunks who are way too lazy to find a decent restaurant to dine at and even for those who are just in a hurry and need some sustenance so they don't go hangry.   I had a Veggie Wrap here. I had a Croissant Breakfast Sandwich here. I also had a hot dog here one night with my Vegas roomie, Cindy C. Oh, and I also ordered myself many, many water bottles here (Aquafina and expensive as shizz).  Let's just say the food kept me alive and more importantly, the water kept me even MORE alive.  Thank you Nosh for being our emergency go-to spot for a quick bite & hydration stop.  Recap of that weekend on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFd8kfiZIJY&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA"}
{"text":"When you are staying at Bally's in the South Tower and get that feeling when you need to nosh on something, this place comes through. Especially for breakfast. The service is quick and the bagels are big and fluffy.  Their fruit cup is fresh and juicy, the coffee is hot and comforting and the sandwiches are pretty good. Especially after a day of partying, gambling, and drinking. Or if you just want a quick start in the morning so you can commence to partying for the rest of the day. It's there for convenience and it serves it's purpose."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service... Good food... Haven't been disappointed yet... My husband and I always get 2 hotdog meals, soda, and fresh fruit... Sometimes soup... Never fails... No matter the time of day... Always coming back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a foot-long chicken sandwich on french bread, and I'm pretty sure the sandwich was 15\" AND HUGE. 3.5 adults comfortably ate that sandwich. Compared to other vegas prices, it wasn't outrageous. And, Ballys is undergoing renovations, so that was the only \"quick\" place to eat. We took our sandwich back to the pool and avoided the steep service fees, plus delivery charges. And the chicken salad was actually quite good with huge pieces of chicken and apples."}
{"text":"Nice and casual eatery with friendly and quick service. Food is good and a great choice if you're on the go and need to grab a bite.    Right near elevators if you're staying at Ballys and that's always a nice convenience."}
{"text":"Got in from the East Coast late...this 24 hr. No frills deli was a hidden gem.  Tucked away in a far corner of Bally's...it was inexpensive and we both ate well...with leftovers...for $12 (total...not apiece)!  Can't do that at home!  Being that it was 2a.m. vegas time, we decided to split a French Dip sandwich with chips and tea...12 inches...$12!    We had a choice of bread and for this sandwich selected the French baguette.  Delish and expertly toasted.  Plenty of beef, horseradish sauce on the side and LOTS of au jus!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The bread is good.......BUT WHO ORDERS A SANDWHICH FOR THE BREAD!  Everything else on the bread is not good.  However, it's convient if you're staying at Bally's.  For Vegas, the prices are okay, so it gets an extra star ; )"}
{"text":"Sandwich combo with 16 oz coffee for $9.00. Sandwich was very simple. Line wasn't very long. Good amount of seating. No ice coffee. That was a bit of a bummer. Overall not bad for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Since we had a show to go to in the next 45 mins, we ate here.  My husband ordered a hot dog and LOVED it, said it was probably the best hot dog he's ever eaten.  Not sure how a hot dog could be so impressive but ok :)   I ordered the margarita pizza on focaccia bread - it was just ok.  Big, pretty garlicky and nothing to rave about.  I only ate the top of it, too bready/thick and the bottom didn't have anything on it.  A side came with the pizza so I selected the pasta salad.  Unfortunately that wasn't good either, my husband didn't like it at all and he normally loves pasta salad.  For the price I was definitely not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is, fast hot breakfast made to order from scratch, coffee and easy food to go. And a friendly and efficient staff. In, out, and happy."}
{"text":"So reading the reviews, I expected a nicer restaurant style of place to eat. It was not. It was a food court style deli almost. The sandwiches were good tasting. I had the French dip and my wife had the Italian. Very good initially but they got heavy by the end. The French dip didn't have enough meat and had too much mayo. The Italian was very good. Overall good enough to eat if you are nearby but I would not go out of your way to eat here"}
{"text":"Perfect to grab a quic bite to eat and rest after walking the strip. Had the prime rib sandwich, very tasty especially dipped in the Au jus. My son had the meatball sub but it was a little dry, it needed more marinara sauce but was fine once he dip it in the Au jus."}
{"text":"We had the Groupon for here. It basically covered two sandwiches and drinks. We did this for breakfast. The sandwiches are made to order. Love it. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The sandwiches are huge. I was full for a long time before getting hungry again. Great value for what we got."}
{"text":"This little sandwhich cafe is located inside Bally's. It's so petite and cute! I really like that it's affordable, open 24/7, and convenient. I originally ordered a tuna sub but they ran out of tuna. It was their only pescatarian option. With that being said, I ordered a grilled vegetable wrap. My order came out wrong. I took it back, and the chef was really really nice about it! It wasn't the best wrap I've ever had, but what can I say? It was vegetables. I'd come back to try tuna, but I wouldn't spend $8 on the vegetable wrap again."}
