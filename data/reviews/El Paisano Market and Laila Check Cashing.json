{"text":"This might be my new favorite store in the world.  If I had gone to school at ASU, my financial support alone would have made this place a goldmine for the owner.  They make a really good burrito, and sell everything a college kid could ever crave, without the mark up. So lucky to have stumbled upon this spot. Thanks, Yelp"}
{"text":"El Paisano's food is great! Would highly recommend the Fiji burrito, it has fresh avocado and pineapple in it! The staff is a great and they know everyone in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Friendly employees, wide selection of essentials, best beer prices anywhere, and that hometown Mom & Pop feel (regardless of your race/ethnicity). Best bodega EVER!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. The burritos are huge and awesome. I had the steak El Paisano burrito, which includes two thick tortilla shells with cheese in between like a quesodilla. It weighed in at 2 lbs, but could have been heavier had I not deleted the rice. And it was really good.  They sell pretty much everything a college student needs to survive.   The guys who work there are friendly and seem genuinely appreciative to have you there as a customer. Great business.   I'll be back tomorrow if I've finished my burrito by then."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place made my freshman years. Despite its appearance, Paisano's is one of the best Mexican food places around. They've got a great selection at affordable prices, and have some of the nicest people servicing you. If you're new to Tempe, you have to try this place"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall mexican food in tempe"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get something to eat! I live a block away and I go here 3 to 4 times a week for dinner. The food is amazing and the customer service here is awesome. Very good selection of alcohol and anything else you would want. Strongly recommend to anyone even if you don't live in Tempe."}
{"text":"These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"They have the BEST \" Fish & Chips'  I have found in Tempe and surrounding areas.  Always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, low prices, great food. The market is clean and the staff is friendly. Food is made quick no matter how busy they are. Definitely a new regular spot for me."}
{"text":"The place is clean, you can see the kitchen. The cook is super nice and the guy @ the register too.  We ordered the California burro and 2 tacos 1 carne 1 pollo.  Gluten free friendly - and easy to sub anything you can't or don't want.   I was iffy about going here because I had only seen ASU  students say they go here on the weekend and they  love filibertos and Taco Bell equally when they're drunk.  Not the same at all there is someone cooking all day and happily doing it."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings and best quesadilla. And that along with their outstanding alcohol prices. This is the place to buy alcohol in Tempe. All bottles are under what other places tend to charge. And you can accrue points also with a card? How you can you beat that? You can't. This is the place to get your late night food n bottles"}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden gem! This is a convenience store with a good selection of beer and they make quality fast mexican food in the store. The chicken street tacos are great for late night. Good portions of very good quality ingredients. They serve 'til 2:00am!"}
{"text":"Literal hole in the wall joint with amazing Mexican street food tucked into a liquor store/convenience  store. California burrito was full of fresh ingredients and tons of flavor. Salsa and guacamole are spicy. Huge portions. Enjoyed finding my favorite peach iced tea!"}
{"text":"Delicious nachos and 4-pack of tacos. I also picked up the California Burrito for later.   Fair prices and they're open late (2am on a weekday).  Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing.  The best burritos I've had, with the best prices.   With the addition of alcohol to the available products, it just makes this place even better."}
{"text":"The food here is not only insanely delicious, but you'll also definitely get your bang for your buck. I order the Philly steak and fries pretty often, and most of the time I can't even get the lid closed because of how much food is in the box. Also, the Trumparito is a hefty bomb of food that'll definitely keep you full, probably for the whole day. They're super fast with the food prep too! I can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Been there more than a few times, but never ordered food.....until now. I stopped in late about 9pm after class one day and ordered a carne asada burrito and drinky-drank to sip on. I saw no other customers, so I wasn't sure if they were still serving food, but one of the guys there said he'll be right with me. I ordered my food and after he was finished cooking the meat, he let me pick and choose what I wanted inside my burrito too.   Well good thing I got there when I did, because when I was finished paying the line was already 7 people deep and bustling with customers.   Service: The cook, cashier and a random worker were all friendly and didn't get creepy vibe at all.. haha  Food: I wish I took a picture before I started but it was huge! I ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day.   This place is good any time of day and not just for those late night after partying food cravings...well maybe that too:)"}
{"text":"This is my go too late night Mexican food place, it can not be beat. I discovered it for the first time buying beer with one of my friends before a party and have been back probably a dozen time in the pst 3 or 4 months. I would highly recommend their tacos as you can get 4 for the price of a burrito, but they are much more food. The burritos are huge however, and the quesadillas are def larger than I was expecting. Happy eating"}
{"text":"Visiting from California saw all the great reviews place didn't disappoint fantastic!!! If you take to go ask for extra hot sauce and forks"}
{"text":"Bigggg f*ing burritos for a very reasonable price.. $6-7$.. best mexican next to ASU."}
{"text":"Tacos and burritos are amazing!!  I usually get the California burrito or 4 tacos, both are awesome.  This is the best and most authentic Mexican food I've found.  I'm lucky that my buddy told me about it, as I usually never would eat at a hole in the wall place(health concerns).  This place however surprised me, it was extremely clean and they have a large selection of beer and smokes. Definitely a go to place for the best Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot cheetos steak burrito from here on 6/13/18 and it was not great. The only extras I asked for were sour cream, cheese, pico, and rice but it seems like they put everything on it and the meat was minimal and not very meat like, it tasted how wet cat food smells. I failed to finish the burrito... I'm good on trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very good food. Reasonable prices as well, you get a lot for so little. This place is a hidden gem. It is so good! I'm always impressed every time I go there. The food is cooked and served fresh. Everything is made to order. I love it here."}
{"text":"This place is sketchy AF but they always have a large selection of alcohol, so that's a huge plus. I've never eaten there but all of the alcohol poisoned frat guys I've partied with enjoy the food"}
{"text":"The 4-pack of tacos was a great deal for the money. The steak was the best I've ever had at a local Mexican joint. The cook called it carne asada but it was more of a marinated, shredded beef that they throw on the flat top to get crispy when you order. I was curious about the chicken but I can't ever not get the beef. Flavorful, tender, juicy, crispy, not too salty or greasy. It's perfect. Then it's topped with mounds of toppings, to your heart's desire. Fantastic, filling street tacos.   The burritos and chimichangas are so massive and intense that I can't ever even eat half. And for the price they're cheaper than half their burritos with half the flavor around these parts. Hot Cheetoh burrito recommended if you're in to that type of thing. The Cheetohs get soggy obviously but it's still a delicious spicy nacho-cheesy mess (and don't get lettuce in it either that's weird). I've also had the Hot Cheetoh Nachos which were both amazing and disgusting. It's just like diving into the condiment bar with a fork and a bunch of nacho cheese and stale, spicy corn chips floating around. It's a ridiculous amount of food and it's only $6.99 (or 5.99 if you order off Yelp).   The dudes who work here are super chill and super fast. Given the neighborhood, there's always tons of college kids inside the cramped store and eating outside at all hours of the day, and they keep the crowd moving. They have everything here, including giant baskets of shooters at the counter, so it is definitely a favorite late-night stop."}
{"text":"This place.. no joke has the best tacos I've had since moving to Arizona! We ordered our dinner through Postmates I got the 4 chicken tacos and he got the California burrito with steak. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"These guys are always awesome hook up the best burritos on earth don't believe come in and take a look especially when you had a hard night drinking come here and ask for el paisano burritto and they do you a favor! I love the guys here they are nice and take good care of you  keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Do you need to wire money to Nigeria while eating a delicious burrito and shopping for a new bong? This is your dream store! Do you need brass knuckles, a digital scale that looks like an iPhone 3 and Carne asada fries that will knock your socks off? Come on down! This place seriously can do everything you've ever dreamed of. The service is top notch. Dine in, carryout, holidays, mornings and evenings. If I could count how many times I've eaten a 5 dollar double cheeseburger while cashing paycheck here it would be a lot."}
{"text":"The \"spicy guacamole\" is too hot. Habanero hot. Too bad it was mixed throughout my food. IThe food seemed fresh, but two bites in, my mouth was scorched and couldn't taste anything."}
{"text":"The tacos here are excellent also the chimichanga Gotta Have It excellent this is not a sit-down type of restaurant is the little store with the Mexican food stand in the back of it"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!! Amazing! Burrito is bigger than my head. I can't believe it. This is the best place ever."}
{"text":"Walked straight in around 9 and nobody else in line! Sweet. The menu was small and I didn't really read over what they had. Ordered a side of beans, carne asada fries, and a quesadilla with carne. The carne asada comes with a side of whatever (sour cream, pico, hot green salsa, hot red salsa, cilantro...)   The green spicy salsa was so good! It was very hot but had great flavor. The pico was decent.   The quesadilla was very good but I'm used to chunks of carne, not shredded carne. Didn't try the fries but the boy devoured them. Both entrees we're perfect for soaking up alcohol but nothing INSANELY good. Now the beans... I got a side of beans and they were so gross. They were undercooked and under seasoned..it was so bad I had to throw out my first bite. SAD.  Customer service was friendly. Will I be back? I'm sure but it is not something I was crave."}
{"text":"Mexican Street Food at is best after a night out. This Place comes in clutch!"}
{"text":"Great real Mexican food joint. Tucked away little spot. Gets pretty packed at night but never takes to long. Chicken taco are amazing! While you are there you can also pick up all kinds of munchies and alcohol. Kind of the perfect stop for your way home after the bar or a party."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They serve food until 4am Thursday-Saturday and 3am Sunday-Wednesday. These tacos are amazing. And you get SO MUCH in them! My friend also got the veggie burrito and I swear it weighed over a pound! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For my short trip in AZ I knew I had to get late night Mexican food, so my friend from high school took me here after hitting up bars on Mill. It seems like these hole in the wall places are always the best. As far as late night food goes, this place was not greasy or frozen like fast food. My breakfast burrito was made fresh and right in front of me. I got mine with eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and red salsa.   Fast service and the employees were helpful. The only thing is they should offer bacon for the breakfast burrito. Is it just me or is having chicken with egg just wrong?"}
{"text":"Best nachos! I was able to put all the ingredients i wanted  and the meat was seasoned really good. They provided fast service. Since i went in my lunch break"}
{"text":"Delicioso as always. Consistent and nicely priced! Try the tacos, or be brave and go for their new \"Trumparito\"."}
{"text":"So this place is not only a food joint but a market that sells just about everything short of car parts.  I'd say the tacos are pretty good not the best but the price and the experience of feeling like you are a part of some food spiritual experience with the Multicultural and diverse clientele Shirleen experience everyone should have will passing through Tempe Shady Eastern neighborhood.  I definitely like the food enough to come again and do recommend the other hipster Foodies."}
{"text":"Great staff, the good is always made fresh. Busy, but in a good way. Cool vibe, extremely fair prices. The Fiji burrito is huuuge and delicious."}
{"text":"I am always in search of authentic Mexican fare in particular tacos and burritos.  At Paisano's I hit the trifecta.  For starters the tacos were exceptional.  Secondly, the prices are very attractive.  And finally, this is a combo market and Taco place. So if one is looking for Mexican provisions this may be the place to check it out.  But I digress. Back to the food. I ordered 3 steak tacos and watched the cook assemble them. The steak was perfectly cooked on the flat top: tasty and tender.  Based on your preference you can choose from a plethora of toppings and condiments.  The amount of meat in each of the open-faced tacos was another great attribute.  They do a lot of takeout business although I chose to utilize one of two picnic tables outside.  I plan to come back to checkout their burritos and other menu items.   Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"These guys are the best. Friendly service and some of the best Mexican food in Tempe. they've got everything too from bongs, to cheap liquor, and cigars. Go here at least once a week for something."}
{"text":"Man oh man! This place is a must go to place in Tempe, Arizona. I loved this place, what a hole in the wall area, but a secret treasure. The Food here was off the charts, and it has brought me back time and time again. Upon arrival, I already knew this place would be amazing judging by the wait. There was a line going out the door, in a place you would never even check twice. The moment one receives a burrito, it's like being handed a baby. Not only is the burrito a humongous in size, but it has a warm comfort to the touch. It is freshly cooked before your eyes and then carefully wrapped in tin foil. The food isn't scolding hot, but at the perfect temperature where the ingredients cool it off for a nice refreshing bite that keeps you chowing down and asking for more. I personally got the California Burrito with Beef. The beef was well seasoned and so were the rest of the ingredients      This fantastic experience only costed 7 dollars without tax, which was relatively cheap for the amount and the ingredients put within it. Comparing this price to Chipotle, this is amazing. I felt that the quality of meat was much better than that of chipotle, along with the amount that was given. Chipotle may give a great tasting bowl, but they charge extra for guacamole, even alone the bowls are less expensive than that of Chipotle. Here they do not charge for the guacamole, it is actually included in the California Burrito.       The place does not look like it would be serving this high quality and tasting food from the street view. Looking at the market from the outside, it looks like a regular bodega convenient store, which is average. I guarantee that once you go inside you see the lines of people waiting at 1-2 a.m. The store has a very city feel to it and reminds me of Chicago places that are very popular such as Maxwell street hot dogs. The Ambience screams quality. It seems that these people are very focused on giving quality food and running the general store. The whole environment is unique, and I have seen nothing like it in Arizona. I feel the only thing that could add to the ambience to make it better would be some speakers with popular hip hop music. This would totally fit the style of service and make the experience even one notch better. Adding the music would make the wait and shopping experience a lot more fun, and I could definitely see individuals dancing to the music while in line because that is just the vibe the place gives. The place does not have any sitting area within the convenient store, but outside there is an area where one can sit and eat, but the food is so good that I usually walk and eat it.      The chefs definitely looked not only like they enjoyed their job, but the hustle life style that the shop provided them. I loved their fast and friendly service. One thing I noticed about everyone working there was that each individual had an extremely nice hair cut and style. These guys looked very professional and kept themselves well maintained, and with that in mind, I completely trusted them to make my food. The service was extremely fast for the amount of people in line, and surprisingly organized. I love this place and definitely make it a spot to visit every time I go out or stay in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place looks uninviting from the outside but changes your mind as soon as you walk in. Stocked to the max on all kinds of everything. cheap alcohol, awesome food. great prices. friendly service.   This place is the shit. I work at a job right behind it and was hooked after the first trip."}
{"text":"It's okay! Compared to real Mexican food I won't give more than one stars. Need to hire more professional people in the kitchen, and speak English."}
{"text":"OMG when you go hunting for that late night burrito look no further. Don't let the convenience store front throw you off, nestled inside alongside the bottles of booze and baseball caps for sale you will find the best little burrito kitchen around campus. Had a California burrito that was amazing!"}
{"text":"If you want food poisoning you should go there. We got so sick the next day after we ate there. the food sucks. Both the burrito and the tacos were kinda soggy. I like spicy sauce but they put a ton of it so it was hard to eat. And the chicken was very dry."}
{"text":"On a campus that prides itself on keeping it's Forks Up, this is the only place that will force you to put then down. You are going to need both hands for these massive burritos. That's right. You will be double fisting your way through the California burrito, the Fiji, the surf and turf... The list goes on and on. I have driven here from the west side many times - passing literally hundreds of other burrito options along the way, mind you - just to indulge on one of these creations. Great people, great prices, great quick service...and don't forget to grab a couple fireball shots for a buck on the way out. I wish there were a 6 star option..."}
{"text":"Service was extraordinary vey impressive business but I'm hesitant about the sanitation of the food. Taste great but watching them prepare my quesadilla and the environment it was prepared in was sketchy."}
{"text":"I eat here everyday.  Taco and more made fresh daily. Staff is great. Large portions.  You get your moneys worth"}
{"text":"I love this place. Open late which is great for late night munchies. The California burrito is FIREEE"}
{"text":"there was a bread bag closer in my tacos!!!! a literal piece of plastic! how can they let that happen?! i will never go back!"}
{"text":"A college student's dream of convenience is here! This hidden gem has everything that you are looking for: Gatorade, Chex Mix, Recreational things college kids do but are frowned upon things, and tacos. Seriously everything. The staff is always friendly and love getting to know everyone. Just don't go alone, it's kind of scary."}
{"text":"I have finally found my place for amazing late night Mexican food! Move over Fillie-B's, I no longer have to tolerate your bland excuse of a burrito.   El Paisano has a good variety of food from fish & chips to burgers to quesadillas. My favorite item on the menu so far is the California burrito, which is up to par with some of the spots in San Diego I used to frequent. These guys know how to serve quality food at affordable prices and even late at night to serve all your hunger needs at any time."}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb. Freshly prepared, huge portions, and delicious, and always served with a big smile. The store itself has a lot stuff available, and the guys who run it are really friendly."}
{"text":"Got the El Paisarito with everything except beans. It's huge (like 2 pounds), and it's only $7.99. The ingredients are good quality, too. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"The burritos are huge AND amazing. One of the owners came out and gave us waters free of charge when we sat outside to eat at night. The service is fast and friendly. I recommend El P's to everyone"}
{"text":"I recently ordered fish and chips delivered from this place via UberEats. Unfortunately, the food arrived with disgusting orange seasoning powder on both the fish and the French fries. This seasoning tasted cheap and nasty and there was tons of it covering the food. It ruined my meal.   I did not know that it was possible to screw up a basic type of dish such as fish and chips. But El Paisano managed to do so. I wonder why they would want to tamper with a classic recipe like that.   I will not be ordering from this establishment again in the future."}
{"text":"Great corner market. Wide selection of beers and cigarettes, amazing Mexican food with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing food, get that bang for your buck. The cooks are super chill, don't let the fact it's a hole in the wall fool you. Everyone knows the hole is wall spots produce some of the best food and this is definetly one of them!"}
{"text":"This place makes the absolute best burritos I've ever had and im from SoCal. Plus they sell booze, bongs, tobacco, beer bongs, condoms, anything you need. Best market in Tempe!"}
{"text":"It's 2 a.m. and you've been partying all night, really just going crazy, and now the party is winding down and people are crashing all over your house, which is all fine and dandy, but you realize one thing--you're super hungry. But what's open at this hour? You don't want to go to Denny's or Waffle House, or Jack-in-the-Box, you want something GOOD. This is the place to be. And not just for those late night munchies--El P's has the best carne asada I've ever had. It's where I go for good Mexican food. Sure, they sell bongs and beer and corner store items, but I'm not about that life--for me it's all about the amazing food in the back."}
{"text":"El Paisanos is the definition college town convenient store.  El Paisanos has everything you can possibly need in college from drinks, alcohol, munchies, and burritos!  The burritos are AMAZING!  They are huge, taste so fresh and are made fresh right in front of you.   If I had one concern about El Paisanos it's that sometimes I feel they just make up the price of items.  There has been many times where I'll buy the same thing but pay a different amount then I usually do.  But hey, this is a sketchy little store right next to ASU so you can't expect perfection!    Try them out!    Return factor- 100%"}
{"text":"This place is in a liquor store. So its food and booze, who know such genius existed. I got the Arizona/California burrito as usual. I got one taste of it and I was hooked. Ok I know its not really mexican food but it's still good. The guy that was there was really cool and the food was ready in less than 5 minutes. You get a choice of what ever toppings and sauces you want.Next time I got back I'll try the other menu items. He keeps the menu simple which is nice. I'm not standing there for 10 mins trying to pick what to eat. It may look sketch from the outside, but this place is legit."}
{"text":"Best store that has ever existed within a 1 mile radius of ASU. They've sold me enough alcohol to intoxicate the entire student population twice by now. Not only that, these guys also have a street-style Mexicali take-out restaurant built-in to the store. That shizz is BOMB and it's not expensive. Nothing here is. They even have good prices on their 420 waterpipes ;)   Go here."}
{"text":"Have heard from several people that this place was the go to for some good, quick street tacos and the burritos were huge. Ordered a burrito to share and a few tacos. We did steak, but the meat was cold and not cooked fully, it was nice to add on all the fresh toppings!!! We also ordered a burrito, that burrito was pippin hot to the touch and was delicious. I will be back I got a brownie, realized when I got home it was expired. A little disappointed by that but even with that I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They are like always open and I love their Mexican ice cream pops & the carne asada fries!!! I've also had their chimichanga, which was good too!  This is a great late night spot :)"}
{"text":"If u r drunk on lemon st., because let's face it who isn't, you must slop into El P for that monstrous caifornia burrito. Your drunk self will thank you for that."}
{"text":"Best burrito in Tempe. If you are wondering what to order, it is all great. I love the torta and fries, the california burrito, the carne asada fries! If you are near campus and want to get some good mexican food for cheap, El Paisano is the place. This place is way better than Filiberto's"}
{"text":"This burrito was so good I wish there was cloning so we can clone the chef and bring him/her to Los Angeles. I know we have a lot of Mexican spots but this was so legit!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some tacos come here. I always get the 4 pack of tacos with everything on it. The tacos taste perfect by themselves but with add some alcohol and it takes them to another level. I literally moved to Tempe to be closer to these tacos. Every single time I have ordered them I've come here I've always left happy and with a full stomach. Plus their service is top of the line. They've got every single alcohol you could think of plus more. Every flavor you want plus a ton of drinks on ice. Come here and you won't be let down"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best places to go for food late at night in tempe great food here"}
{"text":"I am a driver and I consistently pick up people from here.....They are always raving about the burritos and how awesome they are......This particular day I picked up a guy who had a burrito the size of a small football.....it's looked and smelled so good...I asked what kind .....he said it was a California Burrito....it's the best....i asked what was in it....he said Carne asada, french fries, pico, sourcream, cheese, and green sauce......IT WAS HUGE~!   Mind you I would of never bought a burrito with French fries in it but I decided to go in the next night and buy one.....I took it home....IT WAS HUGE~!   I split it in half and hubby and I shared for dinner~!    We were stuffed~!    IT WAS SOOOOOOO FLIPPIN' GOOD~!   I went back 2 more times during this week and it was just as Consistant and as GOOD as the first time....Now I will say I would NEVER have gone in this place if not for the referral.....it's a small store and I didn't even know they made burritos and sold hot food till I went in......This is a definite well kept hole in the wall secret....nothing fancy...very low key....very casual.....BUT DAMN GOOD~!    AND FURTHERMORE I WILL CONTINUE TO EAT MY FRENCH FRIES IN MY CALIFORNIA BURRITO......PURE AWESOMENESS~!   ;)"}
{"text":"The tacos are awesome. The breakfast burrito with nacho cheese is out of control good. The cook is super friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats but was a little disappointed in the tacos. I ordered 4 chicken and 4 steak, but I couldn't tell the difference between the two meats. I wasn't expecting ground meat, and if I knew it would have been ground mystery meat I'll go to Taco Bell next time. Cilantro could have been chopped a little finer, not just picked apart and included the bottom of the stem."}
{"text":"Excellent late night mexican food at a really good price! Especially the flaming hot cheeto burrito!!"}
{"text":"Huge burrito, only $6, they make it the way you want it.  Rice, beans, salsa, cilantro, onion, cheese, lettuce, etc, you can have it all if you choose.  This could be your favorite burrito and it would be mine if not for the carne asada.  Now I'm not from SoCal so I might not know what's good (apparently if I was from there I would definitely know and be sure to let you hear about it) but that's not the carne asada I'm used to - it's unlike steak and it's incredibly salty.  Still though, it was a really good burrito (again, not from SoCal so take that with a grain or two) but wonder what could've been with better carne."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearances dissuade - the food is quick, cheap and tasty.  After our ASU tour we were pretty hungry. This is near-ish to the Moxy for take out.  A chimichanga, four tacos and two drinks can be had for under $20.  The food is plentiful too."}
{"text":"Best restaurant hands down. They are on top of there shot best price best location. I love all the staff. I recommend this place to the whole wide world!!!"}
{"text":"You would never know that there is an amazing Mexican restaurant inside of this store! It looks like a little market with miscellaneous items, but it turns out there is everything inside. I love to get a burrito and my friends love the quesadillas. Such good food along with an awesome cultural experience! :)"}
{"text":"UberEats + El Paisano in the wee hours of the morning is both the single best and worst decision I've ever made.   When you get a call from the Uber driver saying \"I'm here... bring a friend... or a wheelbarrow...\" you know you have a problem.   I'm from Bakersfield. Hi. We know good tacos.   Wait. Surprised? Well, we do. Not to start WWIII here (I'll leave that to our President) but we make some mighty fine tacos in the Central Valley.   So after a long night of drinking, there's only one thing I crave: TACOS!   And at 3 am, there are very few taco options in the fancy little chic town of Scottsdale.   Enter: UberEats.   El Paisano Market (inside Laila's Check Cashing... you read that right) was somehow rated the best of the best. My Tito's fueled-self proceeded to order every single thing on the menu.   You heard me right.   Every. Single. Thing.  To be honest, most of the food wasn't very memorable, but you don't really come here (or order Uber Eats from here) for that. It's the massive portions and the prices. Oh - and the fact that they are open late.   Bye Bye Hangover.   It's hands down one of the more gangster things I've ever done. Think it isn't? Come back to me when you've filled your hotel room with tacos and burritos like a boss. #lifegoals"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and cheap. 4 of us ate for $22. Recommend the chicken tacos and the paisano burrito.   Keep in mind this is a literal liquor and casino store but there are some tables to sit outside. Typical taco truck type situation where you usually order food to go.   Food was awesome, authentic, and cheap. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably The Best drunk/hangover burrito in Tempe! Only have ever ordered delivery but given that, everything has been perfectly delivered. Wish I could get a beverage delivered though"}
{"text":"They have a dude making burritos, pipes, booze, condoms, beanies, and more. They put the convenient in convenience store.  I just wrote their jingle."}
