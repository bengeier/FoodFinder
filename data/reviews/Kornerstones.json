{"text":"good place in scarborough where its decent place for drinks with food and dance , especially on friday nights..."}
{"text":"One of my go to spot for half off wing deals on Tuesdays. Lots of different choices of flavour for wings and are pretty darn good. I recommend the chipotle mango. Service is good during lunch but try to avoid coming here for dinner. It can get really busy and the servers may sometimes forget about you."}
{"text":"DID NOT EVEN GET SERVED! Yes, you read that right. Came with a group of 4, we were all hungry too. Waited 10 min before we got a seat which we did not mind as it was busy. The waitress managed to find a very small table, which looked like it was about to fall apart and stuck us in a corner of the room. We seen her come back to the room several times to serve other people but never came back to our table. We stayed to watch the game and left after."}
{"text":"I am quite enjoying my first experience at this comfy spot. The decor isn't fancy but it's comfortable with its own brand of grungy character. Walked in, was informed to grab whichever seat we wanted which was fantastic. Grabbed the booth by the door. Had a tv right above so my partner was able to enjoy the Leafs game. A waitress came not promptly but in good time.  She qas very friendly and polite. She told us the specials, gave us our menus and took our drink orders. My detour to the bathroom revealed a  clean, well-stocked john. Waitress delivered our drinks, gave suggestions for wing flavours and per request, happily closed the blinds to eliminate the glare. Food is here!!! Nomnom nom"}
{"text":"It's not the classiest or the nicest looking place. Can make do. If you are going to this bar for a night out I wouldn't  really recommend it. But the food is great. I only go there to eat cz it's close by and I work late and it's the only place open other than fast food joints.   Their burgers are pretty good, loved their wings. Spicy chili was very tasty. They have everyday specials which are quite cheap."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just walked up to this place because of the advertised $5.00 burger and fries. Since I had surgery only a few days back, I only ordered water to drink. Can't have alcohol with my meds and do not drink pop. My order was taken without any concerns. After a bit, the waitress came back and told me that in order to get the special, I MUST purchase a drink. I explained my situation and was told, no drink, no special. So I ordered a beer. As I'm eating my burger, I asked where it is written that I have to purchase a drink. The internet menu does not state it, the daily special board in the restaurant does not say so and even the digital advertisement in the restaurant does not say only with drink purchase but \"available all day\". The waitress did not know why or where it is written. She told me to speak with the manager. A lady came to my table and I asked her if she is the manager. She was moot but said it is policy. When asked to see this policy or provide on the advertisement that a special can only purchased with a drink, she got very mad at me, took my beer away (I had not touched it ) and told me this time only I will only be charged for burger and fries. What a stupid place. Will never return!"}
{"text":"Went with +6 people and ordered whole bunch of food to share.  Menu prices are very reasonable with pretty much everything around $10 range.  surf and turf (sirloin steak + lobster ravioli), $15.95.  More on the food later.  Was in on Friday evening and they had a live band -not bad, played everything from santana to bob  marley.  The music was a bit too loud for us but I guess it's kinda our fault since we were having dinner at 9ish.  Most other people were just drinking and enjoying the music.  Food (out if 5)  Nachos: 3.5, not bad but a but thin on the toppings and few pieces were burnt (guess that cannot be avoided) Calamari:4.0 - was pretty good.  Not greasy at all and was super tender. Chicken wings and fries: 3.5-wings were nice and crispy but just a tad on the dry side.  Sauce were pretty generic.  Fries: Costco fries (not necessary a bad thing in my case) Surf and turf:3.5 - steak was cooked to perfect medium well and were slightly pink.  It had authentic charred mark and flavor, however it was lacking seasoning.  Ravioli was perfectly Al Dante however the lobster filling is arguable.  Creamy sauce was \"ohhhh Kay\"and a bit too rich.  It was heavy loaded with generic parmesan.  I guess you have to keep in mind this is not a gourmet restaurant but a bar first and restaurant second.  Whatever that was lacking in food was more than made up in EXCELLENT service, super friendly staff and great (bar) environment."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & a Great atmosphere!    Awesome entertainment throughout the week including Karaoke and 2 of the best DJ'S Scarborough has to offer.  Drinks are a great price and the food not only smells awesome,it's delicious!!    All in all it's a great night out"}
{"text":"Great wings and burgers (you gotta get the home made burgers) and cheap drinks. Really is the go to spot in Scarborough. They also have plenty of TV screens to watch the game."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Burgers and wings are top notch. Especially with their daily specials, its really affordable.   Surprisingly talented singers on their karaoke nights."}
{"text":"Decent local pub-y spot. Very reasonably priced drinks and food in a cozy laid-back sports bar. Definitely gives off the British pub vibe.  I got the fish tacos, which interestingly came with hard shells. The crispiness on the shells and fish tasted slightly stale, possibly because I came with a large group and mine was sitting on the serving table for a bit while they prepared my friends' food. All the food came together which is nice.  They had their own twist to the salsa in the taco, which didn't go well with it. Came with potato wedges, which were hit or miss. Some were deliciously crispy, while others were kind of hard. The accompanying coleslaw tasted a little off. It wasn't a traditional coleslaw, and the flavour pairing didn't go with the rest of the plate.  The food was ok, portion sizes are generous, and drink selection is good. The prices were very good though, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"OK, first I have to say this place is not fancy.  But it is one of those local spots that people in the area go to.  I wouldn't say it is a dive, but the place could use a bit of a renovation.  Having said that, the food is actually pretty good here and they have daily specials which are solid.  Especially their Sunday and Tuesday half price wings which are actually some of the best wings I have had.  If you like to sing Karaoke like I don't, then you can go Sunday night."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, its alright.  The applewood smoked burger isn't anything special even though they make it seem special.  Dark place enough for you not to see the menu and accident order something expensive, marketing scheme.  I had to use the flashlight on my phone to see it.  The karaoke system is way out of date with its songs, like around 2001 or 2002 and earlier.  Mostly middle aged people from around age 35 plus.  Interior looks dark and looks like walls havnt been washed in 7 years.  My recommendation, come here if all original plans have failed, use this place as a last resort or if your significant other has dumped you.  Ratchet level: 7/10"}
{"text":"Visit #1  I wish I knew what the food was like. Been sitting here at the bar for 20 minutes. Haven't been offered a menu. I'm actually very hungry and I did come in for dinner. Bartender is busy sitting in the corner with either off duty staff or regulars.  Laughing it up and slapping the tables. Really wish there was someone serving food though.   Visit #2  Second time in this place. This time I was given a menu... Maybe that's not such a good thing.   I ordered the special of the day. Half rack of ribs and a pound of wings.   Tried to make it simple..  Straight buffalo style wings.   The only thing that was edible on my plate was the coleslaw. Wings are heavily breaded and came smothered in a sweet bbq sauce that compared better with ketchup than buffalo wing sauce. The ribs had the exact same sauce so I think that can just be chalked up to pure laziness.  The ribs ranked among the worst I have been saved. Zero rub...  Zero marinade....  Foul smelling and smothered in low grade bbq sauce. They should be embarrassed to serve that food.    The fries were soaked with foul tasting and smelly grease. Hallmark of a filthy fryer that hasn't been cleaned or had the oil changed in a long long time.   I almost never send food back but this was so disgusting.  I could not eat any of it after a bite or two.   If I could give this place zero stars I would.   Visit #3.   Will never happen."}
{"text":"I namely come here to chill with bar mates and we always have a good time. the bar staff is nice but sometimes overwealmed on sports days but very good nonetheless; courteous and personable. They're willing to have a chat and the owners are super nice. I've been here more than 20 times in the last 2 years and never had complaints. The honey-BBQ wings are fantastic but for once I got their pulled pork sandwich...reminded me of an awesome sauce I tasted in Cleveland so the chef knows his stuff! this is a true watering hole! only minus is the ladies bathroom leaks on occasion."}
{"text":"Had a Christmas party here, the service was good and the food was great! Got a great spot in the dining room facing the big tv!"}
