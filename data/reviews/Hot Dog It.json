{"text":"Hot dog it is amazing ! I've been there about 5 times since it opened recently. I hope it expands and sticks around for a long time. For $4.99 you can get an awesome 1/4 pound hot dog with any toppings you want on it or pick from their menu of pre designed premium hot dogs. They also have fries funnel cakes, and plenty of other sides and delicious things. I've had the poor boy dog and the Kevin Mack attack dog which is my personal favorite. I always bring as many friends as I can to this place. Everyone should know about this great hot dog place. It has plenty of options and can turn hot dog skeptics about hot dog lovers. I really recommend this place. One of the best food places to be in a mall in a long time. He should definitely try to open some more shops because I would go more often if it was even closer to my house."}
