{"text":"It has been way too long since my last visit. The Dublin Lawyer for lunch was excellent. Don't over think it. Just go there.   Not much has changed but there is a nice addition to the beer list. A cooler jammed with a-list craft beers."}
{"text":"Had not been here in 30 years and I was initially very excited until I experienced just how bad the service was.  While it was a crowded night because of the special entertainment, this is nothing new for this Cleveland institution so there is no excuse that I can think of to justify my dampened experience.  I sensed that having to few waitresses to accommodate the crowd was the least of the problem. I can confirm this by my observation of them working, which was dodging game it seemed to constantly and actively ignore customers sitting idle without food, beverage, or food.  I observed wait staff walking pass patrons without acknowledging that they heard them asking for service. I experienced this too 1st hand myself as well during my near :45 minutes idle waiting at my table without a menu, let alone a beverage- both of which had to be asked for eventually, then take another :30 mins. for the ghost-like waitress to finally take the order after having to be asked again. Trying to get eye contact was impossible, just as impossible was getting acknowledgement of our hands waving in the air attempting to get served.  It is disheartening that this tiny standing room only Cleveland favorite which consistently plays host of not to disappoint jazz musicians fails to respect the whole supper club experience.  And, pity that the music was so AWESOME and the it's menu is filled with creative sounding dishes provides customers with service that clearly demonstrates that they simply don't care!"}
{"text":"When ohhh when will this place ever, please, be cleaned and remodelled???!!  UPDATE Sept 2011 - I apparently am the first yelp user to review this place because the VAST majority of the clientele still believe and are amazed that Al Gore actually invented that internet thing."}
{"text":"Please order the eggplant parmesan, you will be sooooo happy you did.  I crave this so often and can't wait until I have the opportunity to go back and order it again!"}
{"text":"My parents have been going here for years, so I have eaten here a few dozen times over the last decade.  The atmosphere is intimate and the music is amazing.  The food, though, leaves a lot to be desired.  It simply does not justify the $20 you will spend on an entree and $10 you will spend on a starter.  This place does not serve fresh, seasonal food, nor does it serve particularly choice cuts of meat.  Rather, you get a static menu of thawed food that you should expect at a chain restaurant.  By way of illustration, we went last week and got the fish tacos for about $18.  This ended up being two tacos consisting of a few scant cubes of fish with a little lettuce, guac on the side, and a small side of beans.  We brought to the waitress's attention that the dish used to consist of three full tacos.  She apologized, went back to the kitchen, and brought out what appeared to be the same dish.  We could have had a better meal at Chipotle for $8.  Nighttown does have a loyal following.  However, I ask that any regulars who disagree with me think about their last meal.  Was the lettuce in your salad a old and wilted?  Were the vegetables limp and flavorless?  Was the meat a little tough?  Also ask yourself why you are paying $20 for a dish that has a non-dressed baked potato - the same one you would get at Wendy's for 99 cents - as a side, when you can go down the street to L'Albatross or Tavern Company and get a better meal for the same price.   Another word of caution - do not let the hostess seat you in the outdoor patio unless it is summer and the open air.  They still use it all year because it can be converted into \"indoor\" seating.  However, it is extremely loud, drafty, and feels like eating in the IX Center.  They may try to tell you that there is a fireplace; in truth, there is a TV playing a fire loop.  I may have gotten carried away.  The food is not offensive, it just isn't good.  If you find yourself in Cleveland Heights go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular and the restaurant is very atmospheric. After you eat you can listen to live music in the back. I wish I lived closer, would eat there more often."}
{"text":"Love this place. The ambiance is wonderful, intimate and relaxed. Fantastic food, awesome cocktails and great service!"}
{"text":"Amazing meals. I had their signature dish, Dublin Lawyer, and my husband had the lamb chops. We were both very happy with the presentation and taste of the food. Service was excellent. The live jazz performance was the perfect backdrop for the meal."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Prices were high (everything was a-la-cart) . Service was lousy. If the server stayed at our table for more than 3 seconds (literally), it was a rare occurrence. When we asked for a tub of butter, sour cream, and horseradish, she would make 3 trips to the kitchen. (She was really hot, though!) The place was packed. People were shoulder to shoulder. On the way out, I asked one of the staff leaders if they were short staff that night. She said no. So, I guess we just got lucky with the server we got! (sarcasm)  For many years, when I walked into a restaurant, I prayed that we get an ugly server! - - - The Nighttown experience hasn't change my prayer."}
{"text":"I had a great time.  The band was nice,  w day very close to the stage and got blasted with sound; be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Why does a server treat a customer with hidden contempt? I don't know. But that is the way I felt this evening after we went to Nighttown to sit at the outside bar and enjoy some good craft beers with a couple of friends from the neighborhood and have some conversation. We were told they didn't have any IPAs. The server rooted through a small cooler naming some miscellaneous Christmas ales, which I chose from with some disappointment. It was only later when we where ready to leave that I discovered they do in fact keep an impressive supply of fine craft beers and have many IPAs in a large cooler that they allow customers to look through and choose from. That would have been fun. I left there having felt that I really wasn't welcome,at least by that server."}
{"text":"My Lady and I revisited Night Town for dinner this evening.It has been 20 years since we have come for dinner. Glad to see no one has lifted a paint brush since they banned smoking.We had the Dublin Lawyer(1 tablespoon of lobster sauce,8 small pieces of lobster, and 3 tablespoons of uncle bens rice all for only $25.00 a plate.The bread they serve with soft butter is GREAT!.Drinks are pricey,but if you are going to listen to a band you have to expect premium prices.They used to be known for good hamburgers,so next time that is what I will order.They have made it 50 years with little support from me so I may try ii again."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I've noticed a variation in service depending on with whom I came.  I ordered the French  onion soup and the cheese on top was burned black around the edge and it was served anyway. I couldn't eat it. When the server took it away uneaten she didn't ask how my food was. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make my service worse."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and menu is excellent variety. Several specials also available.  On Y and I mean only negative is that every time we walk in the bar smells like rancid bleach  Which smells  the other rooms a little  Es.  If you are \"nose sensitive\" to bleach stay away"}
{"text":"nighttown is one of those places that just draws you in.  it's the combination of good music, good food and drinks, and ambiance i think...sometimes it's like you're walking into another era though, as there are not many visual cues to clue you into what decade we're in (besides the new flatscreen at the bar) . oh yes, and it doesn't hurt when it's located exactly 3 minutes from your door.  i'm a big fan of the patio and outdoor bar when the weather is nice, though the inside is nice too especially on a cold snowy night when there's some good jazz playing.  service is great, and they have the best bloody marys in cleveland. i'm a big fan of the sunday brunch, though there's plenty on the dinner menu also. not too pricey either."}
{"text":"I had a private party for my college graduation here about two weeks ago for a party of 15-20 guests. We got there a little early but we were able to have drinks at the bar until the reserved time (for set up). I chose (4) entrees and each of guests enjoyed their meal from the vegan eggplant dish to the prime rib. I personally enjoyed the crab cakes and chicken marsala. The room was nice and quaint. Our server was on top of everything, pouring wine, champagne, bringing out orders she rocked (Thanks Lori!).  I would have a private party here again. I have yet to just have a regular lunch/dinner here each time a celebration so I may be biased in that regard."}
{"text":"There are so many awesome things about this place, here are a few: the dark, private, wood paneled ambiance, the variety and quality of musical acts they bring in, the really great bloody mary's, the lobster mac 'n cheese, the halloumi kabobs, the large outdoor patio, and the service.  Such a classy, interesting, soothing place to be."}
{"text":"I felt a little weird walking in as a jeans & t-shirt student, but the staff can be super-duper cool (shoutout to Mo!). A burger at the bar is $6 and is always tasty. The live music is amazing, and you can sometimes watch the live acts from the TV at the bar. Food and drinks are pricey, but this is still one of my favorite classy joints!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food and the music schedule. Zero stars for the noise and annoyance level during the music. The staff make no effort to keep the doors closed between the concert room and the very noisy bar, even after a few of us walked over repeatedly to close them. There were several tables where people talked in loud voices during the entire performance. If they were there just for the meal and had not paid for the music, they should have been seated in one of the other rooms. Having paid good money to hear great musicians, we were disappointed that the noisy bar and loud tables cut into the experience in a major way."}
{"text":"Great music, but worst service I have experienced in a long time.    Took 1/2 hour to get the drinks out, and then they were warm.   Obvious they had been sitting on the bar for twenty minutes.   Another 1/2 hour passed before we saw salads.   All this time we never saw our server.   Finally, after over an hour, we received the entrees.   Food was brought out by the kitchen staff and the server never even checked to see if everything was okay.   At the end of the night, to add to the awful experience, they added a 20% service charge.   We are never going back."}
{"text":"Went with my wife to Nighttown for a \"without the kids\" lunch on a recent Saturday. We sat on the patio, which was quite nice. Service was a bit slow especially considering there were only a couple of tables seated, but overall our waitress was pleasant, attentive, knowledgeable.  The food was a bit on the expensive side - and this was the lunch menu - but quite tasty. My wife really enjoyed her margarita, which she thought were pretty good size without too much ice. I tried the fried calamari for an appetizer (even though it's not on their lunch menu - they will make it for you if you ask) and it was probably the best fried calamari I've had in recent memory. For my main entree I had the house specialty - The Dublin Lawyer, lobster meat sauteed in cayene butter cream sauce with mushrooms, scallions, and Irish Whiskey served on rice pilaf. Very flavorful and rich, if anything, a bit on the small side of a portion.  My wife had the Chevre Chicken, which was stuffed with goat cheese, shallots and walnuts, and came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. She said she liked it very much and the bite I tried was definitely flavorful. But at $17 for the small lunch portion, maybe not such a great value. Very good food, but as mentioned before, a little on the expensive side for what you get. Will go again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Second visit for us.  (On our first visit last year we sat on the patio and it was a great experience: food, drinks, staff, cleanliness.   This time we sat inside. I can say that the calamari was excellent, but it stops there. Dirty wine glasses, dirty walls, glass on any door in the building = smudged with thick fingerprints. Staff unfriendly, no smiles, no manners... almost like they couldnt see us. Slooooow service. All that ruined it. If it were cleaner, then 3.5 to 4 stars. Plus, a little customer service can go a long way, guys."}
{"text":"The Dublin Lawyer is fantastic!  Prices are high but definitely a unique and fun place to visit."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nighttown for many years.  This is a great place with a nice bar area (fabulous bar staff), a main restaurant that often serves up fine jazz music, and smaller and private seating areas off the bar, and a newer patio that opens up to the stars.  When Cleveland weather is nice, the patio is a wonderful place to eat.  It is good for lunch, dinner, late dinner with music, or just a couple drinks with friends.  Most often now I get the fish, but the steak and prime rib are excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Nighttown after work to meet a girlfriend  for appetizers and cocktails, today and happily discovered they serve 1/2 price appetizers at the bar Mondays and Tuesdays from 4pm-7pm, also they they have house red and white wine for 3 bucks!!!!!!Such a steal. The appetizer selection is fantastic, and there bar is very old school pub style looking, cool vibe. The bar was full of lots of cool people from all different backgrounds. The bartender Ciara also told me that there is a free piano bar on Fridays and Saturdays from 10:30 pm-1am."}
{"text":"I'm trying not to be the proverbial \"food bitch\" but I have to get tonight's dining experience at Nighttown\" off my chest. I have been going to this restaurant as far back as it's infancy in 1964; so, I've witnessed a lot more good than bad. Tonight was possibly the tenth time I have really taken exception to food preparation and quality, and one of several disappointing times that a simple (yikes!) $14.00 hamburger was not prepared close to what was requested. I asked for \"medium rare-emphasis on the rare\" and was delivered well done and dry as a bone. The accompanying fries were a BLAND, tasteless version of the machine extruded kind, with nary a smidgen of salt. My companion ordered his burger \"medium\" and it was closer to what he requested, but nothing great and definitely not the caliber of a 14.00 burger. The rest of our meals consisted of two cranberry juices and a dessert of disappointing carrot cake with an unlikely salty caramel drizzle over cream cheese icing. This travesty merited a bill of 52.00, to which I added a 10.00 tip. Nighttown's kitchen should make some kind of effort to get its act together. I will seriously resist going back!"}
{"text":"Reading other Yelpers' take on Nighttown, I honestly have to wonder if we're talking about different places. I've heard this place called the best jazz club in the city. If that's true, it's a depressing reflection on Cleveland.  I've been here three times, each time mainly for the music. Had dinner twice, and once just drinks. The first time for dinner, the food was above average. The lobster mac and cheese was excellent, the accompanying bread service better than the usual.   The music, each time, was also above average.  And thus concludes the list of good things I have to say about this place.   Let's start with the absurdly cramped dining setup in the performance room. In front of the stage, chairs and tables are wedged so closely together that it's literally impossible to stand up if the person behind you has their chair pushed back. As for space to the sides, there's maybe a foot between each two-top table. This is not an exaggeration. The tables are so close that the first time we dined there, the slightly creepy older gentleman at the table next to us simply inserted himself into our dining conversation.   What's worse, the tables in the front of the room are so close to the performance area (there is no stage, which is frankly pretty insulting to the musicians) that on my most recent visit I stood up from my chair and quite literally nearly knocked the drummer's crash cymbal over.   This is not a place for a date night.  Beyond the lobster mac in that first dinner visit, all the food my wife and I have tried has been subpar and poorly executed. The most recent visit started with clam chowder, which was tasty but probably 10 percent sand. It was so gritty that my wife had to send hers back. Our main courses were worse: My wife's crab cakes were accompanied by ice-cold mashed potatoes. My fried calamari was accompanied by...nothing -- in spite of the menu promising a wasabi-mustard aioli. I finally flagged down our server and noted the omission. \"Oh, it's on there,\" she said.   \"No, it really isn't,\" I said.  \"It's very light,\" she said.  \"It's DRY,\" I said.  So she huffed and puffed and finally arrived with a plastic ramekin of yellowy goop. It was pretty much honey mustard, equivalent to McDonalds' nuggets dipping sauce.   Which brings us to the service. In a word, it's atrocious. During each of my three visits, I was served by waitresses who were beyond surly and edging on downright mean. A highlight from the most recent visit: Informing her that we wanted another bottle of wine, and could we please get a menu to see the list? 15 minutes later she drops off a menu...and then promptly disappears for another 20.   Another highlight: Watching her bring an adjacent table's (very expensive) whiskeys, then stopping to take an order while the poor guys at that table looked longingly at the tray she'd set down just out of reach.   (Speaking of drinks: The place does stock some high-end liquor, but be prepared to pay through the nose. As for wine? I've sampled probably five or six of the selections from their limited list, and each has been simply bad. One glass was clearly on its way to being off, so much that I was prepared to send it back, but then didn't see our waitress for literally another hour.)  The most infuriating thing is that EVERY check has gratuity added automatically when music is playing. A gratuity of 20 percent. Twenty. Percent. Automatically. Is it any wonder the service is crap?   But hey, this is a music space, right? It's all about the music? Yeah, no. The weak food and awful service would perhaps be tolerable if this were actually a good place to see real jazz, but the setup, staff, and clientele all work together to ensure that isn't the case. I've mentioned the fact that there's no stage, which is almost unheard of in any serious venue. Stageless setups are for cocktail parties and dinner music, places where the music isn't meant to be the focal point.   But the place has so many other issues that it's clear that a lack of respect for the music is endemic to this joint. Consider: A waitress clashes through the tables as the band engages in a particularly quiet number, asking -- loudly enough to be heard in the next room -- if people want a refill on their water. On WATER. Lady, it's WATER. If there's room in the glass for more, put it there and shut your gob.   Consider: the kitchen can be clearly heard from right in front of the \"stage.\" Clashing pots, laughing and yelling cooks, irritable waitresses screeching orders.   Consider: several tables full of very loud patrons were completely ignored by service staff and management, EVEN AFTER THE BAND LEADER ASKED THEM TO QUIET DOWN.    And consider: Despite an advertised $20 cover, no one was at the door to take money. That can't be good for the performers.   Cleveland, you can do better. You should do better. This place is an embarrassment."}
{"text":"Okay. A disclaimer. I've only been here twice and have only sat out on the patio, so this review is a bit biased.  Nighttown, I want to love you. I really do. You're charming on the inside and have a great patio. What I have had of your food is pretty good. $5 bar burgers on Mondays are awesome. I had the prime rib once and that was good as well. But your service...it's so bad.   It shouldn't take 15 minutes for me to get a glass of water, or another 20  to ask if I want to order something. I wasn't impressed with the waiter/bartender/busboy who snappily took my order, or the two waitresses/bartenders bitching about their tables as they were making their drinks. Which, by the way, were a bit expensive. Not the cocktails, but the beer. $4.50 for a Corona? Totally not THAT tasty. Everyone looked totally apathetic about working here.  That being said, I'll give it another chance. Maybe things are better on the inside. It seems like a good idea for a place, but...some things are a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Live Jazz on the East side of Cleveland, Nighttown offers delicious Irish-American fare served in a cozy, friendly pub atmosphere. A great spot for a first date, the covered patio has a cool feel on a hot summer day, while the interior is warm and inviting on the coldest winter nights. The food is fantastic and the service stellar. Known for their Dublin Lawyer, Prime Rib, and Lamb Chops, I have yet to find a bad plate on the menu. Fresh Guiness is always on tap and they know how to pour a half and half. Always a good idea to finish up your evening with an Irish coffee and a short walk up the hill to La Galataria. If you are looking for live Jazz, look no further. A true Cleveland Gem."}
{"text":"As you walk into Nighttown you're brought back to what a supper club and bar should be, dark woods, pictures and posters on the wall and a nice selection of cocktails.   As an adopted New Englander I wasn't sure about ordering the house specialty \"Dublin Lawyer\", which is lobster in a whisky cream sauce, but I am glad I did. The dish was well seasoned and served with rice pilaf, which would well at soaking up the extra whisky cream sauce."}
{"text":"I ususally go there for drinks when I'm in town, and that's always a good time.  My family has a tradition of going there for Christmas Eve dinner, and I think everyone walks away satisfied."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere-- so so food.  A friend and I went to Nighttown Saturday night.  Sat on the patio-- nice atmosphere.  I had the prime rib as did my friend and it was just ok-- a little too fatty( nicer presentation if the meat would have been trimmed better.). I also had the house salad which was nice, but nothing special.  The music-- a nice jazz trio was playing and was really good as was the New York cheesecake and the bottle of proseco my friend and I shared.  I suggest going for the music and drinks and dessert and skipping the main course altogether.  Our waiter was good-- not incredibly attentive but in his defense covering the entire patio himself."}
{"text":"This review may be a little biased because I have some really good memories associated with this place. Any of my friends will tell you that I'm so nostalgic that it's borderline annoying. Old memories aside, I'm going to talk about the fantastic brunch I ate recently.   I absolutely love the feel of Nighttown. I'm not a huge jazz fan, but I feel like if I lived in New Orleans I would be...you know, Bourbon St, smokey clubs, the bayou, huge plantation homes with long driveways flanked with willowy trees, vodoo...all that is very appealing to me. When I'm in Nighttown I can almost dream that I might be there. Although, since I've never actually been to New Orleans, I could be way off base!   The food was delicious. The brunch menu is big with plenty of healthy options in addition to some less healthy, but insanely good sounding like lobster mac n cheese. I picked an egg, salmon and guyere (not sure I have that spelled right) cheese. It seemed like a lot of food, but I actually wasn't quite full when I was finished. A few bites off someone Else's plate took care of that! His dish was a simple omelet with spinach and cheese which was also delicious. I had a burger a couple years back and that was great too."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night for a Count Basie orchestra show. I ordered the Dublin lobster lawyer thing. No need to take a picture, as there are already several of them here on Yelp. This dish was fantastic! It was like a whole lobster chopped up on a plate, covered in lobster bisque. Served alongside wild rice at mushrooms, the whole plate look fantastic. I seem to remember reading on the menu something about the lobster being Creole or spicy. It was not spicy at all, but very very tasty.  I asked my waiter for a nice oaky charpenais, he brought a glass out without hesitation that was very good. Finished the night with a pint of Guinness.  The service was decent, but excellent when you consider the obstacle course of people the wait staff had to get through to provide the meals.The venue was fantastic for a small show, which I enjoyed very much. I will be seeking out shows to see at Nighttown in the future"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and music. They always have wonderful special items to keep the menu exciting."}
{"text":"Just had such a weird experience here trying to get brunch. We walked in and got stared at--no, stared through--for 10 minutes before they seated us. Granted, we were here right before they opened, so I'm not counting the other 5 minutes we waited. All we got were brisk \"hi\"s and nothing more.   In the end, we had to ask to be seated...strange, awkward, and not helping a place that I don't really like that much in the first place. We left after ordering drinks and deciding (too late, big mistake wasting our time) to go to the Inn on Coventry for breakfast. Honestly probably won't be back here because there aren't any redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"This is the swanky-ist brunch menu I've ever experienced. I'm ordering the Lobster Benedict and Hubby is getting \"The Famous Dublin Lawyer \" (more lobster ). Friends were swapping tea bags from tea selections they were given  (\"I'll trade you two of my Earl Grays for one of your vanilla chais\"). And Hubby is having his first mimosa  (I just had a sip  - he ain't driving )."}
{"text":"Went to Nighttown for the very 1st time to see a musical performance by Bobby Caldwell ...... the place was beyond crowded - its almost humorous just navigating around this place as you narrowly avoid busboys,servers with food,bar patrons , diners and other music patrons .... its chaotic but in a fun way . Nighttown knows how to get all their customers taken care of ... servers were great -all of them very used to delivering food & drinks through a sea of people . Will definately return .... this place is unlike any other and it is truly a unique and memorable venue to experience great music in a happy atmosphere . See you again , Nighttown !"}
{"text":"We took over the performance hall for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  There were about 120 of us.  Servers and bar staff worked their as$es off to please our group.  I think they succeeded.  Food was good and served hot.  Drinks were made right and served cold.  Valet parking is $6, and there is metered parking all over.  I will have to come back for a show at this Cleveland institution."}
{"text":"First things first: I'm a maHOOSive jazz snob. Play all types, and I can name any Bird or Trane track a sax player is quoting. Luckily so are the folks at Nighttown. They draw acts from all across the board, which is really hard to not only DO but to be able to do consistently. Forget New York, if you want a broad representation of the jazz world, just hang out around Nighttown.  Of course I have to sing the praises of their glorious brunch. Never had a bad experience whether it be bangers and mash or schnazzy pancakes.  The lunch and dinner menus are a bit more upscale and a tad pricier (otherwise, they'd get 5 stars) but just as great and satisfying. The service can be a bit slow on busy days, but I wouldn't call it the fault of the servers.  Atmosphere is probably the best in town. Art Deco speakeasy with some modern flare. Stop by the Cedar Lee for an art flick, then head on down to Nighttown for a fancy feast with some cool bop numbers. It doesn't get much classier than that."}
{"text":"Literally terrible. The food was terrible. We had reservations and were seated in a weird outdoor patio space with giant space heaters. No music or ambiance.   Cold prime rib. Hard rice. Terrible cocktails.   The waitress was nice!"}
{"text":"Have never really had a meal here that knocked me out, but Sunday brunch is terrific and goes until 3. (a must for bartenders. If it went 'til 4 I'd give another star.) The Gran Marnier soaked French toast is mediocre, but seafood quiche knocked my socks off. Pretty decent Bloody Mary. They have a lot of regional and national musicians, jazz mostly, in the evenings...but can't say much as it's not one of my night spots. Extra points for James Joyce coffee cups."}
{"text":"Not so fast...we stIll love this place!  Great food and drink in an old school environment.  Had a fantastic dinner here a few weeks back then stayed for J D Souther. Where else on earth can you do that??"}
{"text":"I have been here for Brunch and Dinner and I've never been disappointed. The dinner was delicious and the staff was super friendly.  I went with a group for brunch and everything on our table was delicious!  The mimosas and blood marys were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Love that it is open late night for food.  Great atmosphere and surroundings.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great brunch. The Belgium waffle hit the spot! Next time i will try their lobster Benedict."}
{"text":"I would give NIGHTTOWN 5 STARS, except for the fact that their service staff has to deal with an overcrowded and slow kitchen.  Their food is outstanding - don;t get me wrong.  Everything is SO DAMN GOOD - it's just that the establishment is SO large (Patio, Two Bars back-to-back, large dining room where the live music performs, smaller dining room, and a private party room or used as an additional dining room on busier nights) that they could probably use twice the kitchen staff, twice the kitchen's SIZE, and twice the wait staff on the weekends.  The menu is mouth-watering and excellent!!  The management is delightful and eager to please.  PLEASE go and enjoy - Brunch, Lunch, Dinner or just snacks, drinks and JAZZ!!  They also OFTEN (especially for special events and dinner hour) provide a valet service for a minimal amount."}
{"text":"Night Town is fabulous! I'm so happy it's just a 90 second walk from my apartment. Their late night happy hour deals are phenomenal with half price appetizers and soups and drinks. Arrive at just the right time and you might catch some live jazz or piano music! Their latest happy hour is from 10:00 to midnight, but the kitchen is open until 2:00AM. I recommend the appetizer of mussels. The deviled eggs are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"We heard word that Spoke, a jazz ensemble that we know from Brooklyn, was playing at Nighttown, just down the road from us, on a Monday night. We got on our bikes, and minutes later we were seated at a table for two in an intimate, dimly-lit dining area just a few feet from the performers, and having another one of those \"wow, Cleveland is awesome\" moments. We really did feel like we'd stepped into a jazz club from another era. Though we planned to order halloumi kabobs, at the last moment we decided to throw mostly-vegetarianism to the wind and get straight to the heart of Nighttown's menu and order the Monday night special of baby back ribs. Oh, they were divine. Hearty food, amazing music, and a fantastic vibe all around made this a great night out."}
{"text":"We went to Nighttown for the first time. All 4 of us loves it. I had the lobster lawyer, fantastic!!!  We also had the mussels, clam chowder and pecan sundae. Everything was exceptional and we will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Gave the place 1 star which was being kind. The food was fair. The prices were a bit high. The atmosphere was loud and we had to ask to move to another room to be able to speak and hear each other. But the worst thing was the overly aggressive flies. We spent most of our time swatting flies and shooing them off our food. And this was inside not on the patio. I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"I went there the other night to enjoy a night out I knew the entertainment was going to be great.    My husband and I decided to order a bottle of wine as the glass price was $10 compared to $34.  I should have had a clue when the waitress unscrewed the bottle as opposed to uncorking the bottle.  The meal went downhill from here.  Ordered dinner while my first choice was not available.  Ended up ordering the halibut which was very disappointing. The food took forever, while I know it was crowded due to the concert but I saw other tables get their food that was sat after us.  First the presentation was good while the halibut looked dry - it was and barely room temperature.  The potatoes which were creative in presentation were cold a little warm as I ate my way to the middle and the vegetables were cold.  I did not finish anything not because the portions were large but I do not like eating cold, dry food.  Rounding out the dinner was the fact that during concerts the gratuity is added to the check, 15%.  Having been a server years ago I can understand the difficulty waiting a table in a venue such as this as the tables are pushed together, hearing the customer can be difficult etc. However, paying this gratuity to a waitress that only came to our table twice, once after serving the food and at the end when she brought the check is not deserving of a gratuity of 15%.  I do not mind tipping a server 15% as I typically tip 20%, if the service warrants it - she did not.  Overall, the entertainment was great but I would never go there again to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely divine. Cozy, old-world vibe but classy and traditional. The food and the service is excellent, and they make the best Bloody Marys I've ever had. A truly one of a kind bar."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day brunch after reading fabulous reviews.  The restaurant was completely packed.  The tables were practically situated on top of each other, leaving no privacy between you and your neighbors.  I'm not sure if the restaurant is always setup in this manner, or if they brought in more tables for Mother's Day.  Either way, this made for a slightly uncomfortable dining experience.  Also, with each table packed, it was quite loud in the restaurant, making conversation a bit difficult.  The food was solid, but nothing to rave about.  The dishes ordered at my table included: bangers & eggs, the belgian waffle, quiche du jour (crab and asparagus), and the Dublin Lawyer.  The quiche was probably the favorite dish of the table as it was simply loaded with crab.  The bangers & eggs and belgian waffle were nothing special at all.  The Dublin Lawyer was well-liked, but was unfortunately an unsatisfying portion size.  The side of fruit served with one of the dishes was very disappointing: a mix of cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple that tasted like it was purchased precut at a local grocery store.  The service was slow, but that's to be expected on a busy occasion.  However, the poor attitude of the staff members was irritating.  I don't think our waiter ever cracked a smile, and the woman refilling the water glasses was downright snippy.  I'd definitely like to try Nighttown again during the evening when I can catch a performance.  I have a feeling that's the best time to pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"not only did this place smell, hair on the floor, dirty plates, dirty cups, badly cooked burger (which should be the easiest thing to cook), oh wait, did I note how badly the place smelled and how dirty everything was?!?"}
{"text":"every time I come to nightgown i always meet new & interesting patrons & musicians.  Music is a standard A+  Food & service is good too. Tip: order pre-performance - it's hard to hear once the music starts.  I enjoy that the food options as they are heavy & shareable - perfect place for date night.  live musicwill most likely be playing so either if you've run out of things to say or a it's one of your first dates - you can sway & listen to the music instead"}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine has been recommending Nighttown for years, and after a recent evening at Severance we decided to give it a go.  The restaurant sits on Cedar Road, and is easily accessible from University Circle. Occupying a labyrinthine grouping of rooms and three separate bars, this Cleveland Heights mainstay caters to an extremely eclectic clientele; Orchestra patrons can be spotted dining alongside Case students, Clinic physicians and neighborhood walk-ins at this well-worn establishment.  A quick perusal of the menu at Nighttown will reveal a similarly unique variety of offerings.  Appetizers run the gamut, from decidedly bar-friendly deviled eggs, to short rib cavatelli and steamed mussels in garlic white wine broth...eclectic, indeed!  I chose the lobster roll and my husband selected the salmon Caesar salad as our entrees.  We were both quite pleased with the presentation and quality of ingredients.  When he requested anchovies to garnish his salad, our server didn't miss a beat and was back in seconds with the salty seafood.  The service was remarkably efficient and adept; our room was near capacity  on a Saturday night. Nighttown features live music, especially on weekends, in an ideally intimate brunch or dinner setting.  Be sure to check their ever-changing schedule of performances if you'd like to avail yourself of some wonderful live entertainment to accompany the delicious cuisine.  Valet parking available on weekends, nightly specials and a marvelous martini menu help round out this Heights hotspot."}
{"text":"Good food great service music is great the beer selection is large I will be back next time I'm Olin Ohio"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Sunday late afternoon/evening around 4:30pm. There was no wait and this was kind of right before the rush.  They have a nice menu with a lot of red meat or seafood options. And a nice wine and mixed drink options. However, it will cost you!  The bread they served while you wait was really good.l and served hot. We both got the Delmonico steak with the blue cheese crust. We had it before and loved it so wanted to try it again.  It was prepared a little differently this time but still good. They added sautéed onions on top and a lot more blue cheese. I didn't care for the onions and felt the blue cheese was overkill. The steak wasn't seasoned at all underneath the blue cheese. It was served with asparagus and garlic mash potatoes and both of those were okay sides. I just didn't feel the meal was quite worth the price.  Also, the service was lacking. Our waitress never introduced herself and really didn't even attempt to be personable. She just kept running back up to talk to her coworkers at the bar."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service I have seen at a restaurant in Cleveland.  With a reservation, we were seated for dinner at 7:30 on a Saturday night with my parents and fiancé.  After apps and drinks we were informed that $80 would be added to our bill because live music was starting and the cover was $20 a person. (Which we weren't told previously) We informed the waitress that we didnt know and they told us we'd have to move to the other side of the restaurant during our dinner as the lights were dimming for the show.  They then told us we would have to wait till a table on the other side opened up. So we stood for 10 minutes and finally decided to leave.  After being berated by the owner and made a spectacle in from of other patrons. It was a ruined night, and the owner of Nighttown has no idea how to do business."}
{"text":"Great music. Good food. Lame service but they know it so they just add 20% wether you like it or not."}
{"text":"Flying under the radar in Cleveland Heights..Had dinner there last night on one of their fab outdoor patios, Place was packed and the atmosphere fantastic We had the pork belly app..Ethereal!, My wife had the Lobster Roll and I had their signature dish Dublin Lawyer. Prices are very fair and the live music was inside and sounded great. The owner showed us around..What a gregarious guy! Been there since 1965 and is getting ready to celebrate 50 years..What arestaurant in Cleveland can say that. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is just an updated review on the music+venue, not the food. The food is still overpriced and not that special (except for the $5 burger at the bar), but the venue is amazing for music! It's based on everything James Joyce, from the menu to the name of the restaurant. The stage is very vintage/ornate with a lush red velvet curtain. Every act that I've seen here has been terrific. We went last time for bluegrass (gasp!) that included a cello, violin, mandolin, and hammered dulcimer. So cool.  Totally worth it for the music."}
{"text":"So I came here with a couple friends to welcome an interviewee.  Nice ambiance, but the service that night was a tad slow.    Nighttown has a very at-home feel, as if, should you go frequently, the waiters/waitresses ought to know your name.  A full bar with old school decor makes for a relatively sedate and tasteful enterprise.    The food itself was fair, meriting a 3-4 stars in the local environment.  Price point was a little high for the quality of food, but not extraordinarily so.  The decor is a bit worn, but this is, after all, a well established venue!  I'll come back again, sometime... especially to check out the live music!"}
{"text":"-Quick Review- Rating: 3.5 stars  Recommended dishes: veal meatloaf, frito misto Suitable for: hanging out with friends  -Full Review- I came here on a weekday night, and here are my thoughts:   //Parking// There is usually valet parking in front of Nighttown for $4 at night. I parked across the street on Delaware Dr, where there's neighborhood parking.  //Ambience// From the outside, Nighttown appears quite small, so I was really surprised by how large the venue is! It had quite a few seating areas- a quiet area right by the entrance, a bigger area next to the stage, and 2 areas close to the bar. There were a lot of quirky paintings on the walls. Quite an interesting place.   //Food// I heard they had really great burgers here, so I was expecting a whole lot of burger options on the menu. Well, there were only two, while all the other options for entrees were pretty expensive. Extremely disappointed by this. I opted to order two appetizers instead. I got the Frito Misto and the Bacon Gnochi. The Frito Misto is a \"flash fried\" dish with calamari, shrimp, broccoli, etc. It was topped with a very tasty orange sauce. Loved this appetizer! I was not  big fan of the Bacon Gnochi though. It was a bit too salty, unfortunately. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's veal meatloaf, which was GOLDEN! It reminded me of the Chinese meatloaves my Mom made when I was a kid, so I definitely LOVED it!   //Service// Service was great! Our server, Jen, was very attentive. Everyone working here seems so friendly and welcoming!  I definitely want to come back and check out the Jazz music!"}
{"text":"Went to an 8:00 show last night by the amazing Joe Sample Trio. We were lucky to get seated just to the left of the piano and that gave a great opportunity to watch Joe play. I've always liked his work, especially with the Jazz Crusaders, and his albums with Randy Crawford. Although he didn't play my favorite, \"Carmel\", he played a solid 1 1/2 hour set. One important tip: for a good show like this, it is a good idea to get there about an hour early as seating is mostly \"first come\" for the smaller tables. We arrived about 7:00, were seated, and ordered our dinners. Although we were still finishing up after the set began, it was still better than trying to order and eat during the set, as the room gets very dark. A second tip is to be sure to pay while the set is in progress. Those who wait until the end will face a long wait, as everybody else gets their bills paid. Now the food: a very nice bottle of Monte Antico Sangiovese....good Tuscan red, paired well with my flat iron steak. My friend had the Halibut, and it was plated over a very delicious risotto with an interesting green pea puree. I know it sounds odd, but it gave it a very \"fresh\", almost minty taste. A final tip is that there is a large lot with meters right next to the restaurant and they have valet parking for a very reasonable $4.00.  Highly recommend!!! A real Cleveland gem!!"}
{"text":"People who give Nighttown 5 stars have never eaten anywhere outside Cleveland.  Yes, the food is decent but not great.  The music is fabulous and this combination of great music and decent eats adds up to a thumbs up recommendation based on Cleveland Ohio standards -- the bar is set a tad lower than let's say San Francisco Yoshi's!"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner or a drink. The halloumi appetizer is must have and one of my favorite things ever! Cool patio that is often closed for private events, but when the weather is nice it's worth the trip. Have gotten a few thing on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. Last few times I was here though they had a wedding going on so it was very loud and the service was slower than usual."}
{"text":"On Saturday October 31,  we had a group of ten to hear Brazilian guitarist,  Diego Figueiredo for the 8:30 pm show.   He was entertaining and appeared to thoroughly enjoy himself. He played with passion ... which was  also fun to watch!  The sound quality was okay... It was more of an  intimate setting. The seating is  painfully close,  so close I got to experience the ear hair on a 70 'ish yr old gent with his date,  practically sitting on my lap.   I  became an  unwilling participate on how Brazilian music makes him feel  frisky again.... uuuugh. But I digress. Ohhhh Okaaay..... Focus. This seemed to become the theme for me during the entire show. There were A LOT of distractions. The bar area next to the concert room was incredibly LOUD. So loud I could barely hear the man next to me plans for the evening.... !    = } FOCUS.... The decor is eclectically designed with an array of memorabilia of bygone eras...   I loved it.  After reading  the reviews on Yelp,  I was not expecting much for service or  food. But I was pleasing surprised. We had a great server named Tony... Excellent!  He handled his business with a certain degree of professionalism.  The food was okay.... price point was in line, temperature was good... There were no complaints at our table. Overall good experience...  One tip to forward:  Leave your ADHD... ADD... OCD... whatever letter of the alphabet you need to insert here  ( and you know who you are)  at the door.  Relax..... enjoy the moment. I had to.... You'll thank me for that."}
{"text":"Night Town was great for my homecoming dinner 10+ years ago.  I went back recently (without my high school sweetheart this time, to be clear) and was very disappointed.  The service was probably the biggest let down.  The hostess and a server elected to wrap-up a fight they were having (no punches thrown) rather than greet us.  Awkward.  Actually, maybe the food was a bigger let down.  I'm pretty sure the menu hasn't been updated since I was in high school.  I mean, we are talking about scampi, prime rib, trout amandine, salmon with dill sauce, etc.  Are you kidding?  How dated - I should have worn my letterman jacket!  The lighting was harsh, the place was freezing - if I recall, they had space heaters set-up in the dining room, very classy - and the dining rooms generally look to be in need of a major makeover.  I've definitely aged better.  If you want to see jazz in Cleveland, this place still offers some notable names.  If you want to enjoy a good meal in 2009 instead of 1999, this place should be avoided."}
{"text":"Food was a joke. Way over priced and not even good tasting. DON'T GET THE LOBSTER ROLL! For $19 you should get more than approximately 3oz of filling that is mostly puréed mush with no flavor. Also, if you like campfires get the \"smoked\" salmon burger. Tasted like a bottle of liquid smoke then cooked over a campfire."}
{"text":"Came here for an event in the back room. I've lived in the area and had yet to come here, so I was pleasantly surprised! The back room we were in was a cool pseudo outdoor area with a bar and a fireplace. The appetizers we were served were tasty and the beers they have on tap are great. The indoor area also looks like a cool spot to hear some live music!"}
{"text":"Go here! It's super cool and yummy brunch! I got the Dublin lawyer! So delicious... was a liiiiittle too creamy that I ended up getting a stomach ache but it tasted so yum. If I was ever back in town I'd check it out at night so I could see some jazz."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Friday night and was delighted to find that the food was wonderful and the staff impeccable. I happened to have a gift certificate from a friend and thus decided to stop by!  At the outset, we were provided with fresh bread and butter.  I started with a bowl of their clam chowder, which was fantastic. Creamy and chunky and perfectly seasoned.  Next my partner and I moved on to the caprese salad. I would say the caprese was pretty standard fare. It had a nice vinaigrette and was well seasoned, but there didn't seem to be anything particularly special about it. In addition, there was a cracker on the top that I felt was mediocre; it was too big and couldn't easily be split because of it's curlicue shape. It felt as if the only option was to bite into it and make a tremendous mess. Along with the caprese came a cooked artichoke that was also delicious.  Finally, for my main course, I had the split pea risotto, which was fantastic. Unfortunately, I was too full to take more than two bites, so the rest came home and will be devoured soon.  Overall, fantastic night, and we'll come back again!"}
{"text":"I got the prime rib and it was so tough, we had a hard time cutting it with our knives. I heard a lot of good things and the experience did not live up to my expectations. I will probably give it another try and explore other options on the menu. Maybe it was just a bad batch of meat idk."}
{"text":"We came in with a tour group, we had a choice of fish taco,  burger, chicken masala or pasta primavera. We had a group of 63 and even though it seemed like the waitstaff was having a hard time keeping up, they were eventually able to serve us and finally get us our drinks.  They had a small Brazilian jazz combo playing, the guitar player was named Moses. We had a great time listening and dancing.   If we were staying longer I would definatly go back to try some of the regular menu items."}
{"text":"This place is either very overrated or the quality has gone way down.   We've been here several times, and our experience has been similar -- rude and poor service (usually with an attitude), mediocre food at best, overpriced drinks, and outstanding musicians. I feel sorry for these performers getting stuck at a place that cannot provide the same level of service to their talents, but there is simply no other music venues for them on the east side."}
{"text":"Mother's Day disaster....  I took my sister and brother-in-law to brunch...we had gone for the past 7 or eight years, but this is the LAST!  The waiter was downright rude.  My sister's Bloody Mary was a lightish pink  color and filled with so much ice, there was nothing to drink.  When she went to the bar to  request another, the person behind the bar kept saying, \"Who is your waiter, you need to speak to your waiter.\"  When, after an interminable wait, he wandered by; the excuse was they had run out of Bloody Mary mix. ...so, I guess they justify that by completely  filling the glass with ice.  She did receive another drink, with less ice, but very little vodka.  We had been seated at a dirty table, waited for silverware and water forever.  Once our brunch order arrived, the food was cold.  The food was mediocre, at best, and overpriced. A request for more bread went unanswered and when my brother-in-law managed to catch the waiter's eye, he was told it would take some time.  The restaurant was very busy, and understandably, the waiters were overburdened; but this waiter was unnecessarily unpleasant.  Patrons seated next to us, a woman and her grandmother were equally unhappy with the drinks served, temperature of the food served, etc.  A remark my brother-in-law made to the waiter about never having received the bread requested was met by his angrily throwing presumably dirty dishes into some kind of receptacle.  A request to speak with the manager or owner was met with stony  silence and we left vowing not to return."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in our service during our first time visit to NightTown. Our waitress at one point forgot we were still sitting at our table. In addition to that, there was no live music as was advertised online. And the final complaint was that they had a tour group/reception come in at 9pm when we were seated at 8:15pm. We were not warned that a giant group would be taking over the restaurant. We had a random elderly couple pull up two chairs to our table and joined my girlfriend and I in the middle of our meal, and just sat there. Extremely disappointed and will not be recommending this establishment to friends or family or coworkers."}
{"text":"Best place for jazz in all of Cleveland hands down. Jazz just as good as the shows I go to in NYC.  Fabulous food too. Get the Dublin lawyer"}
{"text":"So much tradition and a  staple in the community.  Great food, drinks and entertainment.  Steak salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"Avoid the backroom. No ambiance and cold drafts. Inside is nice atmosphere. Food was fine for the price. Had the Dublin Lawyer, and was ok; nothing special like some of the reviews say. We had a group of 6, and 2 of the dinners were brought at least 5 minutes later with no explanation. Off night for them, but probably won't go back unless invited by others."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Great conversation at the bar. I have no idea how the food is since I never got the chance to order.  Grossly understaffed.   We'll keep going just because it's Night Town. I guess that's what they count on."}
{"text":"NO class! Tacky! Rude! Fucking INSANE owner, manager...whoever is the vertically challenged man who handles concert seating.  Yeah, I said it. HIS ASS MIGHT JUST BE MENTALLY UNSTABLE, diversity ignorant or a fucking idiot!  Came for a sold out, double concert and this fool acted like paying customers were the enemy!   I was recovering from surgery and on a cane and when told to go to the back of the building, outside, and wait to be called by number, I shared that I could not stand long and there was nowhere to sit. I asked a couple different times if I could sit at the bar, a table, anywhere...until my number was called to be seated... THIS BASTARD TOLD ME that BECAUSE I ASKED TOO MANY TIMES TO LEAVE!!!  Really...so if I was physically disabled, a veteran with a disability, the elderly, he would tell me to leave?    FUCK HIM, I fooled his dumb ass and sat with friends who realized I could no longer stand .   Thankful for kindness.  Yeah, if I ever return it won't be to eat, drink, enjoy a concert or hang out.  Right ...I ain't given this fool my money ever again !  No disrespect to my fellow Yelpers but this situation had my so livid and seething that expletives were required.  My spologies!"}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception at Nighttown and everything was perfect and all that I could imagine it to be.  From the first time we visited Nighttown through all the months of planning and then having the actual reception, the staff were helpful and very insightful.  I planned my entire wedding from Chicago, and they were very helpful and responded promptly to email and voicemail.    My guests enjoyed themselves and I had a great time. Everyone loved the food. I would totally recommend Nighttown for a wedding reception.  Mine had 55 people, and the main room in the back was perfect for accommodating that number of people.  If you are having a smaller wedding, I would totally recommend them.  Also, they did not charge us for the space, they only charged us for food and alcohol, so it was very affordable and reasonable.    My wedding was amazing!"}
{"text":"Enter Nighttown and you are instantly transported out of cleveland and into another era. Where old timers with silver hair and plaid sports coats sit with their decorated wives and family friends to discuss business matters and reminisce old times. Nighttown brings the nostalgia on, and in the best of ways. The walls are painted with incredibly stylized characters of jazz musicians, old newspaper clippings and other adornments with old-america attitudes.  I've been here for dinner and late lunch a few times (never woke up in time for Sunday Brunch though). But the food is as is the decor: comfy and old-fashioned. You can't go wrong with the pork chop, which was charred to perfection, simple and delicious. The very popular Dublin Lawyer is overrated in my opinion, which consists of lobster over rice drowned in a heavy buttery cream sauce. Nothing special, but not bad by any means.  The food never really disappoints and is always at least \"pretty good\". I find myself going more for the atmosphere, especially on a cold Cleveland evening than for the food. Intimate and cozy, Nighttown provides a romantic setting that is the perfect escape from Cleveland's harsh winter season and I will surely return again this winter  Food: B Atmosphere: A Service: B"}
{"text":"The food is just okay, the drinks are poor in quality & the service is awful. But this sweet little jazz band is wonderful. My sister-in-law requested bread, which was delivered cold as the waitress removed her finished plate of food. I won't be back when in town. I don't need to be treated like you're doing me a favor and allowing me to spend my money on your 'warm' food, bad service & watered down drinks.  But gee guys.......I love the sweet little band. They were a cool surprise!  You really need to pay attention to your reviews though. They don't look so great."}
{"text":"I had been threatening to make it to Nighttown since our return to the area seven years ago.  Last night, thanks to Bill Frisell, I ran out of excuses.  What a great place for music.  Feels like you're sitting in a huge living room in Dublin, and your host and hostess keep your dinner plate and Scotch glass full throughout the evening.  The bar is pretty tiny, and I was tempted after the early show to sit there and listen through the doorway to Frisell's second set.  But some people have to \"work\" in the \"morning\" so I had to leave.  The main room is shaped like a giant letter \"T\" with wings flaring out from the stage.  Instead of the usual tiny cocktail tables, Nighttown provides real dining tables, and also enough room between aisle and table so you're not elbowing your fellow audience member.  Had to try the house specialty, The Dublin Lawyer which, while very tasty was presented \"cafeteria style,\" that is, dumped onto the plate.  The stuffed eggplant marinara was light and still filling, and fried goat cheese with balsamic dates and prosciutto was the smash hit of the meal.  As this isn't a music review, I'll just say that Frisell is a wonder to behold.  The sound system is pretty basic, but the room has a \"warm\" sound; the stage is really just a small fraction of the dining room floor, with tables removed.  What a sheer delight, though, to be in an audience that listens to the music.  (Except that guy RIGHT in front of me, who seemed to be coming in and out of consciousness, who at one point stood up and shouted:  \"Queensryche!\" then passed out onto the house photographer.)  Ran into a few local musicians, there to witness this guitarist who just plays on a whole 'nutha level.  Hard to believe the acts that pack the giant stadia throughout the land, and guys like Frisell are playing small rooms.  Ah, well.  Two guys were walking down the street; one was a musician, and the other one didn't have any money, either.  \"By and large, jazz has always been like the kind of a man you wouldn't want your daughter to associate with.\"  -  Duke Ellington"}
{"text":"When we got married in May we turned to Nighttown for our rehearsal dinner. The staff was so accommodating in the planning leading up to our event. We had a bar dedicated to our party and a private room. Their service was impeccable and everyone loved their food.   The live jazz later in the evening was such a nice touch. Our guests loved it.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced venue for your next large party I'd check them out."}
{"text":"Ok.  This place is really a 3.5.  We went here for Father's Day Brunch and it was good. Not excellent but good.  I had the Bangers and eggs.  The eggs were scrambled and were very tasty.  They came with small diced (why?) potatoes which were soggy and not so tasty.  Also the Bangers themselves weren't for me.  It's the first time I ever had Bangers so could just be a personal preference.  We also got the mimosas which were yummy!  One snafu:  my cousin wanted her steak and eggs well-done but the steak came out bleeding (yuck!) so she didn't eat it.  All in all, I've been to better brunch places, but this place is adequate for your brunch needs.   NOTE: My husband liked his Bangers and mash and wants to go back so there's your second opinion."}
{"text":"Nighttown could be a better place only if they had better servers. We usually take away from Nighttown and also sat there to eat a couple of times. You may have an impression that I dislike this restaurant but all I am going to write is a honest truth, my own experience and actual events. Afterall, I do like this restaurant.  1. Dine in or Pick up? Definitely Dine in is better. Ordering for pick-up can cause you a little trouble. Let's say, out of 2 times I ordered for pick up in last 2 months, it didn't go smoothly. One time, we ordered steamed clams and Bloom'd Burger for pick up. When we got home and opened those boxes, we saw everything was incredibly wrong. We clearly asked for clams over the phone,(because one of my family members have an allergy by eating mussels) but they gave us mussels and also charged us $3 extra for the mussels.  For the burger, all I got in the box was buns, patty, cheese and french fries. There were no lettuce, tomato, kechup, mustard or any kind of condiment. And the burger was $11.95.   As soon as we called them, the waitress/bartender told us that they had run out of clams so cooked with mussels.  Then, why didn't she say so when I showed up at the restaurant for pickup? Not only they did not have a decency to tell us, but also charged us extra $3, which I did not ask for.  Another time when i got to the place to pickup the food, the waitress told me they had run out of the dish... Not again!! really. So my order was not ready.    ***All they have to do is knowing what is available what is not in the kitchen. All they could have done is to take customers phone number to call us back in case like such. It is little too much since I've never experienced such thing from any other restaurants.  Obviously the kitchen staff and the servers are not communicating well and also they are not doing good job at inventory management if they have to tell customers \"we ran out\" so many times every time.  2. Food quality When we dined in the restaurant, it was exellent.  ($5 Burger) They have this burger deal for $5 if you sit and eat at the bar. It is incredibly worth your money. You can even add grilled onions with extra $1.5. (Pancetta Shrimp) is very very tasty, loving this dish, although it is $13 for an appetizer. (Quiche du Jour) is a real mediocre dish. Don't expect an authentic french quiche, because it is not. It simply lacks in basic knowledge of what quiche is. It is big in size, loaded with crab and cheese and its flavor falls flat. This is more as a big cheese egg \"quiche alike\" american tarte. = mediocre. It is not worth of money. (Dublin Laywer) is a very rich full flavor dish. But it is not like they use the best/freshest ingredients. Rice pilaf is \"Near East\" supermarket quality.  This dish is so dreamy creamy and  gets you sleepy like you want to retire for the rest of the week! You can get this dish almost for a half price during lunch and Sunday Brunch instead of paying double during a dinner time.  (Lobster Benedict) on Sunday Brunch is great if you are willing to pay $14 for an upscale breakfast. (Hot Fudge Sandae for lunch) A big dissapointment. This sandae is $7 in a nice restaurant, I expected something great or at least decent. It comes in a regular white coffee cup with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge syrup. That's it. $7? no way.   I like Nighttown. Having $5 burger with beer at Bar in the evening are blast. Outdoor patio on Lunch and Sunday Brunch on a sunny day can be a real joy. It is beautiful and spacious during summer time."}
{"text":"I love love love love nighttown. The food is amazing, the drinks are great. BUT...I am rather disappointed with the Mike Phillips live performance. The tickets were $20...the show started late...he played maybe 2 or 3 of his songs...he talked too much...I would have rathered listen to his CD's in my own house."}
{"text":"Went with some friends and we split crabcakes as an appetizer and they were delicious and hearty as usual. Two of the us had the Dublin Lawyer which is a rich lobser and rice dish always good. I had the beef short ribs, which ive had before, a little overcooked but still good.  My wife had the lobster rissotto which was bland and had no flavor. Another note was there was no jazz music on when we went which was a friday night."}
{"text":"Anytime you combine a fabulous, independent restaurant with amazing food, live jazz music and great company, you'll get a winner. Period.   Nighttown is a Cleveland sleeper-pick that I hold very dear to me. For one, I love jazz. I used to play jazz...a lot. I've been playing music my entire life and it's the one thing I gave up during college (not enough time/money) that I'll always regret. One thing that I'll never lose is my passion for music and it's ability to bring me true happiness.  Nighttown gives me the opportunity to enjoy what I love about Cleveland all at once:  Independent businesses, fantastic cuisine and the phenomenal creatives/ artists/ musicians we incubate.   I learned about this place when I lived in Cleveland Heights and it quickly became one of my favorite spots to park and unwind. It's quiet but energetic, sophisticated but laid-back, dark but warm...amazing. I'm addicted to brunch, so once again, Nighttown was perfect for me. They have some of the best brunch in \"The Land\" and to able to eat on their huge outdoor patio makes it even better. Instead of the typical, greasy-spoon picks, their menu boasts a more upscale feel with a comforting twist.  Service is always impeccable and consistent too. Don't count out lunch or dinner here either. You basically can't go wrong with any meal. Plus, the musicians are typically on at night, so it's the perfect excuse for a late dinner date.   An added bonus for me is that the crowd at Nighttown is always so unique and incredible. I'm the kind of person who likes to put myself in social situations where you never know who you'll meet, but it's always someone really interesting. This is Nighttown for me. Yes, the crowd can get a little 'older' at times, but that has never bothered me. In fact, I love it.  Besides, it's pretty mixed for the most part.   Honestly, get over to Nighttown for some old-school, Cleveland culture. We could all use some once in a while.  I think it puts things in perspective. I mean, it's been around this long for a reason, right?"}
{"text":"Ate here in the back party room for an interview dinner. I did not experience the jazz musicians.  Service - Good, mostly one server who was on point serving about 20 people.  Salad - The right size not too much or little but with not enough balsamic sauce. Average salad.  Prime rib steak - I got medium which was cooked correctly. Overall the texture and quality was not as good as other steak places I've been to. I don't know if it's just Cleveland in general but the steak seemed \"commercial\" and not high quality.  Overall, I'd come back for drinks and listening to music but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"1.5 stars for the live music, and one star because the duck salad is pretty good.  Minus one star because the food is overpriced, and minus 1.5 stars for one of the most insulting service experiences I've ever had.  Here's the email in complaint that I sent (and never got a reply to):  I rarely write emails like this, but I am writing with a complaint - I stopped by Nighttown tonight for the $5 bar burger and half a beer with a friend; a couple of other friends joined me later after I ordered my burger.  I was sitting at the bar, and had just gotten my burger and beer.  We decided moved to the other side of the bar - a table happened to be open near the window, by the bar.  We asked the waitress if it was ok to sit down.  She said yes.  So we sat down.  We were there for about half an hour.  We got the bill, and saw that we were overcharged by a wine and a beer, I have no idea why. I got the bill corrected but then saw that I had been charged full price ($10.75 or so) for my $5 \"bar\" burger.  Would it have troubled someone to have let me know that if I moved, I would be charged $10.75?  My friends would have accomodated me and we would have stood at the bar instead.  What made this especially not cool was that I sat at the SAME TABLE two months earlier and had ordered the $5 bar burger, and been charged accordingly.    As it was, I explained this to your waitress, then the hostess, who was completely rude and unaccomodating.  In fact, I think she told me that I was wasting her time and that it was \"impossible\" that I had been charged $5 for a bar burger at that table.  So first you got my bill wrong, refused to listen to me, and then accused me of lying?  Lady, I'm not interested in cheating you, I'm interested in being treated fairly as a customer.  I find it interesting that your hostess would go to such lengths to upset four customers over $5.  As it was, I paid my bill in full and was fairly generous in my 25% tip given how I was feeling (I'm not rude, even if your hostess was)."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with good music and a great ambiance.  I've been for brunch, dinner, a special event, and drinks.  If it were more within my price range, I would go more often."}
{"text":"I love french onion soup, but I was really disappointed by what Nighttown offered. It tasted like bouillon cubes and I didn't finish it.   This is all I had, so maybe I would go back and give Nighttown another shot with a different meal."}
{"text":"Great service....Atmosphere was awesome..The Jamison Porkchop was the best we have ever tasted..We will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"Very unusual place that doesn't fit into any 'ambiance' description. This is a series of rooms, the first of which looks like a tiny New York City bar, others of which look like a casual bistro, and one of which is large enough to host live music in an intimate setting (while dinner is served). The waitress didn't have a good handle on the draft beer list, but she was pleasant and accommodating, despite seeming a little overwhelmed.   I parents, my husband and I went for post-symphony desserts and drinks. I had the spiked apple cider cocktail, which was curiously served in a pint glass, but it was warming, and everyone else's drinks looked good. The desserts (creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake) weren't exactly inventive but they were delicious. The dinner menu was sort of all over the place and old-school in style, but I'd be interested in returning for a meal one day.   There is a small parking lot behind, which is great to find in a downtown setting."}
{"text":"I love Night town. It's my favorite place in Cleveland to hang out. It's perfect  for a night a of gathering at the bar with their $5 bar burger or a nice fancy celebration at the dinner table with delicious meals. I love the atmosphere and interior of the place. A must try for out-of-towners!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, very nice place to go with a larger group. Very old school cool decor. I'm personally not a fan of Irish food, but there's a couple good menu options. Prices are not too bad compared to upscale locations, service is usually very good. Nice for small wedding receptions, Xmas parties, etc. live music is good, but sometimes the rooms are so packed that it gets a little stuffy and some patrons are a bit pretentious. Bar has only one or two little TVs so sometimes you can have a good crowd & everybody's conversing but usually it's dull and you just stare at the wall. My recommendation for cook staff is to add my only favorite staple of Irish cooking - fish & chips. I always valet, very convenient. I'd give 7/10 if I could, Cheers!"}
{"text":"The hostess was slightly surly ( she also kept chewing on her nails)and the wait staff seemed inexperienced.  No review of the specials, no explanation of dishes and forgot the coffee service  at the end of the meal. The food is not very interesting or appealing and considering it is the premier jazz venue in Cleveland, it is disappointing.  I just expected a more innovative and better prepared meal with an professional wait staff. The music was exceptional."}
{"text":"Five o'clock reservations and we are sat in a three season room on a cold December night. Everyone in the room is dining with their coats on. Service is extremely slow. I think this place is incredibly understaffed. Host was rude when we asked him to turn up the heat and it turns out the heat wasn't even on."}
{"text":"My favorite steak dinner to order from Uber eats . La Frieda flat iron steak affordable and amazing !!"}
{"text":"This has been a tough one to rate.  It has been legendary since the 1980's with its food and live jazz.  When I first moved to the Heights area in 2000, it was one of the first places I visited.  I had a bad experience, came back again to give it another chance and stopped going.  This spring, I went once and was very pleased.  Have returned another time and again was very satisfied.  What turned me off in the past was the feeling that there was a regular, older crowd that was catered to with service and a dated menu.  Things have changed.  Some of the old menu items are still present, but there is a decidedly younger vibe to the service and menu.  The Dublin Lawyer - which is a lobster entree -- is still present.  It's good, but a little heavy.  They have a nice selection of appetizers, salads and soups.  Their clam chowder is very good, with a fresh, home made taste.  Service was attentive, and there is a nice beer and wine list with a full bar.  It still is also a great local venue for live jazz.  There is limited street parking, and a valet.  I will continue to frequent this place."}
{"text":"I'm shocked it took me so long to come to Nighttown and i'm shocked how little reviews there are, except the general customers there are in there low 60s, I would say.  If you don't know Nighttown much, it's famous for it's jazz bands. On most nights, you can pay about $20 entrance fee to enter the 'concert room' where you pay to listen to jazz bands while ordering your dinner. However if you don't pay the entrance fee, then you can sit in the normal 'restaurant room' but still hear and enjoy the jazz music (which I did).   Here's a few PROs and CONs:  PROs-- love the old school atmosphere, the jazz music is pretty awesome, & and food is really delicious (i ordered crab cake and wedge salad appetizer, prime rib steak entree cooked medium), the amount of food is great too.  CONs-- the service was really slow, if you're there when they play music it does get loud to have a nice conversation, the place is just a tad dirty.  Overall, try it out! Because I'll be back for an evening of jazz again."}
{"text":"The patio was nice, the hostess was willing, the waitress was impassive, the food was OK, the beer was OK, the prices were a bit steep, the clientele were as old as the menu, the only thing keeping pace were the prices. The owner is a nice chap, marketing his blarney on a Midwest market starving for recognition. Not a first choice by any means, but not bad either."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend the other day, and it was our first time at Nighttown, despite living nearby for the past few years.  Sadly, we did not make it on a night when music was playing, so I can't comment on that aspect of the place.  Food wise, we got some calamari for an appetizer, I had the Kurobuta pork shank, and we split a flourless chocolate torte for dessert.  The appetizer and dessert were decent quality, though the cake was perhaps a little dry and I've certainly had better.  The Pork dish was a large shank nestled on top of some butter nut squash and brussel sprouts.  It quite good, well seasoned with tender meat, though I may have preferred some additional vegetables to balance out the large portion of meat.  The food is quite pricey, which is probably the biggest issue I have with the restaurant.  The staff were friendly and timely, and the ambience was ok, though not particularly classy/stylish, more like a nice pub of sorts.  I can see how having some live music would create a pleasant atmosphere, so perhaps if I return on a night with music, it would be a better time to reevaluate the atmosphere there.  Overall, it was a fair dining experience, though a bit on the expensive side for the quality.  As other people have mentioned, it might be a better experience to come to enjoy the music and take advantage of the various bar specials that exist, which seem to be priced well."}
{"text":"Great drinks, happy hour and classic menu. Parking is a bit tight, but it's worth it! Seared tuna salad is great!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in to Nighttown I didn't know what to think. I was made aware that it has been a Cleveland staple for a while now. From my first step through the door until the time I left, I was greeted by a wonderful staff and incredible food. The restaurant is locally famous for their jazz club like atmosphere. Almost every weekend there is a live jazz show that you can enjoy with a meal carefully prepared by their talented chefs. I chose the \"La Frieda Flat Iron Steak\" as it was recommended by the waiter. As a steak enthusiast, I was anticipating what twist Nighttown bring to such a simple test satisfying entrée. I was quite pleased with a plate of an 8 oz cut of steak covered with red wine demi glace, and a side of crème fraiche mashed potatoes and broccolini. The service was prompt throughout the night. Everyone we encountered was friendly. Me and my fiancé will definitely be back to enjoy a night of jazz, great food, and a glass of Guinness."}
{"text":"Music and food...what else more does one need at dinner?! Nighttown is the place to be if you want to be entertained and fed. While I would give its food a 3 and service a 2 (I understand that it's hard to serve people during a show, but at least pretend you like it and put a smile on your face), the entertainment gets a 5. This is the second time I've been here, both times to see students from Baldwin-Wallace perform. The combination of talent and venue make for an experience that will give you goosebumps. Dessert for your mouth and your ears! There are tons of shows so there's no excuse not to go. I will be heading back there in the summer--I hear there is a fabulous patio. And BONUS - dogs are allowed on the patio (and I saw a small one in the bar area today too)!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's always crowded and there isn't much wiggle room.   The food is spectacular and the drinks are strong and reasonably priced.   This place is a business casual restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and ask a lot of question.  The place is always clean. The bathrooms are as well.  Food? They've a mixture of everything. From fish to filet. To pasta and burgers. I've never gotten anything bad.   I'll definitely be back. May even host an event there in the near future."}
{"text":"Went to hear an excellent bluegrass duo yesterday, and had dinner there.   Music was great, but food and drink were mediocre.  I guess they strive for consistent  6.5-7.5 food ( on a 10 point scale) because they can.  Have a big following and are busy all of the time.  Meatloaf was bland and green beans watery.  Martini was small and diluted - not worth $12.  Only reason to eat there is the show.  Speaking of the show, the music is great and the crowds are good.  Nighttown should spend some money to improve the venue - and the experience.  For example, we sat along the back wall and could not see the singers.  How hard would it be to put high tops along the wall so that customers paying $25 each for a 1 1/2 hour show can actually see the performers...?"}
{"text":"We didn't actually go into the restaurant. Instead had it delivered by Deliver Me Food (which I highly recommend). The prime rib was fantastic and very juicy. The trout which had almonds and haricot verts was good, but I think the one at L'abatros had a lot more flavor. Next time I will try the famous Dublin lawyer."}
{"text":"So far we've only come here for lunch, or brunch with a toddler in tow. Well, I have only been here on these occasions (my husband has come a few more times than me)  It can be hard to find dining options when you have a small child, mostly because you don't want your child ruining everyone's meal with general cranky behavior. The few times I've come it hasn't been very crowded, and the staff have been great. Even offering my toddler a chocolate biscuit to win him over.  The food is amazing! The fish tacos are great, the calamari with sauce almost to die for, and from what I hear the Dublin Lawyer (Lobster pot pie) is heaven in a cream sauce.   Sadly I personally have not been able to try their mixed drinks, but again all those I've dined here with have had only good things to say regarding the bloody Mary.   The night crowed is there for the drinks and music experience, so if you do have a small child that may be prone to random outbursts, I would suggest trying to go during lunch or Sunday brunch when this is a much more family friendly location."}
{"text":"We had a large table after Church for brunch. A few kids, infant, seven adults... Not an easy task for a single server. She pulled it off. Sat right away. Menus fast. First round of drinks were made properly and quick. Many items on the brunch menu. Food took a bit long for a brunch that was not busy. Server kept a good check on us. refilled drinks. Food didn't come out together... Delivered very staggered. Price was a tad high. Otherwise, all was pretty good. We'll be back for another brunch soon."}
{"text":"I really like Nighttown.  I feel like it's one of those Cleveland gems, you gotta try.  I've been there quite a few times for different meals. Not gonna lie, when I first went there I felt a bit out of place (they have many...more mature regulars). The decor and ambience is kind of old fashioned, upscale.  The new patio areas they built in the back are really nice, I recommend you get a table out there if it's nice out! They have a nice brunch and regular menu. Although, I'll be honest the prices are a little higher than average (it's not somewhere I go to eat at too frequently).  The New England Clam chowder, Dublin Lawyer (maybe my favorite), Corned Beef Hash, Eggs Benedict are all really yummy. They have a nice fully stocked bar with some really good beer choices (Try the Kentucky Bourbon Ale!). The service can be a bit slow, especially if they're busy--but it doesn't take away from how great it is there (When you're there you can tell they have a lot of loyal customers). I haven't been for a Jazz concert yet, but I'm definitely going to one someday!  (TIP: If you eat at the bar you can get a burger for $5 anytime/any day! It's a really sweet deal!)"}
{"text":"The food is great and so is their selection of beer. The restaurant/bar itself looks like it might cater to more of a snobby crowd but that's certainly not the case. The service is quite good but can slow a bit as it can get crowded. Although the food is quite good, it's a bit pricey, however there's always the $5 burger. Also noteworthy as James C. put it is Nighttown serves up some mighty \"fine jazz music.\""}
{"text":"I had to crack up when I read Cara's review.  I, too, am a former jazz musician, having given it up fairly recently, but hopefully not forever.  Nighttown is probably the place that I would call the coolest, neatest, or greatest joint in all of Cleveland.  Maybe not the best, but there's a big difference between being the best and being the greatest.    Nighttown is remarkably consistent.  I have never had a meal that is short of great.  Brunch, lunch, dinner, doesn't matter.  Everything is great.  Nothing (on the menu) is astounding, but that's OK.  You do not go to Nighttown to be blown away by food.  You go to Nighttown to be blown away by history, atmosphere, and music.  And Nighttown delivers completely in these regards.  When you walk in, after you figure out which door to use to enter, you're routed through a narrow 90 degree corner and into the bar area, which is well-stocked with single malt Scotch, ALWAYS a good sign.  The table setup is often odd - three people in an L- or C-shaped booth with one chair, things like that.  Dark colors and well-worn materials are complemented by walls covered in jazz musician head shots and old Cleveland newspaper front pages.  The menu is distinctly English/Irish, but reaches broadly.  I would call the food gourmet without being fancy.  Everything is carefully prepared and served promptly by friendly, professional servers.  7-8 times in 10, when I visit, it's after Church for brunch... either the eggs benedict, which is always perfect, or the bangers and hash, which is a really nice change.  Their coffee is great, as are their bloody marys.  And, the jazz.  There are few places left in this country where you can see this much good jazz over the course of a year.  There are big names, but there are also no-names that will just rock you back and forth all night while you sip a great single malt,  well-made martini, or a refreshing T&T.  If you get the chance to visit during the Tri-C jazz fest, do it.  There isn't a bad show during the whole week, and there are some really amazing ones.  If there is a discussion about Cleveland Institutions, Nighttown simply must be in the conversation."}
{"text":"Brendan Ring and his staff know how to take care of the customer. Great food, great music, great venue! We visit as often as we can."}
{"text":"Nighttown introduced me to the world of Cleveland Cuisine. A few years back, fresh out of school, after landing my first grown-up job and living closer to the city, I was inclined to try someplace different than the neighborhood chain or hole in the wall pizza joint. The place that changed it all was this sleepy ol' Jazz Club in Cleveland Heights....  The character that permeates from the walls inside Nighttown is to be awed at. The Irish Pub influence is definitely well pronounced. The space inside is plenty adequate for a group or perfect for the romantic evening for two. In addition to the main dining room, there's a cozy bar, an all-season patio and private room available for parties of any occasion.   I've since been to Nighttown on multiple occasions. Only once did I stay for the music, with the majority of my visits focused on dinner and/or drinks. All of my meals have been fantastic, especially the Prime-Rib and on a separate occasion, the Lamb Chop special. Entree's aside, the real gem is the soup. Order the Soup du Jour, whatever it happens to be that night. Every time I come here, I make a point to order the soup. It never disappoints.   Overall, Nighttown seems to be an older, more well refined establishment. I'm speaking of not only the typical crowd, but also to the menu and the building itself. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. As another reviewer pointed out, Nighttown is reliable and that term seems very appropriate. They've seem to have found a recipe for success and it works for them and their patrons.   I appreciate the world that Nighttown has introduced me to. It will always hold a special place in my heart. But more than anything, Nighttown served as a wake-up call as to all of the great independently run restaurants, both new and old that I've still yet to explore in this great food-centric city.   Sláinte"}
{"text":"10/24/2015 10:00 show. Never, Never, Never plan to have a dinner night out at this place. Over sold shows, fire hazard and horrible management."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner a couple of times and have been underwhelmed in general. The food is acceptable, as is the bar. The crowd is a good mix of people and they are generally really outgoing and chatty. The place itself is kind of dark, which makes me wonder how clean it is.  Probably won't go back, unless there is a performer I really want to see."}
{"text":"Average at best, my companion and I started the night out with the crab cake appetizer which was uneventful. The crab cake appetizer was just one small crab cake that was very salty to the taste and lacked the necessary flavors. For our main dinners we both had the lobster roll, which again was very salty and the lobster itself was ill prepared and had a rubbery texture. The one good item that they served was their cheesecake which I'm sure they didn't make. If you want to come here for the entertainment, this place is ideal but I would say pass on the food at any cost, plus the food is very much overpriced for what it is. The service was good though."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a previous review that the Dublin Lawyer is the way to go.  Automatice cure for insomnia - you will definitely need a nap after this dinner.  Excellent, friendly service that is helpful but not in your face and not in your conversation.  Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"I have been to nighttown many times, however last Saturday we had a hectic experience. The performance was absolutely fabulous & the servers are top notch. The problem came from a private party in the main room, for teenagers. It was awful, thumping DJ club music accompanied by drunk kids. My boyfriend found a kid in the bathroom with vomit everywhere. This is a venue I can get all dressed up for, and I was disappointed the management didn't weed out that party."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a beautiful patio. Happy hour drinks are priced well, you can have an Old Overholt rye Manhattan for $3.50 I believe? Most of the food is good and priced fairly; the only thing I have been disappointed by was the steak au poivre which had an odd oily sauce that did not resemble a cream and cognac pan reduction."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Nighttown?  Live music...great drinks...amazing patio...decent food.  It's a great place to go for lunch or a fun night out.    Yesterday was the first time I sat and ate somewhere besides the bar or the patio.  There's definitely a different vibe inside, but I like it.    I always appreciate an establishment that clearly lists vegetarian options.  There are always a few things to choose from and they're generally pretty good.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Nighttown. I used to be a big fan of its bar, which is dark, intimate and always a pleasure. Recently, we've been going more for dinner and the food is always excellent. I was disappointed they ran out of their special the last time we were there, but they made up for it by serving a delicious meal.   I would love to go more for the live music, but we live too far and we normally miss it. But, I'm proud to support any establishment that's been such a big supporter of musicians."}
{"text":"Decided to go to night town with some  friends on a cold night, we were taken to an outside heated patio that was very modern and different from the restaurant. We ordered crab cake appetizers 1 large per order. Very good and highly recommend. Clam chowder was excellent. Also ordered the Brussel sprout salad very good as well with nuts cranberries and lightly dressed. Everything I expected. For entrees we ordered the Dublin lawyer which is there lobster entree for $25 I loved it but others found the dish to be too rich. A friend ordered the short rib special a large portion yet over cooked. And  another friend ordered the lobster risotto and they were not happy and said it lacked taste.  Overall we had a good experience and would definitely return. I recommend this place for groups and date night!"}
{"text":"This just reminds me of a place where my grand dad would have hung out when he was stepping out back in the days.  You feel like you are in another time and I really like that aspect of this place.  The bartenders are pleasant and the bar area is really unique with the bar back splitting the two sides of the bar.  I have had a few options on the menu and the food is good, but a bit pricey.  I do love to sit around and overhear the music while I sit at the bar and chat with a friend that lives in that area.  This is one of those places that you want to stay exactly how it is forever and never get any better or any worse...just stay exactly this way."}
{"text":"Loved our brunch. Service was A++. I had the salmon hash. A few people had the eggs Benedict   The banana bread was yummy.  They have a special breakfast just for dogs. Great place to visit if you like to dine with your canine kids."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of character.  It's a really cool little bar.  As a restaurant, it's ok?  The food, at least what I have tried, is decent,  but not great.  The service is good.  It's a classy place that serves food with classy names that lacks quality."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my husband's \"last supper\" the night before a coronary bypass at the Clinic.  Earlier in the week we very much enjoyed drinks at the bar with local family members. On Thursday night at 5:30ish, the place was empty but one side quickly filled up. Service as slow but our meals were good. The special NY strip arrived rare instead of medium rare, but this ain't Ruth Chris!  The trout almandine was heavily covered with almonds but we brushed the excess aside.  The cup (not bowl) of clam chowder was $10 but good because it was not thickened with cornstarch or flour, just the natural thickness from potatoes. The Cesar side salad was tiny and overdressed.  Our dining neighbors received a bread basket but we didn't.  We ordered the special dessert, Vol at vent, described as \"Lemon curd with fresh berries and whipped cream\" for $6. It arrived with no lemon curd and two raspberries and five blueberries. Since our waitress basically ignored us all evening, we didn't see her until she dropped off the bill. The bill was wrong but we couldn't discuss it with her because she wasn't around. So, I changed the amount on the bill and inserted my credit card. She grabbed the folder and took off. She returned with a bad attitude. She claimed \"special desserts are always $8!\" I pointed out the Daily Special Menu that clearly described the dessert as having lemon curd and cost $6. I didn't like her attitude, so I asked her to remove the charge completely.  We spent $90 and were treated badly. (I realize this is snarky, but our waitress dressed and acted like a cougar. She wore skin tight black jeans and a tight sleeveless tank.) our family has many wonderful memories of this place because my deceased father-in-law was a \"regular\". His photo was on the wall for about 20 years. He hosted private parties here too. He is rolling over in his grave now."}
{"text":"Ehhh . . . to be fair we didn't stay for the show, so the music here may be worth extra stars. So this review is only based on the food.  I took my parents here as an opportunity to try out a new place. To start my salad was a bit wilty and the ranch dressing was bottled (ick). We all had the prime rib. The rib itself was good - but could have been a little more seasoned, but the sides were average. My wine a (chianti) was acidy. Service was good - friendly   I am not sure whether we would go back. May be for a show."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the portions were very small for the price. Very cramped space so don't expect to loosen your belt after dinner."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend and her parents. We met the owner who I think was Irish, sweet guy! We were waiting at the bar for 15 minutes because we had requested a specific table and it was being cleaned. We ordered a couple of appetizers, one of them was the hummus which was amazing. I had theories steak and so did my girlfriend's dad. Her mom had the hanger steak and my girlfriend got shrimp. I loved my steak but when I tasted the hanger steak it ruined everything for me. The hanger steak was fantastic! And I will definitely be back to have it."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Very accommodating. Wonderful service. Food was amazing and the atmosphere is one of a kind. I only wish I lived in Cleveland so I could experience the perfection that is Nighttown more often."}
{"text":"Nighttown is my favorite reliable spot.  The restaurant has expanded greatly thanks to Brandon Ring's vision but the atmosphere has not suffered. Live Jazz is what people rave about. I've never been. I have, however, enjoyed countless meals and cocktails, which is just as good as live music to me.  Night town has an unmistakable Irish flair - pints of Guinness probably outnumber all other brews poured. The dishes are expertly prepared and are, above all, exceptionally reliable. Reliable isn't always synonymous with delicious but trust me, I've had \"amazing but unreliable\" before - we don't want to talk about it. The staff makes you feel like a regular even if its your first time there.  Come by for lunch, you might spot me at the main bar with a pint of the black stuff and a bowl of French Onion soup (one of the two best in Cleveland)  When its cold, you'll be nicely warmed up. When its hot, you can cool off on their patio."}
{"text":"I am SO DISAPPOINTED.   Went to see a show (had reservations), cost $20.  That's fine.  Waited 25 minutes-NO waiter.  Waited ten more minutes.  Went to the bar and got our own drinks.  Saw some NightTown manager person and asked to please find our server.  He seemed to listen, but didn't speak to anyone and kept messing with the lights.  The show was wonderful, in full swing now.  Still no server.  Husband went back to bar to order drinks and dinner and was told we would have a server in a moment.  Waited some more.  Finally a frazzled server appeared...apparently only two people were serving last night.  The manager/light adjuster/oblivious guy was standing against the wall, NOT HELPING his staff, head be-bopping to the music. I truly feel sorry for the staff here.  Service was s l o w.  We didn't even get water. We tipped  the server well because we know this was definitely not her fault; she was working both ends of the restaraunt.  We arrived at 6:30 and it took until 8:00 for our dinner to arrive.  The trout amandine was flavorless.  I left it there.  We paid our check and left. This is the third bad experience (in a row) at what was once a fun place to have a romantic night out.  At this point, I think the Velvet Tango Room is my new spot."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said before?  If you love jazz (I do), love good drinks (yep) and love good food (again - yep) then Nighttown is the place to be.  Over the course of the last year we have seen world class pianists, trumpet virtuosos, a French Jazz singer with a Brazilian guitarist and a blues guitarist accompanied by African drummers.  You don't get that at the House of Blues.  Check out the calendar, make a date and go to Nighttown - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So the first thing I noticed about Nightgown was how under-dressed I was. I guess when I heard \"live music\" & \"kitchen open late\" I thought it was o.k. to wear black skinny jeans and an Adventure Time t-shirt. Yeah, not so much. This place is pretty sleek, you guys. Think red walls, framed vintage prints of varying theme, and polished wood fixtures. And the live music in the next room is more sexy jazz than bearded hipster. If you're trying to seduce somebody from out of town this is probably a good place to take them. They also have an outdoor patio featuring brick walls and strategically placed fans which were much appreciated on a sticky June evening. I kind of felt like they could do something a bit more with it, but it was still quite pleasant. NOW FOR THE FOOD! Unfortunately the best I can give the food is a \"pretty good\". I had the lobster roll with sweet potato fries and while I'm not sure I eat enough lobster to give it a super-fair rating, I just sort of felt like it was maybe not the freshest. The fries, though, were perfect. My husband had the ribeye and said it was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned but maybe a little tough for that particular cut of meat. It seems like while the chefs know what they're doing, the product itself could stand to be a little more high-quality."}
{"text":"Very eclectic ambience. Mix between classic jazz and dive bar(yes odd combination...)...but excellent food! I've had both regular meals and happy hour-both delicious. Happy hour is 50% off apps, and $5 house pours which r generally good wines. During the summer the patio is great. Service is excellent. This will def make it on my CLE happy hour list."}
{"text":"Went to Nighttown to attend a Cabaret Benefit on a Sunday October 20th. The service was great! The servers were very accommodating while we were setting up the Benefit. During the show, Plus One and I shared a Beet Salad and Gnocchi main dish. Delicious, I was tempted to lick the Gnocchi plate clean!Highly recommend Nighttown- eat, drink, listen to music and be merry!"}
{"text":"this place is a disaster and should be closed... we went there for mothers day... an hour an ten minutes for food..... an hour and ten minutes... no substitutions either... they were using their party locations which i am guessing belonged to a car place as they had garage doors on them... the location of these was ridiculous requiring people to walk through the kitchen to the bathroom. that is a health violation..I saw who i only guess was the owner ... pick up a table to move it with a white table cloth on it... the table cloth fell off partially on another table and partially on the floor. Do they get a new one..? no it goes right back on the table... disgusting... the owner should be ashamed"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at Fairmount we popped in here hoping for a better spot and we got just that! Our server was totally amazing, as was the wine and food! She made our birthday girl the star of the show which we really appreciated! Apps and sweets came out quickly and glasses were never empty. Thank you again for everything! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just love Nighttown!  It is our go-to restaurant for special occasions and just when we want a good dinner and do not want to cook."}
{"text":"I had lived right around the corner from NightTown for almost 25 years and it was always warm and just so dependable for good food and a place to take out-of-towners...in the 5 years we've been gone what has happened to NT is a sin...I came back for Christmas week and dropped in...Wait staff have no idea of what they are supposed to be or do, leaving guests stranded, standing in the dining room and tables dirty...the bartender was the only one with a clue...then I made arrangements to have lunch with Cle Clinic friends and the only place they would not go was, you guessed it: Night Town...seems my experience has been the standard since the new management has taken over....but I also heard the the Jazz Night is great..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nightown for for 40+ years. It used to be great.  It is still perfect.  Excellent food, service and vibe.  Last night I had the lamb stew which was as good as I make. My son had the chicken Caesar salad and my wife the trout.  Her baked potato was fab.  Every one was happy - draft beers helped!   I could have probably bought a car for what I have spent here over the years but I am happy I came here instead. Don't go if you want fancy, go if you want real."}
{"text":"The food was bland, the service staff was nice, but the food took forever to come out. The drinks were overly strong and not mixed well enough. The patio is lovely but the menu really needs some rejuvenation. I feel as if the average clienteles age has allowed the chef to stick with bland items. He should try some more modern and diverse menu items."}
{"text":"If you sit at the bar, then you have access to a $6 burger+fries special (up from $5 a year or two ago). Which is a darn good deal in this economy. No charge to sub bleu cheese... Fries are pretty delicious, and the burgers are tasty and well-seasoned. Also, they grill their buns ever so slightly... mmmmmm.  I went there once for the Sunday brunch, however: not impressed. Every time we ordered - from the omelet to the fritata - was really plain, no flavor. Like stuff I make at home (ha). So I've shied away from ordering off the full menu since then.  The music, of course, makes the place. It's pricey: you have to buy tickets for a table, and THEN order food and drinks on top of that. BUT you can sit at the bar for free... and order a $6 burger :) The bar fills up pretty quickly though..."}
{"text":"Okay, my husband and I are in town on business with a bunch of other people from his company. Him and I tried to plan a night out tha everyone would enjoy. We decided to do dinner and live jazz. Upon looking up places in town, this place had the best reviews. We looked online and saw there was a musician due at 7:30 on weeknight - I believe it was a Tuesday- and decided to go. We arrived around 8:30 and there was no music playing. We asked if there was still going to be be music, and the lady who say us said he should be there soon. Fast forward 30 mins- still no live music (not eve music playing on the speakers). Our waitress is slow to help us and seems irritated from the get go that we had come. We have a group of about 10  about half of us order food and the the other half orders appetizers.. But we all get drinks. Not only did she get a serious attitude when some f us didnt order a meal (she literally was like 'you're JUST getting a drink and appetizer!?') but she was also slow to bring us our orders.   Finally I asked if there musician was still comin and she responded very matter of factly 'oh no he's not comin' and kinda laughed. I said 'oh... Well we planned out whole night at coming here for music and drinks, it said it on your website' and she just responded 'no, he's not coming' with an attitude. No explanation, not any kind of 'oh I'm sorry' - just attitude. Someone in the party asked if there was at least a radio or something to play music on the restaurant (it's pretty unusual to do out to eat and not have ANY background music) and the waitress kinda rolled her eyes and walked away, but a few mins later there was soft music playing.  It was bad enough such a large group planned their whole night around something that never happened.. But We were all pretty irritated and taken aback by how unprofessional and rude our waitress was. Irritated that not all of us for got dinner, an unapologetic about the false advertisement. I'm sure this place has good reviews for a reason, but none of us will ever be back. The only reason it is getting a 2 from me is because the food was pretty good, but the service was bad enough to leave it at a two."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday about 2pm for lunch. The service was wonderful and the food was DELICIOUS! We both had soup first, I had Clam Chowder and my boyfriend had the French Onion. Our meals was the Dublin Lawyer and I had the steak."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that provides an evening of people watching,entertainment, and great food .  Our server, Eleanor was very capable, concerned that her customers were happy and very personable.  I ordered The trout almandine which was crisp yet moist.  Love the 1960s presentation with the baked potato and green beans.  The prime rib was flavorful, not overly fatty, And the husband rated it \"very good\".  The food was brought to the table in a surprisingly short amount of time. We got a bottle of wine that was great Our experience tonight was a step back in time for my husband as he went to school  in Cleveland but it was entirely enjoyable for me as well"}
{"text":"This place is very unique.....has many different levels and hallways to go through. There has to be about 3 different rooms you can eat in. I went with my girlfriend and it was very pleasant.  I got the 16 ounce steak and she got the Red Snapper and they were both cooked to perfection. Our waiter was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Went before a jazz performance. Sat in the back patio room. Was very nice for our group of six. Large area with a gas fireplace. Warm. Our waitress was very busy. She brought bread twice and filled our water glasses, but was slow taking our order, but we weren't all ready either. Food was very good. From the wedge salad, French onion soup, to the chicken salad, fish tacos, hamburger and bangers with mashed potatoes. Found great seats for the performance, which was standing room only. Great audience. A very good experience. Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Wow, hidden gem. I came here looking for a late late dinner with some friends and am so glad i've found Nighttown! This place is the type of restaurant you find on accident and you wonder why you've never heard of it before. It's older, and you can tell from the interior but the food is good. I split a lobster mac and cheese and glad I did, the portions are large and I don't think I could have eaten more than half. A few tablemates got fish tacos, fresh fish instead of deep fried with fresh sides to go with it, and another got the cheese burger which was generous in size and when they forgot the bacon on top, they more than made up for it. I need to come back for the live jazz and more food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great drink selection, and amazing music.  Being able to stop by the bar after a long day of work and enjoy jazz while having a drink is among my greatest pleasures.  The drinks unfortunately can be a little expensive, and honestly the food I've had here hasn't been excellent.  With that being said, Nighttown is absolutely worth stopping by if you're visiting, new to the area, or just haven't been yet.  Being quite cheap, one can avoid paying the cover charge for a band by sitting at the bar, which I typically do."}
{"text":"I've gone twice for brunch and enjoyed their menu. Lobster quiche was very good with chunks of lobster and spinach. I've had their veggie omelette before which was also delicious. Fruit is Fresh instead of canned or mass produced. Service was friendly. Atmosphere is a little strange, it is dark and intimate but not upscale. It's probably more of a dinner jazz environment than a brunch but I still will go again for a brunch get together."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to review. Why? Well, the experience was pretty mixed for our group. One thing we all agreed on--make sure you aren't seated outside (in the winter)! We made reservations, expecting a nice meal in the very cool restaurant. When we showed up, we were ushered to their converted outdoor-now-indoor area with plastic tables and only one other group. It honestly killed the mood of the group. The service ended up adequate. Everyone had mix reviews of the food: the salmon is highly recommended; the meatloaf is worth skipping. In the end, it just wasn't the classic, Cleveland experience we planned. Here's to next time!"}
{"text":".The meal was great though. I had the La Frieda NY Strip- I'm the difficult customer... asked for it medium on the inside and charred on the outside. Perfect. Another in our party declared the Bay of Fundy Salmon excellent. Seemed like an older crowd and although we were there on a Saturday night, the service was meh to below-meh."}
{"text":"Most of the time, I've found that high prices=good service. We paid an arm, leg, and eye at Emeril's Restaurant, but in my mind, it was worth it. Why? Because the service was stellar yet non-intrusive.  At Night Town, there are high prices and bad service. Sounds like a losing combination to me!  I have no idea where all of the profits generated by the high prices go...certainly not into hiring more wait staff, or giving the one or two members of the wait staff that are on duty at night a bonus for friendly service!  The food is good--my hamburger was quite good and well worth the $10 I paid. That's the one item on the menu that's exempt from being viewed as too expensive. I ordered a beer, and while I certainly wasn't expecting some $3.50-$4.75 type of special, the darn thing was $15.00! No wonder they didn't list the friggin' price in the menu...had I known it was that much, I definitely would not have ordered it. My buddy ordered a chicken dish that I had ordered on a previous trip to the restaurant, and had I remembered that it was pricey yet very small, I would have told him to skip it.  Maybe the beer was so big because they were hoping that the buzz generated by the beer (it was 9.0% alcohol actually) would distract me from the fact that we saw our server once every full moon. Seriously, we waited long stretches of time in between each course, and the waitress (whose picture is next to the word \"snippy\" in the dictionary) didn't even check back from time to time to see if we were OK. At an upscale place like Night Town, one expects a bit more face time than that! Additionally, one member of our party didn't even receive the dessert beverage that he ordered.  This place has a lot of potential--the outdoor deck is quite nice, and the food is good--and with better service and lower prices on some stuff, it would be a great restaurant. As of now, if you're in the Cedar-Fairmount area and you're considering eating at Night Town, you're better off eating at The Mad Greek, where the portions are bountiful and the wait staff friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for their $5 bar burger.  It was really good.  Food came out quickly and the bartender was nice.  Good portion burger and a lot of fries."}
