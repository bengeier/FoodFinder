{"text":"The indie coffee passport  brought me back here - I had been when it was Barista Espresso Bar - and I quite liked it. My large soy latte was really yummy.  Honestly it might have been a mochaccino because it tasted very chocolatey and that's a bonus as far as I'm concerned. The baristas were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was pretty laid back. I'd come back for another latte like today's, and next time I'd check out the panino too."}
{"text":"I came here as a part of Indie Coffee passport 2012 (ICP) and only had the cappuccino so this review applies to that drink only. This place has changed its name so it was but unnerving that the place on ICP had disappeared. I had to call in and confirm where they are located again as the phone number is still the same. This is more of a sandwich and grab quick bite kinda place and coffee/espresso seems to be a more of an additional service. The setup is OK however the service needs a lot of improvement as the cashier after taking my order was busy chatting and socializing with the other clients rather than making my drink. Anyway on to the drink itself: Espresso: Medium Crema': OK Milk: Frothed poorly Latte Art: N/A. A poor attempt at a cappuccino IMO and for an Italian spot they need to be elevated to much higher standard. Other things I noted that the person making the drink didn't clean the milk nozzle before or after use so the milk was actually scalded on the steam pipe. The ground beans from the previous shot were also left in the porta filter. While I am not expert in making espresso drinks (I would rather be on the drinking end) this is a big no no as far as I have read and seen. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"I just happened by this place because it just opened. I have had Veal sandwiches in liberty village before and they were typical liberty village expensive with a extra side of attitude and bad service, but Panino & Co. stand out on all counts.   The person at the counter was friendly and outgoing.  The place was clean and the menu was simple. I had the veal sandwich and it was awesome... fresh soft bun with tender veal. The sandwich is $7.35 and I had a pop too. Great place great food fair price. I am going back today!"}
{"text":"In the heart of Liberty Village, Panino & Co. was previously known as Barista Espresso Bar. However, the name was not changed on the Indie Coffee Passport this year so I heard from others who had difficulties finding this place!  Originally a cafe for 52 years in the owner's family, competition arose when Aroma Espresso Bar opened nearby, forcing for a concept change. Transformed into a popular lunch spot, Mike the owner, received great response. The coffee sales went down every since Aroma, but the food sales went up. Having visited the restaurant previously last year when it was still known as Barista Espresso Bar, I thought the change was great. The overall layout always felt more like a restaurant where people would come out to eat a hearty sandwich on the marble tables, rather than just drinking coffee alone.  I do note that while I was there, there was no coffee menu nor a station to obtain your sugar and milk. There were not many coffee options, just you basics such as a latte or an americano.  All they had available was sweetener and sugar for your coffee. Therefore, I would not recommend people to go here for a \"cafe experience\" since it's no longer a cafe but rather more suited for a lunch drop-in."}
