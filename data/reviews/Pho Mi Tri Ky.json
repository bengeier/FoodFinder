{"text":"Ordered Pho.  It comes out piping hot as it should be!  The flavourful broth is a delight to the tastebuds and  the prompt service keeps me going back for more."}
{"text":"My favourite pho in the city.  Consistently great broth, very affordable.  Good fast service."}
{"text":"Did the place change it's name to Pho Huong? Got take out from this place today and it was ok.

I had rare beef vermicelli soup and veg spring rolls. The soup wasn't as flavourful as other Pho places I've been to and the spring rolls were oooozing with grease. I won't go back."}
{"text":"ok so this place must have changed its name to Pho Huong, because i did look for Pho Mi Tri Ky and it was no where to be found. 

Decided to visit from the good reviews here and the fact that it is somewhat in my neighborhood. Had pho and spring rolls and it was amazinggggg. So glad I found something close by to cure my pho fix, which happens more than often now."}
{"text":"Great value for money! tasty, healthy food, with hardworking waitresses."}
{"text":"Had a vermicelli \"bun\" bowl today and it was awesome! The spring rolls are super good, it was fresh and fast. Also under $8 for a full lunch. 

Free tea!

Service is perfunctory but fine. 

I dig it."}
{"text":"Apparently the place changed its name to Pho Huong. 

There were some tables outside. The day was warm and sunny, I had done my groceries and was starving, so I decided to sit there and have something tasty...

... ok, after 5 minutes I had to enter and ask for a menu. I hate when this kind of thing happens. The waitress said a zillion of \"I'm sorry\", and served me a glass of water instantly. Ok, I took a quick look at their menu and decided to ask for the shrimp and mango salad. 

The salad deserves its own paragraph: it's basically a mango sliced with some seasoning (I smelled some mint),  two -  I said TWO -  small shrimps cut on halves (I believe this is a strategy so they seem four instead of two) and some greasy fried pastry. You have a salad. Hooray for salad. As I was starving and had been grocerying, could have been the worst thing on earth and it would still look awesome. But definetely I've seen better salads in my life. 

I had to go back inside to ask for my bill after finishing the 2-shrimp-salad. Thus, I decided they didn't deserve my tip. Obviously I'm not coming back. There's a café next door, if you're feeling hungry on the Junction, don't think twice: skip Pho Huong and try the café."}
{"text":"New name is Pho Huong.

The food is great!  We usually order take-out.  We have tried dining in on many occasions but the service has been consistantly bad so we now stick to take out.  Our friends have the same complaint."}
{"text":"The food here got so much better once Pho Mi Try Ky became Pho Huong.  Not sure if it changed ownership but I remember eating here back in 2009 and not really like it.

Now Pho Huong is our regular neighbourhood go-to place for cheap, fast comfort pho.  The large pho comes in around $6.95.  Vermicelli dishes range around the $8-$9 mark.  You really can't beat the price.

Service is alright, generally we know exactly what we want so we order right away and the food comes not too long after the order.

Street parking is available although we usually just park in the No Frills lot next door."}
