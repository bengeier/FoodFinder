{"text":"Finally had something decent to eat at the Great Wolf Lodge. Grits. They were good. In fact I had two servings because it was the first and ultimately the last hot food I was served during our stay."}
{"text":"Its largest positive is that it's located conveniently within the Great Wolf Lodge. The food is on par with most other breakfast buffets if its type. There were periods where we went several minutes without seeing our waitress and had to ask other personnel to meet our needs (drinks, etc.). There are so many other options (many within walking distance of the resort) at Concord Mills that one needn't adventure far to find good eats."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was really good!!!Lots of different things to choose from.Very fun for the kids, if you are staying at GWL make sure the kids bring there wands with them ,there is a few areas they can use them in there :)My family will definitely be eating there again the next time we visit!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there during Thanksgiving weekend. The restaurant was clean and somewhat chaotic. They had an omelette station and delicious breakfast buffet. We were sad promptly and our server was very kind and courteous. The normal type of breakfast foods were available. It may have been a bit overpriced, but it was part of the great Wolf Lodge. It was easy and convenient and we would do it again."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and had a good experience. The breakfast is buffet style with a fruit bar and omelette station. The staff mostly make sure the drinks are filled and the check is given/paid. The food choices included home style potatoes, hash browns, eggs, French toast, cinnamon like rolls with icing, biscuits and gravy, grits, bacon, turkey bacon, sausage links, pancakes, pineapple, melon. I would say look to spend about $13-$15 per person average. Honestly this place was better than the lodge next to it, mostly due to being self serve style."}
{"text":"Nasty! Nasty! Worst way you could possibly spend your money on food! Go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"After my dinner experience here on Saturday evening, I'm certainly not surprised at their low rating!  Now, maybe I can help lower that even more! For $26+, two adults and a five year old got to experience a pretty small Buffet at GWL!  The prime rib was completely dark grey all the way through it on both trips to the carving station.  The vegetables were decent, but only after you added some salt/pepper for seasoning.  The broccoli soup was absolutely inedible!  One sip of the soup was all anyone needed to push that away.  The Mac was so cheesy that it created a paste in your mouth with each bite.  The salad bar is decent, but I'm thinking that's because they aren't having to cook anything!  Oh, and you want something besides water?  Pony up, as that's not included!   The look of the restaurant is done well, as is the whole complex, but there's no reason that these Vegas styled resorts can't have good food at Vegas style prices!"}
