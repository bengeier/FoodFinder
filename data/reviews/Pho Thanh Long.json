{"text":"Oh I'm so happy there's a pho place near me that Isn't on spring mountain!! Not that there is anything wrong with spring mountain,  but i like to eat pho when I'm either sick, drunk,  or hungover,  and navigating the wild driving on spring mountain can prove overwhelming when you are slightly impaired.    So they just opened and are tucked into a little hole in the wall in the kindof ghetto Smith's on Maryland and Karen.  A true mom and pop place,  because mom cooked for me and pop took my money.  Lol.   I ordered the basic rare beef pho to go.  They were super fast and the food was amazing! Great quality beef,  fresh veggies and super tasty noodles.  I'll be one of their regulars for sure as the proximity to my house is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered to-go. The fried rice taste great, Rare steak and well done brisket pho taste great. Will come again since this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant. The pho has more brisket than expected which is an obvious bonus. Can't wait to try the other Pho and rice dishes"}
{"text":"Quick & friendly service with delicious food! Not only is the location great since there aren't many Vietnamese places in this neighborhood, but the food was excellent. Pho broth was flavorful without being too salty. The grilled pork in my bahn mi was marinated well, but all the veggies were fresh. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the nicest server/owner. He's a sweet guy and he tries his bed. The food is really really nice too. I got the vermicelli and he gave a good portion. The pho my friend got was super big as well. The Thai tea and black coffee was . Definitely try this place for good food, good people, and good vibes."}
