{"text":"Great place to take a first date to impress her. Very stylish and open. Enough room between tables. Great drinks martinis and food."}
{"text":"Great local collage bar.  Great food."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Not great music but overall I'm a fan. Ok music is fine I just don't like live music personally but I can't ding them for that. Server was great, wings are huge."}
{"text":"Staff often as attentive as possible. Place often too loud.  As a paying customer was asked to leave after only one drink because someone I knew quit working there that night. Obviously not interested in a quiet patron. No reason to return."}
{"text":"I went there twice. The second time the bartender remembered what I was drinking the first time I went there & offered to make it for me again. I of course said yes & tipped her well for this great display of service. :)"}
{"text":"Great little place to hang, get a bite and listen to music.  The food is really good for a bar...better than \"bar food.\"  You can tell they take pride in what they do.  The staff is super friendly and quick.  Great drinks, great food, great music, great service.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"First-timers this past Saturday... nice place, great live music, LOVED the Espresso martini...and I don't drink martinis. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Nice decor,  never packed when I go which is a good thing.  Bar Maids are really nice and do a good job.  They need to beef up the menu."}
{"text":"My mom was in town and wanted to go out and do something fun. We started At Cornerstone Brewery (first time in) ..beer was flat and drinks were awful. We had intentions of ordering food but the drinks were so bad we decided to leave and try to find somewhere else. Our first time strutting Front St we found 107! WHAT A GEM!!! Instantly we walked in and the place had great energy, didn't SMELL like a bathroom, greeting staff, karaoke and a warm setting! My mom immediately said \"I want to stay here!\". Great prices, staff and establishment. We will definitely be back soon! ****** thank you 107"}
{"text":"Jessica and Shania always treat me like royalty. They have reasonably priced beers, exceptional food, and live entertainment. Not to mention they have an open mic night every Wednesday which is fun for amateurs like me. Keep up the good work everybody"}
{"text":"Just not impressed!  Boring atmosphere and I hear the new owner was rude to my friends. BW college bar with no extras!"}
{"text":"Would've been great except for the fact that the staff was rude. The atmosphere was cool. Love the lighting against the wall color. Bar is well stocked and cocktails are pretty good. But the staff, manager mainly, was beyond rude while the band was playing. Making a scene about how bad they were even though everyone there loved them!"}
{"text":"Bar 107 always hits it out of the park! It's great to be able to enjoy the best in the local music scene and still be catch the end of the Indians game.  The seasonal food and drink menu means there's always a new thing to try. The cocktails are literally crafted with with hand muddled fruits and select herbs and spices. -  My favorite sit-down and enjoy the evening place!"}
{"text":"Just went to hear band and had nice time.  The service and food were very good!  Nice surprise!  Went with friends Susanne, Mark & Bob to listen to friends band"}
{"text":"Quaint spot. Bartender was friendly and their drink menu has some really yummy speciality cocktails. We got chicken tenders which seemed to be freshly breaded and seasoned well. We ordered a make our own pizza and The toppings were plentiful, but the crust was just ok. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items and cocktails. They also have live music on the weekends which I definitely want to check out as well."}
{"text":"I made the trip about 30 min. away because Rich Spina was hosting open mic.  Was I GLAD.  I loved my cider and grilled romaine salad.  Regulars told me to try the wings next time, too.  The music was wonderful and quite a variety of players and genres being open mic night.  The layout isn't overcrowded.  There is regular table seating, bar seating and high top table seating.  There are TVs to watch if you want to.  Convenient restrooms.  Easy parking.  I'm glad I found this place in beautiful Berea, OH just down the street from Baldwin Wallace College."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The cocktails are second to none!! The Chai Iced Tea, and Spiced Pearson Collins are my favorites!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. It is so great to have such a friendly place right around the corner.  They really bend over backwards to give you what you want. I love their flatbread pizzas.  The BLT flatbread is to die for.  Just a  great friendly place with great food where everybody knows your name. How can you beat that. Try it you will love it."}
{"text":"A girlfriend suggested we meet here for cocktails and girl-chat.  It's near home and I'd been meaning to try it.   The atmosphere is nicer than I would have imagined.  The wait staff was great.  And the food was the biggest surprise.  The menu is upscale pub grub, creatively executed and worthy of frequent returns.  I was initially thrilled to have a fabulous local treasure.  That is.........until midway through our meal the incredibly loud live music began at 8pm.  In California, where I come from, we're just sitting down to dinner at 7:30pm.  You expect to talk, then as the evening wears on have music & dancing added at around 10pm.  From the moment the band started we could no longer hold a conversation (which is the reason we were there)  OMG!  It was soooo loud!  It was early.  The place was nearly empty.    A few people at the bar, and a few at another table.  There was NO reason for them to be blasting the music so loud. The lack of customers made the place an uncomfortable echo chamber.  I'd like to suggest to the owner, during the 8pm to 10pm hour (or, 7pm-9pm?), either have a live pianist or jazz trio play.  Isn't the BW Conservatory of Music across the street?  I'm sure you could find a never ending combination of musicians willing to showcase their talents from 7:30pm-10pm nightly.  Keep the volume low.  The student musicians would probably participate in exchange of one of your wonderful dinners & 2 beers.  They are music majors, looking for recognition of their talents, stardom, or at least growing an audience for their musical talent.  I think it would be an absolute win/win for you all.  Heck, make 5:30pm-10pm a 'Dinner Hour Showcase', an event you can advertise.  New musical talent for your dinning pleasure  =)  Most successful restaurateurs realize dinner music, til 10pm should allow people to TALK OVER IT.  If you want to sell dinners, then play dinner music.  If you want to be known as a rock n roll bar (which I love) but don't expect to have a big dinner crowd with the rich Boomer's in the area.   Ahemm...... the Boomer's would love to have dinner at your place, but not if the music is so loud we can't converse.  And besides, when the music starts at 10pm and many of the boomers flee, you're flipping the tables, ready for the drunken college dance crowd to settle in.  Please don't continue to force your dinner crowd to go elsewhere because you're blasting the live music too early."}
{"text":"Food was overcooked and the waitress didn't really seem to care. Kinda of got the vibe it's for drunk college kids, I'd pass there are alot of better places in Berea  It's a flaming bag of garbage, take your hard earned money somewhere else"}
{"text":"This is a great bar with great service. The owner is the biggest sweetheart around.  The have the best peanut butter shot and the only one around! The bartender Shaina is also one amazing woman!  Its doesn't get any better then this when it comes to friendly people and also good drinks and good!  I love there flat-breads as well!"}
{"text":"Love this bar!  Jessica, the owner/manager was working when we stopped in and she was great. Very friendly and attentive. The foot was perfectly prepared and delicious, even for my picky husband.  Now, I saw some Google reviews from people upset they were kicked out of the bar....and they were underage. Well, it clearly states that you need to be 21 to enter  so I'm not sure what the crying is about. I wouldn't risk my business either...it's just too dangerous anymore.  So all the being said, I highly recommend this bar to all and will definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Under new management!  They have recently made the switch to carry all fresh foods and no frozen stuff.  I have never had any complaints about the food and the staff is really friendly.  The one time I ever had a problem they fixed it, were very apologetic, and even took the item off of my bill.  I love when they have bands there because they are always amazing!  The atmosphere is very relaxed and simple.  Definitely a little treasure!  I highly recommend the espresso martini!!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a fun find this was. Too bad I had an early flight because on Wednesday nights they do a unplugged mic night for musicians. The place is cozy and full of regulars, but unlike a lot of your regular type bar patrons these people were AWESOME. The IPA selection was nice and there are plenty of beers to choose from but the reason I will come back besides the ambiance is the fresh food. Don't get me wrong, this is strictly bar food but their ground meat is all fresh. Their apps are good and their chicken wings are large and very tasty. I walked out way to early but was stuffed and had the best service from the bartender named Shanna (sorry if that is spelled wrong) she was super friendly, had good recommendations and while squeezing their own fresh fruit for drinks didn't seem to bothered by the new guy.  I will definitely be back."}
