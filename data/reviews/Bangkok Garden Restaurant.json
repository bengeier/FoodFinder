{"text":"Restaurant recommended by the hotel. Really didn't come in with high expectations and it was quite average. The papaya salad was alright and the shrimp curry was alright, too. Service was really good."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, awful service.  Our server looked disgruntled as she took our order - I would be too if I suffered under this management regime.  Fortunately she rarely came by after that.  We order the mango salad, thai basil beef, and lobster stir-fry.  The mango salad was mushy - we ate half of it and the server took it away (without asking if we wanted it removed, or how it was).  The thai basil beef was lukewarm in termperature,  not as spicy as advertised, and tasted like poor quality beef.  The lobster stir fry was mediocre - likely frozen lobster tail, but for $45 we didn't expect too much.  The thai \"sticky\" rice we asked for was in fact just jasmine rice.  The service was terrible: no one checked in on us AT ALL, i had to go to the bar to ask for another glass of wine to wash down the basil beef, I had to go to the bar to ask for the bill, I had to go the bar to PAY the bill, and when I mentioned to the manager that this was a terrible experience I got a shrug and \"Okay then\".  Yes, I know it's a tourist trap - but there are many better places for thai food (e.g. Khao San Road) and service (e.g. any sports bar).  Go across the street to Adega or Oro or the Queen and Beaver.  I eat out 20 out of 21 meals per week at all kinds of places - I don't expect a heck of a lot for a $110 meal for two, but they managed to stagger under the bar."}
{"text":"The last time I was here (almost 2 years ago), I would've given this restaurant a solid 4. I have re-visited very recently, and I can see why it is below average now.  Food quality has gone downhill a lot. Not sure if it's the quality of ingredients, the chef, or a combination of everything. Some dishes actually taste like cheap \"Chinese\" takeout now!! Like cheap stirfry taste with no exotic Thai flavouring. I swear my stomach got slightly upset after I ate here, and it's never happened before.  The interiors - although still decorated - is getting old/worn and may need a facelift soon.  These are the reasons why this place is a \"3\" now, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ate the lunch buffet and tried most dishes. Salty and not much flavour. Pad Thai tasted like sweet and sour noodles.  I've been to Thailand, and I've tried many Thai restaurants in Vancouver.  Bangkok is really just mass-produced salty greasy north American \"Thai\" fast food."}
{"text":"I've been going to and ordering from this restaurant on and off for 20 years. I remember it was the first Thai restaurant that I ever went to as a teenager with my parents. It used to be the best and most authentic Thai resto in Toronto. Sadly, the quality of food and service had declined over the last 10 years.   Recently, I received an email from them asking me to fill out a survey in exchange for a 20% off Dinner coupon. I thought I would give them some feedback and try them out again. I ordered take out for my family and I.   When I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my order I handed the server, who was going to take my payment, the coupon. He handed it to the manager. After taking a minute and reading the coupon thoroughly the manger informed me that it was only valid for dine in. I advised her that that was not what was mentioned in the coupon. There was no statement indicating that the coupon was dine-in only. She took a second look and then repeated herself, \"Dine-in only\", without providing any justification. At this point I said \"Thank You\" and left without my order.  I didn't want to engage in an argument over the blatant misrepresentation and false advertising. I am very surprised at this kind of customer service in this day and age. There are numerous other great Thai restaurants in Toronto with far better Thai food and much better service. I suggest avoiding Bangkok Garden at all costs."}
{"text":"In spite of the rain last Friday, my inquisitive mind and insatiable appetite for Thai food insisted that I tried this place with all the conflicting reviews.   AMBIENCE  Upon entering you have an impression you left Toronto and went to an exclusive tropical hotel lounge. As the courteous staff guided me towards my reserved table, you can't ignore the captivating gesture of the minimal Thai art deco and the grandeur of the cozy space. The wooden chairs and granite tables harmonize with the huge bell-like lamps. A small pond with colourful coy fish located near the dining tables provide a sense of tranquillity. I have chosen to seat at a table with better vantage point, it's great to know that a small soft pillow is provided on the long couch. The mild and gentle background music sooths well with the elegant furnishings.   It's particularly funny that the restrooms are located one level below. A patron needs to use the stairs and pass through all the doors. It's like playing in an elaborate labyrinth searching for a hidden treasure. Fortunately, there are visible directions to guide you. Looking at the bright side, this is a form of exercise to burn those calories.   SERVICE  Pass 12 noon the influx of patrons are increasing and noticed the following:  1) More patrons are forming a longer line on the buffet banquet  2) The buffet dishes are quickly diminishing which needs to be replenished  3) Most of the tables are left unattended and the used plates are not cleared since most of the staff are helping to replenish the food   It's understandable that tables need to be cleared for the next patron, but the manner in which you clean makes a significant difference. It was both shocking and surprising that the waiters were cleaning the granite table besides me; quickly spraying and wiping with their white cloth. No patron wants any spray mist contaminating his or her food. Understandably, the waiters meant well and doing their job diligently, but this actually happened twice, one on my left side table and a few moments later, on my right side table...I was caught in between. It's an unfortunate and peevish encounter that no patron needs to endure.   Just as suggestion, your waiters can be trained to be discreet and effective at the same time. Have them oppositely face the eating patron while clearing the other table. Their back is behind the person, so they won't contaminate the food with their cleaning spray.   A personal thanks to Britwin Diaz, who promptly ensured that I received the replenished Thai Chili Seafood. Tip of the hat to Ali, he delivered a superb service on my table. Always ready to serve with a smile and  enthusiatically answered all of my queries.   FOOD  (Please see the attached pictures)  On the Buffet banquet, the tidy covered food warmers add more mystery on the dish.  I started with Fresh Spring Rolls, Mango Salad and Thai fried Rolls.  The Fresh Spring rolls almost looked like a simple California rolls, but it's actually bean sprouts, bean curd, red pepper, lettuce and parsley wrapped in soft and smooth paper rice. I relished the way the rice melts in you mouth while biting the crisp vegetables.  I enjoyed the shredded firm mango mixed with parsley, red pepper, shallots and grind peanuts.  The Fried rolls are crunchy yet not oily. I intentionally avoided the Thai sauces that goes with the appetizers; so as to taste its natural flavor.   I reveled with  the 3 Pagodas, the zucchinis and carrots are fresh and firm. It goes well with the mildly spicy coconut milk. Likewise, I enjoyed the Thai Omelette. The savory bean sprouts mixed with eggs are tasty and not salty.   The Tamarind Beef deserves a special mention. The tender beef compliments with the roasted peanuts, potatoes, tamarind and coconut milk.  I liked the Chili Seafood, a combination of the sauteed mixed vegetable with the mildly spiced tender shrimps.   The Thai Street Noodle Bar is fully organized and tidy. I tried the chicken breast with, coriander, chives, garlic and roasted nuts poured over with chicken broth. A perfect warm soup for a rainy Friday.   For the price of the Lunch Buffet, I have expectations that were not met:   First of all, I have enjoyed other versions of Pad Thai in Asia, New York and Toronto. I was expecting more on what Bangkok Garden has to offer with this local staple food. It took me another plate just to determine what seems to be lacking. The noodles are a bit saggy; there are no sufficient eggs, and no bean sprouts (apparently finely cut cabbage was used as a substitute). Also, it taste less tangy and has less spice.   Second, it's unfortunate and surprising that they are not serving any fish or squid on that day.  Third, the Thai Noodle is too dry and not tasty at all.   I have just tried their Lunch Buffet and fair enough to give them a benefit of the doubt. I would like to have the opportunity to try their dinner menu and experience what they have to offer."}
{"text":"I have only been to Bangkok Garden for lunches so cannot speak to the quality of food and service for dinners.  Lunch buffet is always hot, fresh, and delicious. Food is replenished quickly and I have never had to ask to have my water glass refilled or plate cleared.  My favourite is the soup bar that sits parallel to the main buffet. It's a clear broth with the choice of adding noodles, shredded chicken, fish cakes, shrimp balls, and about 12 different kinds of condiments - sugar, chilis in vinegar, green onions, garlic, salted daikon, chili flakes, fish sauce, etc. I always ask for all the condiments. The salty, sweet, hot and sour flavours, along with the warm comforting broth really hits the spot.   The decor is beautiful as well if you want to hold a celebration/event there.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. Great food, good ambience and service with a smile. Only drawback is that tables are too close leaving little room for a private conversation."}
{"text":"Their Mango salad is my fav. This restaurant is great for special occasions, great atmosphere, friendly server and good food. It's a little pricey but for me it's worth it. I usually get the dinner for two which is star of Siam $62.95. If you like mild curry the three Pagodas chicken curry is the best choice. And after eating you can go for a walk, its close to Yonge and dundas square."}
{"text":"I went there for winterlicious and the food was watered down and bland flavour-wise. With thai food I always expect a party in my mouth and the food there was more akin to a funeral.   I don't think that I'll come back. Maybe by chance I might try the buffet but I would not go out of my way to go there for thai food.   I would give them zero stars for the food but the service was good so I thought that they at least deserved a star."}
{"text":"Bangkok Garden was recommended by a friend for the lunch buffet and i decided to check it out. It was a very disappointing experience.  The buffet had a lot of vegetarian items but most of the vegetarian items tasted and smelled like  sea food. Some of my vegetarian colleagues couldn't eat it because of the sea food taste in their food.  The food wasn't filled fast enough and every time you go get some food, some of the containers were empty.   It took over 45 minutes for them to cook a batch of Chicken Wings to be placed in the buffet. Wonder if the chicken they had ran away or something.  I would have rated it to a 2 star but giving it a 3 for the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  Must Try: Cassava Cake, Noodle Soup, Chicken coconut curry"}
{"text":"Great location, I entered this place only because I was craving some great thai cusine..and that i did receieve. Food was great i would definetly go back, staff was alright, we did wait abit longer than expected for our food however I enjoyed the food very much that it didn't bother me that much. Location was perfect especially after spending the day at elmwood spa it was nice to just walk next door to eat."}
{"text":"Watered down Thai food. I don't mind non-authentic Thai food in Toronto but I was very disappointed with today's buffet lunch 'cause nothing had any real flavor. If I wasn't reminded by my colleagues, I swear I was eating some bland version of the fairly mild Cantonese cuisine. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My second trip back to Toronto (once again, to see Eddie Izzard, this time in girly-mode at the end of his Canadian tour) was a quick one-night turnaround.  I was staying at the Delta Chelsea Hotel around the block, and this was pretty much on the way down to Massey Hall, and I love Thai food, so my friend and I chose to give Bangkok Garden a try.  Glad we did!  I had the Demon's Dare .... I just kinda fell for the name, but it was very good, nice and spicy as I tend to like.  Can't remember what my friend had - a chicken dish, which she liked and I thought was quite good as well.    Service was good - came when he was needed but didn't hover.    I would definitely go back if I end up in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week.  We had to go to the Eaton Center and after looking for some place near Dundas Sq. that was less commercial than the big chains and not in a food court, we wandered down Elm St. and found Bankok Garden's outdoor patio.  Elm is a nice quiet street and the restaurant is located in and surrounded by historic buildings.    We had the Thai-licious menu, which was $25/per person for appetizer, main, and dessert.  The portions were appropriate and we didn't leave stuffed.  We started with the Green Papaya Salad (which was good, but had a very potent dressing) and the Spring Rolls (one fried, one not).  We each had Pad Thai.  Mine Veggie and his Seafood (with shrimp, scallops, and squid).  The Pad Thai was average.  The presentation was nice and the seafood was better than expected.  Dessert was the most impressive.  I had the Lychee Panna Cotta, he had a Chai Chocolate Mousse.  Both were delicious.  They only had Steamwhistle on tap and the tap wasn't working until later in the meal, so we both started with Tigers.    Overall, I enjoyed Bankok garden, the atmosphere and the service.  I'm curious about the lunch buffet.  But, I'm not sure that I will return for dinner because I have had more interesting Thai food for this price."}
{"text":"Good ambiance BUT - unhappy waiters - way over-priced  But if you fancy this, it's still good food."}
{"text":"After eating many a meal in Thailand, this place was a huge dud. So not authentic.  I spend 17$ for a lunch buffet when I had food from carts on the streets of bangkok that tasted much, much better."}
{"text":"We had complimentary 4 course dinner vouchers to Bangkok Garden from our Couple Spa package that we had bought for Elmwood Spa. We were greeted right away and taken to our seats. We were seated by the hostess and menu cards for the 4 course dinner were left at the table (we didnt notice as we were gwtting settles down) The waiter came over and poured us water and greeted us with a Hello. No name, no check if we would like anything else to drink(the 4 course dinner does not come with drinks and is additional cost) we were left alone and not shown our options on the menu. We now noticed that the menu cards were on the tBle and went ahead and made pur selections. Our waiter was back in a few minutes to take our order. Appertizers were out in about 10 minites that was the longest wait all the other courses were out aa soon as we were done with our dish. The quick service was good and we never felt rushed between our courses. The food was good, but I would pick SukoThai anyday. We were then handed the bill which had two huge red stamps on them saying Gratuite not included on top of the bill and at the bottom of the bill and wwre both circled vigirously. I get that they might have had no tippers preciously but this just seemed a little over! Anyhoo over all the service was a 3/5 food was 3.5/5 and ambiance was 3/5. We might visit back just for a change or if we are at Elmwood spa."}
{"text":"My parents and I went to Bangkok Garden for Winterlicious 2017 on Super Bowl Sunday. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look that big, however, the second you go up the stairs you can really appreciate how big the restaurant really is considering the location.  The décor of the restaurant was very modern and looks quite nice, made for quite the atmosphere to be eating in. I enjoyed it quite a bit if I do say so myself.  Food  I ordered the following items from the Winterlicious 2017 menu: * Chicken Spring Rolls * Spicy Shrimp Pad Thai * Casava Cake  I thought the Chicken Spring Rolls were the best part of the meal. They were nice and crispy, but, they were not overly greasy or oily and they were stuffed perfectly.   The Spicy Shrimp Pad Thai was quite a disappointment. According to their menu, this is the one dish they are known for. Honestly, to begin with, it wasn't really spicy at all. There was no heat or spiciness so to speak. The portion size was pretty good and there was certainly enough shrimp that's for sure. I just honestly thought there was nothing famous about it in my opinion. I wouldn't be able to distinguish it between other places that served Pad Thai.  I'm not a fan of coconut, but, it wasn't too overpowering and overwhelming. The cake was really nice, fluffy, and moist and the sauce that was accompanying it was great too.   Drinks Average beer selection, I had the Great Lakes Brewery Winter Ale and it was great.  Service The service, in my opinion, left a lot to be desired. The restaurant was fairly busy but not overtly busy.  When we put our drink and food orders all at once, it took about 10 to 15 minutes for us to get our drinks. The appetizer came out before our drinks. But, I understand, sometimes these things can happen.  However, what really disappointed me was that before any of us had even finished our appetizers our main course/dish was brought to our table! I was not a big fan of this at all; we hadn't even remotely been close to finishing our appetizers. I'm not really sure why this occurred, but, I felt like we were being rushed a little bit.   After we got our dessert and wanted to pay our bill we had to wait another 15 minutes or so to flag our waitress down.  Overall, I felt the service really needed to improve."}
{"text":"Delicious, nice vibe, and very reasonably priced Thai food!"}
{"text":"I think I could eat Pad Thai for breakfast lunch and dinner. Usually there is little thought process needed when invited to a Thai restaurant, yes I'll go, yes I'll check the menu and invariably yes I'll have the pad Thai. Bangkok Garden however was just the restaurant to break my routine.   Upon entering you can't help but admire the atmosphere, especially the wood and terraced seating. The seating being so distinct sitting in one area may be a totally unique experience from a different area.   We started with Daiquiris, Mango and Raspberry. Even on this cold night they tasted delicious. 3 hot Spring Rolls were split and also were excellent.   For the main course I had the Emerald Curry of Chicken. The menu assigns chillies according to a spiciness scale with my choice garnering the top 4 chillies. I wasn't disappointed. The meal came out in a beautiful blue and white casserole, almost like a stew with chicken. Along side the waitress placed an equally lovely bowl with white rice. Perfectly sticky to place the Green curry, coconut cream with basil, lime, chilies and garlic on top of.   Bangkok garden offers delicious food in an above average setting, perfect for a lovely evening with your significant other or a small group of friends. It's not boisterous inside, better for a romantic evening than a first date in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good service. Food was OK but too few choices in terms of buffet. Price relatively high comparing to the food."}
{"text":"Overall the experience is okay.   Came here as part of a Elmwood Spa package. The food is good (better then average, not great). Initial service was slow and the prices are high; $110 for a four course dinner for two (sans wine).   My advice, if your here for the spa, sure this is a easy addition; but you can do better.   I also found the decor while nice, lacked intimacy.  I don't imagine I will come back."}
{"text":"Thai-rrific!   All good things grow in Bangkok Garden.  The chicken and fish dishes were absolutely delicious.    Finally, I found a place that has great tasting Thai food but serves ample portions with just the right amount of spice as well.  The fried banana dessert rocked the temple.   The decor sets the mood.  From serene waterfalls to Thai metal sculptures doing crazy dances, your appetite will rise as you near your table.   Bangkok Garden has been around for over 30 years.  With top-notch entrees and service they will be here for the next 30.  Toronto has some of the best cuisine around.  Visiting Thai foodies will have a culinary adventure in this city."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for Summerlicious. The dinner menu was priced at $25 and it sounded reasonable.   I got the Thai Hot Wings for the appetizer. It was delicious, although you can't really go wrong with hot wings. For the main, I couldn't decide between the green curry pad thai or the beef red curry and asked the waiter to make a suggestion and he wasn't helpful in that regard. I asked him which was the spicier dish and he said the red curry so I picked it. The beef red curry was a bit disappointing. First, it wasn't that spicy and second, it was just too oily (my stomach protested when I got home). They did give quite a lot of beef though. For dessert, I got the banana fritters with ice-cream. It tasted good but the fritter was a bit too breaded for my liking.   Service - mediocre. They were generally not very attentive - took a while before I could get the attention of a waiter. They also didn't refill our glasses that regularly.   Cleanliness - my spoon was dirty. It had a tiny bit of encrusted food on it and I had to get it changed. Other than that, everything else was fine.   OVERALL: I might give it another go. I saw that they had a lunch buffet and I'll give it a go before I decide on whether I'll be a regular customer of theirs."}
{"text":"I've been sitting on the reservation for a while and finally the night was here.  Upon entry, I loved it immediately!  The decor was inviting, and relaxing as well as romantic.  Cultural art works, metallic art, trickling waterfalls, are but the simple hello's the restaurant says to you upon entry.  The food came out hot and delicious and very good portions. I absolutely love this place and will be back to eat through the menu."}
{"text":"Love love love the food here! Buffet is great, lots of choice and $15.95. Dinner is amazing too! Grilled beef is my fav!"}
{"text":"Really delicious, have been coming here for years and often do takeout. Not sure why the bad reviews, maybe don't come just for summerlicious but try to sample their full menu properly.  The green and golden curries are richly flavourful and favourites on the menu. The atmosphere is very nice with Thai decor aplenty to set the mood.  Highly recommend unless you are cranky, please don't show up and write a nasty review."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious dinner and I really enjoyed the experience. For my main course, I had the veggie Pad Thai glass noodles with green curry. I was skeptical of the glass noodles, but I was pleasantly surprised. The dish was quite flavourful and the portions were huge. Great value, lovely ambiance, and friendly service overall."}
{"text":"They have a fairly affordable lunch buffet, but the quality of food isn't the best.   Highlights/lowlights: Red vegetable curry - very very watery. It just tastes spicy but doesn't have flavour. It lacks the creaminess and coconut aroma of thai curry. Pad thai - I can't figure it what it is, but it's missing something. A bit more tamarind maybe? It just didn't taste quite right. Vegetable bites - probably my favourite dish. It kind of reminds me of a vegetable pakora. And lets face it, you can't really screw up something that's deep fried I guess... Mango salad - decent taste and a lot of mango Banana fritters - maybe it's because they were out at the buffet bar, but the \"crispy\" outside of the banana fritter was kind of mushy and not fresh.  They also have a noodle soup bar, which I was too full to try. I also wish they had mango sticky rice on the menu. Their dessert selections were not great.  Overall, I wouldn't come here again. There really was nothing that stood out at their buffet, so I'm skeptical that any dish made to order will be better. There are much better Thai restaurants in Toronto now which are more worth the money and calories."}
{"text":"You almost killed me with ur hot peppers when I didn't even want it spicy. You also cheapin out on filling your patrons glasses with your sewer water."}
{"text":"Once again a fabulous Emerald Curry at Bangkok Garden. A beautiful setting and delicious food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Takes WAY too long for any service. 20 minutes for a drink and over 45 minutes for a simple order. Also overpriced for the amount and quality of the food."}
{"text":"I went here last summer for summerlicious at lunch. The atmosphere was really nice, a beautiful restaurant. The service was prompt as well.   I forget what I ordered for starters, but I ordered the Pad Thai for my entree. It was really good, but not something I would run back there to get. The dessert was like a mango type pudding, not bad, but not great either.   This place was nice, the food was nice, but for the price... I would go elsewhere. It's too expensive for thai food."}
{"text":"As far as Thai food in Totonyo hoes, there are plenty of newer options that offer much better, and much more authentic Thai meals. My most recent visit was disappointing. The green curry and the starter lemongrass soup that I ordered were essentially the same dish. Had I known that, I would have gotten something else for one of my courses. My waiter could have spoken up. The buffet looked ok but I was having a lunch meeting so we opted to go with the menu, which may have been the wrong choice. I won't be rushing back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a big group of people and I must say I was very pleased!  The execution was on point, the quality of food was very good and the ambiance was classy and friendly. In my opinion, the curries really stood out for their rich and spicy flavour and well balanced ingredients. This place is definitely worth a try if you like spicy and flavourful curries."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Thai food in a lovely, upscale atmosphere with definite upscale pricing. This is twice as much as you'll pay at most Thai places in Toronto. Also, the portions are a bit on the smaller end. The odd thing I noticed that if you order a meat dish (as opposed to a noodle or curry dish), it's just meat. And you get rice on the side. There are no veggies mixed in with the grilled meat. If you wanted to add a \"side\" of veggies, that's about the cost of a main at most Thai places in Toronto. So you're paying about double for the mains here, and if you want veggies, you'd pay about thrice as much.   I wouldn't make a habit of coming here often. The prices are definitely for tourists."}
{"text":"I was not sure by the 3 star rating, but I am glad I tried this place.   The food was amazing. I started with the Tom Kha Gai soup and it was delicious. Very velvety in texture and with a great balance of flavours, and it is well served. The emerald curry was also astounding in the levels of flavours, the zing of the curry with the coconut milk and vegetables melts with the rice and gives the chicken a great push. I finished it even with the large portion I was served.  The restaurant is cute, clean and thematic, almost too much with the water and multi levels but it does create an atmosphere.   I don't know why it sports 3 stars, for me it's unwarranted. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I wish I could say the same about the service. Our waiter didn't offer to refill our water during the entire meal. Nor did he even bother to place our bill in a bill folder like the other tables he was serving. He clearly played favorites with certain tables but I will withhold from speculating on the reasons why."}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant with some good food and modern dimly lit decor. It's a short walk from Eaton Centre so it's a good option for dinner after shopping.   This review is for the Winterlicious menu. We had the Thai calamari and coconut mussel soup for appetizers. The portions are quite small and the calamari was crispy if a bit on the greasy side. It was good but the coconut soup was better. The soup was creamy with a hint of sourness. It was satisfying.  The sriracha bbq pork was disappointing. It barely tasted of either sriracha or barbeque. It was almost tasteless. The crispy fish with red curry was so good, however. I'm not usually one for spicy dishes but this was so good that I had to keep eating it, though my mouth was slightly burning. I'd go back to eat just that.   The warm white chocolate rice pudding barely tasted of white chocolate. It's basically just rice pudding, and it was okay. The cassava cake was also forgettable. It came in three tiny cubes and it was drier than it should be. My mother makes this cake and it was far from my standards. Ah well, I still really enjoyed the fish."}
{"text":"Interior was nice but the buffet was a bit of a disappointment. Not enough variety. The curries seemed a bit watered down and wasn't that good to begin with. Everything else was just ok.  The best thing I had there was probably the fried chicken wings and they tasted like the typical wings you get from a Chinese food stall. The soup and noodle stand was not bad but that was basically it. At buffets I normally am excited after the first round to try something else. Here, I was pretty much done after my first pass."}
{"text":"For lunch time speed and fulfilling all your Thai dreams, go up the stairs to the west side of the Elmwood Spa. This place used to be a little hole in the wall basement, but it's moved up many notches since then.  There are fairly standard items like spring rolls and mango salad. The hot dishes run the gamut from Tofu and vegetables in a red or green curry to the pad thai pot and the beef, chicken and seafood dishes.  There is always a lonely lady to the right waiting to serve you freshly prepared soup. When I was there, she only had thai chicken noodle soup, and since I don't eat Chicken, I was having none of that.   Safe a spot of room for dessert- there are usually an interesting collection of battered and fried fruits- banana or sweet potatoes?  This is not the most authentic, so I don't recommend it highly for dinner. But, for a quick, Bay street lunch, head on up!"}
{"text":"Great Thai place with amazing atmosphere! Probably the best for its genre, considering most Thai vendors have lackluster atmosphere and interior. However, the food prices reflect the added glamor. Prices are still affordable and the food is good. Food options are your typically and flavor is good, but nothing tell your granny about. This restaurant is best for a date or more classy dinner.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a place where we keep coming back for Thai food. Their Pad Thai has got to be the best I tried in Toronto - and they make it with Tamarind sauce instead of ketchup, as many places do.  The best deal is to visit this place during lunch time. It's inexpensive, and the food selection is great. However, we've been there several times for dinner and were never disappointed. Both the food and the service are usually very good. The prices are a bit more expensive than other places (not by much though, main courses are around $16-21), but the food is consistently delicious and they could make it any way you want (add/remove ingredients, add/reduce spice, etc.)  If you love Thai food, try this restaurant out."}
{"text":"So slow, the calamari is not crispy, other courses are just as average level as the food court."}
{"text":"We ordered take out after seeing a show downtown.  I had trouble viewing their menu on my iPhone, I could r click in to certain parts of the menu like noodles.  I called and ordered blindly what I know but didn't know the prices so this was a bit of a loss of a star for me.  I ended up with a pad Thai, shrimp fried rice and a red curry.  The shrimps they use in their pad Thai and fried rice was quite large and a pleasant surprise as usually places skimp in super small shrimp.  The curry had a nice heat and flavor.  Overall we were happy with our takeout.  Just wish the website functioned better for me to see more things I could have ordered!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Came here not so long ago for the Winterlicious prix fixe dinner menu. I had the curry Pad Thai for the main. Yum.   The decor/atmosphere was acceptable, but nothing to rave about. We sat up front to the right of the hostess' area. A few people kept passing back and forth through the neighbouring entrance as we ate.  However, the food was tasty and the service was prompt and attentive. No complaints here.  Would definitely recommend this place, and will probably stop in again when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Thai food, I would not recommend. We ordered the following dishes: Mango salad: mango was not marinated well Sarah skewers: the meat wasn't merinated either Calamari: overlooked and dry. Sauce is alright Pad Thai: this is the only dish it saved it from having only 1 star."}
{"text":"Do not judge the place by its entrance. U wont guess whats inside. Its the most fancy looking Thai restaurants I have been to. And I have been to many. Just by looking at the ambience you get a feeling you have come to a different country altogether. and the food helps you maintain the feeling. very tasty food. the simplest dish as chicken fried rice was delicious than any other fried rice you have ever had. the shrimp chips were the best. The restaurant is not as expensive as it may look like. definitely a place to go agian."}
{"text":"I've travelled to about 40 countries, including Thailand many times.  AT BEST this was poor quality western Chinese food.  VERY disappointed if they claim this is Thai style.  So many other places for good Thai in Toronto. Way over priced for what you get.    Save your money and disappointment and go elsewhere.  And they charge your tip on top of the tax too.  Terrible.   I had been here many times in the past, service atmosphere usually good, food was average.    After many years absent, decided to bring guests and give it another try.  The front is renovated very modern, which I think ruins the old Thai décor.  The service was good although we asked her to suggest a combo for 4 and the only idea was to double a combo for 2, hardly creative."}
{"text":"Although the food was good, service is terrible, awful. If they train their staff to be friendly I would consider going back."}
{"text":"It's okay... I suppose  I love Thai food!... It is my absolute favourite!  However, this was a disappointment and way over priced.    There are much better Thai restaurants out there...  There are only two good things that stand out about this place;  the atmosphere and the grilled garlic beef.   That's it.     The service is okay, the the setup of the place is... okay.  The price... was not that okay... very pricey for very average Thai food.    Two recommendations; 1. Go to any other Thai restaurant, this one is not worth it. 2. If you are going to go... try to get a seat upstairs.  If this review is not enough... put it this way... there is obviously a reason why there are so few 5 star comments from other yelp users..  To sum it up...  Its okay... I suppose"}
{"text":"It was okay.  But just okay.  I just went there for Winterlicious.  I ordered spring rolls (appetizer), anytime noodles - vegetarian (entree), and Thai custard with coconut rice (dessert).  The appetizer and entree were delicious but the dessert was gross.  My boyfriend ordered the same appetizer and entree as I did but he had the Thai rice pudding with black and white beans for dessert.  It was okay.  So yeah, not a fan of the dessert, but the rest was really good.  That being said, I can find pretty good Thai food at other places.  The service?  Slow.  The waitress was so awkward and was never around.  I get that they can be busy but, by the end of it, there were about three other people in our area and two waters.  Our waitress just disappeared when we were waiting to have the rest of our entree packed up (to take home, there was quite a bit!).  I just wasn't impressed by the staff.  But the food took longer than usual to make (longer than I've seen at other restaurants at least).  The inside of the restaurant was pretty.  But it was soooo crowded.  When the waitress was at the table next to us, her back was basically ON our table!  It was not nice.  I felt like they just put our table in the aisle or something.  It was so crowded and not nice at all.  I just felt like I was in the way.  The place wasn't packed or anything at the time I went, so I don't see why they had to have tables there.  It was very awkward.  It was also kind of loud in there, I had troubles hearing my boyfriend talk from across the table.  Although perhaps we were talking quieter than normal, since we were basically right next to the table beside us.  We could hear all of their conversations, at least.  All in all, it was okay.  I wouldn't go back.  I don't go out to eat much, so I'd rather take a chance with a \"new\" restaurant or go to one that I really enjoyed rather than go back to a moderate restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a pretty \"safe\" Thai spot if you're around the Dundas Square area. Lots of tourists and business folks staying at the Delta next door.   The bar area upstairs seems to be newly renovated, but the dining room is decorated in an 80s-Asian-exotic style reflective of the fact that Thai food was new to Toronto when this place opened. Its a bit too dim inside, but overall the atmosphere was pleasant.  They only have a few beers on tap, but there were some local choices like Hog Town and Steam Whistle.  I had the thai spicy curry, and it was decent but not at all spicy, as I've come to expect at the more \"westernized\" thai restaurants. Nothing to write home about.  I'll give this three stars as the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very good food...very nice decor...no competition as to the nicest decor in Toronto for a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I was here as part of the Elm Wood Spa exotic escape package for two. The restaurant is beautiful with its two tiered main dining area but I must say that the front of the restaurant is odd in how the entrance from the spa is on one side, then the bar and then the stairs coming up from the main entrance. I must digress. The appetizers were good we ordered skewers (chicken, beef, and pork) and shrimp spring rolls. The next dishes were a Tom Yum soup and papaya salad. Both were good but  the salad being the much better choice.   The caveat here is that I'm part Vietnamese and I BLEED fish sauce metaphorically of course. You could see my delight as I could smell it from the second floor as someone below me was having it. When it hit the table and I smelled it I was smiling and then I ate it. It was delicious with a real funk of flavour. In that moment this was the 2nd to 3rd best Tom Yum soup I had ever had. Then I continued to eat and it was among the top 10 worst soups I've ever had. The problem here is that the harsh flavour of fish sauce builds to just salt, acid, and spice lingering in the back of your throat the more you eat it, and you have no way to balance it unless you have a lovely partner who ordered the papaya salad and is willing to share. It made it hard to go back to the soup. Also as much as I bleed fish sauce it was like receiving a bad transfusion of blood, my body started to realize that this did not belong in my body.   The dinner continued to go down hill from there with the mains being downright inedible to me. I got the trout steam in a banana leaf with sliced pepper and a Chili sauce. The fish was over cooked, fishy tasting and smelling, as well as bland without the sauce, and the pepper were almost raw (which I don't mind) but added nothing to the dish or fish. My partner got the green curry. It as better but way too spicy to eat for us. This might have been one of those things where we're just not used to the authentic heat or flavour of this regions food, but I'll wait for confirmation from a Thai person before I completely make that call.   The dessert was a mango panna cotta. Not a panna cotta more just a pudding but it was good enough that we ignored it.   The service here was great and friendly. I've read the other reviews of this restaurant and though they did not get our order wrong the service did take a longish time between courses. As a server myself I hate the narrow staircase I see them walking food up. And I saw at least one server deliver food to either an empty table or a table that walked out, and another server wander around with a drink order that didn't belong to 3 whole tables that he checked with. He was left walking back in defeat.   Not a fan and if not for the spa package would never have chosen to come here. Two stars purely because our server was really nice."}
{"text":"I came here to try out the Summerlicious 2013 dinner menu. I made a quick reservation on Opentable the day before and it was really that simple.  Bangkok Garden is around Ryerson U and is surrounded by other great looking restaurants that I would love to try. When my friend and I got there, the decor inside was nice but seemed a little dark, so I ended up sitting outside on to the patio by some beautiful flowers. The server was really helpful and explained the menu and answered some of the questions I had. So to start off, I decided to try their Watermelon Cooler. It was on my table within 5 minutes and when I took a sip of it.. it was soo refreshingly good! The server was ready to take our order so we ended up ordering everything all at once. For our appetizers, we ordered the Spring rolls which were fresh and crispy and my friend ordered the Shrimp/chicken skewers, the skewer was edible because it was made out of sugar cane, which was really neat. For our mains, I got the Red thai beef curry and my friend got the Green curry pad thai. I loved my Red curry since it was spicy and my beef wasn't chewy at all. I tried some of my friends pad thai and thought it was mediocre, seemed a little too sweet. Finally for dessert, I got the Green tea ice cream with sticky rice and I felt like it was tasteless, so I didn't end up finishing it. My friend on the other hand, got the Mango pudding which was just delicious and we ended up sharing that together. The food came out perfectly timed giving us about 5-10 minutes between each course and our table was cleared every time. Not to mention, the food presentation was great, I loved those little details. Great restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"Went here to eat last night after having a couple's package at Elmwood next store.  Decor upon entrance was lovely and dining room although spacious was starting to look a little dated.  Lovely water feature with fish makes it nice and relaxing as well as exotic.  With our set menu we got to choose: 1 appetizer, 1 soup/salad, 1 entree and 1 dessert.  For the appetizer we got:  Chicken spring rolls/uncooked - these were good and the sauce was the typical fish sauce with chili.  Thai Calamari - chewy rubber bands is what I would use to describe them.  The dipping sauce helped.  There was nothing Thai about this dish except the sauce.  For the soup/salad portion we got:  Chicken coconut soup - flavorful and no complaints.  Tom Young Goong (Tiger Shrimp Lemon Soup) - it was all savory and no lemon could be detected.  A disappointment and quite honestly a big FAIL.  For the entrees:  Sea Bass baked in banana leaf - it was rather yummy.  Siamese Beef - terrible.  Although the meat was well seasoned, the cut of beef completely ruined it.  It was chewy and had tendons in some portions where I asked for a knife (even though it was pre cut into strips).  The waiter returned with a bread knife to my chagrin.  We received a side of mixed vegetables as well which was the standard Asian fare of water chestnuts, bok choi, broccoli, mini corn, cabbage and carrots.  For dessert:  Mango pannacotta - my husband asked for the creme brulee of the day and he got the mango pannacotta.  Not sure what to think of that.  But he ate it anyways since we didn't want to wait for service again.  Just ok.  Fried banana - fried banana with mango ice cream.  Was just ok.  The banana was over cooked with the batter which made the edges of it very hard and chewy.  Overall the food was MEH.  I've had better to be honest and would expect a Thai restaurant to have flavors bursting out at the seams.  It didn't help that the service from the wait staff was lack luster.  At one point another waiter came to clear our table because he saw us staring into the ceiling as we waited for our next course.  He had no idea we were on a set course and asked if we wanted to order something else to eat.  If you're looking for a real kick ass Thai experience then I would skip this place.  It probably use to be really good but it's food says otherwise and can be summed up as being bland.  For our experience, it was valued at $97 plus a $17 tip we left."}
{"text":"this is the best thai restaurant i have ever been too.  i really mean it.  first the place is so beautiful, done up so well, various thai head dresses and imperial looking robes decorate the hall.  look at the various wood carvings and buddhist worship implements.  its all so beautiful.  then you must see this and i have never seen this anywhere else - they have the most amazing vegetable and fruit carved into pieces of art.  i just can't describe it in words.  it is like going to the bodies exhibit and you say to yourself how the hell did they do that, that must have taken so much patience.  just go and see for yourself.  the food is amazing.  this is high end flavor at a cheapass' budget.  even the buffet is amazing.  i can only think of two restaurants where i've had amazing lunch buffet food that is rangmahal in hicksville, ny (too bad they don't have buffet anymore) and bangkok garden.  TOO BAD this place is not in NY."}
{"text":"Their Bangkok rolls are probably the best I've ever had.  Very fresh, flavorful with varied textures. These contain chicken; I'm usually more fond of vegetable rolls. But these were amazing. My entree - chicken with cashew nuts was flavorful and spicy. I would order that again. But the rolls were stellar. I only wish that I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with a huge group and we opted for the buffet option.  For $16.99/person, the offerings were the slimmest I've ever seen for a buffer restaurant. There were maybe 20 hot items, a soup bar and a very mini dessert table. Everything was very average, just okay, nothing memorable. Decor gave a nice authentic ambiance though. Would not dine here again as can easily get better value anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet on the weekdays is fantastic. Great value for money specially the spread they offer from soups to appetizers to mains and desserts.  You must try the soup bar and have the \"soup lady\" prepare the soup with your choice of noodles and proteins with all the ingredients laid out. I add a bit of the chilli vinegar and sugar at the end (a bit extra) cause I like the spicy as soon as I sip and lingering sweetness towards the end!  Great ambiance, great food and great service! Can't go wrong!  Will most definitely recommend this restaurant for a weekday lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered from the restaurant via Foodora tonight.  While the meal was good, the menu does not indicate that orders include rice, so I ordered some.  I am not a big fan of plain, white rice.  Since many people are low carb these days, it would be nice if they offered an option to include or not include rice, as well as the option to change the type of rice they would like to include in a meal (the restaurant has both white and brown as well as coconut versions of each).  I would have given them four stars, but the rice thing was a mistake."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner and loved it! Great service, our waiter was very attentive and polite  It happened to be the summerlicious menu so the meal was pretty standard thai food - not that thats a bad thing! We did come for thai food! I was impressed by the drink menu, large selection with great prices Overall i'll go back! Only con would be that it was a tad too spicy for me, but i'm a complete wimp when it comes to spice!"}
{"text":"Came here again with my girlfriend to try their normal menu. Oh my. I think I'm in love (sorry babe). She opted for the tilapia (part of their special Coconut menu), while I ordered the grilled Cornish hen and lemongrass.  They're not kidding when they say the Cornish hen is grilled to perfection.  It was succulent and perfectly seasoned, and the spicy orange dipping sauce it came with complemented the dish very well.  The tilapia was amazing too; I don't know what they put in the sauce, but it was addictive.  We ended off our night with dessert: the Panko fried banana with coconut ice cream for her (again, off the special Coconut menu) and the mango panna cotta for me.  I'm not really a fan of deep fried banana, but I quite enjoyed my choice.  Though it can be a little too sweet for those who don't have a sweet tooth like me.    Overall, I was thoroughly pleased with the experience.  The food can be pretty expensive (I paid $60 for this meal), so I definitely wouldn't be coming here regularly, but if you're cognizant of the prices beforehand, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet at $15.99 is not a bad deal, considering it's all you can eat. Maybe it was the holiday season, but it was not the most comfortable place to eat, however.   I've been coming here since I was young and the place has changed quite a bit. It used to be all adorned with photos from their opening 30 years ago which had a live elephant parading around Elm Street, and I loved looking at the Thai shrine (which is still there). The place to me at the time was HUGE, double floors, and the goldfish pond was awesome - but it felt to small to me today. Maybe it was all the big coats, and tons of people, but it was crowded. Now it's all white, sleek and modern, but they left the main dining area the same as it used to me.  We walked in, and you enter the bar area, which they are trying to promote as a lounge for people to come sit for Happy Hour and have appetizers. This is also where they put the buffet. I don't know if this is the best space for it. The line up went down the entryway to the stairs when you come in. It's really narrow and people moved really slowly. The crowd here seemed like they all were having thai food for the first time.   There was mango salad (meh), fresh rolls (which fell apart), some curries, eggplant (didn't taste like anything), pad thai, rice. The best part was make your own soup noodles with all different types of dressings, two types of noodles and fillings. Not sure if this is thai or just asian influenced. It was good, be careful of the chili's they were hot! I found that the food wasn't as flavourful, and very mild.   Service was okay, but we sat really unforgettably on the upper floor at a small tiny table.   I cringe when I think about going to the bathroom. It's all the way downstairs, in the same location as it used to be back in the day - but now it's 'owned' by Elmwood Spa. Don't be surprised as you walk in and see someone in a robe walking out. It's a little strange, especially for spa guests. The worst part is I passed by some sort of work / storage room, that was some fumes which I had to hold my breath for. It couldn't have been healthy.   Overall, I will indulge with my dad to come here because he likes it and reminds of days gone past, but really - skip it and head down the street and over to Sabai Sabai, for a thai experience and diversity that is a lot more exceptional (and cheaper)."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bangkok Garden at their lunch buffet and it was good, with a lot of diverse items to choose from such as spring rolls, green and red curries, basil chicken, rice, noodles, and more. I came here for dinner and my experience was just satisfactory.   The friendly hostess greeted me and I was seated quickly. I had the Thai spicy curry (gang pa) with chicken and requested red chilies, as I like my food spicy. While the dish was flavourful, it was lacking spice and it did not come with red chilies, as I had requested. I had also requested traditional Thai prik nam pla sauce, and was told they did not have it. I'm surprised that Bangkok Garden, which bills itself as an authentic Thai restaurant, would not have such a sauce. I also had the frozen blended passionfruit and mango drink, which was essentially dessert in glass and very refreshing.   Service could have been friendlier. The ambiance is elegant and sophisticated, but that alone would not warrant a visit from me in the near future."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my hotel concierge for good Thai food...to go.   The outside is underwhelming and I would have probably walked right past this place and not given it a second glance. Since I was looking for it... not an issue. The inside was fine, although I went straight to the bar to place my order.   I went with Pad Thai..my staple to judge the place and also got some coconut rice square things for dessert which are only on the lunch menu. Yes....the price was/is high compared to other Thai places in the area, however I found the food to be above average. I love that it came with shrimp and chicken and I was able to add tofu -  a must for me. The sauce was good...not overly sweet and a portion large enough for 2 meals. Also it blew Spring Rolls and Salad King's Pad Thai away... I would pay extra for my food not being drenched in oil, wouldn't you?  The dessert was also good...but then again if it has coconut, can you really go wrong!?  The hostess was VERY friendly and chatty...20 minutes worth of chatter, while I tried to slip of my bar stool and out to door to indulge in my meal.  Honestly though...I prefer that over getting an unfriendly glance as I walk out the door. I would come back here...at least for the Pad Thai and I did hear that the lunch buffet was good, if you are a buffet lover and in the area."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch Buffet. They have one section for cold dishes: glass noodle salad, mango Jicama salad, fresh roll, chicken wings, Thai spring rolls. For the hot dish, they serve spicy fish option,  Thai, and different types of curry such as with chicken.  My favourite is the soup noodle station, you can select your own topping such as fish balls and other herbs, garlic, vinegar and the noodle between the rice noodle and egg noodle. The rice noodle taste better but sometimes I just ask for the soup with the fish balls so I can save room to eat other things."}
{"text":"Not exactly what one's palate would be treated to while in Thailand. So, this would be my first miss. Secondly, their wait staff seems to be extremely busy and needs a bit of a constant reminder of what I want. A touch too tedious to dine here and a bit off the taste mark."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic thai food. Great service and reasonable pricing. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"We were referred to this Thai restaurant by the concierge at our hotel, because we had just gotten into town and wanted to grab some lunch while waiting to check in. I'm so glad we took his advice, because this restaurant has an excellent lunch buffet with lots of Vegetarian selections on it. The staff was really great and the service was really good too. We enjoyed the lunch buffet so much, that we decided to go back again. If we go back to Toronto again, we will be back."}
{"text":"We've only done take out here but like most of the other Elm Street restaurants, this place is fantastic. They lose a star for being pricey and not answering their phone regularly.  Their spring rolls are really good as is there ginger fish."}
{"text":"So I was having a craving for Thai food, but not food court Thai...something more authentic. Went to my trusty friend, Google and up popped Bangkok Garden.   It was so close to my workplace...total bonus! Less than 2 mins to get there.  Enter....what a beautiful place! And the hostess, so friendly! She takes me to my seat, and asks if I will be enjoying the buffet or menu today. Buffet????? Bonus!!!!! $15.99/pp....not bad!!! All the food was awesome. I had vegetable pad thai, basil fish with steamed rice, fresh rolls, veggie spring rolls, mango salad, glass noodles, tom yum soup, chicken wings, etc. So good!!! I'm so full up! Washed it all down with a big glass of mango juice.  My 2 waiters were awesome...super friendly and very knowledgeable. I had to ask about some of the dishes due to a food allergy.  Will definitely go there again!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for their luncheon buffet and there was good variety and the dishes very tasty.   I was dissapointed that they had run out of curried chicken so soon (it was 1 hour before they stopped serving)  and I asked twice about it and was told they were bringing some more.   They eventually (20 minutes later) brought out maybe 2 cups worth of food, but by then I'd already finished my meal.   Although they have plenty of staff, they are not too attentive to the buffet itself once they put it out.   So I was disappointed because I don't eat fish nor pork,  of which there was plenty of in the buffet."}
{"text":"My boss took me out for lunch at one of her favourite Thai restaurants for my last day of work! We both love Thai food, and since it was a bit of a special occasion, we decided to do the buffet style lunch. I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews for this place, because I absolutely LOVED it!  The service and atmosphere was great. Bangkok Garden definitely works for all sorts of events - casual meals, fancy meals, or business formal meals. I think it gives off many different vibes that could work for any occasion. I did however see A LOT of people in suits so I'd assume they cater more towards the business people in the area.   As for the food, I really liked how there were so many different options to choose from. I tried the soup, the appetizers (spring rolls, mango salad, regular salad, fried vegetables, etc.), and of course all of the noodles and curries. I thought everything tasted excellent and was full of flavour, but my specific favourites were the pad thai and the yellow curry. Yum!   Needless to say, I'd visit again. I personally prefer restaurants like Pai or Khao San Road in Toronto for a more authentic taste of Thai food, but I would still recommend coming to Bangkok Garden for the buffet lunch to try all of the different dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the heart of the city, just a block north of the Toronto Eaton Center. It's embedded in the Delta Chelsea hotel, smack dab in the middle of Elm Street.  Enticed by their winterlicious menu, I made reservations for dinner here a week ago. I started off with the \"trio rolls\" which consisted of 1 fresh spring roll (just veggies, cold roll), 1 prawn roll (fried), and 1 Thai spring roll (also fried and appears to have meat in it.) All 3 spring rolls were large in size which was surprising since I've noticed restaurants usually scale back on their meal portions during winterlicious. I enjoyed the fried spring rolls immensely (specifically the prawn roll) however I was not a fan of the cold roll as it was very dry in texture and not very flavorful in taste.  For my main course I ordered the \"Any Time Noodle Seafood (Phad Si Ew Talay)\". It's components were an array of seafood favourites such as shrimp, mussels and squid mixed with broad noodles and vegetables. The portion of the meal was gigantic and I could not finish the entire meal in one sitting. I think the dish should have been saltier but I usually like lots of salt on my meals. Overall, it was an OK main.  The dessert I ordered was Thai Tea Creme Caramel. This creamy flan concotion had overtures of caramel and was not overly sweet. It was a nice and light finish to a pretty heavy meal.  The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was a little bit classier than your average sit down restaurant. The place was also dimly lit and I did not really see any traces of a garden...but that could just be because it was rather dark in there and I may have missed any \"garden like\" decor. The staff were very friendly. They have a coat check which is convenient for the winter weather. Our waitress was also very friendly and the service was fast - the food came out quickly and was freshly made.  Tip:  I would book a reservation ahead of time. I had dinner almost immediately after work and I made reservations at exactly 5PM so we were able to get a table. When we left I overheard a couple looking for a table to eat but was told that the only available tables were at 830PM."}
{"text":"Came here on a frigid winter day with a large group of over 20 ppl for a birthday lunch celebration. We arrived for our reservation just before noon and occupied three large tables. For round 1, I had the mango salad (tasty!), crispy spring roll (average), fried chicken wings (good), fresh spring roll (average), pineapple tofu stir fry (average), pad Thai (under average!), spicy beef (tasty), chicken curry (tasty), and beef curry (tasty).   Second round I had a bowl of noodles made to order-- you could pick your meat (cooked shredded chicken pieces, beef balls, fish balls, fish cake, and shrimp balls. You could get your soup flavoured with scallions, picked vegetables, red birds eye chilli in vinegar, dried chillies flakes, fish sauce, sugar, crushed peanuts, cilantro... I asked for beef balls, fish cake and requested she make it 'extra spicy' and it was! A pretty good bowl of soup to warm me up.   For dessert, there were banana fritters and yam fries with honey, fruit (pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, watermelon), double layered coconut jello, green jello with coconut flakes and peeled rambutan stuffed with pineapple. Dessert was a nice ending to the meal.  For $16, it was just ok. For that price, I would rather have a really good bowl of curry with authentic Thai flavour rather than this watered down (westernized) Thai food. Even so, this place seemed popular. You could see the restaurant filling up and thankfully the food got refreshed quite promptly. Not recommended for anyone with peanut allergies though since peanuts are everyone!   The thing that put a significant damper on the whole outing was the process of paying the bill. The waiter that we were working with was clearly not very happy about accommodating a large group and limited our entire group to 3 credit card payments.   More than 3 people did not have cash and he was visibly exasperated and not very service oriented. When the first few ppl tried to pay with credit, the machine stopped working and he had to take out the old school credit card imprinting machine. Such a hassle and not fun overall. Sad how one person ruined our celebration.   I seriously don't understand how a business can allow for this kind of poor service when we are clearly bringing significant revenue through their doors. Will not be returning if I can help it!"}
{"text":"We did the lunch time Summerlicious 2014 menu. My daughter had spring rolls for starter, vegetarian Phad Thai for her main. We both had mango ice cream for our dessert. The spring rolls were Ok. The Phad Thai was mediocre and the ice cream was quite nice.  I did mango salad, basil beef and rice, mango ice cream. My meal in general was pretty good. The ambience was nice . Staff were helpful and attentive. Not the best Thai I have had, but not disapointing either"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner last night and once again was extremely satisfied with the quality of the food, the service, and beautiful venue.   Btw Bangkok Garden is one of the only Winterlicious restaurants with a fully vegan menu option.   I started with the Tom Yum shrimp soup - 5/5 for taste! Omg I've had Tom Yum soups at a couple of other Thai places on Yonge street before and each time I left the broth untouched essentially because there was so MSG and tasted so artificial. I was very happy with the soup base here as it had a hint of coconut milk, which added creaminess and depth. My only complaint was how small it was! My friends also enjoyed their sausage and fried chicken appetizers.  The vegan main, a red curry containing squash and soft tofu, was disappointingly small, but ohhh so very flavourful and creamy with the addition of coconut milk again. I was so jealous of my friends' Khao Soi, which had an abundance of chicken and veggies.   Dessert was simple, but amazing. Order the vegan option even if you are not vegan as the rice crackers option was kind of underwhelming. The vegan sticky rice had bananas and black beans and was so aromatic and heavenly. Remember to top it generously with coconut milk... So frickin delicious.  Overall my only disappointment was how small the portions were for Winterlicious and it makes you wonder whether paying $33 might have been a bit ridiculous. However, it also goes to show how amazing the food was-- just couldn't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"Had such high expectations for this spot based on how much I drooled just looking at the summerlicious menu.  Listen. I love Thai food but this did not do it for me.   I got the spring veggie rolls for the app. It was very basic. Good but plain, you can get it anywhere. In fact you can get better ones at salad king down the street.  Entrée - curry pad Thai with vegetables. Uh.... this kind of reminded me of old socks. Very little flavour with lots of sodium. I picked at it until I ate all the tofu and veggies. The pad Thai used these glass noodles that are like, a dollar at any Chinese supermarket. Not a fan and did not finish.  Dessert - I had this sticky rice thing and it came with this weird egg texture looking thing with the tiniest bit of coconut milk dripped on it. Unappetizing- I didn't want it after two bites. I took the boyfriend's dessert, some chilli chocolate mousse and it was really good! Not light like regular mousse and had the spicy kick (the white people beside me were gulping water because it was too spicy lmao) but I liked it a lot.  Oh! Cocktails wise, we got the cucumber gin & tonic and the piña colada. Pina colada was too sweet and too little rum.   Highkey probably would not go here again but it's not 1 star. Super good service and very sweet. It was really slow though and we waited forever and it wasn't even packed. The place is gorgeous as well, bf said it looked like \"an Asian keg\"  Wasn't a fan of the food and would probably go to salad king instead."}
{"text":"I went here for the summerlicious dinner for $25 with some friends. The restaurant especially dining area looked nice from a distance. The space looked bigger with mirror finish on the walls. You can see lower and upper level seating as well as the stair case and birdcage motif. There is a lot of monotonous dark wood finishes though and not so pleasant looking dark green granite tables. The lighting wasn't very good either, especially at our table. Hard direct incandescent light made the food not so appetizing for the camera.  I ordered: Grilled Vegetable Salad Warrior beef Curry Banana Fritter with ice cream  The salad was disappointing for me. The taste is typical thai flavour of sweet sour salty fish sauce dressing with some spice. I should have known better but this taste was not what I was expecting. There was grilled vegetables but it didn't seemed grilled that much. More like marinated in sauce. I noticed there was a big juicy lemon slice and it kind of made the salad more sour... Not necessarily better. I felt the chicken wings looked a lot more worth it than this. The curry more than made up for the lackluster salad. It looked very plain especially compared to the duck dish but the taste was heaven! The coconut creaminess with soft thin beef slices accented by fried shallot oil was so satisfying. I thought there might have been too much sauce until I eventually put the all my rice in the curry. by the time I finished it, there was nothing left.compared to the other dishes available, this one is definitely recommended. For dessert, I ordered banana fritter with vanilla ice cream. By this time i was already stuffed from the main course but I had room for this as the proportion was modest: A simple small piece of deep fried banana and a small scoop of ice cream presented very nicely. Very much like comfort food as expected. I was satisfied. Compared to the mango sherbet served with tart fruit, I'm glad I got this.  The service could have been better. Being in a group of five, each serving came relatively the same time although particularly one dish always came a few minutes after everyone else's. Knives didn't come with the cutlery which was a concern because the duck dish was especially tough. The waiter checked up on us once although other than that, he was hard to find. Our cups of water were never refilled. When it came to the bill, the waiter did not ask us how we would like to pay for the bill. He just gave us a combined bill. Even after requesting for separate billing, he would assert that it would be fine like this (he did not confirm it was not possible to do this). When picking up the payment he was also not ready for any credit card payments either.  Overall, I don't think the Summerlicious promotion was worth it but I definitely would get that delicious curry."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening at 7pm, it wasn't full but there were tables seated, the inside was lovely decorated. While waiting for the rest of the party I sat in the lobby and the lovely spa smells next door and tv were a great bonus while waiting haha  I got the pineapple shrimp curry for $22, it was SPICY, i love spicy foods but this was extra spicy but delicious the curry was full of coconut milk flavour there were about 8-9 large sized shrimps in there with lots of pineapple chunks. The jasmine rice was also really delicious on its own and fragrant. I tried some of the \"two friends\" stir fry with chicken, beef and veggies and that was ok, not outstanding but not bad.   Service was good, we were checked on twice throughout our meal and water was refilled, no problems. Overall, a good place for thai food and decent price for the central location and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Really delicious Thai food with great flavors. Their service is so nice. I have a lot of food allergies and they were amazing about checking and making sure that everything in the kitchen was able to accommodate. I love their pad Thai, massaman curry, and they have great options for Sharing including the star of Siam for 2."}
{"text":"The food at Bangkok Gardens is not bad, they get bonus points for a cool looking decor and nice atmosphere. Definitely feels more upscale than your average Thai restaurant. Had the appetizer platter which has a few too many fried dishes. The curry was alright not a big curry fan in general so moving on. Pad Thai was also alright good amount of chicken could use a little spice. The beef dish was a little disappointing not super flavourful."}
{"text":"We went here for Summerlicious. For $25 we got an appetizer, main course and dessert. I had tiger shrimp as an appetizer. It came with a delicious peanut sauce. This was the same for the chicken. They were actually very good. My sister had spring rolls and she said they were alright, nothing special. We all got pad thai, however my sister got the vegetarian pad thai, while myself and my husband got the chicken pad thai. It was good, but pretty comparable to pad thai I've had....well, just about everywhere. The desserts were also alright. There was a special on drinks. Their signature Tiger beers were only $4 and they had excellent margaritas for $6. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice, but overall I felt like the food wasn't special enough to warrant the $25 price tag."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The first time my fiance took me here I was skeptical. It's in the downtown core in a mess of giant buildings. The entrance is nondescript. It just felt like it was going to be \"meh.\" Then they brought us to the back room where it feels like you're entering a mini, magical Thailand.   From there, I was blown away by the friendly service and excellent food. We have been back several times and loved every dish. I would highly recommend the red curry. On our most recent visit last night we had the Two Friends (beef and chicken) and I loved that as well.   This is a bit more traditional of a restaurant than Khao San Road, which also might turn some people off. But does every restaurant have to require a long wait and make you feel like you're not cool enough to be there? What's wrong with feeling comfortable and cozy, and as if the staff really want you to be there?"}
{"text":"They have a great lunch buffet.  A lot of people find it pricey ($15.95) for lunch but when you take into consideration the quality of the food, it is completely worth it.    The buffet has a decent selection (don't go in expecting a plethora of choices like those Chinese buffets in Markham) and all are of excellent quality.  A must try is their soup noodle bar.  You tell them what protein you want, what choices of toppings (e.g. spring onions, garlic, parsley, chili flakes, etc.) and they put it together in this amazing chicken consomme broth. End result is a fulfilling bowl of soup noodles - yum yum!  Their desert table contains an assortment of fruit, some traditional Thai sweets, fried sweet potatoes and bananas.  All are well prepared and a great way to top off the meal.  This is my go-to place when I am treating a friend for lunch, as the food is impeccable, the service excellent and the decor is beautiful."}
{"text":"Buffet lunch for $20 may sound good, but with the quality of food, I'd say it's not. The only thing I really loved was the fish curry and rice. The beef noodles actually felt a little off. The desserts were not that impressive either; the best would be the fried banana."}
{"text":"Although the restaurant is nicely decorated, the food is nothing special. Service was fine."}
{"text":"This is an old favourite of ours. We revisited Bangkok Garden after maybe...five years of not going. There was really no reason why we stopped; we've always found the food amazing. Tonight, I can definitively say that this is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto because of the variety, the authentic taste, and the ambiance. We recently took a trip to Thailand and this restaurant reminded us of a couple of great Bangkok restaurants.  I'm surprised by the 3-star average rating. While I must say that Sukhothai has been my long-standing go-to Thai restaurant, I think one can't really compare Bangkok Garden as it offers a lot of dishes that Sukhothai and the other places do not.   I say give it a chance - go for their regular menu at least once!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Average quality Thai food. I like salad king better...bc it's great food but much cheaper."}
{"text":"New chef from Thailand. New menu with old favourites and the flavour is back. OK guys I will be back."}
{"text":"Ahhh...how I long for Thai cuisine on a blistering cold winter's night. You will find this restaurant close to its partner company elmwood spa. I've been to the spa a couple of times but I remembered going to Bangkok garden after my massage and also the fact I didn't have to pay as it came with my massage package was a bonus. I loved the food and I liked the service.  Now I'm visiting after 2 years with no massage but wanting to try their food again. So I, reserved a table for 2 for my fiance and I as we wanted to try their regular menu.   The restaurant is beautiful and charming, wooden architecture fills the room with Thailand sculptures that accentuates their religion.   We ordered the app for 2, cashew chicken, siamese beef, and ginger fish. Everything tasted great but my biggest concern was their portion size and the cost of each dish. Most of the dishes were around 20 dollars and came with rice but the protien was lacking, I was disappointed. My second concern was the really slow service. Although they were polite, it was still very slow.   Lastly we had dessert, we shared the bangkok coconut cream for 8 dollars....the portion was so small! I would pay 5 dollars for it. NOT 8!!  In conclusion, I recommend dinning here if it's included in a spa package."}
{"text":"We went here for winterlicious. A group of 4 people just trying to get some good food. Man were we wrong. Instead we had some of the worst food ever. The khao soi tasted like it was Mr.noodles. The dessert was awful. It was a flavourless flan. Would highly recommend AGAINST this place."}
{"text":"I had the emerald curry with shrimp and it was fantastic! So creamy and spicy... it really hit the spot. The prices are a bit high, but I suppose that's similar to other restaurants on Elm. The decor and staff and marvellous; this is now one of my favourite spots"}
{"text":"I always judge a good thai place by their Pad See Ew (stir fried rice noodles with Chinese broccoli) It's my way of knowing if they're authentic or not because not many places serve this delicious dish! This place was....absolutely all wrong! The dish came saucy - not normal, it had nuts in it - not normal, it had bok choy and regular broccoli - also not normal. It was just BAD and on top bland - super bland. I was not a fan. The space was nice though, the staff was great.. I might try it one more time to see if the \"DRY\" version of this dish  is better? Never heard of wet or dry Pad See Ew - if you do have to go here, try the dry - hopefully it is tastier?? just weird.."}
{"text":"The food was not as good as I was expecting. Maybe it is because it was the winterlicious menu. We had the trout and pad Thai as main. Pad Thai was great. But the trout had some small bones and scale that was not removed and I could not really see them because of the dim lighting, wasn't so great having to find out while chewing the food. Also the curry that came with the fish was not enough to compliment the rice, I wish there was more, the curry sauce was quite delicious. The ambience is great. Noise level is high. I would want to try a regular menu next time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, their green curry is amazing and super tasty, but the chicken is dark meat not breast, and its a bit fatty, which ruins it a bit for me and the service isn't great.. Maybe they changed their chef since I last went a few years ago?"}
{"text":"I went to Bangkok Garden after reading the great reviews and wanting to try out a new summerlicious place. I was really dissapointed. The atmosphere was that of a hotel lobby, very empty, with little ambiance and a dark entryway.  We opted to sit on the patio, as the restaurant felt empty and awkward. We ordered the Tiger Shrimp and the Spring Rolls to start, the portions were extremely small, I couldn't beleive it. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for our main, which was surprisingly good, but not anything I would rave about.   The desserts were tiny, and not very good. I had the Thai Custard and Rice pudding, which tasted like popcorn, and was not great.   The location is right next to the delta chelsea, and feels mainstream, and that of a hotel restaurant. There were a lot of families, lots of tourists with children popped by. Not a great choice if you're planning on a date night or an evening with friends. It's not a place you would feel comfortable spending time and chatting. The wine list is extremely poor, with Jackson Triggs being their 'feature'."}
{"text":"It was a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. Beautiful ambience, very classy, good food and extremely friendly service. The portion size was decent and had a lot of variety for vegetarians. This place is good for groups and for dates too."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with co-workers recently. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the street and they are great for accommodating large groups. The ambiance is fancy-ish. Overall, it's A-OK. Service was fine and they were good at suggesting options for 2 vegan co-workers (veggie \"anytime noodles\", and a veggie curry dish). They did encourage everyone to just get the buffet, probably because it's less work for them. I think its' around $16 per person.   I got the buffet just because I was super-hungry and didn't want to wait. The selection was quite good. My favourite was actually the make-your-own-noodle-soup station. You get a small bowl of broth and they put in rice noodles, chilis, vegetables, and whatever meat or seafood you like. I just got chicken, but there was fish, shrimp, and some other choices. The rest of the buffet was decent, but not great -- it's hard to make buffet food very good. Still, the veggie cold rolls and mango chicken weren't bad.   I'm not sure if I would return (for Thai food in the area, I'd prefer Salad King), but for this kind of work function, it fit the bill."}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive and fast waiter service.  We enjoyed the dinner for two it was filling and quality!  Definitely a good size quality portion of food for both of us, and that's what I like!  We picked the Star of Siam and everything was so tasty.  We were there for about 2 hours.  Good beer selection (had the Hogtown Ale).  I consumed the hot Thai red pepper in my flavourful lemon chicken soup, and it was painfully good :). I also discovered that it cured my reflux (GERD), and now take a hot chili each day and I've never felt better :). Nothing else worked.  Ditched the prescription and I'm cured!  Thanks Bangkok Garden.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, plain, nothing to rave about.  Truly a \"meh\".  Always tables available.  No surprise."}
{"text":"I was here for their summerlicious dinner menu which was priced at 25$. The restaurant is very beautiful inside, not at all what I had expected when I was at the front door.  This is what I had for the summerlicious dinner: Appetizer: Grilled Shrimp on Sugar Cane Entree: Pan Seared Duck Dessert: Mango Sorbet  I was not a fan of the grilled shrimp on sugar cane. I had previously seen a picture of what this looked like and imagined the texture to resemble shrimp when cooked. It was mushy. It was actually a shrimp mixture, but not just the herbs added, it felt like there was some cheating involved, like flour or batter was used. To me, it was not a good mix as it made the final product mushy upon biting.  Pan seared duck was also disappointing. At first sight the plate looked like it was going to be the best dinner entree from their summerlicious menu (based on the volume of meat given on the plate). Upon eating the duck however, I retracted my opinion, as I had a terrible time trying to chew through the hard/tough pieces of meat. This is duck done wrong! In addition, they don't have any knives for guests to use... so I had to grind through a whole tough slice in my mouth. The tamarind sauce was good though.  And finally mango sorbet. It was pretty good. It was really just sliced fruits and a scoop of mango sorbet. Tasted sweet and tangy. It was good.  In my opinion the summerlicious menu did not seem very thai... maybe fusion. Overall though the portions are quite good. I left very full. I did not appreciate, however, that our server came with one bill, and refused to give us separate bills when requested."}
{"text":"I had my first winterlicious lunch here the other day.  I'm always on the hunt for great Thai food so I was excited to try out a place that I wasn't familiar with.  I didn't know they had a buffet when I booked my meal but was convinced into having it instead of the winterlicious menu.  A simple review of the food would be - great curries, average to poor noodle dishes (including the pad thai). As is typical for a buffet, some of the dishes were getting a bit dried out and cold when I got to them and although I liked the selection, I half wished I'd tried the menu instead.  The atmosphere is very nice, but the service was quite poor. An interesting architectural design and various Thai art touches add to the place but when our meal was over it was near impossible to pay our bill. We realized that our waitress had left and no one stepped in to help us, or even let us know that our server had changed.  It was difficult to rate this, and maybe I'm being unfair, the curries are very good here and I still enjoyed my meal, I can just think of many better locations to get Thai food namely my favourite, Mengrai Thai, and its neighbour Golden Thai."}
{"text":"Came here for a small work dinner on a weeknight. It wasn't too busy so getting a reservation wasn't a problem. The place has a nice ambient environment at night which is good if you are thinking about bringing a date. The menu has a lot of options but I ended up going with the pattaya grill which came with an order of rice as well. It was delicious and I would definitely get it again. The meat was tender, the sauce had a great tang to it and the portion size was large and very filling. With respect to service, our waiter was attentive and our food came out in a reasonable time. I've also heard this place as a great lunch time buffet with a lot of options."}
{"text":"Love dining here. Fantastic atmosphere with water fountains, tranquility and a sense of being away from the city (and some where exotic). The food speaks for itself, quality ingredients that Chef William blends to create innovative dishes.   Been here many times ( they are baby friendly!!). Great lunch buffet deal that can't be beat but more recently visited last week for their Chili Festival and it blew my mind! Was the perfect date night for the hubs and I and there was options for everyone. Some mild dishes and some really really spicy dishes (which we loved!). Great cocktail called Red Eye to Bangkok with vodka, tomato juice and.. STEAMWHISTLE.   This is an upscale Thai restaurant and not a take out joint. Fits in with the fantastic calibre of Elm St restos. Definitely a go to spot for us!"}
{"text":"tl;dr the food was OK but the service was slow and unfriendly  Atmosphere: Bangkok Garden is decorated quite nicely in the interior (once you walk past the bar as you walk in) with dark woods, low lighting and Thai flare. If I had to describe it in one phrase I might say, \"1990s Thai temple\" - the dark wood, gold buddha and sparse lighting remind me of some of the Thai temples I have visited.  Staff and Service: the front staff, who I assume included the manager, were incredibly friendly; unfortunately, the rear staff (including our server) was quite a different story. It took ca. 20 minutes to be served water and an additional 30 minutes to receive our drink orders. Once we received our orders, several dishes were prepared incorrectly and the server proceeded to blame us for ordering the wrong dishes, etc. (when this was not the case!). In the end, the dishes were re-prepared but not without some hostility and resistance from the waiter. I found this surprising as we were a large party (willing to leave a generous tip!) but the waiter did not seem to care.   Food and Drink: Food was OK. I wouldn't say it's the best Thai food I've ever had but not the worst. I ordered the Pad Thai (a staple and what I would say is the \"stamp\" of any Thai restaurant) - the noodles arrived clumped together as if the dish had been sitting for a while. Flavours were marginal at best and the presentation was slightly sloppy.  Overall impression: Unfortunately, I wouldn't return to Bangkok Garden; there are far better (and less expensive) options in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"I came here for a ladies lunch with the girls from work and had no clue what to expect. The reviews here are varied and some people love it and some people don't. I generally don't like Thai food but since I didn't choose the location, I didn't have much of a choice so I jumped in when the opportunity presented itself.  This is a really interesting looking restaurant. Lots of wood, an upper level and lots to look at. Like no restaurant I'd ever been in before, that's for sure!  We went for lunch - it seems all they have is the lunch buffet, which is what all of us went for. They had chicken wings and springrolls, mango salad and beef and chicken dishes and lots of different kinds of noodles. I tried all of it and it was all very tasty, but the stand out dish for me was on my second pass of the buffet when I got to the curries. MAN Tamarind curry was incredible. Just soooo tasty. I want more...The shrimp ball curry was good too but the shrimp balls were a little weird to me. I'd rather just have the shrimp tossed in there.  The dessert table was a bit odd since most things werent' labeled. I tried a very gross sweet rice dessert (and everyone else tried it after me and agreed - they spat theirs out) and some very tasty fried bananas and sweet potatoes with honey for drizzling.  Overall, I think the price per person was around $18 with tax, so not a cheap meal but considering its a buffet style and you can keep going back, I think it was pretty good. They don't have a ton of selection so if you don't like what they've got, you're kind of SOL. I'm not sure I'll be back here unless someone else picks the restaurant but I'd happily come back and partake on the buffet."}
{"text":"Most of the stars is for the decor, which is pretty nice. The food itself wasn't bad, but for what they charge and the area they're in, it's not that well balanced.  As is with most parking downtown, it's not easy. There is street parking available near the restaurant, but depending on when you go, you might have to walk a bit.   The restaurant is pretty big, but you don't realize it until the hostess brings you into the dining room. The ceiling is high, and the decor is mostly wood, with large bird cages attached to the ceiling. It's a somewhat earthy vibe, which kind of resembles the temples in Thailand. There's also a fountain and pond and stuff so that makes the place look even fancier - good job on the decor. It's actually a pretty good place for groups since they are so spacious, but doesn't get overly loud.  Onto the food: try the basics first, because if a restaurant cannot handle the basics properly, you might want to think twice about returning. The satay and calamari were okay, at least when I went. The satays however were a tad salty; the calamaris were better - crispy, fresh, and flavourful. The tom yum soup wasn't the best I've had; the spiciness kind of overpowered the other flavours. Their curries are okay too but the flavours weren't that prominent; presentation though was nice, just like the restaurant (seemed like this place is more for looks than taste...). Lastly, when at a Thai restaurant, you have to get the banana fritters and/or mango sticky rice for dessert. These two weren't 'wow', but had the generic taste as most other restaurants, so that was okay.  Service was meh... our server, at least, seemed a bit snippy. Not rude, but snippy and kind of impatient.  Would I return... maybe to have a drink or to hang out with friends to enjoy the decor."}
{"text":"So delicious! They happily make anything vegetarian for you. The banana dessert is amazing!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the city.  I would love to go more often but the price is at the higher end (considering there's cheaper options).   But all in all a nice place"}
{"text":"The time I wanted to eat here before was on a day they were closed which myself and my stomach were quite disappointed about. Going back the second time for dinner, they were open. Inside, the restaurant is quite dark and classic, not very on the modern side. It gives a really warm and comfortable feel. My boyfriend and I were seated right away at a nice little table with a tea light. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful when we asked questions.   I ordered the Emerald Chicken Curry (I think that's what it's called) and it has peppers beside it on the menu, meaning that it's a spicy dish. Our food came pretty fast, about 10-15 minutes are so which is good for 6-7 PM when it's dinner time and the restaurant was packed. As for my curry, it was spicy as indicated on the menu but full of flavour. As for a coconut lover, there is a very evident rich coconut flavour which went very well with the rice on the side. The chicken in the curry was perfectly cooked, vender tender and juicy. I overall loved the Emerald Chicken Curry! Unfortunately, it was too spicy for me to finish it so I took it home and ate it for lunch the next day, which tasted still quite amazing.   This restaurant is a little on the pricier side, but the quality of the food represents and reflects the prices very well. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I know that Bangkok Garden has been around for a while and is a popular place, but I found it to be expensive for they offer.  Back in March, I tried their Tamarind Beef Curry (Gang Masaman), which was okay."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for the winterlicious special, it was $28 for dinner per person.   When we first enter the place looked like they were empty, but they lead us to the back and it was quite full. The decor and interior was really nice. There were two floors and two servers per floor.  For appetizers we ordered the calamari and the chicken spring rolls. The calamari was a bit soggy and the spring roll was decent. They came at a reasonable amount of time.   Main course however took a very long time. It took us an hour,I've seen other ppl get their orders quicker than us.  I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the goat Currey.  Because of the delay the manager gave us shrimp cocktail s, however my bf does not eat shrimp. I thought it was nothing special.  My order was alright, the portions are big and they did not skimp out on the shrimp. However I would say it's only slightly better than Thai express but definitely not worth the 1 hr wait nor the price.  For the goat currey, the taste was just okay nothing special. My boyfriend did say the rice was hard, I took a bite and agreed. The rice was either old rice or it wasn't cooked properly.  As for the dessert, they came at a reasonable manner, I got the cassava cake and the boyfriend got the white chocolate rice pudding.  I tried both and thought it was mediocre, nothing special . It's like something you can get at the Asian supermarkets ."}
{"text":"We didn't order a whole lot, but what we ordered was spicy and delicious. It's unfortunate a lot of people haven't had great experiences here. Either they've upped their game or the food differs from dish to dish. We ordered the pad thai. Quite decent. The warrior beef curry was excellent--tangy and flavourful. Husband and I couldn't get enough of it. Creme brûlée was average, but then it's a thai restaurant. It's upscale with good ambience and the service was attentive. Prices are high but I guess you're paying for the upscale ambience"}
{"text":"We went here for a co-workers goodbye lunch. the lunch servcie is a buffett. The food seemed to be replenished quickly which was good, so it for the msot part tasted pretty fresh. The service was OK, friendly - water was refilled quickly but not overly helpful. They recommended a lemonade which tasted pretty gross. way tooo tart.   the food in the buffet was substantial and had enough variety for vegetarians and non. I love meat so i ate everything. Having just come back form thailand a last month i can say that it wasnt as authentic as i had hoped. We left full. and for 14.00/per person plus tax and tip - it wasnt soo bad. I didnt have any dessert. I also wished i had had the chance to try the soup bar as it actually looked like the legit thai soups...but i didnt get a chance.  The decor is pretty awesome in here though. Feels like a thai palace."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunches for years, and it never disappoints.  The buffet doesn't have a huge number of choices, but the food is always great.  The noodle bar in particular is fantastic.  The price is reasonable, and the service is good.  A favourite of those working in the hospital district."}
{"text":"In spite of the praise being doled out by fellow Yelpers, I found my experience at Bangkok Garden underwhelming. To be sure: the service is great and the atmosphere is grand and regal, but the food left much to be desired. My pad thai (the standard by which I measure all restaurants Thai) was low on flavour and the chicken and shrimp were overcooked. My date's dish (a veggie Summerlicious offering) wasn't much better. For gourmet Thai, I wasn't impressed, especially considering the steep price tag.  Obligatory Title Pun: Not a lot of BANG for your buck.  Menu Readability: Good. There are lot of offerings, and everything is clearly laid out and well-described.  Need to mention: It's a lousy sign when you're both rolling pieces of deep fried soy in your mouth wondering what that weird taste is.  What this place teaches me about myself: I can't not order pad thai at a Thai restaurant. It's my crutch."}
{"text":"I went to this place for summerlicious 2016 with two of my friends and found the portions to be a little small in comparison to other restaurants with the same prix fixe menu for dinner. My friends and I each ordered different items. I ordered the coconut tempura shrimp (comes with 3) as my appetizer, the weeping tiger as my main course (flat iron beef with veggies and rice), and banana fritters (literally just fried bananas) as my dessert. The shrimps were really good, and my main course was decent but definitely not filling. I was a little disappointed with the banana fritters as they were very dry and the described caramel and honey were just spread underneath. One of my friends ordered the Thai chicken wings as her appetizer which were also good, but my other friend ordered the duo rolls which she did not enjoy. For their main courses they had the glass noodle chicken pad Thai and the pan seared duck which were both good. For dessert one of my friends had the pandanus rice (not very good and very small), and the chocolate chai mousse which is extremely chocolatey, so if you're into that you'll probably like it.  All in all the food was decent but we all agreed the portions were a bit small and the desserts were not impressive at all. Good service though, and the waiters accommodate you to the best of their ability. Also, if you're going for dinner, you can park for $5 at the Chelsea Hotel if you show them your Bangkok Garden receipt-- definitely a plus when parking downtown."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurant in toronto. I've been visiting this restaurant for years. Ever since my high school days. I love the food here and the service is extremely friendly.   The decor is really nice, the place is pretty dim and romantic. Good place for a date.   Food here is pretty good. Their Tom yum soup is on point. It's not too sour and not too spicy.   As for the dishes I usually order. I usually get the seafood friend rice. This dish is extremely delicious. There is plenty of seafood in the dish. The flavor is good. I would definitely recommend it if you like seafood   If you like curry, the curry here is also pretty good. They are creamy and strong. Complements the rice well."}
{"text":"Tried the full summerlicious menu with family. The food was pretty standard Thai food you'd expect from any Thai restaurant. The mango salad app was tarty and very fresh, and probably my favorite dish. The mains were all mild-med spiciness level to suit most tastes. Average food, but decent portions and excellent service! The atmosphere is really pleasant and very clean establishment.  Great for groups or intimate dining !"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. Hadn't been for at least 5-6 years ago. I remember at the time, that I was very impressed with the joint - great atmosphere. Very large and authentic looking restaurant. The food (from what I remember) was good too. That was before I went to Thailand several times...  There are very few Thai places I will go to now, after experiencing the food of the nation - in the nation. Pad Thai is a particularly sensitive issue for me. I always get excited when I hear \"original\" or \"authentic\" pad thai. We were there for winterlicious and was not impressed (nor was my stomach after).  Real Pad Thai should not include Ketchup or Tamarind. This pad thai didn't have ketchup, but did have tamarind. Traditional pad thai should go something like this - http://importfood.com/recipes/tstirfryNoodle.html (watch the vids, all options work). You don't even have to visit Thailand to learn how to cook yourself real pad thai. I digress though, food was so-so at best.  An authentic Thai experience is difficult in the city (please share if you know one). Some of my recommendations for Thai/Malay cooking include: -Curry Pad Thai or Oyster-sauce noodle (can't remember official name) at Bangkok Paradise on Queen West at Portland -Singapore Rice Noodle at Basil Thai kitchen on Danforth near Woodbine -Ankor on in Chinatown east (Gerrard St)"}
