{"text":"Outstanding!  Glad to have this place in Waxhaw!  Service from hostess through servers was excellent!  Good menu and food was outstanding!  Great selection of beverages too... expected Guiness on tap, which they do have of course.  But they also have Smithwick's and others.... wonderful!  Awesome to have \"Smittick's\" with their fish fry, corned beef or anything on the menu.  Topped if off with a shot of Tullamore Dew... nice hoot and a holler for Mary O'Neill's!   Well done, very well done!"}
{"text":"Great Irish pub - food  terrific (fish n chips -so good). Great staff and good service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love It here.  Food, drink, service is always spot on.  Separated into two narrow sections.....bar and sit down restaurant.  Room comes at a premium but is a proper pub."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Waxhaw!  Mary O'Neills is a great pub with super atmosphere and good Irish food.  The beer selection is perfect - thanks for serving Smithwick's, yum!"}
{"text":"First time here, our food was excellent, service was great, and it seems like a fun place!  My first good impression was their unsweetened iced tea that actually had some flavor; one of my pet peeves is restaurants that have nasty unsweetened tea. Their menu has a pretty good selection of choices, and I very much enjoyed every last bit of my corned Beef and Cabbage. I loved this place and yes, I can see where it could get a little loud. Regardless, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We have been there on several occasion (8 times) and sadly, we have been disappointed on each occasion. Even after their start up problems, it did not improve. It is to loud, the food is poor but the atmosphere is nice. Everyone around us was shouting at each other, it was madness. We have tried many of their dishes and have found the burger to be the best thing they had?! The fish and chip had no taste, it is a pub?! I have enjoyed real pubs in England and Ireland, this is just not even close, even when the food was just okay, it was a pleasure to be there. Waxhaw needs a pub, but this restaurant is not doing it."}
{"text":"We went to Mary O'Neill's for Mother's Day brunch...the food was authentic and good however we had to wait an hour to get it and the restaurant was not busy.  The other problem was they don't have a kids menu.  Being in downtown Waxhaw a kids menu is a must have in all venues.  I will go back again but probably just to sit at the bar and I will make sure to be full when I arrive because I was starving by the time our food arrived."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised, the food is pretty good here. Hubby had Bangers & Mash and loved it.  Fish & chips were great, thick solid pieces of cod & not flimsy or over battered.  Fries are the kids new 'favorite' & they had burgers which were pretty great! Fine for kids (a 'partial wall' separates the bar from seated eating, but it's still a pub/tavern like place even if small).
Servers all friendly, they are still getting some kinks ironed out, but they try really hard!
Like everything in Waxhaw, come before 6pm if you don't want to wait for a table.
Waxhaw has needed a place like this & still needs more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple times now and formed an opinion that it's a great place for a drink and some great pub food. Pint of Guinness will run ya $ along with one order of Mary's 'Nachos' does the trick - a great place - where nobody knows my name :-)"}
{"text":"A terrific new place in Waxhaw.  We went there & were surprised to find such a great tasting burger and a really nice food selection in a pub. We have been a few times & have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent! Small gem with amazing food. Will be back later this evening for entertainment."}
{"text":"Mary O'Neill's is a great Irish Pub, in downtown Waxhaw, with a lot going for it in their second month of operations. This evening we made our first visit and were pleasantly surprised. 

The bar is a large section of the over all restaurant and provides  a warm comfortable feel with friendly faces, exposed brick and a great beer list.  The down side.....it's noisy as hell to diners on the other side.

Brittany G. was our server and provided insight and perspective into the limited menu. She was quick to promote the future menu but proclaimed 
\"we're getting good at this menu before we let it grow!\". Great move by ownership to walk before you run.

My Bride and I shared a bowl of the Potato & Leek soup. Although served piping hot and thick, the flavor left us longing for the savory flavor of leek...in a word bland.  The soup was served with warm soda rolls and they definitely stole the show....could have eaten a basket full.

Unfortunately our entree's were served 2 minutes after the soup...start ups are a challenge!

My Bride ordered Mary's Classic Ruben and I the Shepherd's Pie and we both had a similar reaction...\"where's the beef?\". 

The Ruben was constructed of thinly layered thinly sliced corn beef with a generous portion of kraut and thousand island dressing . The marbled rye was a perfect compliment for this traditional concoction. 

My Pie was a tasty, although an unbalanced combination of beef and lamb with peas and carrots and a VERY generous cover of mashed potatoes. The ratio of one part meat to three parts potato left me clamoring for more of the meat filling.

Although new this eatery is a great location, smart management, engaged people and a memorable Irish theme which will make Mary O's a place to go!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and it was ok. The fries were soggy but the fish was good. It has a nice bar with a good selection."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Mary O'Neill's on Saturday afternoon. We ordered 3 burgers, sweet potatoe fries and onion rings. The burger was fresh and delicious not to mention the roll it was on. I would have to say it was one of the best burger I have had in a long time. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fish and chips for New Year's Eve and I'm back again on the 2nd. This is an authentic Irish Pub in downtown Waxhaw. the food is great and you can actually have a conversation"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and wanted to go more often however, there always seems to be a line. Food is good. Small place and the noise is a little loud but it's what you expect at an Irish joint!"}
{"text":"I got a chicken sandwich and it was decent. My family got fish and chips and didn't like it at all. Also the noise level in there is so so so loud you can't hold a conversation or even hear yourself think. I left with a massive headache. I heard they were working on possibly fixing that. Which is why I gave 3 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is very fun. Good music, good food and good beer. The Corned Beef &Cabbage entre is fantastic. Great bartenders too."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat or have a drink or both! Can't say enough positive things about this phenomenal  Irish Pub!! 
5 stars you guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in mid afternoon the other day.... as it has been good before but sooooo noisy.  3:00 was a better time for the noise.  They still have their original \"starter-up\" menu... but promised it was being upgraded. 
My colleague had a Lamb burger and I had Shepard's Pie...  small plate.  The burger looked good and he said it was... and since he was a Greek.. I believe  him.  the Shepard's Pie was excellent.  irish Tea was also very good.
Some things on the menu... regular burger... at $14 seems a bit pricey.. but that's just me I guess being persnickety."}
{"text":"Everything was great. I had fish and chips. The fish was fresh, cooked perfectly and flavorful. Hubby had buffalo wrap (the Irish one in the bunch) he said it was good! Chicken wasn't dry! My sister had the Mary's nachos! She loved it.  And is was a big portion. Everything was big portions. Highly recommend! Staff were welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"First time for wife and I so we came for a weekday lunch.  A-OK and good enough to bring us back.  A real pub, for sure.  All the signage, the bar, decor and a true Irish pub menu.

All of this was shared with the wait person.

Irish whiskeys by the glass, so taste yourself silly. Quite a variety.  Plus good old Guinness.  I ordered a black & tan, usually Harp beer with the Guinness floating on top.  At first I thought that the bar tender had given me a plain Guinness.  The wait person, who could have been Mary herself, told me that their black & tan is made with another dark beer other than Harp or some other light colored beer.

It was OK, but in the future I will just order a straight Guinness.  Just me.

I had the fish and chips, receiving the largest hunk of fish ever.  I was concerned that it might not be cooked through, but it was!  And like many other reviewers I thought it very good.  It is Icelandic cod, so to me you can't get cod any colder body of water and the meat was firm, white, tender and flavorful.  

The chips, on the other hand, were heavily salted with a seasoned mix.  Way too much.  I mentioned it to the wait person who suggested that I order the chips plain.  That is my recommendation to you.

Wife had the smoked turkey wrap with onion rings.  The turkey was truly smoky, so if you are not into smoke, go slowly here.  The wrap was generously portioned and tasty. 

The onion rings appeared to be possibly right out of the freezer box and they were terribly over-cooked.  Dark brown and were not flavorful at all.  Wait person agreed that they were over cooked.

So...will be back as we want to take on some of their traditional Irish specialties.  We have traveled extensively in Ireland over a number of visits so have a point of experience.

On our list of to-try food items are the Sheppard's Pie and the corned beef and cabbage.  And start tasting those whiskeys.

We want to experience their entertainment as there is the offer of craick (crack) on their signage.  In Ireland craick is witty conversation, jokes, etc.  And the craick is part of the evening entertainment where a small group of musicians play and sing traditional Irish tunes.  Quite a bit of fun so if you have the opportunity, go for it.

Of course, alcoholic beverages tend to liven up any craick."}
{"text":"Great pub with friendly service and good food, and proper Guinness pour! Gets a little loud when busy but nothing reminds you more of a pub atmosphere than some social noise:)"}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub with Big taste, atmosphere and friendly service with a small town feel.  St. Patrick's Day tent party was a blast, clean and well organized for everyone.  Don't pass this place up and if there's a wait it's worth it! Sláite"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and nice addition to Waxhaw. My wife and I went there and had lunch. My wife's burger came out like a hockey puck. My lunch however was excellent. The owner came over and couldn't be nicer! Anything can happen when it's a new place. I wish this establishment nothing but the best and hope they are around for a long time."}
{"text":"So we've been waiting a while so they could smooth things out and today was our first try. We started with the Potato and Leek Soup. I could tell it had Potatoes in it but the Leeks were nonexistent except for a few dropped into the center of the cup. I was looking forward to the Freshly Made Irish Soda Bread that came with the soup. . I saw they had an app of Bread that came with Assorted Butters so I was expecting some sort or butter with the bread...WRONG!  The bread was at Room Temperature and unfortunately so was the SOUP! We sent it back to get HOT SOUP. It came back and was the right temperature. The waitress said the ONION RINGS were made IN HOUSE so we ordered them. Maybe I'm wrong but I've never seen House Made Onion Rings that were so evenly and perfectly battered. Usually Onion Rings are made with Large Male Onions so each one is Big, Round and Thick...these were SMALL and THIN with not much flavor. On to the FISH & CHIPS. The Fish portions were large and the French Fry portions were also. The Fish was fried until the Breading was a Golden Brown...puffy and light. Unfortunately it was tasteless but there was Malt Vinegar!  The Sweet Tea, on the other hand, was definitely SOUTHERN. Hope you get the Back of the House straightened out.
See you in SIX MONTHS, maybe..."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meals.  Fish & Chip, Stout Burger and Ruben were excellent.  Great beer selection.  Guinness pour was perfect"}
{"text":"Fish was great! will keep going back"}
{"text":"Service was spot on with quick drinks and never missed a chance to prebus dirty dishes.  Potato leek soup was quite good.  Rueben rolls were an interesting and tasty twist on a classic Rueben.  The sauce with the rolls lacks pizazz, pretty much colored mayo.  Nachos were tasty and a good size for an appetizer, the cheese sauce is good but beware that the meat is has a bit of tang as it is the shepherd pie meat.  The burger was very good, great mix of flavors, excellent grill flavor.  Look forward to another visit, and welcome to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Can't not say enough about MaryO'Neills. Great service. Amazing food and atmosphere. The fish and chips are really good. The fish is huge and you could share this entree.  The best appetizer is the Ruben spring roll. The best thing of Mary is the drinks. My favorite is a snakebite and they make the best one yet. If you come to Waxhaw you have to try them out."}
{"text":"Food was good n nice size. Only problem it's to high for its lunch menu. A sandwich n beer was 19.00 before tip"}
{"text":"To be fair I was here a couple weeks after opening and had a very good burger. Not the best but worth the trip. The wings are also good. Today my wife and I had burgers (on my recommendation). They were over cooked, tough, dry and frankly tough to swallow. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I have been here at least four times to eat and once for drinks only. I usually went in the afternoons to avoid crowds but they are always busy. That says a lot in my opinion!  
I enjoyed it very much each time with exception of one time. 
Big misunderstanding between me and my server because I was having lunch with a friend and wanted to take an entree home to my fiancé who was working from home. I wanted it to be warm when I took it to him but she brought it out at the same time as my lunch was served and my 2nd glass of wine. I tried to explain to her that I wanted to take it home warm and get it AFTER I had lunch and drank my wine. For some reason she couldn't not understand and next thing I know the manager was at my table and I had to explain it again.  So he apologizes and takes it away and in Less than 10 minutes he brought it back!  I was enjoying chatting with my friend and had barely eaten half of my lunch...and had not drank much of my wine. We were not in a huge rush!  So this upset me because I did not want to go into it again so I asked for the check and a box for the rest of my lunch. I took a couple of sips of my wine and left half a glass behind. Even with the manager giving me a 10% discount my tab was $76 before gratuities. When I got home I had to warm the entree up. AND it was not even what I ordered!!!  I ordered the Stew but  Shepherds pie is what was in my bag. Big disappointment because we had both already tried that and thought it was too dry but had not tried the Stew. I was upset and said I would never be back... And I haven't but I think I will soon because I have been craving the Rubin rolls!   It comes as an appetizer and it is so sinfully delicious. There's not many items that look appealing to me on their menu. But the ones I do like are very very good. Which is was why I really wanted to try the stew. I feel like this was probably an isolated incident based on the popularity of this place."}
{"text":"Good food! Good beer n fun!!! Welcome to waxhaw!!!! The Reuben rolls are not to be missed, the burgers and the wings and the water tower salad also delicious! But my favorite is the fish and chip!"}
{"text":"It's categorized as an Irish pub. So, some Irish music can be heard and some of the people that work here look like they are full blooded Irish. Also, they serve Irish beer like Guinness. It's down town Waxhaw, North Carolina and located over the railroad tracks. 

Customer Service:  My waitress was the bartender who I felt wanted to forget about me because she wanted to talk to her regulars sitting at the bar who were probably friends too. As a matter of fact, she did forget about me. I had to take my drink up to the bar to get a refill on sweet tea. The second time I asked her if was easier for her to get a coke since it's behind the bar where as sweet tea is in the kitchen. I told her I wanted coke, she still gave me sweet tea. Also, I had to order a drink from her via another waitress. 

I have a feeling this is a small town who is weary of out of town people like myself. So far, I have noticed people being nosy. Like way to nosy, such as where are you from, what are you doing here? I'm getting tired of theses questions every where I go. And I got it from here. 

Menu items ordered:  8 Oz steak burger, fries and a sweet tea. Sever stated they do not have pickles. I asked for lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese on my burger. Results; plenty of lettuce, lots of cheese, I couldn't see the onion or tomato at first because there was barely any on my hamburger.

In summary, service could have been better. My burger could have been better. However, I did enjoy the trip out to this little town way out in the middle on no where."}
{"text":"The vibe is perfect. Street-front pub with great food! Well-poured Guinness, tasty Apps and killer fish and chips! Large servings and a delicious thick cut of fish. 

Why not 5 stars: My wife and I stood at the hostess stand for upwards of 5 minutes before being seated and then, after being seated, had another 5-7 minutes prior to meeting our server. So, I went to the bar and ordered our drinks.

Even still, I can't wait to go back again. I'd hope this was an isolated incident because I'm afraid the frustration of the wait could drive folks away from some great food and drink! 

Do yourself the favor of stopping by with an empty stomach and a thirst for a pint o' Guinness!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in Waxhaw. Everything we ordered was excellent. The service was great as well as the atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town and the staff is so friendly. Great place for a drink or dinner. It has become our go to spot."}
{"text":"I've only been to Mary O'Neill's a couple of times for drinks and apps. The apps are pretty good, definitely better than your average bar food. They are almost always packed so finding seats in the bar area is difficult and it's a very small space so typically standing room is limited as well. The usual crowd that is there is very friendly and easy to talk to if you are looking to spark up a conversation. Last time I went the place smelled great, although every time the kitchen door opened huge clouds of smoke seeped out. I don't understand how the staff good see or breathe! All-in-all I like the place and will continue going. Hopefully, next time I'll try some dinner menu items."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try Mary O'Neills and they absolutely met our expectations!  Food was piping hot, fresh, and delicious and the beer selection is fantastic! Restaurant was very clean, the bar is lovely and spacious, and the service is very attentive and friendly.  Fish & Chips are not to be missed and their burgers are made fresh and are juicy and seasoned perfectly. The only miss for me was the Tarter Sauce...it tasted like fancy mayo, not Tarter Sauce."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and service are great. Finally a place that stays open past 10pm in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"I had heard rave reviews about this new Irish Pub in Waxhaw. I had high expectations, and sadly I was disappointed with my experience. First off, it is very busy on the weekends...which is a good sign... it seems like a lot of people love it. But, because it is so busy, it is so LOUD! There definitely needs to be some noise absorption panels or something on the ceiling because it was so loud, I couldn't hear anyone from my party speaking and I felt that we had to shout the whole time. Also, because it was so busy, we did not get the best service. We rarely had anyone stop by our table and so we weren't able to order as many drinks as we would have liked. We ordered Buffalo wings as an appetizer and we received BBQ. We had to wait a long time to get them swapped out. I ordered the shepherds pie, and I love shepherds pie! Unfortunately, the patatos were so hard and cold, that they lifted right off the ramakin in one whole solid piece. Underneath, the lamb mixture tasted premade and was lukewarm at best. My husband got the regular burger and it tasted very bland. The fries were okay, but nothing to write home about. I will say that the Irish servers were very charming. I also enjoyed that I was able to order a snake bite, which is draft Guiness and cider. I am hoping this was just an off night, I have high hopes for this pub!"}
{"text":"Perfectly local and the perfect stomping ground for a good drink and fish and chips; as close as I've been to the real thing!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner. Didn't mind the wait. The wait staff was awesome. I had the Sheppard's pie and my wife had the salmon. Other entrees at the table were a burger and Rueben. The food was well prepared with good presentation. My only complaint is the cost for the portion size. The Sheppard's pie was served in a small dish barely 1\" tall with a small amount of meat and a pile of mashed potatoes. It cost $14. Usually it would be served in a large deep bowl half filled with meat. It tasted good but wasn't hot. The salmon was a good portion size but with a small amount of vegetables. It cost $18. I like shepherds pie but wouldn't return there for one unless it was served in a bigger bowl with a larger portion for the price."}
{"text":"I waited a bit after Mary O'Neill's opening to try it out.  The family and I went on a Monday night, when typically businesses in Waxhaw are either closed or not very busy.  It was pleasant to see Mary O'Neill's was busy but not packed out.  The bar are was full but there were tables available. We were seated at two two tops that were pushed together along the long banquet wall.  Our waitress was nice and answered our questions.  There was no beer list offered with the menu, but our waitress had one and I got a very brief look at the beers that they have, including my personal favorite, the White Zombie from Catawba Brewing.  The current menu has about 10 items total.  We were told that this was their trial menu and that a new menu would be coming.  The place has been open for more than a month now, so it seems strange that there isn't a more complete menu.  There are a few apps, some sandwiches,a couple of plates,  fish and chips and the obligatory shepherds pie.  My girls both ordered burgers and the wife order a ruben.  I took a chance on the shepherd's pie.  The burgers looked great and came with choice of sides.  One daughter took sweet potato fries the other regular.  My wife ordered sweet potato fries as well.  The fries were tasty as were the burgers, but the order was a bit on the slim side.  My shepherd's pie was good, but not nearly worth the $14 price tag.  The dish was tasty by very small on the portion.  I noticed a gentleman next to us make a same comment on the size vs. price of this dish.  Another small peeve.  Everyone except me ordered water as their beverage.  Water at O'Neill's comes in a glass milk bottle with these tiny little glasses that you have to keep refilling if you are eating.  Suggestion to management.  If a guest orders water, bring them a full glass of water, with ice.  I know it is trendy right now to serve water at the table in the milk bottle as I have seen several restaurants start doing this.  But, if you are eating a meal, drinking from a 4 ounce juice glass isn't going to work. Overall, Mary O'Neill's is pub first, restaurant second.  The folks in Waxhaw rave about  this place and I am sure that in time things will get better.  Figuring out the true identity of the place (bar or restaurant) would be a great first step.  Repricing the menu would also help.  We will stick to Maxwell's or The Olive or Bistro Antonio for now though."}
{"text":"Stopped by on  Monday night around 7- 7:30 pm.  Bar side was pretty full, but the other side was pretty much open.
Everyone on the staff was very nice and friendly.  Started with the Rueben rolls?, which were very good.  There were 3 in our party and we ordered Fish and Chips, Shepard's Pie, and a Burger ( the one with bacon and the pepper jack cheese ).  Food was tasty, but their timing needs to be worked on a little.  The only dish that came out really hot was the fish.  The other stuff wasn't cold, but the fries were not hot.  (That's my simple, but accurate barometer on timing). The burger was tasty and cooked to a perfect med-rare as ordered.  My only suggestion on the burger would be to go with a different cheese.  I love spice, but Pepper Jack just did not compliment the otherwise really good burger.  
Overall, this is a welcome addition to Waxhaw.  You can tell this is a new establishment by watching the flow of the service and interaction between the staff.  Especially between the bar and other side of the room.  Awkward service or not, the main thing is that they are nice people.  The rest can be figured out with time and experience.  Hint: Go to Maxwell's and do what they do."}
{"text":"Finally was able to check out Mary O'Neill's.  The location is a welcomed addition to bring some more options to Waxhaw for food, drinks and fun.  The bar is gorgeous, nice pub atmosphere that reminds me of Europe, but it is very small - so I understand why it's been so crowded all the time.  

Wife and I went in early during the week and were seated quickly - the next part lost a star for this review - we were brought water quickly, but then waited about 10 minutes with no other interaction from the staff.  So we went up to the bar instead.  

The bartender was very friendly and helpful - though he was incorrect about the chicken tenders being fresh - they are just frozen.  That with the high beer prices dropped the second star.  

We started with the Fondue - and it was pretty good - the texture is a little gritty but it had a good flavor with the warm chips.  The tenders were very boring - standard frozen chicken tenders.  The fish and chips was pretty tasty though - the piece of fish was HUGE!  

The batter is the traditional fried breading.  The fish was cooked well - moist and hot and not at all dry.   

We might try dinner again if they aren't busy but the bigger appeal is the wonderful bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is the nuts...the authentic Irish food ... the staff... the ambiance.... the town .... best in class"}

{"text":"Great food and super nice people. The atmosphere is pleasant and the restaurant is noticeable clean. 
Totally would recommend to family and friends."}
