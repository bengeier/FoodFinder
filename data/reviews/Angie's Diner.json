{"text":"So convenient but not worth the trip. After several years of coming here And being told that they have ran out of a particular dishes! I decided it wasn't worth coming.The lemonade or punch is always good. And that definitely deserves one star. And depending on what waitress you get and if she come in with a good attitude or not... you may get mediocre service. For now I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Authentic grandmas southern cookin right here
Fried shrimp was perfect tartar sauce was good green beans were seasoned mac and cheese was the best I've had ever anywhere. Look at my reviews you'll understand the weight that carries. Lemonade was great .$8.73 for full meal sides and drink. 
I'm way far away
If this was closer I'd probably eat here everyday for lunch it's that good
Please understand I slam everybody 
Not this place 
Worth a far trip
Just don't have anywhere to be waitin for it to come out lol"}
{"text":"Real country. Real good. We ordered fried whiting, fried wings, Mac and cheese, black eyed peas and green beans. How can you complain about a place that has pig feet and red Kool aid on the menu? (I don't eat pig feet, just making a point)"}
{"text":"I had opportunity to actually make 2 visits to Angie's. The food was actually pretty good. In terms of traditional soul food restaurants Angie's for me would rank towards the top for Charlotte. The place is rather small so both visits I got mine to-go...LOL Turkey Wings, Fried Croaker and BBQ Ribs can not be touched at Angie's. Not sure yet if I wanna try the pig's feet but will let you know if I do."}
{"text":"For soul food on the west-side, Angie's is pretty decent. After having lunch there, I actually had her cater an event for me and everything was delightful! Baked chicken, mac n cheese, green beans and rolls. The location is like a trailer and is pretty small, but don't let that keep you away."}
{"text":"I came in one morning for breakfast to meet a client.  The meal was good; but the place had a stinch smell of spoiled water. I didn't see a health code posted either. The coffee was really bad!   I even left samples of my gourmet coffee to have her serve to customers to try out as a new product to the menu.  She didn't!! 
As good as the food was--I won't return. Between the smell of spoiled water and not listening to customers wanting to help you improve on your menu items...I prefer not to eat here. That just shows you don't care enough about the customers that frequent your business.  Maybe she'll listen to Robert Irving on the show \"Restaurant Impossible\""}
{"text":"Ate here twice before and food was good. This last time however the lady at the counter continued to ignore me when no other customers needed their order taken. When I asked to be served the lady snapped at me and told me she would be right with me while she continued to text on her phone. Lastly found roach in food!!!! Never again! Ghetto hot mess!!! Go to Sunset Soulfood instead."}
{"text":"I just ate there today and the food was AMAZING.  I love soul food and this blows La'wans (which I still love) out of the water.  The yeast rolls were not the crappy grocery store rejects a lot of places give you, they were hot, fresh, and buttered.   My chicken was perfectly crispy and the okra tasted like it didn't come out of a bag from the freezer section.  The creamed corn was great too!  Also, the tea rivals Pressley Park, which according to  a ton of articles and reviews has the best sweet tea in the state/region.  This was definitely the best soul food I've had in a while!  It's kind of in the 'hood' but come on...where do you expect good soul food...Ballentyne?"}
{"text":"Fried chicken, Mac n cheese & green beans were delicious. Not really a sit down type of spot but what it lacks in decor it makes up for in quality. Almost forgot the lemonade wz BANG'n"}
{"text":"Love Angies. One of the best soul food restaurants around. Everything I've had has been good except the candied yams which are way too sweet. And they run out of food if you come at the wrong time.  But, wait a little while 'cause they have another batch in the oven.  Price is very reasonable. Not open on Saturday or Sundays anymore which is when we would usually go."}
{"text":"Really good soul food! I came here to eat for lunch they were out of numerous menu items good thing they still had my Mac N Cheese! Waitress was cool. Only thing is they had flies.... it was a little small but still cute. If they had everything I wanted to order from the menu & not just one thing I'd give 4 stars & 5 stars if the fly buzzing around wasn't trying to eat my food."}
{"text":"The food here is realllly good.  Reminds me of the old Coffee Cup(the orginal, when the grandma still worked there).  Now that being said..understand this is a \"hood\" place.  They are going to be loud and there will be hollering and gossiping(ususally at each other and the other long time customers).  The building is a old mobile home. This is not the place to take your boss, but take yourself and anyone else not stuffy and you will enjoy it.  My faves are the tilapia and perch,greens,yams, cornbread, and the cakes."}
{"text":"Now, the scenery isn't all that great. It just looks old. The food was good! Great service! They have Koolaid!!! I love that! I'm an Koolaid expert. The waitress kept calling me baby. What man doesn't like that?"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Walked in at 10:33 and the woman rudely said you're 3 minutes late for breakfast.  Then I asked if you are closed and she said no. But lunch wasn't being served until 11. So you are closed then? Well we are not serving for a half hour. Thank you won't ever come back to this dump. One would think folks would be flexible in this day. 3 minutes?"}
