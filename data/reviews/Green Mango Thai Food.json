{"text":"service was friendly.  Pho was not the best, but the Bun with spring roll lunch special was delish!  The spring roll was light and crispy - amongst the best I've had. Oh, and the satay sauce was great.

As it is so close, I may go back again for lunch sometime.  But I'm not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place serves cafeteria style vietnamese-thai fusion food.  The service is fast and efficient.  The portions are huge.  I usually do take-out and I guess when I do take-out the food is pretty comparable to that of Spring Rolls across the street.

I recommend you go to Sushi Club around the corner instead.  For the same price range  you get something that's made fresh.  Or, if you want something fast there's a McDonald's nearby too."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with a new friend.... never liked pho but decided to try it again. This is the first pho that i like... it was pretty delicious... i think the only thing i didnt like was that when we decided to stay and eat they kinda looked irritated, even though they hadnt even started on our food yet."}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for these guys, as it was my first taste of \"Thai Food\" as a youngin', and they have filled up my poor and tired student (and post-student) belly on more occasions than I can even really count. With portions big enough to sustain even a champion eater like myself, I have been known to even stretch my leftovers into tomorrow's lunch (with the help of my always-busy rice cooker).

The \"nicer\" sit-in location, and its quick take-out counterpart (located across the street from each other) are...oh wait, no longer located across the street from each other. You could say that they have joined to create one huge, super mango power, but it's more like the take-out joint has switched bodies with ye olde sit-inny(?), and then the other body was destroyed. 

Anyway, I think they provide great value for the money spent, and an easy, quick way to fill yourself up in the midst of any Yonge St.- centric tasks you may have to complete (but please, keep them to yourself). And though I have never been to Thailand, so I really don't know any better, their choices of noodles, rice, and a number of meat and veggie \"items\" to add to them, have a tastiness and quality that I can always count on, visit after visit. Always say \"yes!\" to the salad and nuts on top. And to the fresh rolls on the side, if you're really trying to prove something."}
