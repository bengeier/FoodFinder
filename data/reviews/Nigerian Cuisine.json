{"text":"When I called to get hours of operations, the person that answered was having a full on conversation with someone else and barely acknowledged me waiting on the phone in between sentences. They were very friendly when we got there.  Food was ok but I thought it was overpriced.  I ordered the vegetable soup with pounded yam and specifically said no stock fish. My soup showed up with stock fish. I barely touched my food. My husband's egusi soup was better. At the end of our meal we were slapped with a $15 bill for stock fish that was put in our soups and we didn't really touch. My son requested no meat in his okra soup and guess what,  he got a bowl full of meat that he refused to eat.  Ok experience but not enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Ordered online through Yelp, did not receive confirmation of order, called restaurant and the response was \"we don't have a contract with Yelp so I don't know what you're talking about.\" Placed the order anyhow to pick up 1 1/2 hours later. Arrived at restaurant, which is very much a whole in the wall type of place, no a/c, lights were not on, and no one in the place. Rang the bell for service and was greeted by a woman who told me that the beans were not ready and that if I wanted to \"wait 20 minutes they might be ready, but probably won't be ready for a while.\" She then asked if I wanted the half of my order that was ready. I said no thank you."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in an old shopping center south of Tropicana on Maryland Parkway. The dining room is small with three tables. Two of the tables accommodate 6 diners and the other table seats four.  We ordered the jollof rice with lamb. My wife ordered the plantain dinner with catfish. Everything was fresh and cooked to order. This was my first experience with food from west Africa and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"On a visit to Las Vegas with my hubby. Found them on internet and disregarded their internet reviews and still went ahead thinking they may have changed. Honestly, the lady who claims to be the owner has a very bad attitude. She gave me a very cold meat, to start with I ordered goat meat and she gave me sth else. When I complained, she started ranting. This is the only place a customer does not have the right to complain when you don't get what you asked for."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of time the food was awful. The service was terrible who wants to eat when the wife and side piece are arguing and calling the police."}
{"text":"Great naija food, I ordered their jollof rice, vegetable soup, stewed Goat meat, pepper soup, and they all hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place is a ripoff. The food is the worst Nigerian food I have had at a restaurant and the portions were extremely small for the money you post per plate. I have no idea how this place status in business."}
{"text":"Save your money and dont eat here...  First of all nobody welcomed us or sat us, and it looked like they didnt have any lights on coz the ambiance was very dark. A gentleman came and took our orders, and told us it will take 10-15mins for the food to come out coz we were a little pressed for time as we had an appointment to be at in 1hr. Anyways, as you can guesss... the food took 1hr to come out. And after waiting all that time and missing our appintment, it tasted horrible! This is not African food, coz real african food doesnt taste like this. Im sooo mad I left the strip to come eat here but at least now I know to nver eat there again."}
{"text":"Very authentic experience!  I had clients who turned me on to Nigerian food and Nigerian Cuisine did not disappoint right down to the style of restaurant...  Thanks guys.."}
{"text":"This was a first taste of Nigerian Food and we loved it!!!  We didn't know quite what to expect and most of us ordered fish.  I ordered the spicy meat soup and selected fish as the meat. I thought it was excellent.  Angela, one of the owner's was very helpful.  She said they recently took over the restaurant and it's name is My Joy Nigerian Cuisine.  If you are in the area it is a must try.  We found the price to be very reasonable."}
{"text":"All 3 stars go toward the taste of the food.  If you're eating here DO NOT COMPARE IT TO AN AMERICAN RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.   You have just traveled to Nigeria.  It is a hole in the wall,  there is no decor, no greeter to seat you, no time limits on food.   Throw everything you know out the window.  Eating here is an experience and chuck it up as that, just go in,  humor them, eat your meal and be out because it is strictly about the food there not the dining experience.   Their food is very flavorful.  A bit expensive for the amount of meat given and the variety on the menu is not always available so they may try to pull one meat off for another, but if you were in Nigeria they'd probably do the same so it's okay, it's all part of the experience,  LMAO.  Bottom line: of all your senses, your taste buds are the only ones that benefit.   Enjoy. .. I did"}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!! Nothing short of nostalgic! We ordered multiple dishes, and each was beyond amazing!! Great place. Been several times before when we visited vegas but this is first since new management!!! Lady and her husband knows what they are doing!!!! Must go!!"}
{"text":"Just DONT! Was visiting Vegas briefly and went here with a friend straight from the airport. I yelped Nigerian food and both Chiamaka and Nigerian cuisine came up. I chose chiamaka because they had better reviews but came to find out they are one and the same...Go figure.  First off, no customer service whatsoever. You order at the counter and after haggling over their non-existent choices of meals and poultry (beef beef and beef) the young man tells me my order is going to take 15min. 15 mins turns to an hour and I'm sitting there staring into space. No one checks up on me nor updates me on my order. Enters the food...simply put, it was the most ridiculous mediocre expensive piece of crap ever. I ordered jollof rice & egusi soup and it was a complete Rip off. So unpalatable I couldn't eat it.  I peeped behind the counter and agree with other yelpers who say the kitchen is dirty. JUST DONT!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent....however....we waited over an hour to be served. Make sure you call in your order 45-60 minutes before you arrive. Overall it was a nice experience, if I go back I'll make sure to call in advance!"}
{"text":"Delicious! When in Vegas my taste buds crave and appreciate an outing to Nigerian Cuisine. Comfy, so-so decor, but yummy food! If I wanted decor, I'd be in Ikea, given that its stomach that is doing review 4 strong stars. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the whole Grilled catfish through Uber Eats.  Should have read reviews first... Order took a total of two hours and still didnt look fully cooked.  Had to call Uber support then then sent it over. It was so oily it leaked over driver's car.  Fish was pinkish inside and fell apart easily.  The smell was very off putting so no one ate it.  Malt was also forgotten."}
{"text":"Gurl Bye!!!! We couldn't even get past the telephone conversation about what they had or didn't have today!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review places, I'm a patient person and can endure a lot but my goodness, the service here was so shambolic .. bad customer service in terms of very disorganised, promising times that are not realistic, & on top of that the wait times and service time between ordering your food is like 1hr 20 mins minimum, FACT! And then another thing is the neglect, not checking if your food was to its satisfactory needs and all this with the ladies pathetic apologetic manner, apologising for dumb ass stupid mistakes, getting orders wrong, not listening properly, she really needs to learn that! The food is good but for such pathetic services it's not worth the price at all.  Honestly if u have absolutely nothing to do and have time to waste then please feel free to go and enjoy the crappy services & good food .. as for me, I'm never going there again!"}
{"text":"Good food...I recommend Egusi with Eba, Fried Rice with Goat Meat & Plantains. Good service with a smile! I also recommend ordering before you go, it takes quite some time to prepare. We call before we dine in and carry out."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood driving by and spotted a sign for Nigerian cuisine in a little ethnic strip mall. Wasn't really hungry but shoot I've ever had Nigerian food before. I'm curious and I pull over and pay the restaurant a visit. I enter with who I assume is the owner is watching Nigerian TV is also the cook and server. She tells me that they've been open for six weeks. I peer over the menu, unfamiliar with everything the owner recommends jollof rice with choice of stewed meat: goat chicken, fish, beef or a mixture of beef and goat. Craving something more gamey opted for the goat and wash it down it a Vitamalt (Nigerian coke).   She heads back to the kitchen after taking my order and out she comes with one plate containing a rather slim, boney portion of meat and another plate containing the jollof rice topped with several slices of plantain. I'm disappointed by the small portion of goat in comparison to the larger rice plate I receive. Strangely one portion of the goat is falling off the bone tender while others are a little tougher. The rice on the other hand is nice and fluffy, reminding me of Spanish rice. The plantains are nicely cooked with their bark brown caramelized edges. Solid. Decor is sparse with the exception of a flat screen and considering that I was the only patron in the restaurant, I would've liked a little more attention. Seemingly a little distant, I got the vibe that perhaps she wasn't used to seeing an Asian cat dining at a Nigerian spot. All good though, I'll be returning soon as I'm in that neighborhood every week. Hopefully I don't face the same experience next time I try their other offerings."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have ever been to. Was in Vegas last month and I called to see if they were open and they never answered or picked up (should have been a sign) I drove all the way from my hotel because their website says open at 10am. I arrived there at noon and the doors were closed. I peeped through the door and saw a guy in there and I knocked to make him aware that the group was waiting outside the scorching sun. The nonchalantly comes out and says \"we are not open\". Very poor customer service not explaining why they were not open nor did he offer to bring us in to at least sit down. Another guy comes out 30 mins later and says there were open. We walk back in and I see a different guy and I politely ask him \" Are y'all open\" and he replies \"Is the door open\"? What an asshole I will never be back here and I hate it because I think they changed owners. The last lady that run this business was such a sweetheart and one of the reasons I wanted to go back there. These guys better roll up their sleeves and behave because with such horrible customer service they will close down sooner than later. BEWARE............"}
{"text":"Amazing food - we ordered a special vegan jollof rice with spinach. It was delicious and spicy and we loved every bite. Excellent value for money - we will be back!  PS: The two servers, Angela and MJ should get awards for customer service! SO kind and friendly and polite. Thanks so much!!!"}
{"text":"Love the goat Egusi and the ogbono paied witg foo foo. Great service. The staff is friendly. It is always best to order ahead of time if you are dining in. Takes a while. Other than that, love, love. Even my 10 year old son enjoys the experience of eating with his hands!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the bad comments are coming from :( ... I thought the food was good! I had the egusi soup with gari and it was delicious!! The male waiter/cook was super attentive and attended to us promptly. My only complain would be that the suya wasn't what I expected. Everyone should try it at least once though!!"}
{"text":"I ordered food and got there and the lady who took my order wasnt even there. The food was never even made. And i was on my way to the airport. The unprofessionalism of this place is way beyond my words. I was so upset. And THE PLACE SMELLED LIKE A DEAD RAT. MAYBE this was a sign and i would have gotten sick. Nasty ugh. And terrible service."}
{"text":"This place changed ownership in June 2013 and thankfully changed cooks. I have been here several times in the past few months and have been forced to taste more exotic cuisines.  The food is actually very flavorful. I have had the egusi with pounded yam,  plantain plate, jollof rice, and meat stew with goat meat. Each time my hesitation was met with delight and maybe a slight taste of hesitation.  The new owners have changed the decor (thankfully) and provide entertainment in the form of a big screen TV.    They strive to create a place to commune and enjoy good food and great company. The fifth star is missing due to lack of a liquor license at this time."}
{"text":"Located right next to the Indian market in a plaza just south of the university, this restaurant is a little treasure. Actually, it seats a fair amount of folks, but I was the only diner Thursday afternoon. I had the lunch special--a huge plate of jollof rice and plantains and two large and meaty chicken drumsticks plus a can of soda for eight dollars."}
{"text":"Do not go to this eatery.I repeat do not go eat at this establishment. My girlfriend and I went here looking for goat meat and got the worst food and service ever.First they did not have anyone to sit anyone or greet guests as they entered the restaurant.The onwer lady came from the back and sat us.They took a long time to take our order since there was no wait staff.When the food got there it was all wrong.The owner had said its goat meat.He gave us goat stew which had fish in it.We did not want any fish-he kept concinvicing that there was no fish-just stock fish(whats' the difference?)There was little meat to be had and plenty of stuff you did not want.Also when addressed the owner wanted to argue with us.Wrong!you never argue with a customer.I wanted lemon in my water for a little bit of taste.He did not have any so he went to the store and bought limes came and cut them up and tried to pass them off as lemons.Am not dumb I know limes from Lemons-get me some Lemons.The food was so-so to so-bad.Service was awful and not worth the expensive ticket meal.The Menu was not extensive and choices have to be offered for a complete dining experience.Do not go to this eatery at any rate.#atyourownrisk!"}
{"text":"Food does not equate the price they are offering. If you do decide to order your food to go make sure you check your food for quality before leaving."}
{"text":"Well I was happy to eat amala ati egusi iyan naa fele dada aaa ,matin pada laipeee"}
{"text":"This is really my first time trying a Nigerian restaurant and I can honestly say that the food was delicious. I had the whole tilapia with the jollof rice and it was wonderful. If you are in the Las Vegas area I strongly recommend this place."}
