{"text":"First off I would like to say that after seeing this restaurant for so long I was excited to try it out and had my expectations set for a wonderful experience. Well everything except the server crumbled all that. We were a party of four and ordered many appetizers, entrees and drinks without the cost being a factor. The crab which was ordered was dry the 2 ribeye steaks were dry as well and didnt resemble a ribeye,  and the other main course was an entree with shrimp and the shrimp were surprisingly small and few which didnt justify the price. Overall very dissapointed the only ok tasting thing were the dozen oyster which were served with 2 lemon slices and ofcourse had to ask for more which no one shouldnt have to."}
{"text":"Slow during Sunday lunch, hostess sat us immediately. Hostess was chewing gum and wearing white and pink socks, very visible. Upon sitting our server Maria came over before we completely sat down and asked us what we wanted to drink before we looked at a menu. She left dirty plates on the table. We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was great. Ordered the crawfish bread and gumbo, both HORRIBLE. Talked to Maria about the gumbo because it was supposed to be the Shrimp and sausage gumbo but no sausage was in the dish and the server said it doesn't come with it but the menu says it supposed to(very important to know your menu as a server). Talked to a manager Marcalla and she was accommodating."}
{"text":"I am from California and grew up having great sea food.  My husband and I live in Las Vegas now 10 years and I took him to Landrys for dinner with our children. I ordered a shrimp, fish, crab ,and oyster plate.   The food was horrible.  It was extremely fishy . Good quality seafood is not fishy at all.  The fried oysters tasted so bad I thought I was going to get food poisoning.  Everything is mostly stuffed this and that. Almost no pure seafood.  It seemed like it's was bad seafood the would just make into a patty or stuffing for the crab and other items to cover the lack off quality. It was also extremely salty.  I don't understand why they are in business  in Las Vegas . I think they get all of there business from tourists off the strip.  As a local I will let you know  Vegas is way better than this......   I cannot  express enough how bad it was .   I think it is the worst food I have had in my life.   I think the good ratings about the restaurant may have been posted by employees or the corporate office.   So please save your $120. Plus dollars and choose another location .  You are probably safe with any of the upscale hotels with seafood restaurants so you are insured a wonderful experience.   Also , our service was very slow and the watress switched  the  glasses when she brought  back drink refills and it wasn't  noticed until they drank out of the others cup and got grossed out .  If they take the cups for refills and don't bring back clean cups they better make sure they are going to the correct person. Oh, gosh we had to ask for place settings even after dinner was brought. The managers just stood around watching the disatisfied customers bit did nothing to help out in anyway. Over all they shouldn't be in business. I don't want to give them even 1 star."}
{"text":"After having read such great reviews and not been there for several years, we tried it for an early Mother's Day lunch. SO disappointed! The decor hasn't changed at all from the time it opened that I recall, which made the lighting at the tables difficult at best (for aging parents). Service was standard, nothing special. Food was fair. I thought I had tried the lobster bisque before and enjoyed it. Not this time - way too much cream & no lobster! We saw a lot of fried seafood options and a lot of shrimp. The 'stuffed' choices turned out to be mostly stuffing and very little seafood at all. Definitely will not be returning for seafood again. I'd rather pay a bit more and enjoy the meal. Nothing here to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"$70! For 2 kid size portions! My husband and I are originally from Louisiana, so we were excited to go to Landry's for some of our hone town favorites. However, we were deeply disappointed. I ordered the fried seafood platter and my husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips. My seafood platter was extremely small and unseasoned. I have never seen a seafood platter that small before. I literally had 5 French fries, 4 oysters, 4 shrimp, 1 stuffed shrimp, 1 small piece of Basa and a stuffed crab, a few strings of fried onions. This was for $23.99. Now way was this platter worth that amount. My husband was also very displeased with his amount for the price. We have visited Landry's in New Orleans, LA and Lafayette, La. The size of out plates there was enormous well seasoned and worth the price. We were completely shocked with the Landry's in Las Vegas. This is not the restaurant we once knew. Something needs to change because our experience is not the 4 star Landry's we experienced with the restaurants in Louisiana. The chefs in the Las Vegas restaurant need to take lessons from the chefs in the Louisiana Landry's. You must season seafood! It's complete garbage otherwise. For the price portion size should not be the size of a kiddie plate. Presentation is also a must! Out food looked like it had been thrown on a plate, no neatness at all. We defiantly would not recommend the Las Vegas location or visit again. Serious changes need to be made with this restaurants chefs/cooks. They need to be given instruction on how to properly cook and serve Landry's dishes."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner and saw Landry's. Got Immediate seating at 8 pm in a booth. Kyle was server and did an excellent job of explaining menu. I got Mahi and wife got crusted shrimp. We both had a cocktail expertly made and numerous refills on water. Kyle is a former Marine (young) and I am an ARMY vet so we got along great. Stop in and Thank Kyle for serving and enjoy the meal. People who discredit this restaurant need a lesson in good food tasting"}
{"text":"My meal was excellent, the service was excellent, the staff were all extremely friendly.  I travel to Vegas for work a few times a year and will definitely be retuning here on my trips.  I went during the middle of the day and was greeted with a big smile and warm welcome by the hostess.  My server was Sparky and he easily provided the best experience at a restaurant I've had in Vegas.  The food was great. As with all things in life you get what you pay for.   The manager (Hi Rich!) even took some time to drop by my table and chat for a few minutes and make sure my meal was to my satisfaction."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this weekend.  I arrived a few minutes late for our reservation but our guests were on time so they had been seated already, almost 15 minutes and their drinks hadn't arrived yet so immediately we were concerned because the restaurant was maybe 25% occupied.  The waitress arrived and she was very nice and took our drink order, which was a bottle of white wine.  This particular wine is not expensive but was under lock and key for a manager to get so this took a good 10 minutes.  Concerned.  The waitress arrived with the bottle and glasses and apologized for the delay and it was fine with us as she seemed to be making an effort.  She took our appetizer order and we went ahead and ordered entree's not knowing what to expect.  We opted for the \"fried\" portion of the menu as that's why we went here.  Fried is not something we do, so we thought it would be fun and to allow the kids to try something new.  We had Gumbo all around, chicken and sausage.  They were generous, small bowls. and everyone did like it.  Salads were good also.  I had a wedge with blue cheese, which is something I may have once every couple of years.  It was good.  The fried shrimp entree's arrived and everyone again seemed to enjoy.  I'm from the gulf coast so typically I would order a fresh fish, blackened with vegetables.  We all knew we went here for fried.  I've lived in Vegas twice, totally 15 years and the only word I've heard about Landry's locally was on Yelp prior to making a reservation... Which is great, but if you don't hear some local chatter, that's usually a sign to maybe consider something else.  Our table got off to a slow start but got into a comfortable rhythm as far as food delivery. There wasn't a lot of team work to help clear the table as dishes were completed.  The first beer glass was still on the table when we left if that tells you anything.   I will go back for sure.  It's a nice dining dining room.  The staff was friendly and the kitchen did a good job.  I may even attempt the fresh fish next time, or something a little more challenging for the kitchen.   We all know ordering fried doesn't have much merit but it was fun food and we did enjoy it.  I know this restaurant has been here for years so I do believe they're doing most things right.  Would I recommend?  Yah, I would based on this one time experience, but I couldn't recommend anything outside my own personal experience as of yet."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and good-sized portions. Place has a nice atmosphere leaning more towards being a casual place, with low-key service as well.  Our server was friendly and let us change to fries with our grilled seafood plate.  Bread was good but you have to ask for it, and it says so on the menu."}
{"text":"Does not measure up to Joe's Crab Shack  Or red lobster or cafe alto or fish market  but waitress was great"}
{"text":"Excellent food, even better service, and a beautiful ambiance.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to go for seafood. We would visit several times a month. However our last three visits were subpar. Im not sure if there is new management or kitchen staff but the food quality has gone from excellent to fair."}
{"text":"Took a friend to celebrate for her birthday - she loved the lobster tail - said it was great.  I tried one of the specials that included a warm spinach salad which was one of the best I've had.  I'll have to go back and try their bisque after reading the reviews.    Our meal was leisurely and the place wasn't busy.  I wasn't expecting packed in a town where so much cheap food is available.  But I will have to say our waiter was excellent and the food was better than many places I've been.  The parking lot was easy access and plentiful - both a plus."}
{"text":"Make sure you ask for Mariano.. amazing service, he knows what he is doing. He was personal to our needs and always made an smart effort to make sure our experience was way above excellent.. we will be back for more"}
{"text":"Service wasn't an issue, server and the rest of the staff were very polite. The food just wasn't up to par considering the price. Lack of flavor and didn't give that fresh seafood taste either"}
{"text":"Went with my BFextrodrinaire for dinner to compare & contrast our previous experience with Joe's Crab Shack.  Actually, the 2 places couldn't be more different, but our intent was to sample the lobster bisque from both places and see if we could arrive at a consortium regarding its preparation.  To start, I ordered the \"seafood stuffed jalapenos\"...with \"Landry's seafood stuffing inside jalapenos with cream cheese and jack cheese\".  In a word, DELICIOUS!  Came piping hot with obviously scratch ranch dressing and crisp, not soggy onion strings.  I would definitely order these again.  Next, we both had the lobster bisque.  Hands down, Landry's beat Joe's in my mind.  More creamy, more real (not artificial flavor).  For the entrée, I ordered the jumbo lump crabmeat salad with pico de gallo and herb dressing.  My BF ordered the ribeye with a lobster tail.  He seemed to enjoy both of his surf & turf.  We shared the lobster tail and came to a draw.  In our concurrent opinion, Cappo's on west Sahara, serves the best prepared lobster (on special only) of all!  I tried a small sampling of the crab salad I ordered.  Was so full after the stuffed jalapenos and lobster soup.  I was so looking forward to the marriage of the lump crab and pico de gallo.  Unfortunately, all I tasted was crab and avocado.  Maybe the pico de gallo got lost in the richness of the crab or maybe the kitchen neglected to include it in the mix.  That and the measly ration of herb dressing, (along with a surplus of tomatoes...was that all they had in the kitchen for garnish) was enough to say that I wouldn't recommend this salad.  All said, my BF had an interesting observation.  As we waited for our appetizers, one look around the room showed the wait staff, obviously working in concert with the expeditors and bus people, a truly diverse work force.  I have no doubt, that a walk into the kitchen would reveal the same amount of diversity in the people preparing your food.  Amazingly enough, this diversity was also reflected in the demographics of the people frequenting the restaurant.  Not a one-note wonder from staff to patrons.  No one working there had to master a single language to transmit menu orders.  Kudos to the mgmt staff who recognize diversity and all that it has to offer.  While it's probably lost on most of their patrons, it was a memorable and noteworthy experience for me.  I should add, this place is ubiquitous or morphable., i.e. it could be your meeting place with your grandma after church or be a nice date place with someone special.  I really like this place for what it is and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the service was poor. I can't say what the issue was, as the restaurant was not very busy the night we visited, but I don't think our waiter has found his calling!  Unless you are just wanting to eat at a Landry's, or don't want to go out of that area of town there are much better choices."}
{"text":"So if you come here for happy hour, the bartenders are top notch and they will do anything for you including making a special margarita for you.  They have great service and great bar food, but if you are going to order from the regular menu, beware, I ordered a 35.00 Halibut and it was horribly dry and tough and gluten free options on sauce are not available!"}
{"text":"I went to Landry's for lunch to try and give them another chance to prove themselves. Typically once a year I come into the restaurant to see if they have improved their menu items, the quality of the food or their prices. Sadly, every year I'm disappointed. I have to stop this self-experiment and just give up on them.   The customer service typically has high marks, but the restaurant itself fails miserably in several other areas. The lunch menu is essentially made up of deep fried unhealthy food. If I  wanted all this deep fried style of eating I would just visit Long John Silvers. It is such a disappointment. If you want something fresh and grilled it will cost you an arm and a leg. If you want something off their lunch menu expect it to be fried. Prices are outrageous for lunch and the portion sizes are embarrasing.  Today I ordered the Blackened Mahi Sandwich..($16) of course the only side item options were either deep fried french fries or deep fried onion rings. I asked if they could sub a salad for the fried options. \"Of course,\" was the reply, but wait... It was going to cost $4 extra.  While waiting for my salad and sandwich I was presented with an undercooked loaf of garlic bread that when opened still contained cold butter and was not warm at all.  The meal experience was worsened by the arrival of my Blackened Mahi sandwich. The presentation was absolutely unappealing. The oversized plate (with the un-ordered fries/rings) dwarfed the appearance of the sandwich. But to my surprise it was not just an Illusion, the actual size of the fish was ridiculous. They should name the sandwich the Blackened Minnow to more accurately describe its size.  To make matters worse the sandwich was not even prepared as described on the menu. This led me to return the sandwhich and order the gumbo.  The gumbo was another sad attempt to make an appetizing dish. It was essentially a bowl of soup with a small dollup of white rice. The taste resembeled Campbell's Tomato soup with a few pieces of sausage tossed in.  Another disappointment.   Overall, the annual trip to Landrys proved once again that they can't provide a delicious, unique lunch meal for a good value."}
{"text":"I eat out at alot of mid line and fine dining places..I took my son to Landrys 3/3/2016 for lunch ordered crab crakes, calamari, oysters Rockefeller and chicken alfredo lunch was just under $100.00 definitely  NOT worth it at all.The food was at best the level of a sub par buffet and I wouldn't  have paid $30.00 for that lunch..The food is poor quality and funny tasting.Went there  wanting a high quality meal very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at a Landry's in 20 years. Sorry I waited so long. I had the plank salmon and my wife had the apple jack sea bass. Both entrees were excellent."}
{"text":"I am an avid lover of seafood so I was pleasantly suprised to find this place! They actually have an all you can eat Alaskan crab leg deal for $50 on Tuesdays so Ill have to come back to check it out. The service and oysters were excellent and I enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here one night late after a show and were not impressed. There are so many awesome places to eat in Vegas that the dinner we had here seemed \"okay\" at best. I had the scallops and my husband had the stuffed shrimp. Both were \"ok\", but not great. We were also quite surprised to see posted in the window that this restaurant  had just received a \"C\" rating from the Health Department the day prior.  Again, with all the fantastic food in Vegas, this place fell way short."}
{"text":"Oh my, best meal in years!!!! Everything we had was awesome.....a must in Vegas!!!! We had the Trilogy with the wood planked shrimp, and the dessert was awesome..."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Gilda is so professional and knowledgeable with great suggestions on what wine to have with our meal. She really knows how to make her customers happy. When quality of food is down, I always feel it can be made up with excellent service, Gilda won us over in this area!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Sunday for our anniversary . Restaurant not busy. Service good. My one peeve is they don't tell u that the ice tea is bottled, so no free refills . Next time I'll ask if they have brewed tea. We had the crab cake for 13 bucks little small , but tasty. fried calmari was good. I had the broiled platter  it had shrimp, scallopes and fish don't recall what type of fish w a butter sauce and a Parmesan risotto, the platter had alot of food . The wife had the Chilean seabass w Madrid sauce , she liked her dish . We had their version of banana fosters ( vanilla ice cream wrapped in a crepe topped w/ bananas and caramel and whip cream.) not bad but the traditional is  better . The entrees came with a salad which was nice . Overall it was nice experience. I like it better then red lobster , but not as much as McCormack & schimicks , which was my first choice but it's closed for lunch on Sunday ."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing.  For dinner had Salmon Filet on Plank, which was okay.  However, when the \"famous salad\" was brought to table, it was literally drenched with dressing.  I had to request a salad WITHOUT DRESSING, as I am weight conscious.  Should have been asked if it was okay to serve salad with their dressing, perhaps offering oil and vinegar as a substitute."}
{"text":"Let's see, $40 for crab legs that aren't fresh.  I thought I was at Red Lobster.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went to Landry's for the first time last night. I was apprehensive about the service in this restaurant because I had heard from many people that service was incredibly slow. However, it had been a few years since I had heard that so I decided to give this place a chance since the food was supposed to be good.   As I walked in I notice a big blue marlin in the restaurant. It was dimly lit and had a very nice vibe. It took about 5 minutes to be seated because unfortunately no one had answered the phone when we called. We were seated and had a wonderful waitress, Amanda Prosciutto (like the ham). She was very friendly, bubbly, fun, and very attentive to our table throughout our whole dining experience. The food was a little slow coming out but she kept coming over to our table to keep us informed about what was going on with our food.   We ordered the paired appetizer of spinach, crab, and artichoke dip and the crab and shrimp fondue. Both were good but the artichoke dip was especially delicious. For dinner I ordered the tilapia bianca. It was delicious - lightly fried, with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, shrimp, and scallops in a nice white buttery sauce. It was served on top of a cheesy risotto like rice, which was also pretty tasty although not very multidimensional.   I also ordered two drinks. One was a caipiranha made with strawberry and basil. I thought it was delicious but my fiancée thought it tasted too alcoholic. I think that is probably just because he does not like caipiranhas. also tried a pomegranate mojito that was also pretty good. I would recommend this restaurant since our server was very attentive, the food was delicious and reasonably priced, and it had a pleasant atmosphere.  Addendum: On a recent trip I had a lightly fried avocado stuffed with crab that was amazing!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips. Badly friend fish in bad oil. Could test burned oil. Even server admitted that it's possible because it is end of the day. Wow... did not give mr credit for bad food. Still charged me full price."}
{"text":"Im from New Orleans so I thought my Mom would love this for Mothers Day...WRONG!! The service was excruciatingly slow..was seated literally 20 mins before water arrived, antother 6 before 3 of the 5 drinks ordered came to the table. food took forever to come from the kitchen (and no, they werent too busy) and it was below average!! If youre looking for hometown food SKIP THIS PLACE AND HEAD TO LOLA'S!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, superb service, and from our all around wonderful server Rosa. Rosaline has made the experience for us at Landry's worth coming back to for the past 13 years."}
{"text":"Typically I sway towards visiting Red Lobster or Roys, but I decided to give Landrys a try. We went for a late lunch as a birthday dinner. The restaurant was busy, but not packed. The wait staff were extremely attentive and kept the garlic bread coming!  I went for the crawfish etouffee which had a flavorful sauce, the crawfish was not chewy or over cooked and the rice was perfect. Members of my party snagged red beans and rice with andouille and catfish which I nibbled. The catfish tasted light, flaky, and clean. The beans had an excellent paprika flavor. I also tasted my sisters grilled Cajun shrimp pasta, which at first glance, could be mistaken for bland pasta, but the very light garlic sauce really tied everything together unlike a messy Alfredo. They also brought a salad bowl to the table, so we really walked away stuffed!"}
{"text":"We went las night because we saw the 4 course special online.  The food was amazing and the check was only $20 each with the special.  The manager himself ca,e to our table twice to be sure the service was good, seems like lately you don't find that at restaurants.  We enjoyed our crab, appetizer, salads were delicious, and the dessert was obviously freshly made just for us.  You can't beat this Vegas for $20 AND they had drink specials, mojitos were yummy"}
{"text":"I went for happy hour and it was amazing! Brandon and Robert were amazing bartenders, super friendly and attentive. The Mai tai was delicious! The appetizers like the crab balls were great and filling! Def would come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Oysters on the half shell tonite were tops. Chilean sea bass was incredible. Blackened mahi mahi. Most beautiful woman to have dinner with. Excellent night."}
{"text":"That 1 star is probably 1/2 more than I'd like to give this joint. Well, it's not really a \"joint\" with the fancy white tablecloths  etc  low lights  dark atmosphere, but I swear...for the OVERPRICED meals all of us in my husband's birthday celebration party..we should have walked across the street to Palace Station , gambled & had burgers and fries...and would probably have $$ left!!  Service was OK...bro-in-law had crab legs that were so soft/overcooked he couldn't begin to crack them to get any meat out....I pointed to the \"crab cakes\" on the appetizer menu and was brough the \"crab cakes dinner...difference was I also got a 1/2 fist of rice & 2 grilled asparagus...for $27 vs the $14 I was thinking I was getting for just the crabcakes...not worth it...definetly not tasty  was the shrimp and grits...a definite no-no.The waiter was honest when the diner expressed distaste for the shrimp/grits and he says..\"well yeah...they're instant grits!\" Say what????  I could go on and on...but you get my drift. I will say at the least waiter was amenable to splitting the tab about 4 ways, but in my travels across country...I will stay far away from any Landry's seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"I have visited Landry's a total of 6 times, and each one of those times was for the Oyster Bar Trash. Blackened shrimp, sweet, lump crab meat,  perfectly cooked white rice, all under a lemon butter cream sauce.  This chain definitely has a problem with consistency. The Oyster Bar Trash is different every time (although you really can't go wrong).   Mistakes in the kitchen have occured, but the staff is accommodating, and we've never had a rude server. At this particular location, the kitchen did not provide the lemon butter sauce and the manager promptly got us what we needed.  I have had a bad experience with the gumbo as it was watery and flavorless. The lobster bisque lacked flavor as well. The pasta dishes are nice.  All in all, I have not ventured far into the menu as it was not an amazing experience, but the Oyster Bar Trash is a must eat. Service is great. The venue is clean and and has a nice ambience."}
{"text":"We went to dinner looking for good seafood. The service was excellent and the server, Rosa, her suggestions were superb. The food was delicious. The price for the snow crab seemed expensive when we ordered, but, when the meal arrived we were stunned at the size of the portion. The meal for four was pricey, but, worth it."}
{"text":"We were there for lunch and had both below average food and poor service. The waiter actually would like look away as he passed as if he were looking over other tables...there were only five tables occupied and he only had only a couple."}
{"text":"Went there for all you can eat king crab legs. For some reason, I was expecting red king crabs but of course they were the \"golden\" king crab. They were flavorless and over cooked. Ordered hush puppies and they were super dry and inedible. Very disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I nearly choked on the DRY steak.  Medium should never be so dry.  The service was ok, the atmosphere was nice but there seemed to be a big problem with my hostess and her boss.  (We'll leave it at that.)  I was uncomfortable listening to the squabble.  Price was way overpriced for what I got.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"My choice for a birthday dinner. Service was ok, but being on a specific food restricted diet, I had questions the server couldn't answer and didn't offer to go check with the kitchen on.  I ordered the grilled shrimp and a salad.  I asked for the weight of the shrimp but server didn't know.  She said there were 5 jumbo shrimp.  Nothing remotely jumbo about the shrimp and of various sizes.  More like 20-30 count shrimp you buy in the market. Husband had lobster scampi, such a small portion, we talked about going for a hamburger on the way home.  Even after dessert!  I don't recommend unless you're starting with appetizers and ending with dessert.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!! My fiance and I happened to see this place as we were driving around and it was one of the best impromptu lunch decisions! Our waiter John was so friendly and helpful, everything we ordered was delicious, and we enjoyed ourselves very much :)"}
{"text":"Yelp led us here for dinner and also gave us a tip that you can get All You Can Eat king crab legs on Tuesday nights - score!  Service was great and they just kept bringing they crab legs - we never had to ask.  It was a great crab meal for $50 - which is what you might spend on a pound of crab legs on the strip."}
{"text":"12/2/2011 at 5;00 pm  The service was extremely slow, and our waiter kept forgetting to bring items we ordered. there was 5 tables and us and it seemed like an eternity, the food was okay, not bad but not memorable. We could hear alot of commotion like an argument going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sea food restaurant off the Vegas strip, when we found the Landrys sea food . The ambience is great, the food is awesome and prices are reasonable. I have not seen any sea food places where the food is great, the quantity of food is right and the price is reasonable. It is a place that will be the top of my list when I visit LV next time, should be yours too."}
{"text":"On 8-11-13, despite some of the negative reviews that I read, my wife and I went to Landry's for dinner.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately met by the hostess, who promptly seated us, and that's where the good customer service ended.  I normally try to find something good to say about a restaurant when I right a review, but I HONESTLY say that Landry's was by far the WORST restaurant experience we've ever had!!!!!  Where to start: The server, who did not introduce himself, initially appeared to be a pleasant person, but as time went on, our initial perception was proven to be wrong.  He took our drink and appetizer order, and after a brief while he returned with our drinks.  While pouring my wife's drink, he spilled some of it on her; however, my wife didn't make a big deal out of it.  I specifically told him that I wanted a margarita on the rocks with salt around the rim of the glass.  He returned with a blended margarita with no salt.  Of course, I immediately sent it back.  Due to the fact that my wife's drink was horrible, she also sent hers back.  At this point, the negative attitude began to show.  Although he attempted to be cordial with me, it was obvious that he had an ATTITUDE with my wife.  We didn't feel appreciated at all.  Now, to make matters worse, if we had to rate the food, it would barely get a \"C.\"  The overall experience at Landry's was a \"D-.\"  The only reason we're not giving it an \"F\" is because we were seated promptly.  Quite frankly, we will never go back to this restaurant.  Overpriced, horrible service and sub-standard food.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so not impressed and either was my boyfriend. I got the fried seafood plater, 1st it didn't say it was fried but okay whatever. The only thing I really liked on the $ 21 plate was the stuffed shrimp and it only came with one. The mussels were okay, not the best. Boyfriend had the landrys special and he said the steak wasn't bad but it shouldn't have been so expensive. Overall I was left with a $ 60 bill and knew I could've got better quality service and food for way less at joes crab shack."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a small family reunion.  It was long wait time,and I had Fried Seafood Platter. The platter was cold ,and the bread the waiter served was hard as a rock.  One good thing I can say is I like big portion that they gave,just not cold. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Appalling. Awful. Terrible. I'll think of some more descriptors as I go along. This was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had.  We arrived at about 6:15pm to try Landry' s on a recommendation by a friend, so I didn't check the Yelp reviews before we went in. Big mistake.   There were only three other tables in the huge dining room that were occupied, and a large party in the back room that was pretty much done. Our server came over, and without a smile, asked what we wanted to drink. We checked out the menu, and the prices were fairly steep, so we thought it would be excellent. If I would've known that it was on par with a Red Lobster, we wouldn't have tried it.   Anyway, he came back to take our order and had the air of a superior waiter at a 5 star restaurant.  Everything on the menu seemed to be stuffed, fried, etc., and I didn't see anything that looked good. My husband got the fish and chips, and I got a bowl of clam chowder with a side salad. The salad was pretty good. Our server seemed a little offended that we didn't order $30 entrees, but took our order anyway.   The garlic bread that we got in lieu of an assorted bread basket was a cheap white roll with salty butter and garlic. My husband's fish was over breaded and was obviously frozen Sysco quality. I thought it tasted slightly rancid. Very substandard for almost $19. The fries were decent, but the onion straws were pasty. My clam chowder had a strange vinegary taste, and instead of serving traditional oyster crackers with it, it came with the cheapest saltines you can buy. I couldn't eat it and ended up sharing my husband's dinner.   Our waiter refilled our water, and took off. Not once did he check back with us to see how we liked our meal, even though he passed by us a half dozen times and wouldn't make eye contact. When he finally came over when we were done, he asked me if I didn't like the chowder. I said no, that it was just a personal preference, that one of the spices was overwhelming, and my husband agreed. I the said it kind of tasted vinegary to me, and he replied in a truly superior tone: \"I can assure you, there is no vinegar in the soup\". I was shocked speechless at his tone, and even my husband was surprised. He was then very chummy to my husband, saying \"hey, guy, you did a good job on those fish and chips\". No offer of dessert, coffee, or anything.   When he brought the check, he plopped it down in front of my husband and said \" enjoy\". VERY odd. I think he had pretensions of being a haute cuisine waiter on the Strip.  But here's the thing: he asked at the beginning if we were locals (which we are), and treated us as if we were McDonald's refugees. We always over tip for good service, because I used to be in the restaurant industry, but we didn't feel at all guilty in leaving him about 10%.   I'm not sure which part of our visit left the worse taste in my mouth, the bad food or the horrendous service. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town. Went there one night during the week it was unexpectedly closed wth."}
{"text":"Are here for the first time last night and I have to say it was pretty mediocre a at best. The service was terrible, I had to ask numerous times for refills and even a steak knife which took 10 minutes. The waiter handed numerous people including myself very hot plates that he has the luxury of holding with a towel, he also reached around and over us quite a few times rather than going out of his way. The waiter forgot to include our salads so when they were brought out each one was different almost as if they want back and emptied the fridge of all their salads. The food was pretty good, my steak was a little tougher than I expected but sometimes that happens. Overall I can't say they was a very good experience and the only reason a tip was left was because gratuity was already added to the bill."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were on the hunt for some Mai Tai's and we ended up going to Landry's.   Their Mai Tai's are amazing! Since drinks can be overpriced and small, I was happy to see a large glass in front of me, with gorgeous fruit and decorations on the outside.   After a couple more Mai Tai's, we were feeling loose, so we decided to try oysters! I was very cautious, because I don't like fish when it is overly fishy. We went with the Oysters Rockefeller - I must say.. I would die for them! They were amazing!  YUM YUM!  We also had their calamari which was very crispy, and the sauce was great as well.   The bartenders were friendly at the bar, and it was nice that we could go outside on the patio.  Highly would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for amazing oysters and drinks!"}
{"text":"This was the second time coming here and we liked it very much the first time. This time we brought three other people and ordered first the calamari. Even after my friend told the waitress that she could not tolerate anything spicy at all or peppered. the waitress never told us about the jalapenos in the calamari batter. It was so battered and so hot that it was inedible. Next was the fish and chips which we also had on our first visit. It too was over battered having little fish inside but also the fish tasted half cooked. We are Landry's Select Members and this visit really put a sour taste in our mouths. I am not sure that we will go again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this establishment the food was so delicious I had no room for dessert, I can honestly say I wish I did. Staff was very polite and helpful and always checking on us, I am very happy I brought my family here for my mom's birthday non of us were disappointed we each has different dish and every single one of our lunch items was perfection. Beutiful atmosphere and great location."}
{"text":"Seafood is a sketchy thing for me because I hate it but my husband loves it. I seldom make it at home for him so we have to go out. I was hoping Landry's would be that place we could go.  Nope.  I'll say it again. Nope.  Our waitress was awesome. I will give her that. Very attentive, friendly and slightly awkward in a cute way.   The appetizers we started off with were decent. I had the Onion Strings and Jalapeños and he had the Lobster Bisque and Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms. If you will remember, I hate seafood, but he was insistent I try the bisque. I agree, it was delicious. Buttery and creamy and smooth. The onions were lightly breaded and crispy. Done perfectly. The mushrooms are where it all started to go downhill.  The filling on them tasted old and weird. My husband had the Grilled Seafood platter as is entree and I had a steak. Again, everything on his platter tasted old and off. My steak was slightly over done, but liveable.  The horrifying end to this tale is that my husband was sick for a day after we ate there and me? I was sick for a good three days. And trust me, it was NOT the flu.  Never. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The dining area is really dark, which can make for a nice setting, but Landry's is so dark you almost can't read the menu.  The service was good, and the food was pretty good as well.  It wasn't crowded at all and we didn't have to wait too long for our food.  Would probably go back again."}
{"text":"Loved the stuffed flounder.  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  The place was almost empty at 2pm and the service was so bad that I did not leave a tip.  I ordered a diet coke that I never got and when we got the bill, I reminded the missing waiter for the ,it's part that I never received my diet coke.  He frown and made a grunting sound and walked out.  Never again will I go there."}
{"text":"After eating at Landry's in Orlando and figuring our poor experience there was just a coincidence I gave Landry's another shot and tested this Vegas location because anything this close to the strip can't be bad, right? Vegas is known for entertainment and food!   Wrong.  Landry's is overpriced, overrated and lacks and resemblance of real seafood. I tried the same meal at had at their Orlando location to see if this was better and nope - the same dry and bland taste. The fish tasted like it was just thawed and a salad, my fish and an ice tea ran me into the $30s.   At par with Red Lobster. No better."}
{"text":"I love the Clam Chowder. One day it seemed more chock-full of fresh wonderful clams than the other time. Be careful about eating Raw Oysters as they are from the Gulf but they taste good. I just have read about terrible bacteria from people who fish storing them at too warm temp which is NO FAULT of Landry's AT ALL. I love the Seafood Platter, mini stuffed crab was a nice touch. The Virgin Pina Coladas are awesome. The Birthday Special for Select Members is welcomed. The staff ambiance is good but there are sordid Vegas patron types everyplace. I don't mean to sound snobbish and I like it generally speaking but if you sit in the lounge to get faster service, be careful who you fraternize with, as it seems possibly creepy/dicey at times, lol."}
{"text":"Ok not bad at all! It is better than red lobster but not by much, but this has a cajun element to the menu that makes this place pretty good. I travel between Utah and California sometimes and hate trying to find something fun and good on the strip.  This is a Great place to stop and get some great seafood!"}
{"text":"Best oysters i have ever had! Sooo fresh and plump! I had broiled seafood platter... pretty good. I did not like the tilapia part of it, a bit too \"earthy\" for me... but the shrimp and rice was delish! Pretty quiet atmosphere but it may be a slow night... overall enjoyed it and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had a friend in town so we went to Landry's on a Sunday afternoon. There was a moderate crowd, but by no means busy. It was clear they were understaffed. We ordered an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. The breading on them was crumbling off and they weren't the best quality. The entrees were mediocre at best. I had the crab stuffed mahi. It came with a white sauce and asparagus, but the asparagus was very thick and woody. My friend ordered crab legs which were ok he said. They weren't on the lunch menu and quite pricey for the amount of them. It was almost impossible to get our check. We couldn't tell whether or not our server quit in the middle of his shift or was just pissed off and leaving early. Either way, it was poorly done. Don't get me wrong, the service was semi decent in the beginning but deteriorated quickly. I won't be returning to Landry, nor would I recommend the place to others. Spend your money somewhere else and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Friday before New Years, the wife was craving some seafood, and I've driven past this place quite a few times wondering if it was good.  It appears to have ample parking, but also seems to get a lot of customers walking across the street from the Palace Station.  I was looking for something light and tasty, and settled on the Avocado Lump Crab Salad for $18.99.  It filled up most of a good sixed plate, was nicely arranged, and most importantly, it was delicious.  Well, even more important than that, the stars of the salad, avocado and crab, were in every single bite.  The wife had Mahi Mahi for about $23.00.  Her plate had a large portion of broiled Mahi Mahi, fresh steamed broccoli, and some potatoes.  I ordered a baked potato ala carte for us to share, and it was stuffed for $3.99.  The staff was attentive, refilling drinks and making sure that we were content.  The wife assured me that the fish was fresh and tasty.  I wouldn't know for sure, because she wouldn't give up a bite.  Sometimes the place offers whole lobsters for $19.99, and the lobsters are alive and well in an aquarium at the entrance...fresh!"}
{"text":"We had been going here for several years annually when we would come to Vegas for school shopping and last vacation with the kids before school started.   Always excellent service and food. We had not been back for about 10 years as our kids got older we stopped making our annual trip. My husband and I just recently stopped in and we were able to visit a bit with the same wonderful waitress we had before and had an excellent dinner, King Crab legs. We also enjoyed happy hour. Atmosphere as always was great too. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Service: the service was good. Other than waiting a few for a hostess the service was good. Our waiter was attentative and polite.  Food: food was subpar. The oysters had shells on them which normally isn't a big deal but they were baked and covered with cheese so it was a nice suprise.  The salad was awesome. The highlight of the meal.  The tilapia Bianca was flavorless.  The grilled shrimp skewer with rice pilaf was flavorless as well.  Atmosphere: nice atmosphere. Good music. Nice seating. Clean dining area. Good decor for the theme. I enjoyed the dining experience overall.  Conclusion: come here for a few drinks and some dessert. This place should not be a main course visit but more a drinks with friends as a night cap or a pre night out stop."}
{"text":"We came here for a business lunch. The restaurant was completely empty so we had our choice of seating and opted for a booth. Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink order. They have a happy hour special 3-7pm daily for those looking to imbibe and enjoy small bites. We ordered off the regular lunch menu. I had their lobster bisque which was very underwhelming. I will always and forever love Brio's lobster bisque. As my entree I had FRESH CATCH PONTCHARTRAIN - broiled tilapia fillets, lump blue crab, mushroom ragoût, white wine cream sauce; rice pilaf & broccoli crown. I thought it was very well prepared and delicious, especially for it being tilapia. I also sampled some of their fish and chips and Shrimp Jambalaya and decided that my option was by far the tastiest. Unless a client insists on lunch or dinner here, I would not come back. It is not cheap and the food quality and taste do not warrant the price."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with some friends and honestly was a bit let down.    We had arrived for an early lunch.  The service here is ok.  Nothing too spectacular or memorable. Since I'm always hungry, we wanted to start with the crab, spinach and artichoke dip. It was very dry and also topped with way too much pico de gallo. Bummed.  I was surprised to learn they bring out a huge salad and bread for the table.  We were all unaware of this or we wouldn't have ordered the app.  The salad and bread were good.  I can't complain about that.   I love seafood and could possibly eat it everyday.  But the entree of shrimp and grits is disappointing.  There were plenty of shrimp but the grits were way overdone.  The sauce surrounding it was too much sauce with very little veggies in it.  I don't know if that is on purpose but it wasn't a winner.    I probably won't be rushing back here.  There are plenty of other great seafood restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"While my best friend was in town from Orlando visiting he wanted to get some good seafood off the Strip.  After checking Yelp we found Landry's and decided to give it a try.  The Yelp reviews are hit or miss for this place but thankfully our experience was a hit.  Landry's is located across from the Palace Station on Sahara.  Since it was a quiet Monday there were not many diners here.  We were promptly seated and our drink order taken.    I opted for the ruby Cosmo and was very happy with my choice.  It's always disappointing when you get a martini and it's only three quarters of the way full.  This one was filled to the top and full of flavor...perfect.  Dinner comes with soft bread and a salad bowl for the table to share.  Our server prepared the salad at our table and mixed in their house made dressing (a balsamic with a lemon flavor.  It was good).    For our main entrees we ordered the crab stuffed mahi and crab cakes.  The crab stuffed mahi had a light cream sauce on top and featured crab orzo and grilled asparagus.  It was light but full of flavor and delicious.  My friend raved about his crab cakes and said they didn't skimp on the chunks of crab.    For dessert my friend wanted chocolate so the double chocolate cake was a must.  It had layers of chocolate ganache and chocolate frosting.  Definitely a huge piece of cake and beautifully presented on the plate.  He wasn't in the mood to share (some friend he is!) so I ordered the mini sampler for myself.  The mini sampler comes with a brownie sundae, bread pudding à la mode with foster and vanilla sauce, and crème brûlée.    Everything tasted great and the service was fantastic.  Dinner isn't cheap at Landry's but for the quality and taste it is worth the price.  Sure there are more pretentious, expensive seafood places in Vegas but Landry's hit the mark for me and I will be back.  Total bill for 2 dinners, 1 cocktail, 2 desserts and 20% tip was about $120."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  If I could give them a negative rating, I would.  I was visiting Las Vegas with friends and family.  We were a large group -- 18 of us -- which they accommodated.  We arrived on time for our 7:30 reservation and they surprisingly sat us, even though not all of our party had arrived.  It all went downhill from there.  The food was just -- meh.  Ok.  I ordered the Snapper Hemingway, which I didn't even finish.  The food was just ok.  Nothing overwhelming, more underwhelming.  And then the horror began.  Our waiter -- whose name I did not get -- was clearly flustered, frustrated and annoyed almost from the moment we sat down.  While the appetizers arrived fairly quickly, the dinner took awhile.  But, you give people the benefit of the doubt -- we were a large party at 18.  But the restaurant was less than half full -- a couple of patrons at maybe five other tables.  10-15 people tops.  But hold on, the best is yet to come.  The big stinking mess started with the bill.  I will start off by saying that it took over an hour for our server to get us the bill.  I am not exaggerating-- over an hour!  Granted, the bills were separated by groups of 2, 3 and 4 but this was at his request, not ours.  With such a large party I assumed all the food would be on just the one bill but it was our server who said he could separate it in groups.  After a 40 minute wait, he finally arrived with the bills in hand, only to discover that he had put other folks items on other folks bills.  Then it took another 40 minutes for him to re-figure everything.  All.Over.Again.  At no point did the manager come over to apologize, comp us a drink, dessert, nothing.  My twin was so enraged she got up and had to go find the manager who had to be found like the Lost Ark of the Covenant.  Where she was God only knows while this now incredibly angry server is trying to refigure the bills.  I'm not looking for a comp'd drink or a comp'd anything but for crying out loud, go help the guy!    And there she stood, with my twin towering over her, with a completely detached demeanor, defending the server.  She was nearly comatose.  I couldn't help but wonder if she was on some kind of medication.  Here's a tip for Landry's Seafood Las Vegas -- how about hiring staff who actually care?  And having an actual pulse might come in handy.  I was SO ready to leave the man a $2 tip but thought of Anthony Bourdain, the chef and host of CNN's Parts Unknown, who always, ALWAYS leaves 18% REGARDLESS of the service, and I plunked down my 18%.   Landry's Seafood Las Vegas made a crap load of money off of us last Friday evening (March 14).  It's too bad I wasn't at the roulette tables.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  RUN QUICKLY THE OTHER WAY."}
{"text":"The food and service are good, but the overall experience lacks the fine dining feel and a balance of value.   We had been interested in trying Landry's for some time. When we finally got in, we were quite excited. We were promptly greeted and show to our table. The dining room is REALLY dark. Our server was very nice. A little too casual, but he was doing okay. He knew the menu and the options, so I can say he was on his game as far as server professionalism.   I had the Surf & Turf, which was good, but not great. The side of asparagus was over cooked and tasted like something gourmet that you tried to cook at home, but didn't get quite right the first time.   I hate to be too down on the place, but it felt more \"cute\" than welcoming.  About a week later, we had the same meal at a chain joint and it was twice the quality for 1/3 of the price. We spent the ride home comparing fine dining and casual experiences... it was interesting how we got there.  Landry's feels like a once great restaurant that has stopped investing in linens, silverware, and the accouterments of fine dining presentation.   I want to try it again in a year or so to see if I can update this review."}
{"text":"We great experience at Landry's Seafood Restraurant. The service here is superb. Some of the best seafood I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Been to Landry's twice and both times were a great experience. I always go during Happy Hour and the deals are amazing. Not to mention the drinks are as well. The buffalo sliders and the bacon wrapped shrimp are a must try."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for the first time as I had heard about their Happy Hour and wanted to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. I was most impressed with the friendly and comfortable atmosphere and service of the all of the bartenders. The portion sizes for the price is awesome..huge portions. The drinks were very reasonable and delish as well. I had the fried zucchini and the buffalo chicken sliders (don't ask me why I ordered chicken at a seafood restaurant..lol). The reason only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was due to the sliders as they were a bit dry. Nevertheless overall for appetizers and several drinks for under $25 you can't beat it. Next time though I am trying a couple of other items like the stuffed shrimp enbrochette and the firecracker shrimp poppers.::-)"}
{"text":"I was very surprised that Landry's Seafood gets negative reviews because my wife and I have always had a great experience at this restaurant.  We visit about once a month and have found it to be consistently clean with friendly, attentive staff and great food.  I've never had a bad experience here and I always leave feeling full, satisfied and that I had a great meal!  Thus the 5 star rating.    My wife and I usually eat at the bar area just because we like things more casual and we like the more social staff that they obviously staff there.  The drinks are great and happy hour is second to none!  We make a special trip often just to take advantage of it.  We also like that it has a rewards card where we can rack up points and use them all over the Valley.  If you haven't ever been to this restaurant, I sincerely recommend it and know it is worth a visit.  It may not be your cup of tea, but for someone who lives in Sin City where some of the greatest restaurants in the world are, it is a solid restaurant.  It isn't super high end or anything, but it does what it was meant to do - provides great seafood at a fair price with great service.  I really don't know what more you would want."}
{"text":"Mediocre. They gave us no spoons, took way too long to bring the viddles, I received a tiny cup of tartar sauce for my fish, and the prices were too high. Not so clean either, but I'm glad my boyfriend took me here, because now I know I don't want to go back :P"}
{"text":"I order the lunchbox special and got the fried zucchini and crawfish meal. Both were delicious. I do recommend both dishes."}
{"text":"Seafood house...hmmmm? A seafood chain at that. Well, well, well to my surprise the food was really good. The 3 stars is no reflection of the food, it is for the slow service. Although the server was polite, he seemed a bit nervous and he was slow, and the restaurant was not crowded at all.   I ordered the seafood gumbo to start, which is something I rarely order out because I grew up on gumbo and it is not often you get that homemade taste at a restaurant. Now, I'm not saying it tasted like Mama's, but it was very flavorful and was filled with lots of seafood. I also had the oyster po boy. It was huge, thus making it really difficult to eat, but the oysters were seasoned well atop lettuce and tomatoes with a spicy remoulade sauce. I will definitely stop the next time I see a Landry's (none in California)."}
{"text":"I came here with my hubby, 2 boys (ages 5 and 6), and a friend. We sat down, and the menu was so amazing, we didn't even know where to start. We are not from Las Vegas, so we wanted to eat somewhere nice.   The atmosphere is very welcoming, and laid back even though it has a fancy factor. We were dressed very casual, but there were also people there who were dressed up in suits as well. It was not busy at all, even though it was prime time for dinner. The restaurant itself is very clean, and the menu items are reasonably priced for the portion sizes. You could definitely share, and we ended up ordering way too much food.   What we ended up ordering:   Crab and Spinach Artichoke Dip: It tasted very much like the ocean? It was a little salty. It didn't taste really special? I was kind of actually disappointed. If I were to compare it to something, it would probably be tuna salad... nothing special here.   Fish and Chips. They serve a lot of their dishes with fried onion curls that my kids actually really enjoyed. This dish however was nothing special, but it's Fish and Chips, so I didn't expect anything fancy anyways. Kids liked it... it was salty for the adults...   Crispy Fish Sandwich. My friend liked it overall, but again, it was really salty... Enough to share though!   Shrimp Jambalaya. They use Jumbo shrimp, so it is really satisfying, and it was spicy (yum) but in comparison to Bubba Gump's Shrimp Jambalaya, it is not as good. The consistency is more soupy, and the sausage was missing?   Fried Seafood Platter. I ordered this, and it came with an assortment of fried seafood. 1. Fried oysters: I LOVE fried oysters, and this was sooo good, but overly SALTY... i picked the batter off and just ate the oysters. 2. Stuffed Blue Shell Crab: I was not impressed that it was stuffed with some sort of bread and they used cold water shrimp... I would have rather them use less medium size shrimp, but this was also really salty for me. 3. There were an assortment of shrimp, and it was served with fried onions and fries. The shrimp didn't make me go wow... it was just battered shrimp. One was stuffed, and the others were just battered and deep fried.    All the dishes came with a house salad with your choice of dressing and complimentary garlic bread. Their garlic bread was good, but not I want seconds good.   House Balsamic Dressing: interesting and unique taste... Not sure what kind of balsamic vinegar they use, but it definitely is not what I am use to being served. I liked it though.  They serve your food in courses. The appetizer came out first. The Salads came out second, and then your meal. I feel like they are going for the fine dining experience. The waiter was friendly, but did not refill my hot water for me. However, he did refill everyone else's iced water.   They also offer a 10% Military Discount, but we did not get this since we asked after our card was ran.   It was also my birthday, and they gave me a tiny Creme Brulee that you could probably finish in one bite. I guess I must be spoiled, cause RA gave me a giant deep fried tempura ice cream served with raspberry and chocolate sauce hahaha!   Overall... I would not recommend this place to a friend, and I don't think we will be going back... I cannot speak for their other dishes. Maybe we just didn't pick the right ones? I sadly think as much as we did order, not one of those items blew my mind..."}
{"text":"Exasperated by the long wait at Oyster Bar, my boyfriend and I decided to check out Landry's. It was about 7:30pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. The restaurant was about 3/4 full. Our server was nice and welcoming. The ambiance was great for a date night.   The oyster bar trash is a great small plate but I'm warning that it is indeed a small portion. We are talking about a small pile of crabmeat and 5 shrimps with a small scoop of rice! However, the lump blue crab and blackened shrimp tasted fresh and delicious. Both went well with the lemon beurre blanc that accompanied the dish. The broccoli side dish was stir-fried with a lot of good flavors going on. It could make any defiant kid eat broccoli! The clam chowder was chunky, fresh and satisfying! The complimentary garlic bread went great with the clam chowder.   My only gripe was that my Coronita came out after my food. The server didn't exactly update me on my drink either. I had to follow up with her and she said that the new bartender didn't understand the order. She assured that my drink will soon be on its way. She was genuine though so it wasn't a huge deal.   I don't know if I'd return with so many dining options in Vegas. This restaurant is actually off the strip too. Perhaps if I wanted to try Oyster Bar but gave up again, or if I wanted a quiet dining experience away from the strip, I'd consider coming back here. Overall, a solid dining experience and it definitely rescued me from my hunger and exhaustion from waiting in the line at Oyster Bar!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 stars. Definitely has its pros and cons. We came in Saturday night around 8:30 for dinner. Sat in the bar for happy hour, which goes until 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays. We ordered the shrimp embrauchette and some cocktails, as well as a full meal each.   The embrouchette was wonderful. Seafood-stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon with onion strings. $7 on happy hour. Definitely the highlight of the meal. I ordered the seafood pasta, which was pretty disappointing. My mussels were very overcooked and it was just underwhelming for $20. My friends fish and chips were decent though.  Service was 3 stars too. One lady by herself in the bar area and she seemed very nonchalant about everything. I think she was just ready to go home.   I don't know if I'd come back here next time in Vegas. I have a high standard for seafood restaurants like these and Landry's just doesn't really measure up."}
{"text":"They have all you can eat Alaskan snow crab on Tuesday and Thursday.  Its served all day.  the crab meat taste good but the shell was difficult to crack due to it seemed as if it was sitting in water and the shell become super soft.  The house salad is good with there dressing"}
{"text":"Good food overall. Service was excellent. Nice atmosphere. 3 steaks ordered at my table. They all were happy with their meals. I had a mahi mahi entree and it was decent. Customer Service is so important to me, they won me over!"}
{"text":"Sadly I chose this restaurant in February for my dads birthday brunch (somehow this review has evaded being posted by hiding in my drafts). They were clearly understaffed in the front of the house and our poor server was trying her best but there's only so much one woman can do. I don't fault her for lack of staffing at all. The food however was horrible. My husband and I had dishes that tasted very similar. Bacon wrapped shrimp and stuffed shrimp. Ewwww. Most likely it was precooked loooong before it was served because both were extremely mooshy. No texture at all. My dad liked his crawfish etouffee but hes a 71 year old smoker...he likes everything! Haha We all liked the stuffed mushrooms and our calamari was average at best. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"From walking into the door, being seated and greeted by the staff makes you feel at home. Everyone is so helpful. You can tell they are a real team and not there to make a quick dollar. The bartenders know exactly what their doing, busers get it done quick so that table is ready for the next guest. The kitchen staff is phenomenal at what they do. landrys is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Decided to do an early Valentines dinner with my wife to avoid the crowd. We pass Landry almost every day for the last 10 years we've lived here in Vegas so decided to give it a try. Between breakfast and dinner we eat out at least 5 times a week. What a TOTAL disappointing adventure. We started with happy hour drinks which were ok but then it jus went downhill quickly. We ordered two appetizers, zucchini and calamari. Zucchini was ok but calamari sucked and this was a seafood restaurant!! Next we shared a seafood platter which came with a so so bread and so so salad. On the platter was a seafood stuffed crab shell which was almost all breading, shrimp in a bad sauce, some kind of fish on the bottom of the plate and a portion of VERY bland white rice.  My drink was never refilled and waitress sort of disappeared. Manager came by to ask how everything was and we told her as she could see by leftover food on our plates. She did take six dollars off of a $49 bill. After watching the success of Tillman Fertittas Show, billionaire buyer, we were very unhappy and will not be going back which is a shame because we like to support local businesses. When we got home I saw I had left my wallet at restaurant. Busboy found it and gave it to manager who said it was in safe waiting for me to pick it up. Must say when I got back to restaurant all seemed to be in order. I of coursed asked for person who turned it in and tipped him. I applaud their honesty"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour every day with lots of deep discounts. You can drink and eat for very cheap in the bar and there are plenty of choices and full size as well."}
{"text":"$70 bucks for poor service, watered down pasta, and a free loaf of garlic bread you have to search for on the menu.......inquire about with the waiter........and then constantly remind because they accidentally forget over and over again........me thinks not. Also I'd like to peg them for false advertising their sign outside says ask us about our $20 four course meal and then you get inside and you realize that 2 our of the 4 courses was a glass of water and the mint at the end. Too high priced for me.  *UPDATE*  Tried to go here for a conference and was so off put by how they treated our group that we forfeited a catered meal and took our business elsewhere.   STRIKE 2"}
{"text":"Worse than red lobster. Not kidding. Food came out soggy and disgusting. Probably frozen seafood and not fresh. Embarrassed that I took my parents here when they were visiting from Asia and they were craving some American style seafood. Ughhhhhhh!"}
{"text":"Emeril has nothing to worry about.  I've never tasted burnt water before, but now I have.  Too bad my husband ordered it thinking he was getting seafood gumbo.  But wait!  There's More!  Ever had etouffe?  Not like this you haven't.  Imagine Campbell's Tomato Soup (with added cornstarch) poured over poor unsuspecting shrimp.  Yes, shrimp, even though I had ordered Crawfish toffe.  The shrimp tails were no clue to the waitress that she had the order wrong.  I don't even want to go into the sad excuse for a salad with Too Much Mustard, Too Much Basalmic Dressing.  Those of you who visit Las Vegas will probably not run into this off the Strip restaurant and now all Yelpers can avoid it, too."}
{"text":"After dining here for 13 years it's still our favourite resturant why the food and the service provided by Rosa she still continues to impress us. Her as our server is so important we won't visit if she is off. The food is always awesome"}
{"text":"Landry's is a seafood restaurant that's off the strip, on Sahara, across the the Palace Station.  Lots of parking and immediate seating. The dining area never got too busy but then again, it was Black Friday and most everyone was probably out shopping or stuck in the parking lot gridlock of the malls or shopping centers.   Service was great. Our server was attentive, friendly and patient.  For appetizers, I had 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell. A little on the small side but they were nicely chilled and shucked which is always a plus. I also got an order of their shrimp cocktail. It was ok.  I ordered the deep fried seafood platter. The dish was a little over done but not to the point that everything was dried out. The dish comes with onion rings - just too many. I would have rather have had more fries as these rings were like straw rings.   I did order their signature dessert - Bananas Foster. Huge serving. More than enough for a few people or small family. It was the highlight of my meal.   The rest was ok."}
{"text":"I came here to have a b'day dinner and I must say the whole experience was great. Great host, server, and food. This place reminds me of Pappadeaux. We were very pleased."}
{"text":"Actually made a trip out this way from the strip in hopes to hit the Oyster Bar at Palace Station. Upon arrival there and seeing a line 20 deep, rather than wisely going back to the strip, we walked here for dinner on recommendation of our Uber driver.   Will first give positives....nice quiet ambiance. Our waitress (forget her name) was pleasant and professional and did a fine job.   I started with a bowl of lobster bisque and it was good. Loaf of bread seemed generic and the 'famous' salad was underwhelming. Not sure who deemed it famous, but nothing stood out.   On to the entrees...Mrs got crusted tilapia Bianca. It was a lot of breading---looked like something you get at a fast food joint. It was smothered in a sauce and topped with a few pieces of shrimp (tail still on). Had marginal flavor at best. Not close to worth the $25 or so.   I decided on the crab stuffed mahi having read descriptions of blue crab and reviews of wonderful crab cakes. Ugh.   This is not real crab. As a native of Baltimore it's laughable. Horrible crab. Just not good. Not lump. Crab cakes have a little mayo, slight filler and some old bay like seasoning. This had none of that.  Then the poor Mahi has tough and dry- almost as inedible as the crab.   Thankfully the waitress saw my displeasure and took my entree off the bill. That was a good move. I give 2 stars for the bisque and the service. With all the other amazing options in Vegas, go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Incredible dinner there tonight with incredible service from Rosa!  She made me feel like family - it doesn't get any better than that!!!!     Lucy and I thank you Rosa!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I came here was for the all you can eat crab. I used to go to Hush Puppies further west on Charleston which charged $26 for all you can eat snow crab, and oh it was lovely.  Soon after Hush Puppies stopped there all you can eat (they blamed it on the Japan Tsunami..yea right!) we were in search of another all you can eat spot. excluding buffets (which offer them cold) this was quite a challenge.  And in comes Landry's advertising their all you can eat Tuesday special. Quite pricey IMO at $55 a long cry from what Hush Puppies used to charge. It came with a quaint salad which wasn't bad and a side of mash potatoes which I put to the side, I WANT THE CRAB DAMMIT!  The first round was really good. The meat slid right out of the shell, sweet and thick. With lemon and hot butter it was delish. But wait in came the second and third round and I experienced something I have never seen before. A 2nd molted skin type layer after the shell. It was quite annoying (I posted a picture of this phenomenon) I eat the first few with this vicious layer, not to good on the pallet and fumbled for awhile trying to peel it off the rest of the crab. NOT FUN!  Service was good, sat at a booth by the bar. Server/Bartender was very friendly however seemed annoyed at another all you can eat customer due to his multi-tasking abilities I'd imagine. Each round came without asking, never really had to wait.   I know king crab is supposed to be better than snow crab however with this 2nd layer molted shell I much rather have the snow crab, and at $55 I have to honestly say its not worth it. The ambience was nice along with the decor but they have a long way to go as far as crab quality, its was subpar to say the least. Wont be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"From 5/28/15 We have passed Landry's Seafood a bunch of times, so today we decided to give them a try. Landry's Seafood is located on West Sahara Ave and is part of a plaza with shops, a bakery and David's Bridal. Once you come into the restaurant, you really get an idea of how big this place is, and it has a good set up for seating.   We were seated, ordered our food, and it came out promptly. I ordered the Tilapia Hemingway from \"Chef Trilogy,\" which is Parmesan crusted with blue crab on top, this also comes with salad, rice pilaf, asparagus, and includes dessert- I got the Crème Brulee. The fish was cooked well, and tasty I feel like they gave a fair amount of blue for the price, the asparagus had no flavor, but the rice pilaf was good. The Crème Brulee was excellent, I could have gone for seconds and been a total glutton.   Our server was awesome, can't remember his name but he was great and attentive. I'll definitely return to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for seafood, and Landrys was near work so I thought I'd give it a try. Overall, a very mediocre experience that I won't be repeating.  My server, while friendly enough, seemed quite disorganized. Instead of my salad, appetizer and bread all arriving together, there was at least a 10 minute interval between each. I got the impression  that because I was dining alone, I was an afterthought at best.  I got the 3-course meal for $20. The fried calamari appetizer was completely tasteless. For an entree, I got the shrimp trio (shrimp linguini, fried shrimp and shrimp rice pilaf). The shrimp were way overcooked and the entire meal  lacked any real flavor. I could just as easily have gotten the same quality of food at Long John Silvers for a fraction of the price. This is just another corporate chain and they have the crappy food to prove it. For the $30 I spent, I could have had a lovely meal at my favorite sushi joint."}
{"text":"3-Stars solely on the food. Service was slacking! Not just one time but on the multiple occasions I've been here. If it weren't for the Lobster Bisque (Best I've had!), I'd probably give it a 2-Stars.  My Favorites: Lobster Bisque - Soo delicious!  Rich, Creamy & Bursting with flavors! Crab Cakes - Can we say Yum?!"}
{"text":"Don't come here, they are thieves. I accidentally left my $60 here after paying my bill, I come back ten minutes later and the manager said no one returned it. The table had no one there and it was cleaned, so the only person who was there was the waitress and busser.  They stole from a single mom. Petty."}
{"text":"We were seated almost immediately, but had to wait nearly 10 minutes before we got our drink. The potatoes, salad and bread were really good. We ordered the Tuesday night all you can eat King Crab legs. For the price they charge, we expected properly cooked, high quality crab. All the crab legs were picture perfect. But, they were so overcooked, they were nearly impossible to eat. The meat inside was dry, crumbley, tasteless; completely worthless. The shells were soft and rubbery. A lot of the meat was brown from being overcooked. After the first round of bad crab legs, we were hoping for much better in the second round. What we got was dryer, completely tasteless crab legs. After complaining to the manager, she took one of the meals off the ticket, by my request. All things considered, I will never eat here again. There's far too many good all you can eat crab leg buffets in this city to even consider going back."}
{"text":"Overall, OK.   DON'T order the mango signature crap drink they try to push.  Straight sugar, hardly a splash of alcohol.  I never send anything back.  Ever.  I had to break my rule this time...that damn drink would give anybody diabetes.  Complaining aside, the food wasn't bad...in fact, better than I expected.  (of course, the original plan was to hit up the oyster bar across the street at Palace Station....this was an unwanted substitute).  So, expectations being low, this place pleasantly surprised me.  More than anything, the quality of service from our waitress impressed.  Some of the best I've had in a while.  Genuinely friendly, and fast.    Not the  worst place you could eat...."}
{"text":"I love coming here during lunch and getting their crawfish etouffee. It has so many spices, so much crawfish. The portion is generous enough to keep you satisfied. The only issue is the price. Everything seems pretty expensive (even for seafood)."}
{"text":"The food was ok at best the waiter sucked for being the same owners as Vic and Anthony  steakhouse the two don't compare to each other this place reminds me of a over priced joes crab  shack with bad service"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town for some serious eating and we found a Oyster Bar in one of the local casino's (name escapes me at the moment).   We get there and see that the line is long, so we walk out and see Landry's across the street with, of course, \"OYSTERS\" written on the wall. So we thought, why not? It couldn't possibly be any busier than the small Oyster bar we attempted try.  The fist thing I noticed walking in, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I would say out of 20 tables, only 2 were occupied. That was a bad sign, but I didn't let it get to me.  We are seated and our orders are taken. Our drinks are promptly served, and our appetizers don't come out too much later.  I had a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. It was one of the best Lobster Bisque's I've ever had. It was nicely creamy, with the hint of the lobster, and just enough \"umph\" from the spices. So, great job on that Landry's.  That's where the happy ending comes to, well, an ending. We start the waiting game for our other dishes / main courses. One by one, they start to show up, but mind you, at least 20 mins between EACH dish passes before the next one gets delivered. By the end of about an hour and a half (after we did speak to our waitress, about what was taking so long - at which her only reply was, I don't know.   Needless to say, the food (when we did get it) was decent, but the service destroys the entire experience. Of course by the duration of waiting for our dishes and actually getting them, the place did finally have more patrons.   It was weird though, even though they showed up after us, a lot of them seemed to be served before us.   Maybe next time, I'll just call for pickup?"}
{"text":"after the CES . We came to eat. Ordered appetizer. Firecracker shrimp and omg let me just say it was to die for .  Also the captains punch. Yummy yummy drink.  My sister ordered the fish and chips and let's just say lots of food. Better come with big appetite.  I ordered the rib eye with bake potato and man I'm so full but don't want to waste it."}
{"text":"I went here last week I really like the food there , very good oisters  I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Landrys for the first time together during happy hour. First, we had to ask if we could be assisted while other patrons were being served around us (even a party that arrived after we had) after waiting the waitress took our order, brought our drinks shortly after. After waiting 30 min for our food we asked if she could check on our order (which was just appetizers) 10 min later our food came out which we had to scarf down since we were almost late for our show due to the lack of service. Half of our order was cold and half was hot. Due to the inconsistencies with service we will not be back! The hostess was the only person that really acknowledged us."}
{"text":"Relaxing, romantic atmosphere. Of course it reminded me of the restaurants in Louisiana so I felt cozy and at home. I usually don't prefer to be seated in the center of a restaurant but I like the layout here. The chairs were also comfortable. Waiter was pleasant and friendly. Didn't hover and was giving us compliments when he did stop to chat with us. French garlic bread to start. Went well with my bowl of lobster bisque. Paired the bisque with a glass of KJ and it was a fabulous treat, imo. Very filling. Hubby ordered fish topped with white wine sauce and mushrooms, seasoned rice (not sure if it was pilaf) and seasoned broccoli. All very fresh and satisfying. Oh and his house salad with ranch before the entree was good to nibble on with the buttery bread. His crown and coke was good as well. We opted out for dessert since we were content with our fulfilling meal. Overall nice experience."}
{"text":"This was the location of our Valentine's Dinner and since I've never heard of this place we decided to dine here.. I had the delicious Mai Mai and my BF had a steak. The service was great, it could had been a more romantic setting, I might just be venting since there was a couple who brought their twins who where crying thru the entire meal. There was also a wedding in the hall but that didn't take away any focus of our service."}
{"text":"This review is based on one lunch service. I typically wait until more than one experience before writing a review, but honestly I am pretty convinced I won't be back. Unless it's an invite where the other party insists, because I won't be spending my $$ here.  The reason there are 3 stars instead of 2, SERVICE. I can not blame the friendly hostess nor the attentive server for the lack in flavor. So by all means, credit is due in the hospitality department.  I was in during a busy work week lunch hour. I was very happy to be seated at a booth instead of a table, even though I was dining alone.  I ordered the fish tacos with dirty rice instead of fries. (small upcharge) I also started with a cup of clam chowder. The soup was decent. FULL of clams, like almost overwhelming. However it would have really hit the spot had the consistency been a bit thicker.  Still ate it all, so I approve.  Now the tacos, probably the worst fish tacos I have ever had. Not what I expect from a place known as the \"seafood house\" Double tortillas as usual, but they were soggy. Like soggy and stuck together from either sitting under a heat lamp or even being re-heated. Same thing with the fish inside. You could tell at one point in time, it was a crispy filet. Now it was just moist and not appetizing at all. But where was the moisture coming from? I didn't seem to have this sauce that I read about in other reviews. Just cabbage, and a very very small side of avocado. I ate the avocado alone, it tasted better that way. I tried to eat only the fish out of the taco, but I couldn't do it. Flat out gross.  To top it off, the dirty rice was at least 2-3 days old. Mushy like it had been in a rice cooker overnight. The flavor would have been ok had it been fresh. I could have put all the rice in a big ball and it would have stuck together easily. The 16 year old me would have thrown it back in the kitchen, but it just sadly sat on the plate. Untouched.  Last time I waste a dub on a nasty, sit down, not fresh, seafood lunch, that is FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"I honestly cannot tell you what the regular menu looks like because I'm always here for happy hour! Who can resist costs of $4, $5, $6??! Happy Hour starts from 3-7pm daily at the bar. The later you come the harder it is to find a seat since it's only about 5 booths and a regular sized bar. They really should take some of the dinning room and turn it into a happy hour area!   The pomegranate martini is one of my favs. The spinach artichoke dip, crab balls and calamari are usually always ordered when I'm with a group of friends..and when my friends and I can spend less than 50 bucks as a group for food and drinks..we're usually pretty happy!  The bartenders and servers are pretty pleasant as well. All in all, a good happy hour spot."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they are getting 2 stars instead of one is because of their manager.  I really wanted seafood and didn't want to deal with the strip so I decided to check Landry's out.  I loved the one in New Orelans so I figured it couldn't be that bad...right?  Boy was I wrong!  I ordered some dish that was billed as \"parmesan crusted shrimp\" with lump crab meat on top.  The shrimp was basically frozen, fried shrimp and the lump crab meat tasted like that crappy meat you get from the bottom of the cluster....slightly fishy.  The boyfriend got a burger, cause he doesn't like seafood and wasn't a fan either.  We checked in on yelp and got the free stuffed jalapeno appetizer.  This was the ONLY thing that tasted good.  I'm allergic to dairy and asked the waitress if they had cream cheese in them and she said no.  After eating one, I could feel my throat start to close up and asked a manager who was walking by.  He told me that there WAS cream cheese and then asked if I was allergic, to which I told him I was.  He apologized profusely and said that the waitress should have known better, as she has worked there for quite some time.  She ended up coming over and apologizing and they comped the entire meal and gave us a free card for an appetizer/dessert on the next visit.  Unfortunately, I will not be returning to this location.  The food was a huge disappointment, especially for the price."}
{"text":"The food could have been a lot better. Gumbo was too pasty.I wouldnt call it gumbo. I kept waiting for it to get better but it was going downhill with every bite.I ordered the Melisa seafood topping as a side ddish and it started out great. Got to the bottom and it was salty. Dont know how that happened. The saving grace was that my server was awesome!!!."}
{"text":"Our server, Jose, was so nice and very accommodating to us. We had never eaten at Landrys before, but after the great grub an device from Jose an Tony, we will surely become regulars. Thank you guys so much for the great food and a great experience. :)"}
{"text":"Staff was amazing, friendly, informative, attentive. Great happy hour deals and food was awesome too! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, so we know what is scrumptious to us. I love this place. Soft light, not always packed to the brim. The atmosphere is calm & welcoming... Ok, time to eat!"}
{"text":"The food here is great as I expected, but that alone would have likely garnered just a 3-4 star rating. What really set it over the top was the service of an amazing seever named Jason. I've lived in Vegas for a few years now, and he is the best server I've encountered in town."}
{"text":"I've had better meals at  Red Lobster. Lets start with the garlic bread. It wasn't that great and our first batch was cold. The service was super slow it took 45 minutes to get our main dish.  I ordered the lobster tail with the baked potato. I should have substituted the backed potato with fries or asparagus it was terrible! My boyfriend ordered the lobster which was over cooked and tough. We ordered another batch of garlic bread which was better.  Took forever to get a refill on drinks and there weren't that many people there.   Plus: Easy to get to, No wait, parking was easy and our server was nice.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Had dinner here before a show in Vegas downtown.  Made a reservation and was seated right away.  My husband ordered this onion app, which may be the biggest app I have seen in my life.  Between me picking at it and him eating it, we ate maybe half.  I ended up cancelling my soup order because I was getting so full.  Service was efficient, but kinda slow.  Also, the place was not very busy, and they chose to sit us (a couple) between two tables that contained little kids.  So, most of our meal, we dealt with table one's kid running around the entire place and table two singing the ABCs and clapping.  Common sense would say, hey, sit the couple someplace more quiet. Common sense would also dictate that these couples not bring screaming kids to an upscale place, but what can you do.  But, whatever.  My meal was super good and I would go here again and recommend."}
{"text":"Well we walked in the hostess was very pleasant seated us and wished my husband Happy Birthday 4vtimes how nice, our favorite waitress  , Rosa was their to greet us.   We haven't seen her in quite awhile, still the same friendly person,  she catered to us over the top service, food was excellent as usual, my husband had the Etoufee fish, I had lemon butter snapper, my son had the filet since it was my husband's bday she served him a special bday Flan, very nice then I had the bananas foster, out of this world.   Just want to say that Rosa is the best always goes above and beyond, we want to say with much gratitude THANK YOU ROSA!"}
{"text":"First time here and I like it. Customer service was great. The menu selection is good. Happy hour choice look good. I'll try it next time.  I ordered chef Trilogy, picked the tilapia dish and it was perfectly seasoning. I enjoyed it. I actually surprise for negative reviews. Overall my experience was great this evening."}
{"text":"Now the service was good.... apps we had bacon wrapped shrimp and it was good as well, salad with the house good,but at the prices I am not looking for just good and the staple plate Steak and Baked Potatoes... gritty meat not satisfying at all.... O forgot we tried 3 of the soups clam chowder gets a 3 out of 5 lobster bisque gets a 5 and the gumbo only a 2 from me, had no umph at all, puzzling to all of us the water had a dirty pipe water ish taste to it....not a return spot for us"}
{"text":"The food was very good, we had the planked salmon with a side of king crab and for appetizers we had calamari and crab with artichoke dip. The chairs are wood and not very comfortable to sit for a period of time.  But over all a great experience."}
{"text":"Eh.   It really was just OK. The waitress let the dishes pile up on our table and didn't stop by often enough to refill drinks and check on us. The food took pretty long to prepare and there wasn't any apology or explanation.   Because we were meeting old friends, we were in a celebratory and lingering mood.   The restaurant was empty but we felt pressure to leave. We tipped well, so I don't think that was the issue... The staff sure was quick to clear the table after the tab was paid. Oy. What an AWKWARD way to do business!  The hostess (kind of) made up for it, though. She took a bunch of tourist-y photos of our reunion.  (Outside the establishment, of course...)  I definitely won't be revisiting this place.  There are just too many restaurant options out there, Landry's. Your food wasn't great enough to justify service like that."}
{"text":"I came here to have dinner for the first time and although I didn't dislike this place, I didn't love it either.  Food: 3/5 - Broiled stuffed shrimp with rice pilaf and literally two stalks of broccoli. My friends ordered all you can eat crab legs for $50 and they thought the crab was delicious; however, they were a bit soggy and hard to break. I ordered the Captain's Punch for $5 off the happy hour menu and it was pretty good and a plentiful drink for its price. Score.   Service: 2.5/5 - Our waitress was nice and mostly attentive; however, she had to ask her manager twice if we were allowed to use the Yelp deal for free dessert, and then to see if my friend could use her concierge gift certificate. The Yelp deal situation was understandable, but when my friend also wanted to use his deal, she brought out the dessert AFTER she found out both deals wouldn't work in the same table. Then, she stated that the concierge gift certificate couldn't be used because she thought it was another offer. A gift certificate is not an offer, Lady.   As for the dessert, save the calories. We ordered the bananas foster and creme brûlée. Both together receive a 3.5/5. The wrap used for the bananas foster was stale but the flavor was okay. The creme brûlée wasn't bad so I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Seafood was wonderful and unusual. Stay away from the Bar.......K is a witch with a lousy attitude.  She serves you her way and then BItches at you when you correct her. K when you sneeze and blow your noise...... Wash your hands!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! We had oyster, mussels, and shrimp cocktail. Everything came out perfectly. It's strange that this restaurant has such low rating."}
{"text":"Made reservations in advance, arrived a few minutes early (7:20).   Mentioned that my son-in-law would be arriving about 8:10 from work and they said that the front doors are locked at 8 and he wouldn't be able to get in.   Asked to talk to the manager and she said \"nope, doors get locked at 8:00\".  He won't get in\"   Why when we made the reservations the day before didn't someone tell me that they close at 8:00. Our reservations were for 7;30 -  amazing.   Glad we left there immediately and went to Macaroni Grill next door.   Food was fabulous and the service was tremendous -  Will not ever eat at Landrys again -"}
{"text":"I tried, I really tried to find something that would get this place another star but I couldn't stretch that far.  This place has about 50 tables of which 4 were occupied when we got here. Literally the whole main dining room had two tables filled. Our server was less than attentive. She was not friendly and everything we needed we had to call for her to come by. The food was anything but edible. The fried shrimp ( remember the restaurant name has Seafood House in it ) was over breaded and tough. How can a chain as Landry's mess up shrimp and fries especially at $22 dollars per plate.  We mentioned it to the skill lacking server and she said she was \"sorry about that\". She got one plate removed from our bill but told me I had eaten to much of mine to have the manager remove it. I ate the fries first so the plate looked like I had eaten more. I am a local and this place reminds me of a tourist trap. Unfortunate as I have eaten at laundry's in other cities and been pleased.  Eater beware!"}
{"text":"Landry's has a great happy hour with extended hours on the weekend. Monday-Friday, 3-9. Saturdays and Sundays, 11-9.  They have an extensive drink menu, cocktails, martinis, beer and wine.  For this visit we had the fish tacos, stuffed shrimp, sliders and calamari.  The only thing that lacked any spices or flavoring was the calamari.  It was completely devoid of seasoning.  We also ordered the clam chowder and the waiter was nice enough to bring us a sample of the lobster bisque to try.  He was also helpful with recommendations.  There were two slider options and he let us know that one order came with two and one with three so that was appreciated."}
{"text":"I'm so mad at this place I don't even want to talk about it, but since it was so bad I must talk about it. The service was HORRIBLE! Even after talking to the manager it was still HORRIBLE! Bad attitude and bad service all around; slow, inconsiderate, rude, and all the bad words in the dictionary bad! -!@#$%^& Long story short: the restaurant was empty and it took them two hours to make our food, on top of that, orders were missing, so then we had to wait an additional hour, I swear we spent half our day waiting, waiting, and waiting.  The only good thing about this place is the Lobster Bisque (it was so good and flavorful!) and the Mai Tai, which had fruits which made the drink fruity, just the way I like it since it was still strong, but the then service killed my buzz, boo to Landry's!"}
{"text":"Don't ever go here they are slow and don't care about the patrons. Food wasn't bad but nothing to write home about and with over a hour wait for food when there is barely anybody in the restaurant is unacceptable. And complaining didn't help anything but my peace of mind so save yourself some time and money. Not worth it not even worth a star but I can't rate it any lower I wish they had a middle finger emoji to put in this review smh."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, $15 lunch box has great choices, and comes in 2 courses. Had the crawfish  etouffee was a large portion that I took home for a later meal. Service was good, no long wait, nor was it crowded."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Houston so I grew up on Landry's in Houston, Kemah, and Austin.  It was always to the freshest best seafood in town.  Decided to treat my wife and daughter for  lunch at Landry's in Vegas.  Food was okay, just okay.   I ordered the fried seafood platter and they split the broiled seafood platter.  We were all disappointed.  My fried seafood platter seemed like everything came from SYSCO foods all ready prepared frozen foods. Nothing tasted fresh.  I had a gift card and just left the remainer of the balance for the  tip because I will not be back.   Gone too far downhill for the prices.  Landry's is supposed to be the Flagship of the Landry chain....not any more."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE and more HORRIBLE, I'm not sure if it was our server, management or the entire restaurant.  so disgusted I'm not really sure where I should start. Well, we were seated fairly quickly and the restaurant being empty at 800 should not have been a strong indication that this wasn't a good place.   We immediately started to have problems when our waiter came over, he seemed to be very nervous taking our table and he started sweating and his hands became unsteady. He took our drink and appetizer orders and after 15 minutes he returned only to ask us were we ready to place a drink and appetizer order. I said to him you did that 15 minutes ago and his response was \"I wasn't sure everyone was ready because everyone did not order a drink or appetizer  Then it went down hill from there. We placed orders with my wife getting the all you can eat crab legs and now it's 845 and they close at 930. At 915 my wife gets a plate of (2) TWO crab legs .   Unacceptable,so we call the manager over and he says he'll fix it. 935 and still no crab legs delivered so at this point we are ready to go. We ask for our sever and we get a female sever saying she's going to take over and that we can sit here ordering crab legs until my wife gets full. 9:50 and still no crab legs.  They said the restaurant would stay open for us so that we can continue to order her crab legs. Not happening, I don't want a pissed off a cook making my food because he has to stay late.  Two hours of my time wasted and left here starving will never return! Not sure if our first sever was racist, high or something else but he clearly did not want to wait on us. And furthermore they made us pay for food we didn't even eat.   I spoke to the GM of restaurant and he had a sincere apology and he promised better from his staff"}
{"text":"Maybe I am biased as I am originally from Louisiana where food is quite good. But I think the Vegas Landry's chef must have snoozed through cooking class or maybe his eyesight is so poor he/she can't see what he/she is cooking? Now for the Big fish fry (referring to the chef). I ordered cranberry pecan crusted Mahi Mahi. For starters the server forgot to bring my appetizer. I asked for lemon with my soda and I got lime. The bread was a bit stale and the fish very dry and overcooked. It was served with Risotto that at first appeared tasty but lacked any flavor. The server was very nice and offered to get the manager but I did not want to make a fuss. Overall, I wouldn't feed their food to my dog and not sure I would eat it if it were the apocalypse and it was the only food to be found. So I left broke and hungry. Venture here at your own risk! You have been forewarned."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch twice since our office moved across the street.   It is very ambient, service is great and the food is even better.  The best server is Donnie-always attentive and offers assistance when you can't decide on a dish..i am diabetic so i am limited on what i can eat in one sitting-i will be coming back often and dont forget to become a loyalty member."}
{"text":"I've driven past Landry's for years and finally decided to try it. I am glad that I did. The decor is very warm and friendly so I felt at ease right away. My server was very helpful and walked me through the extensive menu.  Among the three items I had that night, two of them were outstanding. Those items were the New England clam chowder and the crab cakes.  The crab cakes were mostly (85%) crab meat and were delicious. The chowder was among the best I have ever had.  My salmon was also quite good but not as great as the other items. The bread service was a real treat because they offer old time very thick bread sticks which reminded me of the wonderful ones I remember from my childhood.   I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Although I have had many a good meal here, tonight was utter disappointment and I was a walkout.   Hostess said there would be a 15-20 minute wait for my party of one. With a less than half-filled dining room it was obvious they were understaffed   Was offered a seat at the near empty bar. Five minutes before the female bartender asked what I wanted to drink. Got the drink and then stared at the menu and tv for another 10 minutes while she made drinks and I walked out the door. And the folks in the lobby were still waiting."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here more frequently but unfortunately the quality of food seems to have gone downhill. Landry's has turned into just another cookie-cutter, Red Lobster-y fish house,  serving up over-priced, mediocre seafood. The menu was  recently changed, and the only thing that I really liked was, of course, removed. The service is acceptable, but nothing to write home about. Overall, I gave Landry's 3 stars because they have become blurringly average. There are far too many choices in town now for you to waste your time or your money here."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my family to Oyster Bar for their last dinner in Vegas. Unfortunately, they got lost and by the time we got there, the line was already 20 people deep. My dad suggested we try Landry's Seafood across the street, which is how we ended up here.   The meal started off decent enough. The happy hour menu had some nice appetizers to share including the onion strings, calamari, and firecracker shrimp. My dad raved about how well-battered and fried the onion strings were. It was good, but I wasn't as impressed. I really enjoyed the shrimp, but there were literally only 7 pieces of the small, fried shrimp (making it $1 per shrimp).   Moving on to the entrees, I got the crawfish étouffée and substituted my house salad with the lobster bisque. The bisque was literally 3 parts cream, 1 part salt, and trace amounts of elemental lobster. It was inedible. The saltine crackers were stale, which didn't help matters. On the flip side, I did enjoy the crawfish étouffée to an extent. There was bountiful amounts of crawfish meat, but not enough rice to go with the salty base. The fish & chips, shrimp po-boy, and burger that the rest of my family ordered didn't fare much better.   While the food was lackluster and somewhat abysmal, the service was great. But, If Oyster Bar has a long wait and you're having thoughts of walking across the street for seafood, think again. You're better off hitting up a cheaper Vegas buffet for your money."}
{"text":"It is refreshing to have someone wants to wait on you. Kia was knowledgeable, friendly and very accommodating With someone with two toddlers. The manager was helpful as well THANK YOU :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Happy Hour Menu again this evening at a bar of this great restaurant.  The menu items are varied and we've sampled many of them in the past few months and all were delicious. The only reason this wasn't 5 star is that the wait staff seemed to be a bit short handed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Got the all you can eat crab legs for $50 with my sister in law and they tasted dried out like they were someone else's reheated left overs. Then both of us ended up with very upset stomachs about 30 mins after. So basically we paid $60 each to get diarrhea. Not happy!"}
{"text":"below avg....Red Lobsteresque"}
{"text":"Ok being it wasn't that packed the food took awile to get out and the waitress did one of those impressive take our order without writing it down , just to get it wrong and sent back to the kitchen but after it was said and done the food was excellent and the service was alright , The shrimp was spicy then normal but good ,"}
{"text":"I'm advocate seafood eater!! I came across this place by accident. I like the ambience, the staff is welcoming in a down to earth home sort of a way yet sophisticated. I've had the seafood platter, gumbo, garlic bread and cucumber Martini so far. Not disappointed at all. I definitely recommend if you are visiting or a new local and want something more like home this is a good place to visit."}
{"text":"Hard to find a moderately-priced steak/seafood restaurant in Las Vegas but this one was perfect. The food was good but the service (manager Bruce & our server Rachel) was truly exceptional. It was my husband's birthday and we were with a couple we hadn't seen in several years. What a pleasure to enjoy a good meal, excellent service in a quiet, lovely atmosphere. Unlike other restaurants in Las Vegas (and, sadly, elsewhere in the U.S.), we could actually talk to each other without having to deal with horrible, loud music. Finally, while it's sometimes hard to trust a server's suggestions, everything Rachel suggested was wonderful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Darin and I have been coming here for happy hour since we moved to Vegas!  I can't believe I've never left a review. The bartenders have never been the same but most of them have been awesome!  We are never disappointed with the food or the service!  They have happy hour almost all day on Saturdays!  Salads have arrived!  Time to eat!"}
{"text":"Questionable Service! My husband and I just had a amazing dinner at laundry's however our server made us feel like we didn't belong. He scolded me for giving my husband some of my food, while his other table ordered the same thing and was sharing and he said nothing in fact he gave them double. Then he literally brings me 2crab legs while again he brings the table next to us a double portion. Almost insinuating I better not share. By the way I paid for two meal and case yo where wondering. He barely came to the table and when he did he would not even give us eye contact. Then I ask for the bill and it take him forever to bring it when he finally does we put the money in (our bill was $98 so we put a $100) he looks in there I guess asumming we were not going to tip him, rolled his eyes and snatched the bill and left. I have never felt so insulted. My husband and I both work in the industry and there is a certain amount of respect that's come with the job. I have never felt like my patronage of a business was so under appreciate which is really sad because the food was exactly. I have eaten at Landry's all over the country and never experienced anything like this before. Severs please don't treat paying customers like this"}
{"text":"Very very expensive seafood! Good kind service but very expensive for what your getting."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was not. The line was so long at the Oyster Bar that we came here. We were not impressed with the food. Was hoping for authentic Cajun cuisine, this missed the mark."}
{"text":"This is my 1st review and I'm taking it way back, over a year ago to our visit at Landry's. I had a gift card for this restaurant that I picked out as a reward from work. Came at lunch with my fam of 5, my parents and Aunty.   First off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all.   Worst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff.   Anywho I just wanted to get this bad visit (service and food) off my chest. Unfortunately after all this time still not forgotten. Hopefully I can move on. Bad on me I didn't question the gift card issue more(although and at least we spoke to manager at the time). And demand a new soup for my dad. A bad but learning experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"We were driving by, and I noticed the restaurant haven't been in one for years. So, we thought we stopped for dinner.  This was a good choice. The service was 5 stars, the waitress was attentive and the wait wasn't long for the food. We started with salad and bread. My husband didn't care for his garden salad but my wedge was great. This is why I didn't give five stars.  He had a shrimp fettuccini dish and I had a stuffed shrimp dish. Both dinners were very good, I teased my husband about mopping up all the sauce with the bread. We also opted for a dessert. The waitress recommended the Crème Boule and it was great. (The strawberries on the dessert were past their prime.) My husband asked if I was going to lick the plate.  All in all a good dinner, we had cocktails too, the Cadillac Margarita was fabulous.. Dinner was promptly brought out when we finished our salads."}
{"text":"Met a few folks here for a really late lunch, then into happy hour.   Restaurant as a lot of space in a shopping center with plenty of parking.    Had the crab stuffed mushrooms appetizers, very good.  I ordered their salmon, which was served with broccoli and rice pilaf.    Salmon was excellent!   Broccoli was good.   Rice... Very salty.   A friend had the tilapia.  She was impressed, which is hard to do on food.   For happy hour after downing a grey goose tonic, I decided to try their mango mojito.   Don't do it.    It doesn't taste like mango, not fresh, and is super sweet.   This is listed as a signature drink.   Was horrible.    I sent it back.   Interestingly, the waitress said she was sorry I didnt like it because it was a popular drink.  She was really friendly about taking it off the bill."}
{"text":"Well Landry's is just ok.  I have eaten here a lot over the years due to an old job where I earned comps here.  I am always hoping that it will be better, but it is always just ok. Same goes for the service.  Some servers are rock stars and some are just awful.    So the highlights: -The crawfish étouffée is delicious every time I have had it.  If you haven't tried it, go for it! -The steak is pretty good here since you can add wonderful toppings like crab, shrimp, mushroom sauces. Yummy! -The po'boys are pretty good.  They aren't as good as in NOLA, but they are good for West Coast standards. -The desserts are all really good.  You can't go wrong with any of them! -The Landry's Select Club works here and you can earns bonus points for comps.  The lowlights: -The fried platters are all rather bland.  Everything tastes the same and just runs together in the flavor category. -The service is very hit and miss. Chances are you will wait forever for refills, to order your food, and to be checked on when you need service.  So overall, the place is ok, but nothing special."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque is excellent. Maria was our waitress and she was great. The only tip I would give is that the portions are huge, I was stuffed after the soup and bread and salad that came to the table beforehand that I boxed up dinner to go."}
{"text":"This place was good. Came here tonight for anniversary dinner. Was really dead for a Saturday night.. overall the food was pretty good.  1. App - Spinach artichoke dip - Really good, I would get it again.  Nice crab flavor and quality dip. 2.  Side Salad with dinner - I was pleasantly surprised by their house dressing, it was a balsamic creamy dressing with mustard? I forget the name. When the waiter said the name, I thought oh boy that sounds horrible - but it was actually awesome! 3. Lobster Bisque - Was okay, a little too creamy in my opinion. My husband had to add salt and pepper. 4.  I had the seafood pasta as entree, I forget the name.  It had shrimp, mussels, scallops.   I was sort of expecting a red tomato sauce, but my bad, I must have misinterpreted the menu, it was just spaghetti with diced tomatoes and mushrooms, there wasnt really a sauce on the pasta, maybe some oil. The pasta besides that was plain and without much flavor. I had to add salt and cheese. 5. My husband got an accompaniment of crab legs with his entree- those were amazing - nice sweet crab, very tasty.  The waiter forgot to ring in the crab which he apologized for, I was hoping he'd take it off the bill because we got it when we were both done eating the entrees. But that's okay, stuff happens, the waiter was really nice and owned up to it so that was good. I don't really care too much about that.    I don't know if I will be coming back super soon, because I am sure there are other seafood spots to check out, but this place was pretty good overall and the price not bad.  Their booths are uncomfortable though, I do have to say that."}
{"text":"The happy hour (only in the bar area) is great. Good prices on drinks and a lot of good food options. Their calamari, peel and eat shrimp, and Nawlins baked oysters are very tasty choices. The surroundings are nice...even if you sit at the bar because all the booths are taken, you'll still enjoy it. And best of all it's not just some weird two hour window."}
{"text":"I don't even want to leave one star! Wow I haven't been here in probably 7 years or so a few friends wanted seafood and I remember it being amazing! Wow was I wrong!! This place was so run down I was embarrassed! Our guests didn't even eat their food but they hate to complain so didn't even say a thing but being a good waitress she should have noticed when only one bite was touched they weren't happy. Appetizers sucked and were dry. Waitress didn't know a thing about the menu and was all over the place when asking questions. Lobster was chewy, steak was tough. I just cannot believe how much this place changed! Stay away if You're looking for seafood this isn't the spot to go."}
{"text":"I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vegas happy hour spots. Been coming here for years and finally decided to leave a review to let others know about this place. The shrimp en brochette, and the oysters are a must have. Good food good prices."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came to celebrate or anniversary we had a great time  the food and service was wonderful are server andrea made it very special with a little dessert and made me and my husband feel  special. .we well be back..for future celebrations"}
{"text":"For happy hour:    Great value at $2/$2.50 for beers, $5 for specialty drinks, and $3-$7 apps.  The food was ample and very good.  The stuffed shrimp was great and the crab balls were very good as well.      While the bar is a little sleepy you'll have a good time if Big John, a rambunctious regular, is there."}
{"text":"I came here years ago but just thought it was OK. This time, tried Happy Hour (Daily, BTW)- surprisingly very good. My husband said \"We have to come here again.\" The Happy Hour menu ($3/$4/$5) is available at the Bar but had booth seating in addition to the stools surrounding the bar. The alcohol ranges from $2-$5- 28 selections; beer, well, & cocktails.  We had the Fish Tacos (2)  with shoestring fries $5, Buffalo Chicken Sliders (3) with shoestring fries $5, and Crab, Spinach, & Artichoke Dip (huge) with pico de gallo & tortilla chips $5. Everything was delicious. The fish tacos had chipotle ranch sauce, which was flavorful and zesty. The Buffalo Sliders (the server suggested this) had just the right amount of spice. The dip was huge and the spinach really gave it an extra touch. My husband thought the fries were better than \"In & Out\" - still don't understand the fascination with that place, but that's another conversation. Also, my husband had two beers. The bill? A little over $21.00. We didn't finish everything. Great service, although very busy, still tended to us.  The server told us that people are surprised with the portion sizes- that they expect tapas sized plates, but the happy menu items are full sized here. My husband already knows what he wants to try next time."}
{"text":"It's been while since I've been to Landry's but since I recently started working nearby, we tried to see what's close by for that after work \"relief\" and Landry's has a sign right outside for a pretty awesome sounding Happy. Hour.  We came in for Happy Hour which was an awesome 3-7pm time frame. It was in the middle of the week so it I wasn't that busy, but the closer to 7 it got, it did get a little busier.  Their HH menu has some pretty good options. Unfortunately the Calamari was fishy but the Fish tacos-- amazing flavor for the price, kinda had a back end fishy taste though.  Landry lager was delish! It was the only drink that I had so I can't really comment on anything else.  Def coming back for HH!"}
{"text":"I came here because i love seafood. However the seafood was not as good as i expected. It was ok. Also the prices are a bit high to not be satisfied. I probably will not be back here..."}
{"text":"Mommy and Me day with my Mom!!!!!! Jared the manager helped us with our to go order. He had a very good understanding of the menu and food allergies . He was able to suggest quite a few different dishes for us. Look forward to the second visit where we can actually sit down to me."}
{"text":"Our server's name was Laura and she truly earned this 5 star rating.  She was very informative and throughout the whole dining experience steered us in the right direction at every decision.  The service was great and the food did not in anyway let us down. The portions were large and delicious.  I will absolutely be back here."}
{"text":"We came here with Landry's rewards card. The waiter is very nice and the store manager comes by twice (maybe it is before the busy dinner time so he can visit each table more often). The Margarita with corona is really refreshing. :) We ordered shrimp wrapped with bacon. It is quite rich with butter dressing on the top. But if you are the butter lover or a teenager, you might love it very much. :) We each ordered the 4 courses for $19.99. What a bargain! It comes with salad, appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. Everything is great!......(banana ice cream is very sweet. :) )"}
{"text":"This was my 1st trip to #Landry's even though I have lived in the neighborhood for years!! Im just NOT a big seafood fan. But I heard word they had great steaks & burgers plus Happy Hour specials.Soooooo...  Here we are on a Wednesday night around 8pm -pretty light crowd but the place looks like its trying to hard to be  ritzy for a chain steak & seafood place-you know formal but jeans are ok.  There's a bar off to the side and a small lobster tank with 2 pathetic looking lobsters right as you enter the dining room. Boothes line the wall and small 4 chair table fill the room.  We were seated immediately in a booth and after about 10 minutes our waiter-#Jacob arrived to take our drink order. We went ahead and place our entire order since we were hungry & thirsty!!!  We decided to try their spin on a traditional app-Crab,Spinach& Artichoke dip and then the wife ordered the CRAB FEAST with a little of everything crab-Legs,Balls,Cakes and more. and I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye and Baked Potato.  The food came out alot faster than the 1st appearance-1st they brought a house salad with house dressing and the dip came out quick too.The dip was great-not fishy as I had feared but rather rich and creamy not unlike regular SPinach & artichoke dip.   The main course was FANTASTIC!! One of the best under $50 steaks I've ever had(actually ONLY $22) cooked perfectly mediem-rare seasoned well and smooth like butter:) You could literally cut it with a SPOON:)  The crab was less than impressive. ONLY 2 crab legs for $40!!! WTF!~!!! The Fried Crab Balls were awful-too much cornmeal or whatever and no flavor. The crab cake the same and the Au Gratin Crab Meat was just whack-Where's the CRAB,huh? Definitely a better deal to get a STEAM POT at Joe's Crab Shack or the Krazy Buffet all-you-can-eat crab for $15.  I will definitely go back for a steak or $5 sliders at Happy Hour but as far as SEAFOOD goes I'll pass."}
{"text":"This Place Sucks!!!!!!   So I came here because the Oyster Bar was a long wait. Sat down and the server was nice but the biggest problem was the wait it took over an hour to get our food in which the manager came over and asked is everything ok in which I said no it took an hour to get our food now instead of taking care of the customer she said let me find out what happen so I'm writing this to tell the local people don't eat here the manager suck and on top of that the food was terrible.  I'm so glad I won't be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"Just got back from having an early dinner there, what can I say, service excellent, food excellent, atmosphere excellent, ate so much I almost hurt myself, I felt like I was at a restaurant in the French Quarter.  I had the oyster roll, it was sooooooo good, I though my tongue was going to smack my brain silly1"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service provided by the bartender and staff at Landrys. Enjoyed an appetizer before ordering some take-out.  Quality of food was good but not spectacular.  (For that reason, am unable to offer a 5 star rating.)  The restaurant was a pleasant break from the strip and the casino action.  Strongly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Landrys a couple times now and each time we've been there, we've always had exceptional customer service. The young lady that waited on us the first time even sang \"Happy Birthday\" to me with her magnificent voice. The second time we went, we had a lady who waited on us who kept talking and talking and talking. She was very pleasant though, but all we needed was time to eat and bond as dinners like these are our family bonding time. The food was good, everyone enjoyed their dishes that they ordered.  We will continue to go to this restaurant as food was good and affordable."}
{"text":"Landry's is a seafood restaurant that  is comparable to Red Lobster with  a Cajun twist. It's part of the chain that owns Claim Jumpers. We came here for a date night where I was hoping to find Sea Bass. Unfortunately they didn't have any so I ordered the steak and lobster, with dirty rice. The lobster was tasteful and buttery. I asked for medium rare steak which typically makes the steak nice and tender. The steak was a bit tough and overcooked for my taste. The rice had a weird wet texture that you can't tell from the picture. It was soggy which in my experience of making rice is not a good thing.   The Banana's Foster was my favorite part of the meal. How could you go wrong with vanilla ice cream, caramel and bananas? It's one of my go to desserts that hardly ever disappoints. The service was also very good and prompt.   If I could make a suggestion it would be that they find a new dirty rice recipe. It's sad when I would rather eat the dirty rice at Popeye's then here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Shrimp en brochette, amazing. Happy Hour, amazing. 19.99 lobster tail, amazing. House salad dressing, amazing. Rice pilaf, amazing. Service, amazing. SMH."}
{"text":"No higher than two stars. Service friendly. Food expensive, yet very basic. No wow factor here. Chart House a better choice. Medium crowd, yet they put us right at tables next to one another limiting privacy."}
{"text":"I'm kinda surprised about the negative reviews from this place, because I really like it.  The happy hour is great, but I came for lunch this time. We ordered the Firecracker Shrimp and the Calamari as an appetizer. The shrimp was sooo yummy, and the calamari was good, but wish there were more hot peppers in there.  Then I had a cup of the Lobster bisque, which was also good, and the seafood Stuffed a Jalapeños.  They were great, but I was so full by this time, I could barely get through one of them.  I also had a delicious peach sangria that was made with fresh peaches and strawberries, and finished with a basil leaf. This was really a very light refreshing drink that is perfect for summer."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good choice for a place for not being on directly on the strip& pretty nice. The food was great! Yum yum.. There was three of us and we sat in the bar, not too busy for a Friday evening. Nice & quiet and would be great if you wanted a romantic dinner. The staff was very friendly and always helpful. I would come back here again, in fact just might do that when we return. We come to Vegas often and love trying out new places to eat.."}
{"text":"We made reservations here through open table but I had called the day before to confirm our reservation and to let them know that it was our anniversary and we were specifically coming for the all you can eat king crab legs.  This was our first time eating here. When we arrived, a table was ready for us; we did not have to wait. And amazingly we were given personalized menus that said 'Happy 15th wedding anniversary Joel and Veronica' at the top. We were so impressed!!  The hostess was so nice to us and our waitress was awesome. She continued bringing out more crab legs every time we asked, no delay. Sometimes for all you can eat specials they take their time bringing out the refills but she didn't do that at all. The homemade potatoes were really good; the ranch dressing was out of this world. The only reason I took away one star was because the king crab legs were mediocre. They weren't horrible but I've had better. Overall though they still deserve the four stars because of the service, the ambience, and we definitely had our fill of crab legs."}
{"text":"Disappointingly average.  The salad was generous and a strong point as was the Bananas Foster desert which was a real treat. More than enough for two to split.  The problem was the overdone fish. Both types were tasteless and mine was even tough.  For a seafood restaurant one expects the named style to be well prepared.  Service was excellent and parking was easy. Attractive  decor but not too plush."}
{"text":"3 stars are for the staff and management, they were all very attentive and the service was great! I drive by this spot all the time and finally made it a point to drop in. The food.....is truly really bad. The staff was super great tho! The good was just......yea....horrible :/ I think even the bartender and server felt bad when they saw us hardly eating. The manager table touched and we hate to complain but we had to say how bad the food was. They offered to get us something else but we didn't want to risk it. Again, can't emphasis enough that this relieves is only about the food! The Service really was great!"}
{"text":"Very pretty setting with low noise volume. But the portions were much too large for lunch. Attentive service, but the waiter was wearing cloying aftershave that lingered over the table after he left. Doesn't sit well with seafood. Too much fried food as the appetizer for the lunch box."}
{"text":"The nice thing about this place is that even on a busy weekend night in Vegas, you can still find a easy place to sit for dinner.  The food however does leave something to be desired.  I ordered the lobster bisque and wasn't impressed, I was expecting way more in taste and way too skimpy on the lobster.  Their mussels were alright, nothing to call home and rave about, cooked right and the broth was decent.  Oysters were good, probably the best thing I ate that night.  For the price, food was mediocre--definitely worth eating somewhere else"}
{"text":"To put it bluntly there are better places to eat at for the money you would spend here. Landrys tries to be an upscale restaurant but really falls short.   To start I had the lobster bisque and it was good! I wish I had just stuck to the bisque as my crab cakes were disappointing. There was a bit too much breading and not enough crab. Additionally they put some weird sauce on the bottom of the plate which  I felt did not compliment the cakes.  My Freind had the clam chowder which she said was also ver good.   The atmosphere is slightly upscale- maybe more along the lines of \"I want to be an upscale restaurant but don't know how.\" Our server Rosa was very disinterested in us from the beginning when we told her water to start and let is look over the menu. She then proceeded to try and sell up some rewards card for $25.00- all of which happened before we really got to look at the menu and order..... Not the way you want to start off dinner!"}
{"text":"I don't live by a Landry's, but I'm a Landry's VIP card holder (from one of their subsidiaries) so I had to try it when i came to Vegas. First off, let me tell you this is one of the best happy hours I've ever had in my life.   I sat down to eat in the restaurant first, food was VERY tasty. their salad was good, dressing was a little too tangy for me, but no real complaint. I got the Ponchartrain stuff shrimp, super good.   but then after we hit the bar.  they have these great mango mojitos, ONLY $5!!!  if you only go here for one reason, have it be the happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here by default since we Waited an hour at The Oyster Bar line across the street, where only 3 parties were seated, we decided to give Landrys a try.  Without any reservations we were seated immediately.   Lobster Bisque: 2/5 very few pieces of lobster which were very small. It was cold- not even warm. A lil too creamy and not too flavorful.   Crawfish Étouffée: 5/5 **DELICIOUS** served w/ fluffy white rice & temperature was just right. Very delicious (did I say that already ? Lol) every night had crawfish and was seasoned just right. Consistent  was perfect !  Shrimp Grits: 3/5 The shrimp tasted old and stale. Grits were average and the sauce was a bit over whelming. There was just too much onions.   Bananas Foster: 4/5 The sauce and banana was poured over the vanilla icecream when served. The crispy crepe dipped in chocolate was chewy and sweet. Perfect accompaniment. Sauce was not too sweet. Delicious ending to our dinner   Our dinner included the house salad which was just your average mixed greens. The dressing was on the tart side.   Now for the service...IMPECCABLE. From the hostess to our waiter- ***** FIVE STARS***** we were seated promptly without reservations and our waiter wasn't over bearing. He checked on us at the right moments and our food was served when we ended each course.   Will dine here for sure when were back in town."}
{"text":"Love the fried fish with fries and onion rings It was cooked with a corn meal coating which made it light and tasty!"}
{"text":"To save you the read below go to Red Lobster for better service.     Food was okay but service is where the issue was. For these prices I would expect a much more attentive staff. From when we walked in till we got the check.  We walked in and it looked like they just opened, fairly empty, about 4 tables. It took about 5 minutes till we were acknowledged. They sat us at a pretty small table for the amount of people, but I don't like to complain before I get my food because I to worked in the food service industry and assumed it was for a reason. We told them a few more people were coming and and we needed an extra chair, they said they would get it when they arrived, they didn't. I grabbed the chair and the settings. Bread and drinks were not brought out unless asked for and even then we had to remind them.  So from the time we got there till we left was about 2 hours 10 minutes so you can guess how long we waited for each thing to occur throughout."}
{"text":"We were here for Ruben's company's holiday party. They closed off the back dining area with partitions and since there were just 20 of us, there was a lot of space. The service was great! We had 2-3 servers and runners bringing food and making sure our drinks stayed full. It was a good time.   Crab, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip ($13.75): Served with pico de gallo and tortilla chips. This was a nice dip. Good flavors and the crab managed to come through.   Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms ($11.75): Roasted Cremini mushrooms, mushroom cream, and parmesan. The mushrooms had a lot of stuffing, which was nice, but I didn't really care for the overall dish.  Crispy Onion Strings and Jalapeños ($8.75): Really thin fried onion strings piled high with red bell peppers and ranch dressing. These were tasty!  Firecracker Shrimp ($10.50): Tempura-fried shrimp with a creamy sweet chili glaze. I think we've all had this shrimp somewhere. I've had it at Bonefish Grill and the clubhouse at Anthem Country Club. I don't think the dish even had different names and they always taste the same. Anyway, I know it's terribly unhealthy, but that glaze is delicious and it's fantastic with the tempura shrimp. I love it!  Famous Salad Bowl: Served with all entrees. I didn't see it on the menu a la carte. I don't know what type of dressing is used, but I did not like it. Plus, I hate when my salad is drenched with dressing. It's so unappetizing. The bowl was actually FILLED with dressing after the salad was removed. The contents of the salad were unmemorable.  Shrimp Jambalaya ($21.75): The usual suspects, Andouille sausage, shrimp, Tasso ham, okra; served with Jasmine rice. Ruben and I love Jambalaya and we usually order it if it's on the menu. This one was all right. I didn't like the broth which was sweeter than I prefer.  Ribeye ($32.75): Chargrilled and served with a Salt-Crusted Baked Potato. The steak was disappointedly thin. Not enough flavor. The potato was decent.  Bananas Foster: The sauce was placed in a separate container to pour over the vanilla ice cream; fantastic since I hate when the ice cream is completely melted. Although, the ice cream was placed in a thin fried bowl that was disgusting and inedible. It reeked of old, overused frying oil and whatever was fried in it (like our appetizers). I can't believe they would use the same oil to fry their seafood and their desserts. So gross.  Cinnamon Bread Pudding: The flavors weren't bad (mostly due to the tasty caramel sauce), but the bread pudding itself wasn't very good. The bread was really dense and didn't have much flavor or moisture. It was just a large cube of compacted bread.  Key Lime Pie: I found the pie much too sweet with not enough tang from the key lime. Which is odd since I find a lot of key lime pies too sour!  Accommodations were fantastic and the staff was wonderful. The food, on the other hand, left much to be desired. It wasn't my cup of tea. Unexpectedly, I did enjoy a couple dishes, but they weren't enough to overcome the rest of the lackluster meal."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:20: dining room empty, bar empty.  Ordered 2 drinks and 3 waters from the bar.  15 minutes later they were served.  Ordered appetizer (coconut shrimp and crab balls).  They were served on a plate of shoestring onion rings.  It all tasted the same... Like old oil.  Decided to order the four-course meal for $19.99..... Appetizer, salad, entree and desert.  Placed order at 5:50... Plenty of time to eat and get to The Smith Center in time for our 7:30 show.  Wrong.... After 40 minutes of nothing...we started dropping \"hints\" such as:  \"can you bring it out as quickly as possible cause we have a show!\"  After 45 minutes the calamari and fried zucchini arrived...  Terrible-- tasted just like the greasy crab balls.... No flavor.  Another hint about the show.  Salad arrives with heavy dressing.  Finally, we asked for the manager and offered to pay for what we'd eaten, but it was 7pm and we had to go.  Manager boxed up our meal and refused to let us pay (thus the two stars).  We ate our boxed meal in the car on our way (very classy).  It tasted just like all the other food!  Very disappointing!  I wish in could say it was all the kitchen's fault, but the bartenders/servers rarely came by...  We had to flag them down for water refills.  I can say everyone was very friendly.  I can say the manager did not have to give us everything for free...  But even he recognized the wait was unacceptable.  When we rushed out at 7:10pm, there were only a few tables occupied in the dining room and the bar was really quiet for a Friday night, especially considering its great location.  Im surprised they have been there so long.  2 stars is a stretch."}
{"text":"Classy seafood presentation done right!  I've enjoyed Landry's here in Las Vegas scattered over the last 7 years.  I first started eating there when I used to work at Television City at the MGM Grand.  We'd often receive gift certificates for eating there of up to $50.00 and it really was delicious!  Amazing shrimp and oyster Po-Boys, tasty steamed clams, and some of those platters just filled with different varieties of fish...man....I can still smell how amazing it was!  This is definitely a great 'night out' eatery too and my fiancée and I have enjoyed a few meals there over the last couple years.  I always order their lobster bisque which is truly exquisite and I cannot recommend their crab cakes enough!  It's nice to go eat in their bar for lunch as it's usually empty and quiet so you have the area practically to yourself during that time!  The dining room of course is lovely and very much resembles that of a ship's dining quarters.  I highly recommend giving Landry's a try if you're a seafood lover!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely terrible.  I would Never ever come here again I swear to god Red Lobster is better The drinks at the bar are good.  You will wait for your food It's over priced and just garbage I'll never recommend this place to anyone  This is in the top 3 of the worst meals in a restaurant I've ever had  I cannot believe I am even giving it a one star but that is my only option"}
{"text":"I really look forward to going out for seafood that night. However, I don't think I'll be going back. The food wasn't much to write home about, and the flavors were very bland. I'll look for someplace else in Las Vegas to enjoy my Seafood."}
{"text":"My father-in-law took my husband and I out to dinner at Landry's Seafood last night, and we all enjoyed our experience. We arrived around 6 PM and were promptly seated in a booth; however, we almost immediately switched to a table because the booth seats sink in quite a bit so you're almost eye level with the table! Throughout our meal the dining room remained quiet even though the restaurant was at least halfway full.   Our server Tina was very professional and helpful throughout the meal. She suggested several appetizers and entrees without being pushy, and she was also able to describe several dishes that we asked about.  My suggestion: Get the lobster tail. WOW this is good and buttery. We got one to split between the three of us and we DEVOURED it. I also recommend the Landry's Gumbo (which my husband ordered), which is a spicy and savory soup made with shrimp, rice, sausage, and other delicious tidbits. I ordered the Coastal Seafood Pasta, which was HUGE and came with a multitude of different seafood. Don't order either the Gumbo or the pasta if you don't like a fishy aftertaste; however, I love seafood and enjoyed both. We also got a slice of chocolate cake to go, which was quite good but not as rich as I expected.   My favorite part of the meal was my Captain's Punch cocktail, which came in a beautiful glass with a cherry and orange on the side. I could have easily put away a few more of those!  No complaints! Easily a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We went for a family birthday party and everyone in our group really enjoyed their meals. They printed a personalized \"happy birthday\" message at the top of our menus which was a nice touch. The service took about 2.5 hours which was slow but not awful for a party of 9 people. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had another early dinner before a show here. Appetizer and service were good, but the main dish, encrusted tilapia was dry."}
{"text":"Shrimp Embroche (sp) at happy hour is a must!! However, recent management changes have bumped out the old staff that worked in the bar area which is really sad....It used to be a place you'd go to because the staff gave that place life....personality....now, not so much...even the manager was not very accommodating....eat at the bar and leave..."}
{"text":"The whole reason for going here was for seafood.  The staff was excellent, but the seafood was the worst I have ever had!  I ordered shrimp cocktail, only ate one.  Was not good!  I also ordered scallops for dinner over rice......they were rubbery.  Clearly not fresh or overcooked.  Horrible!  The salad was with lettuce, not fresh romaine that has nutritional value.  Seems like Las Vegas is very old schooled, a lot of chain restaurants, not many farm to market.  They don't really concentrate on the quality of their food.  Giving people cheap food for the highest price.  It's sad.  I paid over $55 for this meal and appetizer with a lemonade, ridiculous!!!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful at the bar. The bartender was very attentive, but sadly the food was not that great. I had high hopes for this place because the Landry's chain has some great restaurants. I ordered the stuffed shrimp off the lunch menu. The shrimp was mostly filled with bland stuffing. The green beans had no seasoning and were over steamed. The rice pilaf tasted more bland than white rice. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish. I'd be willing to give this place another try to check out their all you can eat crab legs on Tuesday, but if that's another miss, I'll have to steer clear from this place."}
{"text":"Horrible hostess.  Did not even stay to eat!  For the prices of dinner, I would go next door."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the reviews here, the service is terrible. It took 20 minutes to order a drink at the bar when there were 2 bartenders and 7 customers, and to top it off they acted as if we were incovienincing them by ordering from them. We had a large party and the waitress seemed annoyed that she actually had to work on a Friday night when the place was mostly empty. The food is just mediocre and the prices are too high. I know I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If I were the GM of this place, all the waitstaff and cooks would cut loose."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for lunch and the experience was good, not great.  The food was so-so, but the service was excellent, so that brought the rating up.  For the price you pay here, the food should be better than Red Lobster, however it was not this time."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi was good, wouldn't say spectacular. Broccoli was tasty. I kind of expected it to be a bit better. The Bread cake was a solid dessert. Vegas has so many great choices that it can take a lot to stand out especially in the seafood and steak category."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my husband while visiting Vegas. When I lived in Las Vegas, this was one of our favorite places to dine. Their food was good and so was their awesome customer service.  I was so full off their appetizer (shrimp & artichoke dip and the crab fondue), I couldn't enjoy my main course."}
{"text":"The waiting line was too long at the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, so I ventured across the street to Landry's, hoping to enjoy a late seafood lunch on a piping hot Friday afternoon in Las Vegas. I can't complain about the wait staff, or possibly the cook because staff can only operate with the \"tools\" at hand. The oyster po' boy was very dry and lacked any character. I was thinking that the oysters were those that couldn't pass muster on the half shell - perhaps on the edge of the \"sell-by\" date. Perhaps Landry's is positioned as a family restaurant as quite a few diners were younger women with children. Not a problem for me, but add the odd music channel playing overhead at an unnecessarily loud volume and the \"sound stew\" became a distraction. As a \"faded foodie\", I must have to up my game on casual dining. The more experience one enjoys and the desire for smaller portions creates certain challenges in a city with plenty of great dining. I won't be returning soon to Landry's. They take their customers for granted."}
{"text":"I took my family here and wanted someplace more quiet that didn't have the rushed atmosphere you get at most restaurants along the strip. I did not go wrong with Landry's. I ordered the crawfish etouffee. I must say I haven't had etouffee this good outside of 'Nawlins. It was slightly different yet fully authentic. Perhaps this is the difference between Gulf Coast experience versus the New Orleans experience I read in an earlier review. The stuffed seafood mushroom appetizers are a treat as well. The bit of taste I got off my siblings' plates were all good. No complaints from anyone that day. They don't only cook seafood good, they make a decent rib-eye as well. Service was as good as it gets from a friendly, polite and thoughtful staff. Definitely worth a return trip next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"It might seem odd that a fellow from Louisiana, would hit up Landry's while he's in  Vegas, but I was just out stretching my legs and plopped down here for Happy Hour a time or two, as I was in the neighborhood. I never really ventured beyond the bar to the dining area of this establishment, as the drinks and small HH food menu were sustenance enough to keep me occupied and in one place and on one stool. I enjoyed drinking their Bloody Marys in the early evening as well."}
{"text":"Wilted iceberg lettuce to start the meal...then the \"fresh catch\" flounder...actually fresh thawed and microwaved soggy something or other, but NOT something you would order for 25.00 dollars.  What happened to this chain, it used to be OK and now STEER CLEAR.  The waitress was nice and attentive though. I wanted fish tonight and there aren't many places to choose from nearby, but I will never return here."}
{"text":"Taste * Laugh * Live   Stopped by this iconic seafood restaurant this afternoon for a little birthday lunch! I signed up for a Landry's club card years ago for $25 and since I faithfully receive $25 every year for my birthday! #Score  The crawfish bread $10.50 was amazing! Packed with flavor and the French bread had a nice crunch! Definitely a great appetizer to start with!   Blackened Shrimp Fettuccine $16.90 The Shrimp was cooked perfectly and the blackened seasoning wasn't overbearing. Very filling!  My mommy dearest ordered the seafood platter which was pretty basic but at $18.90 (pretty cheap) I know why. The oysters were very small but my mom shared they were pretty yummy. The \"Basa\" fish served is in the catfish family also known as Swai. This fish is extremely controversial and very inexpensive hence the $18.90 platter.   Overall lunch was great and I sincerely appreciate our server Brooklyn for being so polite and really knowing her stuff!   $44.17 total after redeeming my $25 birthday reward!!"}
{"text":"This review is for HAPPY HOUR ONLY!!  Came here with a bunch of friends on friday for happy hour which is from 3 to 7 I believe.  The place is cute but its not a date night kind of place.  Its like a family/old people fancy diner kind of a feel.  We sat at the bar and they have a good happy hour menu.  Select beers for only 2 bucks!!  How can you beat that??  Cocktails and wines for 5 dollars.  Food ranges from 4 to 7 i think.  Between us we got the edamame, the crab balls, fish taco, fried green tomatoes and the buffalo sliders.    Sliders were huge portions!  Came with fries.  Pretty decent for the price.  The friend green tomatoes were just ok.  I was really excited about it but it tasted like fried firm tomatoes.  The crab balls were a little dissapointing.  It has a lot of breading and the crab tasted a little fishy.  The bed of onion fries it came on was good though.  I would also say that the fish taco was ok.  They gave you a tiny dollop of quac, which was pretty good.  Otherwise it was decent.  Nothing too special or that memorable.    I was initially really excited to come here but after trying everything, I was underwhelmed.  Food is decently cheap but just lack flavor.  Atmosphere was meh... nothing fancy or sexy.   Service was good.  I think people just come here for the cheap drinks.  Would not come otherwise because dinner entrees are 20-40 bucks."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood.  I had the crab cake and I never had blue crab. First time, it was pretty damn good pricey but delicious and worth.  I also had the red snapper another first for me. I have always been scared to cook it at home. It was script and moist and taste fresh from the ocean which is my favorite taste from the seafood when you can taste sea salt.  I will definitely go back. I want to try there Tuesday nights. The have a sign stating endless snow crabs legs on Tuesday's for $50 that a steal if you can eat like me."}
{"text":"This is old southern seafood. The meals we had were fantastic. Service was very good. High class Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Last night I had the pleasure of holding an small event at Landry's Seafood House. The event went off without a hitch thanks to Tony Ramieh who was my main contact for the restaurant. He made sure that the drinks and food were all brought out in a timely matter and that dishes were prepared property.  We ordered many delicious menu items off the Happy Hour menu and I will be sure to come back and take part in there affordable Happy Hour.  The staff and atmosphere were delightful as well as the location was easy for our members to get to from all sides of town."}
{"text":"We went there to have a gumbo the other day. If you call that gumbo, then you need to take a trip to New Orleans, apparently no on at Landry's has. I had the shrimp gumbo and first of all the whole gumbo was really dark brown and just tasted like pepper. There was no other flavor. No tomatoes, no okra, no celery, no onions, nothing.  It was really not very good and based on the gumbo alone, I wouldn't bother returning to Landry's for anything.  Landry's started out in Louisiana?  Looks like they forgot what they were doing."}
{"text":"Only landrys ive ever been to and im never dissapointed. Tnite Tony was our Server and He was fabulous. I got the mahi mahi and it was really good! The landrys oysters are delish but u have to ask 4 them there so yummy! And Daniel the manager is AWSOME! U cant go wrong with landrys!!!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us had dinner recently at Landrys. Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.  The decor in the restaurant was fine.  Would go bak there again."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Landry's for an early dinner upon arrival to Vegas.  The waitress, Denise was great and if we could rate her, she would get 5 stars. One of us had the Southern Fried Fish and the other two ladies had the Tilapia dish.  Needless to say within about 45 minutes we were all sick.  We called the restaurant and told them what happened.  The response by the General Manager was he had to see if other people were going to call and complain and that maybe something else we ate made us sick.  We will not go to this restaurant again and I'd advise other's to think twice about eating here."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the city! $5 for two fish tacos, $5 for a bowl of mussels in a white wine garlic broth, $5 for a Mango Mojito!  I don't know anything about the restaurant end of this place, but I know they have a loyalty rewards program and an amazing happy hour. This is by far the best Happy Hour in the city as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"After posting this review I received an email that they would like more feedback so I went to the link that was in the email, posted the same information and then never heard from them again."}
{"text":"Again, Please Yelp I don't want to leave a star!!!!  My sister was in town for 3 weeks so we thought we would take her for a nice seafood dinner. We had heard that Landry's was a good place with great atmosphere. We entered and were greeted by a very nice young woman that sat us right away.  We were seated and waited about 10 minutes but that was ok since they were so busy. Our server arrived and we ordered our drinks and since we had waited we were also ready to order our food. This seemed to bother our server as I guess we broke her rhythm. I made the mistake of ordering iced tea because I never got a refill until I was almost done with my meal and I had to ask again to even get that because she forgot. The food was so so not really in keeping with all the hype we had gotten about the restaurant. Long John Silver would have been better....no kidding. The fish wasn't blackened like we asked, the shrimp were cut in half to make them look bigger on the plate and my sisters meal was mostly a bunch of fried greasy onion strings again to make the plate look full. Our server brought the check and didn't even ask if we would like dessert. Poor Service means we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Happened upon a Landry's restaurant close to the Las Vegas strip and was major-surprised at the quality of food and service!  Do yourself a favor...  Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.  Unless, of course,you are really hungry ...  Our bartender Krissy was especially helpful in a drink and appetizer selection... Next time you go there , be sure to ask for her!  Lots of restaurants in Las Vegas... Make sure you don't miss this one  Kevin A. Summerlin"}
{"text":"Service was slow and meals were overly priced. Money better spent somewhere else. Waitress was frazzled and spastic. Other staff overheard talking about the waitress's lack of organization. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food and service (our server was a sweetheart). We ordered calamari, lobster bisque, 4 orders of surf n' turf, and a banana foster.   I'm not a big fan of calamari but I'll take my family and boyfriend's word that it was good. I started with the lobster bisque which was good and had chunks of lobster. We also had salad with our meal but I didn't eat mine since I was saving room for the main course and dessert. The filet minion was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the lobster was good too.   We finished with the banana foster which could have been a bit better (the crepe part was probably getting hard due to the ice cream).  I recommend this place if you like seafood."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. Food was cold by the time it arrived. This place used to be good too. Ive never been to a restaurant that was basically empty at 730 pm, and told by the staff  \"its a 45 min wait. were running behind\" Horrible experience."}
{"text":"NEVER NEVER NEVER  AGAIN will i go back to this place Service was slow and mediocre, Our food was not fresh, and was fishy. they served us milky oysters that was for sure going to make us sick if we ate it. Crab tasted frozen an old. Shrimp was overcooked and no flavor, How can you mess up scampi, its butter and garlic, but they did. We paid $80 for two it is not worth it, you might as well go to buffet on the strip for the same price."}
{"text":"Wonderfully affordable for lunch!! Great service and delicious food. Try the Lunchbox with crawfish eoutofee!!! OMG!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3-7! Oysters on the half shell are spectacular! I'm a lover of seafood so naturally I like it when it's served fresh and even better when it's discounted. I've been to dinner here on a few occasions and it gets relatively expensive when ordering drinks and apps. The meal is worth it! My standout favorites are the oysters Rockefeller, the snow crab legs and the lobster tail. The service has always been amazing in the dining room. The service at the bar during happy hour, however, leaves much to be desired. I had to get out of the booth and walk up to the bar to order a drink refill. The patrons on either side of us were complaining of the same."}
{"text":"Food was excellent... Customer service was great until the server opened the check to see what we tipped her.. She looked up with a scowl on her face and shook her head.. Wow! We tipped her 18 percent.. I have never seen anything like this before."}
{"text":"I went to Landry's last Friday with my husband, and we enjoy going to a lot of different restaurants. We were skeptical about Landrys because of the mixed reviews I've read but we were beyond pleasantly surprised. We both had lobster tail and let me say, it was one of the best looking lobster tails I've seen in Vegas. But I like my lobster a little more well done so I asked to have it cooked a little longer. The waitress was very nice, and obliged to my request without hassle. She even sent the manager over, if I remember correctly his name was Rodney. He was extremely nice and friendly, he talked with us for awhile and then came back with my beautifully cooked lobster tail. He seemed sincerely concerned with our experience which was refreshing because a lot of restaurants treat locals like tourists. It seemed busy but the attention from the management and staff was not lacking in the least. My husband and I will definitely be coming back and they even said they'd remember how I liked my lobster cooked. Ha ha"}
{"text":"Just had the best fried calamari of my life at Landrys!  We have been looking for good calamari since moving from CA & now we have a place.  We had fish & chips, very good.  Service was great.  All in all a good place for a lazy Saturday lunch.  Very nice ambiance also."}
{"text":"Vegas weekend with only 2 things on our agenda.  Drink and Eat like GLUTTONS!!  The drinking is a no brainer.. but hmm what to eat??  I suggest the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station.  On our drive over there, my macho man sees the Landry's sign and says he always wanted to try it.  Go for it!! I say and we walk in.  Nice live jazz going on in the bar, so we ask for a booth in there.  Our waitress was actually the bartender and she was super great.  Appetizer - Beef steak tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella -  buffalo mozzerella cheese, balsamic vinegar and purple onion.   This was soo flavorful and the cheese was quality.   Salad - both our dinners came with a garden salad but our waitress was cool and UPGRADED us to a cobb salad for free.  That salad was good and waaaaay too big for both of us to finish.  Seafood Platter ( Hungry One's order) - fresh fish, stuffed shrimp, stuffed crab, shrimp & oysters all fried.  OMG can you say \"Hog Heaven\"?? Wow he ate all of it folks!! I only got to tast a stuffed shrimp but my man said it was ALL good, not greasy or overcooked at all. I was afraid if I reached over I would come up missing a finger or something.  Chilean Sea Bass Madrid (my order) - Parmesan crusted with Mornay sauce w/ pine nuts, artichoke hearts & mushrooms topped with shrimp and scallops. This also came w/ parmesan risotto.  This meal was truly to die for!! I can not say enough about the flavor and the quality of the fish and toppings and that dang risotto rice was heavenly!!  Seriously I don't know if the previous reviews were only for large parties or if there has been a change of management or whatever, but this place is definitely one for good memories, good food and we will return!!!"}
{"text":"I went with friends who had a Landry's VIP card!  The minute we walked in the staff was friendly and accommodating. First let me say that Rosa was one of the best waitress's I've ever had! Five stars to Rosa! She was so friendly and great-I can't wait to go back and see her! My steak was a 4 but all in all a good dinner. Loved the salad and garlic bread, my baked potato was perfect. For once my steak was cooked perfect! it's a chain restaurant  with  typical decor. There's a lot of competition in Vegas so that is hard for a older restaurant to compete. The blackened shrimp was yummy. On Tuesday they have crab all you can eat. We didn't order it but I noticed a lot of people eating it. Ask for ROSA!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour because they have the longest happy hour in town. Drink is good but the food is mostly fried and we all felt a little heavy after all the fried food."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing! Guess I've been spoiled by so many great \"newer\" restaurants in town. This place's been around for awhile and somewhat \"iconic.\" Good location to meet up for a lunch meeting but other than location, it's not a place I'll go for food. Our food lacked freshness and taste overall."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Landys last night for the third time in two months.  Delicious,  for the third time in a row.  We highly suggest one of the Chef Specials (usually in the lower left hand corner of the menu). My wife had the (Chef Special) parmigian encrusted tilapia which includes rice pilaf and asparagus.  Her meal also included salad and dessert and all for only $20.  I had the cedar plank salmon which includes salad and vegetable. Both meals were served with fresh garlic bread and delicious.   Our waiter Dru was fantastic. He provided great guest service as he was attentive to our needs without being overbearing.   Here are a couple tips:  1. Join the Landr's Select Club.  You receive a $25 credit towards your bill after spending $250.  You also receive a bonus $25 credit during your birthday month.  2.  Try their happy hour.  Great food and drink prices in the bar."}
{"text":"Superb service....food was great and our waiter Drew was awesome! The whole staff from the Manager Marisel was the best me and my family will come back!"}
{"text":"We dined here on Valetine's day and it was a busy place. We have always loved the food here and come quite often, usually for a couple happy hour drinks and apps in the bar before going to the dining room.  Since it was Valentines day there was no happy hour so we were able to go right to our table.  Our waitress Marcie was quick to the table to take our drink order.  We ordered teas but then decided to have a bottle of wine instead,  She happily switched out the teas for us.  Soon came that nice garlic butter loaf of hot bread they serve and we love. Our order was taken and the nice large bowl of house salad and dressing was brought.  She topped it with fresh ground black pepper. Our meals came a little quicker than we liked because we had not finished with our salads when our entrees came out.  From here on out while our food was cooked and tasted perfect the service was downhill from there.  Marcie was hard to pin down as she was working 4 or 5 tables and really not able to give the tables the attention needed.  We kept trying to get extra sauces, refilled waters, a fork dropped on the floor and we needed a new one, more of that hot bread and even the bill took for ever.  Yes, it was probably one of the busiest days of the year but she should have been able to handle all the table.  If not for the service I would have rated it 4 stars. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A decent seafood selection with daily filets with good toppings.  Good bar menu.  Service is good.   Nice sides and salads.  Cooks seem to have different talents.  One day the dish is cooked perfectly;  another day the same dish is overcooked.  Good desserts."}
{"text":"Received birthday credit on my Landry Rewards account so off I went.  Had a special Cajun or Southern that included: Grilled Redfish Shrimp Étouffée  Red beans & Andouille sausage Rice pilaf  House salad honey mustard vinaigrette was good  Garlic bread was fresh and soft  Key Lime pie for dessert was a nice finishing touch  Leftovers were tasty for lunch the next day, too"}
{"text":"We love the all you can eat king crab legs on Tuesdays. Service is good. The food is good. I enjoy the quick soup and salad for lunch."}
{"text":"Such a great place for Happy Hour! The decor is beautiful and relaxing. The bar wasn't to crowded and had plenty of Happy Hour appetizers and drink specials to choose from. We ordered the calamari, fish tacos, lobster bisque soup and tempura shrimp. I must say the tempura shrimp was the best! They almost melted in your mouth! The lobster bisque was quite tasty as well. I also ordered a mango mojito(not a fan of mango), but the bartender said I should try it even if I am not a fan of mango. I took his suggestion, and yes, it was very refreshing and the mango flavor was not very strong. All in all, I had a fabulous time and the staff was pleasant and very welcoming. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar service at Happy Hour:  Had the serious displeasure of being waited on by the female bartender (Joanna?). She rarely acknowledged my friend and I, but when she did it was with a very bad attitude. She acted like it was a big inconvenience to wait on people. We would have had several drinks here, but we just couldn't track her down, so we only had two. The appetizers were a big disappointment as well, cold and late.   Long story short: Happy Hour would be a great idea here if it wasn't for such crap service and bad food. Better to leave this place to the Palace Station crowd who are too cheap to hit the strip."}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day. I have to say we were very disappointed this time.  The last time was awesome and we were so impressed with the food quality that I wanted to go back. The one meal came out completely wrong and had no taste to it and had very little seafood in it. The managers response was \"It looks like it wasn't tossed correctly\" That meal was changed totally.  The waitress we had was very friendly and polite the entire time and very apologetic. The manager  knowing it was Mother's day offered a free dessert I guess to make up for the problem.  I guess sometimes it's better to go to someplace you have been to more than once.   (Pictures are from the first trip when we really enjoyed it!)"}
{"text":"There were ups and downs on my last visit to Landry's.  I liked the inside of Crab Stuffed Avocados that were stuffed with crabmeat but not so much the fried golden coating.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder with bacon was thick and creamy.  Garlic Bread was great.  And Red Fish with candied pecans, roasted vegetables, and Lemon Beurre Blanc was moist, tender, and very enjoyable.  But while a Salad Bowl with Homemade Honey Mustard Balsamic Dressing was otherwise excellent, tomato pieces were few.  Diane's Lobster Tail was woefully undercooked, so had to be sent back for more heat.  And she initially received a Baked Potato with sour cream and cheese instead of cheese, butter, and bacon as ordered.     Service was friendly and otherwise efficient.  And I received a free Creme Brulee for my birthday (which I chivalrously turned over to Diane).  Thus, 3-1/2 stars overall on this occasion, which is a 1-1/2 star drop from our last experience here.  Hopefully the kitchen just had an erratic off night."}
{"text":"Well when we returned again and everything change now everythings good perfect almost perfect nothing's perfect in this work but when people trying to do the jobs above and beyond it is hard to be recognized but we should do now they're friendly people at the bar that efficient and professional thanks again most definitely will be going back love the special happy hours now on the weekends all day long"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Ordered off HH menu and regular menu. Very disappointed in the food overall.  We had the oyster Rockefeller, stuffed mushrooms, fried calamari, stuffed shrimp and fried crab balls. Wouldn't recommend any of them. Drinks were okay, service was great."}
{"text":"What would you say about our trip to Landry's? I would say you are slow to be served our drinks. Waters had to be asked for, Bread was promised but had to be asked for. For the price, food was just OK. Dessert was a little better than OK, service leaves a lot to be desired. Would not return, considering the price of The meal, totally not worth it. #NotImpressed"}
{"text":"What a joke. Problem one these people can't seem to add membership points... A different day PROBLEM NUMBER 2 we arrive at the restaurant and are told there is a 10 minute wait I notice there are only 9 tables of people... Hmm whatever.. So we waited, time comes to sit so we sat ...AT THE TABLE FOR  45 MINUTES and NO ONE TOOK OUR order!!!!! When we complained to the manager she didn't seem to care. The staff here looks like trash... Complete trash. They also act like it.  The miniature sized manager was completely useless."}
{"text":"I've been to Landry's about 20 times in the past but have not been here for about three years so I went twice this week. The service is good, the ambiance of the restaurant is excellent. I usually sit at the bar this week I was with two small groups so I ate at the table. Got the crab cake both times. Super. It has changed from what I remember but is still excellent. A little bit more crab meat would be good but I still love it. The salad with house dressing is still as great as it always was. I went on Tuesday April 9th, 2013 the first time. My entree was the halibut which they said just came in. Now halibut was the first dish I ever had here about 10 years ago and it was so good. It was thick and just flaked apart when you touched it with the fork. On this day, it was about half the portion size, tough, and just didn't taste good. What a let down. The rest of the meal was great. I went again on 4/15 and had the crab cake again (super), salad and this time I had the Snapper Hemingway.  Absolutely perfect. I woke up thinking about how good this piece of fish was. Can't wait to go back this summer for more. Its also about 8 bucks cheaper than the halibut. Also the light beers in the tall iced glasses make everything taste better.  Bill first time for 3 people with desserts $190 second time for 2 people no desserts $110.  I guess I should have given 4 stars, but that Halibut was so bad and so expensive"}
{"text":"Great off-the-strip dining, easy parking, and better than good food!  Much respect to Tom, posthumously, who not only wore those cool brim hats while on the sidelines coaching the Cowboys...but sure knew how to carry on after football with some good grub.  I've been a handful of times to this location (ya know, it's a chain right?).  They have a menu of mainly seafood items (hence the name...hello), easy/peasy quick lunches, and near fine-dining as the lights dim in the evening.  If that's not enough, they offer a terrific happy hour with all kinds of specials, and TV's featuring all the sports you can handle.  Service can be a little slow, perhaps it's the staffing levels vs training or caliber.  But, all the servers, managers, and hostesses have been super nice and friendly each time I've gone."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Good wine.  Fried pickles--amazing Shrimp quesadillas--very good  Sat at the bar, wasn't very busy, 2 bartenders. Service was slow and unattentive. No smiles from the female bartenders to make up for it.   Good happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner \"is that all\".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a \"hot\" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says \"oh I forgot to put that in the computer\". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service."}
