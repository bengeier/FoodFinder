{"text":"You don't get better wor won ton than this place.  This is a hidden gem, one of those hole in the wall restaurants that you would never stop at.  Whenever we drive through Calgary we stop here.  Definitely recommend this place and will always come back.  Service is good, food is fast."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. The service is quick and the food is excellent. You can't go wrong with the wor wonton and the rest is good too."}
{"text":"Don't let the shady exterior, or odd location fool you, this place is great. King's, so we were told, was an institution for those ages 40 and up back in the day as the place to go after the bar. It's known for it's wonton soup, but serves breakfast and lunch as well at extremely good prices. I ordered two wholewheat banana pancakes, which came with a choice of 3 strips of bacon/or two sausages, as well as eggs, all for $9.00. Note, the prices on the website haven't been updated in what seems like forever. The pancakes were huge, the sausages average sized - think Stampede bfast like - and the serving of eggs quite substantial as well. I couldn't finish. I tried my friend's wonton soup, which was excellent. The wonton's are HUGE! As well I tried a grilled dumpling. Oh my goodness, thankfully there was only an order of 4, and they weren;t mine. or else I would've eaten them all to myself - and I'm not even a huge fan of Chinese food! The service is great, all the staff help each other out, and are all super friendly in that typical diner way. I'd definitely visit again, and unlike the Edmonton Trail groupings of bfast places, this place was busy, but we had a table within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is famous for wor won ton soup. Place is not fancy and that's ok bc the staff are friendly and the food is very good.   I think 50% of the people come for the soup so if its your first time you must try it.     I think the place been open for 30+ years so that will tell you they for something right.   Lunch will be about $10.  That's a deal in my mind."}
{"text":"I don't think King's warrants all the accolades it's received here. It's pretty well priced for Calgary, yes, but serves only a limited number of Westernized Chinese items and a selection of diner style dishes (pancakes, hamburgers, etc.). The wontons are larger and meatier than elsewhere, but not necessarily better. The dumplings had a rather thick wrapper that was tough to chew.  They serve Seattle's Best Coffee. The service was fast, so if you're in the industrial park and looking for a quick diner bite breakfast or lunch, it'll do."}
{"text":"No question they go heavy on the MSG, you feel sick after. Tasty but gotta say I don't love the quality.  Used to go there but over it."}
{"text":"We had a small issue which was promptly resolved by the manager, and I absolutely love the food here! Customer service is obviously paramount at this Calgary staple restaurant! Try the dumplings ;)"}
{"text":"Best Wor Won Ton in the world. Amazing. Staff knows all the regulars, and makes everyone feel welcome."}
{"text":"Just tried their won ton soup! Was great! and their service is good! They give you the bill right away after the food is served which I found rather unusual. Price is reasonable for its size. Service is quick but not great. Worth the try! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best wonton places ive eaten so far... and im from Vancouver! Customer service was ok, but food was fast and efficient.  I would eat here again fo sho!!! And oh yeah, they sell the same wont tonss at coop"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 30 years, today it took 22 minutes to get my soup and it was salty as hell, Anita, please take the time to taste your broth , the buck stops with you"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. Wor wonton, goooood!"}
{"text":"Very good, satisfying, won ton soup. Excellent fast service, very clean restaurant, and decent pricing."}
{"text":"Oh MAN this is THE best Chinese cuisine in probably all of Alberta.  Their wor wonton soup (I get without noodles) is by far the best I have ever had.  Also the ginger pork with their fried rice is amazing!!  The pork comes fried and the sauce on the side to keep it crispy!!  Service and staff immensely friendly as well.    Can you make a restaurant 100/5 stars??"}
{"text":"Food is gross and truly inedible. All the veggies were either rock hard or over microwaved and completely dried out. \"Seafood\" wor wonton soup came with dyed fake crab legs NOT real crab and under cooked frozen shrimp! Appetizers were horrible, every item we ordered was over salted and you can tell came from the freezer nothing was made in house or fresh... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Kings for lunch and it is true that the waiters, the many people picking up takeout and your fellow diners are an eclectic bunch. Fitting into that group I enjoyed the lunch special of Diet Coke, two dumplings and the usual giant bowl of Wor Won Ton Soup presented with a variety of eating utensils including a Chinese soup spoon, a knife, a regular metal soup spoon and a fork, all of which were used in some measure to devour the warm and steaming bowl of soup.  Did I mention HUGE!   You may be able to find better soup and dumplings but the place is an institution and a unique dining experience.  The service is efficient, the soup is always piping hot and your bill is always delivered with the meal in case you are looking to make a speedy exit.    Five Stars!"}
{"text":"For years I've been told that Kings has the \"Best\" wonton soup there is...so my son and I decided to give it a try last weekend and gave the signature soup a try...All I can say is huh...are you kidding me...OK Ok...it's not bad...but the best? No way!!...you can get better soup at pretty much any Vietnamese hole in the wall in the city...and their spring rolls were just plain bad. The staff we very pleasant and attentive, but the food....while plentiful...was at best marginal..."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast pancakes eggs and bacon! All was good, service was friendly and quick! All for $11.50 with coffee included!  I am pretty picky, but I liked it and was satisfied! They have different specials during the week, pancake one is on Thursday. Coffee is Seattle's best and was good. Will go back"}
{"text":"Consistently good food - particularly their famous Wor Wonton Soup. Large portions, reasonable prices, and as I mentioned - very consistent. You can bank on it being busy during peak hours such as lunch. Come at least fifteen minutes before noon, if not a few minutes earlier, otherwise be prepared to wait.  I have been coming here since the mid 90's and the food hasn't changed at all... Even the other locations."}
{"text":"We recently visited Kings after picking up our parents from the airport.   We ordered a queen and king sized classic wor wonton , spring rolls, and an appetizer platter. Our orders came in quickly. The soup bowls were huge and we shared the soups and everything else. The wontons and broth were suprisingly good, but the noodles were a bit on the soggy side. I wish they had more veggies in the soups as we only got 3 pieces of brocolli and maybe 4 pieces of mushrooms.  Their staff were really helpful and friendly, but the atmosphere of the restaurant is a bit different from the Kings on the Hill. It's a bit old, so it's understandable.  Overall, I would recommend Kings if you're super hungry (and cannot wait) and you would like some wor wonton soup to keep warm on windy winter days."}
{"text":"There is so much I like about Kings: The industrial location, the \"shady exterior\" (complete with a barred door and a chain hanging from it), the team of servers in orange t-shirts (that seem like they belong in a diner moreso than a chinese restaurant), the history of the establishment, the loyal clientele ...  But all this ramped up anticipation makes the final delivery of the food fall slightly flat. It's good! I mean, really, it is! Comforting, fresh, flavourful ... just not GREAT.  I have definitely had better wor wonton (and DEFINITELY had better dumplings!) but it is still a big, filling bowl at a good price, so I would say it is still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love Kings! specially the garlic hot chili oil...yummy. Kristina the owner is super nice and super friendly, she remembers her customers. she upgraded alot of things so the ambiance is a plus. awesome staff....if your in a hurry, and your around the NE, this is a place to be....go early coz its really busy at  lunch time."}
