{"text":"This place rocks. Beautiful decor. Very classy yet fun vybe to the restaurant. Super clean. Great music. The fod was amazing. Peri peri sauce is insane. Service was top notch. I reccomend everyone to check this location out. Priced perfect"}
{"text":"Eating in. Bring a parka. No seriously. This place is freezing. The food mediocre. The service, not so good. Coffee was not even made when we arrived at 6:15 PM. Salt, pepper, sauce.....etc are available at the courtesy area. Are you kidding me. It should be on the tables. They apologized for the service, because it 'got kind of busy'. What!!! Welcome to the restaurant business, you WANT to be busy. Two couples left while we were waiting and they were ordering take out. If there is a way to order ahead of time and pick it up, do that. I sincerely hope the other locations are managed better. My last time visiting this location."}
{"text":"I loved nandos for years then it went down hill for me.  This location has gotten me excited about Nandos again.  Fresh, good seating, nice location and good set up.  The peri peri fries are very good but I just love the chicken with hot sauce."}
{"text":"LOVE the chicken! One of the best I ever tasted. Didn't like the line ups (but you can't do anything about that). I would still go back, that's how good the chicken is."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but the service is absolute shit.  I don't know who manages this place, but it took them 45 minutes to make a chicken wrap and macho peas at 8:16 on a Friday night.  It's a shame the service is so terrible when the chicken is so good!"}
{"text":"The chicken is good and cheap, but the staff is uninterested. Ive always tried to call in advance for pick up and and its always hold and then they eventually hang up."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the colourful atmosphere, friendly staff, comfortable and fun seating, and freestyle Coke machines. 3.5 Stars for the quality of the food. Four of us shared the \"Familia\" meal, and it was the perfect amount of food. The whole chicken was great-juicy and flavourful. The chicken skewers were mediocre- too dry. Ordering is done cafeteria style, so it was nice to just get up and go when we were done our meal. It's an overall fun experience with good food. I would definitely recommend Nando's."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Double Leg with (Seasonal) Corn   Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3 / 5 Cooking speed: 3 / 5 Food Quality: 3.5 / 5 Food Quantity: 2 / 5 Price: 2 / 5  Cleanness: 5 / 5  Repeat: NO  We end up walking away on the first visit because the lineup was too long - You have to lineup to get a seat, then lineup again to order the food again !?  The second visit, we avoid the Fri lunch time and arrive before noon, so we got seated pretty quickly (Although the restaurant was empty, you still need to wait to be seated.....). The Double Leg is pretty tasty, but it is not significantly better than Swiss Chalet. The $3.5 corn was a disaster, it is so tasteless it taste like it was just boiled in water.......  Another time, I tried their chicken wings, it is a very small & thin wing (even with the tip and drum stick attached). It is flavorful but it is not worth $1.5 per wing.....  The place is a better location for a date than Swiss Chalet, but you want to be full, go to Swiss Chalet instead."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Nando's and probably my last.  I didn't realixe it was one of those places where you have to line up and order your food.  If there was a cost savings involved, I could understand it, but the food was pricy for what it was.   The quarter chicken was a leg only, my side was a small bowl of coleslaw.  I added a green tea and the bill with tax was just under $14.  For lunch.  The chicken wasn't very tender'; I had to fight to get the chicken off the bone.  It tasted no better or worse than a half dozen similar places. The coleslaw was okay if you like it creamy - I really don't.  There are many full service restaurants in the neighbourhood with more reasonable prices. I'm glad I tried it, but like I said I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Eh nothing special, pretty much a Swiss chalet. Service is not the best and seems kind of scattered. The fries are terrible, definitely not fresh and no amount of seasoning will fix that.   They can accommodate large groups reasonably well and the prices aren't outrageous but that is about all it has going for it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at two different Nandos outside Central London and at one in Glasgow (Travel name drop? You bet.) Nandos in Calgary is virtually the same delicious peri peri chicken and sides along with other similar UK menu options. The decor of the 32nd Ave NE store matches those of the UK which is an open, casual dining room. There are a couple large tables for whole flocks...groups.  I usually get the extra-hot seaoned half bird, peri fries and caesar salad,  topping the grilled poultry off with a combo of extra hot and garlic sauces provided on the table. There are several levels of heat, so don't worry about burning your gizzard out! This trip (to the NE) saw three of us actually explore the menu a little more thoroughly. We discovered that there are several good platter deals for about the same money as purchasing individual meals. We were peckish, so we went with the Party Pack. For 60 clucks, err, bucks, there was enough to feed 6! Could have brought the hens, but this was a rooster's lunch!  When the food started arriving , we knew we were going to need take-away boxes! The platter of garlic bread alone was huge! 2 whole chickens, fries, rice and caesar salad! All of it was fresh and hot, with the exception of the salad - fresh but not hot (did I really need to explain that?). I like the caesar style here as they don't overload it with dressing.  The staff are plucky and helpful. Let them lead you to a table. Food arrives quickly after ordering at the counter! Servers do check on you and are happy to bring additional drinks or other things you may need to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Good food.  Crap service.   Sat waiting for my take out order for 30 min.  Order was apparently ready for a long time and they had a \"communication breakdown\".  Bravo."}
{"text":"S'good. They got chicken n whatnot. Nah mean?"}
{"text":"First off I have to go wait to be seated, get a menu, get up go to the cash, order and pay. Then get my own drinks but when I'm paying the tip comes up....why? Secondly we order a family meal and it was a little pricey but the worst was the service and portions. Chicken was fine but I've had better. The sides that were large sized...they were small ice cream bowls. One had maybe 15 pieces of vegetables in it and the other had two small scoops of potatoes. Had to order a small salad and fries and those portions arrived in the same sized bowl that the large was in and same size! Let's put it this way...I inquired and someone came over and offered after seeing I was annoyed to give me more potatoes but the way he handled it and his approach made me not even want them. I just wanted to get out of this place and if I didn't have my family with me I would've left without eating. Over priced cafeteria that sucks"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chicken skewers and they were great! Tender. Nicely grilled. Good taste. Service was very friendly and fairly fast during a busy time of day (around 5 pm). I will go back."}
{"text":"A whole lot of hype with no substance. My significant other and I went here with a friend who had raved about this place. I've been eating Portuguese chicken my whole life, way before it was trendy (thanks Mom).   Walking into Nando's, you feel like you're in somewhat of a circus. The decor is vibrant and there's a lot going on. They don't serve you at the table. You have to go up to the counter to order. But then they serve you at the table. But you need to get your own cutlery, condiments, and drinks. I've done less running around at my cross-fit class. And the attitude here is somewhat snobby and evident that someones putting the 'fear of God' in the staff.  My chicken arrives and it's not what I expected. It's pale and just cooked. In fact, it's still pink at the center. The best part about real Portuguese chicken is the crispy skin! Look elsewhere- you won't find it here. The sides are simply okay. The hot sauce is delicious though and I regularly buy it at Loblaws for home use.  They've got custard tarts on the menu (pasteis de natas) and I order one, hoping it will make up for the lousy dinner. Well, that was the saddest looking nata I have ever seen in my life! Pale, small, no burnt top. No sooner was the tart in front of me, than I was sending it back. Well, I tried to. Our server was keen on arguing with me, telling me that if she sent the tart back, it would be waste. I remind her that I hadn't touched it, and I quickly pull up a picture on my iPhone of a proper Portuguese custard tart. She tells me in no less terms that she doesn't care and takes the tart away. Definitely an experience!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out NANDOS . I was quite the pleasant experience. The chicken was juicy and tender with the unique peri peri sauce . I would come back just for the sauce ! Though it was on the pricey side but it was well worth it ! Great food and staff"}
{"text":"This is  my second time here and I was just as satisfied as the first.  I had the Peri Peri chicken, garlic bread and the chicken liver.  The meat was tender and juicy but it was a little too charred for my liking this time. Chicken liver was very rich in texture but a little to salty.  Decor was very pretty and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Three words, expensive, expensive, expensive as hell. I paid almost $40.00 for 2 people to eat.  Food was adequate."}
{"text":"Went today with my boyfriend as we were trying to look for something a little healthier than the usual fast food options. It was my first time there but the cashier was very helpful whenever we asked questions. We settled on sharing 10 of the grilled wings with a side of corn and rice which all came to about $21. Food was very tasty and I really liked how you get the whole wing and not just the little halves. Also really enjoyed that our corn was still on the cob. I was very full after, even though we shared. The girl (different from the cashier) who brought our food said she'd return with our waters in a moment, but never came back. And you NEED water when you're having spicy food ! I had to go the counter and ask and said it slipped her mind, but there was no one else in the restaurant ... It happens. But still. Anyways. Good portions for a reasonable price for 2 people eating food that doesn't taste processed"}
{"text":"This place was great! The chicken was perfectly cooked and a great price. I had the herb and lemon flavour since I'm not a fan of spicy. The garlic mashed potatoes and special fries were perfect sides. The added bonus was the amazing pop fountain. I recommend the raspberry coca-cola! The service was fast and interesting way of taking your order. Only downside was that their frozen yoghurt machine has been broken for quite some time and I was bummed I couldn't get any since it was bottomless!!"}
{"text":"The chicken tastes good.  However the portion sizes are small.  If you're hungry be prepared to pay a lot.  We ordered the orange juice for my nephew and it was separated and watery.  They showed me the plastic bottle it came from and there was no expiry date. Just \"expires in 1 week\" printed on it.  We ordered the kids skewer meal.  The meal comes with literally just one skewer (Wolfed down by a tiny 7 yr old in 1 minute) and a very small side on a huge empty plate.  We had to order a double portion to satisfy them.  All in all it was almost $100 to feed 4 kids and 2 adults a simple, unfilling lunch. I should have gotten the family meal, perhaps that would have been more filling.  Wonder if their chickens are any more special than swiss chalet chickens.  If you compare the size of their meals, swiss chalet ' s gives 3 or 4 times more food. On the good side:   they substituted a slice of cheese cake for the chocolate frozen yogurt bc my nephew can't eat chocolate. Also the servers were very polite. Was it worth it?  Nah, I left still hungry."}
{"text":"I love chicken, and I love Nando's.  I remember seeing them in Vancouver in a food court (just like I've seen Swiss Chalets in some food courts), and I'm happy that they have an outlet here in Calgary.  Flame grilled chicken tastes wonderful if done right, and the various marinades and peri-peri sauces they use here really add some kick to the chicken, and not in a spicy way if that's what you want.  You pay at the till and they bring you your food to your table when it's ready if you're dining in.  If you go for the fountain pop, you can get free refills.  They also do take-out, if you're pressed for time and can only drop in for a moment.  A single meal can be somewhat expensive (depending on what your definition of 'expensive' is), but it's really great for groups where you can get a bunch of different items and sides and share.  You can experience more variety that way too while splitting the costs.  The chicken is so tender, juicy, and delicious that I always try to find an excuse to go back.  If you like chicken, you should definitely check this place out.  29/30"}
{"text":"We find this place is very good for take-outs. Their dining room is pretty simple and I found their food tastes much better at home, as it is made for eating at home. I like their grilled chicken with lemon herb flavour. It's spicy enough but doesn't kill the taste. We usually go for their familia combo plus add some extra salads or rice and dinner for 6 is ready.   I've seen their kitchen and it's very clean, which gives me great confidence in their food. I definitely recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"Where's all my chicken lovers at? If you LOVE chicken then you'll absolutely will LOVE Nando's.  Located along 32nd Street close to Sunridge Nissan and just minutes away from Sunridge Mall, you can't miss it!   The reason why Nando's deserve 5 stars all around is because they have efficient service, great customer service, great parking, quality of food, and the plating is superb.  If you haven't been to Nando's then I'll break it down for you, if not feel free to skip this part and read the next paragraph below! Basically how Nando's work is that you'll get seated at a table with a number don't forget that number because you'll need it when ordering your food. Upon receiving their menu there's a lot of choices to choose from for chicken: double leg, skewers, 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, and whole. Feeling like you want more for yourself? They do have entree size with suggestive servings per person. They also have a variety of sides with two sizes, normal or Nando's size for $3 more. The plating between the two size does make a difference fyi. Once you've chosen what you want and how \"hot\" you want your chicken just head to the front counter and tell the cashier what you want and your table number, then from there you can grab your drinks, sauces, and cutlery and wait back at your table.  Pro tip: just ask for water and you can choose to get pop instead since you fill it up on your own plus it's bottomless. Saving yourself from that $2.75!  My girlfriend, brother and I ordered three separated dishes. The wait time wasn't that long it came in a timely matter. The food was great! Chicken was juicy, marinated and grilled to perfection and the plating was astonishing. I ordered the classic combo which consists of a whole chicken, a Nando's side and a choice of Portuguese buns or garlic bread - suggestive for two people but hey I can devour that on my own (I was a little bit hungry before hand to be honest), my brother ordered a half chicken with two separated sauces and a size of mash, while my girlfriend order a quarter chicken with Peri Peri fries. We had three different sauces for each plate, lemon & herb, hot, and extra hot. To me the hot and extra hot is the same and to be honest it's not actually hot at all.  Overall satisfied with our visit and I would strongly recommend Nando's to anyone who wants to try something new and to those chicken lovers out there. Definitely would come back again soon."}
{"text":"Nandos is very average grilled chicken. The sauces are what make the chicken interesting. I always get it hot and add some extra hot sauce to make it more interesting. I got a half chicken and 1 regular side for $17. It's pretty expensive for what you get. The chicken pieces were small and I was still hungry at the end. I got a side of spicy rice which was a tiny bowl spiced rice that tasted awful. I was hungry after I ate my chicken but couldn't finish the rice just because it was so bad.  Also, this isn't a fancy sit down place even though the decor is good. You order and are asked to pay (and leave a tip before you server serves you) before the food finally arrives at your table. I probably won't be going back and paying $17 for that. I would rather buy lots of chicken from the supermarket, grill it and add the nandos sauce you can buy at the supermarket."}
{"text":"When I visit the UK I pop into Nando's regularly and love it every time no matter what location I'm at. So I was very excited to try this location in Toronto, unfortunately it wasn't the same experience.    I ordered half a chicken with a side of regular fries and when it arrived it didn't look at all appetizing, the fries were bland and soggy and the chicken was just OK once I smothered it in hot sauce.  It's disappointing as the decor is lovely and the seating is perfect for large or small groups and the staff are friendly but I am really sad to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I always go there and the service is pretty good. I love their sauces and the food is amazing. Tonight we went and I received my chicken not well cooked. I have returned it back for them to make it well done and they did it. Please cook your chicken well."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, my wife suffers from low blood pressure and we asked for a table that was not directly under the A/C, we were given attitude by the staff. We will never come back here and I suggest going elsewhere to spend your money. Cashier is a little bitch."}
{"text":"Nando's is one of my favorite restaurants and this location is absolutely amazing. The service is great and quick and the seating is nice. The food, oh my goodness, the food. Whatever is in that peri peri sauce is magical because it tastes absolutely delicious! Their chicken sandwich is perfect if you're eating alone but if you have at least 4 people with you your best option is their party pack. You can choose the amount of heat you prefer and if there's still not enough flavor their array of sauces to choose from will definitely please your taste buds. Nando's is the perfect place to go with your friends or family to have a good meal and a good time"}
{"text":"Great food but very bad service. The staff is very disorganized. We only ordered for take out but as we were standing there to wait for our order, we noticed that there were at least 5 people who came up with their receipts to complain about something. It seems like everyone didn't know what they were doing next and there was no work flow. I've tried Nando's in other countries and this location was such a huge disappointment. I'm never coming back to this restaurant again even if this is the only Nando's in Calgary."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick bite. Very disappointed. Small overpriced portions. The grill, or, utensils need cleaning. I was seriously ill about 30 minutes after I ate there.   I was fine, immediately after I purged.   Strongly DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I tried Nando's for the first time last week. For what it's meant to be... a swiss-chalet-type portugese-style grilled chicken restaurant, I was quite impressed. The restaurant was clean and comtemporary. The service was excellent and actually well beyond my expectations.  My friend and I shared the variety pack which consisted of 1/2 chicken, 2 kebabs and 8 wings. The roast chicken was succulent and most impressive of all. It was tender and juicy! While it was as spicy as I had expected (we ordered medium), I quite enjoyed it with the garlic peri peri sauce. I found the hot peri peri sauce to be just ok.. not as flavourful as the garlic peri peri.  Back to the food... the kebabs were ok.. they weren't too dry but I much prefer the chicken pieces. The wings were decent as well. The peri peri fries were fresh and crispy. The coleslaw was ok. While the sides were just average, it was the roast chicken pieces that made the meal memorable. I'd definitely go back to Nando's over Swiss Chalet any day.  And the other nice thing is that they are licensed so you can have a beer or glass of wine with your meal."}
{"text":"Nando's was highly recommended to me, so of course I tried it out with my husband on a date night. Overall - We were both very confused by the higher end decor but the fast food ordering style.  Ok, whatever.  The fries were delicious.  The rest...meh.  We got the shared variety plate and honestly, I was not at all impressed by the chicken.  That's all fine, maybe it's just not my cup of tea.  However, I found a peanut in my glass of coke, my fork was dirty, and I found an eyelash in my fries, a hair in our chicken, and another hair in the chicken they brought us to replace the first chicken (definitely not our hairs, as we are both light-haired and these hairs were black).  I really wanted to like Nando's as much as everyone who has told me about it, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends after a good gym session. We ordered two chickens and a large garlic mashed potato side. The spicy chicken was good but the mild chicken was mediocre so we had to add a lot of sauce. Service was slow. They didn't bother to give us plates and utensils so we got our own after 5 minutes because we were very hungry at that point.  We got complimentary drinks from the cashier which is pretty nice.  Not somewhere I would make a trip for."}
{"text":"I have been to Nando's a few times for their famous peri-peri chicken  mostly because I live close by. What it really is, is just some peri chilli sauce smothered onto  BBQ grilled chicken. The sauce is really the highlight.  While I do agree, sometimes the chicken can get dry, their side dishes are really what makes it a great meal. The peri fries is a must have for first-timer, and it has just the right amount of spices to it.  The peri rice is also good alternative, and compliments the dish well.  I usually get the fiesta meal which comes with lettuce, sour cream, salsa and rice with skewer chicken. Not bad for a quick meal.  The only drawback would be the price. A meal for 2 will run you over 20 dollars with drinks.  The restaurant runs like a fast food joint - you'll have to order at the counter and they bring it to your table, but prices don't reflect that.  Seating is generally comfortable and servers generally greet with a smile.  It's A-OK and worth to try at least once. If you like, get their bottle of marinated sauces for those summer BBQs days and make your own Peri peri chicken!"}
{"text":"Nandos is super popular in England (used to live there; there are 300 Nandos in England therefore its an official epidemic). Nandos is mostly self-serve but the waiters bring your food, so its no big deal.   The new style is eclectic- showing design inspired from their main headquarters in South Africa mixed with bright colours and patterns. In comparison to England, the place is much more fun and lively while in England, the style is more laid back. I honestly loved how bright and airy it was on a cold February day in Toronto.   Massive amount of seating, and there is a private room in the back. It wasn't busy but it definitely has the capability to be packed.   I ordered the  \"veggie sandwich\"; two sides of \"spiced\" rice (forever called \"spicy rice\" in my heart) and grilled corn on the cob and bottomless coke for a total of  $15. The veggie sandwich is different than the standard soy burger you get in Toronto and it was delicious. My favorite part was this location has the most amazing range of drinks. I was freaking out to see coke cherry; coke lemon; coke lime and coke vanilla. The food tasted just as good as always and I am very happy to see a central location for Nandos in Toronto (finally!)   See photos at: http://atoronto.blogspot.com/2014/02/nandos-bay-street-to.html"}
{"text":"This is our second time here, great service ,clean food, beautiful decoration; i feel it reflects South African style. we had half a chicken with 2 sides: corn and wedges.The second order was chicken skewers with spicy rice,it was good but small! along with coleslaw. You can choose how spicy your chicken can be.  If you like grilled chicken this is the place to be."}
{"text":"One of the better roasted chicken restaurants in Calgary, not that there is a whole lot of competition.  If you're asked to go to a chicken restaurant chain named after a Swiss house style, suggest Nando's instead.  The chicken is tender, but the marinade is not quite as flavorful as you might think.  This is where the selection of sauces on the table help, from lemony and herbaceous through to super hot.  A variety of healthy side dishes are available if you don't feel like fries. The only thing that stands out negatively is the Portuguese bun, with its unappealing dry texture and crust.  Three stars because I'd rather go to Joey's and order the outstanding half chicken for only slightly more money, or save some coin and pickup up a delicious hot chicken from Costco and eat at home."}
{"text":"This place has great chicken with just the right amount of spices and peri peri sauce. Much better than swiss chalet although much more expensive.   Family meal doesnt save you any money vs individual meals tbh.   Great selection of wedge fries, peri fries and other sides.   Would come here again."}
{"text":"Nando's Chicken is definitely the king of succulent, tender and juicy chicken. A healthy option for lunch or dinner. Seating does get full during lunch hours. Price wise, good quality and portions for what you pay for.   Thx for coming to Canada!"}
{"text":"Caveat: Nigerians have a thing for Nando's! I've eaten in Nando's on 3 different continents so this review unfortunately compares the Calgary Nando's to my previous experiences.  Came to Nando's for lunch with the sis visiting from Houston. Snagged the last parking spot by the door and went in. Straight up, I liked the decor and we were greeted warmly. Grabbed seats in a booth and I ordered a Caesar salad with medium spicy chicken. Sis ordered the 1/4 chicken with spicy rice.  We both rolled our eyes when we had the chicken. Nice but not spicy by any stretch of imagination. I took off one star for the wimpy-level spicy but gotta add one star for the little touches in the decor and one more for staff attitude."}
{"text":"I ordered the herbal non spicy chicken leg with peas and salad. Chicken is very YUMMY, side dishes are satisdactory as well. My husband ordered the spicy chicken, slightly over burned. Service is pleasant"}
{"text":"The food was not that good, but the service was great.  I had the plain grilled chicken leg with 3 sides; spiced rice, fries, and peri-peri vegetables. The chicken was ok, I had much better though. The peri-peri vegetables were ok also. The rice was very very bad that I couldn't eat it. I really hated it. The fries was below average.  The place itself was nice. lovely decor!"}
{"text":"++ Halal chicken + Spacious + Beautiful decoration + Service is faster than some other Nandos that I have been to"}
{"text":"I love Nando's . The chicken is juicy, everything is spicy, the side plates are delicious and the prices are reasonable. I ordered a half chicken with salad and rice and covered everything with their garlic sauce. The selection of sauces is excellent, they have a very unique peri-peri taste. Definitely worth checking out for fans of carribean, Mediterranean and other regions of the world that employ alot of spices. Beware of the extra-hot sauce!"}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time last week, but surely will return.  The chicken was delicious!  You order at the counter, but they serve you at your table.  The portions were relatively small so order generously.  The staff was friendly and helpful and service was pretty quick.  I also liked that they played Portuguese music.  It's not the kind of place where you sit for fine dining -- it's fast food, but really tasty.  If you like spicy food, their peri-peri sauce is up your alley, but if you don't, you can get lemon and herb."}
{"text":"I tried it because i was craving portuguese style chicken and read the reviews. Thought id try it myself. I feel like the chicken they give u is too skinny. The flavour is good but not enough meat. Its great for someone who eats a little bit and eats lights. However it felt too expensive for the price. 2 drinks one chicke  with two sides and another chicken combo with one side came up to 30bucks!! I felt like. Wow.. really 15 bucks for this tiny bit of chicken? Althought u dont get alot i would still go cause the flavour was good and if i dont wanna go all the way to maple to get  delicious pollio loco. Anywas thats my opinion. It was good. But they were just stingy on the portions. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Every time I get food here (usually about once a week), it's always the Fiesta Meal. Chicken breast, rice, salad (chopped Romaine lettuce and diced tomatoes) and it comes with a light spring dressing and sour cream for the chicken and rice. I usually get the spice level hot but G prefers his a combination of medium/hot. Like one reviewer mentioned, it does continue to burn after. :)  It's kind of interesting to note that they get you to pay for the meal before you sit down with your number at a table and there's an option to tip on the machine (if you're paying by any kind of card). Not quite sure why they have it set up this way... how do I know what I'm going to tip if they haven't served me the food yet??   All of that being said, their service is decent so I don't have issues leaving a pre-tip. (Oh, but on that note, why the heck is tip calculated as a percentage of the meal??? In my books, service is service, regardless of how expensive the meal is. I wish the practice of tipping with set dollar amounts would take hold vs a percentage of the meal. Would you tip a valet more or less depending on the venue or the cost of your meal? Ridiculous.)  But I digress, the food at Nando's is good, the dining experience: casual and the spice levels: hot, hot, hot!"}
{"text":"Chicken is pretty good but service is poor and check your take out before you leave because they messed up my order 3 out of 5 times before I stopped buying from them."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm not a big fan.  Pros: - decent chicken - good selection of sauces to choose from and combine  Cons: - long wait times for lunch - small portions - the menu could be bigger"}
{"text":"Not my kind of place...having to pay up front before one experiences the no-service policy...carrying ones glass of wine & water to the assigned table....having to pick up napkin,cutlery & ketchup en-route...noise level (not a place for a meal & conversation) spicy fries (regular ones with a spice powder sprinkled on top as an after thought) Chicken was fine...but back to Swiss Chalet (while not perfect) when next I am looking for this type of chicken-fix"}
{"text":"Nando's can't decide what it wants to be. Part cafeteria, part fast food, part sit-down restaurant, Nando's offers cafeteria-quality food at restaurant prices served in a fast-food atmosphere. The service was quite poor - parts of our order were forgotten, and we had to ask not once but twice to get it. Since they have no servers (remember, it is only part-restaurant) we had to get up ourselves each time. But since everything is in the back (remember, it is part-restaurant) we couldn't get it ourselves - we were told to sit down and wait.   The portions were small, especially for restaurant prices. They charge $6.50 for a \"large\" plate of French Fries - they don't stack them on the plate, so it's a flat plate of cheap McCain fries (or similar) for that price. They could at least serve fries made in-house.   The chicken is fine, competently cooked, but at $17 for a whole chicken I expect more than that. The wraps and sandwiches are $6-7 for a small piece of chicken. There is nothing special - they take some lettuce and sauce, add a small bit of chicken and slap it in a wrap/bun.   Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. It reminded me of my high school cafeteria, but it cost 2x as much."}
{"text":"I'm a ducky straight out of South Africa, and breast fed on Nandos! Ive tried this place twice, yup the taste is pretty much the same but, i cant get over how small and shrunken the portions are. I have never seen chicken in T.O which was so itsy bitsy. The chicken is packed with flavour but is so disappointing seeing such anorexic portions. I over heard a customer in the washroom complaining that she had to send her portion of fries back- 10 fries doesn't cut a portion!  They could do so much better."}
{"text":"Really liked the decor and the seating, quite inspirational.   Service was anything but - me and 3 others got seated and were informed of how it all works, but we never heard from that server again. After we received our food from a different server, we wanted to refill our water, but none of the servers came by our way. One did walk by, but when we directed \"excuse me\" to her, she pointedly ignored us and continued walking away. It took us 10 minutes to get some water (and it was a really hot day, so you can't blame us).   Food wise, I got the chicken liver, while the others got the chicken breast and chicken sandwich. It was good but not mind-blowingly amazing. I've had better chicken. I liked the peri peri (sp?) system, and the rice and fries were well done."}
{"text":"They can do better than this. Nandos is known for good grilled chicken around the world. Not at this location. Do better"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service! Always a fun evening here."}
{"text":"Nando's is pretty popular in Australia, which is why I got so excited to find there's one in Toronto. Sadly the two things I love most about the Aussie Nando's don't seem to exist in it's Canadian counterpart - the BBQ chicken ribs, and the chicken seasoning on the fries.  The prices here are more expensive than in Australia, which I can't really justify.  I was a bit disappointed for the above reasons. My partner loved the whole meal though, and wouldn't blink at the expense to go again."}
{"text":"I love the Nando's in London so when it came to Toronto I was super excited.   The sauce or is it the chicken tastes different ?! The vegetables feel a little too greasy. The fries not enough of the dry rub spice. Mashed potatoes are super garlic.  The caesar chicken sandwich is definitely one of my favorites.. a great balance of spicy and tangy. Also love that they give you extra sauces to try out when you order take away.   They ask you to tip before even providing any service. If I had known they were going to take 45min to serve lukewarm food I definitely would have not tipped.   Nando's on Bay needs to step it up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Its an nice place to go to in general. It's like a fast food place with the premium environment of a restaurant, which is pretty cool. The noise level seemed to be low which is also a good perk. I go there occasionally, like after exams, usually with my schoolmates.   The food: Simply amazing.  One of the best grilled chicken my taste-buds ever tasted. I usually order a half-chicken plate with fries and drink. Everything starting from the texture of the meat to the flavor is excellent. The food is prepared fresh so the meat is quite tender and juicy. One of the most noteworthy things about the restaurant is the delicious sauce. The fries are also very good and the spices that are sprinkled on to them make them even better. If you like fries, you'll love nando's fries. However before you go to nando's, make sure that you like spicy food, because that's what makes it so great ! When I order my meal, I usually go for hot in the peri-peri scale. The 'hot' option is spicy enough to for you to feel the heat but yet preserve the tasty. The extra hot is just too spicy and even a spice lover like me won't like it as much. It gets to the point where it's just too hot and ruins the taste somewhat. If you are a moderate spice lover, well, i recommend medium for you. You can still go if you can't stand spicy food and get the 'lemon and herb' option.  I found the service to be average. Nothing special about that...  The only downside to Nando's is that it is a little overpriced. If you want a good meal, you will probably end up using about $20 or more. But trust me, the price is worth it once in a while. Although the franchise is not as prominent in Canada as in other countries like the U.A.E, I would definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant may be part of the same chain as the one in the UK.  this place has awesome chicken.   give the hot sauce a try but beware, it continues to burn!"}
{"text":"I was familiar with Nando's as a very popular fast-food joint (that seeks to operate like a restaurant) in Malaysia and Dubai. I find that in in Calgary their menu is limited and they don't have a wide variety of sauces.   The last time I went to Nando's I noticed most of the old seats were ripped or had huge holes in them... Also it was quite noisy, I could hear kids crying both to my left and right! Then I noticed dust in the air (which made my friend go aachooo!) and when I saw staff sweeping the floor I had to cover my drink with a napkin and was glad our food hadn't arrived yet!   The portions are smaller but the quality of food is good...  I tried their rice once and it was undercooked, I never risked it again. You can't go wrong with the peri fries and the staff have not disappointed so far!"}
{"text":"Not at the same level as the Nando's restaurant sin the UK. The portions are smaller the menu selection has less variety. overpriced for what you get. the flavor of the food is good."}
{"text":"Best chicken place in Toronto for sure! The restaurant has a very warm and cozy atmosphere and is a perfect place for a first date!  The table service is very minimum. You order at the cash with your table number and someone will bring your food to your table. While you wait, you will have to grab your own cutlery and sauces. Their grilled chicken is absolutely amazing! Juicy and tender! (Even the chicken breast) The rice is well seasoned and cooked. I would personally advise not ordering the mashed potatoes as they have a tangy sour taste to them.  Overall the food and service was exceptional and the restaurant is definitely in my top 2 best chicken places in Toronto =)"}
{"text":"I have been a Nando's customer at Richmond-hill location  and other locations around Ontario and the world for more than 5 years. We received a terrible service today from a server wearing a red shirt at the cash register. From the moment we walked in and started placing our order, she badvibed us and illustrated a very negative attitude and rudeness towards us. They also ran out of plastic cutlery and I was told that our server would be bringing them to our table. Unfortunately the same lady at the cash brought us our food and failed to bring us cutlery. When I asked for it, she rudely told us \"to get it yourself\" I understand that she might have had a difficult day but she shouldn't have put it on us! She also didn't properly apologize for her terrible behavior.  I probably won't go back:("}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our food, the free wifi wasn't working, they ran out of the desserts I wanted, and the fro-yo machine was busted for a bit. All of that being said, I still officially love this place. I've been to Nando's in Vancouver, but never to one out east. It's also been a few years since I've had Nando's chicken in general. First off, it's gorgeous inside. I've been waiting for this location to open for months now. For the longest time all I saw was construction equipment and loose wires inside whenever I walked by. Walking was like WOW. Secondly, this is already a really popular spot. It was packed inside and the line up almost went out the door for ordering. Luckily dining in wasn't full, so I got a table with my friends right away.  When we went up to order we were told that it would be an hour wait for our food. If this were any other establishment I would've been pissed, but I've been craving Nando's for a while. Sadly the free wifi wasn't working, which isn't really a big deal since not all restaurants have it anyway. It just would've made the wait time go by much faster is all. Food: awesome, juicy chicken. Just the way I remember it. Decent sized portions for a great price. They also added new items to the menu since I've been, including desserts. I was upset that they ran out of both cheesecake and chocolate cake (my 2 faves), but I tried the carrot cake and it was fantastic. I don't normally like carrot cake, but this one wasn't too sweet. It might be one of the best carrot cakes I've ever had. Lastly, they have bottomless pop and juice. There's a machine with a touch screen that allows you to choose from over 100 drinks. It's just a $2.49 flat rate and you can have as much as you want. Same goes with the fro-yo machine. $3.99 flat rate and take as much as you want."}
{"text":"I have always loved Nando's. But I am very disappointed from last nights experience at this location. I ordered a quarter chicken meal (leg and thigh), spicy level hot, a little before 10 pm. The chicken was not flavourful at all. In fact, the meat was hard and somewhat chewy!! It tasted like fake chicken. And the potato wedges also did not have enough peri peri flavouring as it usually does. I think I was served old chicken and wedges! This location is open till 11pm and I don't understand why I'm getting old food at 10pm.  I'm extremely disappointed and may not return to this location for takeout."}
{"text":"chicken was juicy and the flavour on the exterior of the chicken was quite good. I ordered 2 large sides to share amongst 2 people in total. we got the potato wedges and a house salad. the salad contained a variety of spring mix, romaine, cucumbers and baby tomatoes. the quality of the salad was fresh and crisp. the array of sauces to use on our chicken, salad, etc was excellent, as there were a variety, ranging from mild, to extra hot.  potato wedges were delicious. overall a great lunch, and you get a great portion for the price!"}
{"text":"Good food, but you just don't feel like you're getting value.  $11 bucks for a grilled half-chicken and a side?  I'd rather spend 8 bucks for the half, and leave the side as an option. That being said, their sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"The positives;  Chicken was tasty,  Restaurant is nice  The negatives;  Half of the staff act like they have been sentenced to community service in nandos! One or two really enthusiastic people around but most of them seemed fed up being there. Pretty sure the girl at the cash was trying to impale her pen in the touch screen every time she prodded it   Portions are tiny! Unless you are a small young rabbit avoid the regular size Caesar salad. My gf ordered this & I'm not lying when I say you'd probably get more salad on a Big Mac!!  My fries were cold. I brought then up to the desk & they replaced them with marginally warmer ones at which point I just ate them.   All in all I probably wont go back but I must admit the chicken was good albeit a smallish portion."}
{"text":"Long time did I not have such juicy chicken when not at home.  This Portuguese chicken is good with the peri-peri hot sauce but I can only take mild and it's still good.  The price is a bit expensive.  You basically order your dishes and find a table to sit down.  The dishes will be served to you by the waitress.  The staff is polite.  The cole slaw is creamy and is good.  We also buy a Portuguese custard tart.  The custard texture is good except the crust is not crispy anymore.  I tried the same tart in Macau (previously governed by Portugal) that is so much better."}
{"text":"Looks great, but doesn't match the expectation in the food. This is a place for families or rowdy groups, not for a significant get together."}
{"text":"The chicken was good.  I found the garlic peri peri sauce hotter than the hot sauce.  Decent sized portion of potato wedges which looked disproportionate to the garlic mashed.  Both were satisfactory.  Didn't think a full plate would be enough for 3 big eaters but the huge plate of potato wedges filled us up.  Was disappointed with the garlic bread more like garlic hamburger bun.  I thought it was pricey in comparison for the amount of chicken.  The dining room is way too packed.  Aisle ways are too narrow and so are the booths.  Place is noisy with all the hard surfaces.  The food was decent but I wouldn't go back just for the uncomfortableness of the seating."}
{"text":"Nando's is always a great choice for a delicious meal! My first experience(s) were when I was living in the UK and since this location has opened I've come on a somewhat regular basis. We often opt-in to their share platters that include chicken, a side or two and Portuguese buns and/or garlic bread. We never leave feeling unfulfilled and often have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the one at Eglington. Here they seem to be more about the decor than the food. The decor being somewhat of a confused fusion between different cultures. The first time I went here the waitress brought the wrong order, oh and brought the wrong order for my girlfriend as well. The second time I visited this place I had the chicken peri peri burger or some variation of that. It was interesting as I got to learn what a rock in a bun tastes like. It seemed like the chicken in that bun was the most abused and battered chicken that ever lived. Travel the distance and go to the one at eglington, they too are slow and careless but their chicken is good."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to stop and Try out Nandos this evening and we got seated and before my Mom or me had a chance to order we started coughing because of the extreme amount of smoke that was in the building by the time we went to order the smoke was overwhelming and we had to walk out my Mom is still coughing we are now taking her to the hospital. I don't recommend anyone go to this place. I'm for sure going to report this to the authorities."}
{"text":"This is more or less a self served restaurant.  You order at the cashier and you get your own drinks at this Coke machine which offers like hundreds of choices.  The chicken was really nice and tender, I had it with the medium hot sauce and it was perfect.  You get a choice of sides and I got the spiced rice, very good as well. The reason it gets the 4 star and not 5 is because I found that the dark meat is a little too tender and not as lean as I would like.  I prefer the dark meat at places like Swiss Chalet.  This is a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I got attract but the decoration and tried this franchise for the first time.  The decor is colorful and cozy but the foods is just ok. I ordered 1/4  chicken breast with fries.  The chicken was juicy and delicious.  My meal cost me around 18$.  It is pricy for a piece of chicken and fries."}
{"text":"Spacious place with nice decor. That's all I can say positive.   Very disappointed with the food. A grilled chicken from Sobeys  tastes better than this place's specialty.   Coleslaw didn't taste any better either.    Perrier was good ;).   I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends. In fact I am still upset with my friend who brought me there."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I purchased a Groupon voucher months ago and was not able to use it here. The cashier had no idea about it so the manager was consulted, the manager refused to accept it. Consulted with Groupon who advise the voucher was issues by head office so it is acceptable at all locations. Sounds to me the manager was being a douche.   Food here is mediocre, I've had better tasting chicken at their Woodbridge and Richmond Hill locations."}
{"text":"I like the food on this place. Decent price yet they have a very unusual service. Quite frankly, felt entirely like a fast food chain every thing is self serve.  Once they hand you your food over,  you pretty much have to take care of your self.    The food is nothing special. Their sauce makes a difference and they have lots of variety. Well not that much but you can pick which sauce you want and have as much as you want.   After all that; once you're done, you have the option to leave things and they'll clean it up for you but if you have left overs and wanted to take it home, you can pack it up yourself.   I love chicken but way to ruin a great meal because you don't have the service you're looking for at a restaurant. Also, you have to pay your TIP up front when you order at the counter instead of the usual waiters taking your orders.   I think the customers here deserve the TIPs for serving themselves."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff. Great vegan options, staff was super helpful/accompdatibEverything was very tasty. Quick service. Clean space. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after watching a basketball game. Since we didn't pay for overpriced arena food, we were starving. There wasn't many people when we entered, yet it took 5 minutes just to take our order. We just awkwardly hovered over the front desk waiting to order. When we got our food, I was starving so unfortunately I wasn't looking too closely at what I was eating. The chicken was undercooked and caused me to experience significant stomach indigestion (I am writing this in pain). Not coming back, didn't know there was such a thing as medium rare chicken."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a professional establishment, the staff and service is sub par. Either they're poorly understaffed and too many duties on everyone's plate OR the staff isn't properly trained. I'm stuck using this place when I crave Nandos Bc it's the closest - but I have yet to encounter an establishment with such poor etiquette. I've been randomly hung up on, they get rude, or just plain don't provide satisfactory service.   I can't believe they screwed up an order and told me one thing on the phone and another to my husband in person. They made him pay extra, when they were really supposed to refund money. I'm not going to go all the way back over 5 bucks, but i will take the time to write a review.   This location and it's management needs to really get it together and give people consistent service. Even the food quality is hit and miss. Sometimes the rice is so dry, other times it's great. Today my chicken was cooked just right and juicy, but our fries were over salted and ridiculously soggy. I also don't know what type of garlic sauce they're using for their bread but it tastes more metallic than anything else.  Sigh. Place needs a service overhaul BADLY"}
{"text":"As a virgin to the ever popular nando's chicken in my area, I was excited to try out the flavours of portegul. Now I will say, the flavour of the sauces themselves packed a little punch, but that's about where it stops. I ordered the quarter chicken, breast and wing..... Which they didn't have...... At lunch. They do know people come in for lunch right??? 10 mins later, I watch the patron beside me get a breast! Ugh. I had the salad and peri peri veggies. The veggies were good. The weird dressing... Not so much.  To sim this up, way over prices for substandard food. The leg way scrawny, good was a poor temperature. Keep on going IMO."}
{"text":"I have been a customer at a variety of different Nandos restaurants now for the past ten years across Toronto, Richmond Hill and Mississauga. So I was obviously excited to learn that there would now be an option in the city. I was totally disappointed last night when I finally had a chance to visit. We always order the full pack which comprises of a whole chicken, two large sides and a order of garlic bread. For the two of us this is just enough to fill us for dinner and have a lot left over. (We rather have more food than still be hungry after dinner). The food took very long to arrive at our table. The kitchen staff was so disorganized that they had to come to our table and ask me what I ordered because they misplaced their copy receipt.    When the food finally arrived, I immediately had to ask a couple questions as the food quantity was totally different from what I was used to. Firstly the large rice came in a very small bowel which could not have been holding more than to tablespoons of rice, the chicken which was supposed to be a whole chicken cut in eight pieces look like it was four regular sized pieces of chicken( two legs, a breast and a thigh) and four mini pieces of chicken (I'm talking like bite size - as if they took two pieces of chicken and cut it into four) I could not believe what they were serving us in comparison to what we normally get at the other locations.( We visit Nandos once a month) The location on Laird has never done this to us. Lastly but certainly not least the salad came to our table (LAST) ok so at every other normal location you can get the Mediterranean salad as a side - not at this location!! You can only get the César salad or a house salad, I chose the house salad. When they finally realized that they had forgotten our salad, it arrived at or table. The greens were all wilted and old. The salad was made of stale ingredients, I could not believe they would serve customers this quality of food. Needless to say this was a very very bad Nandos experience that will not be taking place again. I would rather wait and go to a different location. Never again."}
{"text":"Nando's grill was such a neat experience and the food was tasty. I had a veggie burger it was smothered in the house made spicy sauce, wasn't really my cup of tea but the chicken was wonderful, or so I was told as I am a vegetarian :)"}
{"text":"I'd heard of Nandos and I've always wanted to try Peri-Peri chicken. We were sat down at our table and given menus then had to go back to the front to order which is awkward. I noticed the plate sizes of a few ppl sitting around us so I ordered the 2 piece thigh and drumstick so I could give my brother the extra drumstick. Water cost $2 and I was given a cup which at first puzzled me lol after ordering you go pick up your cutlery and bottled sauces. For the $2 water you can pick up a corked bottled water which was nice. Wait time for the food was average to most restaurants and when it arrived it looked good. The 2 sides I ordered were corn on the cob which was grilled yet the butter had a hard time melting on it and the garlic mashed potatoes which were incredible but not plentiful. The hot Peri sauce made my mouth tingle for awhile lol. All in all the only problem I had with Nandos were the portion sizes. If i hadn't ordered that extra piece of chicken I'm sure I would have been hungry a couple hours later. If you want bang for your buck you're better off going to Cristy's chicken a few blocks down."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another shot after my previous mediocre experience. 8 hours after my meal, I began experiencing symptoms of food poisoning, and now they won't let up. I know this caused it because this is the only change I made to my diet within the last few days. I cannot even remember the last time I threw up, but after eating this I managed to do so (around 8 times). I'm going to miss an important party tomorrow, and I have Nandos to thank for it. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This chain was recommended to me as the go to for chicken. The chicken was amazing! We got the breast and wing combo and it was so juicy and flavorful. We tried the lemon and herb and the medium spice. Definitely take advantage of their flavor sauces as well if you want a little extra kick. And the garlic bread was really good too. Disappointed with the spiced rice, looked and tasted like it had been out for a while but the cashier was willing to switch it out for another side so we got a corn on the cob. Slightly grilled and it was decent. All in all the flame grilled chicken is the real story here and I would definitely come back again. If you're from the states as we are the comparable would be el pollo loco but this has it beat for me!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick fix if you're feeling a bit homesick! The only differences are that the extra hot isn't really quite \"extra hot\" compared to South Africa; and the slight menu variation. I really hope they bring the chicken breast and hot pots here one day."}
{"text":"Great place!  Huge portions and the service was spectacular"}
{"text":"The whole wheat chicken wrap that I got was very good. Spicy but not as spicy as I would have liked. Great price point."}
{"text":"This was probably my 50th half chicken meal at the nandos location. Quality food, beautiful decor, and very friendly staff. The key to the success of this location is consistency."}
{"text":"Food is great  but my only concern is how the sauce bottles seems unsanitary. Anybody can grab the bottle of sauce to their table. Touch it with their greasy hands( maybe some cough and saliva  flying while the bottle is on the customer's table) and staff will just return it back without sanitizing the bottle for the next customer..."}
{"text":"Top quality Portuguese churrasco style Chicken joint. Atmosphere is nice, think log cabin meets European homestead. Busy during lunches, you're greeted at the door, and seated; then you have to wait in line and order your food (as opposed to having a waitress take your order).  You also have to get your own napkins and cutlery, there's plenty bottles of 'peri peri' sauce to bring back to your table.  Mild, hot, super hot whatever your tolerance is there's a sauce for you. Get the chicken, it's good. Marinated and grilled properly melts off the bone and is very flavourful.  Regardless whether it's in a wrap, sandwich, or on a plate -  its tender and delicious!"}
{"text":"My mouth is watering as I write this review. I love the chicken ceaser wrap and their peri peri fries.  I love the peanuts mmmmm I love basically everything.  They only thing I'm not a fan of is waiting in line to put in your order. It's like half take out and half dine in. Maybe they are trying to save money on staff? They may as well have a self serve counter to put in your own order lol but the food is great so I won't complain."}
{"text":"Chicken is soooo good, i can eat a whole chicken by myself.   super healthy and great food. make sure you try the chicken liver."}
{"text":"Halal, colorful, amazing grilled chicken. Freshly cooked, with alot of varieties of side order. You gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"Very bad for take out this location. Terribly understaffed. Food is ready but sits there forever because the same people are on triple duty. I'll never come again during dinner hour."}
{"text":"Nando's has been a favourite of my husbands and I since its the one among the non-Indian food that has a nice kick too it. And it really does have a kick to it... lol.  The Nando's at Bay St. has a really warm atmosphere and the service is really good. I ordered some wings with a side of spiced rice and my husband had the chicken skewers with potato wedges. This was our first time ordering the skewers and I told my H that he should ask about the quantity and sure enough he didn't and sure enough it was not much (I've put up pics). Its really just two skewers and not enough meat! My husband ended up eating half my wings and side and another dinner after... I think that gives you an idea about the quantity.   Apart from that minor glitch... the food as always was amazing and we as usual bought a bottle of Nando's sauce (my fav is Lemon and Herb!).   So if you are craving chicken in some spicy sauce definitely give Nando's a try. I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants but Nando's is an exception. :)"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations, I was somewhat disappointed. I was expecting a nice juicy tasting chicken with seasoning... And the chicken was so plain, I couldn't finish it. Peri peri fries were okay, fries should be crispy not soft. And the mashed potato was good. It was a one time place, I tried it, now I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"The chicken at Nandos is tender and juicy.  I have tried it quite a few times & it has been very consistent.  If you don't like spicy food stick with one of the milder options.  You can always add the spicy garlic sauce on the table to it but it's hard to make it less spicy.  :)  The fries are always fresh & tasty.  I like their peri peri dip (kind of like a mayo with some spices mixed in) for the fries but it's a tiny cup which they charge aroud a $1 for so I'm not sure it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was pretty psyched about the first Nando's in downtown Toronto. I used to love this place as a late night fast food option during the years I lived in Nairobi, Kenya. It was cheap, open and pretty decent for post-bar food.  Not so fast. This place is trying to be more of a sit-down restaurant with table service. It's not really quite there, however. When I arrived (party of one) I was told to pick up a menu and order from the till, which is pretty awkward. My waiter wouldn't seat me, but kind of rudely gestured to a table across the room.  I ordered my meal with some suggestions from the friendly girl at the till. 1/4 chicken (leg & thigh) plus 2 sides (peri-peri fries & casa salad) and a soft drink. The total came to something over $16 + tip. So yeah, we're already way out of the league of most fast-food places.  Having paid, I trudged over and picked up some hot sauce and napkins from a huge shelf at the back. My food arrived pretty quickly, but I realized I would need to go back to the shelf for cutlery. Another trip was required when I realized the \"casa salad\" was undressed. What a pain.   The chicken leg was good, but small. The fries were limp and lukewarm. They seem to have run out of fries too, as a few small wedges were thrown in to fill it out. The salad, in addition to being undressed was as basic as salads come. It was served in a tiny bowl, which meant it was impossible to dress properly, or eat without dropping cucumbers or lettuce leaves.   The waiter popped by once for a cursory \"how's everything\" to which I lied, \"fine.\"  Overall this place is a kind of ethnic-theme-park-pseudo-fast-food restaurant with half-decent chicken at inflated prices. I won't be back anytime soon. Shame. They should have stuck with the fast-food philosophy instead of this half-way bucket of mediocre."}
{"text":"I've been to this Nando's location plenty of times and service fluctuates a lot, so does the food quality.   It is pricey for what you get and I usually get the chicken breast/wing combo with one side. Sometimes, if I feel like it, I'll get the chicken livers (just the app).. it's seriously so good. Get the garlic \"heat\" and it's great. The food is good.   I've only had one bad incident where I ordered my usual 1/4 chicken breast/wing combo and everyone at my table was served while I was waiting for my plate. After 5 minutes, I went up and asked and they said \"oh, we missed your order, we'll make it right away\". So I waited, very hungry at this point. My friends didn't want to start without me. When I finally got my plate, I hungrily ate everything quickly. Then I noticed they gave me 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh combo). By that time, I had already all everything so I couldn't argue. I went up and told them they delayed my order and messed it up. They didn't even apologize!   Anyway, I would suggest going to Churasso Villa just a couple blocks away! I heard it's really good. Next time, I guess.  P.S. You pay first and have to include the tip beforehand.. so the process is a bit backwards."}
{"text":"I can sum up this place with one word : Interesting. And because of this I'd say it's A-OK. It's hard for me to rate Nandos as this is the only place I know of to get peri-peri chicken. Definitely the draw of this place is the different types of chillies/sauces you get to try with the chicken each having a very distinctive and interesting flavor. Drawbacks are that the serving isn't particularly large so I never get full afterwards and the chicken does tend to be on the dry side from time to time."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place has fantastic decor.  It is very open concept and sort of puts you in a different place besides Canada.  Their chicken is well prepared as it is their specialty. I prefer this over Swiss Chalet any day. Their peri peri sauce is literally the bomb.  It is slightly overpriced, but I would still return."}
{"text":"Best ever! Nothing bad to say about this place. Excellent customer service. Food is a lot better than their other sister Nandos locations and best of all, the chicken is well done without having to ask over and over again. Their fries portions are great too. Definitely pays homage to their franchise back in Zambia. Well done!"}
{"text":"Why does Nando's rock? For one, the crispy, juicy deliciousness of the chicken. But more importantly, the sauce. I have thought about drinking it. You can buy it at some grocery stores and once I bought the entire stock (9 bottles) because it was on sale. It's that good. Even though the chicken is pre-sauced, you'll probably end up pouring tons on during the meal. Addictive stuff with a citrus flavor and a nice heat that isn't too overwhelming even at the extra hot.  Here's how it works: Pick out which kinds of chicken you want (half/full chicken, wings, or skewers in any combination) the spiciness level of the chicken from mild to extra hot (you can do half and half on any order) and your sides. Then you get a number and sit down and they'll bring your food to you.  If you like spicy, flavorful chicken, this is as good as it gets. By the way, the reviews below about the veggie options totally miss the mark. The name of the place is Nando's Flame Grilled CHICKEN. I can appreciate not eating meat, but don't judge a place for options it only provides as a last resort for those who would otherwise not be able to eat anything while their meat eating friends are dining. The price is right and you get pretty decent portions. For 27 bucks we got enough food for two men and one woman."}
{"text":"I am a chicken person and i must say the chicken is well cooked.the spices are balance.my personal favourite is the herb and lime chicken with spicy rice.my kids love it too!"}
{"text":"The chicken you get is a very small amount for what you pay for it. The fries were good but the glasses they give out for the pop are very small, even though refills are free. Service was friendly and on time. I give this place 2 stars. Would've given it 3 but they're very overpriced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"3 stars just for the consistency of the chicken & the peri-peri sauces. Other than that, this branch sucks for big groups. Details regarding this are on the tip I posted.   I don't expect this review to be recommended,  but in any case I only recommend going to this particular branch if & only if: - you have a lot of time - you're in a good mood - don't require ketchup because it gets hard to locate this condiment if you asked any of the staff - you're in a group of no more than two - you eat during off-peak hours"}
{"text":"Great food, great price. Really reasonably priced food. Even though the portions were not the largest, it was still filling. It was my first time there and I got a chicken pita which was really good, with their peri peri fries, and it was about $10.  The bathroom was very clean, and had a separate sink for the stall which was a really great small thing that I appreciated. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My first time at a Nandos. It was OK but not spectacular. I expected more flavour and crispy skin from the chicken. I chose the spiciest sauce and it was milder than Tabasco and a bit too sweet- I prefer a Southern US or Mexican hot sauce. Pretty good value for money, but the ambiance is somewhere between a restaurant and a food court."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best flame grilled chicken!  I'm not too crazy about the sides, but the chicken liver is definitely worth ordering.  The restaurant itself is very busy and small- I would recommend taking your food home or even buying their sauce and marinating your own chicken!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to give Nando's only two stars, but this is my second visit to this location and no impressed.  I have enjoyed the companies product for a long time and used to go to the (now closed) Bathurst and Eglinton location and then the Richmond Hill store.  I ordered the half chicken and my friend the quarter white, both with wedges and slaw.  We also order a hummus appetizer.   After waiting and waiting my friend went up to check on the hummus and was told they would check.  Wait wait wait and finally it arrives along with mains. When question are told \"Well I didn't want your chicken to get cold\".  Ooooook right sure what does one want with an appetizer that comes with the meal? But no let me take that off your bill.  Then when done the manager or owner comes by and asks how it was and explain to him this. He says let me talk to the kitchen, never hear from him again.  No one offered to remove the item or even say they were sorry.  As a side note when one orders a half chicken it should come as a half a chicken and not two pieces that were never from the same chicken.  Also chicken portions here are getting smaller and boarder on Cornish hen size.  Although I like Nando's in general do not know if I will return to this location."}
{"text":"My first experience with Nando's Chicken happened to be while I was dating a guy on the West Coast. I should have known he wasn't the brightest crayon in the box when his idea of a good time was taking his vegetarian girlfriend to a chicken joint.   Lucky for me, Nando's chicken doesn't serve chicken alone. Unlike Mr. boyfriend, they keep vegetarians' needs in mind. For those of us who don't eat bird, they serve wraps, veggie burgers, salads, fries, rice, baked potatoes and dessert.   The food was decent, as was the pricing.   I recently took a trip down memory lane by visiting the location here in Calgary, and I was happy to see that my experience here parallelled my experience in BC.   The service is fast, the food is decent, and the atmosphere is welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   But Lets get the negative out of the way right from the get go because there is only one - price to portion ratio. Yes the chickens are a little anorexic given what you pay BUT - they tastez so guuuddd. KFC can be \"finger licking\" good all they want, Nandos is \"Hand licking, down my forearm, maybe even lick my elbow if some sauce ends up there - GOOD.\"  I have one long time friend that I do not get to hang out with as much as I would like to, BUT we always make an effort to visit Nandos together 2-3 times a year. Unbeknownst to him I refuse to go there without out him - its kinda our thing.   Each time we go we always order the same meal: The Four Pack ($32) and 4 Heineken. The Four pack comes with a whole flame-grilled chicken, your choice of 2 large sidelines, and 3 Portuguese buns or garlic bread. For the sidelines we always get their Caesar salad and the Peri Peri fries - which are tossed in a dry Peri peri salt and are AMAZEBALLS!   As for the Peri Peri marinade at Nandos you can order any of their items in either Garlic, Medium, Hot or Extra Hot or EXTRA EXTRA Hot. My friend and I always stupidly think we are bigger than the hot sauce and go XX Hot - silly boys. Midway through we are gasping, the tears streaming down our faces are a mix of pain and joy and we have completed all 4 of our beers.   Usually around this time we are usually reaching for the bottles of peri peri garlic sauce on our table and our fries to try and calm our burning tongues  - thank goodness for the garlic bread (always comes in handy).   There has seldom been a time when I have gone to Nandos where I have not left there, satisfied, full, happy and mouth still burning. I look forward to seeing my friend next because I know exactly where we will be going for dinner that night :)"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor.. what can I say I love chicken. The Piri Piri fries is a must have. I got half a chicken - Extra hot.  It was delivered on time and I had a blast.  I did have some ambivalence when I was ordering as there are so  much good thins on the menu.. I was thinking of devouring a full chicken.. that in itself would be a feature presentation and a thing to watch ;).. I am glad I got the half chicken it was perfect I hope they open another location in the SW. I live in the SW and drove all the way to the NE for Nando's.. but it was so worth it.  The day I went, they played some salsa music, which was amazing.. I love the ambiance, my personal trainer is so mad at me now.. as I indulge in Nando's flame grilled chicken,, I hope she does not read this review ;)"}
{"text":"Let's just say Nando's chicken taste better than Swiss Chalet chicken. I came here for dinner on a weekend and it was packed. It looks like a sit down restaurant with waiter service but it is not. The hostess will sit you down and give you the menus but you have to go up to the counter to order the food and pay. They give you a glass of water so you can take it back to your table. Also, cutlery, napkins, sauce and drinks are all self-serve.  The food came in a timely manner has my party got the variety chicken assortment where it came with 2 chicken skewers, 5 wings and  1/2 chicken. Overall, the chicken had a lot of grill flavour even though we got it plain. The chicken skewers were definitely the driest out of the bunch and sauce was a necessity to eat it. The wings were great as I would give them 5 stars. Taste hot and came straight out from the grill. The  1/2 chicken was also decent. It was moist and not too dry. The skin was good as well.  For the sides, we got the Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. These were so-so. Variety said it could serve 2-3 people but I guess for 2 hungry people it was not enough. So we ordered a large Caesar, Portuguese custard tart and corn. The Caesar salad dressing was not too sour so it was good. If the Portuguese custard tart were warmer, it would be great. Corn was so-so as well.  Overall, the chicken is the outstanding part of the meal as the sides are average."}
{"text":"My first negative review.  The chicken is the best, and the corn was good, however I suggest take out for this place. The place was dirty. There were 5-6 tables with dishes stacked. Floor and washrooms a mess.  A few of the staff just did not care and were not talking to each other nicely. The guy in charge of our table was eating his cake and milk instead of Serving our food. On a Saturday night they were running out of chicken!  Coleslaw did not taste, and even their famous fries seemed hard and reheated."}
{"text":"The chicken is alright, but not outstanding. Everything about this place is kinda forgettable. I mean, it's just nando's, only come here if it's convenient and you're craving chicken. The \"hot\" sauce is not even remotely hot, and the other sauces were alright. The value is not that great either. We got the family deal that comes with corn and bread, but in retrospect we could have gotten more food for the same money from the dim sum and chicken section at t&t in the same plaza. Nando's = meh."}
{"text":"I love Nando's chicken as much as I love Swiss chalet.  The decor at this Nando is very nice and inviting. This place itself isn't that big and can fill up quickly during the weekends.     I got the half chicken with 2 sidelines (spiced rice and fries).  The chicken here is always cooked to perfection and isn't dry at all.  The spice on the chicken is amazing as well as the sauce. They have a wide variety of sauce for your liken from spicy to non-spicy ones.  I am sure you will be able to find one you like.  Pricing is reasonable for what you are getting and will fill you up for sure.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"I totally dis-agree w/ some people w/ a poor review. Been going here ever since and the service and food is perfect compared in Nandos downtown. Here in Eglington location they serve the best tender-juicy grilled chicken ever! Service crew give you a warm welcome smile and they are really good on what they do. More importantly is the food- the food here is grilled and serve fresh and hot. Keep the good vibe Nandos Eglington."}
{"text":"The set-up for Nando's is like a fast food restaurant: pay up front then take a seat. Grab your own utensils and drink. Actually they seat you first then you go order, but I prefer if this was reversed.   This location has very nice decor and a great ambiance. Gets very busy during dinnertime.   Service was slow. You can see they have many orders (dine-in and take-out) to fulfill. I had the dark meat quarter chicken with 2 sides: peri peri fries and peri-peri vegetables for $12.85. The chicken was lemon and herb, which was tasty. Not a huge portion but succulent. The fries were nicely seasoned but disappointingly not super crispy. I ordered the peri-peri vegetables to up my veggie intake and I really should not have. It was mostly peppers and I was excited seeing all the minced garlic, but the sauce really threw me off. It added a sour taste to everything.   My previous times here, the chicken has been consistent and tasty, so you can count on it tasting good. Service and sides are questionable."}
{"text":"Nandos is nandos. Like the food is what you expect from any other nandos but what is special about this location is the decor. Never have I been to a nandos that looked as nice as this one."}
{"text":"I always get my favourite thing on the menu here. The peri peri chicken sandwich and the potato wedges (my friend gets the mashed potatoes so we get the best of both). The service was BAD though, so slow and it took so long just to refill our waters. Other locations are better than this."}
{"text":"I came very excited to try Nando's for the first time because I wanted to try something new but left very disappointed. The chicken was nothing special and the vegetables in the side salad I ordered were all wilted and disgusting. I asked to change it to rice and even the rice was all hard and tasted as if it was a  couple of weeks old. The prices here are very unreasonable and this was probably one of my worse eating out experiences. I definitely will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and each time I leave feeling dissatisfied. The chicken portions are small.  The sides are decent, like the fries. Their sides are nothing to write home about. They make a good sangria. The chicken I always get tends to be on the drier side.  Their sauces are what stands out at this place.  Other than that I'd rather cook my own chicken than pay the price at Nandos. I hope my friends don't drag me here again haha."}
{"text":"Nando's is an Afro-Portuguese restaurant specializing in various dishes mostly grill chicken oriented. The chicken and rice dishes are characterized by lemon, spices and Peri-Peri. Peri-Peri is African Birdseye Chili and has a sweet distinctive flavour, definitely goes hand in hand w/ lemon and garlic.  Overall I feel the food is overpriced for what you get. I do enjoy some meals at Nando's, yet some meals remain under par. At times the chicken is way overcooked, rendering thee meat dry and burnt. Other times the chicken is cooked well, but there's barely any meat on the bone, especially with their wings. The portions and quality of food is inconsistent, questionable for the price you pay.   I do really enjoy the Peri-Peri seasoned chips (fries), they are always a staple for me if I eat chez Nando's. Other sides include spiced rice, baked potatoes, coleslaw and corn. Whenever ordering my meal I always use a fair amount of Nando's house sauces such as the hot Peri-Peri and Garlic sauce.  I couldn't see myself going out of my way to eat at Nando's, but it is a decent restaurant with good service. A big plus for them is they have a well crafted and interactive website. It provides you with a solid history of the franchise, as well as recipes to their dishes! I find that to be so rare these days. If you're interested in hitting this joint ;) find a place near you.   http://www.nandoscanada.com/sections.html#Our%20Restaurants"}
{"text":"PERI PERI!!!!!!!  Nando's is great healthy chicken. The service is good, the food is better and their sauces are just unreal! Anytime you are around Yonge and Rutherford (16th ave) and have 30 mins you can spare or need to waste, check out Nando's! As a bonus, if you eat your chicken really fast and still need to waste more time, there is mini golf and laser tag in the plaza ! YAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard only good things about this chain from a friend who just luvs this place. She goes on and on about how great their piri piri sauces are and even stocks up on them at home :) Since we were a larger group we called in and tried to make a reservation but nope they only take those for groups of 15 people +. Ah well since my hosts live nearby we decided to just venture out here. The place is quite big and there is a steady flow of customers to keep them busy.  We ordered two family combos a couple of skewers and for moi and an another adventurous eater we ordered the chicken livers as well. The ordering part is kind of painful IMO even though I was with a person who is well versed with their menu.  Never mind we waited for our food patiently. The first two combos arrived fast but we were told the buns would have to wait till later, not a good sign if they are out of fresh bread. Then we were told the chicken livers would take longer as well, understandable as I am guessing its not their hot seller (being not for the faint of heart I suppose :)  I tried the medium spiced level as there were some children in our group that couldn't handle hot food. Even for a medium the chicken is spiced well. Nice, juicy finish for the dark meat. White meat was not as moist but still better than your supermarket chicken by a long mile. The really hot sauce packed a wallop as well. Sides were mundane IMO. Even after 20 min had elapsed there was no sign of the chicken hearts or the dinner rolls. We were told we had a to wait a bit longer hmm not good as it was bordering on unacceptable. Finally the chicken livers arrived but still no sign of the dinner rolls. We had ordered the livers hot spice level. They don't pull any punches here and it tasted good. I will try again for sure. The skewers were popular as well.  Some of the kids wanted dessert and sure enough the froyo machine was broken. We decided to subs for a Portuguese tart but still a no go as there was a wait on them. Finally the kids settled on ice cream. They brought us an extra serving but the ridiculous wait had spoiled it for me. Ice cream was decent Then we got the dinner rolls after all the food had finished!  The service needs an overhaul here as there were far too many mistakes in the order. The did make up for after asking for it several times but it has brought this place down a notch in my book. 3.5 Stars for food half star deducted for the multiple order mix ups."}
{"text":"I don't see how chicken can get any better than this. The Nando's sauces are to die for. A little pricey perhaps, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I first heard about Nando's from my friend Jennifer, she got a tip from a taxi driver for great chicken. The lesson learned here, Uber drivers likely have better recommendations. If you're looking for that true Portuguese taste with all that super Churrasco flavor then pass this place by, you won't find it here. I find it interesting how many say the service here is good when their is hardly any service provided at all. Nando's feels more like a self serve cafeteria than a restaurant. You seat yourself, they bring you a menu and tell you the rules, yes, rules. 1).  go to the cash to order and pay for your food in advance.  So you get up from your table and go to order your food and pay before you eat.  2). you are told not to forget your table number. 3).  The cashier reminds you to pick up your silverware and napkins before you sit down. 4). They bring you your food which in my case was cold (if you like cold fries you are in luck). 5). You have to get back up from your meal and seat to get any condiments,  and don't forget any as you will have to get up again. 6).  No one checks in on you to see if everything is ok or offers to bring you more water. 7). After your meal you leave and no one notices you going or thanks you for your patronage. This service is not too different from a McDonalds.  The food itself is on pare with Swiss Chalet and the acoustics suck. My opinion this place has nothing going for it and I won't be back. WARNING DON'T ORDER THE GREEN PEAS!"}
{"text":"Best Nandos location!!! Ambiance is great. Very festive and cultural. Other locations are quite small but this one is massive. Can accompany large parties easily. Food is amazing as always. Different concept with drinks-it has that new \"choose your own\" drink vending machine which is unlimited refills. You have to grab your own cutlery and peri peri sauce bottles. But it gives you a chance to walk around and explore the place!"}
{"text":"First time trying Nandos, my friend mentioned he saw different menu items compared to the one he goes to in DC. The chicken was tasty and I liked that the sauces were available so that you could try difference ones or add more. Tried the new crusted wings, they were delicious! The only thing was that it was more pricey than what I expected for the serving portions. My chicken sandwich had a sad ratio of bread to chicken."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????xp"}
{"text":"I came to Nando's yesterday with a few friends for lunch. It was my first time and immediately upon walking in I was very impressed by the interior decoration - the restaurant really is stunning and the designs are creative. It had a great atmosphere!  I chose to order the Quinoa salad (with greens, tomatoes, avocado, sweet potato, crumbled feta and seeds - mmmm) and added some chicken to it for $4.95. I thought the chicken portion was small considering the price paid to add it, but the salad as a whole was filling nonetheless.   I grabbed a few of their Piri Piri sauces - the garlic, medium, and hot - and tried each one with some of my chicken slices. All were really delicious and I liked the option to add more to your meal! I personally only like heat in moderation so my chicken was marinated in the Lemon & Herb Piri Piri flavour (your choice - it can go from mild to very hot) and I just added a bit of the sauce to it after. It was delicious.  I'd come back to a Nando's, but I've heard that the franchised locations aren't as nice as the corporate locations (which this one was). Something to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for service.    Nando's is a regular takeout spot for us.  We usually call ahead and it is ready about 15-20 minutes after calling it in.  We arrived within 20 minutes and after paying we were told it would be another 10 minutes.  The restaurant was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday evening.  We sat and waited for our order to be called out.  We waited and waited and waited.  After 30 minutes Mr Leny went to ask and discovered that our order had been sitting there the whole time.  Staff had forgotten to write PAID on the receipt so it was not called out.  By this time our food was cold so we asked for our money back.  The manager reluctantly issued a refund. We were starving when we got home and had to pull something out from the freezer for dinner.  Beyond annoyed and disappointed  Mr Leny said this was not the first time.  Management seems to have changed several times over the years and they never seem to be well organized. They really need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"This place was just newly decorated .  It is brighter and more modern looking with more space. They added an unlimited drink station which is a bonus. The chicken is very good and you can put your own level of heat. Live the rice and potato wedges for sides.  The family packs are a great deal for 3-4 people. Service is excellent but you tip before you get your food and I'm not sure if the money gets to the right people."}

{"text":"It was my first time trying peri-peri so I thought I'd do some quick research.  Peri Peri (or piri piri) is the portuguese name for the African Bird's Eye Chili (which on further inspection, looks nothing like a bird's eye...or a bird...or an eye...).  And consequently, Nando's is a chain hailing out of South African where Nando's Peri Peri Sauce is a local celebrity.  This particular Nando's was recommended to me by a friend.  I was expecting a Taco Bell type of establishment but was surprised at the set up.  The design is very user friendly and the staff is very polite and all smiles.  The operation works with you making an order, being provided a number and then finding a comfortable seat to await your order to be delivered to you.  A very balanced fusion of restaurant and fast food.  The menu itself seemed simple enough, focusing on chicken and level of spice you want.  Either you can have a pita or a chicken plate.  The sides range from spicy rice to fries to salad, the regular assortment found at most establishments.  To the chicken...I didn't try the pita but my friend raved about it and the portion size (filling).  I had the quarter chicken (breast) plate with fries and a salad.  The chicken looked weird from the start (see picture), like an overgrown but scrawny chicken had wandered into nando's looking for what the big fuss was about this bird's eye chili, only to end up on my plate.    However, the chicken was great.  I got hot and like to think that over the years of force feeding myself hot chicken wings, I could handle a little spice...but that chili is HOT!  I sucked back my tears and ate my chicken, which outside of the heat has a great taste.  If you aren't big on spicy food, they have milder versions and also have some pretty good side sauces that can be applied (pictures).    Overall, I'm a fan.  The concept is simple, the location clean and the staff is friendly.  I look forward to discovering the other locations in the west end..."}
{"text":"Got a Chicken dinner combo with beast , legs and skewers along with two sides to take home. The sides were the garlic mashed and the spicy peas. Waited around 25 minutes for the order. When we got the box , it seemed a bit small but on further inspection was rammed to the gills with chicken. The chicken was enough for two meals, including lunch the next day. The sides seemed a bit miniscule though. The mashed potatoes were good but I would not get the peas again.   Alas the whole shebang was $28.... at our local Churisco place back in the West End we could have got two sides and a whole chicken for $20...might be time to take the bike into little Portugal again ..."}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about Nando's and finally had a chance to try it last Sunday. O.M.G. Amazing! The chicken is super tender, juicy and spiced perfectly. It is the best chicken I have ever had. Garlic mashed potatoes and peri-peri vegetables were so good as well.   The prices are higher than Swiss Chalet and portion sizes are definitely much smaller. We ordered 1 chicken sandwich, 1/4 chicken dinner with 2 sides to share. We were still hungry after dinner and had to get big mac's at the McDonald's near by.   The dining room is beautifully decorated. It's a nice cozy place to have dinner on a wintry night. The tables and booths are roomy and comfortable.   The servers were all quite friendly. But we had to wait 1/2 hour for quarter chicken dinner which I found strange as this is their signature dish. Perhaps just some kinks to iron out in their first month of operations."}
{"text":"This is a chain! The food and ambiance is great but a bit overprice."}
{"text":"Horrendous service - put in an order through Skip-the-Dishes - said it would be done at 5, show up and they can't seem to find the order, they say they're 'working on it', don't get the order until 5:45...ordered coleslaw, they give me peas...I mean sure, they're both vegetables but that's not really quite right is it?"}
{"text":"I come to nandos to eat a couple times a year because they have really tasty chicken and good peri- peri sauce   My boyfriend and I ordered the double leg chicken plate and garlic bread with salad as well   The chicken size is a lot smaller than other chicken places but flavour is so good , they have different hotness levels and they all have great flavour.   We got glasses of water but the glass had so many water spots on it you would barely see through it. So I had to ask for new glasses.  Our garlic bread was brought to the wrong table and because the table started eating it we had to wait for more garlic bread.  The price is alright  The place has a really nice atmosphere, nice decor   Service was alright aswell"}
{"text":"Nando's is great, the first time I went there I was confused as I was proceeding to sit down but I was flagged down by the waitress asking me to order and pay for my food before I sit down, it's a neat concept  The chicken is great and the garlic bread is amazing, also being a brown guy who loves spicy food (but honestly, which brown person doesn't?) I LOVE their hot sauce, it's actually hot! not like other hot sauces that peeps claim to be hot.  the staff is friendly and courteous also.  Will be definitely going there again soon with my better half."}
{"text":"The chicken is perfectly grilled and the Peri Peri sauce (especially garlic) makes it even better. The fries are delicious as well. The staff was quick and friendly. It's definitely my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from nando's one weekday for lunch. Shared the variety platter which included half a chicken, 2 skewers, 5 wings, and 2 sides (we ordered the peri peri fries and coleslaw). It states on the website that it is for 2 to 3 people, but I wouldn't recommend adding a 3rd person or you'll still be left feeling hungry. We requested medium spice, but ended up using their packet hot sauce which still did not bring in the heat as expected. Their peri peri garlic sauce reminded me of italian dressing. Although I'm a fan of chicken, I thought this order was only mediocre."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with the food here.  If you like portobello and halloumi, I strongly suggest the sandwich. The veggie sandwich and chicken wraps were so-so in comparison."}
{"text":"The chicken is quite tasty here. The sides and desert are not bad either. Only problem with this location is, turnover is real slow and its small. I find myself getting takeout more often then I would like."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the best experience here. The atmosphere was lovely and the food was delicious. What really made the whole visit was the service. The people here are the friendliest and will make your experience exceptional.  We ordered the chicken wings, fries, and quesadillas. All were delicious and hot and the selection of Peri Peri sauce really made the meal. For desert we got the Natas and unlimited frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt was okay but the Natas were really great. If you don't know what they are (like us before the visit), they are Portuguese custard tarts that we both really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Came here for my first time. Loved it! Flavors were all there, cool atmosphere. Would return!"}
{"text":"Good place.  Funny concept of ordering.  Chicken is really good like the good portuguese chicken places.  So I recommend.    Side dishes like the macho peas, mashed potatoes and veggies are good choice!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has the CUTEST decor ever! I'm actually obsessed with it.  Also, the service is  fan-tastic.  Someone explained the entire menu and the restaurant concept (order and pay at the counter first and you help yourself to condiments, drinks, and utensils) when I sat down.  Two people came by halfway through our meals to see if everything was okay as well.  The food.  We had hummus with pita to start.  I love hummus so this was no different.  The portion is pretty small though so I probably wouldn't get it again.  We got the full pack share platter.  It came with the MOST oily delicious garlic bread.  Remember to eat these before they get cold and hard.  The large side of veggies was SMALL and flavoured poorly.  It also mainly had onions in it which weren't really cooked through so I didn't enjoy this at all.  The mash potato on the other hand great!  ok so the chicken.  It was pretty moist and had lots of flavour.  But I was hoping the skin would be crispy and instead it was kind of soggy. Who doesn't love eating crispy chicken skin right?!  Basically it wasn't anything outstanding that makes me in a hurry to come again anytime soon."}
{"text":"If I were to compare it to Swiss Chalet.. no Swiss Chalet sauce. Peri Peri seasoning which is spicy! I had the mild and my tongue could felt the heat. Pricing is per piece of chicken, then the option of one side or two sides. I had two sides so that cost $11.40 if I'm not mistaken.  Great space. Nice staff. Lovely interior design. Historically speaking this is where the old Cadillac dealership was."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner one night, and I can't say that this place is anything special. It wasn't bad, but for all the hype that people put around it, it's really not worth it.   When you walk into the restaurant, you immediately walk into the line-up where you pick and choose whatever it is that you want. I had a quarter chicken that was doused in the medium sauce and some wedges. I wasn't overly excited about any of the sides on the menu, so I decided to settle.   The chicken was pretty moist and the sauce definitely had a kick to it. I can take a lot of heat and I could definitely feel the hit on this one. The wedges were good. Crispy, sprinkled with some salt and paprika? I think, but overall, they were pretty good.  Again, this place wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't something that blew my mind. Would I go back? Only if I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"I have to preface my review by saying Nando's is much better in England - the chicken is bigger and there are 7-8 varieties of sauces, which is what Nando's is all about!! Everybody loves it there, and the half self-service runs like a well-oiled machine.   It seems the Canadian ones are slowly improving, with wider menu options than before. I hope they follow suit with sauces.  Bay St is one of the fanciest ones I've been to, decor-wise, with all the beaded string action hanging above the booths, and a nice sectioned off area for a larger/private party. Plenty of seating for groups.  Food was fairly quick after ordering at the front, service decent, and probably one of the better ones in terms of flavour.   Always, always get your fries peri-peried!  And P.S. Yes, it is better than Swiss Chalet (across the pond, at least :P )"}
{"text":"First - let's have a refresher: this Nando's is based on the UK version.  So, you get seated, then order at the front, grab your awesome soft drink from the Coke Freestyle machine, grab some cutlery and sit down and wait for your food.  I feel like some of these haterade comments are based on the fact people went in thinking it was a sit down restaurant in entirety, and that, it is not.  And never claimed to be.    So, now that he have that out of the way, my lunch was the bomb!  I had a Piri-Piri chicken sandwich, with Piri-Piri fries and sauce.  It was served promptly and tasted great!    Also, the interior of this place is awesome - really beautiful to look at.  I really enjoyed my lunch and it is much nicer than the first Nandos in the GTA back in the day in Brampton.  Give it a shot!  There's not much around the area that's good to eat!"}
{"text":"The food here wasn't good at all. The meat was done right, but it just tasted like there was no flavouring. Even the flavoured rice tasted like plastic. There was about 3 veggie options, but they were mainly just wraps and sandwiches. The service was quick, we got all our food for 6 people in less than 10 minutes. The sauces they provide is okay, but not very flavourful and mainly tasted like hot sauce."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time for a lunch catch-up date and it was a great choice for us.  Located north of College/Bay, the restaurant is quite sizeable for prime real estate.  It's an open airy concept with warm and inviting decor.  You are seated, invited to order at the counter and then your meal is served to your table.  We ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with peri peri fries and coleslaw.  Chicken is crispy yet moist and very fresh.  Peri peri fries offer quite an edgy twist.  Coleslaw was a refreshing touch.  We enjoyed our meals.  Service was quite outstanding as we were promptly greeted; had the process explained as we were newcomers; and had a check-in midway through our meal.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are here after work.  It was a wonderful place to eat and beautifully decorated.  It was clean and it smelled so good inside.  I had a half chicken, with mashed potatoes and garlic bread.  The chicken was so juicy and tender the flavors of my chicken was finger licking good!  I love Nandos so much!  It is family friendly and there are many options to choose from.   Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I tried Nando's today for the first time not expecting much and it was surprisingly fairly good! I was under the impression that it was a lot like Swiss Chalet (which in my opinion, is very underwhelming and definitely not worth its price point) but to my surprise, while SC focuses on rotisserie chicken, Nando's was far superior with their flame-grilled chicken.  I say this because I ordered a lemon & herb quarter chicken leg with fries, and the chicken was so delicious. It was juicy, tender, succulent meat and you could really taste the flavours of their secret marination sauce infused throughout the entire piece of chicken. The fries on the other hand, by themselves, were just ok... not my favourite as I found them to be more hard/crunchy than light/crispy, but I gotta say I really liked the seasoning that they used!   A note if it's your first time coming here: the store concept is half-fast-food-half-restaurant. You have to go up to the cashier to order and pay, and you also have to get your own cutlery/condiments/tissues/drinks from little stations tucked away in the corners/sides of the restaurant. However, non-designated servers will bring your food to you and also take your dishes away after you're done (so you can gauge how you want to tip when you pay)."}
{"text":"Even though I have been to the Home Sense and Marshalls close to this Nando's for so many times, I missed this nice Portuguese peri-peri Chicken place since it's open. What a pity!  The staff here are very friendly and explain how the order process works to me since I guess I'm looking so confused. If you choose to dine in, grab a seat first, go through the menu, go to the cashier counter to place and pay the order. Then all you have to do is wait until the server brings your food. Yep, like this simple. My problem is how much tips do I have to pay......Next time I'd better choose to order take-out. Then this won't bother me anymore lol  We choose a half chicken with Mango Lime sauce, plus salad and potato wedges as sides. The portion is great for two girls. There are various sauce options. Nice to try. My favourite is the garlic one."}
{"text":"Terrible take out process. Watched my food sit in the window for 10 minutes while I waited and watched it. Despite asking about it and being told it'll be longer than expected , then being handed the food I was watching. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Finally made it here! 1 star for cleanliness 2 stars for service 5 stars for FOOD!  This was the best chicken I have had since I was in Jamaica a few years ago, so I was really impressed with the food. This place was a cross between African and Spanish. The Peri Peri sauce on the table is addictive and to die for if you like heat. Loved it and used about 1/4 of the bottle. The music playing was Spanish and that gets a star for sure.  The staff needed to care a bit more esp. about the washrooms (ick) and wiping down tables. Even when one gal came to wipe clean our table after asking her, it was still dirty. Otherwise the restaurant is really cute. You order at the counter, and grab a seat! The food comes out to you fairly quickly. I would get take-out next time and what we got, I would get again - chicken ( double legs and a 1/4 chicken), Spanish rice (deelish), Peri Wedges (OMG, hot and fresh, yummy!).You can take out a whole chicken for $18. Loved the Peri spice on the table too. I am glad we looked past the initial issues and stayed as we really enjoyed what we ate."}
{"text":"Totally hit the spot. Nice ambiance at the Bay St location. Nice Canadian VQA wine selection. I had the wrap - totally what I wanted - so good."}
{"text":"Love the peri peri spicy chicken! Got a full chicken and me and my girlfriend finished it!!  Their peri peri wedges are one of the best in towns! And the delicious tart to finish off a great meal! We will be back again!! Great service as well!!"}
{"text":"Drove past this place a million time's and finally decided to stop and see how it was. It was great. Flame broiled Peri-Peri Chicken just made my top 5. The atmosphere was neat, they seat you with menu's and when your ready you order at the counter and they bring your food. The meal was delicious and the price was unbeatable. Flavors and tenderness of those beautifully broiled birds was fantastic. You can choose your level of heat from mild to face melting and I went with a medium that was just the rite amount of heat and flavor. The side's (Garlic Mash & Peri- Peri roasted veg) were also fantastic however next time I'll order Nando Size. (Because I'm a slob) Not alotof places in town that offer BBQ Chicken so if you get a chance be sure and stop by. You won't be let down."}
{"text":"I love Nandos as a franchise. The downtown location is extra special because the decor is really nice compared to other Nando locations, but the prices are still the same.  I've been to Nandos over 10x now. I always start off with the Portuguese bun. Then I order their extra hot chicken ( full chicken usually as I'm at Nandos with my family or girlfriend). We also usually get the chicken liver plate. I didn't know about this until recently , and now I get it every time we go there. Dipping the Portuguese bun into the liver is the secret !  We don't tend to get the sides usually. The sides are mediocre and nothing special. We usually just double down on the chicken itself and if I'm still hungry, I'd get an extra Portuguese bun because they are so damn good.  My favourite part about Nandos is how cheap it is. You can get a half chicken plat with two sides for less than $15! My family of four usually grab 2 full chicken $19 each , one chicken liver plate and a few Portuguese buns. The bill comes to around $15 to $20 per person after tax and tip !"}
{"text":"We ordered 1/4 chicken leg and thigh take out, but it's totally burnt out. If you really want to eat here,  don't take out."}
{"text":"Iv had nandos chicken in several different location, Actually; in different countries ( South Africa and Namibia).  Even though the taste of the product is sub-par to what im used to in africa. Still amazing , but a little on the pricey side. There are plenty more Portuguese bbq joints in town with at par flavour and more authentic side orders. Nando's has become very commercial and has lost some of its authenticity."}
{"text":"I had a takeout order - waited about 15 min periperi half chicken. The meat is so tender & juicy!"}
{"text":"Just tried this for lunch. Chicken was cooked right. It was delicious really. It's a bit like a fast food where you order in a line up but then they deliver the food. I liked it."}
{"text":"My guy wanted to go to this restaurant as he mainly eats chicken. We drove across town to go here especially. We each ordered a chicken piri sandwich and it was rather boring. Yes it was good chicken, but it's not difficult to make good chicken at home that has some heat. The fries were rather basic with piri dust sprinkled on top. Rather boring. It was expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"This place is five minutes from my work (dangerous) and I love coming here! Such a pretty location and the service and food is bomb. And on top of that, it's halal! So great."}
{"text":"Honestly I forgot how good this place was. This was my first time having Nandos since the summer. We were immediately greeted and at first, I was thrown off. There was never a host/hostess when I last came and there didn't seem to be a strict table service structure either. My friend and I sat at a booth after the table was quickly wiped. We ordered half a chicken of lemon and herb (spice is painful) with a side of Peri Peri fries and mashed potatoes.  Of course, we compared this to other rotisserie chicken places including Swiss Chalet and take-away whole chickens from your local grocery store. It was an amazing meal - perfectly cooked chicken with a light glaze. The sides were also seasoned nicely - nothing was overly spicy (the fries). Just to be experimental, I dabbed some pieces of chicken in the least spiciest hot sauce - the Garlic Hot sauce. Keep in mind I'm someone who finds kimchi and Sweet Chilli Heat chips spicy. I still survived and was content with my meal.  I was also contemplating getting a Portuguese tart however, they looked like they've beens sitting there for the entire day. If there was a way for them to reheat them, I would have purchased one or two but I've neglected to ask and was already pretty full from my meal.  Another thing I want to note is how the workers seemed very diligent. I find this to be a good sign as hard works usually pay off, and that is shown through the consistently satisfied customers (including myself).  Overall, the place portrayed itself as an ethical and positive workplace, which made my customer experience equally as positive."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place is great - delicious food, good atmosphere, cool decor, friendly staff. My go-to meal is the lemon herb chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and peri peri fries. A lot of carbs but worth it! The side of veggies are good too but their beans are just ok.   Downsides to this place are that there are no gluten-free desserts. They only have Portugese egg tarts. Also you have to line up and order instead of them taking your order at the table. It's quite awkward since they seat you and tell you to go up to order. So you have to have something to leave on your seat to \"claim your spot\" while you go up to order. At least they bring it to your table when it's ready, but still. Not cool."}
{"text":"This review is for the service only.  I love eating at Nandos, and have loved it for years. Since moving to the neighbourhood I was happy to see that there is a Nandos so close to me. I have ordered from this location many times and always had the same problem. It takes forever to get through to someone on the phone (many times I've given up) and when you do order it's not ready in the time that they say. I've also tried going in and ordering from the counter and waiting to take out and I always end up waiting at least half an hour. The food is great once you get it, but it just takes forever! It's much faster to just change your mind and order from another restaurant for dinner.  My advice is get some more staff if the location is that busy! And please put one person in charge of taking calls."}
{"text":"Wonderful Lunch! all 4 of us were pleased and will return and recommend this location! Patrick, the man in charge was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"It's good food but over hyped. I've been eating Portuguese for years from Portuguese owned places and I like those better if I only compare the chicken. A lot of Portuguese places will use charcoal for their grilling, which adds a smokiness that Nando's lack.   Nando's does have its advantages. You can adjust the level of spiciness, and Nando's has more flavorful sides. Nando's has things a typical Portuguese restaurant might not have like wings or some African inspired stuff. But if I compare their main specialty - the chicken, I'd prefer most Portuguese places over Nando's.   This is especially true if I compare prices. Nando's is expensive and it's easy to see why. They spend so much on packaging. They have their Nando's paper take out bag. They have custom made take out boxes. They even have custom made sauce packets. A half chicken with 2 sides cost me $15.40 before taxes. At any Portuguese place, I'd probably pay 30-40% less, and the portions on the sides would be better. For this location, it's clear they spent a lot on decor too. As a foodie I don't really care that much about decor and packaging. I just want good food. Their food is good but when there's a price difference of 30-40% vs other Portuguese places, I definitely need to think twice about coming here. The taste isn't good or unique enough for me to justify paying this premium. Both Bairrada and Rooster King roast the chicken with more smokiness."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Nandos. I have always wanted to go but there aren't much Nando restaurants near me.   This was the one that was half way from where I live. So I decided to call one of my friends and head on over. As we walked in, the place is super casual, I felt like I was overdressed (LOL). When we got in, the ladies at the front greeted us and directed us to our seats. Once we sat down, the waiter told us the options on the menu and when we were ready we could come to the front desk to order and pay. Which was different, I thought we would just order from the table. But anyway, we ordered Peri Peri Chicken Wrap with Peri Peri Fries and 1/2 Peri Peri Chicken with Fries.   We got our order within 6-10 minutes which was pretty quick. The fries and wrap were delicious not at all oily. I would come back to try other things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"We traveled as a team of 25 people to Calgary and were fortunate enough to select Nandos as one of our meal options while there.  WOW!  Just a great experience for the entire team.  The communication from the Leslie was first class all the way, helping with menu options and having our meal ready and fully organized for pick-up when we arrived at the restaurant.  Now onto the food.  It was GREAT.  People raved about how good the chicken was.  And the sauces were perfect - familiar and exotic all at the same time.  The garlic mashed potatoes were delicious as were the rest of the sides.  Nandos is a place at the top of our list when we return to Calgary next year.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Nandos, everyone should experience this \"restaurant\" at least once( quotes because it's a little different from traditional restaurants, just go you'll see what I mean) chicken is full of flavour. nandos has a great peri-peri sauce, not over seasoned like other places that offer similar food. Garlic bread is also rather impressive, I know you're probably thinking it's hard to get that wrong, but you'd be surprised. If you're hungry, I recommend the half chicken with mashed potatoes. The mash is not overly salty and has a pretty even consistency. 4 stars because they changed the rice a few years back and I still haven't gotten over it."}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Thursday night. Had a bogo coupon for a quarter chicken + side. I feel this location is cozier and has a better atmosphere than the Markham Rd. location. The food is a bit tastier as well.  Food - 4.25/5 Ordered 2 quarter chickens with 2 sides (peri peri fries and garlic mashed potatoes) and 5 peri peri crusted wings. The wings were a bit on the salty side, but they were delicious and moist. I think if they served it with a lemon wedge to give it some acidity and cut the saltiness, the wings would have been perfect. The chicken legs were delicious as well, and the sides were good, but nothing special. I'm a big Nandos fan and enjoy most of their menu items. Love their chicken livers! All of their sauces on the chicken are good and you can add even more hot sauce/garlic sauce if you like, as they have a self serve section for sauces and condiments, cutlery, napkins etc.  Service - 5/5 There is very limited service at Nandos so they get a perfect score. How Nandos works if you're dining in is, you seat yourself and review the menu. When you're ready to order, you have to walk up the the cash, tell them which table number you're sitting at, place your order and pay. Then you go back to your table and they will bring your food to the table. Food came after a reasonable amount of time. Not much else to say here.  Value - 4/5 Prices are reasonable. I guess their biggest competitor is Swiss Chalet, which is a bit cheaper, but I feel like Nandos is slightly more higher end than eating at the Swiss. Nandos chickens are a bit smaller as well, but the flavours and taste are definitely way better. Overall, a good place for all things chicken whether you're dining in or taking out."}
{"text":"Love the garlic bread!! The chicken legs are sooo tender! Definitely will come more times"}
{"text":"Those who are veterans of the Nando's experience will find themselves more than at home here.  The décor is full of warm vibrant colours that provide a pleasant backdrop to the restaurant's Portuguese theme.  If you have never been to a Nando's before, then be sure to add this new location to your list of future eating establishments.   The simple and versatile nature of the menu is a welcome break from rigidly enforced culinary creations.  Their chicken is served in generous portions and it is cooked to perfection.  You have a choice of a number of different spice levels, ranging from fairly easy going to absolute mouth fire.  The Xtra Hot should only be attempted by the most avid spice enthusiast. Nando's has their own signature sauce, and it is as flavorful as it is spicy.  The fiery aroma comes as a welcome assault before the moist and prefect chicken can be enjoyed.  And enjoy it you will.  The South African owned, international chain has restaurants all over the planet.  Even as far as Qatar and Malaysia.  They are experts at grilling spicy, tender chicken for a growing audience that is completely enamored by their chicken."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 9:30 one evening. Was not greeted at all although a sign advised me to wait to be seated. Made my way to a cashier who showed me to a seat. Back to the cash to  order and pay and then back to my seat to wait for the food. Seems a convoluted system. Wonder how well it works at peak times?  Anyway, my 1/2 chicken with 2 sides came quite quickly. I then had to look for cutlery and napkins. Dispenser was out of both so had to get a staff member to procure them for me. Then I went to a machine to get my beverage. Might be smoother next time when I know the system.  No complaints on the food. Enjoyed the chicken, fries were crisp hot and nicely spiced and the coleslaw was standard. Ordered medium spice but could not detect much in the chicken. Did not seem like a big upgrade in food over something like Swiss Chalet and at a higher price point. Decor is nicer though. Cost around 20 bucks with tax and tip."}
{"text":"By far one of the few Portuguese restaurants that's great for dining in, not crazy expensive and casual enough to just drop in. Great food, wonderful atmosphere and plenty of street parking if you're early enough."}
{"text":"Well, I was there today for lunch. As a vegetarian I opted for the Veggie burger based on Chelsea K's review.  Sadly I didnt have as good an experience as she did.   A bit about the concept. You order at the register, they give you a number for your table and then deliver the food to you.  First the good: The restaurant had lots of nice banquette seating and was clean. The service was pleasant and relatively fast.  The bottles of Peri Peri sauces on the table was fun ( and tasty). The prices were reasonable. Now the not so good: Veggie Burger was very average... the bun it was on although very fresh was huge...far more bun that veggie patty.  The only toppings on the veggie burger were lettuce and a slice of tomato.   So essentially it felt like I was eating a bun with the rest as sort of an afterthought.   My friends had chicken and they thought it was good but one friend said  \"You cant really screw up grilled chicken\". That may or may not be true, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the whole  experience.  With the order at the counter concept and the quality of the food, it felt a bit like a  food court.  Chances are I wont be back. Sorry Nando."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken...but terrible service!  My last visit, the waitress spilled the coleslaw all over the table, my phone and my pants.  Accidents happen, but she didn't even apologize!  I was too hungry to care but I just thought that wasn't very good customer service.  The garlic peri-peri sauce made it all worthwhile....mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"The closest in atmosphere, taste and service you will find to the British Nando's. Look out for Vince, a fun personality and a great server! Thanks for making our experience great every time!   The food was so good we ate it for lunch and came back for dinner! Recommend this location to chicken lovers and workout fiends!  Flavourful chicken and quantity was definitely worth the experience.   After eating here I will never visit Markham and 14th Nando's!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place with my friend because I heard great things. The interior looked very nice!! I attached some pics. I was confused about how the process works though. There was no host, but seating. We went up to the cash area and we're asked if we'd like to sit and said yes so we grabbed a nice seating area, and I sat and waited to be served, but I was told that there were no servers here, you order at the cash and then the orders are brought to you. It was interesting, and at first I didn't get if, but after I didn't mind at all. You can get your own refills whenever you want, etc. And then we got the food. O M G! I got the half chicken (two chicken breasts) with two sides (potato wedges and casa salad) the chicken, even though it was white meat, was FANTASTIC. Not dry whatsoever. The potato wedges and salad were nothing out of the ordinary but still really good! You can also take your own piri piri dressing (mild, hot, and garlic) but they're all quite spicy! Good thing I like spicy. Overall this place was nice, affordable, and absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month! Although my child is a vegetarian we still fully enjoy the menu and I now have a new favourite item on the menu! The Holloumi cheese and portobello wrap! Best vegetarian dish I've ever had! I'm not one but it's so good that's what have.  But of course the chicken is amazing, and the Peri Peri sauce is why we come.  Usually, there is a line up, but don't be discouraged, it's worth the wait! Besides that should be a testament to how many people enjoy the food.    The structure was an old Pizza Hut, but about a year ago the remodelled and they must have hired a great designer because the facelift does not show any sign of the old \"hut\". Family dinning for sure, pretty relaxed. Never had an issue with the service, besides having to wait most times. But we love the food so much we know it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last winter and was shocked that the restaurant had cockroaches, no wonder it's so dim in there! One ran across our table and my dinner party was immediately disgusted. It was embarrassing for me as I took this group out and it left a bad impression. I also spotted a roach in the bathroom, and when informing the staff about the situation they did nothing. The food was alright, the salad I had was bland and didn't have any olive oil, and the chicken and rice was decent. Not sure if they still have a roach problem at this location, but I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for grilled chicken, there's no other place to go but here!  Always a good time coming here! Wait time is fair, even when it's busy, your food comes pretty quick still! There are a wide variety of hot sauces to choose from! The last time I came here they just installed a new frozen yogurt machine! Although, it would be nice to have other options than just one flavour. They also had a new soda machine with lots of drinks to choose from, the darn machine has a touch screen with menu, crazy!  If you haven't been here before you should try it out! Fair price for lots to eat!"}
{"text":"This Nando's has been recently renovated and looks much nicer than it did before.    Not all Nando's are created equal.  I have eaten at some terrible ones around the world.  I have also eaten at great ones.  This one is on the good side.  Their new cash point system is a little flaky so check your order to be  sure.. However the food is tasty and  the staff will hustle.  Perhaps my only complaint is something endemic to calgary.  When I ask for extra spicy, I want to feel the burn."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my colleagues and did not know how popular Nandos was.  Place is busy during lunchtime on weekdays and does not take reservations. We were seated very quickly though. Very cute dining room. Not luxurious but comfortable enough. Food was excellent. Quarter Chicken (leg & thigh) was juicy and tender here.   They take the orders a different way: you have to go to the counter and make orders, mention your table number, and they will bring food to you. I was bothered by the fact that they charge pre-tip in advance. I always tip but if I don't know what service I am going to get here, how should I determine the tip amount? I tipped 15% anyways. Great thing that all the staff we encountered were very attentive and polite. However I still find this pre-tip practice a bit counter-intuitive and may turn some people off.   To conclude I still enjoyed my experience here. Was just slightly annoyed by their tip practice."}
{"text":"I love Nando's periperi chicken!  The food here is delicious and consistent with other Nando's I've been to, including one in the UK.  Recommend their spicy periperi sauce if you can handle it. I love spicy food. Would probably just drink the sauce straight from the bottle if I could. Anyways it makes the chicken from good to good-er. Thumbs up.  Also along with ordering your chicken, make sure to try out some of their sides. I like the periperi fries and periperi potato wedges. But really, just anything with periperi is good.  Minus one point because the portion you get for the price you pay is whack - chickens are mighty small. However, the taste and periperi spices here are so good that you can ignore this and just go anyway."}
{"text":"Ever wondered what east african-portugese fusion would taste like? Ya either have I, but nandos proves that it is delicious. Nandos is flame grilled chicken served with a peri peri sauce (a sauce made with African bird`s eye chili).   The grilled chicken has a nice smokey flavour but what really elevates it is the sauce. They have sauces ranging from mild to extra hot. I usually go for the hot which has a nice lemony taste with a good kick from the chili. The sides are pretty standard (rice, salad, fries) I am a fan of their rice, and the peri fries are also quite good. My only knock against the food is that their portions are rather small, so if you have a big appetite like me go for the half chicken with 2 sides or a double leg dinner.   The place is very casual, you order at the counter, seat yourself and your food is brought to you once it is ready. They price is reasonable, you will end up spending 10-15 dollars depending on how much chicken and how many sides you wish to have. The restaurant itself is quite clean and modern looking (they had renovations done last year) and they have a few locations throughout the GTA. This place is definitely a good alternative to swiss chalet or any dirty bird franchise around."}
{"text":"Been to Nando's quite a few times. Everytime I get a hankering for some South African food (nostalgic) I drop by this Nando's location. And ever time, the service is slow. But it's really all about the chicken. And if you don't get hot or extra hot, I wouldn't hold it against you. I prefer mild (lemon garlic) since I like to taste what I'm eating without having to hose my mouth down. My favourite dish is the chicken liver with a Portuguese bun. Try it, you won't be disappointed. General observations: Order and pay at the counter. No biggie I suppose, but I always find it odd when the credit card machine asks how much tip you want to add, when they've actually haven't done anything for you yet.  You'll get a number which you can then take to your table and after a little patience, they'll find you and bring you your order. Good food once you actually get it!"}
{"text":"PROS: 1. The chicken is smokey, spicy, juicy, and basically... to die for! The sides (potato wedges, salad) compliment the chicken as well.   2. I went to eat there after a loooong day at the Zoo, thus the food tasted immaculate. Perhaps biasing my review? Either way, it was still delicious!!  3. Atmosphere of the restaurant is like a hybrid of fast food and dine-in. I'd say it's good for casual eats but not a birthday.  CONS: 1. Service was not impressive. The cashier lady was pretty short with us and it seemed like she didn't want to be there.  OVERALL:  -I would definitely recommend it -Next time I go I'll buy a bottle of their sauce to take home -Much yummier than KFC"}
{"text":"On a rainy and cold day last week, I had a mighty hankering for some roasted chicken that wasn't Swiss Chalet. So I went to its more exotic and better tasting brother Nando's for some takeout.  This was actually my first time trying their roasted chicken as I've always gotten the chicken livers (~$13) before. This is the only place I know that serves them in nice saucy chunks that you can soak up with some firm Portuguese buns. After reading some other reviews on how succulent the chicken was, I decided to give that a go this time around.   Because I am what people call \"a baby\" and I don't like mixing pain with food, I never get the spicy options. The Lemon & Herb half chicken (~$15 with two sides) had a pretty nice grill flavour on top but as with most roasted chickens, it gets kind of bland in the centre. Luckily, Nando's has got you covered with a myriad of Peri-Peri sauces. I was a big fan of the slightly sour, slightly spicy Garlic sauce. The meat itself was quite tender. As for my two sides, the Peri-Peri fries were really good with that garlic sauce and the grilled veggies were freshly prepared.   Unfortunately, the price to portion is not the greatest value even though it's quality chicken. For the price that is paid, there are better options out there. I heard they also recently raised prices. Another slight issue is the long wait. Even though we were getting take out, it took a good 30 minutes between the order and us leaving the restaurant. The food was really fresh so it wasn't the biggest problem but I do suggest you call ahead, especially at dinner time.   Even with the small problems, every time someone says chicken, I'll say Nando's! Their food is fresh, hot, and pretty tasty. But next time, I think I'll stick with those fantastic chicken livers.

{"text":"I've been to this Nando's location twice and was satisfied with each visit.  The seating arrangment is vast and plentiful, they have an ammazziinngg drink machine, and many varieties of sauce flavours to add to your meal.  During my latest visit,  I ordered their whole wheat chicken wrap. It was good; tasted like there was some sort of honey mustard sauce, contained a variety of chopped veggies, and all white chicken breast pieces. After having a bite or 2, I felt the wrap needed a little more flavour,  so I decided to add a bit of the garlic piri-piri sauce which made it much tastier! I ordered a side of their piri-piri friea as well which were very tasty!  I also tries their mashed potatoes (would highly recommend)  and their potato wedges (I've definitely had better potato wedges in my life).   I will probably return sonetime next year.... Not something I'm dying to come back to.  Very Good, but not great."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice location and plenty of parking spots. And hot sauce bottles overload! The restaurant itself is not that big, but it can accommodate a big group if it's not crowded already. Food arrived fairly quickly and staff was nice. Great overall!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on Friday night. We were a party of nine and could not reserve a table, but my friend managed to snag one of the cooler tables with colourful bead curtains. Great location as you're only a block away from College Station; I was going to drive initially, but opted to ride the rocket instead. The ambiance is quite casual as it's cafeteria style. Once you decide on what you want, you up to the counter and order your meal.   The menu is quite extensive and there's something for everyone. A little random, but they have all you can eat froyo on their menu. After looking at the menu, I decided on the double chicken skewers (2 sticks) with two sides (veggies and garlic mash). I've been spoiled with authentic mom and pop Portuguese chicken so I found my meal to be a-ok. Portion size was not too big; considering their specialty is chicken, I found it to be quite dry. My sides were also okay; they were a little salty. I thought the bottomless pop from the machine was pretty neat; you can choose any pop with various flavours .... Orange Coke, Cherry Coke, Raspberry Coke etc.  For a casual dinner with a group of people, Nando's is a good choice. Everyone can eat chicken.  Good for: groups, casual dining"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. Ordered take out they lost my order and clearly saw I was standing there for about 15 minutes while customers behind me were getting there food"}
{"text":"It is a must do. Health food and an unique mix of South African and Portuguese spirits. Music is great."}
{"text":"came here for the first time through a recommendation of a friend  the interior of the restaurant is very cute and colourful and the lounge is comfortable to sit in  never being here before I found out you have to order at the front and grab sauces that you want that I found unique  I got the medium heat 1/4 chicken and my boyfriend got the lemon and herb one we also got Cajun fries and pop at first   when it arrived it was what I expected but a little smaller but my boyfriend said it was a very small  portion for what he paid and proceeded to rant oh my . he went to order rice as well. then he came back and said the cashier was rude because he seemed like he was half asleep and didn't know the answers to his questions.   the food arrived quickly. the rice was very unique different than any other rice I've tasted. it was yellow and had some veggies and a harder texture I would give the rice 3/5 as it was just average   the Cajun fries were yummy and thick cut. had a nice Cajun spice to it to give it a good flavour 3.5/5 better than average   the chicken was super good. it surprised me how moist it was and the skin fell off the bone. the sauce and spice was perfect and had a tangy flavour. the lime one was more sour but still had that kick of spice. I find it interesting that they put sauce on a chicken but have lots of sauce at the front. perhaps you should get the plain chicken then you can add whatever sauces you want yourself. overall the chicken is a 4/5 because it is quite expensive for what you get   overall I would recommend this to people who can handle spice as it gets spicier the more you eat and like chicken. also you can use SPC if you have it but I forgot to use mine  would I come here again? probably but only once in a while by boyfriend said he is never coming again tho hahah"}
{"text":"Went for an office team lunch to this place that is just a block away.  They weren't able to keep their promise of sitting us all at the same table when we made reservations earlier in the week.  This is because their tables are bolted down.  The grilled chicken was the highlight as advertised and combined with their wide selection of puri-puri sauces are really tasty but I would stay away from the grilled veggies and stick with getting the more traditional sides such as mashed potatoes and corn.  The puri-puri sauces get real hot, real fast so be careful and don't overestimate your tastebuds. :)  The grilled puri-puri veggies were overdone and felt like they had been sitting in a pan for a while.  Drinks are dispensed from the all-in-one super Coke machine which is kind of neat.  The restaurant atmosphere has a lot of african art and knick-knacks and the seating arrangement is a mix between sit-down conversation dining places to the food-court type seating for quick power lunch meals.  This spot is more suited for power lunches during the weekday from work and less for a long dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly, if I was rating the food, it would be in the 4 star range. It was pretty tasty I have to say.  I ordered a lemon & herb whole chicken with peri peri fries. SO TASTY. Chicken definitely tasted \"flame grilled\" and the fries were hot, crisp and flavourful. Really good.   The main problem is the atmosphere/the location itself. Came here for dinner, and immediately when you walk in, it was pretty hectic. The restaurant itself is kind of small. There's a mix and match of different kind of seats; one side booth seating, curvey corner booth couches, cloth seats and metal chairs.   Since this is a \"eat with your hands\" kind of place, anything cloth is stained and nasty. My seat was pretty gross; it had seen some better days. I don't get why they don't just use all metal seats so you can wipe and clean things up better? Booth seats are the vinyl material so I guess they're clean-ish. Also there are no napkins you can get yourself - you have to ask for them???... Guess that's why the seats are dirty.   Maybe it was just because I went and had bad luck, but the other patrons that come here, that looked like they've been here before made the experience a little worse...You've got some late teenagers/super early 20 something year olds talking loudly about credit scores and their grand plans for their future/get successful quick schemes, a family with like 8 kids (I'm not kidding I think I only saw 2 adults, and the rest were children), and other people kind of standing around clueless watching you eat/letting their kids run around.   Overall, good food, could use a good cleaning, and bad crowd."}
{"text":"I was well happy in the car with my friend Terry as I thought we were heading to my favourite Pho place for dinner. As we were nearing the restaurant though, Terry turns and says \"How about we try Nandos?\". I hesitated for a moment but then agreed (I used to have Nandos once a week back in Australia so I assumed I was in for a treat).That ended up being a terrible decision.  My chicken sandwich was bland and flavourless, the fries were OKAY at best. Terry offered me some of his wedges and they were drier then the Sahara Desert.  I would not eat here again and any Australians/English people reading this review and thinking \"I wonder if Nandos tastes the same in Canada as it does back home?\"   It doesn't"}
{"text":"My friend Libby recommended Nando's.  She enjoyed the food at Nando's Chicago during a recent trip.  I was in Toronto and found out that there were several Nando's in Ontario.   The restaurant is Portuguese with southeast African influences. The peri peri spice comes from the African birds eye chilli. The first nandos opened in Johannesburg in 1987. The decor of the restaurant is South African to pay homage to their roots.  The decor was interesting and comfortable.  The South African motif definitely put me in the mood to enjoy the Peri Peri Chicken.  I ordered the quarter pound Chicken with Wings and Breast.  I selected the Spicy Rice and Nando's Vegetables for my sides.  The Chicken was moist and definitely flavorful.  I alternated between dipping the Chicken in the medium hot and extra hot Peri Peri sauce - available to grab and bring to your table.  The sides complemented the Chicken well.   As a dare, our group also ordered the Roulette Chicken wings - at least one or more of the Chicken wings is super spicy.  It was fun to see who got the super spicy wings.  Nando's was great for lunch.  Good food, great decor and a fun element to share with friends and family - Roulette Chicken.  Nando's also had a few decent veg options for friends and family who do no partake in Chicken.  I definitely recommend Nando's as a fun and interesting place for lunch or perhaps dinner."}
{"text":"Came in here to try. But never coming back again. Especially after the price we paid for such a small amount of food. Not worth it. Go to Churrasco Portugril and try them instead.  If it costs 30$+ for such little food, I can put my money towards a better meal."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I love Nando's and I love their peri-peri sauce even more! It's hard for me to go anywhere else in this plaza when I know Nando's has some gooood chicken just waiting to be eaten!  They have some great combos as well... \"Meals to Share.\" My usual order is: Variety Pack - 1/2 chicken, 2 kebabs, 8 wings and 2 regular sides OR Nando's Familia - 1 chicken, 2 kebabs, 1 large side, 1 reg. side and 1 large salad WITH an extra side order or 2 of peri peri chips, coleslaw, corn and baked potato. (minus  whichever is ordered with the meal).  Devan is right when he says its overpriced for what you get, the value could definitely be better - but loyal Nando's customers don't mind. I usually spend about $40-50 for two people here for a seriously satisfying meal. Definitely not the greatest value, but for me an amazingly satisfying meal. I think they put something in their sauce. Once I start I just can't stop."}
{"text":"Why haven't I come here in so long, and why haven't I written a review for this place yet?  So when someone mentions Nando's to me, it usually brings up pretty fond memories of dining my family and with my friends in Dubai. This place is a huge chain that's peppered through East Africa and the Middle East. Flame Grilled Portuguese chicken married with east african bird's eye chili's..for the masses (so it's not super spicy.) (I once had a really horrible experience with the bird's eyes that involved me not being able to take my hands out of ice cold water for two days)   Anyways, past time's I've been here I've been really underwhelmed. The Canadian version is missing a few key elements that I'm used to, but that can just be attributed to the fact that Dubai does everything way over the top.  Anyways, I came back here a few days ago with my friend who really had the same memories I did, and wanted to check it out.  We decided to get the sharable plate for 2 (or 3 I guess) which had  1) The Whole Chicken - I guess they use the term \"whole\" quite loosely, but it came with two leg quarters and two breast pieces. The legs were really good, but I was sooo surprised with the breasts! They were PERFECTLY juicy and stuff. OMG. I was expecting  dryness because honestly I don't think I've ever had bbq breast that wasn't dry. SO GOOD. We ordered it medium because my friend was scared, but it wasn't spicy So good though.  2. Large Side - We got the peri peri fries. It was really good fries tossed in a peri peri salt. Yummy.  3. The Garlic Bread - SO GOOD. It may look like a small portion from the pic but that's because we devoured half of them before the other food came. SO GOOD.  4. The sauces were AMAZING. My favourite was the Xtra Hot and the Garlic Sauce. Soooo good.    This place is a lot better than it was before. There were a lot more serviers and people working this time than what I remember, so I guess business is booming! They had a pretty steady stream of customers while we were there (around 6.30 on a Thursday night)  We were definitely full for the rest of the day.  Will defo be back  (We paid approx 32 with tax + tip sans drinks)"}
{"text":"Over priced swiss chalet with hot sauce. Nvm, I actually like Swiss Chalet chicken better.. and ooooh the gravy."}
{"text":"Kind of like swiss chalet. the sauce was the highlight. I ended up buying a bottle of sauce so when I made my own chicken I just pour some of that on top. yum."}
{"text":"I imagine their chicken here is quite good, but as I ease into full pesco-vegetarianism I actually just ended up ordering the veggie options for my partner and me. We were both super disappointed with Nando's tonight for 2 reasons-  1. They ran out of so many ingredients and veggie options. The corn was not available, but understandable since \"out of season\", but they were also out of grilled pineapples, the veggie sandwich, and the \"portobello mushroom with halloumi cheese and chilli jam\" sandwich. So my partner ended up ordering his 3rd choice - the veggie wrap - and upon delivery of the food he was told that they also ran out of one of the vegetables that is usually in the wrap. Please stock up your inventory soon, Nando's.   2. The veggie options sucked. I don't think I have super high standards for food, not a food snob or anything, but the sad presentation/discrepancy from advertised photos and oil drenched, flavorless grilled veggies were truly disappointing. I ordered the quinoa salad, which looked amazing in a few existing Yelp photos, but tonight it was so sparse and sad looking :( There wasn't enough seeds on top and overall the quantity was much smaller than it appeared in the photos. The toppings also looked sloppily chopped and presented. I could've easily made this salad in 2 minutes myself.  The upsides-  1. No issues with seating immediately after arriving since the restaurant is so large (they also have huge communal tables -- great for groups!) 2. Friendly service 3. Relatively fast for food to arrive -- we had to wait around 15 minutes, which I guess is not bad considering the volume of customers"}
{"text":"Coming back from Nando's just now, Nando's is a great place to go to up until you get a table for 6 and while you wait for your friends to arrive while already ordering a beer and looking at the menu sitting at my designated table 20, a rude waitress comes up to the table and RUDELY ask \"when is your other guest coming\" and you respond \"soon\" followed by her condescending \"You can't do that\" with her almost threatening to take my table away with a \"I'll come check on your table again soon\" in an unprofessional manner that I deem condescending and rude. I understand that the place was getting packed but for a waitress to threaten to take my table away (while I was ALREADY drinking a beer AND I was there because I wanted to make sure I got a freaking table) made none of the food for me taste one bit good because her mannerism literally overshadowed anything I have to say good about the venue. Heard great things about the place but came that Friday night, was unimpressed at the hospitality. As an SEO Specialist, you can bet I will be posting more negative feedbacks across many mainstream review platforms."}
{"text":"Staff: \"hello! have you been to nando's before? First of all, I've been to Nando's more than you've been to Nando's.  Nando's is a great spot for grilled chicken - basically a swiss chalet that doesn't taste like overpriced shit. Having been to better nando's location, I found this one extremely chaotic and dirty. The atmosphere just didn't do it for me, even for a chill meal spot. The restaurant looked like a bunch of restaurants put together, none of the decor/chairs/booths matched. The back looked like a babysitter's club. I like the individual washrooms though they were a bit dirty as well. The chairs looked like someone had a very rough time on them. Cloth chairs and no napkins aren't a great combo anywhere.. stains from who knows how long ago. Kind of unappetizing.. good thing I only saw that at the end..  This nando's was very populated/busy - many people in and out every few minutes, mostly for takeout. Then more things to ruin the atmosphere.. such as this large trashy family with probably 2 adults dragged around 8 toddlers in and demanded to be seated all together, even when the manager said \"even when the restaurant is empty, we don't have a table for 10\" .. whose mans brings in 10 people to ANY restaurant without calling in first and demands to be seated. Lucky us- they got seated next to us and we had screaming, sticky children kicking and running around for half our meal. It's a very family-oriented restaurant so expect a bunch of that.  In terms of service, we had to ask for water/napkins.. basics. Other than that, food came quickly and they were generally nice. We ordered the classic shareplatter which came with a whole chicken, a large side (peri peri fries) and garlic bread. Carb overload!!! Most of their sides include an abundance of carbs - even the vegetables (c'mon.. corn??) so beware. The fries were crispy, hot and fresh.. it was a bit salty but definitely a great cheat snack! The chicken however- best. Sooooo good, grilled so it's extra lean and an easy way to get in that protein for the day. It had so much flavour in every bite and definitely worth it. We dipped it in the garlic sauce, which was great and hella spicy. 10/10 would get again.  I also saw on the menu that they had bottomless froyo.. I think the machine was broken though- but that is DANGEROUS! Definitely want it."}
{"text":"Boring. You get grilled chicken and some sauces. Might as well get a rotisserie chicken from safeway and buy the nando hot sauces. Save you a lot of money."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was our first and last visit here. The staff doesn't have a service model that they can excel with in the first place, (i.e., sit down, be told to look at the menu and then go to the cash and place your order, go over there and get your cutlery, get a glass and get water if you want water) but it would have been nice to be told after waiting and asking 3 people for the drink I'd ordered that they had 'forgotten'  that I had to make a third trip to the cutlery station to get dressing for the salad they'd just plunked down. The manager or head server tried to make up for it by offering us free pastries - we didn't want pastries. We just wanted to be served what we ordered and informed ahead of time about getting our own dressing and condiments. The salad wasn't fresh and the chicken was dry. Zero training and concept about focusing on the customer's experience - what does the customer really want, not what Nando's thinks they want, it appears. I'm already wondering what will replace it in this space."}
{"text":"Perfectly done Chicken. Peri peri livers extra well done was perfect. Better than back home in SA. Chicken is done from scratch. Not dry. Flavourful! Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. I have tried the grilled chicken livers and half chicken. It tastes good and authentic. My only problem is with their service and portions. They can work on a better service and cleanliness. Overall worth a try."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place if your looking to eat somewhere casual but not as casual as fast food. They have good grilled chicken with of course their famous peri peri sauce. The portion of the plates are inadequate for it's price.. For a half chicken plate with two small sides cost about $20.  The extra hot peri peri sauce is extremely hot for those spice lovers! Definitely a place to try but not sure if it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I've tried Nandos a handful of times and always thought the food was good, but a fairly small portion for the price.  It wasn't until I tried the double lime and mango skewers that I changed my opinion. I find it's the best sized meal for the money and is the only thing I want to order off the menu.  I went to Nandos at Bay and College last week to find that my one favourite thing to order had not been delivered that day due to a problem with their supply chain.  The manager was close by when I was attempting to order an offered some of the best customer service I've had in a resturant in a long time. They helped me pick something else out that was similar. I ended up having a chicken breast and a side and was very happy with my food.    I still think the prices are a little high for the portions, but good customer service and delicious food keeps bringing me back to this location."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food! Just delicious and I love how you can choose your level of spiciness. I miss working in the Northeast where this location was convenient."}
{"text":"Had take out from Nando's yesterday. The 2 chicken legs were nice and spicy (ordered that way) and stayed hot. The rice pilaf was excellent, although just a bit overcooked...the grain had swollen too much. But the chicken is excellent....I wondered what it would taste like cold.....  This is now my 'non-fried' \"chicken of record\". Tasty!"}
{"text":"Don't get the green beans, they made me cringe on impact with my tongue. Lets just say they love their mint.  The chicken was OK...thank the lord its not an arm and a leg because you could taste the flame & propain more then their great spices on the chicken. I had to baptize the thing in sauce.   The staff is very friendly on the plus side and the place has a great vibe inside. Not the number one choice for me moving forward, however."}
{"text":"Always great! Delicious peri peri chicken. Huge portions and hearty food. Everything is self serve-get as many sauces as you want! Service is super fast. One of my favourite places to come with a big group."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the chicken but it was dry and all the flavour came from the sauces you had to grab from the side counter. However, the biggest turn off was the lack of clean utensils at the side counter and there was literally no one you could flag down or speak to at the cash register regarding replenishing."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone would come here for chicken...... it's so plain and dry and poorly done......"}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives next to it so we are always here always super busy but fast. I love their chicken pita, their mashed potatoes and the rice. The natas are okay but the nandos kisses chocolate ice cream is pretty good. You can get any kind of coke (cherry/vanilla, etc). They sell a really good Rosé wine ! Also they serves are very friendly and Carmen was really helpful with her advice."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness Nando, where have you been all my life?!  I needed to go downtown with a coworker today for a meeting so we popped in here for lunch first. I've heard about Nando's from following The Body Coach on Instagram but just assumed it was a U.K. chain.   We arrived at approximately 12:30pm and although the restaurant was busy, we were seated quickly at a long, family-style table. The decor was kinda funky and extremely inviting.   We both opted for the Quinoa Salad with Peri Peri Chicken (add-on) and headed up to the counter to place our orders.   After grabbing our cutlery and drinks we head to our seat to wait for our food. It wasn't long before we were presented with the most beautiful and delicious looking salad!  A few bites in and I knew we'd picked a winner! My lunch companion had been to Nando's before so she knew to grab the extra bottle of Peri Peri Garlic Sauce. OMG. And I thought it couldn't get any better!! I think our stomachs were high-fiving each other!  The service was great, the food was fabulous and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Although it's not the same as the locations in London, UK the food is still very good. The location is decorated in a very fun way and it is a fun place to sit down with friends and family. The staff have been friendly also the times I've visited this Calgary location."}
{"text":"First time eating here on Saturday and the place was impressive in size and seating. Not bad on the interior decor too. Anyway the food was good! I loved the peri peri chicken and fries! A must order! But I must say, if your eating with someone, just get the whole chicken instead of ther 1/2. Better in price wise and portion.   I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been here both with a big group and just me and my hubby and there seems to be a difference in the quality of the chicken between the two.   With a big group we always get the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) lemon herb with the Portuguese garlic bread, Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice. We order and pay at the cashier then they deliver the food to our table. The chicken has always been hot, juicy and flavorful while the sides complemented the chicken well in taste and freshness.   Eating here with my hubby we ordered the 1/2 chicken (which was actually two 1/4 chickens) with lemon herb which was a little on the dry side but still tasty. For the sides we had the appetizer platter with the roasted red pepper dip which came with pita, 3 grilled wings (tender and juicy) and the Portuguese garlic bread. The red pepper dip was salty but the garlic bread which was grilled was delicious. The bread was even better when dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   TIPS:  Come with a large group   If you come with a small group order the 1/4 chicken (leg and thigh) or wings to make sure your chicken is not dried out.  For sides, get the grilled Portuguese garlic bread (make sure to dip it in some oil and vinegar), Casa salad with oil and vinegar and spiced rice."}
{"text":"Surprisingly enough, when we came here on a Friday early evening, there were still a few tables left for our group of 4. After getting seated, you choose what you'd like from the menu, then go up to the front to order and pay. We ordered the family pack so that we'd all get to try a few different things from their menu. It was around $40 for a chicken, 2 skewers, 2 large sides and garlic bread or 2 Portuguese buns.  The food came relatively quickly and we didn't notice this until a few hours after our meal, but our family platter was missing the 2 chicken skewers. For the peri-peri sauce, we chose plain since someone in our table didn't eat spicy foods. The peri-peri vegetables were subpar, with lots of onions in it. The garlic bread was delicious and the potato wedges were seasoned perfectly. The chicken itself was very tender, juicy, and well seasoned.  The place itself was very loud, possibly because it was a Friday night. There isn't really service, since you don't have a set server throughout the meal. Was quite disappointed about their missing food (the skewers), but I might come back another day to try it another try anyhow."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeee this place. Specially this location.  I HATE CHICKEN LIVER.     I have tried it in soo many different way possible and still hate the texture. But when i go to Nando's all i order iS LIVER. OMG i dream about the taste sometimes hahahhaha so lame i know i know. But its the most delicious thing i have tried."}
{"text":"very poorly run business. came here for lunch with my employees. They had no veggies. coffee machine was broken. the draft beer was also broken. Wi-Fi didn't work. when i travel i depend on yelp to enjoy my vacation so I just want to let people know my experience. stay away !!!"}
{"text":"I came to Nando's with two coworkers during lunchtime on a weekday. You go up to the counter to order, but servers assist you with seating and bring your meal to the table. It's a very casual setting, and quite fast.  I really, really like the chicken (not dry at all) and the spicy rice. I am also a big fan of the sweet potatoes. They have a variety of sauces (different spice levels) which are good."}
{"text":"First time there. Went for take-out at supper time.  Too long a wait for my order to be taken. Too long a wait to get my order. When I got home, I was shocked and disappointed upon opening the meal containers. They must buy their chicken from a former Nazi concentration camp judging by the amount of meat on the leg and thigh I was given. The garlic mashed potatoes amounted to about three mouthfuls. OK.... you got me this time, Nando's but you will never get me again.   I am not interested in food that is burnt because eating charcoal is not good for you.  I fail to understand the rave reviews for a fast-food place that delivers so little for far too much money."}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken sandwich was really good and the lemon and herb spice was really flavorful. Really hits the spot. Nice decor too. Would have been 4 stars except...  The service was terrible. I was alright with paying upfront including tip, though I was hesitant how much to tip because I hadn't gotten the food yet. However, the waitress charged us $1 more on a combo for no reason whatsoever. They also offered pineapple and cheese on the sandwich and never mentioned that they were each an extra dollar.  Would come again for the food, but definitely not worth it for the bad service."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Worst Nandos location in the entire Toronto. First they screwed up our order, made us wait for over 20 minutes and then started yelling at us because we were getting anxious. The manager tried to cover up for it later by offering free coupons but my appetite was gone by then. Go to any other location but not this one."}
{"text":"Except for the immediate barrage of questions upon entering, (are you staying or going? Where will you be sitting?), this was a lovely experience. The quality of the food is certainly excellent, and the price is also very reasonable. Staff are helpful; I like to get as much bang as possible for my buck, and the man who took my order was helpful in finding out how many ounces of meat were in each dish we discussed. Looking forward to a return visit, and recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"What is it about this place that excites people so much? I like chicken, I like marinaded chicken, I like spicy chicken...but this place didn't impress me. I had the peri peri chicken wrap with fries, it was medium peri. NOT spicy at all, if you want something with a kick go for the hot.  My wrap/pita was 6.50 and i didn't think it was worth the money at all.  On top of everything, there was very limited seating, with no space to even stand by the front counter. I don't mind busy restaurants but this one was just awkward, i didn't know which way to move because right or left I would have ended up molesting a child or an older person accidentally (?)....  Next time I will definitely order a whole chicken or something because the wrap wasn't enough, I would have gladly gone for McDonald's after this!   PS they have beer...if you like to casually wash your chicken down with some brewski :D"}
{"text":"I used to go here back in the late 90's after highschool basketball practice. My palette was a little less refined at the time, but I use to love their chicken and the hot sauce that it came with.  Fast forward to over a decade later, a Nando's restaurant has just opened at College and Bay. I had to go check it out and see if it still stacked up to the memory I had of it.   Since my highschool days, I've had Churrasqueiras from many restaurants in Little Portugal, and the real deal when I travelled to Lisbon, so it didn't come as a surprise that Nando's wasn't as good as I remember, however, it wasn't bad. The sauce isn't as good as authentic peri peri sauce, but the chicken was very moist, and cooked perfectly. So, if you're in the college park area, and you need a quick fix of roast chicken, it'll do in a pinch. It's better than swiss chalet, or a chicken you'd get at Longo's."}
{"text":"I remember Nando's from my days in Vancouver. I remember it being this succulent, spicy chicken.  While the restaurant is very big and can accommodate groups, the food is a disappointment. Tiny chicken pieces. Dry chicken. Not as spicy as desired (even though you select the spice level) and the spice, on the other hand, overly spicy!  Now that I have piri piri at home, I can make my succulent, spicy chicken. Buh-bye Nando's!"}
{"text":"Chicken was tasty You have to get up to order and get your own silverware and whatnot. Not a problem- but you should know."}
{"text":"Gave 2 stars cause of the food. Service was horrible and staff seemed to have attitude. Kept subtracting from the tip, Not coming back here again 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I absolutely love chicken and they have these booths where you have beads dangling over top you.   I wouldn't necessary come here all the time, but it's easy to make reservations for a large amount people.  Their chicken is tender and their sauce is ... there are no words. If you like spicy (and REALLY like spicy) then this place is for you. You can either get your chicken milk, hot, or really hot, or you can add the hot sauce yourself.   They also have unlimited drinks and frozen yogurt for dessert (which I still have yet to try and eat a tub).  It's also one of those coke machines that have all the different flavors you think no body would try, but you would end up trying them.  I would recommend this place for a large group of people as it has an amazing ambiance, but not for a date. Still love the chicken (AND HOT SAUCE)."}
{"text":"The food taste good, and the staff are very polite and friendly but the restaurant is not clean. Food rests on the tables, floor and the washrooms dirty."}
{"text":"Yay it's Nandos!  When I was new to this area, I went almost weekly... My appetite increased the more I came. You start at 1/4 Chicken, then 1/2 Chicken, and basically end up ordering a whole chicken for yourself! Hehe:) Nowadays, I visit occasionally. The ambience and decor is much better than Swiss Chalet. Spacious with lovely cozy booths. I've been here with larger groups (16 ppl) and they were very accommodating.  The chicken is alright... It's the sauces that make it yummy!!! Make sure you cover it in your favourite sauce, you'll be bringing bottles to your table. As for side dishes, peri-peri wedges or fries are best. The rice is good. I find the coleslaw over dressed. I stopped liking their mixed vegetables. The wrap is pretty good too.  It is definitely a go-to spot if you're in the neighbourhood.   Tip: Peri-peri everything!! Your fries, your chicken, get it all.  Extra savvy tip: Once, I was here with some friends who decided to pack their chicken bones home, to make chicken broth."}
{"text":"I have been to this Nando's thrice now, and all three times the service has been excellent, the staff are very friendly, and the service is quite speedy. Their chicken is very flavourful as well as their sauces, sometimes a bit too flavourful for my personal taste. Their Nando's Kisses is a great time if you like your sweets like me. The atmosphere is very casual, great with friends. Overall, I would definitely return and recommend this location."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty unique, and the location is really easy-access. The price is reasonable, and the service is great. The main menu gives you a good variety of taste, spice, and food to choose. There are also few options for dessert which are not very appealing though."}
{"text":"Came here late night on Sunday. It was my third visit to this place. We ordered a whole chicken and fries and mashed potatoes to share. The chicken was good - soft and tender however the fries were measley for $3.80 and tasted like it's been sitting out all day."}
{"text":"Folks who go to Nando's love the sauce. Once you go in there and take a bite, you are hooked to it. My wife and I are fans of this place. The food (chicken breast, the corn, the sweet potatoes) are petty nice. What I really hate about this place is the service. The left over plates stay on for a long time, the folks are unaware about where you are sitting. The washrooms are messy. I ordered a coffee too and they forgot about it. I am not sure if the reason for this poor service is because they charge you for food first (including the tip). I personally feel that this does not incentivize the staff. At one end, the management want to make it a sit down restaurant and on the other extreme, they want you to place the order like a McDonald or Tim Hortons. I am returning to this place? Yes, for sure. I just want to make sure that the readers are aware of the expectations. The"}
{"text":"I tried this place a little while ago.  I ordered the wrap and was very disappointed with what I got.  It was puny and definitely not worth the price.  I ended up eating half of what my gf ordered.  The chicken is good, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've been into this Portuguese inspired restaurant/take away several times, typically for a late weekday dinner with the family. It has always been a consistent choice and I've found the chicken to be a very good value/portion for the price. The chicken is always fresh, moist and tasty and the standard sides are a good apron to the chicken. I do, however recommend coming here with at least a couple people so that you can share a whole chicken and some sides."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants when I travel, there are over 1000 locations world wide, and you can never go wrong with Nandos, a African/Portuguese restaurant known for grilled chicken in various marinades, and accompanied by some flavourful hot sauces, and a choice of lots of sides, I always get a platter for 2 to 6 people, the chicken comes in different spice levels, and grilled to perfection. The sides my family really likes are the peri fries, garlic bread, corn on the cob(seasonal) and I get the chicken livers in extra hot for myself. Not a fan of chicken livers anywhere, but love the ones at Nandos. And the side sauce that is the best is \"Garlic\". The food is always 5 stars, why I gave it 4 is the service can be slow, and they try to make it fast food, but try to service it as a more fine restaurant. Most locations you help yourself to the sauces and drinks and condiments. It is a must try if you haven't already tried Nandos!"}
{"text":"I know this restaurant from living in South Africa, which is where the sauce peri-peri comes from, well Mozambique to be exact.  So I was very excited to find a Nando's in Calgary while I was visiting my brother.  It did not disappoint.  The sauce is amazing.  I love that their hot sauce, actually means hot, not some watered down version of hot sauce.  But for the more faint of pallets, they have milder sauces.  They grill their chicken, it is very lean and juicy. You can get just chicken or chicken sandwich on Portuguese bread or in a pita. I also recommend the peri fries.  It was nice to know that Nando's, even far from home, still is delicious."}
{"text":"Don't let the 2 star fool you. The chicken, the peri peri fries and those Portuguese rolls are bomb. And within an hour it all came out...but not through the rear exit. My friend also went home with an upset stomach and runny shits.   I feel like my experience was a one time thing. But for some reason the chicken tasted off. Me being an idiot thought it was just the spices so I added more hot sauce not realizing it may be undercooked. But even then the chicken still was super juicy albeit on the small side...and potentially undercooked.   Peri peri fries with the garlic sauce...bless up.  I'll probably have to go again...all the other reviews we are good and in inclined to give it another shot"}
{"text":"I've been to several Nandos location and this one remains the best of them all. Great portions, amazing staff, clean environment.  Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Casual setting with great flavours. I do appreciate a place that can cook chicken well, and keep it exciting even though it isn't my meat of choice. I'm not sure that I'm a big fan of the serve yourself atmosphere. One can't dress up the place as it is, and then have food court like service.  Nevertheless I would still keep coming back for the sauces. I highly recommend a sharing platter with chicken skewers, half chicken and wings. Great for two people."}
{"text":"Nando's is a nice option for a sit-down lunch that is more reasonably priced. Here are a few thoughts:  What's not to like:  Upon entering you have to be assigned a table, then place an order at a register. This process can be rather clunky.  Portion sizes tend to be smaller than average.  What's to like:  Their sauces and the chicken are delicious.  The freestyle coke machine.  Prices that are slightly higher than fast food served in a comfortable, nice environment where you could have a legit lunch or dinner meeting.  Plenty of options, though some come with small up charges."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Nando's all my life - growing up in Asia, we've had Nando's since God knows when! When one finally opened up in the downtown area, I was so excited to know that it's so close to where I live! ( see the pattern of why I can never escape food?!)  Anyhow, this is probably the best (almost) fast-food Portuguese roasted chicken in town! The chicken is tender, fresh and flavorful. On top of that, there's so many different sauces you can smother your chicken with. My all-time favorite would be the medium and garlic. They're the perfect match to everything!  Now let's get to the sides. Not the biggest fan of the mashed potato or the coleslaw, but the piri-piri fries are to-die for! I also really like the fountain drinks machine - you don't get to try 100 flavors (the drinks are bottomless!) all the time.   I've yet to try any of their desserts - but certainly would love to at some point. Especially the Portuguese egg tarts that just tempt you at the cashier!"}
{"text":"I think that less the 3 stars is a bit harsh.  Nando's chicken is either good or excellent, depending on your preferences. Some of my friends love it and swear by it. I don't, but I still think it's 1000x better than swiss chalet.  If you are craving chicken, then come here and order chicken. If you order only chicken, you will be satisfied. Don't forget to add sauce. It's an essential part of the experience.  However, there isn't much else to offer. The sides are expensive and underwhelming.  Furthermore, the restaurant is sometimes filled with tables of dirty plates. Plus, you are basically serving yourself.  It can also take longer to get your food than it should.  Stick to the chicken."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken.  Service is a little slow, but the food is nice and fresh. Move expensive than Swiss chalet, but much more tastier."}
{"text":"How can I not like this place .  Reasonable price  Roughly  $15 per person include drink. Unlimited drink and desert  Enough servers and cooks who's friendly.  unique and vintage atmosphere make me feel comfortable .  Their Signature chicken is so tasted and tender. Also I noticed the salad ingredients are all fresh.  Just one thing that it's very busy and crowded . But I still love it :-)"}
{"text":"I went there once because I live on that street. I didn't like it at all. The chicken was so, so dry and the skewers are just too small. I immediately realized it's not worth the money. I did like the garlic mashed potatoes but I figured I can probably find that in a box at the supermarket.   What I like is the place itself. The decoration is fun and colourful, the space is large and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Restaurants' beauty needs to be more than skin deep.  Nando's attractive Bay Street location is part of the sprawling South African multinational chain, with 1,000 locations worldwide and counting. The decor, furnishings and staff all play a part in the eye candy appeal. But the disconnect between the visual presentation and actual food served is akin to a Hollywood set which looks great but lacks substance.  Their split service concept, rather average food and conversation killing loud background music amounts to a frustrating dining experience.   You're shown to your table to decide on your order, get up to go to one of five cashes to order and pay for it, proceed to the service station to fetch your cutlery, sit back down and wait for your meal to arrive. Since the \"server\" didn't actually take your order there is no sense of who ordered what. To add insult to injury, dishes arrive at different times as they are prepared as part of a whole location queue rather than for a group of diners at one table. This process is especially annoying when, as in our case, only two of us were dining.  The food while attractively presented leaves plenty to be desired. Let's start with the signature Peri Peri chicken. The sauce, as promised is quite flavourful. The \"double\" skewers of breast meat, $10, however were miniscule, overcooked and dry. Despite the menu's declaration of \"love at first bite\" it's far more like a first date gone terribly wrong. There is nothing else included with the chicken as sides are extra. I decide on the Peri Peri vegetables, $2.50, as this pepper based sauce is Nando's feature attraction. The vegetables turn out to be a déjà vu experience of the first dish: wonderful sauce but the barely cooked vegetables, primarily made up of humdrum carrots and green peppers, were teeth jarringly raw.   What a disappointment for a global chain that made its name on such a worthy chicken dish, yet displays its inexcusable ineptitude by over cooking it."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled chicken! I love coming here in the winter time, they have that grilled bbq flavour you get from a summer outdoor bbq grill. The sides are also delicious. I love their caesar salad and potato fries. They also have a selection of sauces that are yummy. For such a busy place they have great customer service, we had 4 servers come by to ask us how we're doing and how was the food."}
{"text":"The chicken is so yummy! I took my friend here for a quick lunch. It was her first time, and she enjoyed it. Score!  Every time I come to this location, we are seated quickly and the food comes at a reasonable time.   I always get the lemon and herb because I'm not a fan of spicy foods. Although it's still a little too spicy for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is THE BEST!!! I come here very often with my friend, and the service is always phenomenal. When you come in you are greeted by someone who brings you to your table, and then give your order at the cash and someone always comes and checks on how the meal is going and then cleans up after you are finished. Today I interacted with four different people and they were all so nice...I couldn't get over it. The food was amazing as always (I had the Halloumi chicken salad) and came to our table very fast.  The service is always outstanding every single time I've been in and every person I've ever interacted with is so nice. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"This is the only location I've been to actually. Mainly because of the nice interior decor! The Peri peri chicken is really good with their sauce!! I usually get their corn & rice for the sides. Also, their kisses chocolate dessert is really good too! It was I think around $5? And it's surprisingly not too sweet, good to end the meal! Highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We came here Asa group for quick dinner.  We order family pack chicken with mango flavour and medium spices.  The food came out quickly and it taste better compare to Swiss chalet.  We also ordered some side dish eg. Fries, rice, and vegetable.  The price was very reasonable averaging $15 all in per person.  The only concern I have is the seating arrangement.  Its more like first come first serve seating."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with Nando's. But there's nothing to write home about either. It's better than Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"Unpleasant experience for the past few consecutive times we've been here this year. Corn was not fresh. Chicken wings were dry. Coleslaw had a weird foul taste. The dining area was not clean. Surely, we will not go back. The only good food they had was the garlic bread. If you want to eat at Nando's, go to Downtown instead."}
{"text":"Discovering Nando's more than 10 years ago in Mississauga, it has been a good place to visit if you need a Portugese-ish feel to grilled chicken.  As the years go by, the quality of the food has decreased.  The taste is good and just okay, not stellar as it was in the past.  I don't know if it's because this franchise is mass produced so it's treated like a fast food joint?  I hope not!  I ordered the Double Leg Medium spice with Peri-Peri fries and rice.  It was A-OK.  The chicken tasted fine and everything but it still had a jelly like texture to the meat.  If they left i for a minute or two longer, it would be better as it would be cooked more.  The fries were a bit soggy and the spice was saturated in the middle of the fries and not all around.  Rice was meh.  I hope this place gets better in the future, or else, I may stop going altogether."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and brilliant sitting, perfection when it comes to the flavor and how fresh the chicken is...great value, the best in Canada I think. Great for families, couples and business lunch or dinner. I always been at Mississauga location but I gave it a shot at this amazing Toronto location, great place folks."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by a local who works near by.  It was ok - interesting set up where you wait to get seated, then when ready to order go up to the counter like a fast food restaurant and order.  You then collect your own cutlery and any hot sauces you want.  Ordered the 1/4 lemon and herb chicken with spiced rice and garlic mashed potato's.  Nothing spectacular but was ok.  Like another review stated not far off a Swiss Chalet.  Don't think would return."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before but Nando's was so bad that I had to!! Dry chicken, soggy fries, and the coleslaw tasted like I was eating straight mayo. Oh and the wrap was so bad!!! Ugh. Feeling sick. Don't order."}
{"text":"Amazing food great spicy chicken. Even their plainish chicken is deliciously seasoned. A must try as this location is Halal"}
{"text":"Nando's has been my go to chicken spot for years!! I absolutely love their BBQ style chicken & obviously the famous sauces!! Way better than Swiss Chalet style chicken in my opinion. The ordering style can be a little confusing for first time visitors so don't be shy to ask questions.  Recently this location has been renovated & I enjoy the bright atmosphere it has now. I only wish they didn't change their coleslaw!! It was very heavy with mayo & not crispy like the previous one. I did tell the manager on duty who was more than happy to switch the coleslaw to garlic mashed potatoes. The garlic mashed potatoes have been improved & they are delicious!!  After writing this review I'm craving some Nando's right now!"}
{"text":"I really like the decor and design of Nandos. The restaurant design is very creative and spacious.   I like the concept and the idea of the restaurant. You chose what you want to eat, and then your food is delivered to your table. You also grab what drink you want, and the many sauces they offer. From the menu I ordered the peri peri 1/4 chicken with medium spicy. I got medium because I wasnt sure of how spicy it was. I regret it because it wasn't spicy at all. But next time i will sure to get a higher level of spice. I got the peri peri fries on the side, I really enjoyed the fries, it had a good taste to it, and they give you a generous amount.   Overall I was really impressed by the friendly service, the decor and the food. Nando's is perfect for anyone looking for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"If I'm looking to have chicken (that's not deep fried) for dinner, this is my go-to downtown. Love the atmosphere and their chicken (dark meat only, white meat can still be a tad dry). Accompanied with garlic mash and macho peas makes the perfect dinner. Their grilled halloumi is also very tasty. And we can't forget about their peri peri sauce, it's the star of the show.   One complaint - they accept SPC but only on the cheapest food item that was ordered... I didn't even get a detailed receipt because they had to input it in a weird way. SPC only stipulated that it can't be used on the share platters and I only ordered double leg w/ 2 sides, appeteaser platter, and 2 beverages. Weird."}
{"text":"Having eaten at Nandos in many different countries, including South Africa where it all started, This location is as good as anywhere. I do wish they had the chicken breast option like they have in England, but I will take the half chicken extra hot any day of the week . And the beans....... Also try the red pepper dip with pita.  Looking forward to the location opening in mahogany down south."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Nando's.  Used to be a regular when I lived in Vancouver.  Was happy to see they eventually made their way to Calgary.  We do not eat here as often as hubs would like (he loves it), but when we do we are never disappointed.  Now having said that I will say there is one thing that does disappoint...the fact they do not serve milk!    Moving on we stopped into Nando's last night on our way out for a movie.  Hubs had been wanting to go for awhile.  My daughter and I both ordered chicken pitas, hubs had a half chicken and my boy had the chicken skewer.  Everything was great except my hot peri peri chicken pita was dang hot and the beer / water was not helping to cool down my mouth LOL (milk might have helped!!).  I still proceeded to dip my fries in the hot sauce (call me crazy).  The food was yummy and I love that you are able to buy a bottle of their peri-peri sauce to take home.  They also offer take out which is a great idea for a picnic in the park or an easy meal on a hot summer day.  Service was decent, we were able to order, grab a table...and have our food arrrived shortly after.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The half chicken was really good and the price was not too expensive. The only downside is the wait time. It took about 10-15 minute for the order and the style of the restaurant reminds you of a fast food take out joint. Overall, I would definitely go back and try the wings or the chicken leg again. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here more than a dozen times ever since it opened. The chicken is just filled with flavour. The peri peri fries are the highlight! The price is fair for what you get. The atmosphere is gorgeous, and especially the festive music playing in the washroom! It's a great place to come whether you're with your whole family or just with friends!"}
{"text":"Nando's has to be one of my favourite 'quick' food places when I was living in London, UK.  This is a no-frills kind of place that serves spectacular grilled chicken and family-style sides, all with very unique spices and flavours that come together for an amazing and affordable meal.  Nando's is a Portuguese restaurant with literally hundreds of combinations of ways to eat chicken.    The process to eat is very simple and straightforward.  You are seated as you would expect at a restaurant in Calgary.  This is the end of what you would expect.   At this point you have a table number and that was the end of any opportunity to have a server.  You need to go to the front till and make your order.  Your order starts with how much of a chicken your table wants.  This is served family-style and you can order any parts or entire full chickens.  There are classic sides like Corn on the cob, coleslaw and amazing peri-peri fries.    Once you have ordered, they hand you a cup for your beverage (obviously self-serve) and you choose your owns spices and sauces to add to the mix and you are good to go.  I highly recommend you take the detour and go to Nandos... it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Nando's. Their chicken are flavorful and juicy. So I ordered the Peri Peri 1/4 chicken with coleslaw. Came up as $11. They bring you the chicken. This is like a fast food restaurant with some kind of service. Parking is plentiful. So when you arrive, they ask you how many people and assign a table to you. Then you go order and tell the person taking the order your table number. Once your food is ready, they will bring it over.   Restaurant is clean and has a really nice interesting décor to it.   Love Nando's"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. It is not as greasy as fast food but it is served in about the same time. I visited the establishment on Friday during Easter weekend. It was very busy. I went there with a couple friends and we waited for about ten minutes. We compromised for the common table instead of the booth since we had to rush to movie after. The service is not great. My friend was charged for a drink but never given a glass. Our table was not clean and we asked for it to be cleaned but it never did. We ended up just eating on the dirty table any way."}
{"text":"This is the second evening I have come over for a beer as my kids are at Laserquest (today and Putting Edge yesterday). So I come over to have a beer and it's the first time I have been here. The first impression was the smell...not a pleasant smell but like a greasy kitchen smell. I have heard how their chicken's pretty good and preferred over Swiss Chalet but after the service I had...NO WAY! First let me say, how can I pay tips right in the beginning when I cannot judge the service? A bunch of under aged servers made me wait 20 minutes for a beer (yesterday) and today 10 minutes. Honestly, hire more aged 19 years older servers or let me pour my own beer! Today I sat in a 4 seater and was asked politely to move to a 2 seater as they needed it for 4 people. I moved my own plate and everything off the table to accommodate...them 2 minutes later, 2 people sat down at my old table...wtf?? I then asked the host what happened and he was polite and apologized. They need to have a capable manager make some smart decisions as I will not be coming back to this location due to incompetent service.  I'm not sure if I will EVER go to a Nando's as I'm not impressed. I tried the peri peri sauce and meh...it's all right."}
{"text":"I ate there today with a few friends and the food was amazing. I never ate African or Portuguese before. I was disappointed with the apperance of the seats at the booth. The leather on the seats was peeling off. Otherwise, the customer service was excellent and the supervisor that night was helpful, friendly and fun. I wish they did delivery."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Kitchen Speed: 5/5 Value: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5  Don't think of the place as fast food.  If you do, you'll find the prices unreasonably high.  If you think way back to when Swiss Chalet started, they weren't fast food either.  They were the quintessential go out for chicken place.  I think that's the niche now owned by Nandos.  The food is good and the experience is different from most restaurants.  Worth trying at least once and in our case, worth going back.  Too bad its so far away since we live in the south."}
{"text":"Solid chicken place at a reasonable price. Chicken and hot sauces are the stars, the sides are not.  Went to Nando's and tried a half chicken,and a variety of hot sauces. The chicken skin has a good crispness to it, and the chicken was tasty. The garlic hot sauce was amazing. I was dipping my potato wedges in it too. The sides are less than stellar. The portions for the peas and some of the veggies is pretty small. And the peas didn't have much going on to them. Though I respect that they were firm, so they were probably fresh? Maybe? But they were probably too firm... The potato wedges came in a huge portion. If you are sharing a meal, that is definitely a side worth considering. But they weren't anything special. But they also didn't taste that unhealthy for you and were probably baked. So that is a plus.  If I had kids and a family, I could definitely see taking them here, as it's decent quality food at a reasonable price. But I wasn't blown away to the point where I have to run back. Though if someone gifted me some of their garlic hot sauce I'd be pretty pleased."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the shared variety platter of chicken and 2 sides.  The chicken was saucy and moist, and the sides were relatively small (especially to come with a shared platter) compared to the amount of chicken.  I didn't taste much of a difference between the different sauces I tried in the chicken.  It was decently priced at about $20-23 per person including taxes and tip."}
{"text":"This is a 2.5. Yelp give us more stars or percentages to play with.  After a long time of not going I visited Nando's again. I remember that I stopped going a couple of years ago because the chicken was low in quality and had bone and marrow inside. This time the chicken seemed of higher quality (1 point) and was also flavourful (another point). The bread was a little different and fine. The chain is known for its peri peri sauces of which they offer herb, medium, hot and very spicy. One can also order it as a wrap or sandwich. The 'hot' is just that and not too much.  The portions are the first disappointment. It is a small sandwich with little in the way of sides or fixings. The chicken itself is rather small in size. It is not a good value. Swiss Chalet has better value.  Nando's clientele also loses it a point. You know the type of men who any self respecting or educated woman avoids: males walking around in track pants and the unwashed look or leaning against their car with the running engine in track pants in the parking lot. That is their clientele. Then there are the families with the unruly and noisy children and the father chewing with his mouth open thinking he is special. This forces you to consider take-out as the only option, which is a good thing to save on tipping.  Another star is also lost because they are slow. It took more than 20 minutes to get the take-out.  Finally, they are open a little later which is a bonus in a city where everything shuts down so early."}
{"text":"The decor is so amazing for a chain restaurant. They've been open for 4 months now. We couldn't resist the garlic bread, so we opted in for starters. Their signature peri peri chicken was very tender but I am not sure if the marinade reaches all the way to the bone as they claim. We quite enjoyed the crispy skin but it got boring in subsequent bites. They offer bottomless cups for soft drinks and you can self serve it from the touchpad. The only downside was the peri peri chicken whole wheat wrap with cilantro yogurt and chilli jam. There was no real taste in the wrap, fortunately we ordered the spicy mayo which helped the cause. The portuguese custard tarts were quite rich and a good way to finish the meal. I don't think it has the kind of draw to have me gravitate towards them in the near future."}
{"text":"Nando's, known for its famous Peri-Peri chicken. I usually order takeout, dining in at the Richmond Hill location, is not ideal for me, too busy during peak times, service is not the best. On the plus side they do serve beer, and the chicken is amazing. My takeout order consisted of one whole chicken, Peri-Peri hot, cut into 8, an order of chicken liver (comes with a bun) and an order of regular chips. My order took approximately 20 to 25 minutes, came with cutlery and I requested two little containers of hot sauce on the side. The person who took my order was friendly and attentive. The food; the chicken was awesome, best in the city, the liver was just okay, what I don't like about their chicken liver, it comes in little pieces not the full whole pieces of chicken liver that I prefer, subsequently the small pieces get overcooked and a little bit dry, the chips were good, nice big pieces. Overall, it was a good meal, the chicken gets top marks, the rest of the meal was average. Value for the money, 4/10, the whole chicken, average size, including tax, was over $21.00. I will always recommend Nando's, there's a reason why they're known for their famous Peri-Peri chicken..."}
{"text":"Eaten here multiple times, have to say it's the best flame grilled chicken around. Their side dishes are usually pretty good as well, we usually get a whole chicken, peri peri fries, the garlic bread and a casa salad. Only once in 20 years dining here did I receive a side of cold fries, which they replaced promptly. Usually staff is extremely friendly, on a Monday night on a snowy evening all the staff where in good spirits. Even got a Portuguese tart yum yum!! Best way to finish off your burning mouth from all the delicious peri peri sauce.  Love this place will always keep going back.  The only negative is that sometimes they are so busy you have to wait sooooo long!! But it's always worth it. I recommend eating in rather than taking out. U get all the sauces there to try and your food will be fresh not sitting in a bag on your drive home."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, better then KFC, Swiss Chalet, and Popeyes. I wish the chicken was a little larger but that is my only complaint. Chicken is always juicy and cooked to perfection. It is always spiced perfectly too if you decide to get it a little hotter then plain. The side dishes are also good, especially the garlic bread, and potatoes. Let's not forget to give a shoutout to their amazing nando's sauces for the chicken-my favourite being the garlic sauce. Placing an order for pickup is quick and delicious, and in house dining is also quick with friendly service at the front. I will be back soon, so glad it is down the street from my house :)"}
{"text":"This was pretty tasty. We got take out but wished they gave us more piri piri sauce. The chicken was good but I'm not a fan of the turmeric  rice"}
{"text":"decor & atmosphere are creative, i like the Nando's hot sauce, grilled pineapple is recommended, as well as the share plate. My boyfriend and i tried the share plate for 2-3, and it's enough for us.it's quite delicious, 1/2 chicken, 5 chicken wings, 2 chicken skewers, and side dishes are grilled corn & peri peri fries, nice deal !"}
{"text":"I started going to Nando's way before I joined Yelp so this review slipped my mind until my most recent visit. Then I remembered that I have to give (one of) my favourite restaurant(s) a 5 star rating so everyone can enjoy it!  Where do I begin...I've lived next to Nando's for about 4 years now, and every time I go back I'm blown away by how flavourful and tasty their food is. I've tried just about every item on their menu, but my ABSOLUTE favourites are:  1) chicken (duh) - get the half or quarter if you're feeling like chicken, the double skewers may be tantalizing but it's really not worth your money. 2) chicken sandwich - for only $8.55 by itself or $13.05 with TWO sides, you can't beat the price on this sandwich. The roll is one of the best breads I've ever had on a sandwich, and it really fills you up for cheap. 3) whole wheat chicken wrap - I think I love this for the sweet chilli jam and cilantro yogurt, but whatever they're putting in there it's working for me. Same price as the chicken sandwich, but I find it to be a lot more flavourful.  4) peri-peri fries - get this with the perinaise (it'll cost you an extra $1, but trust me, it's worth it).  The thing about Nando's is that you order and pay up at the front counter, then they bring the food to you. You're responsible for getting your own cutlery, sauces, and drinks. This causes me some turmoil when it comes to tipping (which you are expected to do at the time of ordering), because I am a firm believer that tips are earned, not expected. If you do a good job of taking my order, bringing me my food, refilling my water and whatnot, you deserve the 15% tip. But if all you're doing is walking my plate from the kitchen to my table, then I'm not sure if they should be demanding a 15% tip up front (their tip options on their card machines are 15%, 18%, and 20%). Not the biggest deal because I really do love their food, but it bothers me a little every time I'm there.  TL;DR Go to Nando's and get some chicken. You won't be disappointed. The wait times may be deterring sometimes, but just wait it out - the line moves fast and you'll soon be enjoying some juicy, mouthwatering chicken."}
{"text":"Beautiful location in downtown Toronto. I've had nandos in zim, SA and Maryland. Maryland location wasn't any good. This locations food is comparable to SA and zim. Nice succulent chicken and seasoned well. I love nandos hot sauce. I am glad we decided to give this location a try. I recommend the spicy rice and veggies as well."}
{"text":"The chicken was quite dry even after waiting 30 minutes for takeout as they were extremely busy and said they made it fresh. Please. We had to dip it in something just to make it edible. The fries came out of the kitchen lukewarm as well. They had obviously been under the heatlamp for quite some time.  The only saving grace is the price but I would rather just make it myself without the old dry texture and day old fries."}
{"text":"A reasonably useful lunch place. Drive in, get some chicken with salad, pour some sauce over the remnants of that nonflying bird, eat the result, go back to work.  Food quality is decent, though variety is not there - at all. You can choose from basically the same plate, with different levels of \"spicy\", defined by the sauce.  Service is nice, ambient is far from cozy (them hard-surfaced benches), but overall the place is clean and quite visitable."}
{"text":"Service is good, taste is impeccable! We love Nando's and come to this SAME location everytime we're in town...   We even get the large sauce to take back home ($50) but its sooo tasty!  The people that work there are sweet, helpful and reallllly accomodating. It's fast food but with a great sit-down dining experience. Ambiance is nice and although I'm not familiar with Portuguese culture, I am assuming their cuisine is awesome because of my experience here....  It's not too salty, but with a kick of garlic and spice on their chicken. The prices are cheap consider 5 people were ABSOLUTELY full from a $50-60 pricetag (and this included three hungry males).   We ordered whole chicken (medium spice) and half chicken (extra spicy) it was a family pack and came with three sides which were good. Their slaw is nice, corn on the cob was a nice touch as well, and baked potato which is a baked potato.   Will continue to come back here and hope others enjoy it!   If you're in the mood to just \"try it out\" they have a $6 chicken sandwich in a pita that was VERY tasty."}
{"text":"I told two of my co-workers that I go on Yelp! to review places so they checked out my reviews.   Jonathan asked if I ever tried Nandos, and I told him I haven't.  \"WHAT??\" as his mouth drops and eyeballs pop out of the sockets, he was shocked.  He raved and raved about Nandos so we chose a day to go out so I can give this Nandos a try.    Nandos is located on 32nd avenue in the NE, not too far away from work.  We decided to go on a Wednesday right at noon.  Thankfully, it wasn't overly busy as expected!  I asked for suggestions and Jonathan suggested the whole chicken with a hot peri peri heat because I can pack up the leftovers so that's what I went with along with the peri peri fries which totaled to about ~$23.  How it works is you pretty much, walk up to the counter, pick your chicken, pay, and then take a seat...they'll bring your order right to your table!!  The nice thing is you pay before you eat so you don't have to wait around for a bill when you're done.  The table has some sauces on the table for the chicken (hot, extra hot or garlic) as well as peri peri spices.  When our orders came, I was pretty excited!  Whole chicken cut up on one plate, a separate side plate for peri peri fries and an empty plate to fill your plate with the chicken and fries!!  My first bite was great!! They marinate all their chicken for 24 hours in their secret sauce until the flavor goes right through to the bone so it's really tender and juicy.  I like crisp so it was nice that the skin had a slight crisp to it!  I thought the chicken was so tasty it didn't need any sauces!  I'm usually not a big fan of hot & spicy foods but for picking hot, it was good! Nothing that burnt my tougue off but enough for me to handle!  As for the fries...they were regular fries with a little bit of spices on top...nothing as special as the chicken!  All in all, my meal was expensive but I have dinner for later on or lunch for the next day!  It all evens out!  I'm happy I gave Nandos a try because it's definitely another option for lunches and its some seriously healthy chicken!! ;)  Ps. Only location in Calgary!!!"}
{"text":"A very small restaurant but tasty food. The sauces and marinades are delicious! The chicken is a little dry. The Peri peri fries are so good! A little bit on the expensive side but you're getting fresh, hearty food."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group and wasn't sure what to expect for a chicken wings place. I was pleasantly surprised. There was plenty of seating, great environment and layout. The staff were also very friendly and professional. Despite having a large group we got our orders reasonably quickly. I ordered the double leg combo with veggies and Garlic smashed potatoes as sides. It was much better than I expected. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was not too dry or greasy.  The place also has unlimited fountain drinks which you can grab from one of those multiflavour machines (like the ones in cineplex). I would also recommend the tart as a desert. It was really good. Overall I would most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just had Reno looks great inside  Best nandos in gta in terms of food and service  We usually get the chicken w fries garlic bread and chilli  Great spot for kids w multiple high chairs  Chicken is always juicy and remember to grab your own sauce."}
{"text":"I make it a point to try to come here at least once every few weeks. I'm a huge fried chicken but Nando's has made me fall equally in love with grilled chicken because it tastes so great here. The chicken sandwich is highly underrated, I don't see many people get the sandwich but it tastes great (especially with their sauces) and the chicken is juicy and tender. My other favourites are the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 chicken (extra hot) and I can always count on those to hit the spot. They also have a great variety of sides, my favourites being the corn and peri-peri fries.  Can never go wrong with a cheeky Nando's."}
{"text":"Wow!! This is some of the best takeout I've had in a lonnnnnnnnnnnmg time...sorry just trying to get my point across. Seriously though I walked in here and made a takeout order and it was amazing. I never grabbed the name of the fellow who took my order but he was super nice and informative with the menu as I have never ordered from here. All the other staff I can across was also very friendly and I wasn't even there for 10 minutes! I ordered some hot chicken sliders, a portobello and  halloumi cheese slider and a Nando's sized Cesar with the extra hot chicken. Let's start with the sliders. The chicken was most and had the right amount of spice. The buns were tasty.. mmmm buns .. but the chicken really stole the show here. It was moist and sooo full of flavor. If you like hot stuff I would definitely bump it up to extra sauce. The portobello and halloumi cheese slider was different but also very good. It would be an excellent vegetarian option but also good for anyone. Now the Cesar salad was good. The sauce was creamy but average overall. The croutons were crisp and tasted good also. I was so impressed with the quality of the lettuce though. So many times I order a salad from OTHER resteraunts and get browned pieces of lettuce or pieces with spoilage. Not this salad!! Every piece of lettuce was crisp and green! The Parmesan cheese was big and flakey that comes in the salad. I ordered the extra hot chicken with my Cesar salad and was truly delicious. The peri-peri chicken is deliciously flame broiled on the grill. I got take out but there is a nice dining room. They have small tables for 2-4 people all the way up to large tables and booths for big groups of people. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll be returning here again this week! So good!!"}
{"text":"I never realized that chicken served as a main dish on an empty big plate, with either a spit of  salad or fries, can be so small for $12.99.   This place is a joke, and even stylized pseudo-Portuguese style won't help it: the portions are tiny and highly overpriced, the ridiculous serve-yourself process is disruptive and the hunger after \"eating\" here speaks for itself.      Avoid"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the chicken here. It's moist, tasty and perfectly seasoned! I don't know what the secret is, but the chicken is consistently juicy and perfectly cooked! My only quarrel is the quality to price factor. Don't get me wrong, the chicken is phenomenal but it might be the most expensive grilled chicken that I've ever eaten. Beggars can't be choosers, and their peri-peri sauce is out of this world."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night around 7.  This is a place where you order at the front counter take a seat and you get served your meal. It's a bit more pricy but seemed like a good alternative to other \"fast food\" options.  It became very busy after we ordered but it wasn't too bad when we first arrived however we waited 40 minutes for our meal! There seemed to be very little method to the madness. People who came in after us but ordered their food to go received their food first. There was very few staff that would acknowledge your inquires I assume because everyone was asking where their food was.   The food was ok, small portion sizes.  The chicken was flavourful but definitely not worth the price or the  wait!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Nando's yet? Ever since we discovered the location on Bay St last year, we've almost always had it for Sunday dinner. Best tasting chicken (and garlic bread... and pasteis de nata) in the city. Literally finger lickin good. 5/5 no question."}
{"text":"Ordered the platter for two and grilled liver. Lots of food. Really, really dry chicken.  Blah wings. Meh liver. Limp fries. Unremarkable veggies. Decent hot sauce.Nice Decor. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I was here recently with a co-worker. I have to admit that I came with high expectations as I had very good Nandos chicken when I used to live in the UK.  However, the chicken here was quite dry and quite flavourless. The chicken piece was not tender at all. The rice was good but quite spicy so I suppose for those who like it spicy this is a good choice.  The potato salad was good but not so good that it left an impression.  Overall, service was quite fast but you order at the cash and they bring it to you so it's more of a fast food style than a restaurant style kind of service.   Would I go back? Probably not..."}
{"text":"The fact that this place lacks sides like mac n cheese, corn bread, sweet potato fries, it's peri peri garlic sauce and hot sauces makes up grandly for it..So where do I start, I love chicken, I love spice, and this place offers both of these items. I came here with friends ordered 1/4 chicken with peri peri fries for $13.99 it was a steal! A great alternative to Swiss Chalet and the Chalet sauce...although I bet salt count is exactly the same in both places..."}
{"text":"I'd say I expected more chicken when I order a whole chicken but it's good for the price.   They have a range of condiments at the back and I really like the taste of their hot sauce!! definitely would go again its my go-to place for fast protein fix   The side is pretty small tbh and its already the \"large\" size. but do go if you like tasty spicy tender chicken"}
{"text":"I've had nandos in brampton n the downtown place is the same food wise: delicious! Its big but gets full fast (not surprising coz the food is tasty). We were a big group, we sat in a round table, ate yummy food, and played cards against humanity haha. You cant go wrong if you're looking for a chicken place downtown.  I gave only 4 stars because they need to be better organized when they are full. We waited for 15 mins before someone actually finding out our party size n giving us a waiting cue."}
{"text":"I have since been back and tried their Quinoa with Roasted Sweet Potato and Avocado salad for $8.99 (add $4.50 for chicken) and really enjoyed it. The portion was great, and the ingredients were fresh. I would not bother adding the chicken though because the amount of chicken they give you is not worth the $4.50 (tiny portion). I don't like dining in during the rush hours (noon and 6pm) because it gets very loud and it is difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it here. It's a sociable atmosphere and you're encouraged to get up and move around a bit. We had the piri piri full chicken which was cooked perfectly, some mashed potatoes which were tasty and some peas which were just okay. You've got to go in knowing it's a different kind of restaurant experience. If you just go with it, you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Ive only came to Nando's a handful of times, but i would always choose it over swiss chalet. I love the peri peri flavour that comes out the chicken. Also, don't forget to try the peri-peri fries! At the side they have mild, medium, hot, and garlic peri-peri sauce to add one. Must try! If you like spicy food go right for the hot. PRICE: $$ The price is about what you would pay at swiss chalet, but i feel like the chicken is a bit smaller. Ive attached a photo of the menu for you to look at. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Its not like your traditional restaurant where they take your order at your seat. If you'd like take out, you order at the front, and if you want to dine-in the server will seat you and give you a table number. You then can look at the menu at your table and go up to the front to place your order and pay.  *Don't forget your table number*.  The servers are hard to get sometimes and i had to go up to the front to ask for a few things.  I give the customer service a 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Nando's just showed up on Doordash, so naturally being the quizzical person I am, we just had to order! It's been years since I've had it, but I definitely remember the delicious sauce on the table, and the familiar taste of home-grilled wings.   We grabbed up a couple double leg dinners with peri peri fries, spiced rice, and a side of grilled wings (Don't judge me ok), and it was bommmb! I cheated and reheated the fries in the toaster oven, and doctored up the chicken with a slathering of peri peri sauce - but still, it was really good! The meat was super tender, and not over cooked.   That peri peri sauce though, damn! I could bathe in it....  The price is average, but for the impact value this place has, it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"As you enter, you see a really nice decor. You sit in to just look at the menu and have to order upfront. The service is really nice and quick. The chicken was really juicy and the mild/hot chicken had the best taste and we used the garlic peri peri sauce which was amazIng with fries. The peri peri rice had a really nice taste aswell and if chicken is too spicy for you the rice was amazing to dull it down. That was a big plus for my gf since she doesn't like spicy food but I love it. Overall the half which was very juicy, not greasy and tasted even better with peri peri garlic flavor which gave it a perfect kick."}
{"text":"When I was studying abroad as a poor exchange student in the UK, Nando's was the go-to place for post-drinking chicken and chips. When Nando's opened at its Bay location, I was ecstatic to relive the taste of drunken shame and peri-peri sauce.   We arrived on a rainy Friday evening and had no issues being seated. The menu is a little different at this location, but the Variety Share Platter we ordered was everything I love at Nando's: wings, skewers, and a half chicken. I usually am a huge fan of the wings, but out of the 5 we received, 3 were a tad undercooked. Other than the disappointment of the undercooked wings, the chicken was juicy and the sauces were just as tangy and delicious as I remembered.  The drink dispenser is one of the really elaborate fun ones that has over half a million flavours or something. I always mistrusted these dispensers, because I felt like the unpopular flavours are never changed and just sit there in their artificial disgustingness. My mistrust still did not discourage me from trying the gross lime and raspberry flavours, which tasted just as I expected - a mix between burnt plastic and cough syrup.  For dessert we ordered the carrot cake because I am a huge suck for it. My ideal carrot cake is plump with raisins and oh so moist. This one was a little crumbly and covered in too much icing, but it was still enjoyable.  Overall, it was a reasonably pleasant dinner with too-dim lighting, and I will have absolutely no qualms about coming back for a budget-friendly meal. However, it definitely did taste better when I was young and naive eating Nando's out of a take-away container after five pints too many."}
{"text":"Their chicken tastes good but the portions are small. I mean, that \"half a chicken\" is really half of a very small chicken. I've had a quarter chicken at home that filled me more than their half a chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Nando's and was pretty disappointed.   First off, the potato wedges were mixed with fries and some weird chips. It seemed as though they were just closing up shop and wanted to get rid of scraps.   Second, the mashed potatoes were raw.  Third, rice was rock hard.   Fourth, chicken was bland.   Fifth, the portions were trash, overpriced garbage.   Paid $28, for 2 chicken meals and it was a big disappointment.   My experience in store was definitely different from delivery."}
{"text":"Their chicken is really juicy, and the place is cute and colorful. Remember add some sauce to ur meal. Nice try if u curious about Portuguese + South African food :)"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ordering online from this location. We ordered two foods to be delivered to us through the Nando's official website. The person who delivered the food walked for 15 minutes in -15'C to deliver the food in a paper bag. We received the food cold and uneatable. We ended up going to some other restaurant to eat. I cannot believe I spend to much money and time on this. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about Nando's.  The service staff were great and I didn't mind ordering at the counter.  The decor was cool.  But it was a little to \"shopping mall\" busy for me and the chicken was definitely a bit too salty.  I'll probably give it another shot but I am not sure the Chipotle of Peri Peri chicken will do it for me."}
{"text":"If the window's any indication, Nando's is the place to be among the younger civil servant set.   Every day around lunchtime, this place is packed with sharp-dressed 20-30 year olds, looking for different poultry than their Chalet-loving parents. Quarter chicken with dries and sauce? That's as old school as the finger-bowls they used to offer.   Nando's is hip. It's now. it's confusing.   We wait in line to be seated among the pretty young things of Bay Street, only to jump up in order to place our order at the cash.   We choose from a dizzying array of chicken and sides, and customize our birds with a choice of peri-peri sauce.   My colleague opts for grilled chicken breast with salad. I choose a chicken sandwich, extra-hot, with a ice of allegedly special potato wedges.   Food arrives within a few minutes (a good thing, since we're on the clock to get back to our respective offices).   The chicken is...well, chicken. Cooked just a bit past juicy, it's nonetheless livened by the Peri-Peri sauce (which itself registers as more sweet than heat).   My sandwich arrives on hefty Portuguese bread, which may actually be the best thing about it (although fresh lettuce and ripe tomato are welcome surprises for late Fall).   The aforementioned wedges are the usual spice-dredged deep-fried slabs 'o' spud. My colleague salutes my willpower, but frankly I'd rather save room for the bread.   Nando's may be the new school in Toronto's chicken scene, but for fries and sauce that's truly boss, I'd rather kick it old school at the Chalet Swiss."}
{"text":"They practically asked for my first-born in exchange for wifi.  Made me wait 10 minutes to order despite a full staff and only two customers.  Then the pop machine wouldn't work.  Then the other pop machine malfunctioned, spraying me with fanta syrup that stuck to my arms and cheeks like a drunken henna tattoo.  Then I received dirty cutlery.  Then the food took 25 minutes.  Then, while bringing my order, the server dropped about a third of my fries on the floor but decided not to replace them.  Then the chicken arrived cold with spongy, gelatinous skin, obviously not cooked despite me asking for it to be well done.  With tax and a tip, 27 dollars.  Ouch."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the chicken and hot sauce are perfect. There's a drinks machine with more than enough variety. Anyhow chicken and hot sauce is probably what I'll be heading back for. Also hot mayo."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I really was looking for better.   Maybe my mistake was going here on the coldest night of the year.  The doors really aren't well insulated, as gusts of -20 winds easily got into the building freezing any poor customer seated nearby.  Imagine how much worse that is when the doors are open as people go in and out.  I was seriously unimpressed with the chicken.  It wasn't really all that flavorful, so I might have gotten them on a bad day?  I read some of the other reviews, but what I experienced was just not even ok.  The only standout really was the chicken livers appy, which we ended up ordering a 2nd order.  But as for the rest, it just wasn't a particularly good portuguese style chicken.    To the owners of Nando's in Calgary, I would honestly go to Montreal and try out how it's really done at Coco Rico on St-Laurent St (and while you're at it, get a smoked meat at Schwartz's which is just next door).  I know you're hamstrung by corporate recipes, but honestly, I think you'll be way seriously more impressed by Coco Rico and tweak what you can to match the raw flavour, taste and simple joy that they bring to their customers."}
{"text":"3.5 I came here because British youtubers rave about Nando's all the time. I was disappointed to find the chicken and peri peri wedges just okay. The portions are not big so definitely would recommend getting the 1/4 chicken with TWO sides or just get the 1/2 chicken. The decor was nice though and the bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"If you don't know what to eat today, eat at Nando's!!!  Every Friday night my friends and I get together after work for a few drinks, and we ALWAYS end up at this Nando's. It's become a tradition. It's actually so weird how excited we get for Nando's on a Friday night.  I have been to Nando's a few times before at other locations and it's not as fancy as this one! This place is huge with high ceilings and communal tables perfect for large groups, or booths to get comfy and to induce your food coma even faster.  I have no complaints on their food. Their chicken is perfect every time, and their sides are whatever but their sauces make everything taste 10x better."}
{"text":"First and last visit.   Scrawny stringy chicken served at room temperature with a casa salad that was so old it couldn't even remember it's youth.  Partner had a chicken pita. Let's just say that when it comes with a Kraft single boldly overflowing from the pita you just know it's not going to be good.  I was confused by their demand to pay before being served but it became clear during dinner. Also, why am I tipping? We even had to set our own table!  On the plus side the decor is lively and colourful."}
{"text":"Nando's is a Portuguese style flame-grilled chicken place.  The chicken is quite good and flavorful.  Expect a long line if you aren't there right at noon (for lunch).  We waited a good 20 minutes before we ordered (they don't take orders over the phone).  Another 10minutes later we were eating around 12:40pm.  I'd try to go back here again at dinner if I go back at all.  The hostess could not be found and when she did appear she was clueless.  We asked for a table and she said there were no tables available but she took our name down... After a few minutes we found a few empty tables and just sat down ourselves.  She never did look for us.  Food is OK, service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I am still confused how this place is a mix of South African and Portuguese food. But after reading that Toronto has a big Portuguese community we decided to try this place out. I thought the decor inside was really cool and unique, but I wasn't as excited by the limited wait service they offer. How am I supposed to pay and tip before I had any service? Not a smart idea. As for the food, we did the family special. The chicken was pretty good, and I liked the sauces that they used, but you can't amaze me too much with chicken. The garlic bread was also very good, I should've gotten more! We got the sangria jug too, but it didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Dat chicken!!! Moist, juicy and flamed-grilled with just the right amount of heat and flavour. The peri peri rub is smokey, sweet, zesty and possesses the perfect kick.   I usually order my food to go and have never bothered sitting down to eat here. However this particular location looks very chic with its cool modern decor. It is also very family-friendly.  You can order the chicken as whole (cut up), skewers, wings etc. in various degrees of spiciness. The sides include peri peri fries, which I find a tad too salty. Macho peas, peri peri veggies, corn, coleslaw and spiced rice are also on the menu.  The peri peri sauces, which are also sold at the counter, come in extra-hot, hot, or garlic."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I buy into the hype that is Nandos - both the chicken and the sauce. For the amount you pay, you don't get a lot of chicken. The leg and thigh is tiny and you always end up craving more. The taste of the chicken is alright, I feel like you can get a better tasting rotisserie chicken from Costco at the same price. If the price INCLUDED a side, I think it would be more worth it. But as it currently stands, I won't be returning to Nando's unless I absolutely have no other food options.  Everyone raves about the sauce but I didn't find it to be particularly amazing. It definitely had a kick, but there was nothing special and I haven't craved it since."}
{"text":"3.5 star  I am not really sure.... that Classic Shared Platter ($25) is for 2-3 people??   I know it is a WHOLE flame-grilled chicken... maybe it is a baby chicken.. I don't think it is ready to be eaten yet..  The chicken though is good... We even able to get half of it in mild and half in extra spicy... At least no one would able to eat my XX spicy half.  The peri vegetable is grilled then tossed in olive oil ... almost the highlight of the meal.  Family owned with the wife at the cash and the daughter delivering the meals... nice enough people... homey feel...  I love Peri Peri Sauce...and it is great that extra of those are on the table for me to drown my chicken in the wholesome spiciness!!"}
{"text":"Like, this place was fine.  I was initially intrigued when I read that this chain is found in a lot of different countries.  However....it's really nothing earth shattering.  After debating between just pieces of chicken or the chicken pita, the cashier basically told me to get the pita.  So I did.  One of the cool things is that you can pick the type of sauce you want on the chicken and I picked the hot sauce.    Again, it was fine.  The fries weren't that amazingly seasoned as the other reviews suggest.  The sauces that they give you weren't anything to rave about.  Perhaps ordering just chicken would have been a better idea.  Or, maybe eating AT the restaurant would have enhanced my experience.  Whatever the case, I don't need to come back here if I ever find one again."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious chicken. I cant get enough of their piri piri sauce. Although pretty expensive as compared to the grocery store rotisserie chicken that you can buy for half the price it is a nice treat every now and then if you are getting tired of the same old chicken. The sides are meh. The chicken is the ckear star. I wouldn't go too often but on days I am too tired to cook we will be walking over to Nando's."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when Nando's first opened thinking there'd be a great new place near Queen's Park to eat lunch at.   Unfortunately the order at the cashier and the line-ups make this place a terrible choice for lunch. And in terms of a business lunch, forget about it.   Food is decent, but the entire setup keeps me away from this place. Too bad."}
{"text":"My favorite Nando's in all of Toronto! Great location, a lot of seating area, definitely can accommodate a huge group of friends. I always getting the 1/2 chicken (hot) with spicy rice and a drink. The chicken is amazing and the rice is just as great! A variety of sauces are always at your disposal. Huge selection of drinks as well, I love Coca Cola Vanilla, definitely try Peach Sprite! Everytime I go and I plan my next trip to Nando's. Make sure to log into the free WIFI, you'll get BOGO deals texted to you time to time."}
{"text":"If you're going to choose a Nandos in Toronto this should be your pick. The decor is top notch as they renovated a few years ago. There's beaded curtains around some of their schmoozy tables which you may need to call ahead for and reserve. They also have long tables for more people. Something special is their drink station. It's unlimited refills and definitely worth it because you can make a zillion combinations of the pop.  I like the concept of ordering food and having it brought to you. It's faster and it saves time especially if you want a decent meal but don't want to deal with the whole shebang. Personally I prefer the chicken to their wraps. I find the wraps too dry and bland. The chicken can be toned down if you get mild and you can build up flavours with their lemon and herb sauce or other sauces. Be aware of their spice levels as their spicey is quite hot. My favorite sides are the peri peri fries which are seasoned to perfection. Their mashed potatoes are also a winner."}
{"text":"This Nando's has a beautiful decor. The beaded chandeliers added a creative ambience to the space.  Unfortunately, the Churrasqueiras was not up to par with the locations in Vancouver. The chicken was not as succulent nor was it as flavorful as I previously remembered. Fortunately, the sauce complimented the dish and escalated the overall flavors.  Tip: Pitas are 1/3 smaller than typical pitas. The prices between the wraps, sandwiches and the pitas are at par ($6.50 - 6.99), however, it seems the wraps are a better choice for value.   P.S. Bottomless frozen yogurt for $3.95 :)"}
{"text":"Loved chicken a lot, fried rice is not so much, lived garlic bread, found service a little confusing, if you have never been there might not know what to do, since servers kind of disregard."}
{"text":"Got takeout, food portions leave slot to be desired at $10 for an entree with one small side. I would recommend increasing the side size then making you pay $2 more for more potatoes. Nice looking location but if your looking for value, I think it's better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been frequent visitors to this location and I'm sad to say that the quality dropped dramatically with the new crew. They got half of our order wrong and made us wait over half an hour for some of the dishes. The quality of the chicken was significantly worse than before, it didn't even look the same! The fries were already semicold when brought out. Don't think we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Catering menu for office function review:  I've eaten at this location a few times and every time I've been there, both the service and food were good.  Where they really wowed me, however, was the level of service and professionalism they provided me with when I ordered from their catering menu and had food delivered to my office for 40 staff members.   I ordered the large peri platter with salad, potato wedges and veggie sandwiches on the side.  Placing the order was super simple. The two managers I spoke to were very helpful. There was a discrepancy in the pricing of two menus which they accommodated me for due to the confusion.  The food arrived on time and tasted great. They don't actually have a delivery service - they put the food in a cab and you pay for the cab upon arrival but that was fine by me - it worked fine.  Where they went above and beyond was that I was tied up on a phone call and didn't notice the time, they had actually called me to tell me that my order had arrived.  If I missed that call the cab would have left.  Koodos to Nando's! I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Nice airy space got takeout Better than Swiss chalet Expensive but well worth it Had lemon chicken breast with wedges and coleslaw Love the paper bag and cardboard containers  Unlike the ugly plastic at Swiss chalet"}
{"text":"My first experience in a Nando's! I've heard plenty of things about this chain, but never got a chance to try the food yet. I was walking by today, and thought, why not! Going to live in this area, might as well enjoy the food!   I gotta say, I really enjoy the atmosphere here. It's just the right amount of professional and cooky put together. Kind of reminds me of my grandma's house back in Europe.  I got a Peri Peri chicken sandwich, which comes served on a ciabatta bun. By the end of my meal, I looked like a crackhead, because of all the flour being left on my chin.  Having taken a lemon & herb spice level, I was surprised to find the sandwich medium spicy. I really like spicy food, I just feel like they should warn people who can't handle too much spice.  All in all, an hour later, I have already forgotten the meal..the food was definitely just A-OK, which is a testament to their current very much 3-star rating on Yelp.  Will come back again if I don't have other options."}
{"text":"A step up from Swiss Chalet for sure. However I wasn't impressed with the portions.   4 of us ordered the whole chicken meal (thinking it was going to be an actual whole chicken) only to find out that it's pre-cut and cooked separately. The flavour was delicious, but even the sides were kinda wimpy. Pricey as well. Overall it was just ok. Will have to go back and get my own personal meal."}
{"text":"Quarter chicken dinner with medium heat, mashed potatoes, coleslaw.for him and side caesar for me. Tip in, it's $55. You pay first, which is weird but one person knew my bf and treated us with utmost respect! Since it was our first time, he delighted us with quips and recommendations. The chicken is OMG; juicy, tender and full of delicious flavour, especially lovely on a cold day. Only reason why it's not five stars is the portion size; on the small size but decadent. However, that was a clean and tasty dinner I'd definetely have again! Also, we were given Nando's Kisses on the house and it was so nice and sweet like the person who served us. Verg cobtent and.highly suvvest coming.here before a night of action plus debauchery."}
{"text":"When I originally reviewed this place, I gave it 3 stars. It was an average of 4 stars for the lemon and herb flavoured chicken and 2 stars for the nonsense of having to get my own utensils.  I stand by that initial rating but now they've added a new flavour option for the chicken - mango and lime - and it's really good so I'm tempted to increase my rating...  ...but no, I get annoyed having to go up and get my own utensils and napkins and sauce. Like seriously??"}
{"text":"Interior decoration is on point, food is not so much.  Once you order at the front, you pick up your own utensils and sauces, and the servers will bring your food to your table once it's ready.  Peri-peri Chicken Thigh (lime seasoning) with 1 side (3/5)- It tasted good, but their chicken size was small. I especially liked the garlic hot sauce Bottomless frozen yogurt (3.5/5)- It was pretty cool that they had a froyo machine that you can get however much plain vanilla froyo you wanted. It was pretty standard and wasn't too friendly for my lactose-sensitive stomach though.  I had a few friends who ordered their Chicken Skewers...you'll be disappointed at how little meat you get for almost $20."}
{"text":"The chicken is definitely juicy and flavourful. It's definitely a step up from your typical Swiss Chalet rotisserie chicken. There were a variety of sides to choose from, but the rice dish had a kind of weird taste to it. Definitely wouldn't recommend the rice for a side."}
{"text":"Eat Nando at London servers years before. The taste does not change too much, but the size became smaller here."}
{"text":"Well all I gotta say about Nando's is Nan-dont!  Take my word on this one folks.  I don't understand what the fuss is all about!  Its no better than Christy's Chicken just up the street, I actually prefer Christy's.  At least its not a fucking gong show there like it is here!  We went in on a Saturday with 2 other couples and 4 kids and were told  that a.) they don't take reservations so its first come, first served and b.) there is only 1 family table (there was another long one in the middle of the restaurant but it was bar height seating.   We head out anyway only to find that the wait is about 30-45min, fine, I drove out from the NW, I had no problem waiting. We put our name down and headed out to our cars because there is no bloody waiting area.  Its sheer chaos!  There were about 20 people in the doorway, people coming to take pick up orders, people lined up into the dining area placing orders, 3-4 \"waitresses\" delivering food to people and people everywhere! By the time we sat down it was well over an hour.  We had one family make a comment about how we got in before they did and gave us nasty looks all night.  The assholes they are, didn't notice that we all were waiting in our cars so our kids wouldn't be a bother to other patrons!!  You would think a place this busy would have those stupid flashing coasters and be delicious...nope and nope!  I agree completely with James B on this one, have a bloody sit down service with waitresses instead of this cafeteria get up.  We had other families walking in complaining about the wait, practically sitting down as people were putting their jackets on, there was one family that had their spawn running amuck in the restaurant filling up frozen yogurt  and pop the entire time we were there and one of the kids got up on the table to dance while the parents were busy molesting each other.  Classy.    And the piece de resistance was these imbeciles brought in McDonalds meals for their kids!  WHO THE FUCK DOES THAT?!  AND WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT ALLOWS THIS?! What irked me more than the table dancing kids and busy-hands parents was there was no one there telling them that this was unacceptable behaviour!!!  There was not authoritative figure in the entire place.   The food was below average in my opinion; the Spicy or Hot chicken tasted like Sriracha chicken and the garlic herb tasted like that powder mix you could buy anywhere, it was mainstream grilled chicken with some mediocre sauces that you pick up yourself from a back bar. (note: the bottles are constantly man-handled by other patrons and not wiped down, simply moved from the dining tables back to the community table.)  The \"family\" sized sides are barely enough for two people, the rice was old and dry.  The wedges were basically thick cut fries, and the coleslaw and garlic bread were the only redeeming sides.    Kids portions were comical, my 8 year old was still hungry after the tiny drum and thigh meal was served to him with about 12 fries.  They don't even get a beverage with the meal, you have to buy it separately ($8.50meal plus $2.50drink is a buck cheaper than an adult meal!!)  and they give them an \"all you can eat\" frozen yogurt cup...btw all the yogurt was done by 7:30 and most of the pop was flat or out of syrup.    No apologies for anything, what a waste of time and money.  I would have rather gone to Chianti's or Christies just up the street for a fraction of the price and wait time.    My gut didn't feel right all night afterwards and the next morning I still didn't feel better, total and utter FAIL!  How one can mess up grilled chicken is beyond me...if you wanna see this debacle for yourself, then come here on a Saturday for dinner, seeing is believing.  Unacceptable, will never, ever come back. Ever.  What a joke."}
{"text":"Their pita tastes pretty good. But the price is a bit high for a small pita (around $8)"}
{"text":"A solid 2!!!  Yes a 2!!!  Why all the excitement for a 2?  After trying to go here a few times and failing to get a seat, we finally made it!  Yay!  Tick this off the must eat bucket list!!!  Meh-maybe... Wow.  One side of the restaurant looks like a kiddie playroom.  Limited seating on both sides of the place - now I see why they have such long line ups sometimes.  Also, the washroom doors were wide open and people were dining next to them - Yuck!  We sat on the other side...of course. First time being there, had the familia dinner.  Basically a whole chicken with two skewers of more chicken, two sides, two breads.  The bread is OK.  Garlic bread is the same bread with some garlic butter on it.  We had the corn - tasty but burnt, and the peri-peri fries.  The fries were hard and tasteless. The chicken was good but one of portions was raw!  We got another piece and this time it was burnt!  OMG-QQF! Oh well, suffice it to say.  Been there, done that.  Don't think it will be on my list of \"Gotta Go Again!!!!\" Cheers!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Nando's and I enjoyed my meal. The grilled chicken was flavorful and I love the different sauces they had. Garlic Al'ail and Medium sauces ftw. Garlic mash potatoes were also great. Servings are huge. Servers were quick and friendly. Wish they'd franchise in the US."}
{"text":"My BF love's this place (I think it's a nostalgia thing), but I think it's meh. There are definitely better, locally-owned, churrascarias in the area!"}
{"text":"Location:  Located in a plaza off of Yonge Street. Fee parking, very bus accessible because its close to a viva stop! .  Decor:  It is bright with lots of window. A very small crowded dine in place. The order part is a small area when you watch in. I'm a big line up orderly person and ordering here sometimes gives me a wee bit anxiety. Line ups are sometimes not followed.  Getting food:  When you order and stay in, you go and sit and they bring you your food. OK. Once again anxiety, food doesn't necessarily come to people in the order that you ordered.  The Food:  It is great. The chicken in the peri peri sauce is delicious. It's rotisserie. Succulent and flavourful. You can get it in different spices. I like mild, I'm a bit of a heat wimp. You get a number of choices for sides, I always pick the corn. It's spicy and juicy. Yum.  You can get plain bread or garlic bread. You can't go wrong with either choice. The bread is soft and heart. I really like it. Salads are hearty and filling too.  The thing I love getting here is the chicken livers. You get a bowl of them they are spicy and are perfect paired with the bread.  They do a really big take out business. I'd say 90% of the orders while we were there were take out.  Conclusion:  It's great food for a fast food place. Reasonably priced too.  I think it literally has something for everyone."}
