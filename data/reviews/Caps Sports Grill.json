{"text":"Very friendly staff, Heather was awesome and the owner, Dave, came out and visited. We were driving through Phoenix on our way back to Tucson from Sedona and the Grand Canyon and was looking for a place to stop on the north side to let the work traffic thin and found Caps on Yelp. The boneless mild wings were delicious. We had several salads and they were huge! Several ordered steaks and were pleased. Mom loved the grilled veggies and bonus was ladies night with $3.50 margaritas, Mai Tais and martinis! Glad we found it! Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, there sampler plate is fried to perfection, it does taste like they use the same frier for everything but it adds a good flavor. And they have great customer service. The wings are delicious try them grilled. I actually want to compare them to valley luna's grilled wing. The bathrooms are a little geto there is writing on the stall walls but appears to be very clean but is on sever need of seat covers."}
{"text":"After reading the mostly good reviews, my wife and I packed the kids in the truck to try Caps.  We should have stayed home.  There was one other table seated that was finishing up their meal.  The server was good at first, offering me samples of a couple beers so I could choose one.  Things went downhill quick from here.  Shortly after we ordered food, we were the only table seated in the dining room.  The wait for our food which consisted of chicken fingers, a burger (well done), and a dozen wings was nearly 30 minutes.  Wings were ok, about as good as the ones I make at home.  The chicken fingers - well you can't really mess them up without trying.  The burger was beyond well done and into the charcoal stage.  Why would you serve this burger to paying customers?  Since the server didn't come back to check on us, my wife went to find her about the burger.  And find her she did - playing with her hair at the bar.  So much for food handling - I should have paid attention to the thumbs on the plate when my food was brought to the table.  At no time did my wife notice the server washing her hands after they were all in her hair.  We ended up with half the family eating in the restaurant, and the other half of the family eating the wings that we took to go (they replaced the carbon burger).  The empty tables in Caps should have tipped me off, but I was hopeful.  We left disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing service! My husband and I have only been here twice, but they immediate recognized us greeted us with smiles, remembered our drink order and treated us like friends. Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Update:  So since my review I have noticed that I can't tell who is cooking when. It is always delicious. I still go very often just order food every time now. Girls there are all still great!!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Servers are very nice. Good atmosphere to kick back and enjoy a beer with friends."}
{"text":"Best. Ribs. Ever. Seriously, it's hard to find fall of the bone tasty ribs in Phoenix but somehow this is the place for them.  My server was Tonya and she was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled and checked on us throughout our meal.  The decor is simple but comfortable and overall has a great vibe to it.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to watch the games! The food is awesome and the servers are courteous and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Caps has been one of my favorite stops on the way home. On a recommendation I brought home a dozen grilled wings. Sauce or no sause, they were excellent! Check them out and let me know if you know of any better."}
{"text":"Friendly service (7 people in the place 5 at the bar. 1 two top) Owner walk by me twice  (hey I see you would of been nice)  Proceeds to demand the bartenders attention that I'm pretty sure it could of waited ( she made eye contact that was cool) Still sitting ..........(in my heels complete formal business attire) my friend arrives ...10min+ after me  Bartender is released by owner to maybe allowed do her job  Very friendly apologizes cool not her fault  Beer I ordered is old Expired Be prepared to pay for mayo on a BLT. Don't plan on staying after 10pm (owner is ready to go)  I would stop in to say hi to the bartender  Would not eat! Maybe a straight shot from a freshly opened bottle ??"}
{"text":"This place is fun to go shoot free pool and watch football and they have great pizza and wings! However the wings do not come with ranch, carrots and or celery unless you pay extra. I think it would be nice to have the option to get them free with original order of wings like any other place I get wings at."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar.  The owner and servers are all fantastic!  Drink specials during happy hour are very good.  My favorite food is the double decker grilled cheese.  The pizzas have all been good as well."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! I've been here several times. Happy to have this place a mile from my house. Wonderful service each time I go!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Arizona a few months ago.  This was the closest bar to our house so we decied to stop by real quick to watch the hockey playoffs.  What we found was a diamond in the rough!  The bartenders here are simply just AWESOME!  Their customer service and bartending skills are top quality, and we always enjoy chatting with them.  It's never rushed either, they make you feel very welcome and cared for.  Dave is the owner and is constantly taking care of everyone.  You always see him making sure things are in good order and that his customers are happy.  We love the atmosphere but it's truly the customer service that keeps us coming back for more; and the FOOD!  The food is simply incredible!  The Patty Melt, Cajun Wings, Pizza, and Pulled Pork Burrito are some of our favorites, but honestly everything on the menu is delicious!  They do have the NFL ticket, NHL package and MLB extra innings, so this is always a great place to watch Sports!  If you haven't been before, GO!!  Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"Had grilled hot wings and a Left hand Nitro Milk Stout there last night. All of it, from the food and cold beer, to the great people, was fantastic"}
{"text":"Love this little mom and pop sports bar. Best wings in town and great service. The owner walks around and always makes everyone feel welcome. Hidden gem! Worth the drive from Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very accommodating with the games on. Fresh guacamole is amazing. Wonderful staff"}
{"text":"First time here doing happy hour. Met the owner Dave, he's awesome with telling us what's good and the specials all week long, he was even our waiter the whole time we were there. Had the chili cheese fries and they were bomb, wings are good too lots of different flavors to choose from. A true sports bar!!Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem sports bar.  Staff and management are extremely friendly.  Televisions everywhere showing all games.  The best wings in town."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the football games, had heard Vertu good things from friends. Very clean place, lots of tv's for watching games, full bar area as well as dining room. This place is my new favorite. It was not crowded at all, the owner is very involved and comes around to interact with the patrons. All of the food was excellent, and very reasonably priced. The bloody Mary I had was also one of the best I've had. The best thing about this place is the wings. They make all of the sauces in house, and you can mix flavors (hot and garlic mixed is superb) and they come either fried our grilled (tried both and I like the grilled the best, both are amazing though). Don't hesitate trying this place! It's awesome and will be my new place to go for football!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing, Very friendly , home warming feeling. Food is delicious, not a long wait for food to come out. Owner Dave came an greeted us an welcomed us. I would recommend this place to anyone. Not very crowded which i like. WINGS are amazing!!!! Server was on top of drinks an making sure we had a good time. TV are also good if watching football games."}
{"text":"Had lunch on break with a friend from work. Awesome chicken fried steak ;) quiet atmosphere like the set up friendly staff"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends to watch the football game.  Great place to watch the game, lots of TVs in the bar area.  Dave, the owner, introduced himself and made sure everything was okay.  Our server, Heather, was awesome!  The wings are excellent.  We all agreed we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is known for its wings and fun, laid back atmosphere  (unless it's a Sunday football game)   The staff is awesome and you won't find Dave (the owner) sitting on his butt, he's either behind the bar serving a cold glass of beer or out on the floor making sure everyone is enjoying themselves!   Can't find this kind of place in the corporate world! Big screen TV's, local neighborhood bar and family owned?!? Yep! it's all you need...well and a big pile of those wings with ALL the extras of course!   I bring friends and family in every chance I get! I make it a point of going a couple times a month and you should give it a try too, you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town!! We love this place! The atmosphere is relaxed, the waitresses are excellent and the owner comes and checks in to see if you are enjoying your food. There are tons of TVs, a fabulous selection of beers and have I mentioned they have amazing wings?!"}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place last night for the first time since we've lived in the area-over a year now. What a great place! We met Dave, the owner and Heather, one of the bartenders. Great people working here-customer service is top notch -they really want to make sure you are taken care of. And the wings were the best I've had in AZ! New neighborhood bar for us:)"}
{"text":"Locals abound,l and  beer are cold. Tried the BBQ Beef sandwhich with Fries. Fairly decent, if a little bit greasy. Fries were mighty tasty. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"The more we go to Caps, the more we like. Last visit I had sweet chili ginger wings- grilled. Seriously---- that's what's up. The wings were cooked perfectly! Juicy with sticky sauce- never fails me. Last time we met the owner, a Pop of the mom and pop. He was friendly and checking on all the customers all night. He offered to put our game on one of the many large TVs. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar for drinks and food. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Wings are amazing and nice place to hang out with friends and watch the games."}
{"text":"Off the city. Nice place, great service. On the super bowl day its a nice place to hangout. Wings tasted yummy."}
{"text":"We visited here recently and the food, service & decor have definitely been upgraded over the last few years. Wings were a big hit at our table!  Overall, still a great neighborhood place to get a drink and tell some stories - Now a good place to have a bite too."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  Higher prices, bad service, we'll go elsewhere.  Our team as well as several other teams used to hang out hear after volleyball leagues at DVCC just up the road.  Service has been continually declining and last time we were there, we couldn't even get a server to make eye contact.  After about 15 minutes, we finally placed our order at the bar.  There were two other parties of 2 in the place.  All the other teams have already left and now we're gone too . . . ."}
{"text":"Definitely five stars for this place, Caps! The place is clean, great atmosphere, awesome staff, but best of all you can get a GREAT meal at 9pm. The boneless wings were awesome and there's a ton of sauces to choose from. Not to mention great beers on tap"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, I ordered a pitcher of beer and was so upset with the service that I left without even finishing my first beer. Initially I walked in and was ok with the place until I realized there was a good amount of people that gave me and my friend the look of you don't belong here at the bar. We ignored it and decided to sit away from majority of the people, I sat down and ordered my beer and asked if they could change the tv right in front of us to the playoff game. The waitress/bartender said yeah and walked away to get our drinks. Another waitress comes to take our food order and had an attitude while she was taking our order. I asked her if she could get the channel changed to the playoff game considering the only reason I went is to watch the game. She snaps back and says we can't change this tv because someone else requested this game, so I asked who and she pointed to this White guy on the other end of the room with his back towards the tv with a big ass tv right next to him. I explained to her that he's not watching the tv and she gets an attitude and says oh well. My friend walks up to the bar and asks to speak with a manager and the first lady smacks her lip walks around the bar and talks to some couple then afterwards goes to the white guy and asks if she can change it. By this time it's about 30 minutes in and I'm already feeling uncomfortable in the place and beyond upset at the way we're being treated. They change the game and leave it on the menu to where the game is on a very small screen at the top left of the tv. I walk up to the bar, tell them to cancel my food order, paid for my beer since I chugged most of it and started walking out. I had a horrible experience however at the end there was this really nice old lady who came out and asked what had happened and tried to fix things but by then it was already too late, I paid for my beer cancelled my order and was already up. We went to half moon and had a great time with great service from the beginning. I gave this place an extra star because I believe the old lady was the owner and had good intentions just bad workers."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this place. I've been here 4 times. The regulars are very quiet, and no one likes loud anything. I admit that when my buddy and I wanna get a few drinks in us, we get a little loud. This place feels like a library. Good is good. Service is good. Prices are fair. Atmosphere is ok. I guess it comes down to the fact that I'm not allowed to cheer when my team does well. I know... Most of you will think that I'm that loud mouth guy. I'm really not. I've heard other people tell me it's too quiet in there."}
{"text":"Good wings. But be prepared to pay extra for ranch celery...really anything sloppy ex sauce.anything custom. Service..ok. Close early so not a place to chill after like 1030. And owners are always hovering over the bartenders so if you have more than a couple drinks you will be cut off. Good points....it's clean. Food is good. Andre is awesome.  Tonya is amazing to her customers."}
{"text":"Lots of bars and restaurants do chicken wings but putting out the perfect wing that is another story.... I've been here a few times and absolutely loveeeeeee their wings! So this review is NOT about the bar or the other food they serve, it is solely based on  their wings. That being said the majority of their food is excellent and above average for \"bar type food\". I cannot find anything wrong with Caps. It is never too crowded or crazy, never too loud or dark, it is a  great spot for drinks, good food and socializing.  Now back to their wings...I can't even think about this place without an insane craving for their wings.  They have the perfect wing. They just the right level of sauciness, at very reasonable prices. Plus he wings are usually prepared quickly, although any wait is well worth it.   THE BEST OF THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS ON THE PLANET!!! Served piping hot, perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside.  The wings are amazing. Seriously if you want to try something that is out of this world get the wings the way you normally enjoy them and then ask to get them grilled. OMG!!!. You'll never have wings crispier or juicier than this. The wings are amongst the best I've had  and I've had wings across the country and just ask my wife, I can be very critical of wings. Caps wings are seriously addicting! delicious wings.  FOOD: You can get your wings dry or soggy or even better get them grilled. Mouth wateringly delicious. Very very flavorful.   The texture of the wing is spot on.  PRICE: SERVICE: The staff is always nice & reasonably attentive.  AMBIENCE: Awesome neighborhood atmosphere CONCLUSION: Good size and the portions FANTASTIC wings! I am a wing guy, and VERY particular about my wings and these wings are GREAT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wings are fantastic!!! They have dozens of different flavors... they will mix together whatever you ask for... create your own flavors  Delicious!!! And friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the fact the owner walks around and asks if you're okay makes it worth it. They have local beer on tap which I appreciate. Good hole in the wall bar."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better. They have the best wings in North Phoenix, and the beer battered fish isn't bad either!!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to this sports bar and I really love this place.  What makes this place so different is the owner Dave. He's always out and about talking to customers, explaining the wings, and just making everyone feel at home. Now for the wings - best I've ever had. Ever. They grill them which gives them a nice touch. Good selection of IPAs which is important to me.  There's a TV anywhere you look. Love this place!!!  Why go to a chain restaurant when you have a gem like this."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this place is. Great service and great food. The wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Pac 12 Network is available and tons of college football playing around you. If your looking to watch college football and not listen to music while having some food and drinks this is the place for you. Staff and owner very friendly.  1/2 lb Angus Burger burger was good next time I will try the double patty. My girlfriend had the garlic bone In wings half grilled half regular. It was cooked well however since we are used to Buffalo Wild Wings we assumed there would be some sauce on the wings and not just seasonings. We will ask to have wings with sauce drizzled on top next time."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, given that my boyfriend had been here before and said the food was great. It was mediocre at best, with the wings being severely overcooked to where I could only get through a few before giving up. The ranch was odd tasting... Maybe bad? And the water tasted horrible, like water fountain water. I'd expect more from a restaurant. And I expect more from a restaurant that claims they have \"famous\" wings, yet couldn't get them right. They do get 3 stars for service, though. The waitress was wonderful. But that was the highlight of the visit, sad to say. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and awesome atmosphere! Went there for lunch with some friends, first time in and the bartender Tonya was amazing. Answered any questions we had, made some great recommendations and was very friendly. Highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for above average food and perfect service at a reasonable price! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good beer prices.  Wings are good, but take a long time (especially if you want them grilled).   Service is less than impressive.   There's lack of organization.  They try to take the wrong food to the wrong table and there are no real assigned sections.  We recommend sitting at the bar.  That's where you will get better service.  Also, if you don't see a white cube parked in the lot, keep on driving.  The cube belongs to Bree, one of the bartenders.  She is the only real positIve thing about that place.  She is really nice and always smiling.  The other two bartenders/servers that we've seen are not all that."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I've ever had! Fantastic job. Between my wife and I we ate 32 wings. That filled us up big time but we were super hungry. I love the variety and options you have here. Tons of flavors to mix and match. Many techniques in which  they will cook them. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite sports bars in PHX. First the owner is present and engaging and always walking the restaurant talking to customers. Next...they have several different types of wings...the grilled honey jerk are my FAVORITE. They're a sweet, spicy dry rubbed wing. They have traditional bar food but the quality is better. Great place to watch NFL football on Sunday's too. Awesome little neighborhood sports bar!"}
{"text":"We waited a good 15 minutes before being greeted.  There really are no specials, just discounts on beer.  And no one could verbalized what the specials were.  The Wings are priced per the pound and go up and down each day.  Veggies cost extra.  Once we finally got our drink order, we still had no menus.  When we told the waitress, she said \" I know, I'm getting them\"... never apologizing for the wait or disorganization.  Then, another 10 mins past, the other wondering waitress finally took our order.  She said \" sorry folks, we're just all over the place today.\"  Which tells me they need management and training.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Just found this joint thanks to my Friend Kevin. Place is awesome and reminds me of some great restaurants in OC California.   Friendly crowd and staff. You can feel natural vibes here.   Lakin the waitress was so nice and the owner Dave even said hi and checked in.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here and what a hidden gem! The service was impeccable, food delicious, beer ice cold, wings were awesome (trust me when I say my husband is the pickiest about wings) and the owner Dave was super friendly. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken wings and beer. The hot ancho chilli grilled bone in are my favorite. I come here at least once a week to catch a game and get some wings. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Dave and his staff are awesome.   This place is one of the greatest family oriented sports bars in the valley.   Everyone is always super thoughtful and considerate of the other patrons.  My kids absolutely love it there!!!"}
{"text":"Love me some caps. Great atmosphere to unwind after work with a couple friends.  Average beer selection and food is good. My only complaint was I felt that certain areas inside the bar were a little dirty."}
{"text":"Caps Sports Grill is well-known place, at least among my friends, due to their great service and delicious wings!   OMG, I haven't probably tasted such amazing wings in whole Phoenix! The guys truly know their business! I like that here I can choose how I want the wings to be cooked depending on my mood: glazed/grilled/sauteed/ deep fried and so on! I am definitely into their liquors, those are reasonably prices and very delicious! My husband also enjoys this spot as it is perfect for watching football games with drink and a wing! Great!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I went many times when I moved to the area last year, and each time it was just an average experience.  They have TV's and the baseball package so that was a plus.  The draft beer was never really cold and didn't taste very fresh.  Tried many different ones so it wasn't just one.  The owner and bartenders were nice and attentive.  The food was just average.  The wings were the best thing I had.  They were cooked well and the sauce had good flavor.  The Italian sandwich was lacking.  Where is the meat? The fries were fine but nothing special.  The jalapeno bottle caps were ok, but again I've had better.  This place isn't the worst, it just isn't that memorable either.  I've found better options."}
{"text":"Oh Caps. I used to love you! You upgraded your TV's and downgraded your service.   Last year I loved going there for early football games with my family. We'd eat breakfast and watch football. Everyone was so accommodating, and friendly. They would put the game we wanted to see on next to the table we were sitting at. Food was great. Service excellent.  This year, totally different story. Last week we went at dinner time for the NFL opening game. The service was horrible. They weren't even busy but our order was wrong, and we got over charged. We thought we'd try again this morning, and again were disappointed. They won't change the channels of the TV's, and they don't play every game. If they don't have your game on you are out of luck.   Really a bummer because we used to love this place."}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming exterior of this place fool ya.  My wife and I have been regulars here for a couple of years and are ALWAYS pleased with the service and the food.  Being originally from the Chicago area, we were in search of a pizza we felt could stand up to our expectations.  Yes, Dave and crew are known for their wings and I have been known to enjoy a few (get them double-tossed...you won't be disappointed), but their pizzas are notable as well.  We regularly enjoy their Combo-thin crust with extra marinara.  Marinara you say?  Their homemade pizza sauce is good but we like our sauce a little less sweet.  No problem.  Marinara is a tasty alternative.  ...and let's not forget the service.  The wait staff makes every effort to get to know their regulars and their preferences.  If they see us walk in, we are usually greeted with our favorite beverages and a  smile.  Dave patrols the place regularly and seems to genuinely enjoy his customers.    Drive down Rose Garden and you might not notice this place on the south side of the road just east of 19th Ave.  However, once you discover it, you'll be sorry that you didn't notice it earlier."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get food that was highly rated . Dave, the owner cares about food and service . He's become a friend to myself and my boyfriend . The food is great, especially the calamari . Give this place a try. And by the way .. he manages the TVs for sports which is awesome !"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great service! Wings are sensational! Thank you Tonya for the best Bloody Mary we've ever had!"}
{"text":"I needed to feed my men's softball team during a late night softball tournament at the near by Victory Lanes park. I called ahead and the server said that they could seat the whole team with no problem. Little did they know that we had party of 30! Well, to my amazement they had a section ready for us and a team of people staged to cater to all our needs. They promptly gave the entire team large glasses of water wthout asking knowing that we were out in the heat all day. Then gave everyone ample time to select what they wanted to eat. Unfortunely for the cook, we ordered 140+ wings at once along with pizza, sandwhices, and salads. He/she must have been sooooo overwhelmed, but guess what, our food came out as expected with zero issues. The wings were the absolute bomb! Much meater than what you get from Wild Wings or Native New Yorker. They even have all the same sauces that you would find at those chain resturants. Honey hot is my favorite and they were the bomb! I will definetly take the team back during our next tournament."}
{"text":"Went to this bar last night with a group of friends; the place is larger than I expected. The service was okay and staff was friendly. The bar tender helped us to make a good beer choice by offering us several small samples to try. Everyone in my group found a beer they liked at fair prices. A few of us decided to get the wings; no one complained. Everyone agreed the wings were very tasty... one batch seemed a bit on the salty side to me but the beer helped with that. I'd certainly try this place again."}
{"text":"My 6 year old and I walked through our neighborhood to eat here tonight. Definitely a hidden gem, we have lived here for years and have never tried. Food was better than I expected. Environment was OCD clean and the restaurant side is divided from the bar side so it was very kid friendly. My son had the pizza ( which he said was a little bit good .... high praise from the king of \" its disgusting\" ) I had seafood and it was good as well. They have TVs and asked us if we would like anything on . Highly recommend,  we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have frequented this establishment several times, its been a few different bars over the last decade the new one is very clean great service but the menu needs to get a little better the food does not stand out, get a BLT sandwich with microwave bacon just doesn't cut it. The pizza has always been good but the entire menu needs to be revamped. Great place to go have a drink though..."}
{"text":"Only been back in AZ a few days after 7 years in SO.Cal, wanted to have a few beers and food.  Found this place on Yelp, the service was excellent  (Heather) beer priced right we had an order of Hot BBQ wings and Teriyaki wings BOTH taisted extremely good .  Would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to kick back have drink or beer BUT DON'T FORGET THE WING'S"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a sports bar dinner.  I come in and sit down. I'm greeted promptly. Then they arrive very fast with my drink order.   The food is great. Dinner specials are second to none. I can't  get enough of their prime rib special. For less than eleven bucks, you can't go wrong.   They're appetizers are also tasty. I prefer the clam strips. They're bigger than most places and juicy.   Did I mention they have cheap beer?  Something like $3 a bottle... for imports, and quite a selection of imports.   Overall, this place is cool for a quick bite or meal and an inexpensive beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to love this place until our last couple of visits. Our most recent visit left us feeling so disappointed that we vowed to never return.  I'm not sure if they were having an \"off\" night but it was a Tuesday and not busy at all. But for some reason our service & our food were horrible!  Our servers seemed really distracted,  even though there were only 2 tables. I'm not sure why we needed 2 servers, maybe bc our order was too complicated, even though this seemed to complicate things more. We asked our 1st server for a pitcher of beer & the other server brought us something completely different than what we asked for. This happened twice! And since we are not complainers (other than this review)  we accepted what was put in front of us. After waiting 45 minutes for our food it finally arrived but looked disappointing as well. The normally delicious suicide wings were dry and extra extra  extra crispy. The over cooked wings tasted what I presume hay would taste like. It had me wondering if the cook forgot about them in the fryer as he stepped outside for a smoke, since there appeared to be no manager or owner on duty this night. My husband's roast beef dip was just as bad. The ajou was obviously watered down gravy. And our bill was the icing on the cake! We were charged for beers we never received...AND...I've always known they did this, but bc of the service I received it really irritated me this night.... Charges for ranch for the wings  and any extras we asked for, I was shocked they didn't charge us for the ketchup and salt and pepper bc we definitely used plenty this night! The only way we'll return is if we can bring our own condiments & cook the wings ourselves! Otherwise we'll have to find another neighborhood bar =\"("}
{"text":"Philly sand which was hot and melts, fries were crispy and delicious, and the wing menu is awesome! Service is great. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beer and great food. Eli the server was cool, and gave good food recommendations. I'll be hangin' out there on future business trips."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!  Management is great and food is delicious!!  Love that there is a juke box that is played throughout the restaurant rather than a radio station."}
{"text":"Love this place took my son in for lunch and had the twisted sandwich and wings, let me tell you the wings were off the chart!!! will def be going back!!"}
{"text":"Wings and fries good! Had a new server, super slow and non attentive. Bartender was more accessible for our needs. Too pricey!!! More than a dollar per wing and you have to pay for veggies and dip each separately. Good wings are everywhere that include dip and veggies. Will only return for great happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"I came in for the first time 2 nights ago and am back again.  The owner Dave and his staff are very professional and friendly.  I ha e been looking for my \"Cheers\" since moving to the area. I have finally found it.  It's called CAPS!!!  The prices are very reasonable and the menu has something for everyone.  I highly recommend CAPS with friends and/it family."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. Best wings in town, plenty of flatscreens to watch your favorite team, and the service is excellent. Everything else besides wings on the menu is typical bar food expectation, but im telling you, their seperate WING menu is awesome. Tons of different sauces and choices for how you can have them cooked. I get my wings re-tossed every time so they're dripping with goodness. Get there fast, this place fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"Caps is what you would expect from your local neighborhood bar. Very comfortable, friendly staff and good food. The owner is usually on site either helping the staff or chatting up the regulars. We always have a great time when we go here.  Try the Wings, they are the best I have found in Phoenix! And I have tried a lot of different places."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the wait staff attentive and the food was good.   I tried the pizza, it was a small personal sized thing with plenty of toppings and cheese. It totally hit the spot.   The price was great too. I think it was less then $5.   The captain and coke was poured perfectly and complimented my pizza! LOL 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I enjoy this spot for lunch. So many wing choices and great bar staff.   A little hidden, but that's a good thing."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Our group came in to watch college football and the owner Dave greeted us with open arms and made us feel like we were in our own living room! The restaurant was clean, bar was well stocked and OMG THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE. Everything we tried was phenomenal especially the wings. Tons of flavors to choose from, lots of cooking styles, all executed to perfection! Service is very friendly, which is always the icing on the cake.   Thank you for a great experience, we look forward to returning next week! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza & Wings! Very engaging owner, Dave. We're definitely coming back! We had a party of 10, 8 of which were 1st timers. We all agreed, great food!"}
{"text":"Caps is my favorite spot for the best wings in Phoenix. Dave the owner is always there making sure all of his guests are taken care of. The drinks are always good and they have different great daily happy hour specials. Keep up the awesome job!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new bar since I moved to Phoenix. The staff is friendly. The Prices are good. I liked the food. It has a laid back atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"The hotel I was staying at nearby recommended this bar the food was reasonably priced and pretty good overall. It is definitely off the beaten path.   I ordered the three cheese, grilled cheese with fries and a beer. It was really good and greasy! As you would expect for an adult grilled cheese. It went great with my ice cold beer.   They have a ton of TVs if you are looking to catch a game. The bartenders were friendly and nice. My only complaint was other than the bartender I was the only girl in the bar. That is what get for going to a sports bar. It seems like a locals place."}
{"text":"Stopped in during football to catch a vikings Game. Was happy to see other Minnesota fans there! Wings were good and beer was cold. We will try to make it back soon. Keep up the great work CAPS"}
{"text":"The staff is great, the drinks are good and they have all the football you could want to watch. The chorizo breakfast burrito is delicious! New to town and happy to have found this place, we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"So, every time I've been here it's been wonderful. This time (tonight) was ridiculous, we (my 1 1/2 yr old and myself) had a server we've never see or had before, and she was very forgetful and slow, even though she was running around like crazy. Weird since there was only 3 other tables that had people and two other servers/bartender. She messed up my drink order, our food came out cold, my sons cheese wasn't even close to melted in his grilled cheese. She forgot his milk twice and I finally had to ask a 3rd time, and she finally remembered. I had to wait about 20 minutes after I was finished eating for her to even walk by so I could ask for boxes. She brought them and forgot to drop off the check. Another 15 minutes after that she brought it out, finally. To top it off, when I left she asked \"you got it?\" From all the way across the dinning room, just standing there, as I was trying to open the door carrying my kid, diaper bag, purse and boxes.... \"yeah I got it\"... wtf. But whatever I guess, we will still come back here as long as we don't ever get her again. Oh and I forgot, she gave me a nasty ass look out the front windows as she saw the tip I left."}
{"text":"We were looking for a neighborhood bar and are so glad we found this one. It is clean, well lit and friendly. We look forward to conning here.   Edited on 2/24/18 - We stopped going here after a bit. We would go 3-4 nights a week for dinner since I was working a ton of hours. Unfortunately we became regulars and got ignored or maybe just taken for granted.   We were going to stop for breakfast this morning so I called to make sure they were serving it. Vickie said yes until Noon. We drove over just to find out they were not open and did not until 11. The sign on the door says 10. Why not just say that they open at 11 when I called in the first place?  My husband called her back to talk to her about it and she was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Dave runs a great place here at Caps! The best wings in the world, and the service is worthy of far more than 5 stars. Great selection of beer on tap, and a fun atmosphere. Plenty of TVs to catch every game on at any moment. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix and wanted to try a local place. This place was very good, service was great and the owner stopped at the table to make sure everything was ok. Would most definitely return next time we are on Phoenix."}
{"text":"Driving across the country and stopped in the area for the night. We checked out several other places and left immediately. Caps was a breath of fresh air. Clean environment, friendly staff and good food. The outside may not look the most inviting but that's because they put all of their effort into the inside. Pool table and plenty of tvs. Come inside, have a beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I are constantly on the hunt for good wing places and it has been TOUGH! I have had this place bookmarked in my Yelp for sometime now and decided to head over this past weekend for a quick bite. Well worth the trip!!   We were greeted right away and it wasn't very busy so we sat in a booth. Our waitress came over immediately and out in a drink order for us, we both ordered a bloody mary. It was delicious! Very simple with just some olives and lemon but the flavor was to die for. Highly recommend!  We also both ordered wings. My husband got the hot grilled and I went with the extra crispy Parmesan garlic. I was very impressed!!! The wings were so nice and crispy and the flavor was great!! I personally love a good crispy wing, I don't like them soggy, so these were exceptional!!   We will definitely be back to visit for some wings!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, very nice, clean place.  Great surf and turf special for Saturday night.  Not to mention very reasonable drink prices with happy hour all weekend.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my jam. Friendly folks, great service, solid prices, and amazing wings. I'd eat here everyday if I could. Gotta try the habanero hot grilled wings."}
{"text":"First time for my wife and I. Our son is a regular. We had the chicken avocado salad with clipolti dressing and split 10 medium wings. Both were 5 star and the friendly service from Dorothy will definitely bring us back! Kudos! :-)"}
{"text":"Always like stopping by here during football season. They have every game playing and happy hour going too. There wings are great and have a bunch of flavors. I highly recommend the deep fried and grilled wings. This time I tried the honey jerk Cajun. They leave a little fire on you lips but it makes you keep craving more..."}
{"text":"We love coming here for a quick lunch.  Tanya is our favorite server, she takes such good care of all her customers. They have a good selection of food from pizza, sandwiches, appetizers, wings and more."}
{"text":"Great place kind and friendly staff. New favorite spot to come. Great food amazing wings and good prices on drinks and food. Dave and Heather are some of the nicest people I meet and the rest of the staff are pretty good too. If your looking for a laid back place to eat drink or watch the game this is your place."}
{"text":"Good service, cheap, fun and the food is delish...what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Our nachos came with slightly warm cheese sauce, and cold toppings. I'm spoiled and used to real cheese, and nachos from the oven where the toppings get a little golden and hot. The fries were greasy, yummy and hot. Our server was very friendly and didn't mind us hanging out a little longer to watch the end of the football game which was nice and appreciated."}
{"text":"We go here almost every Friday since it's our neighborhood restaurant! We love the food and the atmosphere! Very relaxed and friendly! The owner Dave is always there and makes sure he says hi every time! Awesome family place to sit down and watch a game. They have 10 different mules which is my favorite!! Try the honey mustard hot wings! Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place.   Seems like a regular group for happy hour.   Drink prices are awesome, next time we'll try the wings."}
{"text":"Every football game, free pool, Dave (the owner) makes sure himself that you're happy. Favorite bar in the valley."}
{"text":"Wings are just okay. Nothing to really talk about, they were just there.  Beers are CHEAP!!! a shock top is 1.50...what the deuce?? Yeah i will be back!"}
{"text":"ladies,keep your husbands far away from this bar..the bartender HEATHER has been contacting my husband actually back and forth for both of them...is this the kind of place you want your husband to go to watch football..not when you have to worry about the bartenders hitting on your husband!!!! BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"This place was just super cool. Nothing special, but a great neighborhood bar and grill. We didn't order food, but the service was great and the beer was cold. Lots of locals here. If I am in the neighborhood again I would to try the food."}
{"text":"Had a friendly, casual greeting when I walked in the door. TVs everywhere labeled with each game (love when bars do that). My waitress was friendly. Seats were clean and comfy. Had the classic breakfast and it was tasty. I was impressed with the staff being accommodating to ppl who were asking for different games (cuz I guess the bar side was full for their game). The staff walked around asking who was watching what so they could change the channel. Then that table asked about the air and some other stuff. CAPS staff was really cool about it and kept a smile on their face. I'm new to town so glad I found a good spot for any game I want."}
{"text":"Wings were some of the best we've ever had!  Only drawback was the bar was too loud. We had to yell to hear each other. Had dinner on a Saturday night at 6pm."}
{"text":"Great wings and great service. The owner made it a point to get to to know us! I like to think of myself as a wing connoisseur.. And boy did they do a job well done! You not only have the option of wing flavor, but you can choose how they cook it.. *insert bubba gump voice * fried wings, deep fried wings, sautéed wings, grilled wings, glazed wings etc ..  And you get beat their drink specials! Premium liquor drinks for amazing prices! Can't find a better place to enjoy drinks, football, and the wings!"}
{"text":"Fantastic as always, Dave is great! Laken is our favorite! Food is fresh and wonderful"}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent but they want to charge for every single sauce and side of dressing. I paid an extra $2 in ranch dressing alone! Turns a regular menu item into a $20 plate. Just not worth it:("}
{"text":"Had to ask who made my wings they were so good tonight. Fredrick- outstanding! Great meal n great beer! Love me some Caps...  Another batch of wings down and still freaking outstanding! Thank you Caps for always having outstanding wings n beer(Firestone Union Jack)."}
{"text":"Good venue. Family owned, good drink selection, good eats and close to home. I've brought my son here before."}
{"text":"The wings were hot and spicy, the service was great, lots of draft brew to select from and well placed flat screens. If you are in the area it is worth stopping in.  Hard to locate from the road so look for their sign"}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch and the lady bartender was on point and asked for my drink order within 1 minute of sitting down. There was another lady serving food and she asked if I needed anything several times. So imagine my surprise when I came in for an evening drink. I came in at 625pm and not one of 3 waitresses asked if I wanted a drink. I had to get the attention of one waitress  after I'd been sitting at the bar for 6 or 7 minutes to get a beer. The waitress with the ponytail at the crown and the one with the ponytail at the back of her head both looked at me several times and didn't ask if I wanted anything. I will say thank you to Heather who was upbeat & nice and took my dinner order and made sure I had beverages. The Cap would've received 5 stars but evening service was very non or should I say anti-customer oriented, at least when it came to me. This is the longest review I've done to this point and that was due to the horrible evening service. Kudos to the lunchtime service. 5 stars to the ladies who were friendly & \"got it done\" at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood sports bar with great deals on canned 16 oz PBRs. Decent place to watch sports.  Servers are very friendly and the owner Dave is frequently working the bar when I go. Nice casual working man's bar. They also have a restaurant area with booths if you are interested in a meal. Food is pretty good.  A little tough to find - just south of Honeywell plant and Deer Valley Airport in an industrial area. Would have given it 5 stars if they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood bar. Decent place to watch a game. Better beer selection then you may expect. Food is average but no complaints, and fits the bar just fine. If your in N. Phx looking for a non-chain place to grab a bite and beer with lots of TV's to watch a game Cap's is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar and grill... A place where they know your name and the owner will take the time to check in with you to make sure everything is good. The personalization that everyone there takes the time to give you is very rare these days. Food, beer and cocktails are all good! Highly recommend you stop in and say Hi to the owner Dave!"}
{"text":"Good, simple American food, excellent friendly staff, good atmosphere, fair prices."}
{"text":"There are basically 3 bars near my house. Out of those 3, this one has the best selection of brews, they introduced me to Deschutes Red Chair, and for that I cannot thank them enough. Its fairly basic bar food, When I go my husband and I spit the cajun wings and I get a club.  I've never been dissapointed with this at Caps. The service is friendly, and I think everyone at the bar knows one another, very cheers-esque."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me so I took my family there for dinner.  The place was clean and has a decent atmosphere.  My friend recommended the wings.  They were ok at best, and came with an extra charge for 4 carrot sticks and 1.5oz of ranch.  We ordered the Italian hoagie, a philly cheesesteak, a salad, and a pizza.  The Italian hoagie was described as \"salami, ham, & pepperoni, with sauteed onions, tomato, & lettuce with provolone cheese.  The salami they use is nasty!  I think they buy the cheepest cotto salami they can.  There was plenty of the bad salami on there, but very little ham & pepperoni.  The sandwich was greasy, & tasted like cheap meat.  Why not use genoa or hard salami, & make 30 cents less on the sandwich, but sell 5 times more of them?  The philly sandwich was a 7 outta 10, not bad.  The small house salad was good, but room temp.  We added bacon to it bringing it up to $6 for a small salad with store bought ranch.  The pizza we ordered was thin crust.  The crust had potential to be great, but was under cooked.  (I've worked at pizza joints for 25 years). The pizza came out with missing toppings.  I left it alone and waited 10 mins for the the server to check on us.  I pointed out the mistake & she told me that they're computer system made it hard for them to ring in pizzas correctly.  She offered to take the pizza back, but I just said \"bring me the missing toppings & I will add it to the pie.  After 15 mins later, there was no toppings brought to the table.  I flagged her down and asked about the toppings.  She said they would be right out.  Half of the pizza was missing meatballs & italian sausage.  She brought me a bowl of smashed up cold meatballs and dumped it on the pie.  I inquired about the Italian sausage.  She said it was smashed up with the meatballs.  It was not there.  I gave up on this place at this point.  It took 30 mins to get our tab.  I got charged for 7 toppings on a pizza that only had 3.5 toppings on.  The waitress did correct this.  I ate a slice of cold pizza with the wrong toppings on it for dinner & left angry.  I will never go back here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! Dave (the owner) takes great pride in every item on the menu. Atmosphere is casual with down-to-earth, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Considering the fact that I live less than 2 miles away, I'm surprised I haven't been here yet, and am kicking myself over it too. What struck me right away was the friendliness of the staff upon our arrival. We went there for wings, as all my fellow Yelpers tell me this is the place to go for wings. The wings DEFINITELY did not disappoint!! There are several options on how to have them cooked (regular fried, fried then grilled, crispy, or extra crispy), and then you have to decide what sauce to have them tossed in (22 different sauces, and a multitude of combinations thereof). My mind was racing, trying to decide what sauce I wanted, so Dave, the owner, happily brought out some samples to help me make up my mind. Dave immediately picked up on the fact that we were first time guests, and took the time to welcome us to his establishment and tell us about their specials. The food arrived quickly, and was well prepared; my boyfriend had the bone-in wings while I had the boneless. I noticed the meat came clean off the bones on my boyfriend's wings, meaning they were perfectly cooked. The sauces were flavorful, and the accompanying veggies and dressing were fresh and tasty too. The place has a casual, friendly vibe, and there were plenty of TV's mounted around so people can watch their favorite game(s). This is a nice, neighborhood bar. We'll definitely be back. Aside from the wings being OUTSTANDING, they have a good variety of foods on their menu. My only complaint about the place is the pool table. It was in pretty rough shape, as were the two cues (only one of them usable)... but then again, my billiards game is in pretty rough shape too  ;). If you're looking for a laid-back, friendly atmosphere in which to watch your favorite team, some good food and beer to go along with it, topped off with being treated like a good friend by the staff, then Caps is your place!"}
{"text":"All right folks: You have been asking for a better sports bar, and I am here to tell you that you have found it. The sports bar scene doesn't get better in Phoenix than Caps. Long have I been allured by the promise of wings and sports on tv by Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings only to be spurned by incredibly slow service and inconsistent food. Caps is the only sports bar that I have ever been to that consistently delivers excellent customer service and food superior to the competition. The wings are top notch and completely customizable, and fries are always delicious. Because I can count on them to get me in and out in a reasonable amount of time, I often visit during my lunch break during the workweek."}
{"text":"We get together with our good friends at least 3 times a month and we needed a new place to meet. After finding this location on the web we decided to check it out and Im so glad we did!! First off, we are all germophobs and the place was really clean. It wasnt crowded in the dining area so we were easily able to get a table, wait a booth, with no waiting. Our waitress was THEE best waitress I've ever had. Extremely attentive and very sweet.The beer prices were amazing and the wings were fabulous! We will never return to our old sports bar again!"}
{"text":"I found this place about 2 years ago. I love the service, food and the atmosphere. Great place for drinks or to watch any sporting event you can think of highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love this place. With so many franchises in the area it's refreshing to have a local business owner who really cares about his restaurant. He is there all the time and always takes great care of my family and friends.   The location seems a little strange at first because it's in sort of an industrial area but don't let that deter you. This is a destination for sure.   They have great food and a great selection of beer on tap. Their prices on both are a lot better than most other places in the area too. How can you beat that?   We have frequented this establishment for dinner and plenty of Sundays watching football. They have any game you want on Sundays and great deals on breakfast and drinks.   I highly recommend checking this place out. Try the wings when you come in. Best in town."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that is right down the street from us! They have happy hour for drinks all day on Sunday. Lots of specials throughout the week. Their wings are awesome and service was good. I was also very impressed Dave, the owner, came out to greet us since it's a was our first time there. Great atmosphere! we will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars I like the decor Was impressed when the server asked how I want my burger done (med rare), yet dissapointed when my burger came out well done (but kinda expected it too anyway) so i really didnt mind, and happily munched away on it.  Their pizza oven wasnt working  I didnt mind bc i had been craving a burger anyway, but then the side I chose was potato salad, and they didnt have that either :( no biggie tho. The bar was full of what must be thier regular mid-day happy/hour customers, an older working class crowd that must work in the buildings around CAPS. We had hoped to sit up at the bar, but they had it all on lock down, so we scored a high  rise table instead service was good, they checked on us often, and we had a pitcher or beer at a reasonable price. Id go back again. Id like to try thier pizza, when the oven is working of course ;)"}
{"text":"The staff are awesome. Very friendly and attentive. The wings are so damn good.  I'd like to talk about the other food, but I can't help but order wings every time I come.  Grilled, crispy, extra crispy, grilled and extra crispy.  The massive combination of flavors.  You just never get bored of the combinations.   Caps off to you guys.  Oh!  And great happy hour specials with a nice variety of beers on tap."}
{"text":"went into the restaurant part with my two young kids. waitress was nice and sweet. she was attentive and was really good with the kids. but that is about as good as it got. the portions were small. actually they were meager to be truthful about it. and I ordered some cottage cheese for my children wich was rancid and sour. the kids ordered off the kids menu. a 1 year old and a 3 year old. keep in mind the portions were so small  that I had to order a large basket of fries to just keep the lil ones happy.. my hamburger bun had mold on it.. I was so frustrated I just picked the mold off and ate  the burger wich was 11.99 and came with maybe a dozen fries.. what  a waste.. this place used to have large portions great food and reasonable prices..  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING.."}
{"text":"Popped into Caps because we were looking for a place to watch an NIT basketball game after a Spring Training game in Peoria. I sent them a message thru Yelp, and the owner responded that they would have the game on for us.  They were very accommodating, putting our game on where we could see it and even letting us have sound (they weren't very crowded in the restaurant area).   We ordered the jerk chicken wings and they were GREAT! Crispy and spicy, not dried out. They also have a great micro tap list.  It's in a little Industrial area across from the Honeywell plant. The bar was pretty full of locals at 4pm on a Tuesday! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and it had a good ratings. I just had to take my girlfriend to this place and see what it's about. Overall great food, good service and a filling dinner. I will be back for sure. My girlfriend also really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hands down best boneless wings I have ever had.  The staff couldn't be more friendly.  Driven past it several times and am kicking myself for not coming in sooner.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because my boyfriend lives near it. Didn't expect the place to exceed my expectations but, it totally did! The food was great. I had the Philly cheesesteak with fries, and my boyfriend had wings. We were both very pleased with our meals. The bartender, heather was her name, was very attentive and made THE best, freshest lemon drop I've ever tasted. The prices were reasonable and I was very satisfied with the service. Win-win! If you're in the area, stop by and give them a shot."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town.  This bar is nice and clean and the service is typically very good.  They have a nice selection of beer and lots of comfy booths and tables."}
{"text":"Could the service get any better?! I think not! Our server, as well as the owner, were both extremely friendly, quick, and accommodating. I also enjoyed the beer selection and specials. I ordered the Taco Pizza, which I have to admit I'm now pretty obsessed with. My coworkers all got wings and they raved about them! I'm not a football fan, but sat in the room on the left with all the sports fans since that's where my coworkers wanted to be. If you're not into sports, stay on the other side of the restaurant! The TVs are too loud to have much of a conversation, but awesome for watching the games. I didn't mind since I wasn't there to have a conversation, but it's something to consider if you're just there for the good food and good beer!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, clean kitchen these people are experts when it comes to quality"}
{"text":"First timer here from Pittsburgh and this place was fantastic. The wings were some of the best I've ever had (Hot Ancho BBQ) & our waitress (Bri) we had was very friendly. Also, Dave (owner) seems like a dude who would love to smoke some beers with you after work. Very friendly owner! Good things all around.   CAPS FTB!!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned business that is focused on pleasing their customers! We will definitely be back for the reasonably priced drinks, great fresh  salad, and fantastic wings!"}
{"text":"I go to Caps about 2 times a week. It's fast, tasty food and you get a small pitcher of iced tea (little need for refils). They always ask if you want a drink to go, just a great place for food and sports."}
{"text":"This place is strange. I have never been in a sports bar that was quiet! I mean all you could hear were people talking and eating! They had zero background noise like music or even the games or whatever was on the TVs could be heard. When I asked why so quiet, the bartender said it's how the owner likes it. Uh, ok. When my friend said he'd just turn some music on on his phone so he could hear something, the bartender said the owner would tell us to turn it off or down, which tells me we aren't the only ones who have questioned the lack of noise. It's off the beaten path and while it wasn't real busy on a Saturday evening, I'm guessing it's a place where \"regulars\" who like to hear other people's conversations go. Aside from the strange vibe, the wings were good, the beer was cold, and the bartender was nice. If you like quiet time, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet spot to get a beer and watch some sports, this is the place. My girlfriend and I found this place on yelp when looking for a close dive, and this is our new spot. The beer is cheap, food is good, and you have to have respect for an owner who goes out of his way to introduce himself and make you feel welcome. We will definitely be going here more for the friendly atmosphere and great prices. All this time I was trying to find a nice quiet spot with a pool table, I was mad that I didn't notice the pool table till we were leaving. Next time."}
{"text":"My coworker and I came over here for lunch the other day as its just a stone's throw from our office. Its a typical sports bar, nothing fancy, booths and TVs as far as the eye can see. The wait staff seemed friendly enough and we sat ourselves in a booth that had probably seen better days judging by the lack of functioning cushions.   The food was fast, fried and fatty - just what you're looking for here and they deliver. It was reasonably priced and came out exactly as ordered, so that's a plus. Is it anything special? No but like I said, you know what to expect here and it delivers on the promise. A comfy, neighboorhood bar to grab a domestic beer and a plate of fried food."}
{"text":"Used to go here a few years ago when it had a different name and the food was very good and drinks were cheap. Went here bout a month ago with my girlfriend and it was veryyyyyy bad. It was around happy hour and the bar itself was packed,. wee wanted to play pool, so we hung out in the front of the restaurant area. It took at least 10 minutes for the server to get to us, as she was very busy talking with the regulars. When she showed up, she asked quickly for our drink order and left before we could get menus. It took another 10-15 minutes for her to bring our drinks and then 5 + minutes for her to get back with menus. We waited 30 minutes for a burger and  a Philly cheese steak. My burger was WELL DONE instead of med rare to rare and my dates Philly was really dry. Fries were cooked to death. Altogether, a strong  warning not to return........"}
{"text":"Caps USA great place. Food is great. They have all sports. Service great as well. Dave, the owner, is so nice and there all the time. Think it's our new neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Caps is a great neighborhood bar.  It has everything that you want! Great prices,  great staff.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Second time here but it may be our last.  Ordered a pizza and a patty melt. My fries were perfect but let me tell you, there's nothing worse than a cold patty melt. I did eat it but that's only because our food took so long I was too starved to ask for a new one.   When the person who ordered the pizza says: \"I'd rather have Pizza Hut,\" you know that plate wasn't very good either.   I've only posted positive reviews on Yelp up until now but I guess it has to start somewhere.  The second star was strictly because I know the wings rock from the last time I was here.   Do yourselves a favor and stick to the wings and cocktails."}
{"text":"People keep telling me the wings here are great.  They suck, nothing but chicken nuggets just like at Sonic drive in, too spicy, dry.  The owner felt bad and took some off the bill.  I ordered another beer for my friend and the waitress took the old glass and filled it--didn't use a new glass!  Lots of rednecks and white trash here -- one tried to start a fight with us.  I WILL NOT be back."}
{"text":"Great food and drink spot. Can watch Pac-12 network and sports!  Excellent appetizers and wings too."}
