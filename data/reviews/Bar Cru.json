{"text":"Fresh sushi, the tuna bowl and salmon bowl were great. Would come back if in the area. The decor is a bit stark. Could use some more art."}
{"text":"Hands down, I've been won over by these guys.  Their sushi is creative and delicious (hello okra rolls topped with tuna tartar), their poke takes me back to Ishihara market in Kauai (except its fancier), but in my opinion, the real stunner here is the CEVICHE.  The sweet potato, the corns (crunch!), the sauce, the seafood (I chose shrimp and tuna), the textures, the flavour, the freshness...all of it shows that they've put a lot of care and thought into their product.  And that's what's important. Maybe my one tiny gripe with the place is it's minimal decor but it seems that Bar Cru doesn't care to wow you with window dressing, it will wow you with it's well thought out menu, delicious flavours, and the warmth and attentiveness of the staff."}
{"text":"Got a ceviche bowl and the portions are tiny for $17. Size of an appetizer? Sure. Main? No."}
{"text":"This place just opened. Came in for a sushi snack after work. Really fresh, delicious sushi at a great price. Can't wait to come back for a poke or ceviche bowl."}
{"text":"Poke seems to be popping up as the hot item all over the place lately, but Bar Cru is the only one that seems to be doing ceviche so far. Though the servings are admittedly on the smaller side, but I do enjoy the quality, and flavours.  Great that it's on Ritual too, making a quick and easy option for a grab-and-go meal.  Just wish the portions were bigger, considering the price."}
{"text":"Super tasty and fresh! Had the octopus bowl and would definitely go back and try the others. Great service too."}
{"text":"This place was yummy fresh and quick! I left feeling healthily full. Quality of fish is good. Can't even smell it when you walk in (a great sign). The service is friendly. If I could change anything, it would be the prices, which are a little steep for the portion size."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood! The sushi is fresh and so tasty! Digging the casual approach to high quality sushi. The bowls (had the salmon bowl) are the perfect size; loved the rice which is not something I usually pay much attention to. The rolls are  delicious... Asparagus was a new experience but surprisingly good. The chef is professionally trained and it shows!"}
{"text":"Tasty salmon poke bowl with premium toppings but the portion is small for the price and the bowl is filled up with a lot of rice.  I got the salmon poke bowl here and it's good. But at $15 after tax, I felt the portion was lacking for me to justify getting this regularly or on a day when I'm very hungry.  It's a very clean and nice location with quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I tried the tuna ceviche bowl (with lime garlic sauce) and my partner had the salmon poke bowl. Decent quality fish and both had good flavours. One star lost because it's quite expensive - two bowls came to $32 and the portions aren't that big. The restaurant also isn't quite set up yet, seems to still be under construction, although didn't really bother us since we got takeout."}
{"text":"Had the poke salmon bowl. Was pretty fresh but the portion was too damn small for the price...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boss. He got the octopus like bowl and I got the spicy salmon bowl. I liked the spicy salmon bowl but the octopus was fairly bland.   I will come back to try out the sushi but it does seem a bit pricy."}
{"text":"above average food with small good twists... portion is very small though, for paying almost $15 a bowl, I feel only 50% full - I am 5 '3\" and wearing XS clothes....but if i were to order two mains...$30/person does not justify the food quality that I get either..."}
