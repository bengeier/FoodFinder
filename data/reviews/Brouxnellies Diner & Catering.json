{"text":"Was in Oregon for several weeks clearing out my parent's apartment. Saw that Brouxnellies seemed to have good reviews through local reviewers. I tried the place twice while I was there. I ordered burgers both time and did take out. Both burgers were very salty. I also didn't like that the fries were coated with something. The ciabatta bun was good but I was really disappointed with the overall meals. I have eaten at Brouxnellies previously while visiting my family in town. The restaurant is okay but I don't think that the food is anything special."}
{"text":"They are out of business.  Evicted by landlord for non-payment of rent and many health violations including a huge cockroach infestation.  It was in the local paper so I'm not making this up."}
{"text":"Upgrading my previous review. Service has greatly improved there in the past few months. Food is still OK but not great and the bathrooms still need to be cleaner."}
{"text":"Eh.  The first few times we went there, I thought it was good.  Their breakfast is decent, but nothing spectacular.  I do think that the prices are a bit high, considering the quality of food.  I get irritated paying almost the same price for a kids meal as an adult meal.  We went for fish on a recent Friday and it was kind of odd.  I can't explain why, it just tasted a little weird."}
{"text":"I will state that this is the worst restaurant that I have ever visited.  Ever!  I have been three times, each time the experience when I thought could not get worse, did.   My first experience was that my burgers not cooked, so when I sent it back my whole party was done their meal, and then some before I got my food back, with cold fries and no apology.  We ended up trying it again, this time I got the same server and again ordered a burger, this time a hockey puck would have been chewier then what I got.  I did not even touch it and left.    The last time I went I got breakfast, I got someone else's order.  That happens, I let the waitress know that their was a mistake, she went into defensive mode.  All at the same time, the person's food I got was right behind me.  We switched plates and thought it was done and had a good chuckle about it.  Then we got the bill, she billed me for the other persons food and vice versa.  I showed her the mistake and then the manager came over.  I know it is their job to defend their staff, I expect that but when you have two people in front of you trying to explain the issue you should some times realize that the customer sometimes is right.    Three strikes your out...."}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4x in the past  6 months and I have gotten either the turkey ruben sandwich with sweet potato fries or the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were very good and filling. Price is good, staff was nice and quick. Felt a little cold each time I was in there but otherwise clean and not to busy at the time. My folks both tell me the soups are very good although small in there portions. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Greg DeBroux provided us with a post-wedding brunch that got raves from friends and family. He worked with us when the numbers were larger than we expected - and never lost his cool.  We'd highly recommend his catering for a small or medium-sized event."}
{"text":"This place has been renamed DeBroux's Diner (or as they say in Chicago - DUH-bros).  This is a four star place with a five star server (Meggan) so it gets 4.5 stars in my book. The lamb sandwich was the best I ever had and the side dish of mixed vegetables was a world apart from the usual soggy bland stuff other places serve. The lamb and other meats comes from a local source which seems to add to the quality and flavor.  Meggan gets the credit for making the experience a great one. Without her I may have ordered something that was not as memorable as the lamb. She was also friendly, attentive (on a busy day) and smart.  I would go out of my way to go back there."}
